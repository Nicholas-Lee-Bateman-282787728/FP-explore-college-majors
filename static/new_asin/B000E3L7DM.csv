2487303,5,B000E3L7DM,"I am having the best time ever watching these precious Gidget shows!  Sally Field is so adorable!  Anyone who enjoyed the original series will absolutely LOVE this series on DVD!  Even my teenage daughter (who is not easily impressed!) thinks these shows are a hoot!  Even if it's old-fashioned, you just can't help falling in love with Gidget and her Dad.  Watch it for the cute fashions, even if you think it's corny!  There's nothing more fun than curling up on the couch and being transported to another time by watching this classic TV show.  I LOVE having Gidget - The Complete Series on DVD - in my DVD collection!",1142985600,11,621,4.590909090909091
2487304,5,B000E3L7DM,"""If you're in doubt about angels being real..."" So began the catchy, unforgettable theme from TV's Gidget. After Sandra Dee's trio of Gidget beach movies, Sally Field took the role and made it her own. This series was unsurpassed, made at a time when sitcom did not simply mean jokefest. It's not all laughs; there's real heart, teenage angst and working out of relationships. The college prof dad and shrink brother in law give ample space for working in the 'fifties fetish with psychology. The characters click; the chemistry's magic.

Now with The Flying Nun also soaring onto DVD, at last Sally Field can be seen as the talent she is. She doesn't have to play ""serious"" roles to shine. Light sitcoms like Field's and Patty Duke's were often dismissed by critics despite being wildly popular. The 32 episodes on these four discs may enable a reappraisement, and with the entire series on DVD, fans will have a Field day.",1142899200,88,924,4.775
2487305,5,B000E3L7DM,This is one of the best shows ever made and I can't believe that it's taken so long for it to be released on DVD. It totally stands the test of time and has great characters. In the past it's only been issued on two pitiful VHS collections with only 3 episodes each. It's really too bad that there was only ever one season. Don't miss the Episode featuring Paul Lynde; it's without a doubt one of the best TV moments of all time!,1142121600,11,429,4.119047619047619
2487306,5,B000E3L7DM,"Gidget was based on the movie series with a young Sally Field in the title role of Francis ""Gidget"" Lawrence. The show has a fun 60's surf setting with Gidget facing the typical teenage troubles of high school and dating. The true heart of the show is the relationship between Gidget and her father, Professor Russell Lawrence (Don Porter).  The show is a somewhat dated due to the fact it is forty-years old, but it still holds up thanks to the first-rate acting and the fact that despite the time or era, teenagers face the same trials and tribulations.",1140480000,33,555,4.606060606060606
2487307,5,B000E3L7DM,"I loved, loved, LOVED ""Gidget"" when it was being shown on TV Land...in the words of the late, great Trio Channel, it was a ""Brilliant but Cancelled"" series that deserved a longer run. A nice, fun piece of 1960s sitcom television, Sally Field showed early on why she'd make the mark she did in the entertainment industry.  Everyone else is great too...Don Porter is one of the most underrated TV dads of all time IMO.  And the likes of Lynette Winter, Betty Conner, and Pete Deuel are just delightful.  I am SO getting this one when it comes out in March!",1138147200,30,554,4.465346534653466

2487311,5,B000E3L7DM,What a lovely bit of 1960's nostalgia! Brings me back to my high school days. Sally Field and Don Porter are just great! Loved this series!,1515110400,,139,4.384615384615385
2487312,4,B000E3L7DM,"I cant wait to watch this!  Its a favorite from my childhood. My only complaint is the discs are stacked on top of each other in the case. Luckily, none were scratched",1514678400,,167,4.21875

2487314,4,B000E3L7DM,"Gidget, Was it really that long ago?",1511913600,,36,4.285714285714286
2487315,5,B000E3L7DM,I loved this series when it was on television in the 60's.  I wanted her wardrobe. I also wanted Larue's car.  It is a cute series.,1508976000,,131,4.0
2487316,1,B000E3L7DM,"I watched a few episodes of this series on Antenna TV awhile back and thought I liked the ones I saw. Granted, the show was on in the background while I was doing some work around the house. Out of curiosity I checked and found that the whole series could be had on DVD for only $6.99, which is an incredible price, so decided to order it.

Well, I guess I should have reconsidered buying the set, as it was a mistake for me even at this rock bottom price. Overall, I don't like the show. I didn't watch it when it was originally televised, and evidently is was scheduled opposite some other top rated programs of the day. However, it's easy to see why the show only lasted one year in 1965-1966. The focus is on teenybopper crushes, surfing, beaches, etc., so that limits the audience.

Sally Field later became an accomplished actress.  In the first episode of Gidget she suddenly breaks down crying, hard, an example of her acting ability, and while emotional and sad, it seems contrived and overdone. I was a pre-teen at the time this show was originally broadcast so it's from my ""era"" as a youth, but as a male I would not have liked this as a teen, and it's hard for an adult male to appreciate. I suspect modern kids wouldn't have much interest in this show.

I respect all the reviewers who fondly remember this show, purchased this set and love it, and yes it is harmless fun, but after viewing a number of the episodes,  I personally just don't care for it.  However even if you only have a modest interest in this series, the price is so low that it is still a good buy.",1508457600,,1582,4.327702702702703
2487317,5,B000E3L7DM,"I remember this show when I was younger.  I give the content five stars, but the case containing the discs is the worst I have ever seen.  I guess I couldn't expect much since the price was so low, but Mill Creek could have done a better job.

When I first opened it I thought there was only one disc and wondered if they crammed the entire series on one disc.  To my surprise there were two more discs underneath.  I quickly moved them to their own cases to protect them from getting scratched.  Shame on Mill Creek for being so cheap.",1507766400,,536,4.205882352941177

2487320,5,B000E3L7DM,"Who doesn't love Gidget?  She was pretty, smart and carefree!  This is a ""feel good"" series that always puts a smile on my face and makes me wish I was a teenager in the 60's.  My teenage daughter loves watching this.",1503619200,,217,4.2439024390243905
2487321,5,B000E3L7DM,"Cute, charming, and yes at time quite sexy! Field was actually 19 when she portrayed Gidget, and at times it shows! A throw back to a time when college aged guys could date a cute 15 yr old, without her parents calling the cops! Of course Hollywood takes the nubile lovely Gidget, and in their infantile wisdom turned her into a nun!",1503187200,,333,4.387096774193548

For example, Barbara Hershey, Bonnie Franklin, Walter Koenig (Chekov on original Star Trek series), Richard Dreyfuss, Judy Carne, Paul Lynde, to name just a few.

2487434,5,B000E3L7DM,"PRO: I love this series!
CON:I wish there had been more seasons

If you like Sally Field this is a chance to see her in her first role as GIDGET, teen daughter. The show is sweet and is from the early 1960's pre-rebellious teen era, when teens actually respected their parents. Gidget loves her dad, considers him her best friend and relies on his wisdom, something you do not see on teen TV in today;s world. I can't say enough about how cute this series is! You will not be disappointed with GIDGET starring Sally Field!",1462233600,,522,4.4375

2487457,5,B000E3L7DM,"I loved the Gidget tv series when I was a teenager and was sad when it was cancelled.  It gained popularity when it was shown in reruns (the summer it was cancelled) but, by then most of the cast had found other jobs.  Namely, the main star, Sally Field had the lead role in The Flying Nun, which also was popular.  Recently I discovered that Gidget is shown by my cable provider on Antenna Tv on Sunday mornings - two episodes.  When I saw that Amazon had the entire series - 32 episodes - for only $5 - I immediately ordered it.  Now I can watch it any time I want.  I highly recommend this for both the older and younger generations.  The younger girls will love the outfits that Gidget wears as they are right in style now.  Fashion cycles repeat themselves.

2487478,4,B000E3L7DM,"I like Sally Field, but she is not why I bought this complete series. I bought it because it was Pete Duel's first series. Although he is not in every episode, which is only fitting since he was not the star, he is still in enough of them to make it worthwhile. The show itself is typical 60's fare, cute, but not much else. It's one of those shows you watch when you just want to escape the real world and float away on silly and cute frivolity. Sally Field is very young in this and I believe this was her first series as well. It's great for nostalgia to see her when she was so young and cute and to see how far she has come since then.",1445385600,3,640,3.9689922480620154

Like spending a day at the beach, your I.Q. may not be any better after watching, but you'll feel like you've had a little get-away from the day's problems.  And, yes it presents an idyllic world that never even really existed - even in Malibu in the 60's.  But, somehow as with a lot of the older shows, the basic characteristics of caring about others and treating them with respect seem to shine through in a way that today's entertainment lacks.

2487581,5,B000E3L7DM,"Sally Field in her 1st starring role in the role of teenage girl ""Frances Lawrence"" who is called ""Gidget"" in this very 1960's comedy that only ran 1 season filmed in color film though was a very popular and funny show. It was a Screen Gems (Columbia Pictures) produced show. It was a role Hilarie Thompson could have played. Her best friend is LaRue played by Lynette Winter. Mike Nader (who was in the Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello Beach movies of the 1960's) was one of Gidget's friends who went to school with her. Betty Connor played her sister and Pete Duell played her sister's husband in the show.",1420329600,2,612,4.572727272727272
2487582,4,B000E3L7DM,"Sally Field replaced Sandra Dee in the television series adaptation of the film series. It's hard to believe that Gidget lasted only one season with 32 episodes all here. Sally Field is perfect in this role as the lovable Gidget with Don Porter playing her father. She has an older sister, Ann, and brother-in-law, John. Then there is her best friend, Larue. The cast are first rate even if the writing isn't always the greatest. The series could have lasted a lot longer if possible but was canceled due to bad ratings. I don't know how ""The Flying Nun"" outran three seasons where this series only lasted one season but I wasn't around in the 1960s.

You have to believe that Sally Field has still held her own against the cast and others in film, television, and maybe stage. She is truly an American actress with two Academy Awards and other honors including a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for film. She should have one star for television as well. She should be given the ultimate American honor as a Kennedy Center Honoree for her services as an actress, producer and director in the film and television industry.

The 32 episodes is spread out on three discs. Guest stars included Paul Lynde, Bonnie Franklin, Ron Rifkin, Barbara Hershey, Hazel Court, and Richard Dreyfuss. I can't imagine anybody but Sally Field as Gidget now. I would watch the series in syndication as a child. I still haven't see any of the film versions with Sandra Dee. Sally Field hasn't changed much in the last 50 years that she first debuted on television as Gidget. She still looks the same physically with that adorable face.",1420156800,,1616,4.666666666666667

Unfortunately, ""Gidget's Career"" on disc two is missing the epilogue segment before the closing theme just like with the last episode of the first season of THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY on DVD.

The original release of these DVDs years ago had 4 DVDs so they were better quality because fewer episodes were squished onto a disc.  They also did NOT include ANY of the extras from the original release.  So you don't get the Sally Field interview about the show and the original uncut pilot episode.  Plus, they use the format where they just stack the discs cheaply on top of each other.

In particular, he found the first 2/3 of the season to have his favorite episodes, Gidget and her friends were largely at the beach in their swimsuits and bikinis, surfing and running around, the latter 1/3 of the season seemed to change direction, a lot of those episodes took place in their house and then he started losing interest.

Zorro never understood why Sally Field left Gidget to become The Flying Nun, not only covering up her body, but most of her hair as well, it wasn't until she made a triumphant return in Smokey And The Bandit, that he finally forgave her.

Sally Field as Gidget is a real charmer, much like Annette Funicello in the beach movies, these episodes are a lot of fun and come highly recommended by Zorro and myself.",1404604800,5,1007,4.497267759562842

The series is set in mid-sixties America and the surfing era. Expect lots of surf, sand and color. The prints are pretty good for a show that's nearly 50 years old. A young Sally Field (think she was 18 or 19 at the time) plays her role very sweetly and looks very attractive on screen.

My childhood memory recalled depictions of beach life and common teenage interests, but now I also see a refreshing portrayal of bygone times that contrast with our current culture.  Maybe we can revive some of the more positive elements.

Behind the humor, we are shown a loving and respectful father-daughter relationship.  Gidget also has a very loving bond with her newly married older sister.  Gidget's teenage antics sometimes unwittingly result in strains on these familial bonds, but the show's message is always the same:  these are ties that cannot be broken.

2487676,5,B000E3L7DM,"By the time ABC filmed this television version of it, Frederick Kohner's 1957 novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gidget/dp/0425179621/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gidget</a>&nbsp;(based on the adventures of his daughter Kathy), had already provided the basis for three motion pictures&nbsp;]  .  Unlike the Gidget films, however, the television series does not focus on Gidget's romantic involvements.  We rarely see her boyfriend Jeff, who is a student at Princeton; and her romantic interests are primarily limited to ill-advised infatuations that do not last beyond a single episode.  The television series devotes most of its attention to Gidget's relations with her family, her peers, and her teachers.  As with the movies, surfing is an underlying theme, but much of the action takes place away from the beach, and deals with such mundane subjects as school work, dating, getting a job, and learning to drive, as well as more unusual ones such as escaping from a ""haunted"" house, or evading a witch's ""curse.""

In coping with life, Frances Lawrence, whose diminutive stature earned her the nickname ""Gidget"" (a conflation of ""Girl"" and ""Midget""), gets advice, sought and unsought, from her father Russ (Don Porter), a UCLA English professor, her sister Anne (Betty Conner), her brother-in-law John (Pete Duel), and her best friend Larue (Lynette Winter).  ""Gidget"" captures the different dynamic that exists in a one-parent, one-child, family--Gidget and her father are especially close.  Anne is a somewhat conventional meddling older sister who is trying to make Gidget into a lady.  John is an aspiring psychologist who attributes nearly everything to subliminal motives.  Gidget customarily ignores their suggestions.  Larue is a rather eccentric figure, who visits the beach clad in clothing that conceals everything but her face (and sometimes that as well) because she is allergic to sunlight.  Gidget often gets together with Larue to consume exotic sandwiches and discuss whatever problem she is facing.  Despite her eccentricities, Larue's judgment is often better than Gidget's, but she sometimes gets drawn into Gidget's misadventures against her will.

Sally Field landed the role of Gidget through a summer workshop screen test.  She had participated in secondary school dramatic productions, but she had had no on-screen experience apart from being a supernumerary in the forgettable 1962 film, ""Moon Pilot.""  Although 19 when the program was filmed, Field is entirely credible as the 15-year-old Gidget.  And, in mastering this role, she gave early evidence of the acting talent that was to win her many parts (from the Flying Nun to Mary Todd Lincoln) and awards.  Her attitude toward the filming of ""Gidget"" was ""absolute total glee,"" and her performances reflect this.  Don Porter served as her mentor; and there was good chemistry between them, both on and off camera.  Similarly, Field described Lynette Winter as her ""best friend"" in real life as well as in the show.  Winter brought to her role a veritable arsenal of facial expressions, and a talent for physical comedy perhaps even greater than Field's.  It is hard to imagine ""Gidget"" without these three.  Conner and Duel successfully portray an annoying sister and brother-in-law; and Duel displays surprising aptitude for slapstick when he accidentally disconnects the water supply hose to the washing machine, drenching Anne, Gidget, and himself (we are left to wonder what the soaked cat, watching from a corner, thought of this human folly).

""Gidget"" is a conglomeration of 1960s artifacts--cars, clothes, hair styles, dances, record players, dial telephones, VHF/UHF television sets, and manual typewriters.  In terms of its cast, subject matter and attitudes, it is also a product of its times.  Occasionally, there are explicit, if not emphatic, references to sex, and to Gidget's physique.  And the cast includes African-Americans playing minor, but respectable, characters.  But the women are definitely not liberated.  One of Gidget's male acquaintances commands her, ""Go fetch food, woman!""  Her father tells one of her male classmates what to do ""when a woman clamors for complete equality with men,"" and implies that women really do not want such equality. Gidget receives a spanking in one episode, as does a visiting Swedish female student in another.  (No male characters suffer this indignity.)  As Gidget concludes in one postscript, ""I'd set back women's rights a hundred years--exactly where they belonged.""  Today, some of this may grate on the nerves, even of those not sensitized to gender issues.  On the other hand, in several episodes, Gidget attempts to improve the behavior of her male associates, and, more generally, her participation in surfing involved breaking into what had been a male preserve.

An episode of ""Gidget"" typically ends with sage advice from Russ, or--better--a humorous epigram from Gidget herself, such as: ""You're only young once; but if you work it right, once is enough.""  Or:  ""It's too bad you can't be born with maturity, then lose it when you don't need it anymore.""",1353456000,5,5154,5.437735849056604

2487681,5,B000E3L7DM,"Riding the waves with Gidget and the gang is like a delicious piece of apple pie - all-American, sweet & flaky -a recipe for happy teenage years.  This 1965/66 show makes me feel like doing the twist on the beach, grabbing a burger & milkshake with Larue and daydreaming in the sun.  It's impossible for me to feel nostalgic over this show, because my teen years came much later.  But I wish I had been a teen then, and watching ""Gidget"" allows me to live vicariously.  All ages will enjoy Gidget's wholesome fun.

Sandra Dee originated the role in the popular movie, and I didn't think anyone could capture the part the way she did.  Then along came Sally Field for the T.V. version.  She brought her own brand of wide-eyed sparkle to it & made it seem like the part was written for her.

The show follows Gidget's heartaches, crushes, friendships and her perpetual philosophies on life.  Fifteen-year-old Gidget is being raised by her father played by Don Porter.  Their relationship is one of the most endearing things about the show.  There's also a strong supporting cast:  Betty Connor as Gidget's bossy but well-meaning sister Ann, Ann's husband is played by Peter Deuel and Gidget's best friend Larue is played by Lynette Winter.  There are some fun guest spots, as well; including Harvey Korman, Bonnie Franklin, Richard Dreyfuss and ""All My Children"" fans will recognize a very handsome Michael Nader as one of Gidget's friends.

The show ran for only one season, but it provides a good deal of entertainment.  There are 32 episodes and a great extra, ""A Look Back at `Gidget,'"" with an enjoyable interview with Sally Field.  The DVD is great quality and the colors are vibrant.

2487698,5,B000E3L7DM,"In 1957, Czech-German immigrant Frederick Kohner(1905-1986) wrote the novel Gidget: The Little Girl With Big Ideas and Columbia Pictures made three big budget Gidget feature films from the book. Kohner's daughter Kathy was the inspiration for the Frances Lawrence/Gidget character. Gidget Goes to Rome(1963) underperformed and the producers played it safe by making a Gidget TV show. It doesn't offer any exotic locations, but it has plenty of plot and character depth. The Gidget TV show got high ratings, but the network still cancelled it after one season! It only lasted 30 something episodes. A young Sally Field took the Gidget role(played by Sandra Dee, Deborah Walley, and Cindy Carol) and made it her own. Gidget is a portmanteau for ""girl"" and ""midget"" as the first Gidget movie tells us. Don Porter portrays Gidget's father. We are introduced to Gidget's shy, ugly duckling friend Larue(Lynette Winter). In this TV show, Gidget has a sister Anne(Betty Conner) and a brother-in-law played by the late Peter Duel.
 Today's TV shows put an emphasis on gritty, ugly reality! Gidget(1965-1966) has a wholesome brand of fun as censorship was stronger in those days. Even in the 1960's, Gidget had to conform to a paternal, male-dominated society. In one episode, she had trouble blending in with mechanics. My favorite episode is where Gidget tries to comfort Larue after a vain beach bunny picks on her. Another good episode is where Gidget has a crush on a photographer and she's disillusioned to find out that he already has a fiancee. Sony Pictures did a superb job restoring the audio and video quality on these Gidget episodes. They're crystal clear! The unrestored episodes look like a muddy 8mm home movie. Gidget(1965) was shown in syndication in 1986. Although, the distributors had to produced The New Gidget(1986-1988) so they would have enough episodes to show. Gidget(1965-1966) is a nostalgic gem that deserves to be watched again.",1292716800,4,1951,5.135220125786163

2487701,4,B000E3L7DM,"Two time academy award winner Sally Field, got her big break at nineteen, starring in the television version of Gidget (1965-66), playing the impish, headstrong teenager Frances Elizabeth ""Gidget"" Lawrence.  Although the program lasted for just one season, it launched Field's career, as producer William Asher (Bewitched), selected the talented young actress to star in his new series The Flying Nun.  The role of Sister Bertrille, proved to be something of a blessing and a curse for Field, who eventually made the jump to films.

The Gidget character was already well-known, having been previously featured in motion pictures.  Screenwriter Frederick Kohner, based the character ""Gidget"" (a bastardized contraction of ""girl"" and ""midget"") on his daughter, who was enamored with the California surf scene.  Sandra Dee, Deborah Whalley, and Cindy Carol, played Gidget in the movies, prior to Field assuming the role.  The angelic Field is terrific, as the wholesome, beach-loving, boy crazy teenager, who gets into all kinds of harmless fun.  Her brightness, and youthful enthusiasm is captivating.

Gidget's relationship with her father Russell Lawrence (Don Porter), a college professor, is one with an astronomical level of trust.  He rarely lays down the law, or gets angry.  Also around are Gidge's married and slightly uptight older sister Anne (Betty Conner), and her studying to be a psychologist husband, John Cooper (Pete Duel, Alias Smith and Jones).  Larue (Lynette Winter) is Gidge's best friend, and partner in crime.

The series features a number of female writers, including Ruth Brooks Flippen, who wrote two of the Gidget movies, and her episodes are usually among the best.  The various writers produced sappy adolescent adventures, as well as stories with some provocative adult situations.  As a result, there isn't a consistent point of view for young Frances Lawrence.  The character wavers between a naive schoolgirl, and an emancipated college-aged adult.  Surfing and hanging out at the beach is featured in the early episodes, then almost totally disappears from the scene.  Gidget begins the series with Jeff as her steady boyfriend (sort of), but after he goes away to college, Gidget enters a phase of intensive dating.  A convention that seems to play out, is that Gidget's female friends have dark hair, and her enemies are usually blondes.  Friends include Barbara Hershey and Bonnie Franklin.

The series is another reminder of how special the 1960's were.  Here we have a fifteen year old girl, who spends most of her time running around unsupervised, doing just about anything she wants.  From hanging at the beach, to being with friends, to very actively dating including adult men.  Things are played out completely straight and innocent, with hardly an eyebrow raised, but Gidget engages in some pretty questionable behavior for a minor.  If she were eighteen, there wouldn't be as many issues, but at fifteen the writers are playing with fine.  Perhaps it is a sad commentary, but in 2010 a parent that allowed his daughter do some of the same things, might be receiving a call from child protective services.

Generally things tend to play better when the writers stick to safer, more age appropriate themes.  ""Take A Lesson"" features a wickedly sarcastic Paul Lynde, as the father of one of Gidget's friends, who takes Gidget along on a trip to buy a car for his daughter.  In ""A Hard Night's Night"", thinking the house is empty, Russ invites a friend to spend the night, with hilarious results.  Larue strums the guitar, and Gidge shakes a tambourine, in ""Gidget's Career"", as the girls join a musical group.  Gidget wants to make a good impression when she meets boyfriend Jeff's (Moondoggie) parents, but it's a fiasco, in ""In And Out With The In-Laws"".  Russ thinks Gidget may be working at an adult club, in ""Independence - Gidget Style"".  Larue is the subject of a makeover in ""My Ever Faithful Friend"", but Gidget is concerned that her father may have taboo thoughts about her best pal.  It's good dirty fun when Gidge buys interest in a car, and takes auto shop to learn how to care for it, in ""A Hearse, A Hearse, My Kingdom For A Hearse"".

For the most part, Gidget is innocent wholesome fun.  Sally Field is delightful, with her natural charm clearly shining through.  The acting talent that would someday be universally recognized (""you like me""), is certainly evident.  Don Porter and Lynette Winter, head up a great supporting cast.  The 32 episodes in this set look absolutely fabulous.  The quality of the original prints appear to be near flawless, and the lighting used in the production is quite intense, producing bright and shiny images, where faces glow and hair glistens.  About the only negative, is that the episodes are not subtitled.  The highly informative featurette, ""A Look Back At Gidget"", features Sally Field reminiscing about her experiences on the series, and leaves you just wishing that it was much longer.  Some of those associated with Gidget, would also go on to work on The Flying Nun, giving the two series a similar look and feel.  Fans of Gidget, will surely appreciate the gentle charm and innocence of that series as well.",1278806400,9,5212,5.03267211201867

2487704,5,B000E3L7DM,"This  sitcom  series is absolutely delightful.  It  embodies all the  fun  and  excitement that  young  people  crave  for,  but  excludes  the  sexual  explicit  material  and  tasteless  humor  which  are the  prevalent  elements included in so many of now  days  sitcoms.  Most  shows  end  up  even with a moral lesson,  which  Gidget  herself presents so  well,  often in  delightful,  amusing  manner,  but  not  stripping  it  of  value  by  frivolousness, which  also is  prevalent in modern  sitcoms.  Those  shows appear  surprisingly modern,  with  no  lacking  of  action and  witty  situations,  and  frankly,  the  only  difference  is  that the  characters  don't  walk  around  with  cell phones  glued to  their ears,  the  cars  are  different looking and  their  wardrobe differs.

And as I was watching it, I was thinking, ""Why did this series only last one season?"" There is a commentary by Sally  explaining that it was in the top ten but somebody in the network made a mistake and cancelled the program without realizing that it had made the top ten. Obviously they must not have actually watched the show!! Executives!!!
I also absolutely loved the actor that played Gidgets father, Don Porter. They really have a wonderful on-screen chemistry. He is a sweetheart to her but it isn't sappy.  Peter Duel, who was in the TV series Alias Smith and Jones, plays Gidgets brother-in-law. He is very funny as a psychology student always attempting to analyze Gidget and her father.
The acting is very good in this show and I'm watching them all for the third time. There are some episodes where Gidget is crying and it still makes me cry even though I've seen these scenes before. There is a hilarious episode with Paul Lynde playing a very negative father to one of Gidgets friends. There is another very funny episode with Richard Dreyfuss playing a nerd who develops a huge ego due to Gidgets ""trying to help"" him.
Sally Field is just adorable in this very touching, funny, and sweet show. I recommend it for anyone who likes a heartwarming funny show but doesn't like sappy stuff. Great for kids or adults!!

I bought the Gidget Movie Collection, then the book by Frederick Kohner, who based the lead character on his own daughter, Kathy. Now I've proudly added the TV series to my nostalgia roster. While I still love the original Sandra Dee vehicle, this television show featuring a young Sally Field is entertaining and fun in its own right. Don Porter, who portrayed the Gidge's dad in ""Gidget Goes To Rome"" (1963) reprises his role here, sans wife, since Professor Russ Lawrence is apparently widowed. The series also introduces Gidget's elder sister Anne (Betty Conner), newly married to John Cooper (Pete Duel), and Lynette Winter (who looked so familiar, and then I realized she was from another 60s movie favorite, ""The Parent Trap"") is her best friend Larue. Francie Lawrence, aka Gidget, is a teen who loves surfing and runs to the Malibu beach whenever she can. She faces the now classic adolescent predicaments, laced with sweet family humor. Great 60s kitsch and what a trip down memory lane (not that I would know, it was all before my time, lol), with familiar faces like Barbara Hershey and Richard Dreyfuss. Too bad the show only lasted one season, but at least the complete series is preserved so wonderfully on four discs.

The series and the films are the perfect way to pass the time and indulge in some swinging fun on a rainy afternoon.

By then it was the late 60's and many of my peers were watching Dark Shadows or looking for something more revelent.  I loved Gidget!  A teen age girl with a doting dad, who seemed to be trying to find her place in her world.  Of course there were the usual cast of supporting players, the best friend, the meddeling sister and brother in law as well as various teachers, boyfriends and others.  Gidget was sure to fall in love and then somehow manage to make a mess of things, only to eventually work it out and make amends, make up with steady boyfriens Jeff, realize it's best to just tell the truth and learn it's best to just be yourself. Sure the plots were simplistic and each dilema solved neatly in the half hour time slot.  And, it was a way of life that only existed in the scriptwriter's mind, though it drew from the novel ""Gidget"" written by the real Gidget's dad, Frederick Kohner. What drew me to these shows each day was the genuine affection between Gidget(Sally Fields)and her father (Don Porter)and even her sister and brother in law.  No matter what happened, there was an underlying message of tolerence and it was best to just yourself.  Simplistic?  Sure.  The complete collection of Gidget also allows glimpses of stars we know today including the  earliest dance moves by Toni Basil. There are also extras including Sally Fields telling about her break and becomming Gidget.

The show is just as entertaining, if not more, as an adult (you catch a lot more stuff such as Gidget's busty friend ""Eleanor Chest"" who the boys call ""Treasure"").  Everyone of all ages and sexes (my husband will even sit through and watch them with me) will adore Gidget.

Anyway, I own it now and would highly recommend it to not only other fans of Sally Field, but to anyone who is interested in viewing a really fun example of what teens and life could be like in the 1960's!  The words which best describe Sally as ""Gidget"" are adorable and charming and funny - in the best sense ever!  She and her ""Dad"" are so sweet together.

Sally portrayed this lovable teen with tremendous heart and soul, but her impishness and fun-loving personality shone through in every episode.

The series only lasted one season because its appeal never broadened past the teen audience - also, the teen world was changing rapidly in 1965-66.

2487761,4,B000E3L7DM,"The 1965 ABC-Screen Gems sitcom of GIDGET, based on the the adventures of author Frederick Kohner's real-life daughter (which had already formed the basis for the 1959 Sandra Dee movie ""Gidget"" and a slew of sequels).  It launched the career of promising up-and-coming actress Sally Field, whose heroine became the quintessential picture of 1960s wholesomeness and girl-next-door charm.

Frances Lawrence, known as Gidget to her family and friends, spends every spare moment on the beach at Malibu where she surfs and enjoys harebrained adventures, though her married sister Anne loves to interfere with Gidget's plans.  GIDGET suffered from poor ratings and only lasted for one full season before being shelved, though the show did generate some interest during summer re-runs.  However, a second season could not be filmed due to Sally Field having been all but signed to do ""The Flying Nun"", and GIDGET was axed altogether.

The series remains pleasant and enjoyable viewing with fine performances from the entire cast, particularly Don Porter (""Private Secretary"") as Gidget's widowed father Russ and Lynette Winter (""The Parent Trap"") as Gidget's shy best friend Larue.  Sally Field, in her first big starring vehicle, is perky, appealing and everything else we expect Gidget to be.  The rest of the cast includes Betty Conner, Pete Duel and Michael Nader.  Keep an eye out for several guest stars including Richard Dreyfuss, Bonnie Franklin, Barbara Hershey and Henry Jaglom.

Sony Pictures has released the entire series of GIDGET in this well-presented boxset, joining their other outstanding season-sets of ""Bewitched"", ""The Flying Nun"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"".

Extras include the rarely-seen original pilot episode as well as a brand-new retrospective interview with Sally Field.

2487762,5,B000E3L7DM,This is simply wonderful and the most fun you'll have watching a DVD!  Too bad there is no Season Two.  Sally Field is terrific and the show should have been given more of a chance. A delightful trip to the 60s!,1148169600,8,211,4.121951219512195
2487763,5,B000E3L7DM,"Yes, there was a time when TV shows didn't go into hiatus during the holiday season and didn't have reruns every other week. How many seasons of a 2005-06 network TV program would you have to put together to get 32 episodes?

But that's neither here nor there. What is here (and there) is this great box set of every episode of this classic TV series. ""Gidget"" was a great sitcom with a lovable cast, some great writing and a lousy time slot. Many shows went head to head against the almighty ""Beverly Hillbillies"" in the 1960s and all of them lost the battle. While ""Gidget"" was good enough to be rescheduled until an audience could be found, that didn't happen and within a year, Sally Field would be wearing a nun's habit on primetime instead of a bathing suit.

Nevertheless, if you like good wholesome classic comedy, you'll dig ""Gidget"". The picture and sound quality are top notch and there are some interesting extras too, such as an interview with Field about the show's production and the original pilot episode, which is an uncut version of episode 1. The scenes that were cut when the show went into syndication are restored in this version and the story makes more sense. It also contains the orginal version of the opening song performed by The Four Freshmen before someone at the studio deemed that Johnny Tillotson had more teen appeal.

Field and Don Porter are great together and the supporting cast is just as good: Betty Conner, Peter Duel (who would later tragically take his own life while starring in the hit show ""Alias Smith and Jones"") and the very funny and lovably adorable Lynette Winter who is the focus of the best episode of the whole bunch (where everyone gets the mistaken idea that Russ and LaRue are secretly dating).

Yes, Gidget was cute as could be but I've always been a LaRue man. Now I can get my LaRue fix anytime I need it.",1147910400,11,1867,4.564179104477612

2487765,5,B000E3L7DM,"Except for the few episodes available on VHS, I hadn't seen the Gidget TV series since it first aired in 1965. I expected the DVD box set to be light, enjoyable, though not particularly classic family sitcom fare. I was pleasantly surprised. Many of the '60s TV shows I dug as a kid just don't hold up well in the 21st century. Gidget does.

Who would have anticipated the high quality of writing and acting from a comedy that lasted a mere 32 episodes? It's likely Gidget was cancelled due to the late-'60s trend toward Hippies, drugs, love-ins, and all the other psychedelic trappings that were anti-everything Gidget stood for.

Well the hippies are gone, and Jimi Hendrix was wrong. It IS cool to love surf music again. Long live Gidget!",1143417600,10,741,4.648854961832061
2487766,5,B000E3L7DM,"Most people looking at this product already agree that Gidget is a great, charming TV show with a wonderful cast, so there's no need to convince you on that point.  I will say, however, that this DVD release is fantastic.  I've been waiting years for Gidget to come out on DVD, and I was not disappointed.

Gidget - The Complete Series fits all 32 episodes in one box set -- four DVDs that come in two stylish, slim DVD cases.  The episodes look good (remastered in High Definition) and sound great.  The colors on the box are cute and attractive; they'll look good on anyone's shelf.  I wish that there were more extras, but it does feature the original pilot and an exclusive interview with Sally Field, and everything else was so nice that I wouldn't think of taking off a star.",1143072000,57,781,4.464788732394366

I had never seen this show before, but it looked cute and the price was so good, so I gave it a try. Yeah, it's a brainless, silly show, but in today's world we need more of this. Great escapist comedy from a simpler time. Definitely recommended.

Some reviews said the quality of the discs was not good. I don't understand this, unless different releases of this product were made. I came here to write a review specifically because I was so impressed with the quality (which exceeded all expectations for the budget price). The video is flawless and almost looks like high-def.",1520985600,,630,4.566371681415929
