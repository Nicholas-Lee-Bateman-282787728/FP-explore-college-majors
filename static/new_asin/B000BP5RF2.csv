8090560,2,B000BP5RF2,The visual quality of DVD is not sharp. Cosell makes some pretty lame commentary and asks some obvious questions of Hornung. They review some clips from both the Packers and Notre Dame.  Way too short and only vaguely entertaining.,1309564800,,231,4.923076923076923
8090561,5,B000BP5RF2,An excellent vendor that I would highly recommend to everyone.  The vendor stood by their product and I wouldn't hesitate ordering from them again.  The Paul Hornung DVD meant a great deal to me as I grew up watching the Packers with my father.  I wanted to get it right and the vendor wouldn't rest until I did.,1290988800,,312,4.344827586206897
