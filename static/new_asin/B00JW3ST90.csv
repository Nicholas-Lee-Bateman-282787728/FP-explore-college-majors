6395345,5,B00JW3ST90,"Gabriel Byrne is fascinating in this thriller. He
just keeps getting better as he ages.",1408320000,4,87,4.866666666666666
6395346,5,B00JW3ST90,"Interestingly, novelist Chris Mullin's novel A Very British Coup, written in 1982, was adapted for television in 1988 and set in the very near future (1991-92). The miniseries won a number of awards and is still highly regarded today. SECRET STATE, a new miniseries from 2012, describes itself as being ""inspired by"" Mullin's original novel. Instead of being a remake of A Very British Coup, SECRET STATE takes its basic theme of political corruption and updates it. Political corruption and its relationship with big business and the military is not a new idea. Why then, is any reference made to the novel which isn't really a source novel? Is this ""name dropping"" for the sake of piquing interest in the new series? Twenty years is a long time in television years, so there is arguably little value in referencing the previous series and the novel upon which it is based.

All this to say, in this reviewer's opinion, SECRET STATE stands on its own as an excellent political thriller in the vein of Seven Days In May, if one insists on referencing previous films that address corruption at its highest level.

But again, there really is no need to reference. With a powerhouse cast led by the always simmering Gabriel Byrne and the never-quite-sure-what-he's-up-to Charles Dance, SECRET STATE is highly watchable from its opening scene of destruction to its closing shot of the same destruction serving as a metaphor for a much greater political and moral destruction.

The script is top notch and the actors bite into it with relish. Layers of plot development fall naturally into place and the introduction of characters evolves at a pace that is beautifully calculated to leave the viewer going ""oh, now who's this?"" With a wheel of dramatis personae so rich in variety, it requires a particularly strong presence at the hub and that is precisely what Gabriel Byrne provides. Seemingly physically large to begin with, (though he's only 5'10"") with an eagle-like nose that bespeaks dignity and strength in stillness, Byrne stays atop of the heap of people vying for our attention and sympathy. This is one of the true mysteries of the motion picture/television industry and one that is so readily taken for granted. It is the mystery of Star Power. You either have it or you don't. Byrne has it.

Apparently, Byrne hates being described as ""brooding and intense"". It is one of the great curiosities for actors who play parts so effectively that people impose upon them the characteristics of parts they have played. It's really the ultimate compliment but for some, like Byrne, who have achieved a certain level of international success, it becomes tiresome. Be that as it may, Byrne is the man at the centre of SECRET STATE and not just the physical centre. He's also the moral centre. This is where all political stories ultimately must venture, into the Arena of Morality. As an elected official--elected because people put their trust in you to do the right thing--making the right decisions is believed to be inherent to the position. And yet how well we know that power corrupts. Perhaps the question asked in SECRET STATE is: will Byrne's character succumb to this inevitable crumbling away of moral integrity?

There are certainly enough pressures. Whether it be shark-like political opponents like Rupert Graves or Sylvestra la Touzel, or a well-meaning but ultimately damaging journalist like Gina McKee, or a hard-nosed general like Nicholas Farrell, Byrne's Prime Minister is constantly under the gun. When asked at one point if he is having an affair with journalist McKee, he responds ""When would I have time?""

As events come to a head, Byrne delivers a speech in the House of Commons that is quite unlike anything ever heard before or since. It makes for a stunning, inevitable conclusion to a compelling series that will have you hanging on every word Byrne utters.",1406505600,18,3887,4.944869831546708
6395347,5,B00JW3ST90,"SECRET STATE.  This all-star British political thriller, a television series, received its premier on DirecTV in November 2013.  A major industrial accident kills 19 people in Teesside, the north of England.  Deputy Prime Minister Tom Dawkins (Golden Globe winner Gabriel Byrne, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, IN TREATMENT) is tasked with investigating the accident and seeking justice for the victims' families. As the contemporary production explores the relationship between a democratically elected government, big business and the banks, Dawkins  takes on a giant American petrochemical corporation; eventually his own government, to uncover the truth. This contemporary boasts a strong supporting cast including Charles Dance (GAME OF THRONES) as reptilian chief whip of the party, John Hodder; Rupert Graves (SHERLOCK) as Dawkins' colleague/competitor, Felix Durrell, a smooth politican and Chancellor of the Exchequer; and Gina McKee (THE FORSYTE SAGA, NOTTING HILL,THE BORGIAS) as Ellis Kane, a tough questing journalist. The series was written by former British journalist Chris Mullin, based on his own novel A VERY BRITISH COUP.  The box set consists of four episodes on two discs, running approximately three hours, plus bonus programming, including features on the British House of Commons, Biggin Hill Airfield, Number 10 Downing Street, and Chris Mullin.  The entertainment is not rated, but there is some coarse language. There is also, thank goodness, and thank you RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles, for who would want to miss any of this quick paced witty dialog.  I received this as a review copy.

Byrne and Dance are two more fine examples of how well some British leading men are able to age into actors with sufficient presence and gravitas as to be able to carry a picture, any picture.  Their two-handed exchanges here are arresting.  Other well-known faces in the cast include Tony  winner Stephen Dillane (THE HOURS) as Paul J. Clark, chief of the chemical company; Nicholas Ferrell as General Munnery; Anton Lesser as banker Sir Michael Rix and Sylvestra Le Touzel as Ros Yelland, Secretary of State, another of Dawkins' colleagues/competitors.  The episodes are:

Disc 1

Episode 1
On top of the huge deadly explosion in Teesside, the Prime Minister's plane shockingly goes missing, Deputy Prime Minister  Dawkins is left to pick up the pieces amidst the growing public scandal. While he is dealing with the crisis, Dawkins is pressured by Chief Whip Hodder to run for  Prime Minister.

Episode 2
After a bruising three-way struggle for the job,  newly elected  Prime Minister Dawkins vows to uncover the truth behind the explosion, to bring justice to its victims and to push for an explanation of the former Prime Minister's plane crash. Meanwhile, MI 6 employee Agnes Evans decides to circumvent her coworkers when they discount her alternate explanation for the former PM's plane crash.

Disc 2

Episode 3
Amidst the threat of nationwide chaos and impending war, Tom gives the Texas-based petrochemical company that is responsible for the Northern England accident, and owned the plane on which the PM died, an ultimatum by freezing their assets. Meanwhile unseemly details of Tom's military past are brought to light by journalist Ellis Kane.

Episode 4
His colleagues become aware of his past: Tom must consider the best way to address the matter in public. Matters become even more complicated as more details about the plane crash emerge. While its government contemplates what actions to take, the country waits on Dawkins.

Never read the underlying Mullins novel, but  have watched and reviewed the 1988 A VERY BRITISH COUP, its previous television treatment: this review may be found on its website.  I admired a towering performance by Ray McAnally, one of his last, but the production repeatedly put me to sleep.  You might say  it was dull. Be that as it may, it can be considered the progenitor of the HOUSE OF CARDS trilogy, currently successful in two iterations.  It must also be considered the direct progenitor of Sally Wainwright's unfortunately meretricious 2006 fantasy, THE AMAZING MRS. PRITCHARD.

However, dull is the last word  I'd use to describe this newly imagined series, SECRET STATE, that actually seems to end where the original began.  Mind you, I have a pet peeve against novels or scripts that rely on malfeasance in high government, or Texas-based petrochemical companies as villains; yet I found SECRET STATE extremely evocative, topical taut and gripping.  In this house, we were hooked from the first minutes of the show, and binge-watched all four episodes at a sitting.",1405641600,12,4634,5.2540760869565215
6395348,5,B00JW3ST90,"Captivating! So realistic you forget it is adapted fiction. Based on Chris Mullin's ""A Very British Coup"" -1982. Adapted earlier [1988] but this mini-series is arguably the more contemporary relevant. Superb script. Although being high-suspense; it is also a masterpiece in character study of elite politicians. It just FEELS true. Resultant of the fine character performances by UK stars. Global big business, tragedy, and politics collide--but that's like today's headlines. This story begins with a tragic local industrial accident and climaxes with potential international war. It's a three hour spellbinder (in 4 parts and nominated for an Int. Emmy) that you'll want to watch straight through. And then watch again. Even my wife was eager for a second viewing.

Cast highlights: Gabriel Byrne (Best Actor nominee) as interim PM. Ralph Ineson (Game of Thrones, Titanic, Harry Potter) as PM bodyguard. Charles Dance (Bleak House) PM's helpful Chief Whip. Gina McKee (Forsyte Saga) journalist. Sylvestra Le Touzel and Rupert Graves (Garrow's Law) cabinet secretaries. Douglas Hodge as PM's past friend. Anna Madeley (Mr Selfridge) as press sec. Ruth Negga an MI-5 bug listener nominated for Supporting Actress award. Plus!

SDH SUBTITLES for feature and bonus.

3===Impending war with Iran and Dawkins makes a bold move against PetroFEx. The resultant backfire and situation spirals out of control.
4===Dawkins; military secret is exposed. Iranians are poised for retaliation. Dawkins must make a decision and take action. A gripping finale.",1403827200,12,1982,5.537953795379538
6395349,5,B00JW3ST90,"Is as handsome as ever. Also, Charles Dance is hot and a very commanding actor. I'm on the prowl for pictures with Charles. I did not realize this storyline was a lead up to the Brits going to war in Iraq.",1401580800,4,205,4.024390243902439
6395350,5,B00JW3ST90,"Great story, excellent actors and very tight direction. Possible only to watch one episode at a time, to take in all detail. Great intrigue throughout. Just the sort of viewing I love.",1388102400,5,184,4.78125
6395351,5,B00JW3ST90,"A well crafted, taught political thriller.  Much more the thriller than its predecessor ""A very British Coup"", which I liked a lot for its own reasons. Also the story lines are quite different, though coming from the same book by Muller.  Here we have
Gabriel Byrne as the PM, a total opposite character (brooding and mistrustful) to the protagonist in A very British Coup ( outgoing and much too trusting).  Byrne has been a favorite since he was in Millers Crossing, that top notch offering from the Coen bros.
This time around the situations are so that one hopes that kind of thing really does not go on in government, but they are presented so convincingly that it is scary.  Here in the US there have been warnings about secret cadres of corporations that have great control over politics. Control without election.",1435881600,,821,4.76056338028169
6395352,3,B00JW3ST90,Enjoyable politacal thriller set mostly in England. I have always enjoyed Gabriel Bryne and he did a great job in this extended work. Cleverly done.,1432339200,,148,4.96
6395353,3,B00JW3ST90,Pretty good until its ending. That was baffling to all three of us. It even seemed like something from another film.,1431561600,,116,4.571428571428571
6395354,4,B00JW3ST90,"If you want an actor to play a man who seems to have the weight of the world on his shoulders, then Gabriel Byrne is your man.  He can look weary without looking hangdog, and he can win your sympathy through sheer doggedness.  So he's the man to play Tom Dawkins, the Deputy Prime Minister of the UK who is thrust into the top job when the PM's plane goes down, under mysterious circumstances, as he returns from a visit to the USA.  The plane that goes down is a jet owned by Petrofex, a multi-national energy company whose north-of-England plant has been the site of a chemical explosion that killed about a score of people and wounded many more.  The government -- Tom's party -- had negotiated the deal that brought Petrofex to England, and it now seems that one reason was that safety standards there were considerably less tight than they would have been in the US.  Accountability is called for, and suddenly, Tom is the man who has to deliver it.  Two members of his party and his cabinet who covet the top job -- Felix Durrell (Rupert Graves) and Ros Yelland (Sylvestra La Touzel) -- can hardly wait to see him stumble.  Tom is that kind of politician that the movies can't do without -- a man of integrity who cares more about ""the people"" than about his career and who, as a result, comes across as idealistically naive to his political opponents and as attractive to us viewers.

I'm going to avoid spoilers here, so I'll just say that Tom learns just how closely the intelligence divisions of his government, MI5 and MI6, while not exactly at ease with one another, are nonetheless complicit with the Defense chiefs, ""big business,"" and the banks, and that they all have interests that are not really Tom's.  The result is that Tom's enquiries into both the chemical explosion and the plane crash are hampered by these competing interests, and the interest of the story is how Tom tries to find a way to be accountable and honest.  The action takes place around 2012, so the financial crisis has occurred, and it turns out that as a result Tom has a bit more leverage than he thought he did . . .

Tom isn't exactly the last honest man -- there's a dogged newspaper reporter called Ellis Kane (Gina McKee), the troubled intelligence gatherer Agnes Evans (Ruth Negga), the alcoholic ex-intelligence agent Tony Fossett (Douglas Hodge), and none of them like what's going on and, unknown to one another, try to share important information with Tom.  It seems remarkably easy in the age of the cell phone for private citizens to get in touch with the PM!!  The more dubious characters include excellent actors like Stephen Dillane as the CEO of Petrofex,  Anton Lesser as the CEO of the Royal Caledonian Bank, and Nicholas Farrell as a Defense chief.  And the great Charles Dance, in full mellifluous voice, is John Hodder, the Chief Whip, who is clearly sympathetic to Tom and who admires him but who, at the end of the day, wants to be sure that his party doesn't lose hold of power.  As things develop and the prospect of Middle East military confrontation looms, Tom's position in his own party becomes less secure.  Tom's efforts to bring about the circumstances that he believes best for the country are ingeniously contrived, but will they work?

The four episodes take 180 minutes.  I wouldn't have minded a bit more expansion in the direction of ""State of Play,"" for the characters are interesting enough to warrant it.  However, the relative brevity keeps the action tight and the suspense ramped up, though American viewers unfamiliar with the British Parliamentary system might find themselves a bit unsure of elements in the ending.  Still -- much to enjoy.  The performances are very good and the atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion is very well maintained.",1430697600,,3781,4.688350983358547

8654148,1,B00JW3ST90,"If you have masochistic tendencies then I highly recommend you invest three hours of your time suffering through this film. You will not be disappointed. If on the other hand you require top-notch acting and superb dialogue, all wrapped around a fresh and exciting central theme, then I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere....anywhere. I rented this movie for two reasons; Gabriel Byrne and Charles Dance. Byrne plays the part of England's Prime Minister and while I have enjoyed seeing him in other films, in this one he was unbelievably weak. He forever has great difficulty making decisions, in large part because he surrounds himself with untrustworthy types who all appear to have their own either hidden or self-centered agendas. Throughout the film you find yourself absolutely frustrated by his utter impotence when confronting members of Parliament, journalists, friends, and especially his aides and advisors. He fires a general but the general shows up for a meeting anyway. He tells the head of a bank to freeze the funds in an account, the banker transfers them. Throughout the film Byrne, when faced with making decisions, mopes around, struggling for answers, and is repeatedly, in bathrooms and boardrooms reminded that the decision-making is part of the job. Repeatedly he is ""mothered"" by political subordinates and told in so many words that he needs to put his big-boy pants on and do the job he was elected to do. All of the blame cannot be placed on Byrne, he was the victim of screen-writing that was high-schoolish at best. The dialogue was simply horrible. And since when, in this day and age, are drunks allowed to just walk up to the head of a country un-challenged...because it happens in this film multiple times. At one point Byrne, as the Prime Minister, goes into a crowded saloon to meet with a friend, who turns out to be drunk. Yes, there were bodyguards also in the saloon, but off away from the table where Byrne was seated. And then there was the scene where Byrne discovers his closest aide has been secretly meeting with Byrne's political opponent and feeding her information. And what's Byrne's solution?....he tells the aide to call the opponent and tell her that he will not be able to meet with her any more. Basically he tells the aide that you have been disloyal and untrustworthy but as long as you promise not to do it again we'll just forget all about it. Baloney. No way that would happen in real life. That aide would be fired on the spot. The whole movie was filled with these sorts of idiotic scenes that just did not make sense or were completely inconsistent with what you would expect to be proper protocol, especially the many scenes involving security. As for Mr. Dance, he is always terrific even though his strong area is playing the villainous type. He's got the look, the voice, and he's just great...although in this film he has one of the more minor roles. You see him throughout the film but he rarely has more than a couple of lines each time. At one point I thought that perhaps he might have been a better choice to play rhe Prime Minister but that would never have worked.
Mr. Dance generally plays roles with a strong presence which would have been in great contrast to the Prime Minister in this film. Anyway, that's my take on it. Absolutely amazing to me that the majority  of reviewers have praised the film. For me, I thought it would never end.",1473552000,,3428,4.742043551088777
