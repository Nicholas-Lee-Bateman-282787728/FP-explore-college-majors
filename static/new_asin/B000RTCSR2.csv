8202495,3,B000RTCSR2,A glorified home movie. Worth watching once if you're a political junkie but that's it.,1482364800,,87,4.866666666666666
8202496,3,B000RTCSR2,"""Swing State Ohio"" is a very low-budget but competent documentary about the 2004 presidential campaigns and election in Ohio. It was the close vote in Ohio that decided who won the presidency in 2004. ""Swing State Ohio"" consists of two young women from New York interviewing a variety of people in Ohio during the 2004 campaign, equipped with a shaky camera and cheap microphone. Their filmmaking is okay, but somewhat stiff, dry and uninspired. They lack the artistry and humor of Michael Moore's ""Roger & Me"". They do find some interesting characters, such as an old tobacco farmer. I would only recommend this documentary to people already interested in politics in Ohio.",1326758400,,674,5.026785714285714
8202497,5,B000RTCSR2,"I thought this video was informative, entertaining, and as a Democrat quite depressing.
If this is middle America, god help us.  That said, I highly recommend ""Swing State Ohio.""",1187827200,3,178,5.137931034482759
8202498,5,B000RTCSR2,"Fascinating and highly entertaining look at the canditates, advance teams and voters. This video makes the viewer feel like they are following the candidates and witnessing public and private moments. It would be impossible to fully understand the importance of Ohio without seeing this film.",1187049600,3,292,5.511111111111111
8202499,5,B000RTCSR2,"A well done insight into the American political system. Fair and balanced, it takes us through one of the key states in the last election. Interesting interviews with politicians from both sides add to an understanding of what happened in Ohio in 2004. Well worth the time to see this interesting documentary.",1186963200,4,309,4.961538461538462
