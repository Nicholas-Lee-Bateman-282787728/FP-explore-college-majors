5558133,5,B00B5A9FOG,I have fallen in love with all of these characters. I have discovered that the BBC is very very good at producing excellent series. I am very sorry that this one is at an end.,1362096000,8,175,4.0285714285714285
5558134,5,B00B5A9FOG,"Camelot basks in the halcyon days of a New Golden Age. Arthur has been king for 3 peaceful years, but now an expedition to the frozen lands of Ismere has lead to the disappearance of Gwaine, Percival & others, they have been captured by Morgana & Ruadan a fellow sorcerer but why? Arthur & Merlin must undertake a dangerous mission into the unknown to find out. Arthur & Merlin arrive in a village that has been attacked & a dying druid tells Merlin of 'Arthur's Bane' a battle where the young king will be slain. Morgana is trying to locate a mystical key sending her captives deep into the mines below the fortress she aims to find it at all costs. Arthur intends to travel through Queen Annis' lands in order not to be detected but is betrayed by Sefa - Guinevere's maid to her father Ruadan. Arthur & Merlin are trapped by Mordred, whom Merlin recognizes from the prophecy as being Arthur's killer. Merlin & Arthur are close to exhaustion, but are shown some kindness by Mordred but what is his motive? However Merlin & Arthur escape & get into the fortress via the mines & find that Gwaine after being attacked by his captors has been protected by a spirit called the Euchdag who is herself the Diamar, the 'Key' which Morgana is seeking. Mordred saves Arthur from Morgana's attempt to kill him & is rewarded with a Knighthood on returning to Camelot. Only one thing is now certain: The Great Trial for Albion has finally begun.

Arthur rescues an old woman accused of sorcery, as she lays dying she gives him a horn with which he can summon the dead, unable to resist temptation he seizes the chance to speak to the person he misses most, his father, but the spirit world is a dark & dangerous place. His father berates him for marrying a servant girl, knighting ordinary young men on merit & his lack of cruelty to instill fear into his subjects. Arthur does not realize he has released his father's poltergeist, Uther starts to wreak havoc in Camelot - injuring Percival & trying to kill Guinevere. When Gauis tells Arthur that only he can return his father to the spirit world, he & Merlin set out to find Uther, when Uther finds & tries to kill Merlin, Merlin tells him that there has been magic at the heart of Camelot for years & just as Uther is about to tell Arthur about Merlin, Arthur blows the horn to return his father to the spirit world. Princess Mithian arrives in Camelot asking Arthur to help rescue her father King Rodor who is hiding from Odin the man who killed Uther, but Rodor is actually Odin's prisoner & the elderly woman who travels with Mithian is Morgana in disguise who is controlling Mithian with an enchanted bangle. Mithian is able to tell Merlin about Morgana whilst they are traveling but it's too late & Merlin is knocked out by Morgana. The knights leave Gaius & Gwaine to look after Merlin, while they carry on to their impending doom. With Arthur & his knights now captives it falls to Merlin & Gwaine to rescue them & then for Merlin to encourage Arthur to make peace with Odin. In the inky depths of an ancient pool, three soothsayers cast a dark judgement upon the king of Camelot. Osgar gives Arthur a rune mark from the Disir telling him that he must allow magic or face the consequences. Arthur & his men go to the caves to seek out the Disir, when they attack Mordred is fatally wounded trying to protect Arthur, who begs for the life of Mordred only to be told that in return for his life Arthur must allow magic to return to Camelot & he himself must embrace the Old Religion. Advised by Merlin who knows about the prophecy of the Druid boy & his part in Arthur's death tells Arthur to refuse which he does, but when they return to Camelot there is an unwelcome surprize waiting for Merlin on the steps of the castle.

After visiting her father's grave with Elyan, Guinevere is captured by Morgana who then takes her to the Dark Tower which is haunted by ghostly visions & screams designed to send the prisoner mad. Arthur & his men set out to rescue her little knowing that one of them will not live to fight another day. When Guinevere returns to Camelot she seems to be a changed woman but why? Darkness steals into the very heart of Camelot as Morgana & her puppet queen hatch a sinister plan to murder the king. When Arthur is thrown from his horse his saddle has been tampered with & the stable hand Tyr is blamed & imprisoned, he tells Merlin that he knows who tampered with the saddle but they threatened to kill his mother if he talked. When he is found dead the following morning Arthur realizes he was wrong but his fate has already been sealed. Guinevere poisons Arthur's wine & there is little time for Merlin to save him, but Guinevere blames the poisoning on Merlin to divert suspicion from herself to ensure she will be made Queen in her own right after Arthur's death. Merlin has to escape from the cells to help the dying Arthur but can he get there in time.... In the dead of night a young druid boy seeks out Merlin begging him to go with him to his village to save his dying sister, Merlin leaves with Daegal but soon realizes he has made a terrible mistake, the boy has lead him into a trap laid by Morgana who poisons him leaving him to die a slow & painful death. Meanwhile Arthur is preparing to host the ruthless Sarrum of Amata hoping to form an alliance with him. Guinevere meets the Sarrum & makes a bargain with him, if he kills Arthur they could share power together, but the Sarrum has other ideas he plans to kill them both & take Camelot for himself. Daegal is guilt ridden & returns to the dying Merlin, after helping Merlin to recover the pair of them race back to Camelot to stop the assassination attempt. Merlin is more determined than ever to find out the cause of Guinevere's strange behavior. Guinevere meets Morgana in the dead of night, but unbeknown to them both they are being watched by Merlin & a disbelieving Arthur who now sees the reason for Guinevere's strange behavior. Emrys seeks out the Dochraid to find out how Morgana's spell can be broken, only to be told that the queen must enter the Cauldron of Arianrhod of her own will to have the spell broken. Arthur & Merlin drug Guinevere & head for the lake but are followed by a suspicious Mordred. When they reach the lake Merlin disappears but then reappears as the Dolma, asked by Arthur as to where Merlin is she replies 'Oh the gangly boy' saying she is holding him as surity, Arthur persuades Guinevere to enter the lake by getting her to remember their love for each other, the Dolma recites her incantations to lift the curse. A grateful Arthur can't thank her enough but the Dolma says all she wants in recognition is for Arthur to realize that magic can be used for good as well as evil, Mordred tells Merlin he knows the true identity of the Dolma but he will not tell Arthur.

Morgana captures Alator to make him say who Emrys is. Merlin meets a woman who tells him The Great Battle is nearing & if he values his King he must meet her at the Temple of Erui. Merlin tells Gaius about her, to protect him Gaius tells Arthur there is a sorceress working in Camelot & where to find her. Mordred leads a party to capture her while she is meeting Merlin, but the pair escape. Morgana finds a note on Alator sent by Finna & sets out to find her. Merlin follows marks left on trees by Finna but is found by Percival & is made to stay in camp but Mordred lets him slip away during the night, he goes to meet Finna but they are ambushed & Merlin is hit by an arrow, they make it to an Old Watch Tower but are followed by Morgana, Finna sends Merlin to the roof for safety & gives him a small box telling him it will help him in the dark days to come & Alator said not to trust the Druid boy, she asks Merlin to give her his sword & to protect Merlin's identity she sacrifices her life. Merlin who is near death calls Kilgharrah who takes him to safety & heals his wound. Merlin & Gaius open the box which reveals a dreadful prophecy that will take place on the Plains of Camlann. Mordred finds himself torn between loyalty & love, but doesn't realize the path he is about to take will define Camelot forever.... Mordred meets Kara a fellow Druid with whom he was once in love, she is injured & needs his help. Merlin finds out about Kara but agrees to keep Mordred's secret. When Arthur & Merlin find her in the cave she tries to kill Arthur & is sentenced to death, Mordred pleads for mercy for her but Arthur refuses. Mordred helps Kara escape but they are soon recaptured & thrown into the cells & Kara is executed. Mordred's powers become all consuming & he escapes from his cell, Merlin fears this will tip him over the edge & the prophecy of the Druid boy killing Arthur will finally come true, sure enough Mordred goes to Morgana & in his anger reveals the true identity of Emrys.

Morgana & Mordred are preparing for war to destroy Emrys, Arthur & Camelot once & for all. Morgana sends the Gean Canach to Camelot to rob Merlin of his powers. Merlin knows he cannot help Arthur without them so he tells him this time he cannot go into battle with him as he has another mission to fulfil, Arthur is amazed, just at the time he needs his friend the most he deserts him. Merlin knows that to regain his powers he must go to the Crystal Cave. So as Arthur leaves for Camlann, Merlin heads to the cave. Morgana finds out & follows him, when they get to the cave Morgana traps Merlin inside knocking him unconscious, when he wakes he sees an vision of his father who tells him not to give up hope. Merlin goes deeper into the cave, in one of the crystals he sees Morgana planning a surprize attack, & tells Arthur via a dream. The Crystal Cave restores his magic & he becomes more powerful than ever. Arthur tells his Knights the battle will help create the United Kingdoms. As the battle rages Arthur is heavily outnumbered, & it seems he is fighting a losing battle. When all seems lost a sorcerer suddenly appears & turns the battle in Arthur's favor, Arthur & Mordred duel, Mordred says 'You gave me no choice' as he wounds Arthur but Arthur has the strength to kill Mordred before passing out. When Arthur wakes Merlin is by his side & reveals it was him on the battlefield as the sorcerer, Arthur is hostile towards him, but advised by Gaius he allows Merlin to take him to the healing Lake of Avalon. On the journey Arthur comes to appreciate everything Merlin has ever done for him & sees him with a new found respect, even softening his attitude to magic. Morgana is pursuing them, thinking that at last her brother is dying she will now become the rightful Queen of Camelot, but Merlin has other ideas & kills her with Excalibur. Knowing that Arthur is dying Merlin calls Kilgharrah to take them to Avalon, but they are too late & Arthur dies in Merlin's arms. Kilgharrah tells Merlin that Arthur is the 'Once & Future King' & when Albion's needs are greatest he will rise again. Merlin sends Arthur's body to the island & returns Excalibur to the lake. The next time we see Emrys is in the present day as he passes the Lake of Avalon, Arthur's Eternal Resting place.

Will we ever need Arthur & Merlin again? Only time will tell.",1361664000,50,11199,4.389985556090515
5558135,3,B00B5A9FOG,"For casual fans of ""Merlin"", the fifth and final season may feel like a rousing send-off, with fine performances from its four leads, a host of returning characters, and a ""full circle"" quality to its finale that certainly doesn't pull any punches. For long-time fans that have gotten invested in the characters and storylines, it's an immensely frustrating experience, simply because said characters and storylines have been sacrificed for a tired old formula. With only two exceptions (Mordred and Queen Guinevere) there is nothing in this season - NOTHING - that the audience has not seen a million times before.

""Merlin"" began as a prequel, intending to explore the lives of Arthur, Merlin, Morgana and Guinevere before they became their famous legendary selves. Essentially, it was to Arthurian legend what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville/dp/B003L77GG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville</a>&nbsp;was to the Superman mythos. Yet by this point, the show is not a prequel anymore, but a retelling: Arthur is king, Guinevere is queen, Morgana is their enemy and the Knights of the Round Table have been established. The prequel aspect of the show is over, yet despite all this, nothing has changed for our main character.

The unique idea that these particular writers brought to the Arthurian source material is that Merlin has to keep his powers a secret due to a law banning magic throughout the kingdom, resulting in him protecting Arthur whilst pretending to be a lowly manservant. It worked well enough for the first two or so seasons, but by this point, it's been TEN in-show years since Merlin first came to Camelot, and Merlin is still not any closer to revealing his secret than he was at the very start of the show. The writers/producers' point-blank refusal to go ahead with this revelation and capitalize on all the character development and exciting new storylines that could have emerged from it is enough to make you tear your hair out in frustration.

As it is, every single episode has only three variations. 1. A good character is kidnapped or injured, requiring Arthur, Merlin and the knights to ride out and rescue them. 2. An assassin infiltrates Camelot and tries to kill Arthur. 3. Morgana comes up with an evil plan (invariably based on either #1 or #2) only to be thwarted by Merlin's magic. I defy anyone to name me an episode this season that does not fall under one of these three categories. The plots are all EXACTLY THE SAME, and the only thing that changes are which parts the characters play (for instance, this season the role of the ""traitor in our midst"" goes to a brainwashed Guinevere - the year before it was Agravaine, and before that, Morgana).

As well as being repetitive, the stagnant plots completely decimate any intelligence or momentum that these characters ever had. It's hard to see how somehow as foolish and oblivious as Arthur could ever be considered the greatest king of all time (especially since the show has spent the last five years demonstrating that it was Merlin - not Arthur - who was the real power behind the throne) or why we should consider Morgana any sort of dangerous adversary when her plans are so ridiculously convoluted and her motivation so obscure. Equally confusing is how Merlin is renowned as a great wizard. He spends a lot of his time saving Arthur's life and waiting on him hand-and-foot, but he does very little (virtually nothing in fact) to guide Arthur toward being a wise, just, tolerant king. In fact...

SPOILERS

...he ends up completely failing in what he initially set out to do. From the very start of this show it was stated repeatedly that several things were destined to happen: that Arthur would lift the ban on magic, that he would unite the kingdoms of Albion, and that he would rule over the Golden Age of Camelot with Merlin by his side as his wizardly advisor. Well...none of that ever happens. I repeat: IT NEVER HAPPENS. Arthur is killed by Mordred at the tender age of twenty-nine after reigning as king for only five short years, and without doing anything in that time that justifies his status as the Once and Future King. By the finale, all the prophecies, visions, symbols, and Arthurian references that promised Arthur and Merlin would build a better world together were summarily destroyed.

Frankly, it's bizarre. How could the writers actually forget about their own central premise? What exactly has Merlin been striving for all these years? What was the point of any of it? It's hard not to end this show thinking that Merlin didn't just waste ten years of his life doing menial labour for a man who never treated him with much respect for the sake of a destiny that never actually happened. Perhaps Merlin should have been focusing on Guinevere all this time, for if anyone is going to legalize magic, unite the realm and reign over a peaceful kingdom, it's her. (And as an added bonus, she doesn't throw heavy objects at the back of his head while calling him a worthless idiot).

As it is, Arthur *does* eventually find out that Merlin has magic - but by the time the confession is made, it's too late to do anything about it.

END SPOILERS

It's not all bad, I suppose. Even though the actors are clearly ready to move on to greener pastures, they're still charismatic and likable enough to make you care about their characters. The casting agent knows what he/she is doing, as the addition of Alexander Vhalos to the ensemble was a master-stroke, taking over from Asa Butterfield as a now-teenaged Mordred. An ambiguous figure who sends Merlin into a paranoid frenzy over his supposed destiny to kill Arthur, this blue-eyed youth keeps the audience wondering as to his true loyalties and what - if anything - could induce him to kill a king he is seemingly in awe of.

Several popular guest-stars return (Annis, Mithian, Balinor, Alator, Uther) for memorable reappearances, and though the other three leads (plus a now utterly superfluous Gaius) are caught in a state of never-ending inertia, Guinevere manages to step up in order to demonstrate how effective she is as Camelot's reigning Queen. The visual and technical aspects of the show (costuming, locations, set-design, special effects) are always beautifully rendered, and there are several highly emotional scenes, especially as the show begins to head toward its grand finale.

Still, it's difficult not to get depressed by the possibilities that were squandered. Just imagine if Arthur had discovered Merlin's powers back in season three. There could have been a period of disbelief and recrimination, perhaps even exile. They could have reconciled in a time of trouble, and finally worked openly together as king and wizard. Merlin could have taken his well-earned place at the Round Table. The difficult task of reintegrating magic into the kingdom could have begun, with Morgana attempting to sabotage their efforts by aligning herself with those either skeptical of Arthur's intentions or unwilling to submit to his rule. There could have been a better exploration of Morgana's reasons for turning on Camelot (for some inexplicable reason, her abrupt switch from a compassionate young woman to a one-dimensional evil witch happens entirely off-screen) and more of Guinevere displaying her common sense and political savviness in uniting the kingdoms. The backgrounds of the knights could have been explored (I'm still astonished that they never capitalized on the story of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gwaine-and-the-Loathly-Lady/dp/0744507804/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gwaine and the Loathly Lady</a>), Arthur could have discovered the truth about his mother's death, and there could have been a complex and sophisticated conflict between sympathetic villains and morally ambiguous heroes, each portrayed in varying degrees of grey.

Perhaps it still could have ended with tragedy - but at least we would have felt that Arthur and Merlin actually achieved something in their lifetimes instead of just treading water for ten years.",1361404800,178,8124,5.136157337367625
5558136,5,B00B5A9FOG,"As always, cons first.
1. They could have done with combining an enchanted Gwen episode in that particular arc.
2. There were some unanswered plotholes. The fisher king?
After that..
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The actors were perfect. I have never come across a TV show with such great actors. All of them, even the minor characters had chemistry. *spoilers. You have been warned*
1. The Reveal was perfect. Arthur (James) and Merlin (Morgan) did it so well. Words cannot express how great that scene was.
2. Most people were expecting to get out their keyboards and flame away at the new actor who played Mordred. However, from the minute he stepped out, nobody had a complaint. Just like everyone else he played a very complicated character to perfection and headed up the nailbiter episode of the season-5x11. That episode made us all want to strangle the closest cute thing in reach. We were too bust crying our way through 5x13 to do any nail biting in THAT episode.
3. The finale. C'mon guys, we knew it would end that way. ALL shows to do with Arthurian legend do, although a little more closure would be nice.
4. There were so many awesome moments.
""I don't need a sword""
dang. I mean, we got to see Merlin throw Uthers ghost through a wall. You know you were cheering.
5. 5x09. There are no words. THE DOLMA!!!! Kudos to the actors not laughing their heads off trying to film that.
6. Dragoon makes everything better.
Overall, just watch them. So good, but so sad. We get mad because we love it so much!",1361232000,19,1534,4.70631970260223
5558137,5,B00B5A9FOG,"Pretty awesome series. Although some may not be satisfied with the end of Merlin, overall I believe the fifth series to be the best of them all.",1360713600,8,144,4.37037037037037
5558138,3,B00B5A9FOG,"the review is about the fifth season of merlin - some potential spoilers but i'm not revealing any major story.

i watched this last season of merlin more out of habit than a true desire to see the show.  there are fewer lighter moments and the moments between arthur and merlin, for the most part, seemed more contrived than previous seasons.  the first few episodes were OK but not as great as previous seasons where i found myself looking forward to the next episode.  the middle of the season where the storyline shifted to gwen made the episodes more interesting.  the last two episodes of the series are really good and tie up the show.  however, the last 2-3 minutes of the last episode ruined the entire series.

5558145,5,B00B5A9FOG,"The series in all was wonderful! The acting of the main and supporting cast was great. I will always suggest Merlin if you like witty and funny  characters, action, and drama in your shows. Merlin as a show does it own thing and doesn't need to be compared to anything or other Arthurian legend shows. To be totally honest the only let down of the series is the ending, and if you are purchasing this set then you are at the end anyway. It's not horrible, but from how big and epic this season was, as it should be for a finale, it could have been better. Make your own judgment calls, but me personally I felt let down as a fan because it felt rushed. It could have been presented better, if maybe they added an extra episode. They could have done so many other things to finish the series the way it and the fans deserved. They do stay true to Arthurian legend with the end though, so you can't get mad about that. I mean Arthur has to die, it would be like watching Titanic and the boat not sinking. This season has the best twist and action scenes. My favorite episode is in this season. They definitely go all out in series 5. In all great series and this is and season 2 are a definite favorite!",1471478400,2,1201,4.199134199134199

5558184,1,B00B5A9FOG,"If you haven't started this series yet...run away. You will never get the wasted hours back. If I'd know how it ended before I began the series I would never have wasted my time. The actors portraying Arthur and Merlin are great and help compensate for the poor writing throughout the series. However season 5 is so bad that all involved should be ashamed. Possibly the most pitiful final season in television history. Spoilers follow. Much of the series appeal through the seasons is the question of when is Arthur finally going to find out his friend is the wizard. The writers milk this over and over. The viewer will find themselves thinking...surely it has to be this season..for season two...and again for season 3...4. But wait! Arthur doesn't find out until he's dying right at the end of the last episode. So the big reveal, that much of the series has been built around, is an historic flop. Even worse, the ""writers"" have Arthur die as a boyking, right after he becomes king and hasn't accomplished squat. There is no Camelot, no golden age, no accomplishments that would result in a king becoming a legend. The sum total of this Arthur's kingship might merit a footnote on some obscure text in the deepest depths of an abandoned monastery. Those thinking British TV series tend to be more cerebral and better written may find themselves pining for the most inane American sitcom after watching Merlin's season 5 debacle.",1415404800,10,1432,4.778225806451613

5558220,5,B00B5A9FOG,"When I got season 1 a few months ago, I said this was my new favorite series.  I have not been disappointed. The series is very well done - the acting, costumes, beautiful scenery (although some enhancement with CGI but you can't tell), wonderful music - everything about this series is high quality.
Season 5 Morgana still plotting revenge against King Arthur, and war against Camelot. Merlin faces his destiny, and we get closure between Morgana, Mordred, King Arthur, and Merlin. (Merlin isn't quite as ""chipper"" as he has been in the past - he's more serious, but as he tells Gaius, he ""grew up"" - and has a great destiny to follow.)  Lots of action, lots of magic.  My favorite scene is the VERY LAST ONE of the show. (That was worth the whole thing to me.)  I never get tired of watching this series.
There ARE English subtitles for the hearing impaired and some extras. I would highly recommend this series. My only disappointment is that each ""season"" is only 13 shows and it ends at season 5. It's a little pricey - I waited to buy until the price went down a little. I'm sorry the show didn't last more seasons (I want MORE).  Wonderful show.",1406332800,,1152,4.492822966507177

I never tire of stories of Arthur and Merlin and all the other characters of Camelot ...I usually do not like a stray from the original storyline...but this one is so so good!

5558249,5,B00B5A9FOG,"One of the best fantasy TV series of all time! The final episode made me want to get up and say ""please, please never let it end!"" It sticks with the classic tale about a young wizard in ancient England who befriends one of the greatest kings ever on Earth, Arthur. Magic spells, duels, and all sorts of toil and trouble including the fall of Camelot and the death of Arthur as well. I love it at the end when Merlin in modern times walks by Arthur's gravesite as a truck passes by. I know that is a spoiler but you will not care when you see it.

5558250,3,B00B5A9FOG,"I was a huge fan of this show during the early seasons, and I was sad to learn that it would be ending after the fifth season. The first few seasons would have earned four or five stars easily, but the last episode of the fifth season alone was barely deserving of one. There were way too many loose ends to tie up, and not enough time to do them all justice. Everything was jam packed into the last episode and it wasn't done very well. Everything that the series had been building towards, it failed to deliver on, and that is what really annoyed me about the ending. I felt cheated after investing so much time watching this show and getting an ending that didn't do the series justice. I'm just going to watch the first few seasons and pretend this one didn't happen, or at least the last episode.",1392940800,2,801,4.311258278145695

5558253,5,B00B5A9FOG,"Based on the number of negative reviews for the fifth season of Merlin, I almost did not purchase it. What a mistake that would have been! There were fresh ideas, the unexpected, and throughout the usual good acting and top rate productions. But if for no other reason, the final episode may have been the best in the entire series. For me it was certainly the most inspiring among many that have been a clarion call for loyalty, friendship, honor, and duty. The last one dramatically faced a key component of insight often missing in our daily affairs: Who am I really, and why am I here? Not the surface, but the core of these questions. And the interaction between Merlin and Arthur was the best and most touching of the series.

5558262,5,B00B5A9FOG,"I can clearly remember that day, not very long ago, when I logged onto Hulu and discovered something that made me ecstatic  there was a new episode sign right there by Merlin. I watched seasons 1-4 earlier this year, and have been desperate ever since to get my hands on season 5 somehow, but it never worked out. Then. Finally. Hulu got it. I was over the moon.

I watched it in a little over a week. And wow. I didn't realize how much I had missed it  the characters, the music, the setting, the humor, the drama, all of it. It was SO good to get to see 13 new-to-me episodes of what is basically my favorite show! It may indeed be my absolute favorite.

Anyway. So I watched it. If you know anything about Merlin, you know that the last two episodes of this last season go together, and everyone says they're sad  well, everyone is right. I sobbed. Literally sobbed. And I don't do that often, and Ive never done it over a TV show beforebut this one was worth it, and I love it despite crying. Definitely really worth watching.

Arthur and Gwen were finally happily married and that made me happy. Merlin was using magic as usual, and I still love Arthur and Merlin and the way they interact. Gwen was still a sweetheart, except when enchanted. Morgana is horrid  who would have guessed from season one that shed end up so horrible? Downright despicable. The knights are goodI miss Lancelot, but it is for the best that he is gone. Weve still got Gwaine. And Percival.

Lots of delightful mystery and intrigue throughout thisa grand culmination of everything for the endand the very last scene? Was a surprise. Even to me (and I tend to read spoilers about thingsI dislike being surprised with some stuff). But it made me smile. So! Need a new show? I highly recommend this one for anyone who enjoys things to do with dragons, magic, magicians, humor, romance, adventure, knights, suspense, war, epic battles, or even just anyone with time to watch the five seasons. If you are like me in most tastesyoull enjoy this.",1388275200,2,2020,4.5

5558277,3,B00B5A9FOG,"I loved this series, especially season 4. I was hoping that the final season would be its best. Sadly, that's not true. The writing has gotten stale. The plots are either outrageous or repetitive. The knights are men, but Arthur and Merlin still aren't. Arthur keeps talking about how he's such a great king, but he still seems like a man/boy grasping for maturity. Morgana is a joke. She does the same thing over and over and looks horrible. She's completely lacking in motivation and is nonsensical. The love story between Arthur and Guinevere is pretty much dead. There are some interesting pivot points surrounding magic, Mordred, and the story winding it's way around the legend. The look is even sleeker and more movie-like than before (slow-motion fight scenes and the like), but it doesn't hold my interest like it did before. It's still an entertaining show. Just not as much as before.",1379289600,,895,4.856209150326797

5558290,3,B00B5A9FOG,"I just want to talk about the dvd covers. Who designs them? This one is so awful to look at! The first 2 season covers were pretty decent, the 3rd one is horrible. The colors are too dark and flat. The torch looks extremely out of place. There's also a lot of empty space surrounding the cast. The 4th one looks very nice. It's my favorite because the cast looks fearless and the colors look wonderful. But this one...... it's right up there with season 3 dvd cover.

The ice landscape and sky is pleasant on the eyes, but Arthur's red cloak is way overbearing. There's just no balance with this strong color. I just see a red blob on the right of this picture. Gwen should have been facing Arthur's way. With both facing left, there's no harmony between them. The bottom half is what makes this cringe-worthy. Gwen is on this cover THREE times (Top, bottom, and as a tiny black shadowy figure just underneath the blade). Someone did a garbage job on Photoshop. The cut and paste of Morgana and Gwen... cannot unsee!!! Also, the whole Gwen being kidnapped by Morgana did not feel like a major part of this storyline. I don't understand why this is on the front cover. I would have much rather preferred the knights posing courageously under Excalibur. Morgana on her horse and disheveled Gwen would have looked better on the back.

 The complete fifth season should have said 'The final season'. Makes more sense, right? They just had to pick the ugliest way to say ""OOHH well looky here, it's a 5 disc set!!!"" Was that black smudge on the bottom right really necessary?

Lastly, Why do they keep putting ""The Adventures of Merlin""? Doesn't ""The Adventure of"" get dropped in the later seasons? Yes I know it was in the opening credits in the early seasons. But later on it's just left as Merlin. It was changed!

I want to give this one star but then my review was just about the DVD cover art, right? So I give the final season to what could have been an amazing epic conclusion to this wonderful series a three star rating because.... well you know why......I'm not going to repeat what many posters have already stated over and over. I respect Bradley and Colin's decision to not renew their contract for Merlin, but the writers completely screwed up the final season.",1377129600,,2271,4.54278728606357

I'm not going to give spoilers, but I'll just say this and you can check the reviews of 99% of the fans to back me up: The writers absolutely ruined the ending of the series.  It is so disappointing that many people are inconsolably sick about it.  If you watch Season 5 to its conclusion it will ruin the entire series for you too. Here's a good plan: just watch Season 4 and imagine how you like the story to end.  You will be MUCH, MUCH happier than if you watch it to the end.",1376784000,4,682,4.207692307692308

The series started with a warning of how it's going to end, the disappointment started there. The writers forgot all the promises they made in all the previous seasons: great destiny, united Albion, a great king, magic restored.

5558302,3,B00B5A9FOG,"This season is the finale of the Merlin series so I would definitely recommend that fans of the series see it. I would, however, also warn them of this: this season is often convoluted, contradictory, and humorless. This season lost most of the classic humor that made the earlier Merlin seasons so enjoyable. Quite frankly, it was rare to find a decent joke spaced less than 10 minutes apart from the other.

*SPOILER*
The entire plot of this series was tossed aside. King Authur was supposed to unite the lands and allow magic in Camelot. He did neither of these things (he made uneasy alliances with the other kingdoms, but the alliances were very frail- and that's putting it nicely- so I hardly consider that uniting the land).

So those are my main complaints with it. But it still does have many perks. It has phenomenal acting by most of its cast. Its music is excellent. And, well, it does complete the series (even if not as well as it could or should have).",1375142400,2,978,4.582857142857143

I've been watching Season 5 (The last season this program will be on, I believe); and am waiting for a great ending.  I will certainly be purchasing this last season soon.",1370649600,,252,4.704545454545454
5558350,3,B00B5A9FOG,"Don't get me wrong, I am as big of a Merlin fan as anyone out there. I loved the first three seasons, the character development, humor and plots were all top drawer. Then came Season Four:  Katie McGrath's transformation into dark Morgana was a bit unconvincing, then  we had the inevitable loss of Uther, admittedly needed for Arthur to become the king he needs to be.

Then came Season Five... I realize the Merlin takes a lot of artistic license with the Arthur legend, but: 1.  Camelot is barely touched upon. 2. The romance between Lancelot and Guinevere is barely even depicted, then Lancelot, Arthur's greatest knight, dies before he and Guinevere are even unfaithful.  3. No build-up of Excalibur as the sword of kings, it's not even talked about. 4. No search for the Holy Grail, or Galahad, for that matter. 5. No romance whatsoever between Arthur and Guinevere after all that build up for the first three seasons. A personal gripe is that Arthur never even becomes noble, he's still giving Merlin crap while he lays dying about not telling him he was a sorcerer even though it is obvious by this point that Merlin has saved him many times over.

I realize that the producers got told in December that they had to wrap things up quickly, but come on, its like there is a whole season, or two missing! This show does not exactly give one closure, which is a pity because it had so many original ideas in it at one point. I get the feeling that the creators had a different plan to end the show before this rushed one was put in the works. Perhaps one day we'll be allowed to see how they originally planned to marry the modern Merlin/Smallville elements with the more traditional Arthur mythos someday, but this ending leaves one feeling a bit cheated.",1370563200,,1761,4.574603174603174

I couldn't wait for a certain channel in the states to broadcast season five so I ordered the DVD. While the final season is good it lacks the carefree bantering and camaraderie done in seasons 1-4 and is much more serious. I won't divulge too much so I don't give away the plot or outcome but will say that it could have ended better than it did. I feel that it did a disservice to the fans and ended too abruptly but this is coming from a fan that did not want the series to end. The acting was spot on and well produced and was movie quality. I will remain a life-long fan of this group of newly discovered, fine actors. A very, very impressive series that will sit proudly and prominently in any collector's space.

One of the very appealing aspects of this series is that it is for families to enjoy: From ages 3 to 100+. You won't find swearing or raunchy sex scenes in this series.",1370304000,,1013,4.216494845360825

5558371,5,B00B5A9FOG,"I enjoyed this very much. I purchased each of the complete season sets as they came out. Since the retelling varied from the classic legend--in a good way--I came to it having no expectations of what changes there might be. In fact, I was looking forward to the changes. I especially enjoyed how the characters evolved: from prince to king, from servant to queen, from a loyal ward to her evilness, from 'apprentice' to powerful sorcerer. Even the dragon evolved from a captive full of rage to an aging benefactor. I found the stop-action rendering of the final sword fighting scenes very interesting. The lighting itself (dark scenes, light scenes) became a character in it's expression. No storyline is perfect but I find only one Major fault: Why didn't the ghost rat on Merlin?  Whatever faults other reviewers may have found may be the result of looking for the negative. Any fan of the sword and sorcery genre will be entertained and appreciative of this production. As a final note, I feel the need to mention the make-up. The make-up artists did a good job in making the dying and dead look dying and dead.

Although this story started out as a retelling prequel, it ended up faithful to the idea of the once and future king. That faithfulness, in itself, came as a wonderful surprise.",1370217600,,1309,4.732456140350878

5558400,3,B00B5A9FOG,"I was strongly eager to buy this dvd and I mean I don't regret buying it, it's just not everything I dreamed of.
First off, the cast seemed very distant. I know it is meant to be in the Dark Ages but the love between Guinevere and Arthur wasn't as magical as I had hoped. They seemed as though they did not like being near each other (of course I mean after they cured Guinevere of course). Even Merlin and Arthur seemed a little distant also. I realize Merlin wants to finally say who he really is but he seemed like he totally hated Arthur. As if he wanted to run away and never return. I was in love with their usual sarcasm with each other but this time, the sarcasm seemed almost as if it were real. I don't know, maybe that is just me.
Secondly, the storyline seemed very much rushed. I don't mind Arthur dying, but the way he went just didn't leave me feeling refreshed. Not all sad endings have to be depressed, some could feel hopeful. THERE WAS NO HOPE. He died, Guinevere became the ruler of Camelot and Merlin, who knows. I would have felt a little better with a little summary of what became of all the characters I love. It just felt so empty.

I could have just been thinking too much into this last season and ended up ruining it for myself. It is worth watching if you want to see the final season but if you like happy endings as much as I, do not watch!!",1369094400,,1373,4.161654135338346
5558401,4,B00B5A9FOG,"What can I say other than to agree with some of the other reviews I've read. I really enjoyed seasons 1-4, but feel that we lost a season somewhere?!?
SPOILER ALERTS
 I really didn't care much for the final 3 or 4 episodes of season 5, like I said it seems something is missing, there should have been a season where Merlin finally told Arthur about his magic and during that season it could have been based around Merlin learning more about his powers and abilities and Arthur finally realizing how much of a friend Merlin was to him and then going out to find him again, similar to when Gwen was banned, but returned once Arthur realized how much he loved her. Instead what we get is Arthur does not learn of Merlin's abilities until it's too late to appreciate them. Arthur only learns of them after he has been fatally wounded by Mordred. It seemed in this season that everything was rushed, things happened too quickly unlike the beginning where it set a decent pace.
Other than my complaints above, overall I enjoyed Merlin, it was a good show.
I do recommend it to others because you don't see many series' like this anymore, it would have been perfect if it would have had a different final season.",1369008000,,1206,4.4818181818181815

5558433,5,B00B5A9FOG,"To say I am a fan of the show is an understatement.  Hands down, it's the best show out there.  Unfortunately, it was the last of the 5 series that will be aired and to say I am disappointed is also an understatement.  So it is only natural that I would buy the last of the series on DVD.  Of course it goes well with my Merlin Series 1-4 DVDs.
This season is the best of the group.  All the episodes are exciting and leaves you wanting it to go longer than the scheduled times for that episode.  Each of the 13 episodes tie in all the loose ends from previous seasons and it is done well.
Although, I wanted to have Merlin reveal who he is to Arthur right from the get go in this series, it doesn't happen until later.  Too late if you ask me.  The first 2 episodes are action packed.  Episode 3 was terrific with Anthony Head coming back to this show.  Episode 4 and 10 brought back some previous actors/actresses. Episode 5, to me, was the turning point and fates were sealed.  It's one of my favorite episodes.  These fates will be shown in episodes 11-13.  The only sorta slow episodes were 6-9, but they tied in Morgana's/Gwen's parts according to the legend.  They are still great episodes.  The last three are where the real action comes in.  It completes the story line of the great legend of King Arthur and Camelot.  Note to oneself... store lots of Kleenex to use for the final episode.
The entire cast should be very proud of their accomplishments because each and everyone of them delivered their best this season.  Colin Morgan (Merlin) has set the bar for one of the best young actors, worldwide...IMHO.  To say he is anything less than brilliant would be gross misjudgment on anyone's part.  To prove my point, Colin earned the best actor award for 2013 beating out all other highly favorite British actors.  An accomplishment that was not suppose to happen...but did.  He has come so far and it is so good to see someone who deserves the best get the best acknowledgement.  Colin IS the main reason I watched Merlin for 5 years straight.  Bradley James (Arthur) was magnificent and without his presence, the show wouldn't have reached it's full potential.  Katie McGrath was perfect to play the part of Morgana.  She really portrayed the evil, high priestess well.  Richard Wilson (Gaius), never better as he was in this series.  So glad to see they kept him a constant in the 5 series.  The newcomer, Alexander Vlahos (Mordred), was perfect in his role.  He (to me) was the one character who was so vital in this series and Alex contributed so much to his part.  Very talented and not to mention he has such stunning blue eyes.
As I write this review, I realize that it should be on the product (DVD) itself, but for some reason, I feel it's more important to write about the series.  I will add that the DVD was shipped fast and I bought it at a good price ($29.99).  I definitely got my money's worth and then some.  There is no other show, TV or DVD I would rather watch.  I will continually watch Merlin, starting from Series 1, episode 1 all the way to Series 5, episode 13.  It never gets boring and re-watching it, I pick up more each time.  Classic legend with a relatively modern twist, makes this show the #1 show...ever (to me)!!
I will miss this show deeply and pray that the cast will come back at some point to make a movie or a TV show...even if it is for one night.  The cast and crew from England made one terrific legend into a five year brilliant TV show.  BBC, you outdid yourself and I am so glad I was able to enjoy Merlin each airing week.
Thank you Merlin cast, creators, producers, and all involved for making the last 5 years the best ever TV entertainment for this US citizen.

5558435,2,B00B5A9FOG,"I normally do not write reviews, although I purchase and watch a LOT of DVD - TV sets... but this was SUCH a DISAPPOINTMENT, I had to speak up. I wish I had stopped watching Merlin at the end of Season 4. That one was beautiful and actually ended quite well. But in this 5th season, it's like the writers did not know what to do with the story arc and went off the rails! Some episodes were TOO BIZARRE for belief!  I won't do spoilers.... just a warning: BEWARE: this is NOT the Merlin you got to know and love in seasons 1-4!

I would also note that the quality of the discs as they  played went down in my season 4 set, and worse in season 5, with odd ""scan lines"" across the faces of the actors if they moved more actively in mid range view scenes.

The writing is strong, the acting is phenomenal, the core cast have grown more into their roles and there's no turning back. This season is the darkest one yet and the stakes are even higher. Ending was not what I had anticipated but if you have been a Merlin fan since the beginning or are just starting out, you need to watch this final, epic season. Tagging along with these characters and seeing them to the end, while heartbreaking, is so fulfilling. The bond between Merlin and Arthur is as strong as ever this series, and it is because of that bond that Merlin has to make some of the hardest decisions he has ever made. My only complaint about this season is the torment and weight of Merlin's destiny weighs him down quite heavily in this season. To see Colin Morgan sad always breaks my heart!

Cannot tell you how much I adore Colin Morgan. He is truly a phenomenal actor. He brings so many layers to Merlin and provides you with so much emotion even with one look. He pulls you in! It is through Merlin this journey has been told and because of Colin Morgan that we fell in love with Merlin. Not only does he play Merlin, but he is able to play more than on character (i.e. Dragoon, and prepare yourself for one of his more hilarious characters to date) with such vitality and life! Katie McGrath is even more deliciously evil in this new series. To see her journey from the strong headed young woman from the 1st season to this bone chilling priestess who borders on the edge of madness is a true testament to Katie McGrath's genius. Bradley James plays Arthur with so much more drive this season, noble to the core you can see why Merlin would risk his life for Arthur. It's not beause of his destiny. It is because of his friend. Bradley James brings so much nuance and vulnerability to Arthur, yet under it all is steely resolve. It's little details that can be hard to miss, but he plays them so well you are truly caught up in the story. You believe in him. You believe in Arthur.

Break out the tissues folks, cause the end is nigh.",1368144000,3,2114,4.404092071611253
5558465,5,B00B5A9FOG,"As always, the cast, the photography, the visual effects and the writing of Merlin were fantastic!

However, I was sad to see the adventures end after its 4 or 5 year run.  It is sort of like becoming good friends with someone and they die or move away, never to see them again.  I shall miss all of them, but esp. I shall miss the wonderful rapore between Merlin and Arthur...they were perfect for the roles.  The ending is not too be missed...very moving last episode!!!

Thank you all for a wonderful adventure and a walk back in ""Time!""

If you've been following the series from the beginning, the last episode is very emotional. SPOILER: According to the legend Arthur is killed by Mordred. But Merlin doesn't tell Arthur he has majic until this last episode. The writers had many chances to let Arthur know in previous episodes. We never get to see Arthur rule with Merlin's majic at his side. They never show Arthur as the once and future king of Albion. Other than that the DVD is still a very good one. Colin Morgan won the National Television Award in England for best actor in a dramic series.  I had the privelege of meeting Colin last summer at San Diego Comic-Con 2012.

However, there are some actions scenes, which may be too  intense for the very youngest, but it is not at all the blood and gore that some shows feel they most have.

5558483,4,B00B5A9FOG,"The first thing I noticed was that in the opening dialogue Merlin is now a young man, not a young boy. When that change occurred I can't be certain. Not inappropriate considering Colin Morgan's 27 years old. He was a New Year's baby if you didn't know. Season 5 begins 3 years later. Uther is dead though his spirit is restless, and Arthur is King and married to Gweneviere. Morgana still haunts the shadows and Modred becomes a knight of Camelot. Arthur's Bane is Arthur himself sowing the seeds of his own downfall. Otherwise little seems to have changed. Merlin still lives in the room off Gaius' Lab, still wears the same clothes he was dressed in walking into Camelot, he's still Arthur's servant, and sorcery is still banned though with Modred on the scene more people are aware and able to practice it.

One of the strengths of the series and BBC Productions in general is the attention to detail as seen in the hazing that goes on when Modred sets out with the knights on his first mission--he is asked to ride seated backward on his saddle and subjected to other ignominities. Such extras add a sense of reality to a show that also features dragons and unicorns.

Morgana inhabits a dark tower not unlike those seen in Lord of the Rings though one suspects this one is CGI produced. This final season has a darker tone. Arthur is king so his carefree days are behind him though we see little of the tedious duties that must attend such a position. Plotlines centre around attempts to cause the king harm and Morgana appears at the centre of most. The relationship between Merlin and Arthur is still the central theme of the series.

Arthurian Legend has been reworked and re-imagined countless times in the last millennial. This series is yet another in the long line. The mythic bits are all in place though the round table looks rather cramped in Pierrefonds Throne Room. And as Excalibur is cast into the lake at Avalon the Lady's arm rises from the lake to grasp it and we bid farewell to Arthur and Merlin.",1367798400,,2020,4.574585635359116

The fact is, no two Camelot or Arthur movies/stories are the same.  Even the ""historians"" that first tried to write King Arthur in as a real person got many of the facts wrong.

The entire series however, and season five in particular kept the spirit of the stories alive and did so in a way that was not painful to watch.

The DVD however, do not have a whole lot in terms of any special features or such, and since it is the last season of the show, you would think there would be some more substance put into this part.",1367539200,,858,4.3105590062111805

Merlin has been a remarkable 5-season series; one that is rare:  meaningful and entertaining at the same time.

Having said this and consistently given the show a 5-star rating, I was troubled by the seemingly abrupt, empty ending of the series.  In each and every episode, we are introduced with ""In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy/man.""  At the end, however, we are kind of left wondering if all of this has been for nothing.  What has been accomplished?  What destiny has been fulfilled?  The foretold death of X by Y?  What happens now?  True, evil and evil sorcery have been greatly diminished, but...

On another note:  Does anyone else find it strange that every magician on the series seemed to know how to teleport themselves to another location except for Merlin?",1366848000,3,1046,4.75

5558546,1,B00B5A9FOG,"Here we have the typical Brittish series, starting off with great hope and light-heartedness, trending toward dark oblivion with a bleak fate long after you are sucked in.  The first two seasons were full of hope and positive outlook for the future, then increasing darkness from season three on.  All I can say is that the finale of season 5 was the antithisys of the beginning of the series, a typical depressing Brittish ""smash your hopes on the rocks"" ending.  My wife and I have followed this series with more enthusiasm than any we have seen in the past 10 years, replaying every episode of the first 4 season over and over, but watching the final episode less than an hour ago, have thrown the entire set of 5 seasons in the trash.

This is fiction and fantasy, and entertainment for the family(which this is billed as) should be uplifting and help us rise above the daily drone of real life.  Instead you chose to develop a great vision of a better world, a fair and just land where all people would be treated equally and with due respect....then smash that whole concept in the last 60 seconds of a 5 year series.  As you would say, BAD FORM!

I have several friends with young children watching and truly loving this series and am advising them NOT to let them watch season 5, it will break their hearts and truly depress them, and THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN!

I'm sure the writers, producers, and promoters are all laughing all the way to the bank for getting us to waste our hard earned money on this excellent waste of our emotional time.  I know that I for one will never again watch anything from BBC or produced in UK.  They may believe in negative fate, the futility of life, and that all good will eventually fail in this world, but I don't need their pessimistic crap shoved in my face.

The variations from the classic telling of this myth did not compromise the essence of each of the well-known characters.  There is much to ponder, ruminate and digest in this timeless story if you are looking for more than simply being entertained.

5558552,3,B00B5A9FOG,"Where can I begin with this review, other than how I wished the 5th season had been spectacular? Sadly, though, I felt it was far from it and was constantly reminded of how writers take the easy road in shows instead of choosing risky plots. Merlin: The Complete Fifth Season ought to have been a season of triumph, were Arthur defeats Morgana and reigns with his queen, Merlin can live as a wizard and adviser to the king, and Mordred can assume role as either ally or villain. Sadly, what I got was a season with three primary plot lines that repeated over and over and a very poor ending.

The truth is that what started out as clever and unique show quickly devolved into a drag, with boring and superfluous plots and characters. Sometime around season 3 I began to realize this, then felt more hopeful when season 4 was more concise and interesting. Sadly, season 5's main plots include either: a. someone being kidnapped by Morgana, b. a spy in Camelot who is sent by Morgana, or c. Morgana attempts to take over the castle and fails yet again. This theme was repeated over and over until I thought I had serious deja vu, the only unique aspect to this season was the introduction of an adult Mordred who lingered between being good and becoming evil (much like a guy named Anakin who became Darth Vader, who then decided in about five minutes and if you blinked you missed it). That was it. There was no time for Merlin to actually be a wizard adviser to Arthur, there was no time to enjoy the defeat of Morgana, it was all crammed into the last episode. And I had assumed Arthur would be different from his old arrogant 1st and 2nd season self and actually value Merlin for all that he had done for him and with him in season 4. But like with everything else, the writers couldn't be bothered to mature the king and instead went with the old abusive servant gagline stand-by.

While I will always love the character of Merlin, this season was a large disappointment, though not an unexpected one. I am relieved that the show is over, so perhaps Colin Morgan can find something with more substance for his acting career. He deserves it.",1365897600,21,2143,4.478260869565218

5558554,3,B00B5A9FOG,"After watching season 4 on Netflix, I cheated to watch season 5 as it aired in the UK, and then I watched the last episode more times than any normal mortal would be expected to--roughly 160--because I became hooked in a totally unexpected way, probably because of Colin Morgan's acting, although Bradley James is outstanding as well.  In fact, I bought the boxed set in part to pay back the BBC for all the times I watched that last episode for free.  The commentary I most wanted to listen to was the one for episode 13, and someone pointed out in a review that it's missing in the US version, so I  found it online and listened to it and that's when I understood.  Sure, I always found Merlin fun, even when the plots were repetitive and they ignored their own mythology when convenient.  But that last episode changed my life, and if that sounds dramatic, it's only partly so since I am agoraphobic and haven't been anywhere in roughly 32 years, yet I'm flying to the UK in May 2013 to see Colin Morgan act as Ariel at The Globe.  When I listened to the commentary, I realized that for the audience, it was important in a different way than it is for the people who made it.  For Katie McGrath, for example, it appears to have been just a job.  Maybe that's all it was for any of them--a job, a way to make a living. That's what came across in many of the commentaries.  So be glad that the BBC didn't give us that commentary. You can find anything that's missing on YouTube or illegally online somewhere.

Is that possible?",1365638400,3,349,3.7534246575342465
5558566,5,B00B5A9FOG,"First off a friendly warning:
Disc 3 only has 3 eps on it, though it's labeled Episodes 9-12. Do not worry. The last disc, 4, has the missing ep... the final two parter, though it is labeled Episode 13. Have no clue how this happened, but it's the only thing I had a problem with.
*SOME SPOILERS: BEWARE!*
The final series of Merlin, in my opinion, left very few questions to be answered, namely the fate of the younger dragon Aithsu. Did Merlin ever go back to Camelot after sending Arthur's body on its way? (Of course there's really no spoiler here, we all know how the legend ends, it's just 'how' it ended for this show that's the mystery, and I'll keep it as such, with the exception of saying keep a box of Kleenex or even a paper towel by your side. I should have used a paper towel. The Kleenex did little to absorb all the tears I shed. Colin and Bradley's performances in their final scenes was what defines the word 'Bromance'. This relationship, above all others in the story line, was the central focus and remained so until the very end. Be prepared. If you are wrapped up in this series, you WILL sob your eyes out.)
I have not been so involved in a television show in a very, VERY long time. It was the Bromance that drew me in and kept me riveted. As the producers/creators said, ""It is a love story"", but obviously between two clearly straight men. Merlin's love for Arthur is incredibly profound, Arthur's changing from a king who will not listen to his servant into a king that finally does, is as beautiful and breathtaking as the final battle scene when the sorcerer Dragoon makes his appearance. (For those who do not know who Dragoon is, watch the series from start to finish. Trust me, Colin has fun with this version of himself and it's quite evident. ;D)
I am very sorry there will be no more of this story-line, but all good legends must come to an end, and sometimes it's as gut-wrenching an ending as it is satisfying (clue here: any show that brings me to a sobbing point is worthy of the 5 star rating I give it).
Others who complain about the ending I know are only doing so because of the sorrow it caused. Others who have dissected this series and offered their complaints have missed certain elements within the plotting. I had the advantage of watching the series from start to finish within the span of 2 months, not five years, so I was able to keep fresh all the former hints and clues that were given to us. Watch it again straight through and you'll see what I mean.
My only two complaints with the writing and acting was 1) Katie's bad habit of dropping her last syllables during her dialogues. Her acting was superb aside from that, but it was that little annoyance that, from the beginning,kept niggling at me and continued to do so throughout the series. Also her inability to maintain the British accent. She fell into and out of it more times than I would bother to count. Other than her speech/vocal mishaps, she played a fantastic Morgana. Her expressions were spot on, her sense of betrayal, even her compassion for Aithsu was compelling. Just wish she'd had a vocal coach to keep her on track.
And 2) Gaius's constant pulling his knowledge of 'the Old Religion' out of his hat, as though he were a walking encyclopedia of all things mystical, and his constant refusal to accept Merlin's misgivings at his word. After 10 years of being at the boy's side, and having Merlin's 'funny feelings and suspicions' constantly verified, Gaius still cannot seem to grasp it that Merlin may just know what he's talking about. Arthur's (supposed) inability to do that is understandable... he has no idea Merlin is a sorcerer(Or does he??? see my view on this below), and looks upon him as just a servant. But Gaius? However, that being said, I love the character dearly as when he finally sees Merlin has grown up, he comes across as a father figure who doesn't want to see that happen. Those two things were my only complaints with the series. As for Arthur's being oblivious to Merlin's sorcery, I choose to believe on the side of 'plausible deniability'. He 'knows' Merlin is special, hence his constant need to keep his servant at his side, but if he allows himself to believe that Merlin is of magic he would be forced to deal with him. Yes, in the final magic reveal he shuns Merlin, but only for a while as he tries to wrap his head around the fact. Of course, this is all supposition on my part, nothing to really base it on fact, but I've been a victim of denial myself, so I keep wondering, does Arthur suspect anything at all about Merlin and is he just going into severe denial about it? It's possible. Then again, I'm a hopeless 'bromantic' and never want to see the boys at odds to the point of ripping their relationship apart. So I choose to believe for the best. It's my nature, sue me. ;D
I will no doubt watch the entire series again and again. Bromances of this quality are hard to come by, and I seek them everywhere. This one delivered in spades!",1365638400,3,5008,4.4564270152505445
5558567,5,B00B5A9FOG,"Undoubtedly, Merlin is the best sci-fi series! Although I am still watching this fifth season each episodes by far exceeds my expectations. The performance by the actors and actresses, the location filming, the special effects...all contribute to make this a unique series. One becomes part of the drama and plot. I am at the middle of the season so far but if the rest is like what I have watched so far I am ""enchanted"".",1365638400,2,422,4.64

This show knows how far it intended on going and even though over the course of the show the ratings just got higher it still decided that they would finish on a high note. This is a show that is amazing from beginning to end so if you are reading through all of the other reviews trying to decide whether to buy it just buy the show, you will not be disappointed!",1365120000,4,517,4.078431372549019
5558569,5,B00B5A9FOG,"I have loved every season of Merlin & this one is no exception, you've got Arthur whose been King for 3 peaceful years with Guinevere along side him, Merlin who is always looking out for Arthur & Morgana who is her usual vengeful self. The arrival of Mordred as a grown man played by Alexander Vlahos has added even more depth to the series. This final season has had the usual mixture of drama & laughter but also a tinge of sadness that this to be the end of Merlin. I will miss him & all his adventures.

I wish they had had the big reveal early in the series or even at the end of the last one. I'm sure the plots could have been even more enthralling than they were with Merlin using his magic & Arthur knowing about it, & the pair of them trying to defeat Morgana once & for all. Having said that, this season has lived up to the usual high standards of the BBC.  Well done BBC.",1365120000,5,884,4.074712643678161
5558570,2,B00B5A9FOG,"I recently caught up on Merlin through Netflix and became pretty obsessed with the show. Luckily for me I was going to London over winter so I would be able to watch the fifth season as it played in the UK instead of having to wait in the states.

What I ended up seeing broke my heart. Merlin is a great show, especially the early seasons. This season though was not worth my time. As happy as I am that Gwen and Arthur tied the knot and are happy, I was very sad by the hurried way the producers decided to wrap up the THOUSANDS of loose ends that have come to pass as the show went on. First of all, Merlin should have revealed his magic to Arthur AGES ago. The fact that producers waited until the last possible minute for that to happen was horrible. There should have been more of a result. Arthur, although pigheaded and annoying at times, loves Merlin and he should have come out with it ages ago. The choices made by the writers and producers boggle my mind. I don't understand why they would choose to honor the original legend in some ways and then subvert them in other horrible ways.

The rushed conclusion was very sad to me as a loyal viewer. The way Mordred changed was horrifying but also predictable. I know the point is that we can't escape our fate but the problem is that Merlin could have and acted stupidly. So much of this was his fault that I could barely stomach the ending. I liked the perceived bit of hope at the end but it was so frustrating and I felt could have been wrapped up better.

I just wish that the ending had been more gratifying instead of hurried. There was no reason they needed to drag out everything to the very end. Also...there was no glorious Camelot. There were three years of fake peace. The promised ending that I wanted was not granted. I love the characters and will always treasure them and there were some parts I enjoyed of the last season but all in all the end is a disappointing and almost lame finish for characters I viewed as friends and smarter than they turned out to be.",1364947200,56,2037,4.299479166666667

5558572,5,B00B5A9FOG,This is a great show and the last season. I have all four of the others and watch them quite often. They are funny and very entertaining. I wish the show would go on for several more seasons but like all good things it must come to an end. This is a great season with a lot of fighting and really good special effects. If you are a true Merlin fan you must have it to complete your collection! Colin and Bradley are great actors and work well together.,1364774400,6,452,4.089887640449438
5558573,3,B00B5A9FOG,"I am in total agreement with the reviews of this season, when it was advertised as the final season i was very shocked, how are they going to fit everything they promised into one season ? Well i have developed a deep love of this series and am totally DISGUSTED with the writers... It still has Arthur as a person incapable of taking care of himself and Merlin as basically his slave, NOT the great people they should have become. It was actually like watching a rerun of earlier seasons just actors portraying different positions. What has happened to Kilgharrah ? The White Dragon ? Where is the story line of legend ? Come on writers and producers, WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO YOUR LOYAL FOLLOWERS ? ? ?",1363824000,25,705,4.430769230769231
5558574,2,B00B5A9FOG,"I liked the show until season4, but I must say this ending is a disaster.
The mission of Merlin was to save Arthur who is to become the 'Once & Future King' who would bless the Old Religion in the end.
This never happened. Merlin served Arthur with his life, but for what?
The core scenario of the series seems to be neglected in the final series.

--- Spoilers ahead ---
Merlin advises Arthur to deny magic so that Mordred will not be saved.
His purpose was to build a kingdom where druids and sorcerers are not treated as criminals.
At least that is what thought the whole story was about.
I almost fell out of my chair when I saw this episode. Overall, the executive producer had no control over the writings.

To many open ends untied. So many inconsistencies. I am truly disappointed with the final series.",1363651200,18,811,4.436241610738255
5558575,1,B00B5A9FOG,"I throughly enjoyed the whole series, even when it was a little uneven.  So I was really looking forward to buying the series with the commentary.  I started at the last episode, hoping for some more ideas as to where the main characters had ended up.  Instead there was a shoddy, puerile voiceover from Katie MacGrath and Julian Murphy.  It felt like being slapped in the face.  Don't bother buying the boxed set for completion.  It was an insult.  The fans deserved better not least for the abruptness of the ending after some quite patchy episodes.  Not worth it.",1363305600,10,566,4.646464646464646

8562749,1,B00B5A9FOG,"The endings of a series of shows can sometimes be a disappointment because you can have some aspects of the storyline in the aftermath of victory not show the fruits of the victory enough and leave you wishing you had seen more.  I would be much happier if that were the case with the final episode of Merlin to be merely a bit unsatisfied but the overall story being intact with a fitting closure...however, it isn't unsatsifying - it literally destroys the entire storyline of the entire series of Merlin starting with the first episode in the way it was ended.  This ending is not the ending of the story that had been told from the first time we see Merlin appear on screen and begin his journey with Arthur, and the ending renders all of those moments to have been pointless and for not.
While in the old legends of Arthur, he does indeed die in some depictions, the story of this show was about a very young Arthur just beginning his reign.  So saying he had to die to be in keeping with the original legend doesn't hold - not only because of this being a depiction of him very young and just getting started as King, but also because there is no one ""original legend.""  A young Arthur dying tragically is not the ending of the story we were being told from the first moment his destiny and that of Merlin's was revealed in the first episode...and all of the revelations related to it as each episode progressed.  This ending to Arthur and this story renders each of those moments meaningless...and depressing to rewatch, knowing it will end in tragedy and never come to pass.  There were so many of these moments throughout the series - so many conversations between Gaius and Merlin, Merlin and Arthur, Gaius and Arthur, Merlin and his mother, Merlin and the Fisher King, and so many other moments with other characters that were just so very well written and performed and made the story so deep that after this ending are rendered pointless and depressing because it just isn't going to happen.  The ending destroys these scenes.  Not to mention the sacrifices (including laying down their lives) of other characters to protect the life of both Merlin and Arthur knowing what their supposed destiny is (such as Lancelot and Merlin's friend at his old village) are now for not when you see these scenes...makes them not only sad scenes but now tragic scenes...what they are sacrificing for does not occur.
The death of Arthur makes the storyline of the entire series from the first season unsalvagable alone...but apparently that wasn't enough destruction for the writers of the show.  They essentially decide to depict Merlin as having died as well...cursed to live alone in his regret and sorrow over failing to protect Arthur and what he would have become (not to mention he lost a friend he loved like a brother).  Merlin exiles himself from all of his other friends...he isn't there to see Gwen be coronated as the new leader.  He isn't there to be with Gaius and the surviving knights who all also loved him and were his good friends -  there is no closure to his grief presented in the ending of this series...and our beloved title character is shown as ultimately becoming someone who just wonders aimlessly for thousands of years in his grief and despair.  This renders the first scene where we see Merlin on that very first episode of the show, entering Camelot and Gaius' chambers, and every seen thereafter, a depressing thing to behold (especially his pep talks to Arthur) knowing how he will end up - a completely broken man who feels he failed in his entire life's purpose.  That is not a good story, and everything leading up to that had been so well done - to end it in a way that destroys all of those other moments in this way is sad...and quite frankly, disgusting.
It is disrespectful to the fans of this shown who had loved it so much and disrespectful to the writers' own work of the previous 4 seasons, all now rendered pointless and depressing when before they were extraordinary and would have remained so with a fitting ending.  The way this ended the title of the show should not have been ""The Adventures of Merlin"" - they should have been honest and called it ""The Tragedy of Merlin"" from the very beginning.  Huge numbers of people who were fans of this show can longer find this show watchable again because of how the ending ruined the entirety of the story from the very beginning. Prior to this ending, I would have given this series 10 stars out of 5...that's how much I loved it and how well it was done...but with the way it ends, the entirety of the series doesn't deserve even 1 star.  I can't recommend this show to anyone because of how it ends...if you do, however, want to watch it - stop with the Season 4 finale.",1495152000,2,4767,4.569753810082063
