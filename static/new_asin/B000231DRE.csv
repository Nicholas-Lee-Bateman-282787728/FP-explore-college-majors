None worked.  This new DVD approach though has taught me more than all of the above combined!!  The features intrinsic in DVD technology are fully implemented in this Beatles DVD - I'm able to reduce the speed of video in order to follow along with the fingering and the way that the video segments will automatically repeat lets you follow along until you get it just right.  The song choice is amazing and ALL parts of the songs are covered -- with special attention to the leads.  I can't wait for a Volume 2!!!!",1084406400,,681,4.689075630252101
8020974,2,B000231DRE,"There is no TAB included!! So, you have to try to figure out the notes and chords by watching them play. This is VERY difficult to do! And in some places, it is impossible to tell what they are playing. I am a beginner and so I am finding this DVD very frustrating because I am spending most of my time trying to figure out the notes and then writing them down. So, unless you are an expert at learning music simply by watching others play, I would not recommend this DVD.",1278460800,,472,4.141304347826087
8020975,5,B000231DRE,"After reading all the bad reviews I was a bit skeptic about this dvd. But being a big Beatle fan I decided to give it a shot. I have the ""Beatles Complete Scores"" but the print is so small it takes forever to learn the solos and noticed a few mistakes on the tabs also. I love this dvd, i've been playing some 25+ years and know a lot of beatle songs but had trouble learning some of the solos. With the loop feature you can play along with the solos in slow motion untill you've got it down. I learned several the first day. The Beatles music is more complex than some people think. I don't recommend this for beginners but for musicians who are used to jammin with other guitarist and can learn from watching other guitarist this is great. When i first started learning guitar there wasn't any tab so we had to pay close attention to other guitarist. Anyway for me this works great. I hope there is a vol. 2, 3, and on and on.",1134864000,2,928,4.161111111111111
8020976,3,B000231DRE,"This video is for those guitarists that can learn from watching. As other reviewers have noted, there are no tabs included. I empathize with those new to guitar eager to learn Beatles songs and are frustrated by the lack of tab. However,  intermediate and advanced players can really benefit from this video. The feature that really stands out is the looping of the individual guitar parts. Instead of constantly pausing and rewinding, just sit back and listen/watch the same riff/lead until ""you get it"". If this video had on screen tab and some commentary, it would get 5 stars from me.",1120953600,3,588,4.821782178217822
8020977,1,B000231DRE,It will take you forever to learn a song from this DVD. You cannot see what notes the guy is playing. His fingers block the view of the frets. No TAB or chords provided. The company should at least provide TAB on their web site.,1104796800,9,228,4.088888888888889
8020978,3,B000231DRE,"Like others, bought this for my son after reading positive reviews. However, like the other negative reviews, I'd agree that this program has a serious flaw that you should be aware of : without any on-screen image to match what the guitarist's fingers are doing, it gets pretty confusing, as you cannot tell what the fingers are doing.

However, the musicianship and musical insights are great : very authentic styles for all the guitar parts in all the songs.",1104796800,4,461,4.8354430379746836
8020979,2,B000231DRE,"I got this DVD for Christmas and was exciting to learn some Beatles songs.  My excitement quickly turned to frustration.  The DVD is only a collection of up close videos of Mike playing his guitar.  There is no tab, no music, no descriptions of any kind to tell you how to play any of these songs.  I spent an hour trying to tab out the first few measures of Back in the USSR.  At tempo or even in slow motion, this was impossible.  Ask yourself if you can simply watch someone play and then play yourself without any instruction on what chords or notes to play.  When I complained to GuitarSolutions.com, they suggested several books that I could purchase to supplement the DVD.  I wish I had just received the books.  I would be playing my favorite Beatles tunes by now.",1104537600,9,772,4.418439716312057
8020980,2,B000231DRE,"After reading the good reviews I went and bought this DVD and after watching it I have to say i'm very disappointed and completly disagree with those previous reviews. While this DVD does have alot of good features like looping and slow motion playing, it's missing one of the most important things: On screen or printed tabs/chords for each song. It does show you the leads, riffs, chorus parts but it's idiotic to not be able to know exactly what the guy is playing! You are going to have to watch each solo section 100 times or slow it down and write down for yourself exactly what is played on which fret, and even then you have to switch between close ups and wide angle to see exactly which string he did play. Would it have really been that much trouble to add onscreen TAB/Chord diagrams or a printed booklet? Unfortunately this DVD is just going to be an exercise in frustration for most people. There's no place on their website to download the tabs either. Novice guitarists will have alot of trouble with this DVD as there is no vocal instruction nor help or hints at how to play each song either.  Plain and simple this DVD is just a guitarist playing Beatles songs with close ups of his hand. While it is a good first attempt by this company and really a decent price for the enormous amount of content as compared to the SongXpress series which only have 4 songs per DVD I would hesitate to recommend this to anyone other then Advanced players with good memories. I would have given it one star except that it does have pretty good sound for an instrucional DVD. Do yourself a favour and just buy a tab book as it's going to take you ten time longer to learn any of these songs by just watching this.",1099785600,11,1715,4.3930817610062896
8020981,5,B000231DRE,"For an lazy intermediate player, this is a quick way to learn great songs.  I just wish there were more of them.",1098144000,,112,4.090909090909091
8020982,5,B000231DRE,"I agree with the other reviewers in that if you're looking for TAB and precise step-by-step instructions on how to play, this is not the DVD for you. (I recommend the songxpress series for this - it includes no Beatles, but other classics)

For those, looking to learn by ear, this is a great DVD. I bought this DVD to get a better understanding of some of my favorite Beatles songs. In general, with Beatles songs, and most other music, there are many instruments layered on top of one another. It's sometimes difficult to discern the particular guitar part that you want to hear. This DVD breaks down each song into the various guitar sections, with each part played separately, slow and at normal speed. There are also multiple camera angles; you can get a close up view of the fretboard and also a wide view to see what the right hand is doing.

The DVD has a great feature that keeps looping back the chosen part so you don't have to keep hitting rewind over and over. The DVD does it for you, making the songs so much easier to figure out. Nice technology.

This DVD is much easier to use than TAB. To be able to see what is being played, makes the learning process much easier.",1096934400,2,1184,4.397260273972603
8020983,5,B000231DRE,"I'm 50 and have been playing for 35+ years, I learned some of these songs incorrectly as a young begineer. The looping feature of this DVD allowed me to clean up my act easily. This disk is ideal for the player who has basic chops but can't/doesn't want to read music and wants to learn to play these classic tunes. The selectable camera views and menu selection ease (lead rhythm) is 5 stars, very easy to use. The guitar tones are authentic the only suggestion I could make to this disk is to let us know how you set up your amp to get these killers tones.",1084492800,,558,4.224299065420561
