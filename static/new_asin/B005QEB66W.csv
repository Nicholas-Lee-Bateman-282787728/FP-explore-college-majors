It's a blatantly obvious bootleg taken from a TV broadcast:  There are even  channel logos appearing from time to time at the lower right hand side of the screen.  I will keep it, however, as there is no other alternative.  I will keep looking for a real copy.  This film rates a much better package.",1403481600,5,358,4.430769230769231
4858328,4,B005QEB66W,"When we found a copy of the original book in an antique shop, we started looking for the DVD. After spending ages online I found it! Got the last one at that time. Can't wait to hear from my brother to find out how the movie was. Only thing that I wasn't thrilled about was it took nearly 3 weeks to arrive. No clue why it took so long.",1362096000,,336,3.8840579710144927

8483308,3,B005QEB66W,"These are the kind of movies I love. Old airplanes that don't exist anymore flying through the air. For this genre of movie, I have to overlook a lot of flaws in the movie itself. For me, no problem.  I love classic aviation movies, the cheesier the better.

The biggest problem with this flying movie is there isn't much flying. It seems like the legendary director, William A. Wellman, spent the budget on technicolor and not airplanes scenes.

This screen writer had a hard time devising a plot. This isn't a war movie, it's not a romance movie and it's not an aviation history movie, but it tries unsuccessfully to be all three.

There are a few flying scenes of old aircraft, but not many. There is nothing to get excited about. There are no good guys or bad guys. There is a very short generic WWI flying scene. There are a couple of other planes flying splattered here and there, but that's it.

The disk quality is good if you are going to buy this one, against my advice, some reviewers ran into that issue.

I found myself bored in the first 15 minutes and stayed that way until the end. If you are looking for a good old flying movie, keep looking. This is not the place.",1457222400,,1182,4.3744292237442925
8483309,5,B005QEB66W,"Absolutely pristine copy of a very good movie. I last saw this movie in the sixties on a black and white tv and it wasn't till recently that I learned it had been filmed in color. And what color it is , absolutely beautiful ! If you like airplanes and even if you don't this movie is very good just for the photography and aerial shots. The previous reviews about bad copies and poor video quality aren't talking about this DVD. It doesn't get any better than this!",1452902400,5,465,4.295454545454546
8483310,4,B005QEB66W,"Here's another classic example of how old time cinema had some of the best movies going for it. First off, this 1938, early Technicolor movie was directed by the legendary William Wellman, whose 1927 film WINGS, was the first movie to win a Best Picture Oscar at the first Academy Awards. Second you have great acting from Fred MacMurray, Ray Milland, Donald O'Connor, and Louise Campbell. Since it's set in WWI, you get some killer flying sequences with mostly authentic World War I aircraft, including an actual Fokker D.VII. The plot is a little on the weak side, but the action and the acting make up for it.",1435190400,4,612,4.675925925925926

8483314,1,B005QEB66W,"Quality of the DVD was very bad.  Was retaped from a local program.  Color was bad.  Some scenes were shown twice.
Overall the program was bad.  In some scenes, the DVD completely stopped, then started over again.",1405555200,4,213,4.675675675675675
