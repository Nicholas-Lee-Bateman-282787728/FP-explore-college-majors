2214607,5,B0007KIFSM,"As Told By Ginger is a great show that is only available on 2 DVDs! They need to put the complete series on DVD, or at least a couple of seasons. I really want to own the special episode were they go to camp caprice.
The story on this particular DVD is great, it's about the mixed feelings of change through the eyes of a teenage girl. Ginger is torn between going to a very exclusive school of the Arts or to stay home and stay surrounded by her friends. while Ginger is gone Darren realizes that he has feelings for her and runs after her. It's a very sweet story. I recommend it for every family to enjoy.",1270252800,20,608,4.117647058823529

2214616,5,B0007KIFSM,I loved this show - I miss this show. Why won't it be released on a full box set. This is one of the hour long episodes of when Ginger was accepted to a artistic academy. The cute themes and journaling is nice - if you are a late 80's kid; you understand how great the early 2000's was. Oh Nickelodeon - when they made good shows. *Sigh*,1391817600,7,337,3.9705882352941178
