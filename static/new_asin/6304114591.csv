783316,4,6304114591,"`The Subject was Roses' reminded me, in a way, of `Long Day's Journey into Night', as far as the strength in its ability to flesh out the family dynamic from a fragmented point of view.  The father/son, mother/son, father/mother dynamics are all equally delved into and given true depth of feeling (which leads to my quibble about Albertson's Oscar win in the Supporting category, when he is clearly one of THREE leads) and the impact of the film's finale is beautifully rendered.  As with many `stage to screen' adaptations, there is a stuffiness that can come into play and I saw that here, more so than in the 1962 masterpiece `Long Day's Journey into Night'.  It is a minor issue, but one that is present throughout certain sections of the film, and the dated approach to the `night out' felt off-putting and awkward in the overall construction of the film itself.  Albertson is outstanding and, in my eyes, best in show.  His mood changes are perfectly timed and really flesh out the intensity of the film itself.  Sheen is also very good in his role, and the magnificent Patricia Neal is beautifully inflected (the way she plays with her inner demons is flawless).  If you enjoy deep character studies that don't offer an easy out (this film will not leave you with a warm feeling in your stomach) then this is certainly a film you'll want to check out.",1339977600,4,1359,4.661087866108787
783317,4,6304114591,"The movie has good, witty, occasionally "" from left field"" dialog. I'm from Spring Lake and enjoy a brief ""walk"" down memory lane when Patricia Neal visited the Monmouth hotel.",1268524800,6,176,4.9
783318,5,6304114591,"The Subject was Roses is a lengthy play written by Frank D. Gilroy and it has won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama  and was nominated for five Tony Awards.  The 1964 production received two Tony Awards, one for Best Play and Best Actor (Jack Albertson).  Martin Sheen also starred in the stage production with Albertson.

And now, writer Gilroy has also adapted the screenplay.  The film was made in 1968 with Patricia Neal as Nettie Cleary, Jack Albertson as John Cleary and Martin Sheen as Timmy Cleary.  The time is 1946, setting in New York.  Middle-age parents John and Nettie have just received their son Timmy home from the war.  He has been gone 3 years now and he soon discovers coming home is the same as before he left, in the middle of the marital discord of his parents.

Most of the first hour of the film, we see this pretense, a faade as John and Timmy reunite at home, sharing some memories, laughing.  But soon, there is a shift in mannerism and mood, as we see the real attitude John has about his son, the veteran.  John missed out on some opportunities in life, missed the service, etc., and he also has a history of infidelity that rocks the marriage thus meshed into a cold distant relationship with Nettie.

Most people will never read the dramatic play.  They will have seen or heard of Subject was Roses for the first time through this film.  If you see the film, note that just before the first hour, it may not seem like much to you, but give it time, as the first hour shows us the coming together, tension, uneasiness, some fun, etc.

It is later that the mood changes, and we learn so much about the characters.  Very little has been changed from the original play, and many times the scenes are very similar to the original play, which is what I prefer to see, the actual stage production, but this did not stray far from it.  Characters are perfect in their roles.

Martin Sheen, Jack Albertson and Patricia Neal star in this film, with few other supporting cast members.

Sheen is a returning army corporal following the Second World War.  Jack Albertson plays his father, a harsh, dictatorial man who is inclined to lay down the law in the household.  His mother, Patricia Neal, is his long-suffering wife who manages to get her licks in.  A dysfunctional family, to say the least.

The young soldier manages to sort things out in the end.  It is not, really, a surprise ending: rather as happy an ending as might be expected under the circumstances.

They all played their parts well.  Probably Albertson played his character best, although Neal was excellent as well. So was Sheen, to be fair. Patricia Neal was recovering from an illness when she made the movie, and Sheen was concerned about her health during a dance scene, but he said she did better than he had expected, and in fact had a hard time letting him lead.

783321,5,6304114591,This is a moving film starring a very young Martin Sheen. Set at the end of WW2 Sheen comes home an older and wiser man. How he and his mom and dad adjust to his return is very well told. Some excellent soundtrack music is more than matched by excellent dialogue and some wonderful photography.,1058227200,9,294,4.363636363636363

7862028,4,6304114591,"How I wish I could have seen ""The Subject Was Roses"" on Broadway! I've watched the film several times over the years and it strikes me that some plays just don't fit the motion picture form.

Nevertheless, the film is a work in its own right, and I'm glad to be able to retire my VHS copy.

The scene in which Patricia Neal's character takes her coins, boards a streamliner bus, and escapes to the shore remains a visual and auditory treat. Fine details like color and lighting make you feel Nettie's sense of alienation. Judy Collins' accompaniment is distinct from her album work; today, we'd call it ""unplugged"" or ""acoustic"".

Don't expect much from the DVD itself. The source print was less-than-pristine, and no effort was put into menus, chaptering, or extras.",1486857600,,767,4.7518796992481205
