4712570,5,B005JEJYF4,"This is what an exercise dvd should be. I'm now more puzzled and displeased than ever as to why almost every exercise dvd is so poorly produced. I would recommend these dvds to everyone. Rather than giving you a full review, I am sure they have some of the sessions on youtube. Check them out and then support the makers of these videos and purchase a copy yourself.",1354838400,,366,4.397058823529412
4712571,4,B005JEJYF4,"This is not a difficult workout (the last couple are a little tougher), but there are a number of 20 minute-ish ""shows"" which are well done.  The scenery is nice, and the cuing is fairly good.  When I'm not in the mood to workout, I do this, as it's not extremely taxing.  I do plan to order another part of the series.",1353542400,,319,4.112903225806452
4712572,5,B005JEJYF4,"This was my favorite program on Fit TV and I was so sad to see it go! I had two episodes saved on my DVR, which crashed back in July. Having the commercial free option, and many choices, is a breath of fresh air :)",1351036800,,214,3.7777777777777777
4712573,5,B005JEJYF4,I love this! I loved the series and was sad to see it go.  The video is the show with no commercials.,1343779200,3,101,3.590909090909091
4712574,5,B005JEJYF4,"it sucks that that took these off fit tv. they were about the best thing on. but, it is much nicer have the freedom to pick and choose without watching commercials. very very well done. i look forward to doing it every morning. i haven't seen any videos that compare.",1329523200,3,267,4.36
4712575,5,B005JEJYF4,"After getting a few different Yoga DVDs I saw this and, remembering the series from TV a while ago, bought the first season.

Hands down, this is the best Yoga DVD I've seen.  The production quality is outstanding, the models are fit and competent at the moves, the instructor's voice is clear pleasant and keeps up extremely well with both the movements and the breathing.

The workouts are good for beginners to at least intermediate viewers.  They have challenging poses that beginners may have a little trouble with, but nothing like another ""beginner"" DVD I have where the second session has you propping your shins on your elbows and balancing your entire body on nothing but your two hands (I'm drawing a blank on the name of that pose at the moment).  They poses on this DVD set are challenging without going overboard.

If I could change anything on these the only thing I that comes to mind is that I'd like them a little longer.  They're about 28 minutes for warm up, workout and cool down.  It's not really difficult to run two episodes back to back, but I'd love it if these were about an hour long.

I still give this series 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1326931200,9,1171,4.538095238095238
4712576,5,B005JEJYF4,"I absolutely love this yoga series. I've done yoga for many years, my first ones were on VHS tape, pre-DVD. I'd had dozens of them over the years, searching for just the right one. THIS is the right one. It's done beautifully. The camera angles allow you to see how to do each step. They move smoothly. The work out at every level is excellent. The scenery is calming. Even the voice of the narrator is absolutely perfect. If you've had a dozen or so yoga DVDs, then you know that the voice of the narrator can be annoying and make you not want to listen to it This narrator - whom I believe to be Kate Potter herself - is truly enjoyable, soothing and right in keeping with the gentle, healing nature of yoga.",1455408000,6,710,4.266666666666667
4712577,4,B005JEJYF4,"These are all nice short, not too challenging, yoga sequences.  The negative aspect is they are not easy to follow.  They are flow practices that move along at a moderate pace.  I found myself constantly looking at the screen as the narrative went along quite quickly.  The scenes are constantly changing which breaks concentration and continuity.  On the positive side, once you have run through them a couple of times, it becomes familiar territory and much easier.  I will recommend watching once before you actually engage in the practice.  I am a yoga junky, so I am not discouraged by having to put forth a bit more effort to get into the flow.  It is a different type of practice and I really like the shorter classes which fit into a hectic schedule.  I will be purchasing season 1. And hope that it is also a pleasant and maintainable flow series.",1451001600,,856,4.6158940397351

4712581,5,B005JEJYF4,"I benefit tremendously both in flexibility & tone (I'm 70), and by accenting the breathing - ending sessions a different person, at least 4 days per week.  I don't follow the screen once it's familiar but the pleasant presenters & Vancouver scene changes set it apart.  But year two has a little nicer narrative, is more inspirational, and the movement-poses are less athletic versus two demanding sessions of Season One.",1434758400,4,421,5.0

I was sad when they stopped airing it, finally I went tp purchase it.  I wished they had advertized what positions where goign to be covered in each series. I really wanted to have the swan positions but it was not in the Season One Part One, but I am still happy to be doing my yoga again!!!!

The voice-over is great (calm, not sing-songy, not preachy), the scenery is beautiful and ever-changing, and the workouts are approachable for a wide range of levels. I highly recommend it.

I am fairly new to yoga and meditation.  It was hard for me to stay focused.  This series has become a vital part of my daily routine.  I cannot imagine a day without it!  The soothing voice and beautiful scenery are so relaxing.  The instruction of breathing and yoga are so revitalizing. This series has definitely been a life changer for me.  It is expensive but well worth the price.,1483833600,,531,4.292929292929293

8475648,5,B005JEJYF4,"Namaste Yoga has been central to my practice for three months now. I have been on the mat every day with Namaste and find that the flows are an awesome addition to my teaching DDPYoga and practicing other styles. Season two continues from season one with Kate Potter teaching the flows and the same cast as season 1.

On the Namaste TV website season two is described as: ""Continue your practice with Namaste Yoga, Season Two.  Enjoy the same soothing narration, gorgeous vistas and calming music in 13 all new Vinyasa Yoga sequences designed by master yoga teacher Kate Potter.  Master new poses, including Sage Pose, Pigeon Pose and Dancing Shiva, and enjoy the addition of inspiring mantras at the close of each class."" And like season 1 each flow is 24 minutes in length, it begins with a 4-5 minute warmup, followed by a 12 minute sequence and then a 5-6 minute cool down and savasana.

And now a short summary of each flow in this series:

Episode 201
Sunbird
This sequence has a lot of Hero poses, it is the beginning and end of each segment of the flow. I love the sunbird lift and sunbird bow. I also really enjoy the gate poses during the transitions. The whole practice is on the mat or floor work no standing. The 1 legged down dog to 1 legged plank and pack are an awesome strength builder. Overall just a great flow.

Episode 202
Heart Opening
This is a great sequence. It is a progressive flow that builds to triangle pose.  It is a nice flow through the progression. It feels slower than some of the other sequences with a gentler pace. And the full flow is done through on both sides once after the teaching phase is complete.

Episode 203
Triangle
Love the warm up starting with staff pose and a number of variations and stretches from that starting point. It is very interesting going from triangle to warrior rather than other way around. Another all standing sequence.

Episode 204
Warrior
This is a strong progressive flow. It builds with each sequence after doing both sides. There is a lot of chain pose, but also a lot of chest lifts and gentle back bends. Between the chair poses, warriors one, two, and three. Great for leg strength and balance.

Episode 205
Sun Wind
This sequence has a good mix of balance and strengthening postures. I love all the pigeon poses. Like some others this seems to be a slower pace but it requires so much work that is deceptive.

Episode 206
Seated Twist
At times I really enjoy these sequences that are 100% on the floor. They are very different from standing or mixed sequences. A good way to finish off the first part of Season 2.

There are 6 great flows in the collection. No matter how many times I hop on the mat for Kate's teaching I always enjoy it. Unlike some other instructors I have encountered where after a while you get tired of their voice or teaching style, that just does not happen with Namaste TV and especially the flows by Kate Potter. These flows will teach you proper alignment and also help you learn to go deeper into some of the more advanced poses. Below are some pros and cons of these workouts:

Pros:
Kate Potters teaching style
The incredible scenery
Take your practice to the next level

Cons:
How addictive they are
That they are only 22 minutes
 cannot come up with a third one

I recently found out that Namaste TV is now 10 years old. These flows have aged very well. I have encountered other workout disks that age very quickly. These ones will have an extended longevity because of the quality of the production, cinematography and teaching style. I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying these flows. These flows are wonderful and I highly recommend them.",1459728000,,3651,4.551145038167939
8475649,5,B005JEJYF4,"I really like Season 2 of the Namaste Yoga videos.  I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to yoga.

They are very well made, have beautiful scenery, which may sound odd for a yoga video, but it makes it easy and fun to follow. Each episode/video is not all located in the same place, it changes different scenery throughout each one, so they definitely aren't boring to watch/follow.
