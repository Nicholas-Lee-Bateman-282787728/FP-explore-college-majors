8276219,5,B001A671SW,"My father has gained substantial weight in the last decade or so, and is quite out of shape.  I wanted him to enjoy more freedom to play with my son, and better overall health.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN AN ASTROLOGY PERSON, but this video (introduced to me by a client) was so gently encouraging and non-judgmental, it seemed just right for my somewhat cantankerous dad.  Well, HE LOVES IT.  He is losing weight at a safe and reasonable pace, and has more energy than he has in a long time.  He is unlikely to become George Clooney or Brad Pitt at 69, but he looks and feels better and can now play more of the games an eight year old grandson pleads for. Total SUCCESS!",1221436800,3,663,4.272
