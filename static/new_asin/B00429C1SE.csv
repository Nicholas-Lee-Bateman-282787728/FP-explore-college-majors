4246914,3,B00429C1SE,"I have several of Leslie's videos. I love her 5 mile walk video and several of her other ones. In this one she seems a bit off. Maybe she got very tired during this workout. At one point she has one of her walkers take over, which was fine, she did great but she had no microphone so you couldn't hear her. Also the James Brown music seemed to be too slow for the steps. I use this video once in a while but there are others of hers that I like much better.",1297900800,2,457,3.872340425531915
4246915,5,B00429C1SE,"This DVD has new fast music and the workout goes fast, making it one of my favorites. Some of the transitions between the different steps could have been smoother, but overall you will enjoy the fast-pace and energy of some of the veteran walkers, who have been in Leslie's other videos. There are a variety of steps, with less time spent on each step, making for less repetition and lots of variety. This DVD will keep you awake and before you know it, the workout is over. The walker's outfits are brightly colored and add to the energy of the video. There is an add-on cool down, which I especially liked, since I am not usually quite ready to end and slow down. This adds a few extra minutes for a smoother transition to the cool down. This DVD is a great choice to add to your library of Leslie Sansone walk videos.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-3-Fast-Miles/dp/B00429C1SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: 3 Fast Miles</a>",1296864000,,991,5.2
4246916,5,B00429C1SE,"I bought this DVD today and did my first workout tonight.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I am 24 years old and extremely overweight (300+ pounds) and I've been trying to find a high-paced workout that isn't too high paced for me, being as out of shape as I am.  I have been trying to lose weight for a few months now, working out in gyms, on Wii Fit, and with active Wii games such as Just Dance and Just Dance 2.  But this workout was truly awesome.  It is really fast paced and 45 minutes long, but my mom and I finished the entire 45 minute workout on our first try and really enjoyed it.  I think if I can do it almost anyone can.  I'll post some good weight loss results later (fingers crossed!)",1296432000,17,700,4.140740740740741
4246917,4,B00429C1SE,"I am a loyal follower of Leslie Sansone and own many of her DVD's.  I was disappointed in this one in that it was the exact same walk as one I already own just with a new jacket cover.  I thought I was buying a new ""walking workout"" and when I popped it in I was very disappointed to see it was the same.  So now I own 2.  Her ""walks"" are great though.",1296345600,2,352,3.7162162162162162
4246918,2,B00429C1SE,"I did this workout two times completely through and almost passed out each time from the extremely fast pace. By the middle of the video even Leslie looked terrible; her outfit was covered in fresh wet sweat, her hair was plastered to her face, and the girl next to her, was very red-faced and looked ready to fall over. Along with Leslie there are 6 other walkers, but most looked much better towards the end than Leslie did - in her own video she couldn't keep up. The music was 50s rock and roll but was barely audible over Leslie's talking. The music also didn't match well with the moves; the DVD would have been better with just instrumental music. Anyhow, the workout is about 45 minutes long, each mile (3 total) is about 16 minutes, with a very small warm-up and cool down section. The moves are the same from her other videos: knee lifts, side steps, and kicks, although this DVD had tons of side-steps in comparison to her other DVDs. There are no 'boosters' in this walk since the pace is so fast. The reason I do Leslie's walking workouts are because of the relatively slow pace and consistency of movement; I want to enjoy my workouts and have fun, and not feel like I'm working out. This DVD made me hate my 45 minutes of exercise and left me with a very unpleasant feeling. Despite being in-shape and a daily exerciser, I found this walk too fast.",1295654400,7,1363,4.434262948207171
4246919,5,B00429C1SE,"My wife owns other Leslie Sansone dvd's and enjoys this one, too.  She likes to keep mixing it up with various workouts.",1295481600,2,120,4.454545454545454
4246920,5,B00429C1SE,"This is one of Leslie's best walking dvds,if not the best. She really gets you pumped up quickly. You are constantly in motion with some new routines added in. Sweaty,you bet!",1295136000,5,175,4.67741935483871
4246921,5,B00429C1SE,This is the fourth Leslie Sansone DVD in my collection and I consider it one of the best.  I use her videos three to five times a week.  I'm not letting age (82) slow me down and Leslie's latest two DVD's are an immense boost.,1293667200,23,226,4.0
4246922,3,B00429C1SE,"Buyer beware: the name of this workout has not been changed, but the cover has.  This is the same 3 mile workout from the DVD set that includes Fast Start (1&2 miles)and 3 Fast Miles.",1288051200,94,183,4.228571428571429
4246943,4,B00429C1SE,A good in-door workout for days when I can't get outside. There is enough variety to keep me moving. I wish Leslie would not chatter as much though.  I have her script memorized by now.,1423872000,,185,4.285714285714286

4246945,5,B00429C1SE,THIS WORKOUT REALLY SHOOK UP MY WEIGHT LOSS.,1407542400,,44,4.625
4246946,4,B00429C1SE,"I was looking for a walking tape that kept a fast pace for at least 30 minutes....and this did it. I didn't want any other exercise  It starts out with warm up and ends with cool down. Leslie talks too much...and the music is not the greatest....but it works for me.  One of the best things is that you only need a very small place to do this in.  Yes, your heart rate does go up.  I use this dvd  in my laptop computer when I travel or need to be indoors. I researched a lot to find this and I am glad I found it!!",1401926400,,515,3.8207547169811322
4246947,3,B00429C1SE,"This is a nice workout; however, thru 80% of the workout everyone is 'off-beat' with the music.  I don't know if the video is just synched badly.. or if they added the music later.  Drives me nuts!!  So when I chose to excise to this video, I listen and follow .. but don't watch their moves as closely.  Look away!! I know that Leslie says to 'Just Move' and not worry about moving the same as they are .. but I LIKE being in sync with the others in the group!  Still .. a good sweat.",1371081600,,485,4.010416666666667
4246948,5,B00429C1SE,This one is another good one from Leslie:) it is very fast :) you will be tired faster than normal:) it is FAST. I just wish the warm up was a bit slower and 2 min longer :) Love Leslie!,1369440000,,186,3.675
4246949,5,B00429C1SE,have several dvd's and enjoy them alot. have lost some pounds but more inches thanb I thought . walking is fun!,1366416000,,111,4.333333333333333
4246950,5,B00429C1SE,This work out video is great cardo exercise. It is low impact but fast pace. If you cant keep up just keep moving and you will lose weight. I love it!!,1360368000,,151,3.903225806451613
4246951,5,B00429C1SE,I love this workout. It gets your heart rate up and oxygen flowing so that you have energy rather than getting tired afterwards. I am able to finish it because it's not too fast paced or difficult. Great for beginners and non-exercisers.,1351382400,,237,4.666666666666667
4246952,3,B00429C1SE,"I borrowed this one from the library, and I really like doing it, but I probably won't add this one to my collection.  The workout is good, and I like the pretty fast pace, but some of the things about it just kinda bother me.  Like when she says she is going to go ""mambo with her baby"" and then stops to talk to someone else on the way and almost doesn't even get back to her daughter.  Also, the camera work is not the best.  It zooms in weird sometimes.  Also, she has one of the other ladies lead the workout for part of the time, which wouldn't be so bad, but Leslie is the only one who has a microphone on, so you can't even hear what the other lady is saying.  You only hear Leslie's comments about what is being done.  I try to somewhat read lips as well as just following the actions, but it would be nice, when she talks to people, to be able to hear their responses.  If you are looking for a good fast 3 miles, though, then it definitely delivers.",1335225600,,960,4.042328042328043
4246953,3,B00429C1SE,"This is a good, solid, typical Leslie Sansone workout.  The pace is a little faster than normal, as suggested by the title.

I'll cut to the chase as to why I deducted two stars, in order of importance (to me).  First, Leslie has Mary Kay lead the workout for a couple minutes in the third mile, but SHE'S NOT MIKED, for goodness sake!  Why they couldn't have reshot that segment or added a voiceover later is beyond me.  Shame on the editor for that one.  Second, the cooldown song is very fast and doesn't match the moves or pace.  Third, the cuing is pretty bad even for Leslie.  Fourth, they never announce when you get through the second mile, so this workout can really only be used for a one- or three-mile workout.

One of the good points is that all the background exercisers know what they're doing and don't mess up much.  (When they do, it's usually because Leslie miscued.)  It drives me nuts when Leslie includes a person who is constantly off-beat.

I still like it overall and don't regret purchasing.  But you'd think for as long as she's been making workouts, stuff like editing and cuing would have been perfected by now.

PS:  I have the original ""Walk Slim"" version of this DVD.  If they fixed the problem with MK not being miked in the new version, someone please let me know.  :)",1331424000,,1302,4.4491525423728815
4246954,3,B00429C1SE,Being in my early sixties it was hard for me to follow this DVD. Leslie and the girls seem very disorganized in this one. I really like most of her DVD's but this one doesn't flow as nice as the others. Also the music is not so good.,1315008000,3,233,3.875
4246955,5,B00429C1SE,This is a great 40 minute aerobic workout that can be done right in your home in about a 4 foot square space.  Started doing it also with a group of women at CHurch.  They all love it.  Highly recommended..even though Leslie is a little too chatty.  Good music also.,1315008000,3,266,4.26
4246956,5,B00429C1SE,"I was introduced to Leslie via her 2 mile cd given with a Jenny Craig membership and FELL IN LOVE WITH HER!  She has great spirit and she is SUPER motivating.  Recently I bought this (3 mile) and the 5 mile...  I love the 3 mile so much that I bought two more, one to send to my cousin in Florida and one for my best gal pal in NY.  It's easy and fun!  You can't miss with Leslie!!",1313452800,3,381,3.7721518987341773
4246957,4,B00429C1SE,"Everytime I use this DVD, I definitely feel the effect. The problem is the abundance of talk by Leslie. She just won't stop! I know that I can put it on the ""music only"" option, but by the time I have done this only a few times, I don't bother to look at the screen. So.. I move around rather than stay in one place. As Leslie continues to talk, I think she loses the beat, then I sometimes lose the pace, and it just makes me crazy.. I can't help but wonder if others have tried to tell her that perhaps  we don't need quite so much talk throughout the entire program. If so, I don't think she listened. This is not my first Leslie Sansone DVD, so I do know what is coming with the chatter, but I keep thinking that maybe this one will be different. Oh well.",1307491200,,759,4.026490066225166
4246958,5,B00429C1SE,"I have been doing the Leslie Sansone DVD Walk at Home program for over a year now.  Her program helps me to be consistent with my walking no matter what the weather is.  I use to live in the city and ever since I had moved to the country, I had so many excuses with the terrain that I was going to walk on and the weather in Wisc. being so iffy.  I have increased to the 3 mile DVD's but only had one.  I was making up my own 3 miles between my 2 mile ones and my one mile DVD's.  I want to highly recommend to those of you who have increased your ability to the three mile to get this one!!!  It keeps the intensity throughout the whole 3 miles.  I feel this has started to make a BIG change in the way I look and fit into my clothes!!!  I also LOVE that there are faces of other gals that have been in her previous workouts and you can see they have had BIG changes in their figures!!!!  But not only that, it feels more like you have joined them in the studio and it is so fun and relaxed!!!  Get this one, you will love it.  It has some fun new moves and keeps you sweating the whole time.  At 48, I feel so fit and healthy doing these walking workouts AND NO INJURIES!!!!!!  THANK YOU LESLIE!!!!!!",1306454400,7,1202,3.9173553719008263
4246959,3,B00429C1SE,"My very first exercise video about 15 or so years ago was a Leslie Sansone.  I eventually abandoned the walking videos for more active ones.  I recently have come back to the walking videos and Leslie, having bought several of her newer ones.  This one is my least favorite.  I have a high tolerance for talking and bad music, but this one pushed me over the limits.  Leslie's cueing is way off, the music does not fit, and there is way too much chatter, even for Leslie.  Normally I don't mind, but this one got on my nerves. Iwould not buy this again as Leslie has others that are much better.

Update:  I have been doing it without sound (an option available on the DVD) and find it more tolerable--but the cueing is still way off.",1305763200,2,734,4.345588235294118
4246960,4,B00429C1SE,"I LOVE this workout.  Its fast all the way through and has incorporated some different combinations of moves than most of Leslie's other workouts.  Moves are easy to follow but sometimes the queueing is off a bit.  I really sweat to this one, and I'm in great shape!  I use a pedometer when I'm working out, and this DVD ends up slightly in excess of 5000 steps, which is half of my daily goal, in just slightly more than 45 minutes.  Its got a music only option, which is great on something that you watch again and again and again.  (And I will be watching it again and again and again.)

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 .... the stretch at the end is very minimal, especially for the calf muscles; really need more stretching since we've been using the muscles pretty heavily all the way through the ""walkout"".  I also don't like Leslie letting Mary lead the class, even for two minutes, although this one works alot better than some of the others that I've seen.",1305763200,2,970,4.379888268156424
4246961,5,B00429C1SE,"I own several of Leslies videos and have been working out with her 5 days a week for a few months now.  I use a heart rate monitor when I work out and have found that as I've gotten more fit it takes more effort to raise my heart rate to the proper level.  This DVD gets my heart rate up there without having to add my own boosts throughout the workout like I have to with some of her other DVD's now.  This one is really brisk and really fun. It's three miles without stopping unlike some of the others where you can choose each mile separately. The veteran walkers are great and her daughter is adorable and looks like she's having alot of fun. The music is feel good music.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were 4 miles instead of three.  I haven't noticed Leslie being ""off"". I think this workout is fantastic especially if you need a challenging workout. They are all sweating by the end but hey I am too. I think if your going to spend 45 minutes working out you want to be sweating by the end.",1301270400,2,1018,4.0954773869346734
4246962,3,B00429C1SE,"I enjoy Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds DVD's and was excited to try this one.  I have to say though, she was ""off"" in this video.  Her counting was off, she seemed like she got lost on a couple of occasions and as someone else said, she had another one of the ladies take over for her at one point.  It was strange.  What was interesting though is that Leslie actually broke a sweat this time.  That was kind of nice to see!  Her daughter was also in this video though she didn't look too excited to be there.  I still go back to my 2005 DVD, it just seems much more together.",1300060800,2,583,4.06140350877193
8413263,3,B00429C1SE,"I was excited to see some old timers from Leslies early workouts, including Carol, Joanne, Mary Kay, and Linda. Unlike Leslies more recent walkers, these ladies are focused on doing the workout, and aren't trying to ham it up for the camera. Unfortunately, the workout itself isn't one of my favorites. The music is ok, and the pace is fast. If you wanted to, you could probably boost (Leslies term) or jog instead of walk. What bothers me is that for much of the workout, the walkers aren't quite in sync with the music, and its distracting. Im certain that these ladies know how to walk to a beat, so I don't know what went wrong. I have to look away and focus on the music. For the most part, the workout consists of Leslies basic moves, with the addition of some mambos and tap outs. The pace is fast enough that the lack of variety doesnt bore me. The cool down is a complete train wreck. Its done to a techno mix of We Are Family that is way too fast for a cool down. At one point, Leslie acknowledges that the music is too fast, but advises you to slow down anyway. I find myself laughing during the cool down, because Leslie is telling you to do wee little sidesteps while dance party music blares in the background. I did enjoy seeing some of my favorite walkers, and I wish the workout was worthy of their return.",1520380800,,1323,4.317269076305221
