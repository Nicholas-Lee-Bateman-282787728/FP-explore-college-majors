3477487,1,B001B093T2,"Honestly, I will give some movies a chance, and may even let them play well beyond 15 minutes in hopes they get better, but I didn't even get that far before turning off this one.  To tell the truth, it didn't even leave enough impression to remember what it was about, lost me at hello!",1390348800,,287,4.218181818181818
3477488,1,B001B093T2,"No this was herendous. Its the indie garbage that marries the mumblecore scene and has a bastard child with b-rated horror likenesses.
I was trying to give this movie a chance several times....I couldn't kid myself.",1389484800,3,215,5.0
3477489,2,B001B093T2,"For me it was  boring, I found no thrill factor in this movie. It had reminded me of The Grudge both versions, boring and predictable.

3477490,3,B001B093T2,"It's a one-time-watch film. It had so much more potential of being a great horror film. It played the wrong music scores for the scary scenes. The music chosen was more of a person finding a clue than music scores that deliver the ""dun dun dun"" type of intro to creep the viewer out.

The actors chosen did not sell the scare like they could have. They were to nonchalant in convincing the audience of a malevolent presence. And us real horror buffs know what I mean.

In conclusion I was on the edge of my seat waiting for that combination of intense music scores and the blood and gore which accompany such films. I did not get it. The 3 star rating I gave is because it could have been a whole lot better. However, it's given an average grade when it could have been a roaring excellent.",1386288000,5,790,4.295302013422819
3477491,3,B001B093T2,"This movie was just okay.  I don't feel like I wasted my time.  I am glad I didn't spend any money on it though.  It seemed like a cross between The Grudge and The Ring only not nearly as creepy.  The premise was good though.  For free, if you don't have anything else to do, I would say watch it.  It wasn't terrible.  I didn't find it too scary though.",1383696000,12,354,3.9714285714285715
3477492,2,B001B093T2,"First off, if you really want WATCH ME, you can buy it cheaper as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Horror-Collection-V-2/dp/B0055SJYJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Horror Collection V.2</a>&nbsp;DVD set.

This film interested me because it was described as a slavish ripoff of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>, one of my favorite horror films of this century's first decade. (Not of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu/dp/B00DW5IM14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringu</a>, which I didn't like as much.) Sure, Japanese ghosts have been done to death in recent years, but WATCH ME sounded like an extremely shameless ripoff. I was intrigued.

Turns out WATCH ME is worse than I expected. And while it borrows from The Ring, it seems to steal as much from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grudge/dp/B001RUKHLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grudge</a>&nbsp;(another of my favorites).

WATCH ME is set in Australia, aside from a prologue in Beijing. Story concerns two college women doing term papers for cinema studies. They plan to research and analyze obscure snuff films. In the process, they stumble upon a ghost who curses their computer, sending a snuff film over their email accounts. You watch it, you die. (Usually.)

This is an amateurish, micro-budgeted production. Lighting is flat, inept, and ugly. The light's color temperature changes from room to room, so that some scenes have a warm, yellowish hue, others a cold, bluish hue, or whatever else.

That's great if such alternating light tones had an artistic intent behind them. But here it seems the filmmaker simply used whatever lamps were available in a room (florescent, incandescent, whatever), without aesthetic intent or coherency, creating a sloppy look. Color temperature, hues, shadows, however the scene looked after turning on whatever lights were in the room, that's how the filmmaker left it. At least that's how it looks.

Compare that to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>, with its consistent aqua-marine (i.e., WATERY) hues throughout the film, aesthetically supporting the tale of a girl who was DROWNED, as did the location (Seattle, with its RAIN)

The actors in WATCH ME are pretty bad, especially the lady detective, who neither looks (slovenly hair and dress) or sounds (bad dialog -- the writer's fault) like a detective.

Even so, I didn't hate this film. It's better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall-remake/dp/B00A0SLTCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall remake</a>, a film a saw several weeks ago that was SO bad I'm still trying to bash it from my memory.",1382832000,4,2984,6.793193717277487
3477493,1,B001B093T2,"The film is a low budget ""Ring"" rip-off. People die after watching a porno-snuff film either from a disc or on the Internet. A young pale woman with punk dyed red hair appears, walks like something from Juon (at times) and then kills the viewer. Sometimes people disappear a matter of seconds after watching the film, sometimes they drag it out. Because of the low budget aspect you don't see any killing, so they attempt to create suspense by playing the same 4 piano notes over and over. Toward the end of the film we discover there is an additional mystery aspect that wasn't developed, and that is some people who view the film don't get killed, but they don't know why.

The movie has that super VHS quality to it. The best part is that the pain of watching this film lasts for just 78 minutes...if you don't kill yourself before it is over. Lines not well written. Characters not developed. Plot has no sanity.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1329696000,2,944,4.514619883040936

8280800,3,B001B093T2,"It just barely rates 3 stars.

Lackluster writing that takes too long to make the point. The basic premise is reminiscent of ""The Grudge"" with an interesting morality twist.

The basic structure of the film is disjointed and episodic; the acting is minimally sufficient which I suppose is in line with the overall quality of the script.
There are hints of some interesting ideas and the morality play is pleasingly unexpected but nothing is fully developed.",1433030400,,457,5.0
8280801,5,B001B093T2,"I'm not comparing ""Watch Me"" to ""The Shining."" I'm saying this is a 5 star film for what it is: a first-attempt, low-budget, indie horror film. I really think that's the fair way to do this. Please hear me out on this. I really like low-budget independent horror movies, especially paranormal themed. (I wouldn't rate a movie in a genre I didn't like because that would be unfair.) But low budget indie horror has gotten really bad the last 5 to 7 years. Just look at the comments from people saying ""oh god i can not sit thru another really bad indie horror on [insert site here]."" According to imdb this movie was made for $4783.00 US dollars in 2006. The woman that conceived, directed and co-wrote this movie has no other credits before this. This is her first attempt at a horror movie. The guy that produced, edited, co-wrote and stars in this has one or two other movies before it on his imdb and that's it. Keep that in mind, ok? This movie hit a lot of the points I look for in this sub-genre. Most importantly THERE IS A PLOT! It gets off to a slow start but once it hits its pace it stays there with no lull. There really is a decent story here with several good plot points - discovering what the attachment can do, and then (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) finding out it doesn't work on everyone, learning the whole story of where it came from, understanding what the two main characters are hiding and/or doing, discovering the reason it affects some people and not others, and then you have an ending that wasn't totally predictable. Additionally, the effects are fine, (the creepy chick really is creepy!) suspense is built, you can hear the dialogue, and the acting is good. It's not Giovanni Ribisi and Meryl Streep, but for this level actor it is good. Really good, actually. I want more low-budget indie horror to be on this level. I want to encourage beginning horror directors and writers to make better films than the majority of what's out there now. If we rate movies by comparing them to other movies of the same financing level and industry experience, I think we'll get better movies out of it. Please don't try to hold a low budget indie film like this one to an impossibly high standard set by big-budget Hollywood like ""Insidious"" or ""Sinister."" Hey, you don't grade on a bell curve in school that covers 1st grade through 12th grade. You judge 1st graders compared to other 1st graders. That's how you teach and encourage them. You don't destroy them with negative comments because they didn't test as well as the 12th graders. I want more first- time writers to make more paranormal horror films on shoe-string budgets. And I want them to have interesting scripts and good acting And I want them to pay attention to the details that can ruin a film. That's why I gave this 5 stars. For what it is, it's 5 stars. I'd even say this is probably the best movie I've seen that was made for under $5,000 bucks in the last 15 years. Thank you for hearing me out.",1431475200,3,2982,4.4935543278084715

8280805,4,B001B093T2,"So, yes, the production values were low, probably due to the budget. However, the story was engaging and kept my interest throughout. The acting ranged from adequate to not but again, the strengths carried the film above its limitations. The visuals were effective and creepy. I'm talking here about the red headed girl. The underground film collector was a very interesting character and his contributions in the plot development were an important part of what made it good. I am not sorry I watched this at all, actually I'm glad I did, and it stands head and shoulders above its competition, in terms of similarly low budgeted offerings. This is coming from  a lifelong horror fan, who watches a horror film a day and I give almost anything a chance. My expectations are realistic, so you won't catch me bashing a film for being other than it possibly could be. I don't expect every horror movie to be a defining moment in the genre's history. Given the overall state of the genre in the last 10-15 years, I wouldn't expect anything like that to appear on a streaming only release. I would be surprised (though ecstatic) if something even close to that was released theatrically nowadays.. This one satisfied the horror junkie (though I wouldn't make the mistake of watching these lo, lo budgets during primetime viewing hour).",1391299200,,1330,4.833333333333333
