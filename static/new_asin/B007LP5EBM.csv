5099038,5,B007LP5EBM,I could not be more satisfied or impressed with this video! I am very grateful that I purchased it. The instructions provided are perfect for a beginner and I am definitely going to look for more videos of his to purchase!,1378252800,8,222,4.439024390243903
5099039,5,B007LP5EBM,"In the interest of self-disclosure, I have to admit that I am the student in this video with whom Sifu Ken Gullette appears in this video.
That said, I think this video is one of the best explanations of the most basic Baguazhang techniques.  Nothing in here is especially difficult.  Most of the techniques and training methods are stuff a newbie with little-to-no Bagua can learn to do. As in his other videos, Gullette strips away the mysticism and poetry and gets right to the point, making these techniques available to anyone who wants to put forth the effort to learn them.

Of the dozens of videotapes and DVD's in my personal library, I have to say that this one is one of the top five I view the most and put into practice.  Short of having a Bagua sifu of your own, this video is the best way to learn.",1354147200,18,813,4.364238410596027
8519441,5,B007LP5EBM,"I bought this a number of years ago and I still refer to it from time to time! If you want eight to twelve months of Ba Gua instruction, for $20 this is a great choice. Some of the material I knew, some I had seen elsewhere, some I had learned differently but you really would need to buy 3 or 4 dvd's to get all this material.  There was a criticism that in some parts it may have lacked depth; that may be a valid criticism, but as an introduction to Ba Gua it is a GREAT DEAL!  For example, I have two other dvd's with the pole walking, but they weren't easy to find and if I want more depth, I can look at those or Tom Bisio's DVD on walking the palms.  Anyway, I always felt that depth is something  that you discover in this art, not something that you are taught....",1509494400,,773,3.967741935483871
8519442,1,B007LP5EBM,"Gullette has clearly spent a lot of time practicing the forms. He also clearly does not understand what many of them are meant to be or why you would need them. If this was just a ""health"" exercise video it might be okay, but he tries to demonstrate the martial aspects and seems completely uncomfortable with it. The partner demonstrations were great for showing step by step how some of the movements might work, but without any kind of full speed demonstration it's difficult to tell what it would look like or how well it would work in an actual fight.
Conclusion: The only reason this should even get the one star is that the circle walking techniques are shown well.",1488240000,,672,4.56198347107438
8519443,4,B007LP5EBM,A really great DVD on Bagua,1480291200,,27,3.6666666666666665
8519444,5,B007LP5EBM,Everything is very well explained and demonstrated.  I found this helpful in learning the moves and principals.,1472083200,,111,5.529411764705882
8519445,2,B007LP5EBM,Its ok.,1471478400,,7,3.0
8519446,1,B007LP5EBM,"This dvd is not for a beginner.  It's more of a refresher on basic techniques for people who already know bagua.
 If you know nothing of bagua you'll be lost.
Biggest complaint with this dvd is the lack of any practice plan.
Your presented with a bunch of techniques and then left dangling.
Also, the inclusion of martial applications on a beginner dvd is premature.
Most people practice the internal arts for health rather than self defense anyway.
The instruction on the basic fixed palms form is good, but all too short (only takes up a few minutes on this dvd) and ,again, no practice plan.",1469318400,3,594,4.59433962264151
8519447,2,B007LP5EBM,Just Ok,1459900800,,7,3.0
8519448,5,B007LP5EBM,This is a very valuable presentation of the basic techniques and applications.  I highly recommend it for anyone new to the art.,1440028800,3,128,4.818181818181818
8519449,5,B007LP5EBM,Very Good DVD.,1439510400,2,14,4.0
8519450,5,B007LP5EBM,This is a very good instructional on teaching the very basic moments of Bagua.  If you are just beginning or need to refresh or fefine the basic techniques this dvd is a must.,1409529600,5,175,4.303030303030303
