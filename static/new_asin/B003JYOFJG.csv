4131474,2,B003JYOFJG,Dont buy the DVD. I thought this would be a cute movie for my child but it contains so much yelling and screaming. Better recommended for children 6 and older who can understand when its appropriate to make so much noise.,1309392000,4,221,4.414634146341464
4131475,5,B003JYOFJG,"This week I have entertained the lower elementary classes I see in the library with Mo Willems' stories Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus, Knuffle Bunny, and Leonardo the Terrible Monster.  My students are already familiar with these books, but now they have been brought to life for them on DVD.  There has been a great deal of laughter as they watched these familiar stories, and my own children at home have watched and re-watched this DVD many times.  Although I will always love reading a book more than watching a video, I will admit that the added dimension that video brings to the story makes them come alive for my students. I am already adding this to my list of must-do things for next year's students.",1304035200,3,715,4.5703125
4131476,4,B003JYOFJG,"My 8 year old loved these stories when he was younger.  He seems to have outgrown his interest.  My two year old likes the knuffle bunny but is not too excited about pigeon.  I think these are best for 2-6 year old kids.  I wish they had a few more stories like other scholastic DVD's  which usually have 6 to 8 stories.  This one only has 3.  I would give it 5 stars if they had at least 6 stories.  I suggest adding some selections from elephant and piggy, knuffle bunny too, and pigeon finds a hot dog and wants a puppy",1303603200,4,522,4.049019607843137
4131477,5,B003JYOFJG,"By far one of the cutest, silliest childrens' books I have ever read! We laugh out loud every time we read it! My mom was over recently while we read it and she kept saying how it reminded her of a seinfeld episode...I have read a few others of Mo William books and this was my favorite of his work.",1299456000,2,299,4.0
4131478,5,B003JYOFJG,"We have a 19 month old girl who LOVES this book!  She wants my husband to read it and the other pigeon books over and over to her at bedtime, which is a step up from the tantrum she would throw when we'd pull out any other book (she knew 'story time' was a sign she was going to bed soon and was fighting it).  I also enjoy listening to my husband read it to her, it makes us laugh every night.  :)",1299283200,2,398,3.7710843373493974
4131479,5,B003JYOFJG,"Our daughter is already a big Pigeon fan, and now with a DVD, the Pigeon comes to life even more for her.  Mo Willems is obviously very funny and the adults in the house enjoy the little bits of humor thrown in for them.  There is also some educational value, with the school visit where Mo teaches the children how to draw the Pigeon.  The other stories are also wonderfully told, and we appreciate the voices of the real Trixie and Mommy in Knuffle Bunny.",1295654400,,457,4.352941176470588
4131480,5,B003JYOFJG,"This book is adorable.  The illistrations and text are simple, but are filled with fun and easily understandable.  My 7 year old son loves the series and as a beginning reader he has began to practice using this book.  The humor attacted to the book makes it more interesting for him and encourages him to continue to read.  I love books that help my son feel good when he reads.",1295136000,,379,4.371428571428571
4131481,4,B003JYOFJG,"We love Mo Willems and it is wonderful for parents and kids alike to see his books come to life. The Mo Willems videos are well done, more so than some other of the scholastic storybook treasures. This set includes Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus, Knuffle Bunny, and Leonardo the Terrible Monster. I just wish that they would have made a new Mo video to add to this for those of us who already have Knuffle Bunny from an earlier collection. Please, Mo and Scholastic, make more! Make all the whole Knuffle Bunny series!",1286928000,20,522,4.447916666666667

4131485,5,B003JYOFJG,"My granddaughter introduced me to this book when we flew across the country to visit her.  She was a shy 2 years old and would only look at us sideways with one eye and with her head turned to the side (like the pigeon). When she later showed us this, her favorite book, we were delighted and have ordered the whole series for our other grandchildren. We cherish the memory of her sideways gaze.",1362268800,,395,4.337837837837838
4131486,5,B003JYOFJG,"We borrowed this from the library and that was the first time we'd ever heard the story. Now the books are INCREDIBLE, but this video just DOES IT. Brings it to life in the most fantastic way and makes you realize just how interactive the books are!!!!  Check this out!!!!!",1358380800,,273,4.46

4131488,5,B003JYOFJG,"My 4 year old has the books ""Don't let the Pigeon Drive the Bus"" and ""Knuffle Bunny"" which she loves. She loves this DVD and it has made her love the books even more. It also has fun extras.  My 8 year old pretends like she turns it on for her sister but I think she secretly enjoys it too!  I highly recommend it.",1357257600,,314,3.890625

4131491,4,B003JYOFJG,We love the pigeon books and are happy to have added this one to our collection. My daughter loves to tell the pigeon 'No!' no matter how many times or how many ways he asks. We also like looking for the pigeon in other Mo Willems books...he comes up everywhere!,1313539200,2,262,4.26

8398548,5,B003JYOFJG,I have had a ton of fun with this book - as well as all of the other Mo Willem's books. Children just roar with laughter when you read this to them especially if you are lucky enough to have a group of children. I was fortunate to work in a library and could enjoy this book with numerous children. I just love it. I also have such happy memories of my grandson cuddling with his great-grandmother and giggling as she read him this book. Precious memories and a wonderful book.,1423785600,,477,4.252747252747253
