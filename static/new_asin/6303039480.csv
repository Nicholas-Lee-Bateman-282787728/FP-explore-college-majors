7835245,5,6303039480,"I was so happy to be able to buy this movie out on Amazon.  I saw it many years ago and thought it was a great movie about past lives.  The acting was great in it and the movie had a lot of twist and turns.  I also am a big fan of Melissa Gilbert's acting and have enjoyed watching her grow from a young actress on ""Little House on the Prairie"" to a young woman.  This movie is just one of my favorites with her in it.

I want to thank the seller for making this movie available.",1401753600,,479,3.797979797979798
7835246,1,6303039480,"As a successful New York fashion designer who has recurring nightmares of a woman falling down an elevator shaft in this TVM directed by Arthur Alan Seidelman, Melissa Gilbert's uncordinated wardrobe is more alarming than any of the plot contrivances that writers George Schenck, Frank Cardea and Brian L Ross provide. The nightmares are diagnosed by a psychiatrist (styled to resemble a horror movie cast member and having a psychadelic hypnosis device) as past life regression which leads Gilbert to San Francisco as their locale.
The teleplay includes howlers like ""Stop living in the past"" and ""I told you 30 years ago I never wanted to see you again"", the cliche of Gilbert being grabbed as she looks down the open elevator shaft, and a newspaper clipping entitled ""Dead Woman's Motives Still a Mystery ... "". Seidelman provides a cut from the falling woman to a bag being thrown onto a desk, but regrettably also slow motion and tilted camerawork, and even scores a laugh off Gilbert by having someone give her a second look.
Although personally styled to look lovely and playing a woman of 30 which is her real age at the time of filming, Gilbert is hardly the sexpot that all the men keep admiring and her little girl voice undermines her attempt at adult acting. Seidelman does not cast Gilbert as the dead woman. Doing so may have added something to the pedestrian narrative also given the performance of the actress who does play her, but going from Gilbert's otherwise overdone reactions, it's a hard call.",1000771200,,1518,4.842307692307692
