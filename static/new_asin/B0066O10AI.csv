4962550,2,B0066O10AI,"Even though this anime has a multitude of strong points, it feels that each virtue is held back from shining due to its deficiencies. Lets start with the most obvious, there are only 6 episode in this season. Yes, I understand that each episode is twice as long as most Anime shows, however each episode here is written as if it were a 30 minute episode. Extending the episodes was easy for the writers, lots of silence after revelation so the involved character can stare into the distance and look as if their thoughts are worldly. In the end, the character, mainly the main character, just does either what he's told, what the audience predicts or both. Then there's the general anime rule that only one major combat can breakout per episode and for the most part that stands true. Unfortunately the single combat experience isn't longer than anime's of the same genre.

While I'm not going to continue specifically on the subject of the length of the show, it definitely makes an impact on the plot. From the first fight to the main character (spoiler: `fainting in the desert and ditching his harvesting duties,') very little is explained about the combat and the main character nearly dying on his trek, (spoiler:'witch appears to be a hopeless journey in the main characters eyes. Only a rescue he had no knowledge of saves him.') Finally we come to the place where everything really begins and ends. We're supposed see backstory made believable with a few sentences. Perhaps later talking about the past in a more comical manner might solidify the past, but again, it ends up being too short and the characters seem no more like buddies than before unless you're one who will just take their word. In which case you would have likely have decided already to enjoy the show.

Friendships, romance, character's mutual history, all end up being rubbish and in all honestly inconsequential. I'd like to say the combat is worse than the plot/script, but even such unoriginal, drawn out and ultimately confusing can't compete with the lack of story. Combat really never have any close calls, the tactics they use are the same a 6 year old uses when playing Legos.

This anime needs either to go back to a 12/13 episode half hour format or just 6 more hour length episodes just to have believable camaraderie and romance beyond a dozen words said by two different people, which should be moving as being the effect romantic situations tend to have .

This show was seriously rushed. It barely makes sense and all the foreshadowing never happened unless it was so obvious that Helen Keller could figure it out.

Sequel or a second wouldn't help, damage has been done and it is irreperable..",1334534400,3,2690,4.751605995717345
4962551,5,B0066O10AI,"I have been waiting to get my hands on the blu-ray version of this anime. It's a very good story/character development driven anime, like The Vision of Escaflowne TV series. Yeah, you have the mecha battles and etc, but you also have just as much good character development and engrossing storyline as the mecha stuff. I think that's why I enjoyed this anime as much as I did. You get the same immersive experience when the mecha battles are going on as you do when the ""other stuff outside of the mecha stuff""(the human drama) is going on. So, you get the best of both worlds.

Anyway, the blu-ray version gives you the full HD treatment. The video is presented in 16x9 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution, so if you have a nice HD TV, the visuals will be nice eye candy for you. Both the English language and Japanese language tracks are encoded in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, so you will definitely get ""theater quality"" surround sound, especially if you have a nice home theater set up. Highly recommended.",1332720000,,1005,4.583333333333333
4962552,4,B0066O10AI,"Broken Blade is an excellent anime which reminds me of Escaflowne (even some of the music is similar) with some elements of Naruto in there as well. Even though I disliked Escaflowne, this anime was still very enjoyable, the characters are far more interesting, the story while short is well told, the animation is spectacular (robots actually showing damage), and the music is some of the best I've heard from an anime. With that being said, stay away from the DUB! I'm a dub kind of guy, so I normally always watch an anime in my native language, English, and for the most part anything post-Akira have good enough dub for me. However Broken Blade is one of those rare occasions which I actually prefer the SUB over DUB, I just couldn't stand hearing Rygart sounding like a 12-year old snotty little kid, or Sigyn the Queen sounding like a tomboy. I only watch the first chapter in English, the rest I had to switch to Japanese and you will be able to tell the difference right away, the Dub just didn't put the same amount of emotions and effort the Sub did, and thus not matching their characters. Overall this was a great anime and I would recommend it to all who enjoy anime!",1331769600,,1181,4.497674418604651

4962555,5,B0066O10AI,"In the future, everyone is born with the ability to manipulate quartz. Only the degrees are supposed to vary.  This means that everything from window shades to the mechanisms powering triggered is powered by ability and the stronger a person's ability, the stronger they are in battle. Sometimes a person is born without any ability at all, and they are looked down upon by most as useless. One's value will be proven, however, as battle consumes to countries.  In a kingdom struggling to survive, four friends find themselves approaching the conflict differently. One a king, the other his wife, the third on the other side of the conflict, and the fourth once considered useless now finding the most powerful weapon on the battlefield his to command.

I really LOVE this show because it has so much to offer. It goes well beyond other mech shows, incorporating a level of detail i find refreshing. The characters are concise and the ideas are thought out, and the storyline is brilliantly detailed. It does not easily break down or descend into long bouts of melee, instead introducing characters and having them face struggles that stretch into and beyond battle.

This is not to say that the fighting in the series in not beautiful, because it is. The mechs are powered by a center-based driver tucked in what essentially amounts to the stomach, and horrible things sometimes happen to them or to foot soldiers as they struggle to stay alive. One theme that is constantly reinforced is that the defending force is at a disadvantage technology-wise and the mechs show that, with differences in their designs of functions or pilot-based response. they also have strengths and limitations, and the show focuses on those by brilliantly focusing on them in ways that does not take away from the action. It seems hard for most shows to do, but Broken Blade pulls it off time and again.

A lot of time is also devoted to the the core friendship that has developed between the four characters, each of them attending military school together but facing reality beyond the school walls. The queen and her feelings for the one who left, the friend forced to battle the other friend; there's so much detail and it never clutters the pace. Along with that is the time spent showcasing different pilots on each side, so you do not pick a side and think ""this is the good guy."" Both have their reasons for struggle, one is just being invaded. when someone dies, and they do often, there is stunning in some way because the show dedicated time to let you know them.

If you get this, I recommend BluRay because of the crisp picture and clarity. The sound is superb compared to the SD. I watched both and the difference is noticeable. that said, SD is not bad at all, looking both nice and detailed. Either is a good watch, I just recommend bluRay. A strong 5/5",1330387200,8,2849,4.710843373493976
4962556,5,B0066O10AI,even tho this was such a short anime i loved it but it left me wanting more. I love the art style and story line all around great!!!,1330300800,,132,3.75
4962557,4,B0066O10AI,"As I said this is a mech anime. In a world of mech anime its rare to see one wrapped up in just 300 min. Which isn't a problem at all for me. The animation on a technical level is excellent, with alot of detail and very well done backgrounds. The story and characters aren't anything new but at a time where alot of bland or just plain ""meh"" anime are out, its nice to see something serious without excessive fan service ( which I personally don't mind)  or cliche angry female characters. Like most reviews this is just my opinion, but I thoroughly enjoyed this series and found it a great purchase.",1329955200,3,600,4.3097345132743365
4962558,5,B0066O10AI,"What you are looking at here is such an anime. Each episode is literally a movie itself. The series was not released all at once in Japan but over many months. Very similar in that respect to Katanagatari.

How I would categorize this show is a dirty mecha. Mechs are not overly glamorized or well fashioned. Combat is brutal and they are not like others where they stand there and take punishment while looking cool. People do die and often in gory ways. While the camera cuts away on most of them, it leaves enough to the imagination where you'd know it would hurt.

The storyline itself is about an invasion based on a need for Quartz. So, in other words, resources. But there is a lot of background to the plot that may slightly confuse you if you spend too long thinking about it. Resources isn't the only reason they are invading. Most of the answers are revealed during the course of the other films. A lot of bad blood has taken place between the nations and what makes it worse is that you have generations growing up believing lies and false history spread by the governments. You'll see this many times in the story.

However, you will get to see both sides in the conflict, but it does favor the defender's position. Each of the characters involved have their own tale and despite focusing on the defenders more, you will get to see some of the other side. Enough to find characters you like on both fronts. Many backgrounds interconnect in this way.

Overall, you'll find a great series here that gives mech combat more of a gritty feel. This series does have an ending, but it is open enough that you will hope they make more in the future. Which would be a blessing to the anime world if they made more.",1325721600,86,1718,4.444444444444445

4962569,3,B0066O10AI,"I'm not normally a ""mecha fan,"" with the exception of Evangelion, Code Geass, and Gurren Lagann. I picked up Broken Blade because I thought the designs and battle animation looked promising. It's six episodes long, with each episode being longer than the norm (45 min).

***PROS***

MECH DESIGN/BATTLE ANIMATION
The mech's look great. They have a more realistic appearance than most: They're covered in dings and scrapes, and their movements give the welcome and much-needed impression of weight/gravity. The battles in the beginning are somewhat plain (focusing on familiarizing the audience with their projectile weapons, which fire steel spikes). But once they move on to close-quarters combat, the show starts to shine and flex some intensity. If you like long battles that don't start and end with a single attack, then this series is for you. These things take a beating, and the pilots must use strategy to achieve victory. The final boss battle consumes an entire episode. Thank you.

***CONS***

STORY
Everyone in this story uses a power called ""magic"" (I know, what a concept) to move all items considered technology, from toasters to robots. Our hero can't use magic (he's special), but at least they've unearthed an ancient mech that no one except our protagonist can use. He's reluctant to pilot it and doesn't want to fight in a war, as he's a pacifist at heart. Sound familiar?  Because it's the base-level theme of every popular mecha anime. The goods news is they get that cliche out of the way in the first episode and MOVE ON. He pilots it and starts kicking ass, and the story changes gears. The politics and character motivations are simple. The princess makes some pathetic attempts at winning the heart and mind of a captive enemy by having sexy slumber parties, and the bonds between characters remain surprisingly thin. It's not bad, but it's not good either.

LENGTH
This story could be told in two hours (instead of six). Otherwise, it needs to be an entire 26-episode series, wherein they could fully develop the characters, explore the world of nations they've created, and let their story mean more than it does.

VOICES
The main character looks to be about 18, but his voice actor (English dub) sounds 10. It's jarring and takes a while to . . . no, you never get used to it.

This is a decent mecha anime. The combat is fresh and rewarding. There are some intense battles and a mildly entertaining story. There just needed to be either more or less. What they have here is adequate. Watch first, before you buy.

I'm a writer and animator, so I'm constantly pouring through stacks of anime looking for gems of inspiration. If you find this review helpful, or our taste seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer straight.",1380153600,3,2757,4.8241525423728815

4962571,1,B0066O10AI,"how can someone justify charging $40 for 6 episodes of the most convoluted crap I have ever watched in my life. I consider myself a person who will give just about any anime a try. mecha/fantasy being one of my favorite genres in anime. the story here was not spectacular nor was it even close to keeping me captivated. It jumped from plot point to alternate plot point so much I felt as if I were watching a hyper active group of people go nuts on me through the tv screen. There was no time to even grow any sort of sentimental attachment or liking of ANY of the characters in the story because things were paced SO poorly! Art wise I was less than impressed. The cover art made this out to be something beautiful and tragic promising something fun and action packed. What I got was a pretty cover with no innards. How frustrating!!! Where has the taste gone? Is anime dead? I miss the days where story still mattered.

I am an avid collector of anime and after watching this I no longer feel the same passion or regard for this hobby which I have been pursuing since I was but a teenager. I find myself going back to old school classics like Neon Evangelion and Akira. At least as insane as the plots were for these sci-fi animes they for the most part held my interest and challenged my attention span. Broken Blade could not even keep me awake. I would recommend this anime to someone who has trouble sleeping. This anime is guaranteed to knock you out cold. If you make it to the end like I somehow managed to do the ending will absolutely PISS YOU OFF. One commenter stated that the ending left it open for future episodes.

4962579,2,B0066O10AI,"Badly drawn and animated in many parts, with pedestrian to lousy voice acting; a gem of a story destroyed by shoddy workmanship.

The sub-title translation isn't great either.

For example, in the first episode, the display screen in the ancient golem was used to give the audience some background info/story: the new operator had no skill, it knows it was in a dangerous environment, etc.  Those are the reason why the machine activates on its own, yet none of that was translated, making the action random instead of logical.  (e.g. With the operator's improving skills, it has fewer reason to take over as time goes on.)

Even more importantly, when the camera panned over the people outside (including the king), the system marked them as unknown living organisms.  That's a very critical detail to the story, and of course it was not translated.  That's not entirely the translation team's fault; the director choose to not even linger two seconds on that, so even people familiar with Japanese may miss it--I only knew to look for it because I've came across the manga before.

4962581,4,B0066O10AI,"This review is honestly very hard for me to write, but I'm going to attempt to do so anyways. Why? A straight up answer would be that I simply feel compelled show my support for this franchise. In this day and age it's VERY IMPORTANT to support the anime and manga franchises that one enjoys or loves in all ways possible. Every act in support of your favorite products counts. (More then you may realize.) In this day and age any and all franchises-no matter how good, awesome, emotional, or (in rare cases) successful they may appear to be- are ALWAYS facing the risk of being discontinued or put on a permanent hiatus. And as one of my favorite pass-times I've decided to do anything and everything in my power to prevent that outcome to as many of my favorite shows as possible.

Anyways...This isn't a pro-Activism rant. This is a review. So now that I've said my inspirational little quibble; let's actually move on to the review, shall we?

Furthermore...I apologize. But there is actually a few more (Albeit slightly more relevant.) messages that must be stated before we move on to the actual ""review."" of this product. To start it off, although this is officially a review, there is also quite a bit of a personal commentary involved. I feel very deeply about this product and that shows in my reviews. Additionally, in my unorthodox review methods I don't just stick to the anime I'm supposed to be reviewing. I guess the best way to put it is that I'll write about NOT just what I like about THIS anime, but I'll write about what I look for and love about anime (personally) in general and how this show succeeds in the aspects I look for in my shows. Finally I may go off topic a little bit, but please keep in mind, again, I feel strongly about the products I review. With these three facts established, let's move on.

I must be honest with you fellow potential fans and existing fans; with this specific product I've truthfully messed up. How? Well I've broken my own personal sacred rule of fiction- which is one must not expose oneself to other formats of the story until the story is completed or at least semi-completed in the format I first started. (For those that need further iteration of what I mean by ""semi-completed"" and ""completed"". I mean Semi-Completed as, for example, a specific movie, season, novel, arc OR perhaps some other self contained or [in other cases] nearly self-contained part[s] of a story which is completed within a story in that particular format. Furthermore, in the case of THIS specific story, nearly the entire story currently available to the public [About ten out of the Eleven Volumes] has been adapted into its proposed anime/movie format. Likewise, completed means that the story is literally 'completed' in the particular format. There is more to say about this, however I don't want to give this information away so quickly...Read on for further explanation.)

The first part of my review (Mainly the part regarding my personal sacred rule of fiction.) may have left you a bit bewildered; so please let me elaborate on this key bit because this ties directly back into the rest of my review. This may be a bit of a spoiler, but as a reviewer I feel I must state it and you, as the consumer, must know...(And please keep in mind, it's really not necessarily a BAD thing either. In fact there are two very positive ideas that can be drawn from this...Which I will go into detail later in the review.) This show has tragically been cut short. There is, quite literally, no closure at the end of this show. I mean, the events of the story proceed logically and nothing is too tragic in terms of shock value of the actual cliff hanger. However, I was left feeling so desperate that I raced ahead and read the entire 57 chapters over a six hour period.

Anyways, so I basically watched this entire series than rushed and read the manga at a time when I shouldn't have done so. According to my rule, I should have waited for the manga AND/OR anime version of this story to be completed BEFORE I rushed to read it. You may be thinking that one could should simply stop between certain chapters. And this is true to some extent. However, in this specific case I underestimated just HOW interconnected this story would be. Additionally I made the mistake of assuming, from past experience with similar types of stories from another format, [books and anime] that this story's chapters wouldn't be as interconnected as they actually where. I ALSO made the mistake of underestimating the pace by which the story would progress. Lastly, I made the mistake of, as mentioned earlier, of not stopping at an appropriate point. (Which is partially why the rule exists in the FIRST place...because I can't stop myself!)

You see, although I've been an avid reader of fiction as well as an anime fan my entire life... I'm relatively new to manga. Again, I underestimated just how linear and interconnected this story would be as well as the speed by which the story would progress. There is, quite literally, no break in this entire story. NOTHING slows down. This, in most cases, is a GOOD thing. No I'm wrong, this is a GREAT thing. I'm just so used to filler arcs g-d d****t! And if there aren't any filler arcs I'm used to the anime FORCING the audience to stop at certain points in the story! (So I went from both to neither.) Nevertheless, I should have foreseen this and I, as a result, may have tainted my view of this product. (Which is the second and primary reason the rules exists.) If I had waited, I could have better judged each product individually as well as prevented any potential bias by looking at each product individually. I will try as hard as I can to remain unbiased, however certain perceptions of the subconscious have been permanently altered...Which pretty much means that I agree with (liked) the manga execution (version) of the story more than I agree (liked) with the anime execution (version) of it. Looking back though, I can still recall LOVING the anime version of the story when I first saw it. And thus there are conflicting feelings as a result and this may cause me to -unfairly- degrade this product even though it may be perfect fine to possible future fans.

Earlier I said two things could be drawn from a cliffhanger ending and I will say those now. First, a cliffhanger ending means that the creators of the story and/or show INTEND to continue the actual story. Secondly, and just as importantly, this means that there IS LIKELY MORE to the initial story. Remember, sometimes the desire to artificially continue a story is bad for the story. However, in this case it's the opposite. There was TOO MUCH to put in these movies and so they decided they needed more. However, this also works as a test to see if continuing this show is even worth the company's time. So SUPPORT THIS SHOW!

But what about the actual show?

Oh boy, what ISN'T there about the actual show?

Broken Blade: The Complete Collection is a six-part adaptation of the first ten volumes (50ish of 57 chapters.) of the manga of the same name, Broken Blade. However... having experienced both, the story is so good that I felt compelled to purchase this set (As the manga isn't available in America except through fan subs.) in order to support this franchise. I HIGHLY recommend this series to anybody and everybody. This ""series"", however, is only six episodes. But the run-time for each episode is around two and half times the length of a normal TV series episode. (So around 55 minutes per episode!) Looking back, I like this approach better overall for this type of no-filler, more action type of story. These ""episodes"" do actually run and feel like that of which they where advertised, as movies. (If not for the weird pacing of each part! I mean, it worked in the manga but...) and because of this the story progresses non stop similar to the way it does in the manga.

Speaking of the story, this is as good as it gets. Literally, this could be straight from a NY Times bestselling novel. This is also officially my new all-time favorite Mecha. Granted I haven't seen/read many Mecha anime/mangas. However I have read many similar works of American fiction that ARE similar. (Well, actually not really but I HAVE read different works of fiction that each contain different elements of this story.) Also, I've done a fair amount of research and found that there isn't really anything quite like Broken Blade IN THE MANGA WORLD, either. You see, what makes this story so unique is that this story utilizes Mechas [a mostly futuristic conception] yet takes place in a fantasy world. Again, another minor minor spoiler here...but the entire premise of the technology isn't steam or metal, but quartz. (Crystals!) Humans that reside in this fantasy world can manipulate Quartz and give it commands. (Such as levitating it or emitting light from it.) They call this ""magic"" (Clever name, huh?) And through the use of ligaments (Quartz tools that let someone project their ""magic"" more powerfully.) can even gain control weaponry ranging of quartz-made pistols all the way to Mechas. So this is essentially a successful fantasy/science fiction hybrid.

It gets better.

You see this show is somewhat along the same lines as Black Lagoon, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, and Deadman Wonderland (Three of my all time favorite post-childhood Anime.) and I happen to like these story's approaches much better than most anime these days. (Though Broken Blade not QUITE one the same level as these other three.) They all are so different in every other aspect, but their original idea for the protagonist remains the same. You take a NORMAL person (Though in Broken Blade, the creators of this story cleverly made a mostly normal yet still slightly speical character.) whom fate has chewed, spit out, and left for the crows. Yet these characters still rise above and beyond the occasion. The protagonists in all four of these series are presented as NORMAL people whom do EXTRA-ORDINARY things. And even if they are already extra ordinary side characters, all characters in all four series are presented to be at least somewhat relatable. For this show, I KNOW the reason why the certain sides are fighting against each other. I can relate to all the characters at least somewhat. So basically no one is simply doing what they are doing simply for the sake of doing it. ESPECIALLY the main character, Rygart. (Though he wasn't kidnapped, brainwashed, or framed and isn't completely helpless like in the other three show's protagonists.) however I'll let you watch the show to learn about him. No spoilers here. It was a great pleasure of mine to see (especially) Rygart and a certain side character's development.

I believe I touched upon this in my other review for Deadman Wonderland. However, although relatability is SO important to me, there's more to it. Dragonball Z is the antithesis of what I believe for characters and yet, **** man I enjoyed the H*** out of it. No, not only do the characters have to be relatable but also appealing. And let me tell you the characters in this series are -very- appealing. [And not in that way either.] In fact, Id say this is the first series where I have no favorite character...I enjoyed every single one equally. Everyone played their parts perfectly. And, though it's not overkill, there is plenty of [more subtle yet still there] fan service as well. (Though there is still one or two out-of-place jokes.) Though, I kinda felt that the character descriptions, appearances, dialogue, and voices didn't quite match up however this was easily overlooked.

On top of everything, the animation quality is fantastic. Lots of scenery shots that look surprisingly good in high quality. This is a relatively new anime (2011!) and thus the animation is great. I don't want to get into the nitty gritty details of the actual fight scenes as I want to save those to learn those for yourself later on when you watch it, but this show doesn't shy away from its fair share of gore, violence, cursing, and drama. I will say this one thing though-You will never see Mecha fighting this good. This isn't your normal standard light show. The combat isn't on as big of a scale either so you are going to feel as close as you are ever going to get in a mecha show. Lastly the Mechas themselves look ******* sick. Prepare for a blast of awesomeness.

Also the characters all look and feel their parts. (While still looking great overall.) In addition to the great cinematography and camera work. (I had no trouble following the scenes [most notably the fights] whatsoever.) Finally, the dub itself was pretty good. I'd give the dub a B+. To me, as long as voices don't sound OFF they are fine. Nothing has to be too elegant, unique, or fancy for me in terms of dubs. I haven't had the chance to watch the subbed version but I assume it's good. (Sub voices are usually are pretty good.)

My conclusion is to look up some clips online of the fight scenes and the characters. (With their respective dubs.) I absolutely LOVED this story, but others may find it mediocre and are simply hungry for action. Again, this isn't your standard mass scale outer space light show. However I personally feel it's even better than that. If you watch an entire episode you'll already have watched a good portion of it so I don't recommend trying it like that. However whatever the case, you will NOT make a bad purchase with this one. This show is 4/5 stars  and is a show worthy of being in YOUR collection! (Not to mention every purchase improves the likelihood a sequel will be made!)",1348704000,6,13654,4.701086956521739
4962582,5,B0066O10AI,"I have read that this does not cover the entire series and I am not sure whether more will be made to cover the rest but for the price, this is worth it. I highly recommend. It has a great story and the dubbing is well done. For any fans of action and/or mecha anime, this is a must. The series is very gritty and real, not overly glamorized or fake looking. The battle scenes are intense and will keep you at the edge of your seat. It does star off slightly slow but by the second mini movie and onwards it goes barreling through with little filler or anything to get in the way of the main plot. Yes, the ending is left open and I'm unsure of anymore on the horizon but if you truly wish to see the rest, then get the manga. No matter what, this is a must for any mecha/action anime fan.",1346371200,3,789,4.0
4962583,5,B0066O10AI,For anyone out their who wished their was a mechwarrior style movie out their look know further then this film collection. I really enjoyed this 6 part movie their is good story good charactor development the story starts with a boy named rygod he gets summoned by the king of his nation to pilot a new mecha that he uncovers but it also turns out that he and the king and queen are good friends. One thing i would like to say is that i'am so glad that hollywood is not the only choice for movie making. The japanese film industy and the indepentent film industies can also make really good films as well. through it seems that indie films have gotten more popular it would be nice to see more people give them a chance.

4962586,3,B0066O10AI,"For those who aren't in the know, this series of animated ""films"" (all of which, as Sentai Filmworks is doing their best to assure you, are included herein) is based upon an ongoing comic series which is probably going to wind up being ""cancelled"" before it can ever find its way to either an appropriate or satisfactory (what satisfies the critic rarely sits with the fan, and vice-versa) ending.

Just in case I didn't already scare you off with the title, this review itself essentially amounts to an unapologetic spoiling of Broken Blade's (non-)ending since I can easily imagine how one might feel cheated after purchasing this ""complete collection"" without fully understanding its nature. Then again, since this set has already dropped down to nearly half its MSRP a mere two months after release (that is as of 20120521) perhaps the only thing left for a perspective buyer to consider is whether or not you'll feel like you've wasted your time. Hopefully I can help you make that determination.

As a reader though not necessarily fan of the ridiculously slow-paced original manga, I had hoped that this series of films would capitalize on the potential I'd seen in the franchise by first heading in a different direction, and then ultimately wrapping up somewhere in the vicinity of the final installment's credits. On the first count I was almost satisfied since this adaptation is at least better than the mediocre manga, but as a result of nobody from the original author on up to the producers being willing to go in a completely different direction from that of the source material I knew my hopes would be dashed about halfway through.

Interestingly enough, despite a multi-year lead (and further exhibiting the original author's incompetence) the events in the manga essentially (the exact timeline fails me, but at the least planning for the anime preceded the publication of numerous chapters of manga) fell behind those of the anime. Since no one would bother reading what they could watch instead this inspired the (editor to put a gun to the head of the) author to go in a different direction with the equivalent events in the manga, with the end result being better. For the manga.

Ultimately one can choose to consider this anime one of two ways. As a slightly above average stand-alone product that more or less covers one period of a war between nations in its entirety while leaving the final outcome undecided, or as what at best is something that needs but is unlikely to receive a sequel series, and at worst just might be a roughly 6 hour promo for the sub-par manga series. I'm of the opinion that the majority of anime series adapted from another medium fall under that last dubious distinction, but for whatever it's worth the current state of mecha anime (North American availability in particular) is so abysmal that this is actually one of the best examples the genre currently has to offer on Blu-Ray.

In conclusion I would say that if you're the type of person (as I am) to get pissed off at ""the end"" endings then the fact that this one ends that way is probably going to spoil the whole thing for you and make you wish you'd watched something else. For you I'd recommend ""Linebarrels of Iron""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linebarrels-of-Iron-The-Complete-Series-Seasons-1-2-and-OVA/dp/B004GZZH8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linebarrels of Iron: The Complete Series (Seasons 1, 2 and OVA)</a>&nbsp;if only because it's a ""real"" complete series (not to mention for less than this one) that had a real ending (or as real as it ever gets when it comes to mecha...). Alas that the series doesn't have a ""real"" Blu-Ray version, but precisely because it doesn't do Amazon any good for me to say so that's just one more reason to watch it for free/through Hulu (wasn't it?) via Funimation's website like I did. Otherwise, if I haven't talked you out of Broken Blade yet then you just might get something out of it. As I said in the title it certainly had gorgeous animation if nothing else, and every once in a while it's worth watching something with a unsatisfying plot just for the sake of appreciating its aesthetic qualities. Then again if you can make sense of just which the hell version available here on Amazon is which (I've just linked the first thing that came up) you'd still probably be better off watching something like Gurren Lagann&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gurren-Lagann-Complete-Collection-Anime-Legends/dp/B003P3PQNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gurren Lagann: Complete Collection (Anime Legends)</a>, ESPECIALLY if you've seen it before.",1337558400,12,4685,5.183619550858652
