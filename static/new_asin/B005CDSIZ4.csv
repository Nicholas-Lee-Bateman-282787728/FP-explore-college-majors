4652592,5,B005CDSIZ4,"I was at this game and it was the most memorable day ever as a sports fan.  If you like Jeter or like the Yankees and didn't get to see this momentous game, buy this DVD!  Its also got interviews of Jeter, and you can pick whether to listen to the TV or Radio announcers.

Great item for your DVD collection!  I wish it was available in Blu-Ray!",1332720000,4,345,4.029411764705882
4652593,5,B005CDSIZ4,"If you're a true Yankee fan or a Jeter fan you need this DVD. It is the entire game when Jeter hit his 3000 homerun and it also has his post game interview and allows your to select TV commentary or Radio commentary. It is an incredible piece of history that will allow you to watch it over and over again on your demand. Being in New York at a weeding when this happened I was unable to see the game, now I can watch it when ever I choose! Absolutely a great buy! Completely worth it!",1325980800,9,485,4.010309278350515
4652594,5,B005CDSIZ4,"Simply a must-own for any New York Yankee fan and especially, any Derek Jeter fan. Under pressure filled situations, Derek's ability to take his game to the next level is truly inspiring and his performance on this day was absolutely legendary.",1325462400,4,244,4.975609756097561
4652595,5,B005CDSIZ4,I was fortunate enough to attend this game. I am originally from New York and have relocated to Georgia and visited New York this past July. I had tickets to the game the night before but it was rained out. The following morning I got 3 bleacher tickets on StubHub and raced back to Yankee Stadium. We arrived just as Jeter was having his first at bat in the bottom of the first. The 3000th hit landed just two sections away from us and the young man who caught it worked in my hometown. The crowd was electric and the Jeter chants nearly deafening. It was one of the most exciting days of my life. This dvd captures the excitement and I love the feature of being able to listen to John Sterling's radio call while watching the game. This dvd is the next best thing to being there.,1318636800,15,781,4.248322147651007
4652596,5,B005CDSIZ4,"I have been a New York Yankees fan for about 35 years. I have been following Derek Jeter's career since 1998. I have seen many of the milestones and highlights of his  career. Every years I make the trek to Yankee Stadium to see my beloved Yankees play. However, this year there were things going on in my life, and I did not make it to any of the games nor did I see the game he got hit #3000. SO I purchased this game and was able to see DJ go 5-5 on that special day. The dvd also contains the press conference after the game, highlights of Jeter's career, including his first Major league home run, and his first hit. I would recommend this dvd for New York Yankees' fan, and especially Derek Jeter fans, since this was a history making game. When Jeter is inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, you will a dvd of this game as a keepsake.",1318032000,10,844,4.146341463414634

4652601,5,B005CDSIZ4,"Hubby received this as a father's day gift from our son.  He loves it. We were watching the game Jeter hit that 3,000th hit, we were buggin!!

Derek Jeter is all world, great old school classic ball player and a class act.  Watching him play his last All Star game was so cool especially since we've been watching him since day one as a Yankee!

Thanks for the memories and the World Series Championships Jeter!!!!",1405641600,,414,4.48
4652602,5,B005CDSIZ4,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was the same one that HBO (Sorry to mention a another DVD). And this was a DVD that brought you very surface view through the Great Derek Jeter's Yankee history. Sadly to say it was NOT the video that HBO did on his 3000K. Amazon has always been great when it comes to the movies a general search will find. This one however did not deliver all the tension and thrills that brought Derek Jeter to that Amazing Milestone. The one I was looking for was run through Legends & legacies which is a HBO series. To this day I have not found the film I'm looking for but I will keep trying. The one purchased here is a very good video as they take to through the entire game, including the 3000K. HBO brought you through ALL the Tension and Drama that led to that Historic Game. I would recommend buying this DVD as it's not all that expected and it does have a bonus mode where you get to see many of the Great Accomplishments of this Outstanding player.",1398816000,,982,4.2287234042553195
4652603,5,B005CDSIZ4,"Great to have the option of either the Yankees radio broadcast or the YES Network broadcast on this DVD.  The game follows the YES Network broadcast, but it's nice to hear the radio voice of the Yankees - John Sterling - on this momentous occasion.  Menu also makes it easy to skip to the various innings if you want.  DVD also has some bonus material of Jeter's post game press conference and some of his milestone hits.  Amazing game by a baseball icon.",1392336000,,455,4.445783132530121
4652604,5,B005CDSIZ4,I got this for my dad because he loves the yankees. It came pretty fast in the mail and it is a great dvd.,1372291200,,106,3.4583333333333335
4652605,5,B005CDSIZ4,I was watching this game and had just as much anticipation as the crowd at Yankee Stadium.  I was so excited when he got the 1st hit to make it 2999 and then the Homerun was just an unbelievable moment that all I could do was squeal and clap and yell and then for some reason there were tears.  Maybe it was the fact that no one else on the Yankees had ever achieved 3000 hits before.  I have yet to watch the video with the radio call and I'm sure it was just as exciting for them as it was for the tv announcers.  Great accomplishment for a great player!!!  Will play this game for years to come!,1367539200,,598,3.991596638655462
4652606,5,B005CDSIZ4,"What a great human, baseball player, role model. The list goes on. A great time in a great baseball player, great Yankees career. So many people put this guy on such high pedestal, yet he just keeps raising the bar himself. Gotta love it,,",1358294400,,239,4.454545454545454
