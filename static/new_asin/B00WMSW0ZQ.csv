8713804,2,B00WMSW0ZQ,"With HoC I thought I'd get an edgier more honest and more detailed West Wing. Instead what I got is the ridiculous plot of a Vice President running around murdering Congressmen and journalists while stopping every once in a while to give his pontificating advice direct to the viewer. I'm as cynical as it gets when it comes to government, but the plot is just ridiculous.",1477872000,,372,4.651515151515151
8713805,3,B00WMSW0ZQ,sorry I bought the Blu-ray.,1476835200,,27,4.6
8713806,5,B00WMSW0ZQ,"I have never been more involved with a television series. We have all four seasons and it only gets better. They seem to be a combination of the Clintons and the Cheneys. We thought The West Wing was powerful, which it is; but this holds back nothing. Sometimes I see Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon in Spacey when he lets loose. One huge disappointment: the packaging. They're packaged in tight cardboard slots which makes it difficult to get them out. A couple of the discs were actually glued into the packaging (fortunately, it was sticky on the top of the disc and not where the laser plays the show. Whoever came up with this design should be fired.) I believe this is the true picture of politics/Washington behind the scenes. A shadowy and corrupt world for power and self-advantage. Can't recommend it too much!",1476403200,,821,4.708333333333333
