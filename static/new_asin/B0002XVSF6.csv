8034404,5,B0002XVSF6,"Simply put, this is an outstanding introductory overview of skyscrapers covering their history, functions, symbolism, design, and construction.  They can't go into much depth in less than an hour, but they still manage to cover enough ground (pun intended) to make this documentary very worthwhile.  Highly recommended for the whole family.  I really enjoyed this, and will be watching it again.",1337817600,2,395,5.442622950819672
8034405,5,B0002XVSF6,"Skyscrapers is the fifth and final episode in the Building Big series by David Macaulay. The first four episodes cover Bridges, Tunnels, Dams, and Domes, all structures that people have known for centuries. Skyscrapers may have their roots in the towers of Italy, but they have reached their height of popularity in the last 150 years. Early skyscrapers were of stone, but steel and elevators made the hundred story and taller glass and steel boxes possible. Skyscrapers got their big boost in Chicago in the last 19th Century but it was the small island of Manhattan that needed them most. Today some of the most impressive towers are built in Asia but the quest for  the tallest structure drives the skyline ever higher. Macaulay always throws in a little drama and in this episode discusses collapses and fires. With new technology in the future, the sky is the limit.",1282694400,6,871,4.845637583892618
