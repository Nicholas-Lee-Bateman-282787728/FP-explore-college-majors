8285933,1,B000X9LSB8,"After watching Dr. Walter Veith, I became interested in the workings of various religions, cults and secret societies.  So I purchased both kingdom of the cults dvd's and found them very lame by comparison.  They are older productions and provide little hard evidence for the statements made in the interviews.  No real revelation of anything useful here.",1387238400,,355,5.192982456140351
8285934,1,B000X9LSB8,I was very disappointed because i thought it was a realistic documentary with real footage but it was more of a guy rambling on and on with a lot of still photography. I am a documentary addict and this was not up to standard. i don't recommend it to anyone if you are used to the National geographic and History channel programs. It is no where near any of those quality shows.,1250899200,4,378,4.263888888888889
8285935,5,B000X9LSB8,"I ordered this DVD instead of the book for immediate education on cults.
The information is focused on a few religious type organizations.
These groups may be controlling but not to the extent of leading people to take the life of themselves or others.

There are also unknown groups and groups that have rituals involving harm to others and another DVD should be produced to inform us of how to protect our love ones from these groups as well.

It stresses that since you can not stop a friend or family member from joining or remaining with a group if in their mind that they honestly feel that this is the life that they desire.

You will learn how to stay in contact with them and remind them that that are also loved by you no matter what their decision and are welcome to come home anytime.",1211673600,4,796,4.401360544217687
