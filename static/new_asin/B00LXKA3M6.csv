8668910,5,B00LXKA3M6,"I love this DVD! The Yoga of Food focuses on the relationship between your body and your mind. Josie erases the definition of self we have created by society and expresses the importance of self acceptance.  This DVD connects the practice of yoga and one's ability to listen to your body's physical responses. This awareness allows you to make positive food choices and live a health, less stressful lifestyle. Josie guides you through every pose with detailed instructions as if she was standing in front of your yoga mat.
I believe when practicing yoga the connection between your teacher and yourself is important.  Josie is truly inspirational.
This DVD is my favorite way to begin my day.",1432684800,3,693,4.914529914529915

8668912,5,B00LXKA3M6,"Josie's approach to yoga and food is unlike anything I've experienced.  I am a beginner with yoga, and I have discovered that my emotions have been locked inside--possibly for many years.  When I do yoga with Josie, I often begin to cry about halfway through the practice--and I am not even sure why--as if my body were being freed from the pain of my past.  I contacted Josie about this, and she reassured me that this is often what happens with beginining practice... so I continue to practice, and I continue to cry.  But each time, the crying moves me to a new space--I feel more peaceful, relaxed, free... It gives me a new outlook on life, and I am certain that I am getting healthier both physically and emotionally.  It's an extraordinary yoga DVD made by an extraordinary teacher, and I am so grateful to Josie for the gift of her wisdom, beauty, and grace...",1425081600,5,868,4.538461538461538
8668913,5,B00LXKA3M6,"After years of struggling with body issues and low self-esteem, I discovered this DVD!!!  I can't describe how much it's helped me rebuild confidence in my ability to listen to my own body's wisdom as well as take my yoga practice in directions I hadn't previously imagined.  I've been a yo-yo dieter for years and have read just about every self-help book on the market.  Josie's DVD taught me how much I've wasted my time looking for the right fix.  Now I know that healing starts with small but important lifestyle changes.  Josie presents these life-changing alternatives with compassion and clarity.  I finally feel empowered to make lasting changes to both my physical and emotional life.  In the DVD, Josie seamlessly connects the physical practice of yoga with developing new attitudes about body and health.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to deepen their yoga practice and bring balance into their relationship with food!",1419724800,5,948,4.993630573248407
8668914,5,B00LXKA3M6,"Yoga teacher Josie Kramer brings genuine, hard-won knowledge to this super-important subject, sharing insights from Yoga, neuroscience, psychology and nutrition to guide practitioners into a more balanced and mindful relationship to food. Rather than turning to short-fix diets as a way of coping with our food-compulsions, we need to do the serious work of fundamentally changing our relationship to what and how we eat. Josie offers a viable framework within which to do just that, offering gentle and skillful guidance in a series of practices and talks. Very worthwhile DVD!!!",1409529600,5,580,5.455555555555556
8668915,5,B00LXKA3M6,"Josie Kramer is an incredible teacher and human being who is all heart. Her yoga classes have shaped me into being a more conscious and loving person who can deal with life's stresses in a more peaceful and humble way. You will be blessed by this DVD in more ways then you know. She takes you through a beautiful yoga practice and while your doing that, gifts you with the knowledge and understanding you need in order to treat your body with love and respect. Because what we eat is who we are! So it is a double whammy, you get a yoga practice you can play over and over again, and knowledge and understanding around food that you will want to hear more then once to digest. It is great for all levels of yoga, and you will want to buy one for everyone in your circle.",1408924800,5,770,4.20945945945946
8668916,5,B00LXKA3M6,"REVIEW OF MY JOURNEY WITH JOSIE KRAMER AND ""THE YOGA OF FOOD"" DVD

I consider myself fortunate to have discovered my yoga teacher,  Josie Kramer, from the best perspective.  I was an absolute
beginner, had suffered a back injury, and was necessarily  experimenting with multiple teachers to see what classes would
stretch and heal me best.  Of course there was an urgency to  this process because I had been told by doctors/chiropractors
that stretching, and in particular yoga, was what I needed to  regain wholeness of motion.  So the search was on!

While I'm delighted to report that I found a number of fine yoga instructors in southern California, one teacher in particular,
Josie Kramer, consistently stood out from the rest and here's  why.  Josie presents a sensitive progression through the poses
that enables beginners and even injured students, like I was, to find their way into healing positions that one could not simply
go to  without following her insightful sequence of movement.  This is consistently demonstrated class after class and I've
come to the conclusion that Josie Kramer has a true gift of perception and understanding where the healing power of yoga is
concerned. Obviously, this superior quality instruction was exactly what I  needed and led me to choose Josie and my yoga
teacher.  My search was over, but there's more!

I've continued to follow Josies' instruction, and have improved enough to become less focused on my injury, and I've now
become increasingly aware of the whole package Josie offer's with  her teaching.  She has an inspiring message of optimism,
hope and healing which she continually shares throughout class. Josie has an uncanny sense of where one's mind might be
wandering during each pose and shares insightful suggestions of where one might choose to focus their thoughts instead at those times.  I find this kind of healing to be absolutely consciousness elevating which leads to a kind of spiritual
healing that just  makes you feel better for giving yourself the gift of participating in her yoga class! On top of that, as an
integrative nutritionist, Josie also offers wonderful insights  about people's relationship to food and their eating habits.  I
now believe Josie Kramer to be one of our leading holistic life  coaches who simply incorporates her brilliant practice of yoga
as the base of her program.  As you can see, there are many reasons why I am truly grateful to have found her!

I am particularly grateful to have Josies' new DVD, ""The Yoga of  Food"".  All aspects of Josies' program are contained on
the DVD, making it much more than just another yoga workout DVD. Approximately 2hrs. 40mins., it provides numerous excellent yoga practice sequences, strewn with multiple spiritually healing  meditations and a plethora of valuable insights concerning
appetite, food choices and eating habits. It is full of  enlightening information for healthy living, being and thought
all vitally connected to your practice of yoga.  Available to be done in sections, do as much as you choose of this valuable  journey with Josie at any given time.

I often need to be away from southern California, so I'm very thankful to know that while on the road I'm still able to
continue practicing with Josie.  The DVD is very handy to pop into a player and do as much as you choose at home or on the
road.  It makes me happy to share the news that you can now  discover Josie's program too, without having to be at her
studio!  Josie Kramer's holistic approach to body, mind and  spirit through yoga makes this DVD a treasure worth far more
than the moderate price of 24.95!  I strongly recommend having  your ""The Yoga of Food"" DVD with you wherever you go!",1407628800,5,3715,4.902086677367576
8668917,5,B00LXKA3M6,"I loved this DVD. The yoga poses are beautifully done. I have never seen them done with so much grace and fluidity, so closely resembling dance. The information about food and eating disorders is priceless. There is a lot of information and wisdom about food and eating choices that is presented in a way that is easy to take in. Her voice is calm and clear. This is a DVD to watch on a regular basis, for the wonderful yoga classes provided and for the lectures about healthy food and healthy eating. This is a Teacher who walks her talk. It is my goal to make this DVD a part of my personal yoga practice and to learn and use the information offered here about healthy eating. With all the temptations, chaos and confusion in the world about food and diet, it is refreshing to hear this clear and informed voice pointing the way out of the jungle in a simple and concise way that gives me hope. Like all Masters, she makes a complicated subject appear easy. Thank you, Josie, for sharing your knowledge, wisdom and radiant light.",1407628800,6,1031,4.4603174603174605
8668918,5,B00LXKA3M6,"I absolutely loved this DVD.  Combining yoga with the principals of healthy eating, Josie directs viewers to deepen their awareness of themselves through yoga while encouraging them to listen to their own bodies as the authority on the healthiest approach to eating.  This DVD also talks about and exposes the issues with our society's unhealthy focus on being extremely thin and unsafe dieting.  It has really helped me to take a step back, de-stress, and listen to my body as I plan my meals throughout the week.  The yoga practice itself is great for all levels and there are some awesome meditation exercises which have helped me greatly as well!",1407110400,6,650,4.881818181818182
