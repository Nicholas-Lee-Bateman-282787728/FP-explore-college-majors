7816879,5,6301930606,"Truffaut really understood how a young person can make bad choices, with consequences far beyond what they can see.  You might find it depressing, but it is really great film making - if you can stomach it.  And it is distressingly realistic - nothing progresses, there is no resolution, nothing is even learned.  The girl comes from a poor background, is obviously unloved, and she is completely without the resources to reflect on her actions and choices.  She steals little things and is hungry for life, always on the edge of getting into real trouble.  She leaves home and finds a good situation, but soon opts out to pursue her dreams with a young boy who is the same as her.  From a prank with a grenade, everything goes downhill from there.  Her life falls apart.

This is a moving film.  You empathize with the girl, hope and despair for her, in one of Charlotte Gainesbourg's first starring roles.  In a spectacularly charismatic performance that is not in the slightest sentimental, she is absolutely convincing.  This is based on a sketch written by Truffaut, which he would have filmed had he not died suddenly.  Recommended warmly.",1454025600,,1145,4.785714285714286
7816880,5,6301930606,"A great movie with subtitles. It has a good story line, a good plot, and wonderful characters. Charlotte Gainsbourg was a great child star and The Little Thief was one of her most popular movies. Also check out The Cement Garden and L'Effrontee.",1387497600,,245,4.72093023255814
7816881,5,6301930606,"Directed by Claude Miller but based upon an unfinished script by the Great Francois Truffaut tragically because Truffaut died before he could direct it himself. I was 11 when I saw it on a subtitled VHS copy and thus the first time I fell in love with Charlotte Gainsbourg who plays the central character Janine Castang and is so great and lovely in the film she was nominated for a Caesar Award For Best Actress and at just 15-16 years old can't seem to understand why this film is not available on DVD. It is a great cinematic piece that shows an important lost period of Post World War II French History, with every scene of Art Direction authentic. The story is great. Charlotte plays a bored under privileged and love starved pre-teen, about the same as I was when I saw it, who resorts to stealing and living her life through the Films playing at the local Cinema. Who can't relate to her? She is alone, I.e. living with Aunt and Uncles who treat her just as such, distant relatives. After many times of being caught stealing she is sent away to become a live in maid for priggish rich folks. Until an older gentleman Professor shows an interest in her disguised as love. And she see's the relationship this way from all the love she learnt from the many story book films she yearned to one day live out. I think there is an after love scene which shows her topless for a few seconds, but by no means perverse nor sexual, just truthful. After which she realizes this man is not interested in giving her the love she craves and deserves. After many painstaking heart blows she begins to grow into her own reality and finds what she so much deservingly and UNKNOWINGLY has  been missing through her adolescent search for love and acceptance. A very uplifting film. And way worth putting out an Official DVD version in honor of at least Francois Truffaut's last attempt at his grand story telling.",1384300800,,1900,4.523255813953488
7816882,4,6301930606,"Pitifully the death came for him, leaving so this project, unfinished. Claude Miller decided to assume the challenge to materialize the script and filmed this poignant story.

Maybe the film has notorious lows; its poetic inspiration does not reach a continuous development and demerits the final result.

It is absolutely necessary to watch previously 400 blows, because the approach is strongly enriched and supported by this vision.

I guess Truffaut intended to return the departure point and so to draw the complete circle. Only under this perspective this film will be appreciated in its total dimension.",1137974400,,610,5.333333333333333
7816883,5,6301930606,"Truffaut's interesting look at a girl coming of age in the year 1950. She is 16, from a poor family (her mother has run off to Italy leaving her with an aunt and uncle to raise her), and she involves herself in petty thievery to get the things she dreams about from seeing them in the movies. She is in a big hurry to grow up, especially sexually. She becomes a maid and starts an affair with a much older married man; she also meets a boy closer to her own age and starts a relationship with him, too. Both men end up deserting her, the boy after she quits her job, steals for him, gets arrested for it and sent to juvenile prison, AND finds out she's pregnant by him! She arranges for an abortion, but changes her mind and decides to have the baby and start her life anew.

Truffaut's love of the cinema and its ""magic"" - the music, quick pacing, and loving use of the camera (spiral ""highlight"" shots, for example) - is very much in evidence here. The tone of the movie, which has every reason to be depressing, never becomes that and is more like the tone a loving relative might assume when revealing the exploits of a favorite misbegotten family member. And in that situation we are usually expected not to ask too many questions or require any moralizing: indeed, a happy ending (of sorts) is plucked from what probably should be ashes. Truffaut goes for a warm, fuzzy feeling and achieves it. Some may argue that he's sacrificed honesty in the process, but truth can come in many different packages. A very pleasant movie-watching experience delivered by a master filmmaker.",1135036800,3,1582,4.493055555555555
7816884,4,6301930606,"I really liked this story, maybe because it was filmed in my home country and it reminded me of a lot of places and memories.

It is the story of a country girl who was orphaned by war. She becomes a depraved adolescent who is forced to survive on her own. She takes a job as a maid, but she is not a really good one! One can easily understand why : she is a ""thief""! She simply has never learned other values than the ones she created for herself. This certainly explains in part why she likes so much to steal, make lies, and occasionally use her charms to get what she wants: after all, these are the only means of surviving that she knows. But despite her innocent appearance (something like a ""Snow White""), she is stronger and wiser than she seems. Not so innocent after all?

It was perhaps the first and the best part Charlotte Gainsbourg ever played, to my opinion at least. Although I don't think Charlotte is the greatest French actress of all times, she was young and perfect for the role. Because of her timid and bizarre personality, she was credible as Janine. Unlike Janine, the actress didn't grow up in poverty, neither was she raised in a remote ""bourgade"" (village) somewhere in a corner of the French ""Province""! She was also from a generation who never witnessed the occupation of France during WWII.

People then lived harsh lives in almost constant fear and in constant need. This sort of situation wasn't poetic in France, and can never be anywhere in the world either. The movie depicts, through the story of Janine and her fellow companions, postwar France and the sad repercussions of a conflict on people.  BUT, fortunately, there is hope  and some love at the end.",1129680000,2,1694,4.540983606557377
7816885,5,6301930606,"More so than most directors, Francois Truffaut drew on his personal experiences (e.g., ""400 Blows"") in crafting cinematic tales of the pain and pleasure of growing up. ""The Little Thief"" began as a script idea of Truffaut's in the 1950s, but had never been realized at the time of his untimely death, in 1984. Janine (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is a 15-year-old girl, growing up poor in postwar France. Janine is in a hurry to grow up. But to Janine, who survived as a street urchin during the Nazi occupation, growing up means stealing and getting away with other such petty crimes and losing her virginity ASAP. After being run out of town by the local gendarmes, Janine goes to work as a maid in a rich couple's house and eventually falls in love with an older, married choirmaster (Didier Bezace), who tries to steer Janine away from crime and towards a productive life. Although she finds sex with him exciting, he is much older and their difference in maturity eventually drives the couple apart. Janine then falls in love with a young man, Raoul (Simon de la Brosse), who is from the lower classes, and influences her to drop out of school in order to pull off a heist during a dinner party held by her employers. After getting arrested and landing in reform school, Janine comes to realize that growing up is not all it is cut out to be. She begins turning her life around when she meets a fellow inmate, who teaches her about photography and darkroom printing. After escaping from the reform school, Janine finds that she is pregnant with Raoul's baby.  Again, she wants to run away from her problems, and returns to her hometown to visit a back-alley abortionist.  But Janine has no money, so the abortionist demands Janine's twin-reflex camera as payment.  Assessing the situation, Janine realizes that she's been handed a sucker's deal; She will only end up without a camera and without her baby.  So, Janine commits one last crime:  She steals back her camera, decides to have her baby and straightens out her life, accepting responsibility for her actions.
The feel of the movie is dead-on for capturing postwar France in 1950:  The costumes, the sets, the automobiles, the Path newsreels and the period music all conjure a bygone era with style.  Alain Jomy's impressionistic soundtrack recalls the best scores of Georges Delarue.
""The Little Thief""  is a poetic, beautiful, moral tale, but never moralizing. It's easy to relate to Janine's predicament, the urge of the adolescent to break the chains of society. Director Claude Miller uses this fable to teach the important lesson that one can only learn from life by having lived it.",1018828800,17,2645,4.81057268722467
7816886,2,6301930606,"I kept waiting for something to happen in this movie. But it's just the  story of a girl, who likes to steal small stuff. I really expected more  from Truffaut, who wrote the screenplay. Although I am not familiar with  her work, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who plays the lead character, is fun to  see. Not enough though, to recommend this movie to anybody.",961891200,3,352,4.629032258064516
