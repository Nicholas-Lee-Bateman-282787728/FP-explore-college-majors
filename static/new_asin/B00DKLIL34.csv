8594135,3,B00DKLIL34,"I lived in St. Augustine for many years. I moved away in 1992 and have not been able to return. I thought this would be a great way to ""go back"" for now. Although the DVD started out great at the Fort then down St. George Street, I felt the rest of the DVD was kind of a waste. I know there is MUCH to see in St. Augustine and the makers could only show so much in 50 minutes, but I feel that 50 minutes could have been used better. I thought all the time wasted walking near Flagler College could have been spent walking along Matanzas Bay up to the stunning Bridge of Lions. Then back down near the town square and then down St. George Street. Also, the makers went back down the same section of St. George street twice and that time could have been better spent someplace else since we had already seen that section once already. It did not seem that the ones filming the DVD had much of a plan an so we end up with a lot of wasted time.",1427673600,2,940,4.00531914893617
