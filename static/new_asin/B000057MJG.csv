1403803,4,B000057MJG,"This movie deserves to be on DVD, as do all Audie's westerns. I simply do not understand selling products that only certain people can buy. Movies have always been sold in forms that anyone could watch. Anyone can watch a film. Anyone can watch a VHS version (all VHS players play VHS tapes). Anyone can watch a DVD (all DVD players play DVDs). Why have you made it proprietary Amazon? I would like to give you money and have you give me stuff in return. I can't in this case. Since you do video on demand, what's the problem?

1403804,3,B000057MJG,"i loved this movie as a kid and broke many toy guns acting out the last 20 mins.

well it's not as good as i remember it to be but this tale of the army looking to keep the title guns away from the indians is liked by my boys and we watch it together and that makes this one worth checking out.",1140825600,8,294,3.6666666666666665

1403818,4,B000057MJG,"The plot was typical and the ending predictable, but maybe that is because I have watched westerns for most of my life. Audie Murphy is the hero and does what a hero is supposed to do - extraordinary feats of bravery. It does what it is supposed to do and that is entertain. If you have some time to kill and want to be taken back to a time in our history without too much need to use your brain, watch it.",1393632000,,406,3.9634146341463414
1403819,5,B000057MJG,Good movie...I thoroughly enjoyed it... I love Audie Murphy both as a man and an actor... His heroics in WWII have been unequaled.  Too bad PTSD was not recognized back then... I believe he would have had a happier personal life as it been recognized in him and treated.,1374364800,,270,4.510204081632653
1403820,5,B000057MJG,"Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. Also loved the great young supporting cast, The very pretty Laraine Stephens, Michael Burns, and Michael Blodgett. A very nice B western film.",1363392000,,184,4.78125
1403821,5,B000057MJG,"I am a big fan of Audie Murphy westerns. When I found this movie and at a reasonable price, I just had to have it. Audie plays a calvary officer trying to get some rifles to his fort. You'll find, right off, keeping the rifles away from the hostile Indians is his main concern. During the long trek to his fort, he has his share of problems. Greed, betrayal and death play a major part in his journey. Frankly, I believe that you'll find this an interesting movie.",1346889600,2,464,4.284090909090909
1403822,1,B000057MJG,I'd love to have this movie.  But why on earth pay a thousand bucks for it?  I'll wait 40 years for the price to be reasonable.,1340755200,,127,3.8461538461538463
1403823,2,B000057MJG,"40 Guns to Apache Pass was a Columbia Pictures production. This review is of how Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has ignored our greatest war hero and not of the poor quality of this offering. This release is not one of Columbia Pictures/SPHE's. Our greatest war hero's memory deserves better treatment. I will purchase this DVD when Sony remasters it for DVD release. Even better, Sony should remaster Audie Murphy's remaining movies not yet released on DVD onto a series of Blu-Ray collections befitting a man of his stature. Randolph Scott deserves the same multiple Blu-Ray collections of his many westerns he starred in. C'mon Sony, start mining those golden nuggets in your vaults, polish them up (remaster) and release them in standard DVD and Blu-Ray to protect them for posterity and to give us western movie collectors something worth buying. I buy 20 western DVDs and Blu-Rays to 1 modern movie today because they knew good story telling back in the day and morals of right and wrong were reinforced with their telling. Today, we have many people wondering through life without a moral compass. But, I digress. Please give Audie and Randolph the respect they deserve and do it right! You have gold mines in your vaults if you'd only realize it and treat their fans and these stars of long ago the way they should be treated. I have written to SPHE already. I hope others will too. Happy Trails, partner!",1336089600,5,1415,4.827160493827161
1403824,3,B000057MJG,"I watched this movie on the Western channel a few weeks ago which prompted this purchase. A good movie starring one of my all-time favorites Audie Murphy. Now on to the DVD - The video needs to be remastered. It looks like a VHS copy put on a disc. This movie is good enough for some studio to remaster it. I wasn't happy with the video transfer but it's not a total loss. It is decent enough to watch. I would recommend that if you wan't to buy this to not pay a high price for it. I will keep this DVD because i'm a fan of Murphy and Calvary versus Indian movies. Being that this is an older release it may be the only copy that I ever get of this film, that would be a shame. Unless somebody picks this up to remaster, somebody needs to step up.",1334793600,10,748,3.993333333333333
7933021,4,B000057MJG,"Audie Murphy is a cavalry captain in this film and he act as an impatient man with those who disobey orders and those who are cowardly. The film is rated PG, which in my mind means it is pretty good, and the rating is correct. The plot in the film focuses on the post-Civil war period in Arizona Territory. Both the whites and the Indians claim ownership of the Territory. The army is on the side of the whites, as is Murphy in this film. The Indians swore they will kill every white that comes to the territory. A subplot, as expected, is a love relationship. The woman is more loving than Murphy but she becomes angry when Murphy fails to save her brother. Another subplot is a former Confederate soldier who was forced by the Union army to join its forces when he was captured and forced to go west and fight the Indians. He is disgruntled, a trouble maker, and tries a few times to kill Murphy. The Indians have a larger army than the whites and the army want to have 40 repeating rifles delivered. Murphy goes against enormous odds to acquire them. The disgruntled man gets a hold of them.",1523318400,,1094,4.367647058823529
7933022,3,B000057MJG,"40 Guns to Apache Pass, 1961 film

In the summer of 1869 Cochise promised to wipe out white settlers from southern Arizona. The Army would to prevent this. Survivors are being relocated to a place of safety, Apache Wells, where their strength can be concentrated. Its the only way. They have little time to pack, or for the Cavalry to rest. The settlers home is burned to deprive the Apaches of its shelter. Water is scarce and rationed. They must be on guard all night. There is a conflict between Captain Coburn and Bodine a soldier (in the dark night). [To hide a double?] In the day the Apaches attack closer! Can the Cavalry hold out? The sons of a settler want to join the Army.

There is a shipment of new lever-action rifles, but they must be carried through Apache areas. A small team is selected, all volunteers; they leave at night. They are seen in the day; there is shooting. One trooper is captured alive, but is soon killed. The wagon of guns is located and taken away. But Bodine stages a mutiny to take the guns and desert, and sell them in Mexico. Will all join in? Not the Captain and the Sergeant, who are tied up and left behind. Bodine tells about his past, a Galvanized Yankee. The two bound men free themselves then follow the wagon to recover the 40 guns. The two men return to camp. Can the Captain recover the guns?

Can they be spared in case of a future attack? No, says the Colonel. Coburn tells the boys sister what happened, she doesnt believe him. Is Bruce heartless? He leaves at night to try to recover that wagon. That group of mutineers goes on; each repeating rifle is worth $1,000 in gold. Bodine will sell them for Apache gold. Cochise agrees to the sale. Coburn finds the deserters. Doug helps him. They leave together. Cochise and the Apaches follow the two men with the rifles. Doug will ride back with the rifles, Bruce will stay behind to stop the Apaches. Can he do it alone? Bodine will go after Bruce. Doug returns to arm the Cavalry. A small team will ride to rescue Bruce; can they arrive in time? Can Bodine be captured? Or killed? Captain Coburn is wounded, Doug returns to his family.

This is about average for a story. It is based on historical events and with added drama about personal choices under conflicting pressures. Was it realistic for you? It shows a temporary mistake can be rehabilitated and corrected.",1494115200,,2370,4.504651162790697
