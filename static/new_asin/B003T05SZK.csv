8404821,3,B003T05SZK,I was really looking forward to this DVD but it turned out to be less than exciting for me personally. I own many bellydance DVDs and this one just isn't a favorite for me. I don't like the way she instructs as it isn't as clear as some other BD instructors. I would not recommend for beginners. It is nice to add a little variety to your shimmies but that's about it.,1354147200,,368,4.125
8404822,3,B003T05SZK,"This isn't the worst Shimmy DVD out there but there are better ones such as Belly Dance Shimmy DVD for Beginners. The prices are around the same too. The dancer is great and has a lot of skill, and it is nice to see a belly dancer of color, but the quality of the DVD was pretty poor. The background and sound quality were not the best. That being said, I did like that she at least taught you a wide variety of shimmies that you could practice on your own. This DVD is probably better for an intermediate to advanced level belly dancers who are just trying to increase their shimmy repertoire.",1318464000,,594,4.265486725663717
8404823,5,B003T05SZK,I bought it of course because Amar is an amazing dancer and her shimmy is the bomb! My shimmy has definitely improved! I would for sure recommend it to dancers of all levels!,1310860800,2,174,4.303030303030303
8404824,5,B003T05SZK,"I've seen and met Amar Gamal. She is the epitome of bellydance and one of the greatest. This is my third DVD of Amar Gamal's. She too emits personality and style during her performances. This tutorial DVD is ""supreme"" in teaching technique and encouraging a new comer to establish their own style. Amar Gamal continues to teach me how to perfect my form through this DVD. Amar you go girl!",1301875200,,389,4.571428571428571
8404825,5,B003T05SZK,"I appreciated this dvd very much. After buying Bozenka's shimmies DVD, I needed to deepen my aptitude in shimmies. Although Amar's introduction of the basics is short, she presents every moves in a very consecutive and progressive manner. I would suggest to start with Bozenka's  DVD then Amar's;  the pratice time is short  but you can just pause and practice each moves for 5mn or more. I am very pleased with this DVD, it is about 1h30 long .. excellent.. I am a beginner/intermiediate leveled dancer..",1298505600,2,505,4.848837209302325
8404826,4,B003T05SZK,"Actually a pretty good video for begining through advanced, not better than most of the belly daning videos I have not worse about avarage.",1291680000,,139,4.833333333333333
8404827,5,B003T05SZK,"I really liked this dvd. It was done so well, very concise, making it easy to keep up. Great DVD!!!!!!",1286150400,2,102,4.15
8404828,3,B003T05SZK,"I ordered this DVD purely because I love Amar Gamal but I already had a hunch that it would probably not be anything overly amazing. The DVD comes in eco packaging that opens like a book and the chapter list is printed on the inside so you can never lose it.
Right as the DVD started I was disappointed with the quality of the production, it felt very amateurish. There are chapter titles that appear on every new section and they look like something I can do myself on my computer. The set where Amar instructs is Middle Eastern inspired and helps to set the mood. Amar does the whole video in front of a mirror at a slight angle, which I like because you can see the movements from both sides.
Amar is a great teacher and a wonderful dancer but I feel like this DVD is something most dancers can skip. I'm not sure what level I would rate this DVD at because while it focuses on the basic most common shimmies the instruction is not as thorough as other beginner's DVDs I have. The practice time is not very significant either, she breaks down the movement at a medium pace and then gets into it and starts layering. Granted, these are only shimmies so the layers don't get overly complicated but I feel that for a basics type of shimmy DVD there should be far more drills before layering begins to increase endurance and overall execution of the movement. It can be really discouraging for beginners who learn how to do a hybrid shimmy and have her layer a shimmy with a maya 20 minutes later. Once again, Amar is a good teacher and great dancer but I feel like there's something missing in how the instruction will come across to inexperienced dancers. As for intermediate and advanced dancers, I think these dancers can skip this DVD because it seems so basic and it does not offer drills to practice the more challenging layered shimmies. Amar just introduces how to do various layers for about 2 minutes and moves on. It would be frustrating for experienced dancers to have to go through the breakdown of the movement each time before getting on to the short practice portion.
I'm pretty disappointed with the DVD because I love Amar but I feel like this DVD lacks  professional production and a clear direction in terms of targeted audience.

Bonus Performance: Nubian (music by Raquy and the Caveman) i really enjoyed this performance, she incorporates movements from African dance with bellydance and it looks so seamless and fun. Amar's dancing never disappoints me.
DVD run time: 75 minutes
I wanted to mention that the combinations are introduced rather quickly and she spends an average of about 2 minutes on them 9that includes breakdown and practice on both sides), these are not drills, more like ideas on how to combine what you learned. The advanced combos are not super advanced, for example combo 5 you do an undulation with a hybrid shimmy, reverse undulation with hybrid shimmy, one legged circle out with shimmy and one legged circle in with shimmy. Combo 2 is a straight legged shimmy and then a vibration shimmy, back to straight and then choo-choo shimmy (tip toe shimmy). Unfortunately, considering the content in the DVD i would absolutely not say that it is for all levels, it is quite basic. And while Amar does impart helpful tips on how to make your shimmies smoother as you introduce multiple directions to your movements, there simply is not a significant amount of practice dedicated to each move.
That said, Amar is a beautiful dancer and she does instruct clearly so if you love her dancing the way I do and are an advanced beginner you may find this DVD to be useful since the information would still be relatively new and you would have enough technique to not need a thorough breakdown. However, if you are very inexperienced or experienced, I do not find this DVD worth the investment because it seems like a hard DVD to work with. It almost comes off like a reference guide to the most common shimmies with a one minute practice portion per move in between. I wish Amar would pair up with World Dance New York where she could have a great production team and help organizing a more accessible belly dance DVD that can actually offer vaulable information to beginner and advanced dancers alike . I love how WDNY has the practice flows where you can drill new moves and combos all in a row so you can get your drilling in without being dragged through the breakdown every single time. I probably would have liked this DVD more if I was not so accustomed to the way WDNY belly dance videos are usually laid out with the technique/combination instruction and actual practice being separate.",1285632000,32,5472,4.7660695468914644
