7880533,4,6304937067,"I bought Rail Away Epic Train Journeys vol 1 and 2 for my father some years ago, and we've both continued to enjoy these excellent videos of train adventures and travel from around the world.  Each episode is well organized and informative, providing high-quality cinematography of both the country and the trains, with commentary on both.  I've watched every episode several times and still enjoy them.",1066262400,,403,5.090909090909091
