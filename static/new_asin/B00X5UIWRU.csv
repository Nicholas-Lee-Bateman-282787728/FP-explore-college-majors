7158827,4,B00X5UIWRU,"One of my favorite DCU animated movies; trippy storyline, inventive action scenes, great animation!  The full sized hard cover comic is written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quietly and they are as great as ever.  Besides the Blu ray and hard cover comic, there is also a DVD of the movie, digital copy of the movie, and digital copy of the comic.  Truly great value; buy it and hopefully DC/WB will add more to this series.  I would love to get Dark Knight Returns and Batman Under the Red Hood with their hard cover comics.",1440201600,4,532,4.453608247422681
7158828,3,B00X5UIWRU,"The quality of the book is somewhat low, with wavy pages and gutter loss as mentioned in another review.  It's not terrible by any means, but annoying.  The UV digital copy code isn't recognized, which is an annoyance.  UV has escalated it to WB and they so far, are silent.  Since the disks are stored in the back cover, it will be a minor storage issue.  I probably won't buy anymore of these, and will trade this back in for a few Amazon bucks.",1439510400,,447,4.273809523809524
7158829,5,B00X5UIWRU,"You can find info on the stories from the individual book and movie so I'm only going to talk about the packaging.

I looked around and could find out much information about this but went ahead and took a shot and bought it.  The book is a hardcover format and is full size (instead of a little Blu Ray size).  The JLA Earth 2 book alone sells for around 10-12 dollars so it's a great deal if you don't have either.  The book does have a bit of gutter loss but it's not too bad.  Still completely readable.  It comes with a book (looks like comixology) and movie (Ultraviolet) digital code .  The two discs (DVD/Blu Ray) don't come in a separate case but is actually stored in the back cover of the book.",1439337600,8,704,4.208955223880597

8715070,5,B00X5UIWRU,"In one product you get the hard-cover graphic novel, digital copy of the movie, DVD, and Blu-ray! I love that it comes with the graphic novel. I've watched most of the new cartoon movies, but didn't know where to find the comics that went with the story line. This presents it all as one great product!",1487030400,,302,4.410714285714286
