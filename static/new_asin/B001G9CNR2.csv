3598326,5,B001G9CNR2,"A funny movie about a man with a perfect immune system picked by the British space program to be the first man sent to the moon.

Light hearted and witty. Kenneth More is outstanding as the lead character. Shirley Anne Field is very attractive as More's love interest.",1483747200,3,268,4.583333333333333

3598328,3,B001G9CNR2,"Man in the Moon (UK, 1960, B&W, d/Basil Dearden)

The production values of this disk would normally land it in the bargain bin at your local drug store with a price somewhere around $3.99.  The black and white image is okay on a computer screen and the British accents are sometimes a little hard to make out.  Subtitles or captions would be nice, but there are none.  The disk doesn't even include the trailer.

The feature itself, however, is one of those minor classics that independent UK studios were so good at creating decades ago.  The antics of William Blood, whose sole qualification for a top-secret astronaut training program seems to be his inability to get sick, are (mostly) of the understated, tongue-in-cheek, stiff-upper-lip, hell-of-a-way-to-run-a-railway variety never quite duplicated on this side of the pond.  Some of the humor centers on the fussiness of British bureaucracy but almost all of it translates perfectly well.  This is a clever and funny movie, out of circulation for far too long.  If it cost a fraction of its list price, it would be a marvelous bargain as well.

One advisory, however:  the production bureaucrats who packaged the disk put a quite unnecessary spoiler in the blurb on the back of the box, and it's repeated in the online product description.  It might be best to avoid reading it until after watching the movie.

Bottom line:  Rather overpriced, I think, but still a nice bit of British whimsey.",1252800000,6,1451,4.89344262295082
3598329,5,B001G9CNR2,This is one of my all time favorite movies and I know each scene by heart. I'm disappointed that they removed the original song at the dance and replaced it with generic music.,1518739200,2,176,4.363636363636363

3598333,5,B001G9CNR2,"I saw this movie when I was the same age as the age Reese Witherspoon portrays in the movie as Dani. My mom really wanted me to watch it because I loved Legally Blonde quite a bit at that age as well. I enjoyed this movie then and I still enjoy it now. The time it's set in definitely changes some of the real life experiences girls go through the summer before they enter junior high.... but that doesn't make it any less real. This is an amazing movie, and I will always love and appreciate it as Witherspoon's first starring role.",1517011200,,533,4.235294117647059

The guy was kinda a douche tho,

3598336,1,B001G9CNR2,"Reese is absolutely amazing. My one star is for the terrible plot and guy who is a real jerk. This isn't unrequited love.. it's someone being a total @$$hole! And they glorified it! And romanticized it! I want to scream ""Why are you so stupid and letting someone treat you like that?"" Talk about no self-respect.",1515974400,4,312,4.589285714285714

8304592,5,B001G9CNR2,"I love this movie. I'm 60 years and this reminded me of much better times, when people were much more civil, and children respected their parents. We as children slept out on the porch on hot summer nights, and people didn't even lock their doors and left the keys in their cars. And it made me cry also. That would be a very difficult place for the girls to be, and I could see how the guy could have gotten him self into such a mess with the sisters. I don't blame the guy, after all he did show a lot of control when the younger girl was throwing her self at him. The ending was good. I do wish that our country was more like it was in those days.",1522022400,,650,3.969465648854962
8304593,5,B001G9CNR2,"I've seen this film many times and it got to me the first time i ever saw it, which was on an airplane flight. Not sure what all the negative comments are for or why so many are thinking Court  ( Jason London) was a D bag. He's 17!!  Although I think the film should have explored Court and Maureen's love affair more, it is still a sweet and tender film. The ending is unlike most Hollywood endings and it is truly sad. I'm a guy and I cry every time I watch this damn film. One thing you can take away from the film is how simple a time it was in the 50s and there are good old fashioned manners and displays of respect throughout. You can also really get a sense for the hot summer with the birds chirping, the nighttime insects, the characters sweaty brows and the girls sleeping on the porch for some relief. Ignore the negative comments, this is a very enjoyable film, and Dani was as believable and genuine as any 14 year old girl in love could be. Watch it...and have Kleenex ready",1521676800,,989,4.172774869109948

8304595,3,B001G9CNR2,Sorry but this was too depressing for me.  Somewhere along the way I realized I'd seen this movie before and remembered the ending.  I did watch it through til the end but am not a fan of where this movie went.  I saw no reason for the tragedy that occurred.  Why couldn't it have been a happier ending.  Some people called the young man a douche bag but I think it was normal behavior for a teenager.  I won't make the mistake of watching it again.,1520899200,,449,4.162790697674419
