7877421,4,630481206X,I was thrilled to find this tape on the 1995/96 figure skating season.  It was an eventful season and this video gives a good overview of the key events.  I was particularly pleased to be able to see the story of Michelle Kwan's first world title and Rudy Galindo's triumph at the 1996 US Championships again - great memories indeed!,1329868800,,333,4.533333333333333
7877422,4,630481206X,"In this video, we are treated to the 1995-1996 season of amateur figure skating. Magic Memories On Ice III highlights one of the best seasons of skating, where Michelle Kwan is pretty much the focus here. In this volume, we see Michelle Kwan's rise to 1996 U.S. National Champion, and an unforgettable duel for the World Championship between her and Lu Chen of China, where Michelle ended up the victor. But there are also other gems in this video: Rudy Galindo's excellent skate to become national champion, Todd Eldredge's Gold Medal World performance, plus little caps from other international skaters. Actually, come to think of it, Magic Memories On Ice III showcases a lot of ""firsts"" for skaters, the previously mentioned winners as well as Russia's Irina Slutskaya's first European Championship. And the annoying commentary from Dick Button is practically deleted, replaced with the pleasant and only occasional word from Dick Emberg. Every skating fan should have this.",1035244800,12,978,5.19620253164557
7877423,5,630481206X,"This is my new favorite movie!(Magic Memories on Ice II being the old favorite.) If you want drama, action, and sports all in one movie, pick this one!",1015459200,,151,4.428571428571429
7877424,5,630481206X,"I agree with everything that has already been said about how great this video is -- it shows both of Michelle's most legendary programs in their entirety, as well as Lulu's mesmerizing LP at Worlds.  You also get a glimpse at things to come as Tara Lipinski blazes through the end of her LP at 1996 Worlds.  :)  And of course Rudy's Nationals performance!
The only thing I really missed on this tape was the commentary that was running over Rudy's LP at Nationals.  I don't ever remember Dick Button being so speechless and excited at the same time, and the commentating over his program made you really feel like you were actually there.  Other than that very small complaint this video gets an A++ and is an absolute necessity in any skating fan's collection.",996451200,3,761,4.607407407407408
7877425,5,630481206X,"This is one video you need to own if you are a fan of Michelle.  Although she is the greastest skater in the world, you can still see how much progress she has made since she frist appeared to the world sceen.  Eventhough she was only 15 you will be able to feel the power she expresses herself on ice through the tip of her figures.  It's the best video every and one that you will not regreat getting it.",990403200,6,406,4.05
7877426,5,630481206X,"This video is fantastic.  Like the other 2 ""Magic Memories"" videos, it relies mostly on competitive performances of skaters with just enough of the behind the scenes extras to make it intriguing.  Michelle Kwan's 96 Worlds performances - Romanza and Salome - are included in their entirety, along with Chen Lu's Rachmaninoff LP.  No annoying extra commentary, just skating.  Rudy Galindo's priceless LP at 96 Nationals and his emotional reaction are on this video as well.  And, Todd Eldredge's winning LP from 96 Worlds is uncut and stunning.  The complete LACK of the usual annoying cuts and extra voiceovers make this a one of a kind chance to relive these performances as if it were the first time.
The quality is excellent - sharp, clear and bright.  The only thing I didn't like about this video was the fact that it had to end.  This remains my favorite commercial skating video ever and I highly recommend it, as well as the first two in the series.",980985600,16,957,4.72289156626506
7877427,4,630481206X,This video shows a wide variety of programs and  really captures the emotion of the programs. It  shows Michelle Kwan's 1996 short and long world's  programs. It also includes Todd Eldrige's and  Rudy Galindo's  national and world performance's.  This is a well made video and there  isn't too  much talking by the narrator. By this video while  it's still  available!,942883200,23,368,4.983333333333333
