7697697,5,B01D5MQPNU,"I watched every episode of this show when it was on Sifi. Now I am waiting to see if they will bring the show back as they left it in bimbo. It's about 7 people with an android who don't know who they are. That's what makes it so interesting. They each have gifts, but they learn their names and who they are suppose to be, but that's about it. I won't buy Season 1 because it's just too much right now. I will wait until the price comes down. Until then I will wait to see if the Sifi Channel will renew this series or just drop it. If they drop it, then I am going to have to stop watching this channel all together.",1461283200,7,618,3.9126984126984126
7697698,4,B01D5MQPNU,"From the crew of the Stargate series comes one of the most visually unique series on TV.

It's no secret that Syfy channel is running low on good shows of their titular genre. Dark Matter takes a step toward rectifying that. A dark and gritty, yet colorful, action-filled but character-focused serial about seven strangers on a derelict spacecraft with no memory of their past lives. The diverse characters must work with each other to resolve the moral dilemmas around every corner, whenever they stop to replenish their dwindling supplies or explore their ship (whose name I won't spoil for plot reasons).

The tone of Battlestar Galactica meets the moral issues of Firefly meets an evolved Stargate. The acting is hit-or-miss, but when it's a hit, it's good. The constant plot twists will keep you guessing until the very last few seconds of the season.

As a huge fan of the show, I must say $45 is a bit steep, but watch on Netflix and see for yourself, and the price will likely decrease shortly after release anyway.",1459468800,54,1023,4.768361581920904

7697700,5,B01D5MQPNU,"I watched the whole series on Netflix so my review is based on that. The first season was the best of the three. It had plausibility and a lot of good stuff without becoming so far out there that it was hard to believe in what I was watching.

I must say the skinny little girl who kind of takes command of a group of amnesiac ruffians was a little hard to swallow, but it is fiction after all.

Some of the martial arts got to me after a while. Just not especially realistic. Way too many times people get hit with blows that would take them down but they just keep coming like nothing happened.

As the series progressed it got less and less plausible but still watchable.",1507507200,,674,4.209302325581396

7697702,3,B01D5MQPNU,"I gave Dark Matter, Season 1 an average mark.  I like movies about amnesiacs.  I like SiFi.  I binge watched the series and enjoyed it.  When I went to view the series a second time, I got stuck in the first episode.  That was when I realized that I had lost empathy for most of the characters.

The character development was really shallow.  We see how the characters behave in a variety of situations and we are given news clips of the characters' past lives.  Missing is the inner conflict of people rebelling against the shackles of a past life.  Missing are genuine motives of people evolving and reimagining themselves.

7697709,1,B01D5MQPNU,"Once again, entertainment value is sacrificed to ""political correctness"" as the ridiculous Hollywood cliche of the ""female action hero"" takes centre stage and ruins the show.
Within minutes of the series opening, the lead female character attacks a male character standing at the ships controls (and beats him of course) for no better reason than ""he was in my way!""
Such behaviour being so counter-productive and improbable as to be ludicrous, the show continues in a similar vein, obviously thinking that this has established the female lead as a ""strong character"" who can ""beat men on their own terms!""
What a joke! Even in prisons, violent socipathic men do not behave so irrationally!
In their rush to cater to left wing feminists with an ""affirmative action"" cliche, writers of this show miss the fact that most of their potential audience will be young males as unimpressed with the bad joke of a gratuitously violent female lead as I am.
Yet another show ruined by the left-wing political agenda of its writers.

7697717,5,B01D5MQPNU,"Once in a generation, a show comes along that insists you pay attention to it. Nearly fifty years after the debut of Star Trek, Dark Matter is the latest show turning heads in the world of science fiction and it is like nothing you have ever seen before. Blending elements of Star Trek, Lost, and Knight Rider, this new show from the producers of Stargate SG1, will have you talking about it and pining for the next episode.

Orbiting a planet out in deep space on the edges of civilization, six people wake up on a spaceship, with no memory of who they are or how they got there. After pairing up and searching the ship, they discover it's full of weapons. With the help of an android they find on board, the crew discovers they are orbiting a disputed planet and the weapons are likely for the colonists below. The crew quickly becomes attached to the colonists, that is until they learn the horrible truth, that they are mercenaries at the top of the galactic authorities most wanted list. They know they must be there to remove the colonist for one of the big corporations that now run the galaxy, but with the lose of their memories, came something no one could have expected, a conscience. Eventually, the crew of the ship called, The Raza, decide they have to stick together and find out who they are, where they're from, and what happened to them, so begins Dark Matter.

Each episode is another adventure, dealing with the authority, their old enemies, and their old employers. They don't know their friends from their enemies, but after each adventure they get another piece of the puzzle and we get a glimpse into their passed lives. Together with the crew, the audience has the pleasure of trying to figure out who these people were, what happened to them, and debate on where they may be going.

Much like Star Trek, this show has a virtually unknown cast, and is slowly producing it's own stars. I only recognized a couple of name, but the different skills each cast member present is as incredible and unique as the characters themselves. The women on board have moves that would make Bruce Lee jealous, but not to be overlooked is the cast interactions with each other, which often times are hilarious. The cast is diverse and so are the characters and their backgrounds, in coming together they all play on each others strengths and weaknesses to make this one of the most enjoyable shows on television.

I watch a lot of TV, probably a lot more than is healthy, but in all this time, there have only been a handful of shows that I can honestly say, I could not wait to see the next episode, Dark Matter is one of those shows. Honestly I get home early on the nights it on and put on SyFy fifteen minutes early so that I don't miss a second. The first two seasons are currently streaming, go and watch the pilot and I promise you, weather you love science fiction or not, Dark Matter will have you hooked.",1495238400,,2922,4.507547169811321

7697725,5,B01D5MQPNU,"I've become very prejudiced against modern sci fi - for every ""Firefly"", ""Battlestar Galactica remake"" or ""The Expanse"" over the last several decades there have been a hundred thinly veiled fear of foreigners alien invasions, monster horror films set in space (cheap ""Alien"" knockoffs), or science fiction concept shows written by people who don't know the first thing about science or human nature and are trying for some notion of formula involving spaceships, aliens, AI, or exotic technology, missing the true value of a science fiction setting, which is for telling good human stories.  Dark Matter is the good stuff.  It's fresh, smart, edgy, interesting, ambitious, ambiguous, moving, has a real, changing story with real, changing characters.  And at times it's absolutely hilarious (listen to ""3""!).  I was not a fan of the Stargate works, finding them too flawed and/or formulaic one way or another, but whatever Stargate contingent came to work on Dark Matter seems to have learned from the mistakes of the Stargate works.  Dark Matter is the good stuff.  Give it a chance!  As for the blu ray package, it works just fine except that it makes me want/expect a blu ray for season 2, which hasn't happened as of this writing.  (I have no idea why people think season 2 is not as strong as season 1 - my guess is those are the people who don't like real situational and character changes.)",1485129600,13,1397,4.864978902953586

7697728,4,B01D5MQPNU,"Though Ive gotten bored with most scripted dramas on TV, finding them a predictable reworking of older stories or shows, Dark Matter became a must see for my wife and I for season 1.  The show has a lot of clichs, but for the first season had some good chemistry and plot twists.
The crew waking up from hibernation in a damaged, highly armed small freighter, with no memories (except for useful skills as with most amnesia in fiction), except for one teen girl who had acquired scrambled copies of everyone elses memories.  Initially with no memories of their names, they refer to each other by the order they woke up.  (The man who woke up first is 1 the woman who woke up second is 2 etc.)  Then they find they were brutal criminal mercenaries, on route to wipe out a mining colony (to the last man woman and child), so their client could claim the planet on the cheap as abandoned property.  Revolted by who they were they keep their numbers as names, and set out to become better people, get out of life, etc  while not being killed by ex-enemies or clients.  All while trying to unravel various mysteries about themselves and the situation and universe they find themselves in.  All mixed in with plot twists leaving clues for later eps plots, and good plot hooks making for a very watchable show.

Critical in the first seasons success is the character chemistry and development. The main character and captain 2 being a main example.  Initially assuring the others she will find a way out of this for them, she must decide herself if she wants to go straight, open up and embrace the affection she has for the teen girl 5 she feels like a sister to, and the continuously loyal and supportive (almost regardless of the cost to himself) man 1 she falls in love with.  Or following 3s advice and just go back to more like what she was, and the group staying criminals and mercenaries.  The relationship between 2 and 3 is essentially two junkies, one debating on kicking the stuff and building a real life, the other an enabler telling her things were fine before, why bother.  With a Lets do a couple lines and not worry about it. attitude.  This arc Leeds to a crashing crisis toward seasons end.

FYI.  Strangely for season 2 all the strengths of season 1 were wittingly or unwittingly cut.  It's like a lifeless knock off of season 1.",1483056000,,2343,4.514218009478673

7697737,5,B01D5MQPNU,"I don't often love new series. At the moment I like this, orphan black, the 100, wynonna Earp, ash vs evil dead, supernatural, grimm, doctor who, Sherlock and of course stranger things. Now I am one of those from birth scifi/fantasy lovers and grew up always a huge fan of everything while it was on tv... So of course I know stargate & lost girl and their creators and the syfy channel. So what can I say about this series? Have you ever seem firefly? I remember the day that aired and thinking joss, cowboys in space and a unique family cast that allowed for a close knit stories. Sure you can tell something big and bold and broad like let's say battlestar and that's all well and good but firefly have us something closer to that group of friends and also space... Like Star Trek meets buffy if you will. So here we get this show and it opens with a cast of 7, there are other occasional actors but the main 7 are what the story focuses on. And like in firefly you have the closed ship and some off ship 'missions' *spoilers* each has a unique and fairly tragic story unfold and as you delve deeper they form new connections to each other and possibly doing the right thing. The youngest member is a roughly 15 year old stow away who gives off a Claudia Donavan (warehouse 13) vibe and I never can tell how she manages to get and keep her hair that awesome green color. There is a woman aparently and an android and three men, one a fighter, one who seems rather Simon Tam and one who seems to be a career criminal and he makes everyone a little uneasy.

7697742,4,B01D5MQPNU,"Review of the Series, not the DVD or Blu-ray

Season 1 of Dark Matter is just enough to get you REALLY interested in the series.  Set aboard a spacecraft (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B000HAB4VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>&nbsp;which seems much smaller), the reluctant crew, and that's what you MUST call them since they have no idea who they are, try to piece together their lives and ""mission"".

The writing is pretty darn good.  Character development is decent but with the customary ""one of everything"" you kind of know more about each crewman than the series actually reveals.  However, there's the occasional twist which is just enough to keep things interesting.  The downside is the ever popular love interest story within the crew.  Not only is it very predictable, it detracts a LOT from what could be a really interesting set up.

Dark Matter is a good Science Fiction series.  The premise, while not new by any means, is well played out with bits and pieces of their former lives dealt out like a 7-Card Stud poker hand.",1473206400,,1106,5.383720930232558
7697743,5,B01D5MQPNU,"This is my new favorite after Firefly.  There have been several science-fiction programs made since Firefly but I haven't enjoyed any of them as much as this one.  I first saw Dark Matter on Netflix and I finished the entire season in two evenings.  I was immediately hooked and searched for the series on DVD, only to find that they weren't available in Region 1.  I watched the series on Netflix several times, expecting them to drop the series before I was ready, because that has happened before.  I was thrilled to finally get this in Region 1 format and wasn't disappointed.

7697750,4,B01D5MQPNU,"I saw DARK MATTER sitting on the shelf at a local big box retailer a couple months ago. I kept seeing it and being tempted by it, since Science Fiction is one of my most favorite genres. I finally picked it up one payday not so long ago.

I watched the first episode... and then I watched the second... then the third. Then I went on to the second disc. I got to the third disc last night and was disappointed to discover there are so few episodes. I see the second season is coming out fairly soon, though I've yet to look up the release date. I await it as patiently as I can. I don't watch TV ""over the air,"" so to speak, since my work schedule makes it impossible and I don't either have or want a DVR. I prefer to just wait and get the blu-ray discs. I still have to watch the last couple episodes but I'm kind of delaying it, maybe until I get season two.

I will provide no spoilers. If you like Science Fiction for all the facets it offers you will probably like this show. Some themes and questions it deals with are what determines personality? Is how you act or react determined by genetic programming, ""muscle memory,"" or, possibly, something else? Do we possess Free Will? How much of our current lives have been determined by past choices? Is it possible to escape one's past, carve out a new future? Or are we doomed to stay the course, regardless of our intentions?

I've been pleasantly surprised by this show. It is very interesting from a number of perspectives. I would not say this show is very much like any other show I've seen. It is relatively unique, for a TV series. I suppose it shares some elements with ALIEN (well, almost every Sci-Fi novel/movie/TV series does, honestly), BLADE RUNNER, STARHUNTER (if you've seen that one I think it is the closest to DARK MATTER of anything I've seen), and maybe slightly like FIREFLY but not really. Only from a certain standpoint, otherwise these two are only similar in that they are both Science Fiction. I don't want to say too much. I hate spoilers.

Each character has a story that is unknown to them. It is a different approach to story telling and I've been enjoying DARK MATTER. I eagerly await the next season. If you like character-driven stories and you like well-acted, well-written, well-directed, and well-produced Science Fiction the odds favor that you will enjoy DARK MATTER. Give it a try. You could do much worse.",1469491200,,2401,4.4874141876430205

The story is pretty solid, but it's the characters that really make this show. The team is made up of The Hero, The Captain, The Assassin, The Gun Nut, The Tank, The Robot and The Kid. Within a few episodes you will already be picking favorites and cheering for them. I would recommend you at least watch the first episode, and see how it feels.

 ..... There is an odd thing about the set (maybe just the Blu-ray) that I have not seen before.  When you watch an episode, when it is over goes right into the next episode rather than default back to the main menu.  I've never seen this in any other TV series set, DVD or Blu-ray.

7697761,5,B01D5MQPNU,"'Dark Matter' was a very welcome series, for me. I've been hungry for some gray-matter-rich meal of straight-up Science Fiction, and I have fed well... though the past year got off to a shaky start. 'Killjoys' was a disappointment on every level, and I was beginning to despair that SFTV would be doomed to nosediving tripe like 'Helix' and 'Under the Dome'. Then came 'Dark Matter', and after the first 15-minutes of the pilot episode I knew I could count on long-time Stargate writers, producers and showrunners, Paul Mullie & Joseph Mallozzi to do their thing, and provide me with a regular diet of slightly corny SF awesomeness. Then 'The Expanse' came out, based on the f@#$%^g awesome series of novels by James A.S. Corey -- the sobriquet used by a 2-man writing team that includes Daniel Abraham, whose absolutely brilliant GoT-style Fantasy series, 'The Dagger & The Coin' is my current obsession -- and has done the first novel justice, perhaps THE best SF series in TV history.

[NOTE: The next 2 paragraphs, enclosed by fancy little brackets -- {derp} -- deal with all three Stargate series; the creators of Dark Matter wrote and produced for Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis well over a decade, before stepping up as showrunners for the last two seasons of SG: Atlantis. The strong connection between Stargate and Dark Matter makes comdisparecussions on the rise and fall of SG very relevant for this new endeavour. But if you don't agree, and have not a single f@#$ to give (or send flying) when it comes to Stargate, fair enough. Recent studies conclude with a 51% certainty that this means you're a terrible, evil, puppy-kicker of a person. But... there's also a 49% chance that you're thoroughly awesome, and simply don't take any corn with your Science Fiction. Skip ahead two paragraphs, and Via Con Diablos.]

{Stargate: SG-1 and Atlantis started as guilty pleasures; they were OST-silly at times, with human and inhuman aliens scattered across this galaxy and beyond, all of them speaking English. Stargate: Universe was conceived as a smart-sounding, business-minded decision, conceived as a project that would hang on to Stargate: Atlantis fans -- the series ended (too early, IMO) with Season 5 the year previous -- and attract viewers who were still mourning the end of Battlestar Galactica. These obvious attempts to claim more viewers for the Stargate franchise resulted in a cynicism that hurt the series' chances, and when ratings weren't high enough to justify the increased budget, the DVD and Blu-Ray sales were it's last hope. The Battlestar Galactica business model went so far, they copied BSG's annoying practice of releasing half-season collections. But when BSG got away with it, TV-on-DVD was just getting popular. SG:U was trying the maneuver as prices were dropping, thanks to Netflix and Torrent sites. I was a hardcore Stargate fan, and had all the past seasons of SG:1 and Atlantis on DVD. When I saw they had released a DVD collecting the first 10 episodes, BSG-style, I initially liked the idea; but when I saw the price-tag, my enthusiasm was fully 'curbed'. They wanted more for a half-season than full-seasons of SG: Atlantis had cost as new releases. This was taken as evidence that even the fans disliked the show, which wasn't true.}

{Despite the mistakes and wrong turns that were made when it came to promoting, marketing, packaging and pricing, it was one of the best SF series on television. The ensemble cast was excellent, led by the brilliant performance of Robert Carlyle. The writing was excellent, getting rid of most of the evil English-speaking aliens like the Goa'uld and Wraiths, and focusing on a mysterious ship the characters were forced to board via stargate. This is one of those super-special stargates designed by the Ancients to travel much further than your garden-variety wormhole, possessing an extra symbol that makes figuring out the intergalactic PIN-number a little tough. They resort to the obvious next step of inserting the mathematical problem into a video game, 'Last Starfighter'-style, which allows the writers to include nerdboy genius Eli into the cast. He becomes the 'new recruit/rookie/outsider' character, free to ask all the questions that new viewers need answered without it seeming unnatural... a device used frequently in TV-land to make life easier for writers and viewers, and something the other Stargate series didn't bother with. After their off-world base is attacked, the freshly cracked code to this unknown destination on the edge of the universe is their only way out. A quick check of what awaits them on the other end of the wormhole, using a robot equipped with sensors and camera, reveals a dark room, DHD, and breathable atmosphere; as the base is blowing up around them, they have no choice but to send a mix of scientists, soldiers and untrained visitors on a one-way trip to who-the-f@#$-knows-where. They find themselves on an automated ship they christen 'Destiny', and the grittier realism, BSG-style hand-held camera-work, and balance between ongoing dramatic conflicts between crew-members and episodic adventure, make for some of the best episodes in the Stargate franchise. But... mistakes were made, and two seasons were all we got. After 17 seasons, Stargate was off the air.}

'Dark Matter' isn't a return to the stories Mullie and Mallozzi were an integral part of, but the same SF action and humor that they brought to Stargate makes Dark Matter a very welcome small-screen addition for fans. It's definitely closer to SG: Atlantis than SG:U, with sets and CGI that are well-executed but restricted to a budget much, MUCH lower than 'The Expanse'. But that's something the Dark Matter showrunners are well-accustomed to; they know that fascinating ideas and compelling characters trump special effects. If it were anyone else, I would have scoffed at the amnesia-based plot. Enough with the amnesia, already. It's so over-used that naming names is unnecessary, but Dark Matter was just one of FOUR new series that relied on amnesia-related storylines: Blindspot, Quantico and Wayward Pines are the other three, and it's possible I've forgotten a series or two myself... amnesia's getting a bit forgettable.

Like 'Pandorum', one of my favorite SF-horror films of the past decade -- and a bit like Wayward Pines, which isn't my favorite anything, but had its moments in Season 1 -- Dark Matter introduces us to six characters who have lost their memory after entering 'cryo-sleep'... and one memory-deprived android. They awake one by one, just as the life-support is shutting down, and the confusion leads to conflicts and mistrust as they struggle to decide what to do next. Assigning themselves temporary numbers based on the order in which they woke, the writers and cast do an admirable job of making us immediately care about these nameless characters without histories. The obvious questions -- who they are, why they were together aboard the space vessel, who erased their memories, and why? -- gradually get answered throughout Season 1, at a pace that keeps viewers hooked without being frustrating (SG-1, like the X-Files, was a 90's pioneer of successfully balancing long, ongoing stories with old-school episodic adventure; it's difficult to get right, very easy to overdo and wind up 'Lost'). Even as most of those basic questions get full or partial answers, they usually lead to questions even more fascinating. Each character has a secret within the larger secret, buried within their locked-up mental vaults. 'Cracking them', to reveal each one of their backstories, always produces two questions for one answer... more tantalizing details, and puzzle pieces without a box-top reference to what the Big Picture looks like.

[WARNING: Spoilers! But... nothing the weekly commercials didn't spill... I think. Proceed with Caution.]
None of the actors are well-known, but they're still recognizable to many. They mostly belong to long-time veterans of the Vancouver film and television acting scene, which is the capital of Science Fiction and Genre TV for decades: Star Trek - TNG, Star Trek - DS9, Star Trek - Voyager, Star Trek - Enterprise, The X-Files, Stargate: SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis, Stargate: Universe, Supernatural, Firefly, and so on. Even the show's youngest star, Jodelle Ferland, has had multiple Stargate and Supernatural guest-roles, and she's barely out of her teens, if she is at all. Still, it's a testament to great casting that the seven main stars possess the instant chemistry that they do, cohering as a social unit on-screen with far-better chemistry than 99% of the big-budget, network-produced ensemble dramas on the air. When the adorably polite and deadly android discovers the name of the ship, its crew, and its mission, the characters get their first unpleasant shock: the 'Raza' is a ship full of killers. One's who have cultivated a reputation as something like a supernatural force of destruction. In a future where human colonists have settled distant solar systems, made possible by FTL (Faster Than Light)-capabilities, Massive Corporations rule the outer corners of Human exploration in search of rich natural resources to claim as their own and exploit. Claim disputes that can't be settled with money, far beyond the rule of law, are settled by way of violent skirmishes employing company militias. But when rich-enough claims are discovered on planets owned not by competing companies, but by colonists who call it home, any hold-outs refusing to sell are dealt with brutally and thoroughly. In order to avoid leaving any proof of involvement that might convince law-enforcement to make the trip and investigate, the companies hire mercenaries instead... mercenaries like the Raza. They learn that the guns on board are not just a shipment, but tools of their trade; what's worse, they were hired to use the guns against a group of honest settlers who refuse to be driven off. After meeting their intended targets, the group comes to an unanimous decision: the profiles found by the Android, depicting monstrous killers without morals, no longer has any connection to who they are. They have a second chance to leave their messed-up stories behind, and start writing a new one. To that end, they not only refuse to kill the colonists, but take up arms to protect them when the company militia comes to do the job the Raza never did.

I'll leave it there, with the broad brushstrokes of the first two episodes. It gets better as it goes, and it's far from a bad start. Is this series going to sit next to The Wire, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Rome, Deadwood, Broadchurch, The Sopranos, or Boardwalk Empire, in the Valhalla of Genius TV? Oh, hell no. Not remotely. It doesn't even really belong in the same zip-code as The Walking Dead or The Expanse. It's just a fun, engaging series that never takes itself seriously. Why would a spaceship be equipped with a swordsman's dojo, or better yet, a swordsman? They wanted a Jason Momoa/Ronan-type character, because sword-fighting in space is cool, is totally impractical. On the other hand, firing guns isn't the best option inside a pressurized canister with thin metal layers separating life from a horrible death by vacuum, so... maybe swords aren't completely impractical. As I said at the outset, Stargate began as a guilty pleasure, but I kicked the guilt early on, once I realized the utter crap people are watching now. They don't even feel guilty about it, but they probably should. A little. Dark Matter not that original, it's kind of low budget, and there's no 'Oh S***', GoT-level intensity. It's just pure SF awesomeness that I could watch repeatedly. I HAVE watched it repeatedly.

EDIT: Then Season 2 happened... WTF?! Now I don't care if there's a Season 3 or not. Hell, kill Dark Matter, and resurrect Stargate: Atlantis or SGU.",1466726400,8,11887,5.079836233367452
7697762,5,B01D5MQPNU,"I think this show (which I'm pretty sure is by the same parent company) is taking the place of Lost Girl, now that that show has completed its run. While that show  was fantasy with magic and all kinds of interesting elves and shape changers and evil people of all sorts along with the heroes and heroines, this new show-Dark Matter is pure science fiction. But just like the first show this one is extremely well written and well acted. It is very engaging and a lot of fun to watch! Of course season one ended on a big cliffhanger and I can hardly wait for season two!

It is kind of fun to see the woman who played the the human Dr. in Lost Girl playing an android in this show. She does a really good job! I'd also see some similarities in the stowaway girl of the new show and Kinzey from the first show. Not too many similarities so as to spoil it, I really adored the new girl, and in fact I really like the whole cast. Love the writing- mysteries that span it's overall arc yet enjoying the stories encased in each single episode.

It's been a while since I've enjoyed a science fiction show like this one-one that is just pure science fiction without horror and gore!

One last note: I don't appreciate the makers of the DVD literally forcing us to watch their ""commercials"" so I just have to turn the sound off and waited out to get to where I can press play all on each disc.

7697764,5,B01D5MQPNU,"Yes it is low budget at times, and not all the actors are top notch. But i really liked this show. It sort of reminds me of farscape at times.",1465776000,,142,3.7666666666666666
7697765,4,B01D5MQPNU,"I must start this review by professing a slight bias- I am very partial to space and space opera series and films.  Blame it on the timing of my arrival to this planet if you must; I was just old enough to remember Star Wars in the theater, had a Mr. Spock snack tray around that time, remember watching Buck Rogers regularly on prime time and am always suspect of any era in civilization where there isn't a current Star Trek series on television.

However, at the same time this bias doesnt make me overly generous to the genre in these reviews either.  In fact, maybe the opposite.  I tend to hold them in very high esteem indeed.  Especially in this, the era following a long absence from space opera TV.

That being said, these are days to rejoice as suddenly shows like this one, Killjoys, Ascension and The Expanse (with talk of a new Star Trek series on the horizon) have finally put an end to the drought of space opera-less TV.  Makes sense too given the popularity of space scifi theatrically with reboots of Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens etc.

All of this takes us back to Dark Matter; the 2015 Canadian scifi series created by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, based on their Dark Horse comic book of the same name.  At this time the 13-episodes comprising the first season are all that have been released and thus this review will focus on them exclusively.  Good news is that a second season has been ordered up by SyFy and is set to debut July 1, 2016.

While interesting, none of this really tells us much about the show itself.  For those who don't know, it is the telling of a crew coming out of stasis with absolutely no memory of their lives prior to entering cryo on board a technically advanced ship hurling through space.  Without memory of proper names, they call themselves One through Six, based on the order in which they awoke, and a 7th member, an android they call Android makes up the ships accompaniment (so much for the writers having to struggle to come up with clever names in this one).

As you might guess from the short summary above, the show plays off a heavy mystery element as the viewer often discovers truths and past-reveals right alongside the character in question.  By and large, the tactic works.  Cliffhangers abound (both between episodes and even commercial break spots) and often times angles you think youll have figured out take a healthy twist.  However, unlike other mystery-based series (ah hem, Lost), Dark Matter never piles on the unanswered questions at a rate faster than it answers questions past.  In other words, there is a lot of resolve here as you progress.  Thankfully.

Fans of tech-heavy science fiction and hard space, the type of which 99% of Star Trek The Next Generation episodes thrived upon, may not be overly impressed with Dark Matters penchant for making light of the physics and technology at play in their universe in favor of the more trivial and personal conflicts between characters.  Everyone else should find the setting plenty sufficient for a scifi serial.  If comparisons are your thing, the pacing of shows like Farscape and Stargate Universe are pretty accurate.
So with so much praise, why not a 5-star rating?  Well, to be honest, the 13-episodes making up the first season are a lot like reviewing two different shows entirely.  The show starts off a little rocky in terms of acting and delivery especially.  Characters like Android feel clunky (no pun intended).  The interplay between characters is also fairly stiff and not entirely believable.

However, right around the halfway point of the first season, things improve exponentially.  The plots become much tighter, the actors apparently find their rhythm and the cliff hangers, which are always present, become much more cliffy. Or maybe its hangy?

A few of my complaints are consistent throughout- namely the lack of alien races present.  You visit multiple habitable planets and space stations throughout the 13-episodes and there is absolutely nothing outside of English-speaking humans.  I suppose there have been plenty of very successful space operas in the past that have followed this formula but it would have been really nice to meet up with the occasional otherworldly galactic inhabitant.

All in all, Dark Matter is a very promising sign of the times.  Im personally looking forward to the second season and would advise anyone who isn't full vested into the show after the first few episodes to keep pushing on.  It certainly gets pretty intense by the conclusion.",1465430400,12,4531,4.803870967741935

It's simple but, not
It's a update of the dirty dozen minus half mixed with classic sci-fi elements and throw in a little Memento
The Cast is strong
Roger R. Cross (Six) is a great character actor that always tends to play bad guys (you may have seen him in Continuum, Orphan Black, The Strain) among much more he reminds me of Danny Trejo
He's a Huge reason why i stuck with this!

Zoie Palmer (The Android) better known for Lauren in Lost Girl
(Great Choice with all the Android in the last 35 years on tv and in films) She does good in a way she kind of holds back but, I guess she has to for this role to work!

Jodelle Ferland (Five) She looked so familiar then i looked her up on imdb wow
Carrie (2002) tv movie, which i actually like i know i suck! she was in the dead like me (Pilot)
she played Mary Jensen Kingdom Hospital ,
she played Sharon / Alessa in Silent Hill ,
and she did v/o work as the little sister in Bio Shock II
and she's only 21 that's the work i know her from super talented actress
She's awesome I think they dyed her hair so she didn't look like Melissa O'Neil sister/mother
Most Gamer's/Horror Fans will know her.....

Everyone else i never seen before or i just don't recognize there previous work no matter
they all are very good
Marc Bendavid (One)
Melissa O'Neil (Two)
Anthony Lemke (Three)
Alex Mallari Jr. (Four)

The Six of them wake up with no memories of who they are and you are given small bits of info little by little throughout the first 12 episodes
It might sounds lame on paper it's not it's actually very well written and enjoyable
The cast have to sell a lot of whats going on (There are flash back sequences and different hints)
you learn out of the gate that there a band of wanted Criminals (that are in fact hired guns each one with different back stories) some not who they claim they are
Most of the effects are really good for the Budget (the inside of the ship looks really Organic like the Original Alien Film)
I'd go as far as saying the over all Digital F/X are much better stacked against the final Season of TNT's Falling Skies
a lot of the F/X on Dark Matter look Polished and detailed (not rushed)
Go out of your way and watch at least the first three episodes and get a feel for it
If it's something your enjoy you're know it pretty quick

It was renowned for a second season! The 2-part season finally added more questions then answers
But, it was actually a compelling finally. that was done the right way (with a Twist that was kind of like The Thing) I mean the build up!
with SyFi winding down Lost Girl, Haven, & Continuum
and Helix Getting canceled after only a second season SyFi needs Strong Exclusive Properties
Hopefully Dark Matter can be one of those properties
I will without a doubt snag this on blu ray once it drops in price a bit
These is another great example that if you give Sy Fi the ball they will knock it out of the park
this is there 2015 Dominion..... Hopefully more tv viewers give it a real chance and don't count it out on the strange cheap name 9.2/10",1462233600,5,3112,4.25
8755005,3,B01D5MQPNU,"Don't judge Dark Matter too harshly by its first season. Very poor cinematography, lighting, directing, and very limited CGI causes most of the season to look rather low budget. Only toward the end do we finally begin to see improved CGI and much improved directing and storytelling.

If you stay with this series it gets a LOT better toward the end of the first season and definitely improves in season two.

8755007,4,B01D5MQPNU,"At its core, good science fiction must have the same elements that good mysteries do.
That is to say it needs well-thought-out characters, interesting plots, and a few twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing, which, in turn, helps to keep its audience invested in the narrative.
""Dark Matter"" has all three of those elements plus a fourth: When they are rudely awakened from stasis because of a life-threatening on-board  emergency, its crew members cannot remember who they are or why they are on a mysterious spaceship cruising through the galaxy on a course to an unknown destination.
Why they have a collective case of amnesia is a mystery; what their mission is, and how they came to be together are also mysteries.
It's an intriguing concept; one that helps make ""Dark Matter"" a cut above many other sci-fi programs that have come along in recent years.
That's a tribute to the writers who, throughout the season, do a very good job of gradually revealing who the crew members are and what their original mission was. The writers also do a good job of balancing action scenes with scenes that allow viewers to get inside the heads of the main characters. As a bonus, they also have added just enough humor to balance out those action and introspection scenes.
The writers have also done a pretty good job when it comes to creating a universe in which gigantic corporations essentially run things unchecked by any governmental agencies. These corporations have their own armies and run roughshod over anything or anyone who gets in their way. Given the current state of affairs on Planet Earth, that's a believable scenario.
The series falls a little short, however, when it comes to the continuity of the narrative. I won't discuss that in detail because to do so would probably reveal too much about that narrative and, thus, spoil the experience for those that have not yet seen the show. I will say, however, that there is a surprise twist in the cliffhanger ending to this season that left me shaking my head because it felt like the writers had decided that they needed something to shake up the narrative even if it meant introducing a whole new storyline.
Despite that, this is very good science fiction and worth 4.5 stars.",1528070400,,2242,4.778350515463917

8755009,3,B01D5MQPNU,"A crew of six people wake up out of suspended animation on a twenty-sixth century space ship with no memories of who they are. As they try to figure things out, the android on the ship (who looks like a slim, blonde woman) attacks them. They manage to shut it down and slightly reprogram the android so it no long attacks them, but works with them. Though much of the ship's information has been erased, their current destination is still programed in--a mining colony on the far edge of space. The ship's cargo is a literal boatload of weapons. When they land on the planet, they discover the locals are independent miners who are about to be attacked by the Raza, a horrible race of giant lizard people who have a reputation for mercilessly dealing with whomever they are sent after. The reputation is both deserved and vague, since no one has ever survived an attack by the Raza. The amnesiac crew decide to help out the miners (the weapons in their ship's hold must be the shipment ordered by the miners to defend themselves, right?). When they get back to the ship, the android fills them in on some of the erased data that she's been able to recover from the ship's memory. They are all wanted men and women, and they've committed lots of horrible crimes. Oh, and the name of their ship is the Raza. That's where the first episode ends.

So the pilot episode make a really great story and set up for the series. The only flaws are the clear debt owned to Joss Whedon's Firefly and the mediocre writing later in the season. Two of the characters are basically Jayne Cobb and Kaylee as amnesiacs. The crew flies around doing jobs for various corporations though things often don't go according to plan, a fate they share with the crew of the Serenity. So the show is a little derivative, but if you are going to steal, why not steal from the best? The initial set up leads viewers to believe these people are horrible people who maybe have a chance at a new, better (at least morally if not financially) life. As their backstories are revealed, they don't seem like the cutthroat monsters their reputation makes them out to be. Also, the characters are occasionally inconsistent and the plots are a little ludicrous. The final episode has an Agatha Christie whodunit feel that is not consistent with the rest of the show. Logic isn't always the strongest point in the show.

Even with its flaws, the show is still entertaining. The android is endearing with its directness and seeming innocence. The characters are fun if not entirely original. The acting is okay and the special effects are fine.

Not a great or original show, but entertaining enough to be recommended. Even with its ridiculously implausible cliffhanger ending (did I say the writing is mediocre?), I'll give season two a try.",1514073600,,2799,4.639112903225806
