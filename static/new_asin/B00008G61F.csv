1843049,4,B00008G61F,"Catherine Naglestad is reason enough to buy this dvd. She plays the strong woman, who has the power to turn lovers into beasts, and yet is plainly vulnerable. Her singing and acting vividly portray passion and heartbreak.

While Handel might have found the costumes and sets to be strange, he would have loved the way his music fared in this production. The modern costumes and sets actually fit with the story quite well. Today's audiences surely will appreciate the use of business suits by women to disguise themselves as men.

With its many twists and turns one might need to watch this opera several times to fully appreciate the entire story. With Handel's music well sung and well played, that will be a pleasure for me.

Watched on a 16:9 ratio television, the picture is perfect.",1120694400,7,788,4.779411764705882
1843050,3,B00008G61F,"First off - had none of the problems that Scott encountered with the image - my player adjusted fine to a 16:9 image well presented.  On musical grounds, this is a more-than-competent reading of Handel's classic opera, with some fine singing throughout.  Naglestad is a lovely Alcina, and other principles are strong (notable standout is Mahnke's Oberto). Conductor Hacker coaxes a good reading out of the Stuttgart forces.  The production is very modern - no forests and trees here, but a decaying palace with a great ""Alice in Wonderland"" mirror framing the center.  Yes, there's some gratuitous sex and others may complain this isn't Handel's Alcina, but it held my interest throughout.  A very good production of a great work.",1115424000,17,730,5.05
1843051,1,B00008G61F,"ArtHaus used to have problems with their opera DVDs being riddled with excessive digital artifacting for the price.  Now the artifacting is down to a minimum, but the 16x9 authoring is not compatible with all players and may produce an anamorphic squash no matter how you adjust your player.  As a result, I was not able to get much past the overture, so I can't comment on the production itself, which is in modern-dress, though the overture is well-played.",1113177600,4,458,4.784810126582278
1843052,3,B00008G61F,"... but don't buy it. You'll hardly be tempted to watch it twice. The staging is somewhat lurid and profoundly irrelevant to the music, but that doesn't bother me as much as the burden the staging puts on the singers, torturing their timbres. I watched this DVD that 'mandatory' once, several years ago. I wasn't thrilled, musically or visually if I remember correctly, and I wouldn't review it now but for the fact that another ""beast in the jungle"" of amazon pressed me for an opinion of it. Among the Handel DVDs in my collection, it ranks toward the bottom, though not as awful as the ""Ariodante"" by the English National Opera, that absolute nadir of tasteless stagings.",1273708800,3,674,4.720338983050848
1843053,4,B00008G61F,"All the singers have excellent voices, but Naglestad's is particularly wonderful, strong and melodic, an especially worthwhile trait for Handel operas. The sound quality is great for a DVD; someone really took care to see that miking was done properly. You can really enjoy the singing, and even on my cheap movie sound system the music was goose-bump inducing.

On the downside, the quasi-pornographic staging alluded to by so many other reviewers (Ms. Naglestad really shows us her (ahem) lungs) is mildly distracting, but not nearly so much so in my opinion as the  hair-pulling clothes-tearing depressive melancholia evinced by almost all the roles. It just gets a bit much after a while. For myself, who has yet to see a traditional staging of this opera, I would have appreciated something less avante-guard. I thought the setting, which is a single room of what appears to be a derelict manor house, was quite boring by the end.

Overall grade: A for singing and sound; F for staging. Might you not just as well buy a good CD?",1235692800,5,1033,4.824858757062147
1843054,5,B00008G61F,"Excellent Opera by Handel, if you love Baroque period you are going to enjoy. Stunning production. I strongly recommend this DVD",1225324800,4,128,5.142857142857143
1843055,5,B00008G61F,"I can strongly recommend this ravishing performance (great acting, wonderful cinematography, pretty good singing), which will take you straight to the heart of Handel's marvelous music even if you find the eroticism of the production offensive.

Government subsidies for an opera performance are about 120 euros per seat in Germany. These subsidies have encouraged some in-your-face and silly productions, where the stage directors treat the audience and composer with contempt.  What is the artistic point in having singers sitting on a row of toilets in a Rossini opera? This radical 1999 Stuttgart performance of Alcina is an exception to the observation that government subsidies frequently corrupt the arts. (There are so many exceptions, that this ""observation"" does not deserve to be called a rule.)

I bought this Alcina because it was inexpensive and the only DVD of the opera, but with some misgivings because of the contradictory and confusing reviews on this site.  Which of the reviewers are right?

There may be a hidden message in the conflicting reviews. A frequent theme is along the lines of ""marvelous music, but I hated all the on-screen porn"". What I think these reviewers may be misunderstanding is that the on-screen porn is accentuating their response to the music. They may be misinterpreting their own reactions.

Another of the complaints made is that the performance is not faithful to the anonymously authored libretto that Handel used. Having seen a traditional performance of this opera, I can't get terribly excited about lack of fidelity to the libretto, which has an unusually complicated and silly plot even by the standards of early 18th century operas.

The theme of the opera is that Alcina, a sorceress, uses sex to transform men into beasts. However, Alcina has become dangerously infatuated with her latest lover, Ruggerio, a knight.  Bradamante, Ruggerio's old lover, arrives dressed up as a man. At the close of the opera Ruggerio returns to Bradamante, now revealed as  a woman, and defeats Alcina's stratagems and is able to rescue her trapped ex-lovers. There are also a number of subplots.

What I think the stage and video directors of this opera have done is ignore the overall silliness of the plot and make each moment in the opera as dramatic as possible and emphasise the theme of the opera, which is itself quite serious, being the power of sex - and also give us an approximation of the thrill an audience in 1735 would have experienced with this seductive and over-the-top music.

In 1735 the opera would have been performed in something that approximated contemporary dress at that time, in a small intimate theatre, where the indrawn breaths of the singers could be heard and one or more of the singers was a castrato.  An 18th century audience must have been greatly intrigued by the fact that the singer performing Ruggiero, Alcina's great seducer, was in fact a castrato. The DVD recreates for a modern audience some of the sexual tension and ambiguity that would have been experienced by 18th century audiences.

One reviewer, who had seen this production live made the interesting comment that the DVD was better than the theatrical experience. The great cinematography in this DVD has been largely overlooked by the reviewers here. The frames  that are shown at the beginning while the overture plays are immediately seductive, an old overturned chair, a bowl of cherries, some discarded military boots - they are as lyrical as the frames from an Ozu film. Catherine Nagelstad as Alcina is luminously and desperately beautiful, like an updated Louise Brooks from the 1929 silent movie ""Pandora's Box"" - what a performance! And Alice Coote as Ruggiero is boyish and playful and charming - a wonderful foil for Nagelstad's Alcina. Early in the opera Ruggerio makes explicit sexual advances to all the singers on stage, both male and female, while Alcina, her lover watches with apparent approval. I personally felt uncomfortable, and this was not an episode that is in the libretto - but this underlined at the start of the opera what it is all about - the destructive and creative power of sex.

As an experiment I tried listening to this performance without the visuals. It was not the same.",1219968000,23,4255,5.015602836879433
1843056,5,B00008G61F,"Alice Coote is brilliant in all of her performances, and this one is no exception!  I was fortunate to see her perform ""Carmen"" in London last October, and am going to see her ""Idomeneo"" in San Francisco this fall!  She is fantastic and incredibly gifted!  Buy this, seat back and enjoy the performance!",1213747200,3,303,4.679245283018868
1843057,5,B00008G61F,"Several reviewers have suggested that this production is little better than ""porn,"" consequently entirely inappropriate and guilty of misrepresenting Handel's immaculate conception.  On the contrary, ""Alcina,"" one of the great Handelian opere serie, is the perfect place to introduce this kind of earth-shattering antithesis to the anticipated staid and dutiful production.  It almost goes without saying that the librettist (anonymous, adapted from Riccardo Broschi, based on Ariosto's ""Orlando furioso"") saw the ""feminine,"" as exemplified in the character of Alcina herself, as dangerous and subversive, oversexed and under-reasoned, whereas the ""masculine,"" as exemplified in the character of Oronte, he saw as moral and upright, possessed of perfect propriety in matters sexual and socio-cultural.  The libretto, through the disruption of Alcina's spell over her male ""victims"" and the destruction of the sorceress herself, depicts a victory of this idealized masculine over the idealized feminine.

How could any modern producer not see this arrangement as grotesque, as the creation of men for the benefit of a male-dominated society?  The production, therefore, outwardly turns that arrangement and the society that created it on its head by suggesting that the victory of the idealized ""masculine""--seen in the CONVERSION of Ruggiero from loving Alcina to loving Bradamante, and also from lesbianism to heterosexuality--is a travesty: a murder of beauty, a rapacious erasure of that part of the truth of the human journey that reveals itself through desire.

But who is speaking or singing this reversal, this bold assertion that the idealized feminine was better, had ALWAYS been better, than the idealized masculine?  Is it Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito, the directors, for introducing a topless aria or a forced marriage sequence where the libretto suggests no such thing, or is it Handel for creating in the role of Alcina an overwhelming vocal presence?  Does she not overturn, through the sheer power of the vocal writing offered up to her, the high estimation the libretto would seem to place on the idealized masculine?  If so, then the directors Wieler and Morabito have done nothing more--through their emphasis on the undeniable physical allure of societal signifiers of femininity--than elect to hear Handel over the lexical clamor of his librettist. (Thanks to Carolyn Abbate for the spirit of this!)

On the one hand, it should be remembered that this production's upsetting of a perceived historical meaning is partially the accomplishment of a man--Sergio Morabito--and, therefore, in some way no less grotesque in its idealization of the feminine than the demonization of the same in Handel's time.  On the other hand, Jossi Wieler (a woman) surely changes this dynamic, and finally it is Catherine Nagelstad (Alcina), Alice Coote (Ruggiero), and Helene Schniederman (Bradamante) who provide the physical source of the lasting sounds and images of the production, as even negative reviews of this DVD attest.  It therefore seems to me that what has emerged through this ""Alcina"" is in fact a reassertion of the victory of the female voice over what is still in many ways a frustratingly male-dominated industry.  I incriminate myself.",1179878400,9,3262,5.461232604373757
1843058,3,B00008G61F,"The singing is quite good in this video except for the men - the tenor is awful and the bass is barely adequate.  However, the five ladies are all very enjoyable, particularly the Alcina and the Ruggiero.  Coote, as Ruggiero, is very believable as a man and her acting is excellent.  The sets are nothing to write home about but neither are they ugly or distracting.  The costumes are fine except I saw way too much of Alcina's breasts.  There is too much heavy petting in the direction, as though someone were trying to show us they weren't afraid to show women kissing each other and touching private areas, alot... and then some more...and even longer...  That bit seemed a bit childish but for the most part, I enjoyed the video, and had a hard time pausing just to get up for a minute.  If the tenor had been good, I probably would give it another star, but he was really bad.",1169251200,6,881,4.401234567901234
1843059,4,B00008G61F,"For anyone who's interested (which should be all males in their right mind) Alcina's aria of exposure, 'ma cloth bosom pop out', begins at the one hour, twenty-five minute and thirty-seven second mark (or to make things easy, chapter thirty nine). After that there's a five minute wait before the first bosom pops. Interested parties might want to skip ahead. I waited of course (because nobody told me when it would happen).

The aria is actually called 'Ah, mio cor! Schernito sei!' (Ah! My heart! You are scorned!) and it's a great one. Anyone watching it just to see Catherine Naglestad partially nude should end up mesmerized enough by the music and her performance of it to (almost) forget that her [...] end up exposed. The piece is a dramatic tour de force for her and for Catriona Smith who, though she doesn't sing, serves as a counterpoint for the action. Naglestad captures the character's fury and her emotional vulnerability beautifully. Her physical exposure serves that. Ultimately it helps in showing the imperious, spoiled and wanton Alcina as a multi-faceted human being more deserving of sympathy than scorn.

The cast is brilliant. Michael Ebbecke has the role that's both the least and most pivotal to the opera. His voice is the harshest of the cast members but he uses it to convey an air of authority. Claudia Mahnke brings the uncertainty and passion of youth to the role of Oberto. Her voice is rich and, very powerful. Rolfe Romei has a strong tenor voice that's never harsh. He brings complexity, insecurity and sexual ambiguity to a role that (under many directors) could have been a throwaway. Catriona Smith and Helene Schneiderman are standouts. Catriona Smith is wonderfully vulnerable as Alcina's sister, Morgana. Her pain from the abuse by her lover and her sister is tangible. The love she has for both of them is never less than real as well. She sings in bell like tones that suggest despair or passion with equal aplomb. Helene Schneiderman has that wonderful middle range unique to mezzo sopranos that's as much a caress as delivery of song. And she's an extremely expressive singer. Her use of body language is exceptional as well. It's largely due to her work that this production is so emotionally and erotically charged.

But the production belongs to Alice Coote, Catherine Naglestad, (conductor) Alan Hacker and the Staatorchester Stuttgart. Alice Coote has a rich mezzo soprano voice that's positively silken. Her turn as Ruggerio, the bewitched lover who finally scorns the temptress Alcina, is entirely convincing. And she sings it so well ...hers is a voice that every listener will want to hear more of. Catherine Naglestad is mesmerizing as the bewitching Alcina. She is at turns powerful and heartrendingly vulnerable. Her sensuality borders on feral. And her singing is something to marvel at. Nothing defies her range. The ways she has of shading tones are rich and varied and her notes soar over the stage. Alan Hacker does a beautiful job with both the orchestra and the singers. His interpretation is elegant and refined but never lacking in drive. The score, as he presents it, supports the singers and the eroticism implied in the production. The highest compliment I can give to it is that it becomes more of a joy to listen to as it becomes more familiar.

The only problem with the staging lies with the backdrop. The set is laid out well but the wallpaper on it is too busy. It's not a problem when the camera is close to the action. But when the stage is shown in full view it's distracting. There are a couple of technical shortcomings as well. There are no scene selections in the main menu. A few of the subtitles have errors. The divisions between acts aren't marked during the performance. There's only one audio track (PCM Stereo) and there's a moment where most of it seems weighted toward only one channel. It doesn't last long but it is noticeable. And it's distracting. There are a pair of bad edits near the end too. The first appears to have been done to shorten what would have been a pause in the action. The second might have been to bring the lights down on camera before they actually went off on the stage. Whatever the case they make the finale of what was a very good production quite awkward.

But none of these points are worth missing this production over. The staging by Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito is (despite the two-for-one wallpaper) imaginative, effective and engaging. The most important characters are fully realized. The singing and acting is great. The PCM audio track is (with the exception of that single weak moment) vibrant and bright. Alice Coote, Catherine Naglestad and the orchestra under Alan Hacker, are magnificent. And of course, the music is glorious! This performance gets a five star rating and even the busy-as-an-ant colony wallpaper doesn't affect that. The loss of one star is due entirely to the technical shortcomings.

Baroque opera with a twist of erotica: it can't be beat.",1154044800,39,5001,4.850117096018735
1843060,3,B00008G61F,"I have no beef with the performance, it's excellent and does honor to Handel's genius.  The Stuttgart Staatsorchester under Alan Hacker and the cast did a fantastic job, but...geez, I wanna see porn I'll see porn. I'm no prude, there is a place for  purience, but ""Alcina"" ain't it.  The licentiousness of this performance is overwhelming, embarrassing, in very poor taste, and an insult to music lovers. If  you buy this DVD, turn you back to the screen or better still, save your money, get the CD and let your imagination soar with the music and when it's done you won't have a bad taste in your mouth.",1151625600,10,605,4.574074074074074
1843061,3,B00008G61F,"This is one of Haendel's most popular opera. An expansion of a side story from 'Orlando Furioso'. Ruggiero the soldier got spellbinded on Alcina's enchanted island. His fiancee and their wizard come to rescue. After much mistakened identities and preposterous romantic intrigues, everybody escape leaving Alcina broken both magically and emotionally.

The staging is bare and modern. Same set the whole show with 'thru the looking glass' huge window in the middle that sometimes offers the view to a back room, and sometimes to the real world from an enchanted illusion. Guys wear suits and gals wear dresses... of varying degrees of revealing-ness.

The romantic choreography goes overboard. I'm no prude, but this show gets quite distracting to me. I know that sexual seduction is a big part of the story, but this one crosses the fine line between showing a motif and show-casing it. That the singing actresses keep their clothes on is about the only thing that keeps it from being pornographic.

Come to think of it, Ms Naglestad's tops are of such see through quality that it really wouldn't have made that much difference had she taken it all off (and then there's that infamouse wardrobe malfunction during 'Ah, mio cor'...)! How she sings so well while doing all that is beyond me. A 'Di cor mio' that will send any male's heart pounding, a wonderful acting singer caught in a stage production that distracts away from her assets!

I was looking for a more melancholy 'Verdi prati,' but Ms Coote does better with the militant 'Sta nell'ircana' even with a rather average trill (the voice is strong but not very agile). Generally she is a good Ruggiero.

Ms Smith is a fine Morgana and copes well with the virtuosic 'Tornami a vegghiar' (unfortunately most of her acting has to do with molesting Bradamante), and Frau Schniedermann is vocally assured as Bradamante/Ricciaro but looks to be old enough to be Ruggiero's mom rather than his fiancee. The rest of the cast are ok.

An above average Alcina musically, to be sure, the musical performance earns the 3 stars. Tho I dislike how the stage direction seems to think it necessary to exploit sex scenes between beautiful singing actresses. It cheapens the show.",1151020800,10,2220,4.906666666666666
7982446,4,B00008G61F,"Great singing of a wonderful baroque Handel opera.  However, unfortunately sets seem unimaginative, for this lyrical and romantic story full of magic and intrigue.

I loved it!! This Stuttgart Opera version is an absolute joy. Alice Coote is the perfect Ruggiero. Catherine Nagelstad is a superb Alcina. The staging is modern and makes much of the variations possible in human sexuality. Combined with Handel's wonderful music and you are in for a treat. I own other recordings on CD, such as the magnificent Fleming/Graham/Dessay/William Christie performance which is astounding. However, this DVD is my favorite visually.

7982450,4,B00008G61F,"I don't know why everyone is so focused on the breasts. I thought this was going to be  some vulgar nasty production. It is simply a dress with a cut out in the breast area. Handel is well known for long repetitive arias and many productions of his works have awkward staging to try to keep the action moving. Such is the case here. It would be better if the singers had just stood still. That being said, Handel's music is awesome, all the singing is excellent and Alice Coots, as always, is phenomenal. The orchestra is also superb.  Because of the distracting awkward staging, the Fleming/Graham/ Dessay CD might be preferable but this is still worth buying, I think",1420329600,,669,4.566666666666666
7982451,1,B00008G61F,"If you are wondering how to turn Handel's opera of island magic and light romantic humor into a drawing room exercise in tedious alienation, then this is the DVD for you. The set and costuming give not the slightest hint that all the action takes place somewhere other than a the dingiest drawing room that must be in the dreariest corner of a forever pea soup London.

Each of the characters seems to be in their own emotionally sealed bubble, always singing and acting past each other. While all the other characters are merely dramatic windowless monads, Alcina's performance stands out as positively fingernails-on-a-chalkboard painful. Alcina's closest approach to bewitching charm is her embarrassing confusion of bare-chested hostility radiating in all directions in a failed attempt to convey  some kind of raw eroticism.

Where is the island? Where is the magic? Where are all the former lovers enchanted into wild beasts? Where is any hint of genuine passion or wit or humor? And because Alcina's magic has been lost throughout, the climatic tragedy of the unravelling of all of her powers is likewise lost.

The true value of this performance is how grateful it will make you for any other approach  to this opera you will ever come across.",1393027200,9,1251,4.966507177033493
7982452,4,B00008G61F,"This production of Handel's opera is simply filled with great music, wonderful singers and more nudity.

Even though this opera has some erotic elements and soprano, Catherine Naglestad who played Alcina had beautiful body to look at, she showed off far more than average opera singer.  Especially because her singing was so good, you just don't know what to think when she sung some of the Handel's most gorgeous arias wonderfully while she's practically topless.

She sung Alcina very impressively. Her sky penetrating beautiful soprano voice was expressive with different emotional shades and layers. Her singing confirmed my previous impression when mezzo-soprano, Joyce DeDonate sung the same role in the Alan Curtis's production that this role really meant to be and is best sung by higher soprano ranged singer.

Mezzo-soprano, Alice Coote who sung Ruggiero was also wonderful. When she sung Nero in ""L'Incoronazione di Poppea"" by Emmanuelle Haim, her voice was shallowly and didn't have enough weight. Nero's voice range might be just little too higher than her comfortable range. She sung this role at the mid-mezzo-soprano range in this production and it was very rich, full and beautiful with plenty of weight.

Soprano, Catriona Smith who played Alcina's sister, Morgana was very good also. Even though her voice had little hysteric texture which I don't care so much for but otherwise, she sung really well.

Helene Schneiderman who played Bradamante had lower, light and beautiful textured mezzo-soprano voice.

Rolfe Romei who played Oraonte had full, strong and very good flexible tenor voice.

Claudia Mahnke who played Oberto had very beautiful, light, clear, rich and powerful mezzo-soprano voice.

I don't' call the orchestration by Alan Hacker vibrant. But his orchestration was lively, detailed, affectionate and thoughtful.

In spite of all these musical high quality, one single item on the stage can ruin the whole show. And it's always wallpaper.

They had the ugly stage setting, which might not be so bad as long as there were no old style busy patterned wallpapers. They covered all over the walls. I think they tried to create run-down, nostalgic look to the stage but visually, it looked awfully dreaded and heavy. They also used a huge gold picture frame, which look like the two-way mirror and beyond it, there was another room as some psychological reflection tool. But this usage also made to look the whole production very claustrophobic that didn't match the Handel's open and vast music.  Also the details of the stage setting didn't make much sense. It must be harder for first time viewer to follow the story.

But musically, it was wonderful.

Musically, this performance is fine but not wonderful. Alice Coote is musically and visually convincing as Ruggiero. Catriona Smith as Morgana sounded wobbly and was not always on pitch. Naglestad's singing here is unobjectionable to quite good, although this role has been covered with more precision and emotional depth by both Renee Fleming and Joyce DiDonato.

As for the production, it definitely succeeds in showing the enclosed, hot-house quality of Alcina's island. Yes, there's plenty of sex. If you're a grownup, you've seen breasts before, so the fact that you'll see quite a lot of Alcina's in this performance is really neither here nor there.

Unfortunately this ""new statement"" of an opera seria is only slightly above brain-stem level.  What's new about any of this?  Some call it daring and innovative.  Others call it the easy route that takes little thinking on the part of the director, nothing more than a boring visual distraction from what could have been a great production with these fine singers.

Handel's music was incidental to what the director wanted to slop up on the stage.  True, the singing is often excellent, but musicality is lost in the bizarre visuals.  If directors cannot remember that opera is also about the music and not just the visual aspects, then they are not doing their jobs.  The picture on the cover of this DVD tells you what you what was important in this production.  Handel almost got in the directors way.
