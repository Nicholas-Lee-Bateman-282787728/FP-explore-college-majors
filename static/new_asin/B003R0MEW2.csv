4175901,1,B003R0MEW2,"I love Grey's Anatomy, but HATED this episode!  It was so painful to watch that I stopped after I realized the entire episode was going to be a series of ridiculous musical numbers.  What the hell got into the writers, or were they on strike?  PLEASE, PLEASE do not ruin another episode of this normally fantastic series!",1308614400,4,321,4.5964912280701755
4175902,5,B003R0MEW2,"The first several seasons focus on the cast getting over the traumatic finale from season 6.  In fact, unlike some other such events from previous seasons, they choose not to gloss over it which is a good decision.  A good nine episodes or more focus on the fallout and then it's on to other topics.  Several relationships are tested, especially Derek and Mer at the end but this shouldn't be a total surprise as Dempsey has stated he will only do one more season.  New female actresses are brought in (even an irritating love interest for Alex) but none of them measure up to the ghost of Izzy who was arguably the best looking and endearing female actress next to Pompeo.  The musical episode was better than expected and I suspect it was a bit of a steal from GLEE.  STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; THEMES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: September 2010 to June 2011; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.",1308614400,,933,4.491124260355029
4175903,5,B003R0MEW2,"I wasn't sure how they would handle this season after the shooting last season. I thought the show might go in the wrong direction and it would be the start of the end. This season was amazing. I thought they handled the fallout of last seasons finale really well. I love the character stories that ran throughout the season. Yang seemed to take more of a centre stage this season, which was great as she is one of my favourite characters. There are one or two tiny new characters, but I think they are more for future seasons and were added to sort of get the ball rolling on next seasons stories. Meredith had a fantastic storyline this season, which sort of came alive towards the second half. Karev centred episodes were actually my favourite. Hopefully at some point something will actually go right for him! The characters continue to get better. There was not a dull episode in the season. The musical was really funny and I think we can establish who can sing and who can't by the way Callie basically sings nearly every song. An amazing season, which can only get better next year.",1307836800,23,1090,4.538071065989848
4175904,5,B003R0MEW2,"I Love that I can watch it when ever I want. I am impatient and I didn't want to wait till September when the season 7 of Greys came out on DVD, so I bought it so it would stream to computer right away. I watch it when ever I have a free time. I absolutely love it!!",1307404800,,266,3.603448275862069
4175905,3,B003R0MEW2,"I have been a stop the world Grey's is on fan since the beginning, however, this season was no longer ""must see TV"" for me.  Callie is not(and has never been) my favorite character and she seems to have been the featured character for many of the episodes.  I really didn't care about her, her drama with Mark, Arizona and the entire baby business.  I actually turned it off...really couldn't stand it.

The music episode was unwatchable...turned that one off, too. What were you thinking?

I agree with one of the other reviewers that they seemed to have lost touch with the original interns and they're the ones who made the show what it was.

April is the annoying person at work that you just can't stand to be around and now, she's chief resident???  Really?  Callie was selected over Bailey, too, and they undid that.  There's still hope.

I watched the finale last night and thought it was the best episode in a long time.  They came back to their roots and redeemed the entire season for me.",1305849600,7,999,4.5251396648044695
4175906,5,B003R0MEW2,"I was a huge Grey's fan for the first two seasons, kept with it for the third and fourth, and lost complete interest in it during the fifth and sixth season, only watching the begining and end of those seasons. I thought this season would be the same, but I am happy  to say that Grey's has become a must-watch show for me again.

I am writing this before the season ends, so my review may change depending upon how the rest of the season goes, but I've really enjoyed this season so far. They didn't introduce new characters this season, which I think helped, and instead spent the time focusing on the relationships and personal growth of the already established characters. Though Dr. (Meredith) Grey is still a main character, I really think the characters of Dr. Yang and Dr. Karev shine in this season, as well as Dr. Torres, who the final episodes really seem to focus on.",1304467200,5,879,4.4875

4175908,5,B003R0MEW2,"SPOILERS BELOW WARNING WARNING!!!!!!

I know it may be a little early to review this now but this is just for the show, i will update when have the DVD.
After last seasons Huge Tense and at times scary season finale, Grey's returns albit a little slow but still brillient. We get to find out how everyone is coping with the events, everyone deals with it in their own way and i think Cristinas was the most absorbing, i actually thought she would quit Seattle Grace Mercy West but thankfully she did not.

There are not a lot of new characters this season which is a good thing as the cast is large enough as it is, the addition of April i love she was a great character in the last season and i am glad to see more of her and Jackson (i am not happy about him and Lexi though) with this season i was hoping that a few of my fave couples would stay to together Lexi and Mark but we can still hope for those two. Speaking of Mark i love the fact that he and Callie are having a Baby and that Arizona came back (Arizona and Callie are perfect).

The season so far has been brillient and even after 7 years these chracters never get boring their relationships seem close to me so when couples break up it is hard to watch, i was litritlly crying when Arizona Left,
There have been three stand out episodes this season

First was the documentry episode, it was different and this is a season where different is good. the documentry episode was funny intense and good old grey's

Second The golden hour; it was great to get a whole episode just on meridith (i am not happy Shonda has not given her a baby yet but she gives Callie one them almost kills her off) Speaking of Mer i would really like more time to the three original interns

Third The Musical Episode: alot of people did not like this one but it was easily the best of the season, it was intense and sad i cried when they sang Chasing Cars and Callie wanted Baileys hand. The music fit in perfectly and at times it did not feel like a musical which was good. Till this episode i had no idea how talented the cast was, I did think this ep was the best but everyone does have their own opinoin right.

UPDATE

Fourth Best Episode is Callie and Arizonas Wedding was AMAZING and it was Great how it showed marrige has nothing to do with god and that it is just a judge. The way it changed from Merders and Calzonas was Amazing and finally my two favirote Couples Got together, Whoever hates this episode is just WEIRD

Am Loving the TEDDY storyline i really want her to be with the dying guy

I am counting down the days till the finale of this season but i am just scared that Teddy's husband may die. it just seems since his introduction he is going to be Denny 2.0 and i would be really pissed if Shonda did this because she would just be recyling old storylines. Izzie needs to come back and finsh with Alex i actuall hated Izzie last season, i mean Kathrine Heigl quit the show at about 6 episodes into the last season i just wished Shinda would have killed her off and kept George.

Lots of people think Grey's is getting to old but i for one think it is still on top and enjoyable i can't wait for the eigth season but i do hope Grey's does not go past a ninth season because at that point it may get old. I will be pruchasing this the day it comes out nd rewatching this whole season again as it has so far been the second best (Behind the Second that is DENNY :{
UPDATE
Having just got the series on DVD i can say the Finale was amazing, it might have been slow compared to the previous but that was good i don't think i could have sat through another shooting or giant accident. I think that things will be very different in season 8 especially between Mer and  Derek can't believe they way it ended.

The dvd itself is brillent am glad to see they kept to the fold out packaging cause some comapny keep changeing the DVDs and it does not look good in a collection, the special features are pretty good, the extended musical is okay the added scenes are good but not great.
Overall 10/10 these last two season have felt like good old Grey's and make up for seasons 4 and 5",1301616000,17,4136,4.174404015056462

4176018,4,B003R0MEW2,"The show is starting to repeat issues now.  Everybody who comes to the hospital either has a tumor, a neurological problem, heart problem, or lacks insurance.  I am also sick of them forcing the g@y agenda on the viewers.  We have Calliope and Arizona and every season some gay male couple comes to the hospital with some issue connected to being mistreated because they are gay.

The new set of interns are hired because of their looks which makes the show lose even more credibility.  The best episodes are the ones that focus on Christina and how she deals with her issues. Basically, Christina is having a hard time overcoming the fact that she performed surgery while the hospital was being shot up.

Note 1:  Many of the mistakes made in the OR are due to the surgeons either arguing with friends during procedures or the surgeon trying to appease their lover in the OR.  The hospital should have a policy precluding lovers and friends from being in the OR or the observation room.

Note 2:  Rhimes and her team recycle actors.  Y?  There are so many unknowns needing a job that it makes no sense for Rhimes to recycle the actors.  The Scandal Cyrus actor is Meridith's father on Greys.  The Cyrus actor boyfriend appeared on Greys as a patient.  Teddy's husband on Greys is Olivia popes boyfriend on Scandal.  Also several of the show The Practice cast from the 90s are on Greys.  Arizona appeared on THE PRACTICE as a Harvard lawyer.  Chief webber appeared on THE PRACTICE as an assistant district attorney.  Ellis Gray appeared on the THE PRACTICE as a prosecutor.

Note 3:  y are none of the interns fully black?  Black people appear as patients but the only black interns appear mixed.  It seems that Rhimes is always afraid her shows will be labelled black shows, so tho she places black people as the leads she limits how many other black people can be on the show.  I love dr. Bailey but find it odd that as the on,y lead black doctor she is very short and overweight while the white doctors are tall and very very very skinny.

Update: I watched the last half of the season and I am back addicted to the show.  I finally saw the singing episode that everyone was complaining about in the reviews.  Essentially, Calle was in a car accident and to explain her storyline, Callie, Owen, and Dr. Bailey sang the entire episode.  The Callie actress can sing really well and it would seem that the show was done this way to highlight her singing talent.  The people who messed up the episode were the SINGING DR. Bailey and the singing Owen.  Owen is an ugly singer.

Anyway, in the last half of the season: Callie and Arizona marry and have a baby, Meridith and Derrick have a baby, Mark gives Lexie to Avery, Keperson dates the Chief of Pediatric surgery, Adele develops alzheimers, Krev brings over some children from Africa, Lucy (Krev's girlfriend) gets offerred a job in Africa and Texas, etc..

What I found odd about this season is the lack of a season finale.  The last episode was one where decisions were disclosed but nothing juicy really happened: Teddy decided she loved her husband, Bailey decided to loved the nurse, Yang decided she didn't love Owen enough to have his baby, Owen decided he wanted a baby no matter what, Krev decided that he should commit to love, Meredith decided to stand up to her husband, Derrick decided he may not want to be with an amoral Meredith and so on...

I am upset there was no finale, but here I am feeling like I have to get Season EIGHT!",1431129600,,3497,4.533546325878595

I would strongly request that Amazon put it back on Prime.  Please get back the rights from ABC.  I am going into withdrawal.  Thank you.",1389398400,,415,4.324675324675325

4176099,4,B003R0MEW2,"I love Greys Anatomy and this season is no exception. However, the writers are beginning to stretch things the way soap opera writers do. Christina and Owen never seem to resolve. They just agonize and agonize and it begins to become tedious. The Chief's wife's Alzheimers becomes grotesque and it gets rubbed in his and our faces. Kepner's hysteria becomes infuriating - you just want to kick her in the teeth. And, Lexy is set up for a terrible death, and even though she's almost as annoying as Kepner, you just somehow feel she's being subjected to prolonged sadism. However, many episodes are medically brilliant and they alone make the season worth watching. Also, Alex Karev gets some redemption, which is a a relief.

4176231,4,B003R0MEW2,"Everybody is entitled to their opinion, however ""worse episode ever"" is over the top. Yeah some of the singing is ridiculous, but it shows quite well that Callie is hallucinating after a serious head injury.  I could have done without Meredith's singing because it's so out of character for her, and personally I think it would have been better if only Callie, Lexie, Owen, and Bailey sang.  Obviously the show was trying to showcase Sara Ramirez's singing after her first album came out,and I don't fault them for that.

The story beneath the songs is very powerful, so even if you don't like the singing, look beneath it a little bit, and you'll see what I mean.

This episode made me think about Chicago Hope's musical episode, which was hilarious!!!  Maybe if Grey's made this one a little funnier, it would be been well received.  But give it a chance.  It's still very good.

Truthfully, Callie should have been taken to another hospital because everyone at Seattle Grace is her friend.",1342828800,,992,4.760233918128655

Grey's fans do not watch the show for singing and this episode had so much potential and fell completely flat. It was so hard to watch. I really wanted to skip it all together but then I didn't want to miss anything important so I stuck with it even though it was awful. I really hope they never make an episode like this again. If I wanted to watch a musical, I would watch Glee; and if the writers wanted to make a musical, they should work for Glee. Gross!",1339804800,3,627,4.277310924369748

4176240,5,B003R0MEW2,"Ok, first off let me say that for the past 7 years I was totally not a fan of Grey's Anatomy, not at all. Seriously, I hated the show with a passion, because I found it to be boring, a House knockoff and it wasn't even funny enough to consider watching.  All this changed when I met my fiance 8 months ago, she is a fan of Grey's Anatomy, not enough to watch it full time like other people but enough that she managed to convince me to sit down with her and watch an episode (although this might have to do with the fact that we were handcuffed together at the time). So anyways.....I saw the episode where Callie told Arizona that she was pregnant. Seeing those two characters and all of their interactions in that one episode convinced me enough that I had to give this show a chance so I went back to work at my small remote location and looked up the list of Seasons of shows that we had, and alas found two seasons of Grey's Anatomy Season 1 and Season 7. I tried watching one episode of Season 1 and wanted to bang my head against the wall. So then I moved onto Season 7 which held my beloved couple and at first I will admit that I just fast forwarded everybody else's scenes and focused mainly on Calllie and Arizona, but then I came down in a bad cold and was quarrantined to my room and bored I started watching all of the episodes in its entirety and I was blown away on how good this season was and how not every character was lame or sucked. So now I am a Grey's Anatomy fan, I have ordered Seasons 5 and 6 (mainly because of the introduction of Arizona and the beggining parts of their relationship) Although now that Callie is one of my favorites and I got to really get to know her and enjoy her in the two episodes that Arizona was gone and I'm considering gettting Seasons 2,3 and 4 just because of her being in it. Anyways for anyone watching Grey's Anatomy or watched it and got tired of it and want a refresher watch Season 7 cause well......the season is just that good.",1336003200,,1992,4.174025974025974

For the most part, the series looks good on DVD, nice good closeups and skintones are natural and during low light scenes, I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the seventh season does look very good on DVD.

AUDIO:

As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. I did notice more surround usage in the final two episodes. From the sirens, gun shots, crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.

The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the success of how the sixth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"" literally ending with a bang, it made you wonder how Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers and the writers for the series would continue the excitement.

For the most part, the changes made in the sixth season was important.  The addition of newer characters, removal of one and building upon the momentum left from season six and sure enough, the writers had enough to work with.  From the post-traumatic stress that Cristina had suffered and the life changing decisions made by other characters.  That was important to showcase.

Also, I liked how each character had character building storylines and no one was left out.  Even Callie and Arizona as well as Mark and their triangle begins to become focused on. Especially with the musical and seeing how their relationship is tested.

But possibly the plus for this season are not about the lovemaking, not about the relationships, it's about the flaws of the characters.  Without getting into details, these situations are going to be quite interesting as it will carry on over to season eight.  Cristina having post-traumatic stress but also dealing with a situation that will definitely have a major affect on her and her relationship with Owen.  But also Meredith, who did something that is not so surprising, since she does have a good heart but unfortunately, she violated the trust of her husband and chief and unfortunately made an unethical decision as a doctor which unfortunately will hurt her career.

Suffice to say, the last season was shocking and emotional, but this time around, it's an emotional season in a different sense, marked by decisions made by each individual and unfortunately will lead to consequences that will factor into the eighth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"".

As for this DVD set, there are a good amount of special features including the web episodes of ""Seattle Grace: On Call"", deleted scenes and the making of the musical episode.

With that being said, while the sixth season was a tremendous season with a shocking finale, the seventh season was more of a recovering episode from what took place in season six and the talent did a fantastic job in showing their way of recovering from what took place.  The return of Mandy Moore as Mary Portman was touching but also an unexpected conclusion to her storyline and the various storylines that were setup that will have repercussions, we're going to have to wait and see how these characters are affected in season eight.

But the situations are realistic and without spoiling the series, fans of the series who didn't have a chance to watch the seventh season should be content.  These are well-written episodes, the acting was well-done and while people may feel a bit 50/50 on the inclusion of the musical, it does come to show that Shonda Rhimes is willing to take chances.

If you are a fan of the series, ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Seventh Season: More Heartbeats"" is definitely recommended!",1335571200,,10633,4.8764673001676915

4176251,5,B003R0MEW2,"We were vacationing in Mexico and I went on-line and purchased Grey's Anatomy Season 6 and 7 as well as Season 8 when it is ready for delivery.  Within a few days of my order and charges for the first of the two deliverable seasons were charged to my credit card - Master Card shut down my card because a charge of $ 370.72 was placed by [...] eusor1 on Feb 3/2012.  Can you imagine my frustration of being in a foreign country and no credit card.  I had always felt safe with giving my credit card information on the internet to such organizations as Amazon - but I am very skeptical now.  What could have happened?

There is no way to get a new credit card until my return to Canada and at the time - my husband also had his card cut off because I am the major card holder.  I was able - after lengthy discusions - to get his card back up and operational - but I cannot have a card in my name until I return to Canada.

I would be very interested in hearing from you as to the reason behind this ambiguous charge.",1330214400,,1015,4.045
4176252,5,B003R0MEW2,"Season 1:
The beginning of Dr. McDreamy, its about time Patrick Dempsey was on  series, addictive start.

Season 2:
The wife arrives from NY adds serious issues and Dr. McSteamy, Love Eric Dane is also here to stay.

Season 3:
The dating for Meredith beings with Dr. McDreamy + Dr. McVet, Great seeing Chris O'Donnell here.

Season 4: The elevator scene with Derek, Meredith, Addison, Rose & Mark my favorite moment along with the candle ending scene.

Season 5:
The addition of Army Trama Surgeon Dr. Hunt, Kevin Mckidd is also another favorite.

Season 6:
The changes, the new characters, the merge between SG + MW I was not a big fan of, yet by the end, everything came full circle.
But I did love seeing Kim Raver after 24, it took time to adjust from her 24 character, Audrey to Dr. Altman without Jack Bauer to save her ;)
I was happy with the Derek/Meredith ""post-it"" commitment,
very happy Meredith overcame her ""issues"" and their relationship was definitely at the next level.

Season 7:

This season is my favorite because all the characters seemed like:
1 big close family,
a team of doctors that care about each and about each others relationship,
still competitive but seemed like less running around going behind each others back,
less ""on-call room"" and less ""taking off scrubs"".

Instead, more humor, more care, stronger friendships, stronger team.

Of course, I missed the characters Addison, Izzy & George even Denny but I enjoyed every episode with all the characters and all the storylines.

I like the fact that:
Cristina went fishing with Derek (im glad they had their conversations on the boat & roof top)
Cristina & Owen live in a firehouse
Dr. Kepner got over her Dr. McDreamy crush,
Dr. Bailey was less upset,
Dr. McSteamy was more involved with wanting to be a father than being with more women,
Grey Sisters really had a sister relationship,
Dr. Altman had a Henry & Andrew.

Season 7 was a balance of tears and laughter for me.",1330128000,3,1956,4.703812316715543

My girlfriend loves this season, she cannot stop watching it. She was going to watch it over Christmas break from college, but looks like she is going to complete the season way before that. Of course I bet she will watch it all over again.",1322870400,,404,4.534246575342466
4176283,1,B003R0MEW2,"I own all earlier seasons of this and they were very good.  I wish I had not purchased this season and am putting it up for sale.  There must be entirely new writers and directors for this season, and they definitely have a social agenda.  There is more attempting to focus on and 'normalize' deviant behavior than on good medical drama.  I'm far from a prude, but this has become disgusting.  Don't waste your money on this season",1322784000,,431,4.4743589743589745
4176284,5,B003R0MEW2,"I'm a hardcore Grey's fan, and though I have loved every season, I know that some people fell off and started to get critical after the whole Izzie-sees-ghosts thing and after George died. And even though I loved those two characters, I honestly don't think the show has ever been better than it was in seasons 6 and 7. They are the best seasons of this show without question. If you are someone who has become hesitant or tired of watching Grey's, this is the season for you. If you are an intensely devoted fan like me, you cannot be without this season.",1322006400,,556,4.407766990291262

4176286,5,B003R0MEW2,"I loved this season.

When Callie started singing, I was worried they had just jumped the shark but once I got over the surprise, this episode became one of my favorites.  Never thought I'd see singing on this show and like it but it worked for me.

I also liked the documentary episode.  And yes, I ""got"" the nod (music & visual) to M*A*S*H.  Thanks to MASH I believe those medical dramas that aired after MASH had more heart to their stories because of MASH's success & formula.

But unlike MASH, which treated Asians as nothing more than two-dimensional chracters, I loved how Christina was flushed out so we could see her in all her three demensions.

Men in Trees was one of my favorite shows so it was good to see James Tupper looking hot as ever in the role of Dr Altman's lover & the hospital's temp. shrink.

I ALMOST did not watch this season but am glad I did.  Now I can't wait for Season 8 to be avail on DVD!  I might actually break down and watch the Instant video since the first few episodes of Season#8 are already available.",1321833600,2,1043,4.329896907216495

4176288,5,B003R0MEW2,"I was so blown away by this season after the shooting finale of last season.  I know they took a lot of flack for the musical episode but it is one of my all time favorites.  It showcased these many talented actors who proved themseves to be such amazing singers.  I loved this show and it took guts to break ground like that and do something so out of the box.  As for the season, there is no sugar coated jumpiing back in the saddle for these doctors.  It allows you to see them going through the serious symptoms of PTSD.  I enjoyed every moment of this dvd.  The extras are so terrific too, especially the behind the scenes for the musical and the out takes bloopers.  Very funny.",1321315200,8,684,4.248062015503876

4176312,5,B003R0MEW2,"If you like the series as much as I do, which is a lot, this is one of those classic epic episodes that continues to push the envelope.  While remaining true to Grey's form, it's full of drama, and the shocking ending will simply implore you to go right into the next episode, ""Song Beneath the Song"", which is also known as the ""musical event"".  I was skeptical about how well that episode would turn out, but again, the writers and actors both do a fantastic job at making you cry along with the whole cast.  Excellent work Grey's, you've gotten me hooked again and again!",1319673600,,574,4.39622641509434

4176330,5,B003R0MEW2,"Well they did it again! With great story lines and an awesome ensemble my interest has been captured again. The dvds feature some bonus content including a blooper reel which is always good for a laugh but back to that in a moment. The best would have to be of the musical episode """"Song Beneath the Song"" It features deleted scenes, a behind the episode featurette which shows the original concept, how they pitched it, a great table read, and how they filmed it. It made me enjoy the episode more than I did the first time through.

Now back to those dvd extras. The blooper reel of course, unaired scenes and the web episodes ""Seattle Grace a Message of Hope"" directed by Kevin McKidd. The reason why this is the best isn't the subtle humor. But in fact Kevin McKidd let's out his accent...yay!!!

4176335,5,B003R0MEW2,"Coming into this season after the way they ended season 6 was going to be a challenge, but I think it was handled beautifully.  Spoilers ahead:  I know many people criticized Christina's story line at the beginning of the season, but it was my favorite.  I went through a tragedy once myself, and seeing her pull away, change who she was, and then finally come back with a vengeance was like watching what I went through.  I loved that she really went through the grief rather than wrapping it up in two episodes, it was more realistic to me.  I will say there is one episode I absolutely hated, the documentary one I definitely could have done without, but don't let that one episode be the reason you don't get this set (you may like it), because the rest of the season is in true Grey's form.  I also loved the journey of Alex this season, he and Christina were both center stage and it was a nice change of pace. Callie, Mark, and Arizona's journey as a ""family"" was also a good storyline.  Adele's Alzheimer's was heartbreaking, and if I had been Meredith I would have done the same thing.

My top five episodes for the season:

1.  ""The Song Beneath the Song""-- From what I read you either loved or hated this episode. I loved it, I think I cried through most of it.  Sara Ramirez really knocks this episode out of the park.  The last song ""The Story"" was so amazingly done, you can almost feel her trying to get back into her body.  Chasing Cars with Sara Ramirez, Kevin McKidd, and Chandra Wilson was easliy the best track for me.  The emotion in this episode was portrayed so perfectly I don't think I moved or blinked the entire time.  If you are a true Grey's fan and you like the music you will love this episode.

2.  ""Adrift and at Peace""-- Derek taking Christina fishing was exactly what she needed; her emotional break down was one of the beast moments of the season.  Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh should share more scenes together.  Meredith yelling at Owen was also priceless.

3.  ""Disarm""-- A mass shooting brings back memories for the staff, and Christina gets her groove back.  Watching her realize her real passion was always surgery was a beautiful moment.  Sandra Oh really gave a wonderful performance, The scene with everyone crying in the gallery, and then bursting into hysterical laughter was the best scene of the episode.

4.  ""Almost Grown""-- I loved seeing the interns get thrown in as doctors in this episode.  You can really tell how much they've changed and grown up over the years, and how some things never change.  The presentations for the million dollar grant were funny and Derek's was very emotional.

5.  ""Golden Hour""-- It was nice to get a Meredith centric episode here, she is still my favorite character. Mer really gets to shine here, and I loved the real-time vibe of this episode.  Bailey and Eli have some fun, and run into trouble of their own.  Alex's sensitive side comes out, and then you remember why you like him so much.  Adele showing up in the ER, and then realizing that she is sick was a great setup for storylines to come later in the season.

Other notable episodes are ""Unaccompanied Minor"" and ""White Wedding""

For anyone who thinks Grey's has jumped the shark or is just getting old, watch Seasons 6 & 7 because they really bring back the magic. To sum it all up just like with any other season of Grey's you will laugh, cry, and fall in love all over again with this show and the characters.  I can't wait for season 8!",1315440000,29,3490,4.485714285714286
4176336,5,B003R0MEW2,"So yea, ok I admit it was strange at first to watch an episode full of musical numbers.  But, once I got over myself this episode became one of the most powerful of the whole season.  The music was perfectly matched to the story and it added another layer of emotion. Maybe I feel this way because music is such a big part of my life, but I LOVED what the music made this episode.  That being said, I'm not too sure how I would feel if they did this all the time.",1315094400,8,463,3.956989247311828
4176337,5,B003R0MEW2,"I thought this episode was one of the best of the season, and actually got me back to the series after some of the lackluster episodes of previous seasons.

8403083,3,B003R0MEW2,"There's nothing wrong with the show itself, but the way it was packaged is the worst I've seen. First of all, after paying for the DVD, we are bombarded on Disk 1 with a number of ads for other shows. The worst ""feature,"" however, is the extraordinarily poor subtitle management. I'm somewhat hard of hearing and rely on subtitles to save me the effort of trying to figure out what happened in a soft-spoken conversation. For some unfathomable reason, the producers decided it'd be fun to put French as the first choice, Spanish as the second, and then a number of Asian languages which are shown as ""English."" The REAL English subtitles are ""#5 English."" I think #3 is Chinese characters and #4 is perhaps Thai. Perhaps the producers regard this as a hilarious way to have fun with the people who buy the DVD.",1527811200,,810,4.593103448275862
