1481861,1,B00005JLR1,"Robert Lewis Stevenson would be turning over in his grave if he knew what they did to his beloved story classic. It's really that bad.
Why would they take a time honored literary classic and make it into a hokey sci-fi cartoon? Why? Because that's what Disney does. Disney has done some splendid work on classic tales in the past but on this one, they bombed.
It's just downright awful. There's no soul to this story...
Move along, there's nothing to see here.",1051142400,12,460,4.554216867469879
1481862,5,B00005JLR1,"Walt Disney was fascinated with the story of Treasure Planet and had actually opted to do it as the first full length animated film. He then realized it didn't need to be animated and did Snow White. He kept thinking about a way to do Treasure Island as an animated movie and eventually made it as the studios first live action film. Now, the Disney team has come up with a brilliant way to do it as an animated film. They set it in space and it is my favorite film version of Treasure Island. I know it did horribly at the theaters, but so did Cinderella and look at how well known that is. You will love Treasure Planet if you liked the book or the live action version. The best part would have to be B.E.N, a crazy robot on Treasure Planet who is clearly missing a few pieces and is voiced by Martin Short. Plus the ending was so cool and original! Definately not the typical cute musicle Disney is known for doing in the past.",1043280000,12,930,4.201117318435754

He thought they would might appreciate the ""space"" version of this classic tale.  Even when though you think you know this classic, I have to say that the version really is compelling and you will find yourself watching it more than once.  At least... that's our experience. It is a cartoon - however, don't let that keep you from trying it.  You can rent it for just a few dollars and see what you think.  We purchased the movie and  I like that we own it and can stream any time the boys want to watch it.",1518393600,2,664,4.264

1482383,5,B00005JLR1,"Honestly I believe this is one of the most underrated movies; most of my friends and family either don't like this movie or think it's forgettable. Now this is not something I should mention in a 5 Star review as it weakens my argument but I wanted to pull a ""Good Guy Grant"" and let you know where I'm coming from.

This movie has a very likable protagonist, some good music that fits the mood well, and has a very good plot which even makes you really like the bad guy. I bought the original ""Treasure Island"" book thinking that this movie was basically a futuristic version of that, but was very much surprised that the book didn't hold up to the movie (in my opinion) and had more significant differences.

Don't go into this movie thinking it's Pulp Fiction level of amazing; it is a Great movie, but not going to win filmmakers awards or blow your mind. If you enjoy a fun, family adventure movie that will get you some feels and which has some amazing characters then pick this up. I need to watch it again and give an update to this review sometime.

4.5/5 stars, rounded up for me ;P",1511740800,,1092,4.3431372549019605

1482386,5,B00005JLR1,"This is the best loosely adapted Treasure Island you'll ever see (okay, maybe a tie with Muppet Treasure Island).  It's certainly one of my favorite Disney animated movies.  Disney does a good job of turning a murderous scalawag into a compassionate father figure (they seem to have a thing with making villains into lovable characters).  My least favorite character is B.E.N., but Doppler and Captain Amelia more than make up for him.  I especially love the music.",1510358400,,465,5.0

1482542,5,B00005JLR1,"Disney movies can certainly be enjoyed by all but there are certain movies that have more obvious appeals to boys and girls. Girls usually win out when it comes to Disney animated movies what with so many heroines and princesses being placarded upon the silver screen. But Disneys Treasure Planet, a science fiction reimagining of the famous Treasure Island tale by Robert Louis Stevenson, is firmly a boys adventure tale and what an adventure it is!

Jim Hawkins is your average teenager being raised by a hard working single mother at an inn. He helps mom out and sees how tired she is; he wants to deliver the wealth of the stars to her, and he wants to sail the vast oceans of space. In the meantime, without the ability to get off of his space rock, he gets in trouble frequently with the local law but thats patty cake compared to the trouble he ends up getting in when a mysterious stranger entrusts him with a treasure map being sought after by space pirates who end up destroying the inn. And so he ends up off on an adventure with a plucky lot of miscreants and wayfarers, some noble of heart and others scallywags that would flip a piece on Jack Sparrow. Hawkins strikes up several relationships with various shipmates but none are more important than the one he makes with John Silver, a cyborg cat-like creature whose metal arm is a wonder of whizzing gears and circuits and an arsenal of knives and cookery utensils. (The animation for this movie, the sharpness of it especially in light of how quick the action is and how detailed some of the characters like John Silver are is simply fantastic.) Silver stands in for a father figure for Jim and though Silver is a determined pirate his heart bleeds and has a true affinity for the little lad. Silvers relationship with Jim is both heartwarming, heart wrenching, and fraught with real tension. Silver is a bad guy, very much so, but you want so badly to root for him especially because of the meaning he ends up imbuing into Jims sad story.

And while thats certainly enough to make a compelling movie theres so much more to this Treasure Island treatment. We watch Jim grow up on screen as he bumps along and takes his painful stand against someone whom he comes to love. He is aided by a crazy cuckoo robot, a floating piece of pink goo that can change shapes and has quite the sense of humor (best pet ever?), a doopy professor patron from the inn, and the ships rightful captain and first mate. The story moves along briskly and, dare I say it as it takes place in outer space with a lot of splendiferous space ships that look like old 1600 buccaneer vessels? The movie soars. Great stuff, and its one that though it can be enjoyed by the girls, its really for the boys.",1502582400,,2739,4.486973947895792

Overall, the film is beautifully done, the characters, well designed especially James Hawkins who is coming of age throughout the film.  The animation is beautifully done especially for its time and the combination of 3D and 2D aspects makes city and space scenes that much more jaw breaking.  Nice combination of heartfelt moments, comedy, action, and adventure that could please anyone.  Highly recommend this underrated Disney film.",1501286400,2,489,5.394736842105263

I will say as a point of caution that if you lead more towards the realistic side of sci-fi (i.e. needing to understand how the devices are supposed to work) then this might not be for you. There are pirate ships in space for no reason besides pirate ships in space are awesome, and if that's too much to ask you to swallow then better to skip this one.",1473984000,5,651,4.336065573770492

Andrews Blu-ray Review: When watching the Walt Disney animated film TREASURE PLANET today, its hard to believe the animated cartoon has just reached its 15th anniversary and not because it feels new, but rather quite the opposite. While THREASURE PLANET is enjoyable to watch, it plays like a product of the 1990s. With dated computer graphics, artistic style, and soundtrack, the films release to Blu-ray entertains but reminds audiences why it never became another Walt Disney classic, but despite this, I really enjoyed its adventurous attitude.

TREASURE PLANET is based loosely on Robert Louis Stevensons novel Treasure Island, and spun into a sci-fi world of the future with space pirates, aliens, laser guns, and automatons. With legendary Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements at the helm, this film appeared to be a way for them to take animation beyond the worlds of ALADDIN and THE LITTLE MERMAID, and be appealing more to a male audience.

But while the adventure of the film is often exciting, there is little character connection. Though the motivations behind most of the characters actions is simple seeking a long-lost treasure and only a handful have enough development for audiences to care about them. But the animated film often makes up for its relatively simple story with a unique visual style, a seamless blend of traditional hand-drawn and computer-generated animation, even if the CGI appears to be of an era further back than its fifteen year age appearance.

Also slightly dating the animated films tremendous song Im Still Here, supplied by John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls. Hearing the singing voices instantly took me back to the 1990s as it was prominently featured in the middle of the animated film. This one song is a far cry from the brilliant musical numbers featured in so many of Walt Disneys animated films.

It has been fifteen years since I had last seen the animated cartoon TREASURE PLANET, when it first arrived in the cinema. Before watching the new Blu-ray home release last night, all I really remembered about the animated film was something about an obnoxious robot ruining its third act. And sure enough, an over-the-top hyperactive robot voiced by Martin Short entered the picture right on cue, far too late for a new character to be introduced, especially one that ultimately proved to be fairly useless to the story.

But this time around, I looked past that unnecessary character to the grander picture of the animated film, able to enjoy it not as an instant classic, but instead this is a fun adventure through outer space and I don't even want to admit to a direct reference to the unfortunate and totally obnoxious film Pirates of the Caribbean. It may not be perfect, far from John Musker and Ron Clements best work, and perhaps not worthy of its 2002 Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film, but it is at least enjoyable romp around the cosmic universe.

With reaching its 15th anniversary milestone, TREASURE PLANET, has been given some sprucing up for this Blu-ray UK release. The animated film itself looks terrific and sounds even better, but sadly no new bonus features are added for this release, including, taking viewers behind-the-scenes into the making of each element of the movie. But sadly they are all presented in standard definition and are recycled from previous inferior DVD releases. But Walt Disney fans shouldnt immediately shrug off TREASURE PLANET, especially as it was directed by two of Walt Disneys best and while it may not hold up to the standards set by so many other timeless Walt Disney musicals, its an adventure that is well worth viewing, and best viewed on this new Blu-ray UK release.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studios presents this Blu-ray in a totally awesome 1080p encoded image presentation. The 1.66:1 aspect ratio HD image looks downright amazing.  There was the slightest bit of banding in the opening shot, but aside from that and a couple of other instances here and there, its an astonishing transfer.  Colors are bright and bold, detail is exquisite and the entire film seems to have nearly presented us with a 3D effect, but sadly not being shown in 3D.  Weve all become so used to the computer animated films looking so good that when you go back and watch a 2D film, its nice to have it look nearly as good.  For those that have never seen TREASURE PLANET and it looks totally amazing.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios presents this Blu-ray in an amazing new 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix, more than does the job. Every sound seems to resonate with the utmost clarity.  Dialogue is, of course, crisp and clean and even the pirate speak sounds great. The brilliant surround sounds are heard often, adding some terrific atmosphere to an already very active soundtrack. Like the video presentation, this audio mix is second to none and will give your speakers a good workout.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Disney's Animation Magic: Treasure Planet [2003] [480i] [14:16] Walt Disney Feature Animation chairman Roy Disney goes behind-the-scenes of Treasure Planet to investigate the designs of the characters and creatures, the creation of Marquettes, the use of storyboard, story reels and layouts, and the process the animators used to combine CGI and hand-drawn animation into a workable product. We also get contributions from Glen Keane [Supervising Animator, John Silver]; Kent Melton [Character Sculptures]; John Musker [Director] and Ron Clements [Director]. Directed by Jeff Kurtti. Writing Credits by Jeff Kurtti. Produced by Bernadette Bowman, Barbara Gerald, Jeff Kurtti, Scott Musgrove and Michael Pellerin.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:32] Here we have three unfinished deleted scenes which includes: Introducing by Laurie Metcalf; ""Original Prologue: Adult Jim;"" ""Original Sequence Two: Jim Meets Ethan"" and ""Alternate Ending: Rebuilding the Benbow."" We also have at one point introductions by directors John Musker and Ron Clements. As usual you can either watch them individually or Play All.

Special Feature: Im Still Here (Jims Theme) Music Video Performed by John Rzeznik of The Goo Goo Dolls [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:12] John Rzeznik was picked to write the song for the animated film, because it was believed he could relate well with Treasure Planet' main character, Jim, and his ""rebel-with-a-cause angst."" Referring to Jim, John Rzeznik said, ""It was easy to relate to Jim, you know? I felt a lot like that when I was his age."" It was a moderately successful pop hit.

Preview Trailers: Sleeping Beauty  Diamond Edition [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.20:1] [1:07]. FROZEN [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:25]. Disney XD [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:30]. Wheres My Water [Download] [1080p] [1.85:1] [00:31]

Finally, with this 15th anniversary milestone of this 2015 remastered Blu-ray release of TREASURE PLANET has been given little more than a sprucing up for this UK Blu-ray release. The film itself looks and sounds brilliant, but sadly no new bonus features are added for this UK Blu-ray release. But sadly there is nothing to shout home about, except taking viewers behind-the-scenes into the making of each element of the animated film. Disney fans shouldnt immediately shrug off TREASURE PLANET, because it was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, which is by two of Walt Disneys best and while it may not hold up to the standards set by so many timeless musicals, its an adventure that is well worth seeing, and best viewed on this new 2015 Blu-ray UK release. But sadly there is no upgrade on the extras and they are only presented in standard definition and are of course have been recycled from previous inferior DVD release, but despite this, I am so pleased to add this to my ever increasing Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

1483774,5,B00005JLR1,"Treasure Planet is a highly underrated Disney film - so much so that I had never even heard of it during my childhood. When it popped up on Netflix a few months ago, I gave it a chance and absolutely fell in love with the film. As soon as the film was removed from Netflix, I was devastated, and knew I had to purchase a copy for myself.

Unlike many other Disney films which focus solely on romance, Treasure Planet is a touching, exciting, and hilarious coming-of-age film with a great ensemble cast of characters and voice talent. If you've never seen it before, I can promise that you will not be disappointed in buying it to watch for the first time. If you have seen it before, then what are you waiting for? Add it to your collection so you can watch it again and again!

Shipping was fast, the product was packaged safely, and I don't regret any one cent spent on this film. I am incredibly satisfied and would recommend this film and this seller to anyone. Go ahead and buy this already, and enjoy!",1454457600,,1007,4.351063829787234

1483890,5,B00005JLR1,One of our favorite twists on a classic.,1451088000,,40,4.125
1483891,4,B00005JLR1,"For as much as I've been a fan of Disney's movies, there's admittedly a couple of their films that came out while I was growing up, that, for whatever reason, I never saw; this being one of them. Perhaps part of the reason is that this movie is infamous for being Disney's biggest failure--being a huge bomb at the box office. And it seems most people blame bad marketing, because anyone I've talked to about the movie sings praises about it. So when I happened upon a copy of the movie, I decided to finally give it a watch and see just what all the fuss was about, and why it's gained a cult following of sorts.

The verdict? It's certainly weird and different, but also very creative in its meshing of old world designs with a science fiction future.

Based on the classic book, ""Treasure Island"", the story is about a teenager named Jim Hawkins, who seeks adventure and purpose in his life after his father mysteriously left him. One day, a spaceship crash lands near his mother's inn, and before dying, the pilot gives Jim a map to the legendary 'Treasure Planet'--a world said to contain the riches of over a thousand planets. With his family friend, Dr. Doppler, to help him, Jim commissions a ship to set sail and find the treasure. Among the crew is the  cat-like, sharp-witted Captain Amelia, and the tough-but-friendly cyborg cook, Long John Silver. But not everyone is as they appear, and as the crew draws closer to the fabled planet, enemies reveal themselves, and alliances are forged as it becomes a race to see who can find the treasure first...and in time, a few characters will learn that there's some things in life more important than gold and riches.

Let me start by saying that I've never read the book, ""Treasure Island"", so I can't really comment on how faithful this film was to the novel, in terms of characterization, that is (though, I have no doubt they took alot of creative liberties). But going in blind, all of these characters are very likeable and diverse. Captain Amelia is especially memorable for showing class and respect, while not being overly strict, and B.E.N.--a robot who joins the party later on, is funny for his scatterbrained-ness, without being super annoying. Jim and Silver get the most characterization, however. Jim is especially relatable in his struggle to try and do the right thing and make his mother proud. And his growing father/son-ish friendship with Silver causes the old pirate to grow a heart and rethink what's most important to him in life.

The most stunning thing about this movie, however, is the visuals and the universe its set in. It would've been easy to just set the story in the pirate days and just tell ""treasure island"" straightforward. And consequently, it would've also been fine to go completely sci-fi and set everything on gleaming, metal spaceships. But this film goes the extra mile and decides to combine the two together; creating an intriguing alternate future where people still wear clothes from the turn of the century, but with planets populated by all sorts of (creatively designed) aliens that fly pirate ships through space (with the aid of futuristic technology). How alot of this tech works is never explained, but in this instance, it doesn't really need to be; your imagination can fill in the blanks (like how any of the characters breathe in outer space without suits for example). All of this is well complimented by how the film combines the use of traditional and computer animation--traditional for the characters, and CGI for the ships and technology. This was still at a time when Disney was trying to incorporate more computer effects into their films, and while there's some instances where the 2-D and 3-D don't mesh too well, it's not enough to take me out of the movie or knock it down a star.

After so many people recommending this to me, I'm glad I finally watched it. Putting a sci-fi twist on an old classic was a creative idea, and it's a shame that the movie didn't do well on release. Hopefully, it's life on DVD will give it the attention it deserves. Anyone who's a fan of the ""steampunk"" genre will DEFINATELY like this.",1449878400,,4147,4.720994475138122

1484377,4,B00005JLR1,"Arthur C Clarke's famous quote, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"" finds a good home in this tale of a young man finding his call in life within a culture that has kept all the trappings of open ocean sailing ship travel intact even for interstellar voyages. The magic of the tech here is how it is truly a facilitator for a chosen life, a style of culture, where star travel is routine and accomplished aboard full-sail galleons and frigates that maintain breathable atmosphere on deck (complete with fresh breezes) and artificial gravity, while captains, first mates, and crewmembers deal with the reefs and shoals of black holes and admire the nebulae drifting by. The orbital town/spaceport built to look like a large permanently-crescent moon (from a distance) is an especially cool touch. The world created here depicts beings of all kinds making the technology fit their vision of life, not being dragged along behind it. Disney's experiences with scifi have been hit and miss, down through the years. ""The Black Hole"" was dismal, but ""Tron"" was so groundbreaking that it inspired a hundred careers in CGI for movies.  I don't seek out Disney for Disney's sake, but Treasure Planet is an amazing departure from stock Disney design, and is a touching story that seems to modify Clarke's insight to, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology blends seamlessly into any life you choose.""",1433808000,,1423,5.1072961373390555

1484472,5,B00005JLR1,"I was largely surprised. When I first went to see this movie back when it was in theaters, I didn't like it all that much. My cousins did, but I didn't. I was bored by it somehow. But I learned over time that that depended on my nine-year-old tastes and that tastes sometimes change. This movie finally grew on me last year. It came up on Netflix along with a whole slew of Disney movies I hadn't seen on there before and I went on a binge. I decided what the hey and watched it later on. I'm so glad I gave it another chance!

The animation, music scores and storytelling really make this one a gem. It does go a bit slow however and I think that that's what made me not like it as a child.

This is a story about a young man named Jim Hawkins, who lives with his mother at an inn and tavern that she runs on a planet very similar to Earth. He wants to feel the freedom of thrills and adventure, but is stuck helping his mother with the inn quite often. One day, a strange, alien like creature appears ""shipwrecked"" at their back door (he was a pirate). He passes away, leaving behind a map that leads to a legendary treasure. Jim takes it to a family friend, a sentient- actually genius- dog like character who has been researcher for years and shows it to him (although before this, he didn't know it was the map really). He convinces him to help him get his mother to let him take a voyage to look for the lost treasure. A captain, crew and ship are assigned for the task. The captain seems very strict yet kind (she's a creature based on felines) and the crew looks mean (most of them are various aliens, some looking like insects, others dripped slime, some having hooks for hands, some having eight legs, etc) ... Jim is added on board as an assistant to the ship's galley cook, a sort of rough looking cyborg. At this point, the adventure looks like it just couldn't get any worse to Jim...

The story really has it's emotional ups and downs and quite a few great laughs as well. There is also a romance that goes on in the ""sidelines"" of the story that I find highly adorable. ;)

Also a great Fathers Day kind of movie. Jim grows up without a father since his father leaves and never comes back, but the relationship he establishes with a father figure in this movie is one of the most touching relationships in any Disney movie... Probably second only to that of one of the following:

Bambi and his mother

Dumbo and his mother

Lilo and Nani from Lilo & Stitch

Brother Bear's Kenai and Koda

(None of them are father-son, but they are good comparison for the level of strength of the relationship)

1484709,4,B00005JLR1,"Treasure Island as a sci-fi cartoon, what an unexpected approach.  It cost $140 million to create and came away with a whopping $38 million from theaters in Canada and the US.  It was also nominated for best animated feature but lost to a much better film, Spirited Away.  There was supposed to be a sequel and a TV series but being such a huge disappointment at the box office, both were scrapped.

Personally, I found the artwork snazzy, the concept a bit loony but fun, the characters all enjoyable; I don't see why more people didn't flock to the theater to see it (me being one of them.  I waited to buy it on DVD instead).

Treasure Planet is notable for being Patrick McGoohan's last film (the voice for Billy Bones).",1416441600,,724,4.488549618320611

1484773,5,B00005JLR1,"A near-forgotten Disney film, this, in my opinion, this is one of the most amazing adaptations of a classic tale, ever!  Imaginative with a wonderful use of poetic license, while still staying true to the spirit of the original tale (""Treasure Island"" by Robert Louis Stevenson, in case anyone was wondering),while featuring one of the finest blending of traditional and computer-based animation...it is impactful, meaningful, and downright enjoyable.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Most Disney films don't have too much to worry about in the content realm...and this film is no exception.  I must note, though, that there is a stronger sense of violence (space pirates...kinda comes with the territory) and even two deaths - well to be exact, these specific characters fall(?) into the depths of space...so you don't see them ""killed"", but it is rather obvious that they died.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT SPOILERS):
This movie, as stated above, is based upon ""Treasure Island"" and it stays quite close to the core plot and spirit of the tale.  However, what amazes me is how they use that foundation to build such fantastic world that feels like a fresh blend of both sci-fi and fantasy.  The pacing is balanced well, and the characters leave lasting impressions.  The internal struggles are also relatable and there were many powerful moments which drove me to tears (both sadness and happiness).  It really is a solid film that the crew seemed to enjoy putting together.  What stood out to me most, though was how focused the tale was.  Yes, there were several tangents and ""side-plots"", but they always remembered their main story and used even the tangents to help augment the tale as a whole.  It really left me thinking and contemplating it.

CHARACTERS:
Though a lot of this movie shines, none of the other aspects can really exist if it weren't for the interesting cast of characters.  Not only are they memorable (even many of the minor ones), but the actors and actresses carry their parts really well.  It felt so natural and the cast chemistry was exceptionally good.

EXTRAS:
I liked all the extras.  They are really in-depth and give you good information about the source material, the technology used to produce the movie, and the inspirations they had for many of the concepts.  They also have a mini-documentary about the life of a pirate.  They put a lot of thought and production value into it.  Most extras in DVDs I usually like one or two things...if any.  This is one of the few times that all of it is worth it and really feels like you are getting more than your money's worth.

ALL IN ALL:
I love this film and have watched it several times...you know, I'll probably watch it even more times.  This is a wonderful tale about coming of age and redemption.  It is also a wonderful tale about finding purpose and direction in life...and discovering how strong your beliefs are, or what they are in the first place.  Definitely recommended.",1415404800,3,2947,4.836327345309381

1484845,5,B00005JLR1,"A truly grand movie.  If there is any movie that Disney needs to make an remake or second movie of, it would be this one.  This film really touched my heart, and had many characters that were brilliant!  When I watched the movie, all the characters seemed to be, for lack of a better description, whole and believable.  I loved how they made a female captain, Amelia, be in charge, and the way she way she portrayed and voice acted. I really did feel there was a friendship and an father-son bond forming between Jim and John.  I wish at the end of the movie they would have showed more on the whereabouts of both Jim's father and John's, because I think the ending would have been a lot better with at least a hint on where they were.

1484915,4,B00005JLR1,"Genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. More so since it happened by way of a babysitting session, meaning I didn't have a say in its selection.

Despite that trepidation, I found myself getting caught up in the story. And like every iteration of this classic tale - if there was a character who made the plot work - that would be sly Long John Silver, brought to life by way of captivating illustration and voiced to perfection by actor Brian Murray.

A seeming dastardly villain who had to claw, cut, and maim his way to the top of the pirate upper echelon. Embodying self-serving, mistrustful, and heartless like a tattoo - he's a thug who regularly rids himself of anyone not useful to his purpose.

Suddenly and unexpectedly, the pirate is thrust into a position of teaching a young man the path to manhood, Silver is stunned to discover untapped parental instincts - love - that wasn't completely lost or torn from his heart.

Following the original RLS story, the pair are on a wild adventurous journey to a secret treasure hidden on a mysterious ""island"" far from civilized society; holding wealth beyond measure and the promise of a lifetime of luxury, these two become uncommon friends.

But will Silver's band of mutinous cutthroats see this bonding the same way? They've signed on for treasure and blood - and not necessarily in that order.

Their leader seems distracted. The kind of distraction that gets a privateer dead.

As the pair gets closer to the treasure and one another - Silver has to choose where his heart truly resides.

A very agreeable animated film and one that can be watched with young children - if our 8-year old niece is any gauge.

My only complaint is that the colors seemed a bit flat; thought purer blacks would've punched up things a bit - especially for the deep space and treasure scenes. A minor demerit coming from an adult. <g>",1406764800,,1884,4.684848484848485

It had been 7 or 8 years since we had viewed the film on VHS.  1080p quality, surround sound, and Blu-ray enhancement have made this film more of a masterpiece of this lesser known classic.  The casting for this film is dead on with the voices matching characters perfectly.  The animation is cutting edge in its design and the color contrast of the film gives it a razor sharp visual experience.  The story, even with Disney's twist, is timeless, the characters are well developed, and the subtle twists of world history make the film enjoyable for the young and the young at heart.  The film pays homage to great literature and to science fiction of the 20th C  This film will age well if you add it to your collection as it is NOT one in which bizarre or surprise type ending would only allow you to enjoy it for only the first time.

1485187,5,B00005JLR1,"Disney Studios 43rd full length animated feature film Treasure Planet is an interesting entry in the Disney animated film cannon. It's closest in design to Atlantis The Lost Empire only in that is is another adventure driven film. The animation in this film is outstanding, but unlike Atlantis in this adventure we do get a song(which I found unnecessary), but it is more like a rock video than a musical number. This is a hybrid film combining hand drawn animation with CGI. It's kind of like Treasure Island meets Star Wars.

On to the product itself. The Blu Ray transfer looks fantastic and for once Disney has carried over all important bonus material from the previous edition making me give it 5 stars for not irritating me to no end.

It was shamefully lazy for a producer to have let this one slip out of the studio!  You can't relate to the characters they are so ugly.  Lucas or Dream Works should have produced this because the graphics are crudely done.  The writers of this could have also put more thought into the ending.  I am only giving this movie a 2 because the golden ship against the royal starry sky was pleasing in the beginning of the movie--the rest was disappointing knowing what is available to artists today.  Also, the ""hatch-face"" trend on characters is a giant turn off.  People want to be entertained, not repulsed!  This was a waste of money!",1393027200,,762,4.544117647058823

1485500,5,B00005JLR1,"Looking at this movie, I can sort of understand why it flopped in theaters.  It's not typical Disney fare, seeing as Disney hasn't dabbled much in science fiction with their animated films (""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""WALL-E"" are the only other examples I can think of).  It's also not as ""cute"" and child-friendly as other Disney films, it lacks memorable musical numbers, and as far as I know there have been no real breakout characters from it showing up in merchandise or the theme parks.  The fact that it debuted in theaters at the same time as several other popular franchise films (including Harry Potter, Star Wars, and the American release of ""Spirited Away"" by Disney itself) didn't exactly help matters, and it got practically lost in the shuffle.  Most people, even Disney fans, seem to dismiss it as a forgettable blip on the radar and one of the less impressive Disney films.

For those who have dismissed this film without giving it a look, I encourage you to take the time to watch it.  It's one of Disney's better modern-day offerings, and is both visually impressive and quite heartfelt.

Adapting Robert Louis Stevenson's classic ""Treasure Island"" with a futuristic twist, this film follows Jim Hawkins, the rebellious teenage son of an innkeeper who constantly finds himself at odds with the law and dreams of finding adventure and treasure among the stars.  When an artifact that turns out to be a starmap falls into his hands -- and results in his mother's inn being burned down -- he decides there's no better time to seek his fortune and decides to follow the map to the fabled Treasure Planet.  Accompanied by an old family friend, the intelligent but bumbling Dr. Doppler (voiced by the always delightful David Hyde Pierce), he sets sail through the stars in the company of the no-nonsense, tough-as-nails Captain Amelia and the crusty but good-hearted cyborg cook Long John Silver.  But when the crew of the ship turns out to be a band of pirates -- with Silver as their leader -- Jim must use all his wits and courage to save his friends, find Treasure Planet's riches (with the aid of the forgetful half-mad robot B.E.N., voiced by Martin Short), and get safely home.

The look of this film is incredible, and the animators have done a fantastic job of melding traditional animation with CGI -- there are very few instances of the 3D animation clashing with the 2D.  I also enjoyed the blend of old-fashioned and futuristic in terms of the world of this movie -- the old-fashioned sailing ships that are still technologically advanced enough to sail through the stars, the energy pistols fashioned after muskets, and even the robotic refugee B.E.N. looking more clockwork-y than like anything out of Star Wars.  With ""steampunk"" and ""cyber-punk"" becoming more and more popular nowadays, it makes me wonder if this film wasn't ahead of its time, as the world it gives us feels very much like a steampunk fan's dream.

The story, while familiar, has been updated somewhat for modern audiences, and while that can be a bad thing in many cases, it's done quite well here.  There are themes in this film that will resonate with kids and teens today, especially those coming from single-parent homes or who are dealing with their own challenges.  As a child of a single-parent home, I could identify with Jim feeling adrift in his life and seeking a father figure, even if it's one as unconventional as Silver.  And it's nice to find a film where even the villain isn't nearly as nasty as he appears.

While not Disney's best offering to date, this is still a far better film than people give it credit for, and well worth watching if you're a Disney fan or enjoy a good steampunk-flavored tale.  And if it gets kids and teens reading the original ""Treasure Island,"" then so much the better.  Probably best for kids age 10 and up due to violence and some intense scenes.",1379462400,,3887,4.738872403560831

1485574,5,B00005JLR1,"Back in 2002, Disney made an animated film for boys, but sadly, the boys did not flock to the cinemas to see it. That's a shame, because 'Treasure Planet' is actually one of Disney's finest -- and one of the last great hand-drawn animated features (along with Disney's 'Lilo & Stitch', also released in 2002 -- in fact, both 'Treasure Planet' and 'Lilo & Stitch' were Oscar nominated for Best Animated Feature Film, which they lost to Miyazaki's masterpiece 'Spirited Away').

The wonderful thing about home video is that it offers a second chance to great films that somehow slipped through the cracks.

I like B.E.N the robot, Morph the glob parrot, The song ""Always There"", and that villain Scroop. And speaking of villain, here is my one major problem with this movie: the other villain Silver is also a deuterogonist kind of character which is really confusing. He makes friends with Jim Hawkins, yet he is his enemy until the end..uh, yeah that is really confusing and I wish Silver was either one or the other. I don't mind this being a world of aliens and people dressing up in 1600s clothing, it feels unique. So I think this film has a good start but still could use a lot of work.",1377993600,,764,4.1

1485661,4,B00005JLR1,"I remember when I first saw this movie in theaters and was blown away by the marriage of 2D and 3D animation (especially being an aspiring animation student at the time). Silver was done extremely well and I thought that would be the future of feature animation. Turns out I was a little off.

If you look at this movie from a conceptual perspective it's very bold and daring. You take a classic story and give in a sci fi spin, not exactly the easiest thing to do. Then consider Disney was trying to capture a more male audience and you wish this would have done better. It would be nice to have male oriented movies that are a little more edgy with Disney style animation vs. the princess stuff which turns people towards Anime.

The environmental designs are fantastic as are all the ship designs. Aliens crew members could have been a little better, but if you like artistry in Disney movies this is a good one.

The story however falls a little flat, especially when BEN comes into the picture. My one big problem with this movie is it was never sure what it wanted to be. You have an angsty teen looking for purpose in the world which appeals to a more teen based audience (which is fine). Then you have the annoying, slap stick, and extremely LOUD side kick that takes it down to a ""child"" movie. The marrying of the concepts works great, the marrying of these two themes don't. I feel Atlantis suffered a little from this as well.

Over all a good movie, and great on Blu Ray. Just don't expect a fairy tale.",1375747200,,1516,4.384341637010676

It was magic from there on, as she developed a love for great classic stories.

The music is cool, the characters are fun and interesting, and the artwork is beautiful. This blu ray edition is absolutely stunning! One of my favorite scenes starts by looking out a window at the crescent moon, then slowly zooms in. As you get closer, you realize that it's not our moon as it resolves into a crescent space station, and the zoom continues until you get to the ship. An awesome sequence, indicative of the quality of this underrated animated film.",1367280000,,635,4.781818181818182
1485835,4,B00005JLR1,"One of my daughter's favorite Disney movies though it's never gotten much recognition.  Its a pretty well done movie and of course Blu-Ray enhances the experience even more.  I would recommend it as a good family movie which is fairly close to the original ""Treasure Island""",1366934400,,274,4.934782608695652
1485836,4,B00005JLR1,"Until last week, I had never seen Treasure Planet.  I'd read TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson and loved it, even if I prefer KIDNAPPED and think it is criminally underrated compared to its more famous sibling.  But my personal collection of children's movies tends slightly to the girlier side of the spectrum.  (And I did see Titan A.E. in theaters, which came out about the same time, I think.)

But I bought Treasure Planet when I saw it for a good price because I thought it would be a good movie for my nephew.  He comes from a family of women so basically all the pop culture that gets passed on - books, movies, toys - is more geared to little girls.  I think he's getting a great deal of exposure to female role models and won't grow up to think being a girl is bad.  Heck, his favorite movie is Beauty and the Beast.

There are some excellent female characters in Treasure Planet.  Jim's mom is only in the movie for the beginning and end.  She's pretty cool though - a single mother running her own business.  And Captain Amelia is fantastic.  She's professional, but caring.  She's competent and willing to listen to other people when they know what they're talking about.  She doesn't put up with false flattery.

Jim is pretty similar to Lilo (from Lilo and Stitch) in temperament.  A little angry and wild, hurt and frustrated by the loss of a parent.  But Jim is older than Lilo and starting to face real consequences for his youthful indiscretions of trespassing.  When he finds the map to Treasure Planet, it's a real opportunity for him to get some experience and discipline.

If you're familiar with TREASURE ISLAND (or even the Muppets' version), then you know the basic plot of Treasure Planet already.  It's a good plot, filled with adventure, betrayal, and redemption.  I do like how Disney animated it.  The blend of computer and traditional animation doesn't always work.  Some parts really pop due to clearly being made with a computer, but I'm not sure that effect works for me.  (I'm looking at you, space whales.)  But other bits, like John Silver's automaton arm, work beautifully.

I think Treasure Planet is a fun movie.  It's rated PG and skews slightly old for my nephew, who just turned three.  There's an upsetting death of a sympathetic character, but I knew he could handle it due to his reaction to Mufasa's death in The Lion King.  Some kids might be upset by the song sequence that reveals Jim's father walked out on his family.  On the other hand, I think Treasure Planet is a great choice for kids growing up outside of the nuclear family structure.  (And it would make a great double bill with Lilo and Stitch.)",1366761600,3,2664,4.604255319148936
1485837,4,B00005JLR1,"There are things I don't like about this futuristic retelling of ""Treasure Island"" -- I don't like that it promotes a message that teenage boys growing up in single mother households with absent father's rebel, won't find male role models in their lives, that they live dwelling on the resentment.  As my 23-year-old son says, ""Everyone promotes that you're supposed to have problems and feel that way.""  On the other hand, my 12-year-old son adores the creativity that went into putting ""Treasure Island"" into the future... and if I dislike the other message, at least the hero is really a hero and in the end makes good in society,",1366502400,,633,4.798165137614679

this movie is so dull I can barley remember it. the main charactor is nothing but a pretty face.
what falters from the book is that the focus is more of a bro mance rather than a adventure story. It tries to be The Jungle Book rather than Alice in Wonderland. Both excelent. but this is....... so dull.

I'm a 'little girl' who happens to be just over 50 but I feel like there's something special about this movie...it gives my heart a warm fuzzy feeling like when I was young and watched the best cartoons on Saturday mornings.

As far as characters go, the real highlight is the dynamic between Jim and Long John Silver. That should come as no surprise if you're familiar with any version of Treasure Island.

1486376,4,B00005JLR1,"Back in the late 1800s, Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson penned the novel ""Treasure Island"" which was a coming of age novel based on Jim Hawkins, who works on a pirate ship in hopes to find gold.

While ""Treasure Island"" has received several film adaptations as far back as 1918 and a talkie version starring Jackie Cooper and Wallace Beery in 1934, most people may be familiar with the 1950 version because it was Walt Disney Studios first foray into live action film.  And the popularity of Disney's ""Treasure Island"" would lead to a 1954 sequel titled ""Long John Silver"".

Over 50-years after Disney's ""Treasure Island"" was screened in theaters, Disney would once again release go back to the ""Treasure Island"" storyline but give it a sci-fi adaptation titled ""Treasure Planet"" and the film would become the 43rd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line.

""Treasure Planet"" would be co-directed by Ron Clements and John Musker (the duo known for their work on ""Aladdin"", ""The Princess and the Frog"", ""The Little Mermaid"") and a film that would feature the voices of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Inception"", ""(500) Days of Summer"", ""50/50, ""3rd Rock from the Sun""), Laurie Metcalf (""Roseanne"", ""The Big Bang Theory""), Emma Thompson (""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Harry Potter"" films""), Martin Short (""Father of the Bride"", ""Innerspace""), David Hyde Pierce (""Frasier"", ""Sleepless in Seattle""), Roscoe Lee Brown (""Logan's Run"", ""The Cowboys"") and Patrick McGoohan (""Braveheart"", ""Danger Man"", ""Secret Agent"").

The film would employ the ""70/30 Law"" which mean the film would feature 70% traditional artwork and 30% sci-fi and featured art that was promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration.  And that was to give a ""classic storybook illustration"" style utilizing a painted style with a warm color pallette.

While the reviews from critics for the film was split, unfortunately, ""Treasure Planet"" was one of the few modern Disney animated films that did not do well in the box office but did very well in home video sales when the DVD was released back in 2003.

And now, ""Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition"" has been released on Blu-ray courtesy of Disney.

VIDEO:

""Treasure Planet"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1 aspect ratio).  And one thing I can say for this film is that it is very colorful.  Utilizing the 70/30 law of creating 70% traditional art and 30% sci-fi, while the CG renderings are good for its time and still manage to hold up quite well in 2012 (despite not having great detail as today's CG films), the film still looks good.  Colors are vibrant (with little banding and also mild artifacts are preset) and detail is present.  Having owned the 2003 DVD, I can say that the detail seen in this film is the biggest difference between the Blu-ray and DVD versions is the detail.  But the film looks incredible on Blu-ray, not perfect but still a major upgrade from its 2003 DVD counterpart.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Treasure Planet"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And this soundtrack is quite immersive!  From the ambiance of Jim outside his mother's restaurant, you can hear the thunder rumbling.  Or during the more action intense sequences as weapons are being shot at each other, the booby traps that cause severe damage sounds fantastic via lossless.  There are many action scenes in which the lossless soundtrack just sounds incredible and immersive.  Surround channels are used frequently, as with the LFE.  And also, the dialogue and music composition by James Newton Howard (""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Unbreakable"") are crystal clear.  Audiophiles should be happy with the lossless soundtrack of ""Treasure Island"".

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A coming-of-age story.  A story about adventure.  A story filled with excitement, action and more!

Disney's sci-fi animated film, ""Treasure Planet"" is indeed a Disney family film that is exciting and entertaining but sometimes there are films that you feel are good but yet don't resonate well with the audience.  This is one of them.

In the case of ""Treasure Planet"", many critics enjoyed the film but yet many people didn't watch it when it came out and unfortunately, ""Treasure Planet"" has the distinction of being one of Disney's modern animated films that didn't do well in the box office.

The film tried to be different by focusing on sci-fi action, space pirates and a futuristic alternate version of ""Treasure Island"" and I enjoyed the action and the visuals at the time.  And its storyline of a young man getting the opportunity to make something of himself and traveling through the universe is quite exciting.

But then again...I realized that watching it ten years later, the storyline plot didn't have the Disney magic that people are used to. And the characters, unlike other Disney films that tend to lean towards fantasy or feature a younger or cuter character, there is an obvious trend of how animated films perform of those that stick to the Disney formula of being a family film that attracts people of all ages.  And then there are animated films that tend to reach out to not necessarily the young children but slightly older kids and families.

The thing is, Ron Clements and John Musker are a directorial duo who are known for revitalizing Disney with ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"".  But they are also creators who are creative and think outside of the box and during this age of animated cinema where people are used to seeing Pixar-based films, both Clements and Musker have continued to go the path of creating animation the traditional way.

From 1985 and working on ""The Black Cauldron"" (a film that did terribly for Disney but yet has its cult followers who appreciate it because it was different and also quite dark).  The same thing can be said with the duo's last film ""The Priness and the Frog"", a return to traditional animation, having a happy but also dark storyline and so different than what people are used to seeing from Disney.

Both Clements and Musker are used to thinking outside of the box and its a great thing.  They revitalized Disney through the creation of ""The Little Mermaid"" and I'm glad that Disney has let them continue.  But the problem is that compared to Pixar animated films which have been consistent moneymaking films for the company, these type of films that Clements and Musker make may be appreciated by their fans who appreciate their creativity and use of traditional animation.  I sure am a fan of the duo and their work, but I also realize, that Disney is an everchanging company that prides itself on big money making films.

So, what could have caused people to not watch the film?  For one, Disney films tend to captivate their young viewers.  Yes, the films captivate people of all ages but the characters are important for a Disney film.  The majority of the people focused in this film are guys.  There was no princess, there was no female character aside from Jim's mother and Captain Amelia who are barely seen in the film.  And when watching the film with my nine-year-old, he thought the character of Jim Hawkins was cool but found the character of John Silver, too creepy!

According to my son, when I asked him what he didn't like about the film, he felt that outside of Jimmy and his mother, everyone else seemed to creepy for him.  Granted, this is in an era where humans interact with alien species.  So, aliens that are not cute, may turn some children off.

I also suppose that back then, I was drawn by the action and the special effects and overall animation a bit too much and I never really sat back and enjoyed the plot of the film. When you consider the children watching the film, the special effects are not what they are keeping an eye out for.  They care about how fun the film is, the humor, the craziness but also their desire for a captivating plot but most importantly, how likeable the characters are and I realize that although the creative crew went outside of the box of this film, the children who are used to seeing cute characters in Disney films were not getting that in ""Treasure Planet"".

You had an alien with many extensions out of his body that makes flatulent sounds, you have alien pirates who are not exactly likeable, a lobster like antagonist who was not likeable and it leaves you with few characters that the children can get into.  Doctor Doppler and Captain Amelia are used sporadically and the film literally relies on Jim Hawkins, John Silver and Morph.  Jim may be cool, Morph may be cute and funny but John Silver, as my son would say... too creepy!

I realize now that while I enjoyed the popcorn action aspect of the film, for a Disney film, the storyline was not as dramatic and it was missing a little of that Disney magic.  And when the film premiered back during the 2002 holiday season, especially with Christmas coming up, you want to see Disney magic in full force.  And ""Treasure Planet"" wasn't that type of film.  Dare I say, an animated sci-fi popcorn action film.  It's what it is!

For parents who are concerned about the PG rating, the alien characters may frighten younger children but for the most part, the film is not scary.  The PG deals with adventure and peril, as these characters do risk their lives in finding the mysterious treasure.  And there are characters that do die in this film.  So, parental guidance is suggested!

As for the Blu-ray release, there are a lot of special features included on this Blu-ray release of ""Treasure Planet"". Granted, if you own the original 2003 DVD, this is the same release in terms of special features but you do get an awesome transfer with a pretty solid lossless soundtrack.  Also, you do get a DVD included with the Blu-ray release.

Overall, by no means was ""Treasure Planet"" a bad movie, nor was it great.  There are a lot of action sequences featured throughout the film but I can see if young boys dig the film more than girls.  But for people who enjoy watching popcorn action films, then definitely give ""Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition"" on Blu-ray a try!",1352332800,,12894,4.983629560336763

We rented this through Amazon's Instant Video and saw it before purchasing it.  Found that I really love the movie and I think it's more for me than for him.  Emma Thompson with her voice talent for Captain Amelia is excellent and lends very much to the feel of the movie and the language is not just words, but well written in her speech.  When you watch this, you see a lot developing and at times emotions are high.  I don't want to give too much away in this review, but I do give it a 5 star for the creativity and building up of the major characters.  It's interesting how much kids pick up in the movie.

1486383,4,B00005JLR1,"Disney's release of Treasure Planet on Blu-Ray I'm sure will introduce a lot of young children to a great movie that will find it's way into a lot of favorite lists.  This movie has a lot going for it, and should certainly make it into the collection of any parents that want their children(especially boys) to watch great wholesome adventure.

Great things about the movie:
1.  The script!  Of course this movie is a retelling of the book classic, ""Treasure Island"", and it stays right with the plot of the book.  I wondered how they would accomplish such a feat being the setting is so different, but they do and do it well.

2.  The setting!  I love the sci-fi element to the movie.  When you look at the setting and layout you see a little of old and new.  In the special features the designers said they followed a 70-30 rule in that 70 percent was new technology and 30 percent was old technology.  So you see giant sailing ships that sail in space, and laser guns that look like muskets.  VERY COOL!

3.  the cast.  Hawkins plays a good character that is likeable but just as in Disney's movie ""Treasure Island"" and in the book by Stevenson, Silver, the cook/pirate steals the show and is the most developed likeable scoundrel in the story.

This really is a good movie.  If I were to judge it by animated movies outside of Disney I would say it's an AWESOME movie.  But when you measure it up against Lion King, Aladdin, or Peter Pan, it doesn't exactly hit the mark.  I would put this movie in the Disney Realm of the Fox & Hound, Tarzan, or Hercules, good(3 stars) but not great.

I give the movie 3 stars, BUT I added one star because of the creativity of the setting.
Great movie, you boys will love it!",1347235200,,1715,4.367088607594937
1486384,5,B00005JLR1,I really like this movie. Captain silver was the kind of character you find yourself really liking even though he's supposed to be the villain.,1346976000,,143,4.76
1486515,4,B00005JLR1,"Treasure Planet is one of Disney's most obscure and unpopular movies. When it arrived in theaters on Nov. 2002, the film was a box office bomb failing to recoup even half its production cost. It received some recognition and it was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature but after this, it was condemned to oblivion.

That's a shame actually since Treasure Planet is a great movie. It's not up there with the Disney classics or can be called a masterpiece but has enough power to be given a chance and this BD is the perfect opportunity to revisit or check this underrated treasure for the first time.

Treasure Planet adapts the Robert Louis Stevenson's classic ""Treasure Island"" and converts the high sea adventure into an epic space adventure. The story follows Jim Hawkins, a 15 year old who lives with his mother and can't stay out of trouble. His father abandoned him when he was younger and this has affected Jim throughout his short life. His mother can't seem to understand him and Jim doesn't know where his place is. One day, an opportunity is given to Jim to finally prove himself and go in a quest that will change his life: the search of the mysterious Treasure Planet where an incalculable treasure is buried. Action, drama and adventure ensures in this epic journey.

Treasure Planet does a lot things right. It's fast paced, its animation is breathtaking, the score is magnificent and the central characters are well developed. The filmmakers capture teen angst in a perfect and poignant way. The relationship between Jim and Silver is handled very well and is a much more complicated relationship than your typical animated film. All this makes the story engaging and interesting for everyone.

Unfortunately, there are other things that Treasure Planet do not handle very well and the main problem are the supporting characters. They are not very well developed and the movie suffers as a result. The ship crew are random alien creatures which add nothing to the picture, it's like the animators just wanted to be crazy but the final result is not engaging. The relationship between Captain Amelia and Doctor Doppler feels forced but the greatest flaw is the robot B.E.N. The character almost ruined the movie. Is over the top and obnoxious in every single scene he's in. I know he was meant for laughs but his antics are unfunny throughout the film. All these characters take weight from the central emotional core of the film and should have been handled better, especially the robot.

Anyhow, flaws and all, Treasure Planet is still a high spirited adventure with a great message and impeccable technical presentation. It does not deserve the reputation it has and hopefully more people will re-discover it and give it a better place in the Disney canon.

Video & Audio
Treasure Planet debuts on BD in a near perfect presentation. Some minor banding appears in some scenes but nothing to be concern about. The picture is crystal clear, colors pop off the screen and detail and delineation is just breathtaking. This is one of Disney's best BD presentations.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is a bombastic experience with good directionality and crystal clear dialogue. A wonderful experience all around.

Bonus Features
While no new bonus material was produced for this BD, most of the DVD material has been carried over and while is not as extensive as it could, most of the material is engaging and informative.

You have an audio commentary with the filmmakers and several featurettes concerning the making of the film and the different stages of production (animation, design, music, story, etc), publicity material and more.

A DVD copy is also included.

Final Thoughts
Treasure Planet is an epic adventure that makes for an enjoyable experience. It's not perfect and has some glaring flaws but the final product is far better than its reputation would suggest. It's not Disney's best but it isn't its worst either and deserves to be seen at least once. This BD makes things easier with an impeccable technical presentation and worthy bonus material. Treasure Planet is recommended.",1345766400,15,4121,4.923631123919308

No matter how much I tried, the dvd wouldn't play. I checked the disc to find that it was beaten up with scratches!

1486522,5,B00005JLR1,"When comparing this new Blu-ray to the old DVD, I was very surprised to find that the old wide-screen DVD is actually CROPPED!
This new Blu-ray presents much more picture on the top and bottom as well as on the right side! There are black bars on the sides of the screen to bring the picture in to it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:66-1 (which is not as wide as wide-screen TVs).

The old DVD stated on the back that it was also 1:66-1 aspect ratio but that was a lie, the top & bottom are cropped to present the picture in 1:85-1 aspect ratio.
To add to the cropping problem the old DVD also cropped the right side! This means that even more picture from the top & bottom got cropped off than necessary to create the 1:85-1 aspect ratio.

The presentation on the new Blu-ray disc is much sharper and the colors are way more vibrant!  It is almost like seeing the movie fresh and new, like never before.

--As far as the story, it is an OVERLOOKED CLASSIC!  Really!  I have enjoyed it since day-one! My wife had never wanted to see this because of the early reviews, after she saw it she was shocked at how good it was, calling it a ""must see"". She is probably not the only animation fan who has deprived themselves of this classic for the past 10 years. Now is a great time to remedy this and buy this Blu-ray!

The adventure is fast and well paced,  the characters are fun to watch, and the animation is great!",1342569600,,1421,4.256505576208179
1486523,5,B00005JLR1,"It is my personal opinion that this is the single most underrated Disney film ever made. It deserves way more attention than it gets. It's an amazing adventure story that was translated seamlessly from classic to sci-fi. The animation is awesome, the use of CGI was spot on and the amount of character development in this story out-does most other Disney films. This is pure adventure and I wish Disney would make more like it. This movie is good for anyone at any age.",1342483200,,469,4.595238095238095
1486524,4,B00005JLR1,"Hopefully someday, when they make a sequel to the excellent documentary to Waking Sleeping Beauty (Waking Pocahontas maybe?), we'll see how Treasure Planet figured into the behind-the-scenes nachinations of the post-Katzenberg Disney animation division. One can't help but wonder whether Treasure Planet fell victim to some of these politics, or, as perhsps it was with John Carter, the public just didn't want a scifi/space version of Treasure Island.

The film itself is jaw-droppingly impressive. Few films from any studio have blended cel animation with CG as perfectly, created such vivid, vulnerable characters and such breathtaking, detailed panoramas. Seeing it on the new Blu-ray is almost like seeing it for the first time, unless perhaps you saw it in IMAX. Every line and every miniscule object or person in the distance can be seen in razor sharp clarity.

Maybe the visual scope and tech detail overwhelms the characters and the narrative, as some suggested was the case with Sleeping Beauty. However, there's some superb acting here, including the now-A lister Joseph-Gordon Levitt as Jim Hawkins, Brian Murray as Silver, Martin Short as BEN, Emma Thompson as Captain Amelia and the always dependable David Hyde-Pierce as Doppler (a character that suggests those Duckburg ""dog people"" from vintage Disney comics).

The generous bonus features, pretty much the same ones from the earlier DVD release, are very copious. Instead of an audio commentary, there is a vast ""Visual Commentary"" that starts and stops the film with supplemental information, stretching the experience out well over two hours. A feast for animation fans.

My son loved this movie when he was seven and he loves it today. It was an attempt to grab the non-Princess audience for Disney features, and while it would never attract the ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" older males, it's great stuff for younger kids.

Be sure to show your kids Walt Disney's original Treasure Island to compare and contrast the storyline. The relationship between Silver and Hawkins is more from Walt and less from Stevenson. And hey, reading the classic book is nice, too!",1342396800,,2128,5.2105263157894735
1486665,5,B00005JLR1,"And I don't call it ""My Favorite Movie"" lightly. I've seen the movie about 273 times... not to say that I have enough time to watch it that many times, but I've owned the movie since it came out, and I used to watch it every night when I was a teenager. This is the kind of movie that you might be steered away from because it's not very well known, or because of its bad rep. If you give this movie a chance, you will love it. And that's a promise. Go watch ""I'm Still Here"" on Youtube. It's the song that plays during the movie to display a key emotional point in the life of Jim Hawkins. That will just be a taste. But this movie is very worthy of your Disney collection. It's got adventure, humor, a little love, and tons of heart (which is what makes a Disney movie). The only reason anybody will say ""this movie is a dishonor to the Disney name"", or ""it's not worth the hour and a half it takes to watch it"" is because they saw the movie once, with some previous speculation, and never gave it a 2nd glance. You really honestly have to be heartless to hate this movie. I mean, I understand if you don't enjoy animated movies, or it's lack of action, or maybe you didn't take the movie seriously at all and made fun of it the whole time (out loud, or in your mind), but this movie is definitely in the ranks of the Disney Classics. It's got everything the rest of the Disney classics have: adventure, humor, love, heart. That's all it takes to have a Disney Classic. Watch it at least 3 times, and I promise you it will be one of your favorite movies.",1341964800,,1556,4.138613861386139
1486666,4,B00005JLR1,"Leave it to Disney to come up with a way to update Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale ""Treasure Island"" into a science fiction epic. The studio that brought you the unforgettable live-action film version returned to the source material once again with the idea of taking the adventure into deep space and to other worlds. Unfortunately, moviegoers weren't interested in ""Treasure Planet"" when it came out in 2002. The film underperformed at the box office but was still nominated for a 2002 Academy Award in the category of Best Animated Feature.

Thanks to every movie on the planet receiving the high definition treatment, audiences get the chance to give this entertaining film another chance with the release of ""Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition."" It's hard to believe the movie came out 10 years ago. It was the first to be released in IMAX and regular theaters on the same day. The movie is also of importance as a shining example of 2D hand drawn art used on top of 3D computer animation.

Not much changes in ""Treasure Planet"" as far as story and characters go. It still revolves around Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who discovers a holographic treasure map that supposedly leads to a pirate's loot on a far-off planet. Hawkins and his mentor Dr. Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) embark on a trek across the stars on a ship whose crew is made up of dangerous aliens led by a mutineering cyborg named Long John Silver (Brian Murray). Can Jim and the rest of the loyal crew of the ship find the treasure and collect it before the traitorous buccaneers do?

This will relate to fans of sci-fi both young and old. It takes the great classic tale and successfully makes it relevant to kids in the 21st century used to watching ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and other movies and TV shows that take them to other worlds. The pacing of the film is good and the story will keep the viewer's attention.

The high definition transfer of the film is magnificent. The picture is crystal clear and filled with bright and vivid colors that keep your eyes glued to the screen. The 5.1 surround further brings to life James Newton Howard's musical score and the anthemic pop songs of Goo Goo Dolls' John Rzeznik. The explosions, laser shots, and flying ships will jump out at you from all over your home entertainment center with this great audio mix.

Special features for the film include 43-minutes of production featurettes introduced by actor Laurie Metcalf and a ""behind-the-scenes"" one entitled ""Disney's Animation Magic."" There's also comprehensive feature commentary with co-directors/co-writers Ron Clements and John Musker, producer Roy Conli, and supervising animators John Ripa, Ian Gooding, and Glen Keane. Three unfinished deleted scenes are included with introductions by directors Ron Clements and John Musker. A 17-minute ""R.L.S. Legacy: Virtual 3D Tour"" and the six-part ""DisneyPedia: The Life of a Pirate Revealed"" featurette are here as well.

The ""Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition"" gives movie lovers a second chance to see this excellent example of how hand drawn and computer animation can co-exist. The story is complex enough for adults yet simple enough for children to take in. A great feature film and plenty of bonus material make this a recommended buy for Disney and sci-fi fans alike.",1341619200,14,3326,4.9837837837837835

They made it original and new, which isn't done too many times with movies anymore. I love all the little characters in this movie. I wish I had a real life Morph!!!

Certainly, the cinematography is excellent, as are both the computer animated and hand drawn sequences. The technical presentation of the film on blu-ray is certainly first rate. Both the video and audio aspects of the film are very good.

However the plot seems a bit forced, as does the juxtaposition of 18th century sailing vessels, and associated crew members, with advanced technology, including robots, cyborgs and interstellar space travel. While the plot is coherent, and at times interesting, it just doesn't feel right, as if the directors and producers could not decide if they wanted to have a pirate film, with all the trappings implied with such a film, or an interstellar space travel film. In the end, they tried to do both and it just doesn't come out right.

Will the kids watch the movie again? Probably. Will it become one of their favorite films? Probably not. Is it a good distraction for kids and adults for an evening spent watching a movie? Yes.",1341446400,3,1169,4.720588235294118

Second, it's a very nice adaptation of Stevenson's story, obviously compressed and slightly Disneyfied, but with the basic psychological drama -- Jim's coming of age and Silver's moral ambiguity -- quite intact. Third, Silver's character is just so well done, dominating the screen visually and in voice acting, just as he does in the book.

1486840,4,B00005JLR1,"Like many films in the Disney library, Treasure Planet was not the financial success Disney expected. And like so many financially unsuccessful Disney films, this one had the potential of spawning a series continuation. The setting, the characters, they're all very nice and memorable. We all remember Long John Silver (a.k.a. Cyborg), Morph, Jim Hawkins, and a few others so I think either sequels or a TV series should have come out of this. The story of Jim Hawkins looking for treasure is well known to us all. Especially those of us who watched Muppet Treasure Island a million times. (""We're gonna be rich!"" ""We're gonna be dead..."")

But anyway, Treasure Planet is an underrated movie plagued by a difficult production cycle. It was simply too expensive and too difficult to make when the director initially intended to make it so he patiently waited while not-so-subtly whispering into Disney's ear saying ""Can I make the movie yet? Huh? Huh? Can I? Can I?"" And so like a child who REALLY wanted the cookie, Disney ultimately decided to make Treasure Planet be they're next feature film at the time. Starring actors that, well, never heard of, except for one that I wouldn't know until YEARS later. Anyone else know that Jim Hawkins in this movie is played by Joseph Gordon Levitt? Yeah, Arthur from Inception anyone? How cool is that? Hey I guess you gotta start somewhere right? So anyway, Disney eventually took the James Cameron's Avatar route and waiting like 10 and finally made Treasure Planet. Which couldn't be made before due to the director's heavy want of mixing 2D animation with 3D environments. Did it succeed? Yeah I'd say they do for the most part. Occasionally it's distracting but ultimately I'd say they did an okay job.

While I love Treasure Planet as ""That Movie I Watched a Hundred Times on VHS"" it's not without it's fair share of problems. For the record, I never understood why everyone could breathe in space. The aliens I could understand but Jim, Silver, and others can just go into space, and just go about their business. Wow those astronauts at NASA are spending too much time and money on equipment because apparently we could breathe in space all this time! Martin Short as Ben overstays his welcome A LOT but he does make the ending scene with the planet about to explode fairly more epic with his worried yelling and screaming. And when they finally open the portal and walk inside the Treasure Room inside the planet? Looking back now, there is an enormous fact that eluded me for years. When they walk through the portal, Flint's only security method of protecting the treasure... was a laser trip wire. Um, oh wow. So you're telling me that in this alternate future, the most creative set-up Flint could think up to protect his treasure, was something you'd see protecting a supermarket or Best Buy? And it's not like the laser was hard to see, it was bright red and everything. So just because they didn't look down, they set off the booby trap. So that whole final act of the treasure falling to the core and the planet blowing up could have ALL been avoided if they looked down, and stepped over the laser. They could have taken the treasure and everyone'd be happy. Major flaw.

But I digress, do I still love this movie? Of course I do. Granted it's not the perfect Disney film nor would it be the first I'd show my kids, but there's enough eye-candy, likeable characters, story, and special effects for me to recommend this movie and I really am excited to see it's release on Blu-ray. My family has a 60"" Samsung HDTV with Surround Sound and a movie like this would really shine. I never expected this movie to come to Blu-ray, and I'm really excited it is. Maybe now we'll see some other underrated movies like Atlantis: The Lost Empire come to Blu-ray. Shame it doesn't come with a Digital Copy though but that's okay. I already bought it on iTunes so anyone who wants this movie on the go can look there. I'm really looking forward to this release and like a good ol' cyborg said, ""It's got the making of greatness!""",1333324800,9,4074,4.663421418636996

1487002,5,B00005JLR1,"Treasure Planet was not a blockbuster hit like its predecessors, through no fault of its own. It is one of Disney's rare cult classics, gathering a small but rabid following of fans who praise its beautiful, revolutionary art direction, including the use of fully-mapped CGI environments upon which the characters were animated, and the fun, genuine voices of the all-star cast including Emma Thompson, David Hyde Pierce, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It is a true Disney story with its young protagonist, Jim Hawkins, growing from a sullen teenager to a brave, hard-working young adult in one amazing adventure through space.

The story was pulled from Robert Louis Stevenson's swashbuckling masterpiece Treasure Island, in which the young Jim Hawkins grows to care for his mentor John Silver and is therefore devastated to learn that his teacher is in fact a pirate in disguise, looking to mutiny along with the rest of the crew. The story is translated to sci-fi amazingly well, using a 70-30 ratio for the mise-en-scene of the whole thing. 70% is true to its original tale; characters wear 18th century fashion, the architecture of the spaceport is all Georgian, and the ship on which they travel is a beautiful three-mast schooner with a few modifiers for the journey. 30% is sci-fi, with laser guns, giant holographic treasure maps, and a crew of exotic aliens ranging from cute to downright scary.

(Detractors of the movie quickly point out that the ship is not closed, and how could they be breathing in space anyway? The directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, revealed in the 'Art of...' book that the universe where they live does not work with the same properties as ours. There is air and weather in space, as well as nebulas and dying stars to make the journey treacherous.)

Treasure Planet as a whole deserves more credit. It features all the basics of a Disney classic: a handsome, sympathetic main character; a diabolical antagonist who you come to care for as much as the heroes; a bumbling sidekick and his leading-lady love interest; and the slightly-annoying Third Act Addition character. The story carries as much heart as, say, Lion King or Pinocchio. The art is truly stunning; just sit back and watch the colors of space swirl across your TV screen, or the subtle-but-perfect facial expressions of the characters. Clements and Musker admit much time and thought was put into the eye movements of the characters, trying to make them look as real-life as possible.

Last but not least, I need to mention and rave about the score. James Newton Howard really seemed to throw himself into making the soundtrack as beautifully classic as possible, with a full orchestra really setting the mood for a pirate tale set in the 1700's. It has several moments of pure adrenaline, pure bittersweet happiness, and pure longing for your own ship and crew to take to the stars.

The picture quality for the Blu-ray is sound. The transition up from standard def did not result in the sparkling white of the drawn lines that afflicted the Beauty and the Beast Blu-ray; everything here is crisp and clear and smooth, and the upscale resulted in the most vibrant colors I've ever seen from this movie. The background of space in its swirls of blues and purples and the warm and cool colors of the digital lighting from fire to nighttime are better than they've ever been. The CGI parts of the movie were also upgraded with the release; one of the detractors of the film was that the brand-new computer graphic technology looked janky or amateur. Not anymore. Now it fits seamlessly into the 2D world and you barely notice it.

The sound of the movie blew me right out of my living room. Granted, I do have Bose speakers, but I've watched my DVD of Treasure Planet plenty of times, and never before has it sounded so grand and clear. It was clearly tinkered with, to give even more life to this movie. I heard background noises that I've never noticed before, like the conversion had made them better.

The ONLY, ONLY ONLY ONLY, problem I had with this release was that the special features have all been seen before. The only new parts were introductions to each section of feature (art direction, characters, animation, development, etc.) by Laurie Metcalf, the actress who voiced Jim's mother Sarah Hawkins. The interviews with the creators and directors were all on the DVD, and they're included on the Blu-ray in standard def, with black borders and pixellated images reminding you that you're watching featurettes from 10 years ago.

Regardless, this is a Blu-ray worth buying and treasuring forever. Since I never, ever believed it would come out in 1080p glory, I'm about to fall to my knees and kiss Disney's boots. You will not regret giving this larger-than-life movie a chance, and I'm willing to bet you will find it a welcome addition to your Disney Blu-ray collection.",1332028800,88,4886,4.857142857142857

If you've seen any films based off of 'Treasure Island' tale, then this story will be nothing new to you. But, it's still fun to watch with it's unique design route, full of alien races and futuristic technology mixed with a 17th century theme, hence the 'steam-punk'. This film received a lot of mixed reviews, some loved it and wanted a sequel, others disliked entirely. I guess this was one of Disney's attempts to make a cartoon targeted toward teenagers, and they somewhat succeeded with positive feedback. I like this version of the main character, Jim Hawkins. His hairdo is awesome and he's a likeable character. Long-John Silver is a fat cyborg, half human, half robot, and he's like who you'd expect him to be: he likes Jim, but his plan to take the legendary treasure for himself gets in the way, so his bad side is revealed throughout the film. The story ends kind of abruptly, but basically, well, you know. Everything turns out better for Jim and his mother.

1487207,5,B00005JLR1,"Treasure Planet is a Disney animated film based on another Disney classic, Treasure Island-but with a Science Fiction twist. The story centers around Jim Hawkins(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young adventurer, who is told the story of a space pirate's fortune located in a far-away planet. At the insistance of his Mom(Laurie Metcalf), Hawkins journeyed to the planet on the Space boat R.L.S. Legacy(a nod to Robert Louis Stevenson)with his guardian Dr. Delbert Doppler(David Hyde Pierce) and the ship's Captain, Amelia(Emma Thompson). Along the way, the crew are confronted by a hearty alien buccaneer named John Silver, who reluctantly joins the crew as they fight off rival pirates and avoid intergalatic dangers in order to find the Treasure Planet and its riches. The special features includes a classic trailer for Disney's Treasure Island and a behind-the-scenes look the the film.

Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a far-future slacker who unexpectedly falls heir to a high-tech treasure map when its dying alien owner, Billy Bones (Patrick McGoohan), crash-lands on the dock of his mother's (Laurie Metcalf) inn, warning with his last gasp to ""beware the cyborg!""  When Bones's pursuers attack the place, the Hawkinses' boarder Doctor Doppler (David Hyde-Pierce) manages to get them away, then arranges for a ship to take them in search of what may be the legendary horde of a famous space pirate.  The felinoid Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) and her faithful mate Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne), however, don't realize that the cook they've hired, John Silver (Brian Murray), is the very cyborg Bones was talking about, and has recruited a crew of scoundrels with mutiny in mind.  The greatest attractions of this version of the classic tale are the solar-sail ships, CGI backgrounds, and a cast of alien spacefarers that beats anything seen since the Mos Eisley cantina.  (There are also some scary bits, particularly Scroop (Michael Wincott), one of Silver's band, who looks very spidery and acts even nastier than he looks.)

1487272,2,B00005JLR1,"Even more of a lowpoint for Disney animation than their troubled 70s-early 80s films, it's hard to think of a worse animated feature from the studio than Treasure Planet. It's one of those pitches that sounds like a really bad idea when you hear it - a sci-fi version of Treasure Island with galleons as spaceships and a cyborg Long John Silver - but which, when you see it, turns out to be even worse than it looked.

It's from that period at the beginning of the century when Disney started to be running scared of the competition, changing their plans based purely on what their rivals were doing. Having turned Kingdom of the Sun, a half-completed epic drama into all-out comedy The Emperor's New Groove to compete with DreamWorks' Road to El Dorado, they then developed two animated adventures to counter the renewed threat of Don Bluth and his surprisingly good but hugely unsuccessful Titan AE. While Atlantis worked well enough until it reached its destination and fell foul of clumsy anime/New Age clich&eacute;s, Treasure Planet never even gets off the starting blocks. It's colourful and very expensive looking without ever being particularly visually appealing, while despite a story by Pirates of the Caribbean writers, there's little wit here (a few verbal gymnastics from Emma Thompson's feline captain aside). Suspension of disbelief is a major problem - just how does everyone breathe in space? - but even bigger is the way the film confuses haste for excitement, in a constant rush that never allows it to create interesting characters or credible worlds as it races from one CGi heavy sequence to another, constantly throwing in uninvolving set pieces that are supposed to make you go WOW! but are more likely to evoke yawns as it trudges mechanically through a thousand animation clich&eacute;s.

The Disney movie is an update version of Treasure Island with a mixture of old and new technology. The movie revolves around a teenage boy named Jim Hawkins; whose father abandoned him years ago and secretly yearns for a father figure. One evening a spaceship crashes near the inn. A turtle like creature emerges from the ship calling himself Billy Bones. He tells Jim pirates are after his treasure. Once inside, Billy Bones give Jim an orb package and warns him of the cyborg. Just a few seconds later a gang of pirates arrives and tear the inn apart looking for the orb. Jim, his mother, and Dr. Delbert Doppler manage to escape before they are capture. They arrive at the home of Dr. Doppler and Jim opens the package and discovers that the orb is a map of the universe and a map to Treasure Planet and Captain Flint's treasure. Dr. Doppler hires a crew and ship and the two set sail for a treasure hunt. Captain Amelia makes Jim a Cabin Boy and assigns him to John Silver, the ship's cook and a cyborg. Jim suspects John Silver is the cyborg. Originally John and Jim wanted nothing to do with each other, but during the course of the movie John sort of become the father figure Jim is looking for. During a black hole storm First Mate Mr. Arrow is lost to a black hole when his life line is cut by Scroop, but Jim blames himself because he was put in charge of securing the life lines. RLS Legacy reaches Treasure Planet a mutiny takes place. Jim, Captain Amelia, and Dr. Doppler crash land on the planet. Once on the planet, Jim shows Amelia that the map is safe, but when he takes it out of his pocket it is actually Morph. Amelia is injured during the landing and tells Jim to scout ahead to find shelter. Jim and Morph run into B.E.N. B.E.N. claims to have literally lost his memory. B.E.N. invites them to take shelter in his place. Later that evening B.E.N., Morph, and Jim escape through a back to and head back to the ship to get the map. The trio recover the map and head back to the hideout and find John Silver and his gang has capture Amelia and Doppler and are about to kill them when John cannot get the orb to work. Finally he strikes up a deal and the prisoners all go with the pirates. Jim finds Captain Flint hideout and the treasure, but in doing unknowingly so set off a destruct signal. Jim and B.E.N. are at Captain Flint ship when Jim finds B.E.N. and put it back on. B.E.N., with his memory restored tells Jim why Flint took it off in the first place. He did so no one would find his treasure and if they did would set off a plant self destruct signal. It is a race to get off the planet. Jim, B.E.N., and John arrive back at the ship; however the ship is damaged and does not lack the fire power to get off the planet. Jim tells Doppler to turn the ship around because he is heading for the orb to set the portal to his home world. Everybody makes it out of the explosion alive and Jim helps John to escape. John leaves Jim with some treasure so his mom can rebuild her inn. Captain Amelia and Dr. Delbert Doppler get married, Jim's mom opens a new inn, and Jim makes his mom proud of him. I am giving Treasure Planet an AAAA++++ for the use of combining 2D animation with 3D computer animation.

It is funny, and has a ton of action which is great for the kids, and it shows the growth of a young boy into a man, which is an important idea for kids to learn, even if they learn it from a cartoon. This is very losely based on the Treasure Island story, but it is futuristic, and I think that they pull the story off very well. They voice actors were a great choice, and I think that this is overall one of my favorite fantasy cartoons to date. The use of pirates in the future was done quite well, and they kept the older elements of sword play while adding robots, aliens, and flying ships. This is definitly high on my list of must see movies.",1238198400,,699,4.0359712230215825

1487277,4,B00005JLR1,"Directed by Disney's Ron Clements and John Musker, comes the astounding tale of adventure, growing-up and heroism. Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stars as a teenage boy who is lost in a sea of sadness and trouble. When a mysterious star ship crashes onto the dock of the Benbo Inn, Jim investigates and finds a dying pilot by the name of Billy Bones, who gives him a treasure chest and warns him of ""The Cyborg.""
Earlier that day, Jim was in trouble for speeding on his Solar Surfer in a restricted area, and was brought home to the disappointment of his mother, Sarah Hawkins (Laurie Metcalf). She points out to a close family-friend; a dog-like being by the name of Doctor Doppler, (David Hyde Pierce) that Jim has been a trouble-maker ever since his father left. She is ""literally,"" at the end of her rope and doesn't know what to do to motivate her son.
But ever since Jim was little, he dreamed of finding the ""Loot of a Thousand Worlds,"" which is stowed away at the farthest reaches of the galaxy. This loot was collected by the notorious Captain Flint, who kept it all in a place known as: Treasure Planet (Ring any bells? Of course, Treasure Planet is based off of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel: Treasure Island, which was written way back in 1883).
After recovering the chest from Billy Bones and carrying him back to his mother's inn, the place is soon attacked by a group of pirates. Jim and the others (excluding Billy Bones, who died soon before and opened the chest for Jim) race up to the second story and escape by leaping down to a carriage provided by Doctor Doppler. The inn is destroyed and nothing is left for the Hawkins family but an odd little sphere from the chest.
The sphere is soon revealed to be a map to the one place Jim has dreamed of journeying to; Treasure Planet. After arguing with his mother, and with the help of Doctor Doppler, they commission the RLS Legacy which is crewed by an odd group of characters, First Mate Mr. Arrow and its sharp-minded Captain Amelia.
Jim is brought down to the kitchen where he meets The Cook, Mr. John Silver, a cyborg with a strange gold eye who has a pet called Morph, an adorable shape-shifter. A father/son relationship forms between the two, which is shown between chores and flashbacks of Jim's childhood with the song sung by John Rzeznik, ""I'm Still Here.""
But the adventure turns senile when Mr. Silver reveals himself as Captain Silver, a pirate who is after the map. Jim and the few loyal fugitives, including Captain Amelia and Doctor Doppler ""jump ship,"" and escape to Treasure Planet where the adventure continues in ""cat-and-mouse-game,"" between Jim and Silver. There Jim meets Flint's abandoned robot B.E.N (Martin Short) who has lost most of his memory and pesters Jim continuously through the movie. They find a hiding place, with the help of B.E.N, to rest and knowing that if they try to leave they would be shot on sight.
But while Jim sneaks back to the Legacy to recover the map, their hiding place is invaded by Silver and his pirate crew. When Jim returns with the map, it is taken by Silver and Jim's determination forces Silver to bring him and the rest along to find Flint's treasure.
With the help of Jim, they find The Loot of a Thousand World's by a portal that was revealed by the map, used as a key. But while inside the middle of the planet where the loot is kept, the crew cross-over into a dangerous trap that was set by Flint.
The planet starts to destroy itself, Silver's crew race to escape while gaps open, fires rise up and the treasure starts sliding down into the planets fiery depths. Jim and Silver must figure out a way to escape the planet which is set to explode. But can anything convince Jim that Silver isn't as cold-hearted as he thinks, and Silver find that Jim is far more important then a loot?
This is a wonderful movie and is actually my favorite animated film. I shall this in theaters when I was but twelve, and even though the movie was a flop at the box office, only selling $110 million worldwide, it is still up there with the greatest.
When the film was released on DVD, it did do better and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but was downfallen by Spirited Away (an anime film).
If you want an animated movie with the adventures of science fiction, the charm of Disney and the background of piracy and treasure hunting, Treasure Planet is a definite watch. It has been a while since I shall an animated movie released (without the entire works of digital graphics) by Disney that has so captured my attention. Treasure Planet is for the whole family, and even grown-ups have enjoyed it.
So without further note, if you haven't seen this film do so immediately. For it shall be a while since another animated film will be released with such glamour and charm of Treasure Planet.",1235779200,3,4841,4.571921749136939
1487278,4,B00005JLR1,"overall, a fun story, well thought out characters.  The animation of CG combined with standard old fashioned cartoon-making, I think was seemless and very entertaining.  The same guys who gave us the excellent Little Mermaid put together a story of a Gen-X type character, in another galaxy where you can sail the stars, who has a wanderlust for travel and adventure -- who gets in trouble with the Robocops -- who makes unusual friends and the strangest alien people.

It's a very kid-friendly film.  Adults will associate this film with Disney's Peter Pan perhaps or even the Little Mermaid.  Though not as entertaining as these, it really hits off with melodrama (a bit much for me) and a lesson in pursuing dreams.

The DVD has tons of bonus features along with interviews with Roy Disney.  The problem I had with the features is that they chop the main features into tiny featurettes all in the same DVD, so when you think you're watching something new about the film, you see the same scenes again and again.  Example, watch Disney's Animation Magic, a good featurette, and then they slice the making of Silver out of that and place into the Disneypedia section.

Lots of info for kids on pirate history, what the flags mean, what types of ships they sailed and so on.  Even clips from the old 1940s pirate films, I noted a bit of Errol Flynn!!

Certainly no Pixar-fueled Wall-E, but definitely has the charm and wit of a Disney film.

1487421,5,B00005JLR1,"I am probably one of the few who did see ""Treasure Planet"" in the theater. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I think part of the problem with the poor showing at theaters, was that the movie, overall, was geared more towards teen males and adults (those who usually do not go to a theater to see a cartoon). The one liners in the film that reference other movies/shows like Star Trek and Star Wars are numerous, but you have to catch them. Casting was perfect. If possible, they should re-release the film in Disney 3D as was done with Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". This would be a prime movie to do that with, unless, due that it is a cartoon, the characters come across as flat. Eventually, I think this will be a Disney Classic.",1216425600,,747,4.45985401459854
1487422,4,B00005JLR1,"This, along with ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"", is surely being overshadowed by other more popular ones such as ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""The Incredibles"" and so on. ""Treasure Planet"" really is something worth watching.

Some of the finest things that are in this film are the animation. I'm floored by the visuals of outer space (rendered in both 2D and 3D). The supernova/black hole sequence is a sight to see. And the scenes in which Long John Silver demonstrates his Cyborg skills by cooking some stew and tracking his enemies down should be considered classic.

The music is also something to look forward to. James Newton Howard mixes a Celtic folk style with a typical Hollywood classical sound. I know it doesn't seem like a good combination, but Howard executes it so well.

As for the characters, it's a mixed reaction. The non-human characters like Doppler and Morph are well-drawn, but their personalities are aimed slightly towards the little kids. Long John Silver is brilliantly created, although he's nowhere near as good as Robert Louis Stevenson's own version. Captain Amelia is an attention-grabber: she looks lovely. Jim Hawkins has certainly gained a cult following in the recent years, and it shows. He's attractive, he's anti-heroic, and he's one of the great protagonists of all things Disney. B.E.N. is sadly an irritant. I was hoping that he would be much more like the orginal Ben Gunn, but I was disappointed. His screaming and his constant reminding that he's ""lost his mind"" is not enjoyable.

So with all the flaws aside, ""Treasure Planet"" is one of the underrated classics of the new millennium. And while it bombed in the box office, its cult following makes a point: the film will never die (and I mean that in a good way).

1487521,5,B00005JLR1,"Treasure Planet is by far one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. I'm so shocked it gets such bad reviews!

It's a classic story of adventure and coming-of-age, adapted from the novel ""Treasure Island"" by Robert Louis Stevenson. No, it is not a direct interpretation! But that's ok. The characters and the story are adapted from the novel to fit with the culture and imagination of today's world, and given a magical twist, as if 1800s England had special sci-fi technology.

In this version, Jim is a boy of fifteen whose father-angst has left him committing crimes and having trouble at home and at school, much to the pain of his young mother, Sarah. A chance meeting with old Billy Bones, former cabin-boy to the dreaded pirate Captain Flint, ends with him being given the map and key to Treasure Planet, a fabled place that contains the Loot of a Thousand Worlds, taken by Flint. This begins Jim's chance to set out on his own and learn about the world and who he is, and what potential he has.

The relationship between Silver and Jim is similar, but not exactly the same. It becomes a deep father/son relationship, with Jim finding in Silver what he always wanted from his deadbeat father. Silver is enigmatic, double-faced, and powerful, but grows a deep, unexpected soft spot for Jim that changes his mind about the treasure he's always sought.

Overall, I think the movie is fantastic. The animation is buttery smooth and is visually stunning, the characters are unique and interesting and all have a history long before the story takes place, and the adaptation from the original novel is very clever and updates the story well. The music, done by James Newton Howard and Johnny Rzeznik, is absolutely gorgeous, with a touch of Celtic influence added to the powerful orchestrations and themes.

1487638,5,B00005JLR1,"*** Spoiler Warning - this review might reveal surprises in the movie ***

First off for a frame of reference, I'm a 30-year old male and a sucker for Disney movies in general.

When this movie came and went to the theatres in a flash, I heard so much bad about it, how it was the worst Disney movie ever, that I actually didn't go see it in the theatre. I regret that now. First time I actually saw this movie was on a 14-hour flight from Los Angeles to London, and I fell heads over heels in love with it!

I adored the original Novel ""Treasure Island"", and I believe that Treasure Planet lives up to it. The central theme of Treasure Planet, in my mind, is the boy, Jim, who grows up with only a vague recollection of his father who in the movie appears like a shadow in Jim's faded childhood memories.

I think this particular ""flashback"" scene was very powerful, it featured the absolutely brilliant ""I'm still here"" track by Johnny Rzesnik, and led the viewer to fully understand Jim's childhood, and to share his teenage frustration and delinquency that stems from his father abandoning the young Jim and his mother. Possibly, I might a bit biased in this respect, since I can strongly identify with this situation as my own father was ""married to the sea"" when I grew up, and i can admit that i blubbered like a baby during the flashback sequence.

This is right in line with the core message of the film. A young, reckless and frustrated boy who is taken under the wing of the Old Salt, who becomes his new father figure. He learns how to take orders, work hard, grow, face adversity, and eventually become a man by making tough choices. An excellent message in this day and age, if you ask me.

I also loved the theme the producers chose. A type of anachronistic retro-futuristic design, where we in the future still use old, creaking, wooden, pirate ships, but with ultra futuristic systems. The movie also suspends the viewer from reality in many flavorful ways - for instance when the spaceship travels through the universe, it encounters a pod of whales. Or how Jim takes a dhingy ""comet surfing"".

I think this film provides excellent entertainment, suspense and has a great message for kids. But as an adult, I think I also got a kick out of this GREAT and CLEARLY UNDERRATED Disney flick.

1487640,4,B00005JLR1,"There's been many cinematic bombs over the years. Where it underperformed or just simply tanked and didn't even get close to meeting its budget, the film became one of 2 things: proof that audiences DO avoid bad films from time to time, or that it was simply mis-marketed and didn't reach the audience it should have. Treasure Planet I would say is the latter, a pretty good sci-fi tale that didn't see much box office.

Jim Hawkins is your care-free and wild teenager who gets into trouble and is sad about it but keeps doing it(kinda like me). However, someone crashes near his house and gives him a big golden ball: a map to the legendary treasure of Captain Flint, said to have pillaged treasure from a thousand worlds. He boards a ship with a steadfast captain, a socially awkward professor and an obvious threatening looking crew, in order to find the treasure.

One thing you can always expect from Disney is great animation and this film certainly has it. From the crescent moon shaped spaceport to an awesome scene involving a duel supernova/black hole, the film just looks great. The music's ok and we have a Tarzan idea repeated: have a singer do songs instead of the characters and this time we get Johnny Rzeznick(I don't know how it's spelled) of the Goo Goo Dolls which admittedly does some ok songs but they're completely out of place.

The film doesn't really have memorable characters except one: the captain Amelia which Emma Thompson voices, and I did like David Hyde Pearce as the professor. There's one character that is memorable but for the wrong reasons and that is the Jar Jar Binks of Disney: B.E.N, voiced by Martin Short. Just like Jar Jar singlehandedly ruined Episode I, B.E.N is just awful being irritating and useless.

Apparently the directors have been wanting to do this for a long time, but they had to do Aladdin and Hercules instead in order to prove themselves ""bankable"". It's odd though since we get a story that doesn't explain anything and characters aren't written that great. For instance, one character dies yet no emotional investment. And speaking of which, 18th century ships and architecture but characters can survive in wide open space? Fireballs hit the ship but characters can breathe? Um, ok.

I was expecting absolutely nothing great when I first watched this movie, but then the movie took off in the direction of greatness. The visuals were second to none, the voice-acting was great, and the plot and characters all hit their marks properly.

This movie bombards you with great designs. From the incredible designs of the captain, to the various space ships, you are constantly in awe at the creativity of the creators.

The characters all carried an emotional weight to them (the exception of course being the incredibly irritating CGI character B.E.N.) and delivered their lines in the most optimal way possible.

There is a lot of action and strange charatcters, and everything works out fine in the end for most of the ""good guys"".  There are some people who die, but actual death occurs off camera, so as not to be too upsetting for the children.

Get the same guys that produced previous hits like ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" and surely the result will be a winner.
Well, not entirely.
I went into the latest Walt Disney animated movie ""Treasure Planet"" really wanting to love it. I grew up just an hour away from Edinburgh and many times passed the island in the center of that city which, the tourist brochures tell us, served as an inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"".
The mesh of classic literature and science fiction does occasionally create a magical moment when you are left saying to yourself ""wow, now that was cool,"" but during too many instances in that movie theater I found myself wondering what I should pick up for dinner or, more telling, what this movie could have been, should have been.
It's novel to have the space ships in this production based on the design of the galleons that cruised the seas during Stevenson's time, complete with sails to capture the suns energy rather than the wind. It was interesting to see the character of Long John Silver turned into a cyborg with a shape shifter on his shoulder instead of a parrot.
The rogues galley of aliens and a robot that owes more than a casual nod to C-3PO also add color to this production, but it really is a mixed bag.
The story is so well known that it seems almost unnecessary to produce here. Young, adventurous and impetuous Jim Hawkins dreams of escaping the dreary life he leads and sailing the open sea, errr, I mean space. Then one night he rescues a dying traveler who has on his person a treasure map. Following his dreams he embarks on an adventure across the universe in search of untold wealth.

Of course when you watch a Disney-movie you have got to keep in mind that it's a childrens' movie (basically that is) - so to the reviewers who claims Treasure Island to be unrealistic, sorry, but haven't you perhaps missed a great point here? (I mean: ""What do they breathe?""!!)

Treasure Planet, yet another adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate and hidden plunder epic, could have been a chance for another entry into Disney's growing catalog of lackluster animated flims. Fortunately, it's really very good family film from the directors of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.

Putting an interplanetary spin on the treasure hunting tale was one of the best ideas in this film, and not only lends for some really interesting (and sometimes geniunely funn) twists on familiar story points and characters, but aslo for some geniunely spectacular scenery. The ships still resemble 17th century galleons, but are no retrofitted for space travel; plasma cannons and solar sails included.

Is it physically impossible? You betcha. Should you care? Not really. It's just too darn pretty. Like everything in this movie, the vehicles are imaginative, classy, and animated perfectly. The animation all around is some of the best offered from Disney, showing the late influences of anime as well as the more classic styles seen in movies decades old. And despite the near-schitzophrenic feel of some of the design-meldings, it all works beautifully on the screen.

The story is familiar, but some darker elements are added to freshen it up and give it some depth. Jim Hawkins (15) is a troubled youth with an absent father and a distressed mother. When a strange old pirate crashlands near his home with a cryptic warning and a map to a legendary treasure, it doesn't take much encouragement (in point of fact, it doesn't take any) for Jim to start his adventure. On board the RLS Legacy, he meets a suspicious motley crew, a high-strung feline captain, and John Silver, a cook and a cyborg who more than what he seems.

Jim's and Silver's relationship is played up in this version, and it's well-done. Silver is the substitute for Jim's father (who left 5 years previous), and the bond that forms between them is well-paced and believable. It's also strained during a mutiny, a frantic chase to Treasure Planet's surface, and a series of cat-and-mouse games involving the treasure map, the trove, and a thrilling escape.

Overall, Treasure Planet is really nothing terribly new, but it is very good. The care that was put into the art design, the touching up of the story, and the spot-on voice performances is evident in every scene, and through and through, the themes of family, never giving up, and bravery are relayed with pronouncement without every getting preachy. And there are parts that are just plain hilarious.

The extras on the DVD are better than usual for Disney. Along with a good and informative visual commentary track are deleted scenes, behind-the scenes looks at animation, and a few games for the kids. A music video and a great 1:85:1 transfer round out the package, making for a respectable DVD to go with a overlooked but highly entertaining film.",1101945600,5,3028,4.94488188976378

1487907,4,B00005JLR1,"I caught this on Disney Channel because, of course, no one saw it in the theatres. Watching it and then owning it, I both was surprised by its quality, and understood why it flopped.

First, the good points. The animation is spectacular. Sheer visual beauty. And, in this age of computer animation, this may be the high point and last hurrah of hand-drawn characters: incredible ""acting"" by the hand-drawn characters. The expressions and shifts of expression managed by pencil and eraser have to be seen to be believed.

Second, concept. This is the highest of high concepts, using a combination of eighteen-century elements and science-fiction technology in what must be described as pure mythology: it takes place in the impossible, a universe called ""the Aetherian"" where people can breathe in space-winds. It demands imagination and complete suspension of disbelief. The translation of Stevenson's classic to this mythological space is, simply, a treat.

Third, addressing the issue of parental abandonment and preoccupation and its effects on teenage rebellion. Everybody knows Disney heroes have only one parent. But this is the first time I remember that that's explained this way: ""Your father not the teaching sort?"" ""No, more the leaving and never coming back sort."" Set against this, and without the Stevenson characters of Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney to distract, the bond that grows between Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver becomes the centerpiece of the movie. It also leads to some incredible moments whenever these two legends clash. At one point I blurted out, ""He's going to kill him!""

So these are the things which I loved. I did not like the compression of time on the Planet itself; I thought the palette of color used for the pirates was literally overshadowed by the backgrounds -- who was coloring this, Don Bluth? B.E.N. was mostly only distracting, but I think that could have been remedied if the Planetside scenes weren't so time-compressed. And you've got to love a character that uses the name Lup in a sentence.

""I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)"" is my guilty pleasure song of the year. There's no one like John Rzeznik to capture the feelings of a rebellious and immature adolescent. Although, the chorus does invite you, if you can, to soar.

It should be clear by now why this movie tanked. The good points I list above doomed this movie. Because who the heck would watch this? It's too scary and too deep for young kids. It's too high-concept for most grownups. Its attempts at kid-friendly humor clash with the attempt at integrity of vision. It's too fantasy for sci-fi fans. It's too spacy for fairy-tale fans. It's got too much old-fashioned (""outdated"") hand-drawn animation for the cutting-edge CGI fans. It directly addresses the hearts of teenage boys who feel trapped and misunderstood: and what self-respecting rebellious kid is going to go see a Disney movie in the theatres?

The creatures are reminiscent of those seen in the bar of the first Star Wars movie. The action is what you'd expect if a movie were made of the Brooks' trilogy, the flights and fighting scenes with dangerous pitfalls.

This is Disney at its most superficial and cold.

Martin Short's malfunctioning robot must be one of the least funny of Dinsey's comic-relief characters. Rent LILO & STITCH instead if you have kids (or just rent it again).

The legendary loot of a thousand worlds inspires an intergalactic treasure hunt when fifteen year old Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) stumbles upon a map to the greatest pirate trove in the universe.  Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island Classic novel, the film follows Jim's fantastic journey across a parallel universe as a cabin boy aboard a space-galleon.  Blossoming under the guidance of the cyborg cook John Silver (Brian Murray), Jim and the alien crew battle supernovas, black holes and ferocious space storms on their quest for the gold, but none of this can compare to deadly dangers that lay ahead.
Review
One can't help but recall the surrealism of Yellow Submarine when watching this film, as the characters and even the concept of wooden Galleons with engines large enough to put the Millennium Falcon to shame fill a universe of oddly proportioned aliens and robots.  Indeed, ignoring the insanity of an open decked ship in the vacuum of space, one can't help but think the romance of a feline captain and a scientist with canine origins is a little more than disturbing.  Yet this is Disney, and all is pure and good when it comes to cross breeding of two species.
Seriously, Treasure Planet is an enjoyable romp through Stevenson's original classic, and while purists may have palpitations at the liberties that have been taken with the source material, the bottom line is that it is a thoroughly enjoyable family film.  Martin Short's portrayal of B.E.N., a robot with a short circuit, is hilarious and recalls memories of Robin Williams turn as the Genie in Aladdin.  David Hyde Pierce, making his second outing as a vocal talent in a Disney Film following A Bugs Life, is perfectly sardonic and draws knowingly from his successful performance as Niles in the TV sitcom Fraser.  While Levitt, who made himself famous through his portrayal of Tommy in Third Rock from the Sun, is refreshingly straight as the teenage hero Jim.
Its the roughness of the animation that in my opinion really lets this film down.  While it isn't bad by any standard, it doesn't have the flair of a Disney film, and near the introduction of Thompson's feline captain there are some glaringly obvious vocal-sync problems in matching the voice to the characters mouth.  Indeed, this just doesn't have the magic of a Disney theatrical release and will more likely become a popular home video classic, as it lacks the grandeur and set pieces of some of their better know products.
The Verdict
Treasure Planet is a good film that lacks something at its core.  It will make a great half term treat and adults will enjoy it as much as their children, but Disney needs to refill their salt shaker of Magic if this is all that they can muster.",1073433600,,2756,4.832271762208068

This movie's whole production design was so incredibly ass-backwards, it made my head spin. It's sad really, because the story is a damn good one, and this movie had a lot of potential. If those stoners at Disney had been spending less time taking acid trips to outer space, they would have done the reasonable thing: make realistic-looking spaceships and settings like in Titan A.E., and at least pay attention to whatever laws of physics you know about when you're sober. Instead, we get the most warped unreality ever seen on the big screen: There's breathable air in space, and the ship is rocket-powered, meaning that traditional sails would slow the ship down - so, of course, this ship keeps its sails unfurled at all times.

As with most Disney movies of late, it is not aimed at a preschooler crowd -- some younger kids may be o.k. with it, but parents should be prepared to watch it with them (some scary characters, lots of shot-'em-up action and swashbuckling, etc.).  Bottom line -- my kids liked it, and so did I.  It deals with a title character who has some problems; his dad abandoned the family, and he's trying to deal with his anger and prove himself.  It also deals with friendship, good vs. evil, and all the usual ""Disney formula for an animated film"" stuff.
It drives me crazy when so many reviews talk about the lack of plot line and character development...Hello!!!  This is a KIDS movie!  Kids like simple plot lines, characters that are clearly good or evil, and lots of repetition!  If you're looking for depth, an animated film made for kids may not be your best bet. :o)  True, some parts of the movie are annoying beyond belief (one word -- Morph), but reading three Dr. Suess books in a row drives me bonkers, and those are considered children's classics.

1488029,3,B00005JLR1,"For a host of reasons, ""Treasure Planet"" is sure to please the moppet audience for which it was intended. The art and animation is nothing short of sublime: the acme of the animator's art. The coloring is dazzling yet subtle. The conception of the ships is bold and original. The design of the characters - particularly Long John Silver, B.E.N., and Mr. Scroop - does not disappoint. The script (for the most part) is deft; the pace, brisk; and the voices of the characters matchlessly brought off.
So what's the problem with this movie?
Well, for the ADULT audience, at which many aspects of this movie are aimed, several hurdles come a-knockin', particularly when it comes to the way the plot stumbles storywise.
Lemme see if I understand: Dr. Dilbert Doppler is financing - exclusively commissioning - the entire ship with his ""savings"" (this is made clear). So how is it that his homeboy Jim gets stuck having to swab the decks and peel potatoes? The script tried to play this off as a whim on the part of our Protestant work-ethic captain, but for all that, it doesn't make a lick of sense and those upstairs knew it. I suppose Disney figured that, as I suggested, the kids in the audience wouldn't storm out of the movie-houses protesting the gross illogicality of this situation, since no sooner are we presented with it than we are introduced to the Cyborg's mesmerizing appendage. Just one of many irritating examples of how the barrel of their exposition could have used a cork or two. I had no problem believing that there were three-masted ships sailing through the ether and a dozen other ludicrous premises, but Jim's cabin-boy status posed a believability problem that nagged at me through a big chunk of the film.
And what's with Jim's pathetically trendy space-board? Is our age really so cynical that we can't simply make a movie that doesn't have a ""cool and rebellious"" hero at its center? Christ. Voltaire was ""cool and rebellious."" Jim (""prepubescent twit"") Hawkins isn't. In years to come this transparent attempt to connect with today's ""extreme generation"" is definitely going to date the movie in an embarrassing way. God forbid Disney remake Snow White! All the dwarves would probably be into body-piercing and bungee-jumping! Definitely one thing that's great about movies like Pinocchio and The Little Mermaid compared to this kind of film: in those older films there was never any attempt to cast the events and characters onscreen in the light of recent fads, hair-dos, etc. It was possible delightfully to lose oneself in the imaginative worlds presented without being rudely summoned back to the grimy modern world we all inhabit. Even so, I had nearly forgot about that idiotic board until the end of the movie, when it returns with a vengeance. Save your popcorn bag: you'll need it for the vomit.
And what's with Morph, the ubiquitously ingratiating sidekick? Sheesh. I mean, does Disney have such a low opinion of children today that it invariably assumes none of them will want to see a movie unless there's some impossibly adorable (and scrofulous, if you watch carefully) creature thrown in there? Am I asking too much?
(Well, at least the principals didn't break into a maudlin chorus every 5 minutes; this is something of an improvement over the traditional Disney fare. Although there are a couple of sappy songs - such as shortly after Jim meets Silver - mercifully, though, they aren't sung by the characters.)
A final thing that I found annoying with this movie (am I alone?) was that, in the end, NOBODY gets the treasure. I mean, I know the treasure's just series of nicely-drawn pictures, but at the end of the movie this gigantic mountain of gold and jewels is utterly destroyed and NOBODY gets it, not even the villain! I found this immensely irritating; the audience had definitely made an emotional investment in this treasure. Finding it was the whole point of everything, and when things simply don't pan out, we are left feeling cheated and unsatisfied. Couldn't the loot at least have gone to an orphanage or something? True, Jim was tossed a few coins, but then, in the idiotic finale, we see his mother has inexplicably used them to rebuild her inn (which, we are led to understand, had been on the point of giving her a coronary), rather than using them to go to graduate school, or build a better life for herself somehow. This, also, rubbed me the wrong way.
Yes, ""Treasure Planet"" is an irritating letdown in every way except visually. What is clear from the film's coloring, detail, and computer-aided graphics is that animated movies are right on the cusp of really growing up, really becoming serious vehicles for art and storytelling - at least potentially. But for some reason the studios that have the power to create meaningful animated films insist instead on infantilizing the media, wasting millions of dollars cranking out dreck so laughable that even the kids it's intended for see right through it.",1064448000,6,4974,4.8598351001177855

Anyone remember the little disaster in-a-box from 1996 ""Humpback?"" No well then count yourself blessed and spared by the divine hand of God  It was bad.
This movie was not bad, not at all in fact I rather enjoyed it.  The storyline was solid if not wholly original and the graphics were great, sorta reminded me of Titan A.E only this movie got me to laugh once in a while whereas Titan A.E didn't.  The voice actors also seemed to have a fun time with what they were doing.
The thing that killed this movie and why it so poorly at the box office was just the shear number of Treasure Island movies out there.  I'm sure that if this move had been a wholly orginal idea it would have been a box office smash, but unfortunately it was not.
If you have the opportunity to but this one go ahead and do it.  This movie will surly keep both you and the kids interested.  On the plus side for adults the annoying singing is kept to a minimum",1063843200,3,1126,4.233644859813084

1488183,4,B00005JLR1,"Though this movie has been out quite a while, I saw it for the first time last night after borrowing it from my wife's boss.
The story follows a young boy that was abandoned by his father at a young age, and became rebellious and arrogant as a teenager. He even has a ponytail, an earring, and a flying skateboard/hovercraft/wind surfboard! He is arrested by the robot police for skate/flying in a restricted area, and his mother is upset at him for ruining his future by getting into so much trouble.
A space ship crashes close to their house, and the owner of the ship gives the boy, Jim, a small sphere before he dies. The sphere turns out to be a map to Treasure Planet, a legendary planet that contains the plundered treasure of 1,000 worlds.
Jim saw this good fortune as a way to turn his life around and prove his worth to himself and everyone else, while also becoming terribly rich in the process. He set off with long-time family friend Doctor Doppler who used his life savings to commission a boat for the long trek across the galaxy to Treasure Planet.
The crew of the ship they end up on is rather questionable at best, and it is quickly apparent that they are not the friendliest bunch one could hope to be aboard a ship with. Regardless, Jim becomes friends with John Silver, the cook on the ship and eventually comes to see him as a surrogate father figure.
There are a few twists and turns in the plot, but you have to remember this is a Disney movie, so it's pretty easy to see them coming from about the first ten minutes of the movie.
Cliche'd storyline aside, I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. The animation is great, with a combination of impressive 3D renders for the backgrounds and environment, and hand-drawn 2d animation for the main characters.
The ""world"" of the movie is interesting as well, combining elements of the traditional pirate universe with space ships and cyborgs. This allows the artists quite a bit of freedom to come up with whatever they can think of, and makes for a visually rich movie.
The best part of the entire movie however was the little side-kick character Morph, who, in my opinion is quite possibly the cutest cartoon character ever. He's basically a pink blob that can float and morph into any object he wishes. He provides most of the comedic relief in the movie by morphing into objects and illustrating certain jokes. He generally brought a smile to my face every time he was on the screen.
Overall the movie was entertaining in a Disney Cartoon way, and as long as you don't watch it with the expectation of an engrossing and original storyline, I think you can find some enjoyment in it. Heck, I'd watch it again just to see Morph.",1059436800,,2704,4.531697341513293
1488184,2,B00005JLR1,"I bought this DVD mostly based on the other recommendations.  This is not a good film.  It isn't horrible, and it shares the universal appeal that all animation has for children, but there are better things to do with your time.
The animation is good, but not great.  A game like Final Fantasy displays more imagination when fusing sailing ships and space travel.  You certainly see why hand-drawn animation is being replaced by computer animation.
The plot is abysmally shallow.  The lead character was obviously designed by a committee, hoping to create someone with which today's teenagers could identify.  Most of the sidekicks were even more bland than the lead (was there any question how Morph would impact the story?  Did Martin Short's robot character contribute *anything*?).
I'm sure Disney consulted many focus groups to patch together this script.  I wish they had taken a chance with a more inspiring storyline.",1058140800,4,925,5.079470198675497

Treasure Planet, which I own on DVD, is a movie many people think of as sci-fi, at least those who haven't watched it. If they had, they would see this is no cheesy alien-attack video. Instead they would see a beautiful retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's masterpiece. This movie captured my heart.
Partially computer-generated, partially animated, Treasure Planet blew me away. Still true to the storyline of Treasure Island, it added humor and bits of story to the original tale, as well as blasting it off into space.
All in all, a very clever movie. I recommend you buy this and watch it as soon as possible. Hope to see you at the Montressor Spaceport!",1057881600,,873,4.56687898089172

The graphics looked really cool on the teaser, but the title was so weak that it wasn't enough to get me into the theatre. Well, I sure wish I would have seen it on the big screen! ""Treasure Planet"" is a feast for the eyes! The space shots, the ship, the whole interplanetary idea is really marvelous! And the story is incredibly moving, based on Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island."" The young hero, Jim, comes from a broken home, and wants to find his place in the world. Of course, like any young man, he's rebellious and has such great spirit, but he doesn't have a fatherly hand to guide him. When a space pirate crashes on his Mom's Inn and entrusts young Jim with a treasure map, the adventure begins! Jim and his tutor (a lovable, dog-faced creature voiced by David Hyde Pearce) book passage on the RLS, a gorgeous space-boat under the command of a feisty female captain (wonderfully voiced by Emma Thompson). Unbeknownest to Jim and the captain, the ship is actually being run by a mutinous gang of pirates lead by Long John Silver, a cyborg (part man, part machine). John Silver is masquerading as the cook, and he begrudgingly takes young Jim under his wing. A real friendship develops between these two, which is problematic for Silver's plans for taking over the ship and claiming the treasure on Treasure Planet for himself. Needless to say, this movie is based on a great story, and the furturistic retelling is truly splendid. I found myself moved from laughter to tears to complete awe at the splendor of the film.

1488445,5,B00005JLR1,"This movie is surprisingly faithful to the Robert Louis Stevenson classic; surprising because the movie takes place in outer space on multiple planets.  Because of the combination of anachronistic elements with interplanetary space travel, extremely high technology and space aliens, this movie comes across as fantasy versus science fiction.  The laser rifles look like flintlocks and the spaceship appears to be a sailing ship, complete with a ragtag crew right out of the original story, to name but a couple of examples.
Young Jim Hawkins rides a rocket-powered skateboard in feats that would turn the hair of anyone over the age of 30 gray instantly, which means that Jim's exploits are a sure hit for younger audiences.  As in the original, Jim is threatened by a variety of characters and situations and comes through each of them by a combination of luck, daring, and an affinity for Long John Silver as a father-figure.  Jim provides the center point for much of the action in this movie.
The story itself is the same as the original.  Jim Hawkins comes into possession of a treasure map, and he and other compatriots set course to find and retrieve the treasure.  Long John Silver has discovered what they plan to do and has gotten his men hired on to man the ship.  During the voyage Silver and his men take over the ship, and Jim Hawkins, the Captain and Doctor Doppler (comic relief, think Goofy as a professor) escape to Treasure Planet.  From this point forward the adventure is the encounters with the pirates, locating the treasure, and escaping back to home.
There are several points worthy of note.  The captain (Captain Amelia) is outstandingly animated and a unique combination of gymnast and intellectual, coolly commanding in all situations.  One of the best Disney-created characters ever; this DVD is worth having just to watch Captain Amelia.  Long John Silver is a cyborg.  Better to see Silver than any description I could provide.  The third point is that John Rzenik of the Goo Goo Dolls provided a song for the movie, in addition to James Newton Howard's score.  The fourth point is the incredible CGI backgrounds; these backgrounds bring an incredible depth and quality to the movie.
For fans of Disney's action movies, this movie is a must-have.  The story moves along briskly, and follows the original well.  The setting for the story is unique and well done, yielding a new Disney classic.  While the PG rating due to violence means that the movie is unsuitable for the very youngest members of the family, children over the age of five or six should find this movie a rousing adventure.  Five stars for this family movie.",1055721600,2,2657,4.866666666666666

This is an awesome adaption of the book Treasure Planet! If you even remotely liked the book (and even if you didn't like the book) you should thoroughly enjoy this movie! It is a story of a boy who sets out to find Treasure Planet--and along the way finds much more!

1488447,3,B00005JLR1,"It's always a gamble when you adapt a timeless classic like Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island.""  It's even especially dicey when you take the story out of its original setting and time. In this case, Walt Disney studios try to give the old swashbuckler a futuristic sci-fi spin in TREASURE PLANET, a film that partially succeeds in that task.  Set in a future time on a far off planet, the familiar story of heroic cabin-boy Jim Hawkins and the charming pirate Long John Silver is given the space ace treatment.  Instead of the one legged pirate we know, Long John is now a cyborg.  The Squire and Doctor characters who lead the treasure expedition are combined into one eccentric type (David Hyde-Pierce), while the ship's captain is a no nonsense feline voiced by Emma Thompson.  Finally, the castaway Ben Gunn is reimagined as a run-at-the mouth robot (Martin Short), who has lost his memory chip.  The animation is stunning and many of these characterizations work for the most part.  The one exception is the cyborg Silver.  Played with an Irish brogue and charm, I found it hard to really see this character as being totally capable of evil, as is his counterpart in the original book. Indeed, it's hard to take this softie seriously at times.  Part of the attraction of the Long John Silver creation is that he is a balance of good and evil.  He becomes a character we like, even as we loath his deeds.
Other than that, this film is suprisingly faithful to the book in the basic plot, and it deserved better than what the critics gave the film when it was first released.  Overall, this is a version that I would recommend, despite the fact that there are better adaptations and better portrayals of Long John Silver elsewhere.",1055289600,27,1742,4.697368421052632

This is a bizarro adaptation of Stevenson's Treasure Island.  It mixes futuristic sci-fi elements with 18th century props.  The idea of adapting Treasure Island into a set-in-the-future race to a Treasure Planet is a good one, but co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker's ill-conceived execution of this concept derails early on.  These guys missed the boat by light years by trying to force a pointless retro future look and numerous, tired Disney formulas into their vanity production.

""Treasure Planet"", while boasting some magnificent animation, doesn't hold the interest of those beyond the age of 10. It's almost like watching an offshoot of ""Titan, A.E"", taking place in a parallel timeline.

1488592,5,B00005JLR1,"This is one of the best animation films I have seen in a while (with the possible exceptions of Spirit & Shrek). Most of the main characters are unstereotypical, and come across as quite human (regardless of home planet). The saber-wielding, mutineering Long John isn't as evil as he tries to be. The indomitible Captain is incapacitated. The good Doctor gets to act the part of the hero. Jim's mother becomes quite frustrated with Jim's pre-adventure shenanigans. And Jim discovers that he isn't as worthless as he thought he was.
The storyline is simplified, of course, but the main elements of the book are still present. If you haven't read the book - or even if you have - take this film on its own merits. It stands as an excellent movie in and of itself.
My only complaint - if you want to call it that - is that some of the language used is far above a normal adolescent's vocabulary. The Captain, bless her heart, becomes extremely verbose at times.

I don't understand why this one did so badly out there, but I think it marks a return to form for Disney after the disappointing (to me) Atlantis.

Granted, the concept of old, tall sailing ships flying about in the vacuum of space is dubious at best, but it's an odd creative choice that settles in quickly as the strength of the amazing visuals sets in.  And that's just the beginning.  ""Treasure Planet"" quickly develops a well-plotted story that is not only characteristic of most (if not all) animated Disney movies, but holds up remarkably well to Robert Louis Stevenson's original ""Treasure Island.""  The characters are also surprisingly appealing, and the story of Jim Hawkins finding a sort of surrogate father in place of the dad he never had with John Silver, who, naturally, turns out to be the villain, provides a terrific and genuinely emotional character arc with which to anchor the rest of the story.  As with all good movies, ""Treasure Planet's"" abundance of excellent story and character arcs are coupled with a perfect, very nautically-themed score by James Newton Howard (who, by and by, provided an equally great score for the equally underrated ""Atlantis"").  All in all, this is a movie that comes together far better than audiences obviously expected it to based upon the awkwardness of the theatrical trailers.

The animation, a combination of traditional drawn animation and computer effects, was awesome. The music was beautiful, both the score and the two songs that were sung. The story, based closely on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, was intriguing. I could relate to Jim Hawkins's teenage rebel attitude. Captain Amelia, too, was extremely likeable, and a strong female character. B.E.N., the Bio-Electronic Navigator robot, got on my nerves after a while, but he was the movie's only flaw. Also included in the cast of characters is an adorable, pink, shapeshifting blob called ""Morph.""

1488725,3,B00005JLR1,"This movie lost 100 million dollars at the box office, an absolutely amazing feat.  Treasure Planet is pretty good for what it is, but i'm not sure why it was even made.  We all know the story and have seen previous versions hundreds of times.  There were no surprises at all in this movie.  Actually this movie was made in order to appease the two directors.  But at what cost?  Well the movie lost 100 million, all the artists lost their jobs and now Disney is hell bent on making only computer animated movies because they are convinced that the medium of a movie dictates how much a movie will make.
Treasure Planet was overall pretty bland and the first thirty minutes absolutey bored me to tears.  I hated the character design of Jim Hawkins and the character of Long John Silver and his relationship with Jim Hawkins was never particulary dynamic.  The directors said their mission in making this movie was to really focus on the relationship between Jim and John Silver but they didn't really get into it.  I think Disney is too concerned with keeping the story so quick and tight that they don't allow anything unique to happen.  It may have something to do with all the time they spend on story, or the tons of people contributing to the story, the lack of experience of the story people, or simply not thinking outside of the box.  I occasionally enjoy watching animation by Miyazaki because character relationships and mannerisms feel genuine and the story is more concerned with relationships and genuineness of character development.  DISNEY CARICATURES EVERYTHING.  In fact, they caricature caricature.  All reality and sincerity is completely gone by the time the movie is finished.
With Treasure Planet, except for the part where the song is playing, there was nothing particularly stirring.  It didn't have that magical, goose bump enducing quality like in Aladdin or The Lion King.  It was just ok.",1051574400,6,1917,4.81651376146789

I don't believe in comparison - comparing anime dubs to the original, the book to the movie - and the same goes for this. This cannot compare to 'Treasure Island,' and vice versa, not only for the fact that they aren't the same. Don't ever compare; it's like comparing apples and oranges and finding the orange better because it's orange. This is my disclaimer.
I love the plot, of course. The characters were incredibly lovable to me; I was guilty of finding myself completely charmed by John Silver's hearty chuckle; I giggled madly at Morph and his adorable nature; Captain Amelia just made me grin wickedly on the inside at her wit; I despised Scroop, as you're supposed to - I believed in his malice; I was proud of Jim, I felt for him; even BEN - probably the only part of the movie I wince a bit at - I think was cute and lovable in his own little robotic way. The animation is just beautiful; astounding, even. The effects and the work put into it is phenomenal.
I'm not entirely biased; I saw this movie fifteen times, and am namely obsessed, but I do see its flaws. And they are there. But I believe that if you're open-minded and can see its adorable Disney messages within this wonderfully put-together film, then it's a perfect recommendation. If Morph doesn't charm the pants off of you, the sight of Monstressor or Treasure Planet ... or the RLS Legacy ... will. This movie is spectacular - go get it. ^_^",1051574400,,1672,4.503289473684211
1488727,2,B00005JLR1,"I must admit that I bought into Disney's hype machine on Treasure Planet, and I wish I hadn't.  Treasure Planet is a pathetic movie.  Nothing is orginal at all, there's no character development.  It's like they took a bunch of ideas from previous kids movies and threw them into this mess.  The animation, which was one of the big reasons I wanted to see it, was nothing special at all.  I wouldn't waste anytime watching Treasure Planet.  Lastly, Treasure Planet didn't fail because of production fiascos, the reason it failed is that it's just not very good.",1051574400,4,560,4.721649484536083

7939808,5,B00005JLR1,Easily my favorite Disney movie. Unfortunatly it doesnt get the love it deserves because it came out at a time when a lot of people didn't watch what disney was making.
