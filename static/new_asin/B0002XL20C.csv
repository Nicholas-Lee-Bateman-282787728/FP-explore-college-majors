2136015,1,B0002XL20C,"OK, I am Romanian and I remember I read in Time magazine about the making of this movie in 2003. They called it an attempt to show the historical truth about Vlad Tepes?! Well, almost... The plot is cheap, but for a horror movie I'd say it is ok.... What amezed me  is that Romanian actors spoke English with a very strong Romanian accent but foreigners spoke Romanian with a very good accent. The chase scene made me smile because i recognized the part of Bucharest it was filmed and it is very dear to me... Now besides the fact that romanian soldiers in Vlad Tepes army looked like knights at King ARthur's court and that Vlad tepes's wife spoke some sort of old English?! and the movie depicted that the official religion was Catholic the rest is ok and I'd say they went the 9 yards to restaurate the costumes and habits. But... also one thing that made me smile.... the students arrive to one of Vlad tepes Castle at night and in the morning they leave from another one (in a different city). But only Romanians can recognize them.... Overall I'd say it is a cheesy movie for Romanians but it will fly with the rest of the world.",1123977600,11,1135,4.37914691943128
2136016,3,B0002XL20C,"For a low budget movie made in 23 days, ""Vlad"" is rather good. Apparently, director Michael Sellers was intent on making a serious film here as opposed to the usual slice and dice gore fests and has gotten respectable results. For the most part, the movie was filmed entirely on location using many local actors and actual villagers and includes dialogue in Romanian, Middle English, and Latin so it has an authentic feel to it. The atmosphere, settings, glimpses of Romanian culture, and flashbacks of Vlad the Impaler's life are fascinating. That the college students, who are there to research the ""historical"" Dracula, are fairly believable, particularly Monica Davidescu, is a welcome change from the bunglers in many ""horror"" movies. There are only a few ""supernatural"" scenes; Vlad in ""vampire face,"" which is something of a modified vampire bat face, a superimposed dual-image wolf-to-Vlad transformation, and a rapid ascent up the outside wall of a building so the story is not dependent upon or overshadowed by special effects. In one of the more realistic and intense portrayals of the title character to date, Francesco Quinn is quite compelling as Vlad Tepes/Dracula and mesmerizing to watch. Billy Zane, managing a credible accent, does a solid job as the students' contact/guide and the rest of the cast turn in decent performances all around. The bad news is that there is not enough of Vlad, the reason given for returning his necklace has a noticeable hole in it, and the girl sucked into our time, courtesy of said necklace, despite her costume, looks entirely too modern, which is distracting. In addition to the movie, there are many good extras and after watching all of them, it is worth the extra time to view Sellers' commentary to glean his noteworthy little tidbits about the filming. The only annoying part of these remarks is that he mentions too often how long everything took to do. All in all, ""Vlad"" is an enjoyable, worthwhile addition to any vampire movie library.",1122336000,7,1999,4.9880239520958085
2136017,5,B0002XL20C,"This movie was great, and I am finally very happy to watch a movie that had actually facts about Vlad Tepes Drakula.  Finally a movie that uses some of the Romanian language.  I liked it very much like any other Dracula films.  There was a lot of history.  So if you like the real Vlad then you will like this movie.  The movie was dark, but it set the mood and it was acutuall made in Romania.  FINALLY!  I love it and so did my friend.",1120867200,4,437,4.011627906976744

2136019,5,B0002XL20C,"I was lucky enough to catch this film at a screening in Los Angeles and enjoyed it immensely. What I liked most was the way the film blends all the classic elements in a traditional vampire film, but remains unique in its approach. Rather than relying on blood and gore, it portrays Vlad the Impaler as more than a monster. We're shown glimpses of his past and quickly empathize with his pain, even as we're terrified by his brutality.

The love stories woven into the film and the pace at which it's told keep you emotionally invested and on the edge of your seat. The tone and feel of romance, aided by the beautiful backdrop of the Carpathian mountains, is undeniable and moving.

The film carefully balances love and anguish while merging past and present worlds. Even though it's set in modern day, the film shows how we as people face the same struggles throughout our history. Vlad is incredibly well thought out and acted, and should be enjoyable to a wide range of people. The nudity and violence in the film is done with taste and purpose and I'd recommend this film to anyone that wants a romantic saga about one of the world's most notorious monsters.

2136030,4,B0002XL20C,"This was a DVD I'd seen before but wanted my own copy.  It's a bit of a different story of Vlad the Impaler with more historical detail.  The beginning, in Romanian with English subtitles is especially good.  Has a good cast of well-knowns...Billy Zane, Brad Dourif, etc.  The second film I've seen Francisco Quinn in and am wondering now why there haven't more.  An entertaining and slightly off-beat tale of the man who became Dracula.",1308787200,,437,4.773333333333333
2136031,4,B0002XL20C,"I knew entering this movie I wasn't to expect much. I wasn't expecting an over the top performance from the actors and I knew it was put together with a low budget. I don't know what most people expect when they purchase a low budget b movie. The acting is bad and there usually is some cheesy sets or terrible use of cgi. I personally love B movies and enjoy them. They don't have to be perfect and they remind me of when I was a kid renting low budget horror movies. Vlad is your typical B horror movie. Supernatural bad guy who is a demon vampire killing endlessly and a rip off to friday the thirteenth. I thought it was funny that Vlad came out of a dream as did a beautiful damsel in distress. If your in to vampire movies this is not your typical vampire movie. Vlad also know as Dracula tries to mix fact with fiction for entertainment purposes. I thought Vlad seemed more like a demon than a vampire and he just killed people instead of turning them into vampires. Vlad also is a playboy who seems to get every actress in bed with him before the movie ends. If your looking for a 80's type B movie look no further this is a good little film, But be warned this type of movie is for B horror movies fans. I know there are a lot of people who don't like low budget movies. So if you want oscar worthy performances and stories that are complex stay away. If your like me and love low budget horror with endless killings, beautiful women, sex, violence, and a awsome castle in the woods. You will enjoy this movie as I have.",1295308800,,1529,4.204081632653061
2136032,1,B0002XL20C,"I'll put it plain and simple, CRAP!!! These people should stop coming up with their own story line this a piece of you know what. Director's Cut, they should have kept on cutting.",1254700800,,179,4.454545454545454
2136033,2,B0002XL20C,"I have always been a fan of vlad dracula, and having a boyfriend from Romania, I guess I now have to, for he is a national hero.  This movie was a dissapointment.  We rented it thinking were going to get something with substance but were wrong.  Yes it does state some facts about Vlad, but mostly it was fictional. But I have to say I did enjoy the native speakers of the language, they didn't butcher the accent like the Van Helsing movie.

If you are looking to see a movie with historical facts I would suggest, Dacula: Dark Prince, thought it doesn't get everything right it is much closer then this moive.  Also a great book packed with facts about Vlad, his homeland, and his history is Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times by McNally, Radu Florescu, and McNally Raymond. Radu Florescu has other books on Vlad. I would have to say the most intersting part of the entire movie was the first 5mins and then extras where you get to see the castle that vlad was imprisoned in and a Romanian Villge. Vlad was an interesting man, far more then the fictional Dracula that was modeled after him.",1159056000,,1111,4.426470588235294
2136034,3,B0002XL20C,"This was a very interesting movie about Vlad Dracula, not especially about vampires.  It tried to tell a bit of history about Vlad and his origin and rise to power, and it wasn't just a cheaply made movie to show off a bunch of women getting naked and getting their necks bitten. It's actually about 4 exchange student ""chosen"" to come to Romania to study the history of the country by traveling to the Carpatian mountains to research the home Territory of Vlad the Impailer.  But, one of them has a secret, an necklace that was worn by Vlad himself, taken off of him in his grave.  Now, the movie gets strange because it is not based around getting the necklace back, but about getting this midevil English girl that has been brought through time just before Vlad was going to Kill her (or marry her, not really sure).  She was warped through time by the power of the amulet.  After she comes back, so Follows Vlad because she reminds him of his dead wife.  The rest of the movie is the students trying to get this necklace back to the tomb so VLad will rest in peace.

  I could explain more, but Its difficult.  I found myself at many points wonder, why doesn't Vlad just take the dang english girl and leave, he wanders into the castle right by her (followed her scent) and attacks all the friend, and yet doesn't just walk up, take the girl and leave?.  Or, if he's mad about the Necklace, why doesn't he just take it from the guy?  I am not sure. Finally, as one of the other astute reviewer notes, at the end scene, One of the female student who is controlled by Vlad, attacks the friend attempting to put the necklace in the stream and back on the stone, then turns her attention to english girl who jumps on her back.  Finally, this Vlad controlled student gets the upper hand on the English chick, and calmly stand by in awe as the first friend completes the task of replaceing the necklace.  Why doesn't she snap the english gals neck and stop the gal with the necklace, or why doesn't vlad turn and stop her? Instead he is just merely swinging his sword attempting to kill the friend without the amulet?  Just really confusing. The movie was entertaining enough, but could have been so much more.  It just Kinda flaked out at the end.  Again, at times i think they did throw in some nudity scenes just to capture male viewership. Their was a dream scene in the bathtub, could have been done in bed or any other time just as well, but eh, that's what B movies do. Also, they had to throw in a steaming animalistic love scene, again, B movie nescessity?  So, worth seeing, just try and ignore the few script errors, and it really could have been a big film if it had been funded better.",1154044800,12,2696,4.3687374749499
2136035,1,B0002XL20C,"There are others who say that Billy Zane's acting makes this movie worth seeing in a minor degree. It is true that Billy Zane has some certain qualities, but nothing could possibly make this movie worth seeing. Not even the brief and repeated nudity of one of its attractive female leads.

Normally I only take the time to write a review if I really like something, but this movie insults me on every level possible. By all rights, it should not exist. None of it made any sense, and if it had it probably would only have made it worse. The music, writing, dialogue, plot, special effects, cinematography, just everything was an absolute nightmare. It seems like when they were making it, they couldn't decide whether it was historical fiction, horror, or God knows what else. I suppose they didn't have to, because it fails on absolutely every level. Every turn in the plot seems the whim of a mildly-retarded toddler. Every line of dialogue seems pointless, as does every event from start to finish. Everything seems overly long, there is a weed smoking scene that absolutely has nothing to do with the movie and drags on forever, there is a fantastical sex scene that happens for no reason and drags on forever, there are numerous and pointless hints of lesbianity of one of the lead characters. I'm hard pressed to look at the screen at all to find all of the things to warn you about.

I could go on, but this movie was so bad that any more writing would be an absolute waste of time and an affront to humanity. Do not watch it, do not rent it, do not buy it, do not justify any part of it, for the love of God can't anyone realize that this sort of blundering stupidity is what is wrong with the world today?!?!

To sum it all up, Billy Zane must have REALLY needed 50$. 0 stars, 1 because there is no 0. I couldn't have made a worse movie if I tried.",1149206400,3,1857,4.392441860465116
2136036,2,B0002XL20C,"The only really interesting thing about this movie were the flashbacks. If they had focused on that, instead of trekking through the woods, it would have been a much better movie. ANd I must have missed the point of this as I watched alot of the movie in fastforward, but what was Vlads purpose in taking and having sex with the one modern day blonde, and then going after the past blonde? Or is this another of those movies where sex and nudity has to be thrown in just because? I was really disapointed in what I thought would be an interesting movie rental.",1142899200,2,560,4.394230769230769
2136037,2,B0002XL20C,"OK... it almost kills me to give a 2 star rating to a BILLY ZANE movie!!! Zane gives a Great performance in this film and does a great job with his Romanian accent! This is the reason for the 2 star rating and Zane was the only reason I have this movie. Otherwise, the moving is rather boring and a dracula want to be flick. Not a true vampire movie. I'd only suggest renting this film to see Zane's performance....other than that, I think most people will be disappointed in the overall film.",1141603200,,493,4.311827956989247
2136038,1,B0002XL20C,"The transylvania accents sound really phoney; so much so it was almost laughable.  The whole story and variations of the theme of the dracula fiction was also absurb. The main theme is some stupid amulet. I just didn't like the movie. The story is too far absurb, and I didn't like the fusion between the old world and the new-all through the amulet ""breaking the wall of time"" It was like mixing two separate themes which totally clashed.",1133654400,3,439,4.628205128205129
2136039,5,B0002XL20C,"I was pleasantly surprised with this film... definitely not your average vampire yarn.  Let's face it,... all horror movies are are a little hoaky, but you ignore it to get the thrill! This one starts off with a flashback to the time of Vlad the Impaler, with a narration by John Rhys Davies (Classy).  You get a little history lesson on the real Vlad Tepes Dracula.  You see him as victim of deceit, betrayal, and violence.  You begin to understand how he would like some revenge... Bigtime!  This puts a human face on the old Dracula story.  The photography (filmed in Romania) is First Class, and the Musical score... even better.  This has the look and feel of a very expensive, big studio production, although as an indy it probably had a short budget.  Shows you what you can do when you have real talent.  The chicks are hot too! One, a sharp Romanian actress,... the other, a blonde bombshell (Cam Heskin) from ""Catch me if you can"".  They both did a great job in this film... and their roles were not just T&A fluff.  The real stand-out, tho, was Francesco Quinn (Anthony Quinn's son)... He did a fantastic job in the role of Vlad.  He was artistic and chilling at the same time. Look for big things from this guy.  Billy Zane.... (could have played the Vlad role) has a rather incidental part to play.  He's convincing in the role, but gets done in quickly. The plot pivots around an ancient amulet or necklace which belonged to Vlad, and was buried with him.. One of the Characters has the Amulet, and wants to return it to Vlad's tomb (it was stolen by the germans during the  war).  But guess what?... As the amulet is brought closer to Vlad's castle, Vlad returns from the past, and unlives again! The rest of the movie is a contest between some graduate students and a vampire.  He wants to stay in the present, and they want to send him back.  By the way,... there's also some pretty hot sex scenes along the way. I won't give away the ending, but will just say see the movie. I did, and I was glad I did.",1133308800,5,2021,4.401617250673854

Good movie overall, the ending was a bit simple though compared to the rest of the film.  Incredibly interesting though and a fair amount of good information about Vlad Tepes, whom i've always been a little facinated with.  Good acting all around even on Billy Zane's behalf (im not the biggest fan of his work) and quite a few beautiful women to keep the film mature.

Historically accurate Vampire movies = Better

ok so im sure its not totally historical but it does give a little background and history about Vlad Tepes (Dracula) which I find to be very interesting.  All in all the storyline was interesting, acting was good and it was filmed quite well.  The only con I can think of was Billy Zane..  seriously, I think as an actor you really need to learn your role including the language that they would speak (at least a little) lol.. Billy Zane is a good actor though and played the part quite well.  Very good film I would say!",1130457600,,591,4.425925925925926

While this movie was meant to be exciting fiction, it did indeed present quite a bit of factual history about Vlad The Impaler.. It goes into the history of Vlad and how the concept of Dracula may have been connected with Vlad Tepes.  Quite an interesting premise to follow.  Acting, filming, storyline are all good and it is definitely worthwhile.",1129680000,2,551,4.372549019607843
2136055,3,B0002XL20C,"For a modern Dracula movie, this one isn't bad. The only bad thing is that it barrows and copies from many other Dracula stories and movies, including Subspecies and Bram Stoker's Dracula to name a couple.

Over all, the movie isn't bad. The special effects are decent and the story, is once again, average. The acting is good in places, but two of the best actors, and the one's I watched the movie hoping to see - Brad Douriff and Billy Zane - were barely in the movie at all. I was disappointed.

There wasn't anything that stood out for me about this film, other than the fact that Billy Zane is still charming as ever. Other than that, the plot is full of holes, the ending is silly, the story is predictable. I also had objections to a rape scene in the movie. There are good parts. Some of the costumes are nice, and some of the acting was decent.

I would recommend this only to fans of B movies, people who need an all too brief Billy Zane fix, or Dracula completist fans. I would not recommend it to someone just looking for a good horror movie.",1129680000,3,1055,4.291457286432161

Out of the many generic Vampire titles out there I think this is one of the most original.. I really enjoyed the twist they put on it with the time traveling and how well it was shot in general.

2136059,2,B0002XL20C,"Imagine that you are in Dracula's tomb, and that you hold in your hands they key to his death. It is a necklace, and for some obscure and inexplicable reason it needs to be dipped into the bottom of a tiny bubbling waterfall that - again - for some obscure and inexplicable reason is in the tomb itself. Though you're in Dracula's tomb, he's not dead. Well, of course he is dead, but not ""dead-dead"". He's quite animate, and he's in the tomb with you, trying to keep you from dipping the necklace in the bubbling pond and then placing it on a rock. Yes - that's right. Dip the necklace in the pond and place it on a rock. That's what you need to do to kill him.

Absurd enough, correct?

Now imagine that the necklace is knocked out of your hands, and while your friends are keeping Dracula at bay (actually, just your boyfriend, everyone else is kind of looking around) you scramble for the necklace. One of your friends, who has been tainted by Dracula, jumps on you to keep you from getting to the necklace. Another friend, who - inexplicably - has been brought forward from the past into this period (and who performs no particular function whatsoever, other than perhaps to illustrate a rather foolish time concept - which is simply that time is nothing...uh, duh?), jumps on the tainted one and pulls her off. You grab the necklace, and while you're doing this, the tainted one, instead of continuing to assail you, holds on to the forward-in-time friend and watches you with the silly look that vampires have. The tongue lolling, wide-eyed mien that says to all: ""I'm a blood thirsty fool without a brain of my own. Without my leader, I would be lost."" What a sorry lot vampires are.

So now you have the necklace! This is magnificent! Now you can dip the necklace in the bubbly water, lay it on the stone, and kill Dracula!

But wait! Dracula is still in the room. If the tainted one won't help him, surely he will help himself?

Given what I've said already, I think that's a question with an easy answer.

While I'm leaving out the very end of the film, a sequence that should have caused tender emotion but instead caused me to laugh, this is the climax. It's a complete mess of logic, as is everything that preceded it.

Seeing this brought to mind: That's right - Bill Zane is still acting. What in the world happened to his career?

Feeling very much like the slew of nonsense that presently exudes from the once-great Full Moon Pictures (but without any of the campiness that keeps FMP mildly interesting), this movie is a cumbersome hodge-podge of dreadful acting, dreadfully trite dialogue that probably sounded poetic in the writer's head, and a plot so confusing and plodding that I was barely able to keep my attention on this movie.

First of all, this movie starts off with a fairly accurate (albeit brief) account of Dracula's rise to power, and sets this story up in a very ""DaVinci Code"" sort of way. There is a secret order looking for an artifact of Dracula's and some student has it and they try to keep track of her to get it back. Only there seems to be warring factions, or perhaps a whole other secret group, also looking for the relic and they have a couple pointless battles with a less-than-enthusiastic Billy Zane. Douriff tries to approach his 3 minutes of screen time as the stately overseer of the good guys, but comes across as someone trying to get through his scenes so he can collect the $50 they promised him for this cameo.

Then, the relic, an amulet, turns out to have magic powers that, at first, only cause nightmares and historically accurate flashbacks for the main characters (whoever they were...soooo forgetable), but then it inexplicably can open a portal through space and time but only for a random blonde chick and Dracula himself. Later, some priest shows up (from where, I have no clue) and he exhibits magical powers for about 5 seconds (why, I don't know) and then Dracula offs him and we move on. As you can tell, this film completely lost me by the end.

Dracula himself might have been an okay b-film character if the writer could have picked a version to stick with. Is he an historical figure? Is he a vampire? Is he someone who just travelled through time but somehow is now a living corpse with super-powers and a randomly shape-shifting face? I couldn't tell you. It made no sense how the time portal brought the blonde girl through time without changing her at all, but Dracula (supposedly a regular person from history) is now described as having ""elastic, cold skin"" or something like that and he is a monster. Are they saying Dracula was really a monster? This brings up another problem I had which is that one of the 4 main characters is supposedly a Transylvanian local but is perfectly fine with the whole Dracula-is-a-vampire thing, which goes against everything about Romanian culture. They don't actually buy into the vampire stuff, though they will sell it to tourists (and bad filmmakers, clearly).

Too many things were attempted with this movie and none of them worked. The characters react to the sudden appearance of monsters and time travelers as if these were totally acceptable changes to their lives. They have an initial look of shock and then they just continue on as if nothing weird just happened. I suppose we, the viewers, are supposed to have the same tacit acceptance of this plot. Personally, I can't do that. My willing suspension of disbelief only goes so far.

Finally, a couple notes about the DVD itself. It looks great on the outside, but the menus are clearly bottom-budget templates. The aspect ratio claims to be widescreen, but it only fills a widescreen tv if you zoom into it. Otherwise, the picture has black bars on all four sides of the frame. I found that unacceptable. Zooming makes the picture blurry and dull, even on an upscaling player and HD display.

I have never done this before, but I threw my copy in the trash the second I pulled it from my player. I'll consider the financial loss a stupidity tax for my blind purchase of such a dreadul movie.",1371427200,3,4209,4.626506024096385
