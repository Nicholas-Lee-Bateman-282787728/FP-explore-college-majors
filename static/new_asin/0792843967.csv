149487,3,0792843967,"Have you ever watched a film from the 1970's and looked at the special effects and thought ""Gee, they were using these same scraping the bottom effects twenty years ago in the fifties and they weren't all that impressive then!""  Well, this was the third in a series of Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptions and the sequel to 1975's the Land that time forgot. The Dinosaurs are done with handpuppets, guys in rubber suits and pulled along on strings and wheels. The cavepeople (except for Dana Gillespie) wear greasepaint and many of them wear latex pieces between the bridge of their noses and their foreheads, I guess that was to give their cranium such a different shape from the modern characters. Making the realization that this film was made the same year as Star Wars also makes one grimace a little more at the effects.  If this film has these visual shortcomings, why then did I give it three stars? I think director Kevin Connor (who has done a whole lot of films since this time) realized that this was going to be a kids movie, so he kept the science and explanations ata minimum and kept the characters moving through the film. The key here was pacing and the stars are running a track meet here, searching, chasing and fighting, but never stopping too long for the budget's flaws to catch up to it. Fight scenes and explosions can go along way and this film has plenty of both.  Not a classic, but still a fun film fro all ages. This one is just a little better than the Land that time forgot, but not quite as good as At the earth's core.",980812800,5,1546,4.455830388692579

149573,3,0792843967,"This review is for the Blu-Ray release of 'The People That Time Forgot' released by Kino-Lorber in May, 2016.

This movie gets 3 stars because the poor plot and production are balanced out by the very good blu-ray and extra's.

BLU-RAY: The blu-ray disc is clean and crisp. I don't have much to say other than it looks good! If you are a fan of the Edgar Rice Burrough's trilogy from the 70's then this is the version to have. If only they would combine movies into a double feature like they did with MGM's Midnite Movies.

EXTRA'S: There is a good audio commentary track by the Derector Kevin Connor. There are brand new interviews by two of the stars, Sarah Douglas and Dana Gillespie. The interviews are very good and informative and what I feel is the best part of the extra's. They are so new that Sarah Douglas refers to David Bowie's death that was just a few months ago. What makes the interviews interesting is that they are not coordinated or in the same place and the two female stars make references to a lot of the same stuff which allows you to confirm the accuracy of the information. Sarah and Dana both talk about how they became good friends and everybody had a blast making the movie with Doug McClure. They also competed for the same role in this movie just as they did in 'Superman' which Sarah Douglas ended up getting. It was quite amusing to listen to Dana Gillespie refer multiple times to her cleavage and makes no attempt to diminish the fact that that was why she got the part. Apparently Dana is a musical artist which she continues today. She obviously looks much different today (I'm being kind!). But hey at least she had it once and she knows it. She jokes about the fact that David Prowse would not have been able to lift her over his head if she weighed what she did today. Sarah Douglas talks a lot about how enthralled she was with Doug McClure (makes me wonder what went on in the evenings).
Lastly, you get the trailer.

PRODUCTION: The People That Time Forgot was mostly shot on an island of of Spain. It is a good location as it appears to be a volcanic island. At first I thought it was filmed in Hawaii. It was made by England's Amicus Productions, remembered as a competitor of sort to Hammer Films.
In her interview, Sarah Douglas makes light of the fact that when she got the part in this movie that she thought it was a major Hollywood production, especially since Doug McClure was starring. She says the McClure was a major star at the time and that everybody knew him. She says his role in 'The Virginian' brought him worldwide fame. I myself have never seen the show and am just a bit too young to have seen it. I don't really remember seeing it in syndication. Of course there was Patrick Wayne, the son of John Wayne, so she believed it be a big production. It was only later that she found out it was a lesser production. We learn from Sarah Douglas in her interview that Thorley Walters brought his own toilet paper! David Prowse has a minor role in this movie and plays his usual type of role. Soon after he would don the costume of Darth Vader. Though Doug McClure is a star in all three Edgar Rice Burrough's movies of the 70's he takes somewhat of a back seat in this movie to the other stars. He doesn't appear until the second half of the movie.

PLOT/SUMMARY: This movie picks up where 'The Land That Time Forgot' left off. The 'message in a bottle' is discovered and Bowen Tyler's (Doug McClure) friend Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne) organizes and expedition to Antarctica to look for the lost island of Caprona where Tyler is supposedly residing. Once their ship arrives at the 'lost' island they launch a amphibious airplane over the mountain wall. The crew consists of McBride, Norfolk (Thorley Walters), the paleontologist, mechanic and pilot, Hogan (Shane Rimmer), and Lady Charlotte (Sarah Douglas) Supposedly Caprona is 200 miles long. Once over the wall their communications become hazy and they are promptly attacked by a pterodactyl which is killed when it smacks into the propeller. Unfortunately for the crew, this damages the airplane and they are forced into an emergency landing. From here the crew is forced to take off on foot with the pilot staying behind to make repairs. Not long after they take off, they meet up with Ajor (Dana Gillespie) a prehistoric girl who happens to speak English! Apparently she was the 'friend' (wink wink) of Bowen and they have been separated due to unfortunate circumstance. They learn that Bowen was last seen being taken by the bad guys. From here they go in search of Bowen.

THOUGHTS: I watched this movie about 3 years ago for the first time since I was a kid and didn't think much of it at the time. I thought it was easily the worst of the 3 Edgar Rice Burrough's movies. Upon watching it again, my opinion has changed. It wasn't as bad as I had remembered and while I still think it is a lesser effort than 'At the Earth's Core,' it's not far off. 'The Land that Time Forgot' is easily the best of the three.
I felt that 'People' was a bit inconsistent with 'Land.' Especially the 'people' themselves. The group that captures McClure is nothing like the prehistoric people that gradually age from the previous movie. Also, the title is a bit misleading. The 'people' of the title are not that much more important than any of the other movies and really this could have just as easily been called The Land that Time Forgot 2.
Ultimately, it's just not that good of a movie and Doug McClure is underused. The whole point of the movie was the rescue attempt and by the end of the movie it feels like it was all so pointless.
I felt that the skull mountainside fortress looks extremely phony and probably the worst of the special effects in the movie. Blu-Ray quality only exaggerates the problem. The pterodactyl didn't look all that great either and for that matter none of the dinosaurs looked good!
The chase seen at the end looked just ridiculous. I'm not sure how far they were running but it looked like they had to run a weeks worth of travelling in a few minutes. The eruption effects with the color smoke looked just so out of place. It was more like a fireworks block party. Why does every science fiction movie that takes place on an island have to end with a volcanic eruption? You'd figure by the mid 70's that this plot device had long ago been played out.
On the positive side you do get lots of sweaty, shiny cleavage!

As always, I'm happy to at least have a blu-ray of an older science-fiction movie. Thanks to Kino-Lorber.

4 1/2 stars for the blu-ray release and extra's and 1 1/2 stars for the plot and production. Average - 3 stars.

149577,5,0792843967,"Ok, ""Land that time forgot"" was better and this was really a letdown, where they seemed to use the leftover props such as the costumes of the  natives from the first installment . Nothing about the evolutionary.mystery of the Island that Bowen Tyler could have spoken about as far as he had learned.  Lisa conveniently dead and the fat guy boss knowing no English while all his minions did learn from Bowen. They name drop the Galu and Naga we learned about in the first movie. Just eat your popcorn, drink your coke and accept it for what it is. A 70s B movie of the day. Its a good afternoon time spender.

I gave it five stars only because I was impressed by the amazing quality of the BluRay. Kino Lorber did a good job.

149613,4,0792843967,"***This review may contain spoilers.***
Its easy to pick on and ridicule the movie The People That Time Forgot (hereafter PTF), based on Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughss prehistoric fantasy tale.  Most of the other Amazon posters here have detailed the clunky special effects and matte painting backgrounds, anachronistic features such as Hun-like barbarians with horses (!) in a secluded tropical land within frozen Antarctica (maybe it had thermal springs), buxom Narga cavewoman Ajor (Dana Gillespie) with flawless makeup and hair, and both barbarians and the primitive Narga tribe speaking fluent if stilted English (although PTF explains this miracle by stating that Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) instructed both factions how to speak English.)

Tyler was the explorer in PTFs predecessor movie The Land That Time Forgot left behind in the savage land (called Caprona) by the rest of his team.  PTF chronicles the efforts of a new team to locate and rescue Tyler from Caprona.  The leader is Ken-Doll handsome and resolute Major Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne) with his brown Superman hair-curl.  Piloting the rickety bi-plane that flies them over the icy Antarctic mountains to Caprona is boozy gunner and mechanic Hogan (Shane Rimmer), who also provides slapsticky comic relief.  Financing the rescue expedition is comely, somewhat haughty, but game photographer Lady Charlotte Charlie Cunningham (Sarah Douglas) with her aviatrix get-up and mini Princess Leia do.  Last but certainly not least important is knowledgeable paleontologist and scholar Norfolk (Thorley Walters), eager to explore Capronas ancient fauna. After some convincing, the suspicious Ajor agrees to lead them to Tyler. Can McBrides team locate Tyler?  Even if they do, can they bring him and themselves- back to civilization alive?

I don't completely disagree with Amazons PTF detractors and the aforementioned flaws they point out.  Nevertheless, I found PTF more than reasonably entertaining and involving because all the characters act more or less logically and rationality and yet display personal shortcomings without looking buffoonish, yes, even Hogan.  The action and the prehistoric creature/human encounters are well-planned, suspenseful, tense, and meaningful, because you care about these people and their mission.  The fiery human sacrifice ritual and volcanic explosion climax is also stirring.  PTF at heart may be an improbable pulp jungle tale, but its a surprisingly serious and well-told one.

Two other PTF features are especially notable.  First is the positive portrayal of Norfolk.  Unlike other academicians, professors, and scholars who are smart but lack physical power and courage in a dangerous situation, Norfolk is no wimp.  With his sword/stick concealed within an umbrella handle, Norfolk can fight and defend himself and others with the best of them, even while still obsessed with preserving his notes.  Second is the actual, if imperfect, portrayal of real prehistoric dinosaurs and reptiles.  Everyone recognizes the stegosaurus, the carnivorous ceratosaurus, and perhaps the pterodacyl that attempts to sideswipe the bi-plane.  However, few of us may recognize that the giant lizard menacing our tied-up heroes sprawled on the ground is known as a Megalania, a ferocious Komodo Dragon-like 20-foot lizard that lived in Australia more than 2 million years ago.  Even fewer of us would know that the huge armored lizard attacking our heroes in the cave is known as a scutellosaurus, a 10-foot long herbivorous lizard that actually predates the dinosaurs by hundreds of millions of years and is considered the ancestor of the turtle.  I just happened to know this because Im a prehistoric animal geek.  I appreciated that PTF took the time to re-create these creatures fairly accurately, even though they looked a little ungainly.

In the final analysis, PTF is not a soaring work of genius.  However, its fun, serviceable entertainment which is an acceptable way to use up any idle time you have.",1416268800,11,4008,5.436187399030695

149669,2,0792843967,"This piece of silliness is a more or less direct sequel to THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT. The message in a canister that the hero of that movie threw into the sea at the end of the film brings a second expedition to the ""land that time forgot"" to try to locate and rescue Bowen Tyler and Lisa Clayton. The rescue party is better equipped, having somehow managed to bring along an amphibian aircraft. The party consists of an old buddy of Bowen Tyler's, Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne); an alcoholic copilot named Hogan (Shane Rimmer), who, thankfully, is left out of most of the action); Dr. Edwin Norfolk (Thorley Walters), a scientist (to provide the correct names for all the prehistoric miniatures they encounter), and of course the obligatory female, this time a feisty photographer named Charly (Sarah Douglas), who is there to chronicle the event because her father has put up the money for the expedition. They take off from the water and fly to the interior and crash land. The obnoxious copilot remains behind (thankfully) to repair the plane while everyone else sets out to locate the survivors of the first film.

Along the way they meet a cave girl with Farrah Fawcett hair and perfect makeup (not to mention a costume that shows cleavage to the navel), who happens to speak excellent English, having been taught by the very man they're looking for. She agrees to lead them to Bowen, which allows for encounters with less educated and far uglier primitive men, who are bent on the annihilation of everyone more educated and less ugly than they. Eventually they're taken captive by soldiers wearing armor and riding horses. (I'm not kidding!) They are taken to a series of caves, the entrance of which is a group of gigantic skulls. The women are prepared (in red silk garments, but don't concern yourself with where this fabric came from) to be sacrificed to the gods of the volcano. The men are locked in a cave, complete with bars on the door. In an adjacent cave is Bowen, from the first movie. They break through the connecting wall and form a formidable trio who set out to rescue the two damsels. They reunite and all flee, but not before the bad chieftain gets tossed into the volcano, setting it off. The remainder of the movie has multicolored explosions representing the molten lava spewing forth.

The group all manage to return to the plane and take off, reconnoitering with the ship, which is about to leave the area without them. Everyone lives happily ever after except Bowen, who is shot in the tummy with an arrow and is left behind...once again.

The movie is ridiculously stupid and even more ludicrous than the previous film.

It does have one funny line, though I'm sure it wasn't intended as such. There's the sound of some beast bellowing in the distance. Someone says, ""What is it?"" And the dinosaur expert says, ""It can only be one thing...prehistoric."" Brilliant!",1250380800,,2894,4.736111111111111
149670,2,0792843967,"""The People That Time Forgot"" (1977) is the sequel to ""The Land That Time Forgot (1975). Both titles were borrowed from Edgar Rice Burroughs along with the basic premise, a prehistoric tropical paradise in the heart of Antarctica; inhabited by dinosaurs and cavemen. Burroughs detailed how volcanic activity kept the region warm and how a rim of mountains protected the land from the frozen temperatures that surrounded it. The film does not bother to include these scientific details nor much else from the original Burrough's stories so don't think less of him just because some hacks borrowed his idea and make this movie.

The movie features an expedition to find Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) the main character in the 1975 film. The rescue effort is not exactly massive, it is a tiny four person expedition led by Tyler's childhood friend Major Ben McBride (John Wayne's son Patrick). The pairing of these two actors was probably an effort to demonstrate to the world that there was actually an actor out there with less talent than McClure. Wayne peaked at age 18 with a bit part as the youthful Lt. Greenhill in his dad's film ""The Searchers"" and mysteriously managed to find a succession of acting opportunities in vehicles so bad that even he could not damage them to any great extent.

The bottom line is that this movie works best as a mock party feature; complete with laughably bad special effects, Saturday matine serial quality production design, and high school play quality acting. Also good for some laughs is Dana Gillespie as cave girl exploitation element Ajor. Dana was a British singer, best remembered not for her tunes but for her lingerie clad presence on the cover of her album ""Weren't Born a Man"". Despite her enormous talents I always thought she looked too ""Butch"".

A young Sarah Douglas (of ""Superman"" fame) plays the newspaper reporter accompanying the expedition. Douglas was extremely beautiful at that age and has a fair degree of acting ability as well. I'm not sure what is the most out of place, a classy young woman heading into the jungle with this group or a competent actress being included in this lame ensemble.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1173916800,2,2202,4.848404255319149
149671,5,0792843967,"The Duke would have been proud of his son for making such a fine film. An expedition to the South Pole in search of a missing scientist brings forth a movie of which the world has never seen the likes of!

Enroute to the rescue the party is attacked by a pteridactl that downs their plane in the middle of no where. They must lasso a stegasaurus to get the plane unstuck. Special effects indeed that you must see to believe. But even more amazing than the special effects in the Cave Girl, ohh la la!!!!!

Her beauty must be seen to be appreciated. For a cavewoman she looks great. Perfect salon hair, makeup, shaved legs, and a rack that cannot be described. Her breasts are unlike anything I've ever seen, as if done by an artist. Her cleavage is absolutly perfect. This chick would give rival cavegirl Raquel Welch a run for her money.

Well the party survives attacks by more dinosaurs, vicious cavemen, and weird Samuris who ride on horseback. They worship a volcano god that wants sacrifices all the time. The chief priest looks a lot like Tor Johnson, the hulking Swedish wrestler who starred in Plan 9 from Outer Space and The Beast of Yucca Flats.

149672,5,0792843967,"I really don't have much to add as everyone has basically given more or less the same run down of the plot. I first saw this as the prime-time movie of the night on ABC network around 1979 or 1980? It was great and me being a dinosaur enthusiast was just ecstatic. My age at that time would've been 7 or 8 y/o. and with my young mind knew this had to of been a theatrical release.

  One of my favorite segments is when our weary band of survivors are walking through this cave and all of a sudden a group of six or seven long- necked dinosaurs come popping out of these holes in the cave wall, nipping at Sarah Douglas' torn arm sleeves- oh, what exitement! On top of that Sarah's character- Lady Charlotte""Charly"" for short, who was the resident photographer-as her uncle(the owner of the newspaper that financed the expedition), hired her for this excursion, finds an ingenious way to temporarily blind the biting dinosaurs with her camera's flash bulb so the others who are trapped on the other side of the dinosaurs can safely run through. The dinos are laughable as their mouths don't even bite, chomp or do anything. The characters could've just walked on by.

  Now you all know that Sarah Douglas went on to be the ruthless Elsa forever banished in the Phantom Zone along with General Zod and I forgot the third guy's name(is it Grodd?), in the classic 1978 ""Superman"" movie; only to escape in ""Superman II"". Then Sarah was the villianess in ""Conan the Barbarian"" along side Mr. governor of California,Arnold S.- too long to spell out-sheesh! Sarah was yet another sinister character on the television series ""Falcon Crest"". To top that off she was also a 'Visitor' rivaling Jane Badler's Diana in ""V the Final Battle"" mini-series. Diana showed Sarah's character Pamela, who was the queen of the lizards. The last movie I saw Sarah in was another ""Night of the Living Dead"" sequel from the mid 90's, againg playing a somewhat greedy, over amorous pofessor/laboratory technician who gets her cumuppence at the end of the movie. Sarah also appeared on an episode of the Brittish 70's sci-fi series ""Space 1999"", in an episode entitled 'The A/B Chrysalis'. Patrick Wayne played Sinbad in ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"", the third and final installment of the Sinbad films- also released in 1977. Whoa, was he busy filming in 1976 and 1977. Shane Rimmer was in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", also released in '77 and had a quick cameo as a taxi driver in ""Superman"". Dave Prowse, the muscle bound, testosterone laden executioner was Darth Vadar- physically, but the voice supplied that of James Earl Jones. He appeared to be much older in ""Return of the Jedi"" though. Tommy Britton who played Captain Lawton I think is 'Q' in the James Bond films. The rest of the cast I've never seen them in any other productions except this.

  I'm going to close with my all time favorite scene when Ajor(Dana Gillespie) bites Saballa's(Milton Reid) hand and he falls into the bubbling volcano ready to blow it's top. Then Ajor exclaims...""Nagaramata...when he speaks,all die""! How hilarious! When I repeated it several times to see what the other character's reactions were, it looked like they were biting their lips to prevent themselves from cracking up with laughter. Next time you guys watch this scene pay close attention to Sarah Douglas and Patrick Wayne. The late Doug McClure is just shaking his head and probably thinking who wrote this horrendous dialogue. Remember, you'll never escape the wrath of the island of CAPRONA!

149673,3,0792843967,"""The PEOPLE That Time Forgot"" is the much inferior 1977 sequel to ""The Land That Time Forgot"" from 1975. The basic plot is essentially identical to ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes,"" albeit far less serious.

An expedition (including Patrick Wayne and Sarah Douglas) goes to the savage artic hidden land of Caprona to find Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure). There they run into fairly cheesy prehistoric creatures and a ravishing cavewoman named Ajor (Dana Gillespie). She leads them to the Mountain of the Skull wherein Tyler is held captive by a hostile neanderthal-like tribe dressed in cool samurai apparel.

WHAT WORKS: The Spanish locations are outstanding, as are the costumes and many of the life-size sets and opticals. The story moves along pretty quickly (the flick's only 90 minutes long). Patrick Wayne and Doug McClure are Great and Dana Gillespie is awe-inspiring in her skimpy cavegirl outfit, in fact, in my opinion Dana blows the more popular Raquel Welch in ""One Million Years BC"" out of the water (Raquel is a bit too thin to my tastes; Dana has far better curves).

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The story is less serious than ""The Land That Time Forgot"" (i.e. campier) and not nearly as compelling; in other words, don't expect for a second to be enraptured by the story. The miniature sets are too-obviously unreal and the creature F/X are only mediocre-to-poor (for the time period).

FINAL ANALYSIS: If you're into these types of Edgar Rice Burroughs adventures, ""People"" is certainly worth having in your video library. It's nothing exceptional or captivating, but it's certainly fun, light and brisk. And catching the voluptuos Dana Gillespie at the height of her physical beauty is a must.

Loosely based on the writings of Edgar Rice Burrows, The People That Time Forgot (1977) is actually the third movie in a trilogy, the other two being The Land That Time Forgot (1975), and At the Earth's Core (1976).
The movie starts off on a ship cruising around artic waters.  We learn an expedition has been mounted to locate Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) who went missing from a previous campaign.  The team is made up of your fairly standard expedition team members, including the somewhat chauvinistic and handsome leader, Major Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne, son of John Wayne), his comic relief, boozy (he calls it 'nerve tonic'), smart alecky co-pilot/mechanic Hogan (Shane Rimmer), a beautiful and spunky photographer Lady Charlotte Cunningham (Sarah Douglas), and finally the crusty, brushy mustached anthropologist type (you know what I'm talking about) Dr. Edwin Norfolk (Thorley Walters).  Once the boat arrives at a certain location among the icebergs, the team sets out in a rather goofy looking amphibian aircraft.  Now I'm no aeronautical engineer, but I credit the fact that this thing could fly more to Hollywood magic than to its' soundness as an aircraft.
After flying for about, oh ten minutes or so, the snow-capped mountains give way to a tropical landscape (some lost land).  This sets up the first encounter with a dinosaur, a very amorous yet lifeless, wooden pterodactyl.  After the flying creature tries to mate with the plane, the amphibian aircraft suffers some damage and must land.  Once on the ground, Ben decides that he, Lady Charlotte and Dr. Norfolk will go searching for Bowen Tyler, while Hogan will stay behind and make the necessary repairs to the dubious aircraft.
During their search, the trio runs into a rather busty cavewoman named Ajor (Dana Gillespie) clad in typical, skimpy, barely there cavewoman attire.  I have to say, Ajor is one of the most well groomed cavewoman I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them.  Turns out she knows Bowen, as she came from a tribe that he's been living with for the last two years.  She also states (she learned to speak English from Bowen) that another tribe wiped out her tribe out of jealousy and kidnapped Bowen.  Apparently, competition to evolve within the cave dwelling community is pretty fierce, and Bowen would certainly provide and advantage.
Okay, so Ajor leads the group to the ancient City of the Skulls.  See that really bad matte painting?  This must be the place.  On approaching the city, a group of samurai soldiers comes out to greet and escort them into the city.  Once there, we get to meet the leader, Saballa.  Oh man, this guy's a treat!  Imagine the Jolly Green Giant only shorter, uglier, and extremely out of shape and you've got Saballa.  I kept expecting him to produce a can of corn niblets.  Anyway, seems Saballa doesn't want to be friends, and throws the men into a cell, while keeping the women with the intention of sacrificing them to the mighty volcano god.
While in their cell, the two men found out Bowen Tyler is in the next cell, and they push their way through the wall (some cell) and we get our first look at heavily bearded and unkempt Bowen (Doug McClure).  The men escape, mount a rescue for the women, which leads up to a final confrontation with Saballa and some of his goons.  I have to say, those samurai outfits looked pretty good, but seem very much out of place in a movie about a prehistoric land.  The group escapes, but now the volcano god is angered (I guess), as all hell breaks loose.  I had to wonder if the studio had a surplus stash of explosives they wanted to get rid of, as the last ten minutes or so of the movies is laden with the landscape blowing up, blowing up real good.  Do they all make it? Does everyone survive?  Do I really care at this point?  No, and you won't either.
Basically this movie played out like an hour and a half version of the TV show Land of the Lost.  Looking for a good, or even passable adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs's book?  Stick with the book.  This isn't a completely awful movie, as there's plenty of laughs, and a little eye candy, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend anyone run out and buy this one.
Another reviewer mentioned the appearance of David Prowse as the executioner in this movie and his going on to play Darth Vader in a little movie called Star Wars...another tie in to that movie is the hairstyle Sarah Douglas sports is exactly the same as Princess Leia's except Sarah's cinnibuns are a bit smaller.",1069113600,4,4571,4.6775
149675,3,0792843967,"""The People That Time Forgot"" is a 1977 sequel to the 1975 film ""The Land That Time Forgot.""  In between these two there was the 1976 film ""At the Earth's Core,"" which is mentioned mainly because all three films star Doug McClure, are directed by Kevin Connor, and are based on novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Ironically, the tag line for this film makes it sound like the films are a trilogy, although ""At the Earth's Core"" is based on the Pelucidar series.  This film is definitely the weakest of the three, which is not all that surprising because it is based on the second book of a second rate series of potboilers by ERB.  Once you get past Tarzan if you are looking for an ERB property to turn into a film you should be looking at the Martian novels about John Carter first, and then maybe Carson of Venus series or ""The Outlaw of Torn.""  But this Burroughs rehash of ""The Lost World"" is not the place to go looking first.
The basic plot reminds you a lot of ""Return to the Planet of the Apes.  Major Ben McBridge (Patrick Wayne) leads an expedition to Antarctica to find his friend, the American adventurer Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), who is marooned on the lost continent, Caprona, a.k.a., the land that time forgot, where there are dinosaurs and cavemen.  McBridge has a plane, but it crashes and his little expedition has to survive until they find McClure (where they can break the good news that they are there to rescue him!).  McClure had to deal with Germans from a U-Boat but McBridge has to put up with Lady Charlotte Cunningham (Sarah Douglas), who goes from royal pain to damsel in distress pretty quickly once things start happening, Dr. Edwin Norfolk (Thorley Walters), who fortunately knows everything about dinosaurs and cavemen, and Hogan (Shane Rimmer), the faithful side kick who is the obvious first choice to be dinosaur food.
""The People That Time Forgot"" provides the same sort of lousy special effects that plagued ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" but without the non-stop action and adventure that redeemed that first film.  Besides, Tyler has ditched Lisa, his paramour from the first film and replaced her with Ajor (Dana Gillespie), a cave woman who probably took the pretty English biologist apart with that big knife.  There is no need to watch this sequel out of a sense of completeness to the ""story,"" because you are not going to be happy to the ending.  However, pay attention to the Executioner, who is played by David Prowse, who came to this set after having wrapped up a little film called ""Star Wars.""",1044230400,14,2545,4.658482142857143
149676,5,0792843967,"A few years after the happened in Land That Time Forgot, and the navy have returned to the lost world of Caprona to find the missing survivor from the previous film.  This carries on its predecessor's trend of strong characters and good storylines - and the monsters are good considering the low budget.  It also develops things mentioned in Land, such as the lost island being a living thing with creatures as cells moving through its bloodstream and a volcanic self-defence against any invading viral strains.  Certainly well worth watching.",1036886400,6,543,5.011111111111111

Sequel to The Land That Time Forgot is also based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs story and is a bit less cheesy as it focuses on the primitive tribes more than the dinosaurs, but is also slightly less fun because of it. Still there is enough to entertain such as  busty cavewoman Dana (Dana Gillespie), who always looks like she just stepped out of a salon and the incomparable Shane Rimmer as a crusty pilot with a grudge against pterodactyls. Flick has Major Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne), a friend of Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), launching an expedition to the lost world of Caprona after Tylers journal is found floating in the sea. Along for the ride is a spunky reporter (Sarah Douglas from Superman 2) who provides McBride with a nuisance/love interest as they search the prehistoric land for his long lost friend. They encounter the usual rubber monsters and Capronas ruling tribe, a vicious blend of caveman and samurai.

Kevin Connor once again directs, but doesnt bring as much fun to this one as he did The Land That Time Forgot and At The Earths Core. An amusing romp nonetheless and is loaded with nostalgia and charm. Did I mention theres an erupting volcano? Not as enjoyable as the first flick, but still good fun and another old fashioned action adventure made with a lot of heart!",1515801600,,1523,4.696629213483146
