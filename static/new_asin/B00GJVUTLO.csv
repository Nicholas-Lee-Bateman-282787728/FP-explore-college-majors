8623955,5,B00GJVUTLO,"Sedona has always been a place of spiritual refuge and beauty.  Artists of all walks of life have emigrated or visited here for inspiration or a simple respite.  Director Kathy Douglas takes the viewer though the lives of sixteen completely different women, all artists in some respect and intersects their amazing life-tales together with the landscape of Sedona ever in the background.

All of the women are of retirement age or older and each one shares the intimate impetus of their reason for seeking out this 'magical' place.  Each individual has a valuable talent that is being realized and used daily and each person has been able to find extraordinary solace and peace in their environment.  The wisdom is disarming in its purity.  It's difficult not to get caught up in the stories told.  The most interesting aspect of each individual is the complete and overwhelming feeling of peace and gratitude.  Each one seems to have reached their goal of happiness and self-worth.

It's a rare journey that explodes with honesty and heartfelt sincerely as one story weaves into another, with Sedona ever-glowing as the backdrop.  The simple peace of mind one experiences while watching and listening to each of these souls is mesmerizing.  There is no way to describe the experience.  It can only be lived.
