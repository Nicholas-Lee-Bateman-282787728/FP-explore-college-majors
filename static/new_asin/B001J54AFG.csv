Lots of intrigue and doppel ganger set-ups.
Really liked what they are able to do with minimal money and sets., Never once thought `Oh, How direct-to-video' production, The script isn't cheap !
The acting was very good and the one with accent (Campion) never strayed from character, Thank God.
The effects and, Yes, There were a few gun shots in post, Were very well done.
Hope, Florida Tourism, Is helping you out...great scenic plugs.
Great extras and trailers...About that song, Migdalia that is most unsettling tune.",1224806400,,631,4.962264150943396
