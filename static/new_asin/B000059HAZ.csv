1407344,5,B000059HAZ,"This video is not what most people would expect when they buy a movie. It's about 11min, long, theres no sound except for some erie music that was added in to give feeling to the movie, and its shot on a 8mm home movie camera in the 60's. But thats what makes it so good. it shows Syd and Pink Floyd as normal people getting high in the countryside and outside Abbey road studios after they signed their contract. This movie has a personal touch to it that most movies shot of Syd and Floyd don't since they are usually highly organized affairs, while this was shot by a friend just having fun with his camera, which goes to show what a short old film you shot 1 day might be worth.",1043625600,13,682,4.174242424242424
1407345,1,B000059HAZ,I see myself as a die-hard Pink Floyd. I have just about everything on the Floyd I have managed to collect over the years (this even includes a dsotm tattoo). So I was very excited to see this item and ordered it immediately. But I have never been this disappointed.  These few amateurish minutes adds nothing to any Floyd collection. Pathetically poor filming and bad sound makes it even worse. It is obviously just an attempt to make money off loyal fans. Please don't inflict this on yourself. There's a lot of Syd stuff you can rather spend your money on. I feel cheated...,1018137600,16,577,4.548076923076923
1407346,5,B000059HAZ,"If the names Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Dave Mason elicit a response of ""Who?"" from you, chances are you should pass on this film, which, quite frankly, is for die-hard Pink Floyd fans only.  If you do fall within that category, however, you will probably view ""Syd Barrett's First Trip"" as a chronicle of minor historical significance, as it is a brief visual documentary of the day that changed Barrett's world forever, and consequently the future of Pink Floyd.
 The entire film runs a total of (approximately) 15 minutes, and is presented in two segments, the first of which takes place in the late summer of 1966, at a place called Gog Magog Hills.  It was (according to all accounts) the very first time Syd ""tripped out"" on mushrooms, and friend/film student Nigel Gordon was on hand, recording it all on silent, 8MM film.  Gordon was also there in April of 1967, outside Abbey Road Studios, on the day the Floyd signed their first recording contract with EMI Records, which comprises the second segment of the film.  There are glimpses of Waters, Wright and Mason, but Gordon's camera was mainly focused on Barrett, whose state of mind at the time certainly seems open to conjecture.  Very soon, of course, his situation would be beyond conjecture, as even before their first album was released a steady diet of LSD would take him to a place from which he would never return.
 A soundtrack recorded by the Hypnotic Records group ""Dilate"" has been added to this film, effectively creating an appropriately ethereal atmosphere that evokes a surreal sense of timelessness as the seemingly innocent events captured here by Gordon unfold.
 Some may argue that, in light of the fact that this was the beginning of the end for Barrett, this film is too personal to share with the world.  There's no denying it has something of a ""tabloid"" feel to it, and without question, the significance of it is, historically, in an entirely different context than, say, the Zapruder film.  But in the final analysis, ""Syd Barrett's First Trip"" is neither invasive, nor is it in any way an inditement, or-- at the other end of the spectrum-- an affirmation of his life.  In it's brevity, it's merely a glimpse; a quick look at a moment-- now frozen in time-- that marked the point of no return in a young man's life.  Syd Barrett was an artist, who very soon after this film was made, would be unable to create anything ever again.  One could say that the moment captured here was, in effect, the very instant that the music-- so alive within Syd Barrett-- died.  To their credit, Waters, Wright and Mason-- Pink Floyd-- endured and, thankfully, continued on; tragically, Syd Barrett did not.  And watching this film one can but reflect upon how truly fragile life is, and how quickly time moves on.  After all, what you see in this film really happened; and moreover, it was only yesterday that it did.",1014163200,48,2910,4.732673267326732
1407347,1,B000059HAZ,"This fifteen minute homemade film of former Pink Floyd songwriter (1965-68) Syd Barrett taking mushrooms and other drugs is absolutely degrading. Instead of remembering Syd as a brilliant songwriter and musician, it instead elevates his reputation as a reclusive drug addict. Syd was once a bright musician, with a lot of great ideas, and a brilliancy when it came to songwriting. But sadly he turned to drugs, and it severely damaged his mental health. Barrett has even made it clear through relatives and ""representatives"" that he does not want this part of his past flaunted by anyone or any company, and for good reason. This ""document"" is an insult to Roger Keith Barrett, the person. Drug addiction is a sad thing, but exploiting it on camera and releasing it to the public for their viewing pleasure is absolutely degrading.",1013990400,21,831,4.985611510791367
1407348,2,B000059HAZ,"Look, I dig Syd and his music as much as the next guy.  But there's no getting around it, folks.  This one is pretty doggone cheesy.  And that, honestly, is kind.  Sure, there are some groovy shots of Syd gettin' high in the hills, but not very many.  Not many at all.  And there are an awful lot of shots where (a) Syd is nowhere to be seen, and (b) you, the viewer, don't have a clue as to what the hell is going on.
This disc is all of 10 minutes long.  That's right, 10.  Syd's on screen for maybe 6.  The overall quality is that of a mediocre home movie, made by a stoner in 1966.  As for insights into Syd's makeup/development as an artist/psychedelic experiences/etc. etc. etc.......pretty much zilch.  If you gotta have it, you gotta have it.  Just don't expect a whole lot.",1009324800,16,782,4.244897959183674
1407349,5,B000059HAZ,"I know of no other video footage of an actual psychedelic session taking place. But even if there are this is more than that. This somehow actually ""shows"" the way it looked in an authentic shot into the world that Syd is traveling. Even though you're only getting to see it outwardly, it's paranormal. Looking at Syd and the transformation that takes place after the campfire trip when he is back in town, really shows how he was altered. When you see him in his Floyd attire later he looks, superhuman. Indeed, this movie captures the supernatural quality of what was going on there and during that time. It's almost hard to believe that someone had the presence to film it. It's a real look into the past, it's time travel, or as close as you can get and it's definitely somewhere you want to go.",1007856000,10,799,4.47945205479452
1407350,4,B000059HAZ,"This is a great piece of history, and is now available on DVD is a cool footage with syd and some kids running around doing shrooms and stuff, but that's not the important part, the important part is that here's the footage of pink floyd after signing there first contratc with EMI and that's history, the music is excellent although is not pf music, but if you have 10 bucks lying around pick them up and buy it.",1007596800,8,413,4.3076923076923075
1407351,5,B000059HAZ,"we,Floyd Fans,deserve more than what the market have for us till now,, I fail to see why the publishers are keeping on hold a DVD release of such classics like :Live at pompeii ,Delicate sound of thunder,Pulse,...etc
BUT,,I'm really glad to have this one in my library,,you should get it also if you're into collecting Rare Editions of Legendary bands like the Floyds..
and one last thing,,it's a correction of what an interviewer here have said this dvd is silent, it's not.  this DVD comes with music by Hypnotic Records recording artist Dilate.",984528000,13,547,4.881720430107527
1407352,5,B000059HAZ,"i have a vhs video copy. i will have the dvd as soon as i can get it.
it is silent just like the original.
shows syd and friends/girlfriend aroud a fire.  and some weird footage of syd with mushrooms in his hands and on his face...
also has some footage of band and manager shortly after first contract. and has some shots of some cool kids playing.
to make up for the silence, i dubbed lanky (part 1) over the video...really cool stuff.  >}:->",981072000,14,444,4.211764705882353

7933693,5,B000059HAZ,"I have this on video but unsure of release date. The front cover is of a much younger sid barrett to which is shown on the front of the dvd cover. Although only 11mins long this deffinately looks at sid from a different perspective thats for sure. So many reviews slate the quality but not everyone had top of the range and not forgetting this was originally done on 8mm. I think its another great link to a great lost artist who was taken away. To those who loved him and his music miss him dearly, but this was ultimately the start to an amazing career for the rest of Pink Floyd",1412121600,,581,4.196428571428571
7933694,1,B000059HAZ,"This early footage of Syd Barrett, filmed in 1966 & 1967 by Nigel Gordon, a friend and photographer, portrays two aspects of Syd's early life. Part I, entitled: ""Gog Magog Hills,"" shows Barrett in a field named after the title while experiencing his first trip. Part II, entitled: ""Abbey Road Studios,"" shows Pink Floyd after just having signed their first recording contract with EMI Records outside Abbey Road Studios in April of 1967. Interesting footage, but not very well done. I would only recommend this to die-hard Pink Floyd fans.",1203206400,2,539,5.0

7933696,5,B000059HAZ,"visually, syd's first trip is stunning. the colors, composition, and camera style combined with the frame stretching (due to projection) really add strength to the film's feel, as well as fit the content. hey, maybe it doesn't represent syd for syd, but if you look with your eyes you'll see it doesn't matter. this is, for me, a new viewpoint into the 1960s. my rule of thumb is that if the end result is compelling enough to watch, then why does anything else matter? i appreciate the fact someone released this, whether or not it shines a 'bad light' on syd. this is syd, is it not? he did do these things, right? it's been filmed, it's been sold; the only thing left to do is buy.",1142985600,6,684,4.393700787401575
7933697,1,B000059HAZ,I skimmed over the reviews before I purchased and somehow missed the 11 minutes long review.  If you are interested in finding out more about Barrett DO NOT buy this DVD.  It is mildly interesting in catching Barrett in a home movie with no professional cajoling or directing but taking it for what it is it is about as enterteining as watching your neighbor's home movie of them in a dasiy field with no sound.  Utterly useless.  Unless you are obsessed with Barrett and already own every piece of published material on the guy and just want this for your collection look for something else on him.

7933700,1,B000059HAZ,"There is absolutely no reason why any self-respecting (and band-respecting!) Floyd fan should purchase this DVD.  I have not and I absolutely refuse to do so on principle.  It is extremely unfortunate that someone feels the need to make money off of the ""legend"" of Mr. Barrett's troubles.  This myth is only a problem for him--it's what brings people uninvited to his doorstep, dragging up the memories of a life he no longer wishes to live.
A TRUE Pink Floyd fan RESPECTS all members of the band.  With that respect comes the responsibility not to make a soap opera out of their lives or to exploit them.  With Mr. Barrett this is all the more important given his withdrawal from the public life.  As I have said elsewhere, Mr. Barrett's story is a reminder that simply because someone gets the opportunity for stardom, he does not suddenly cease to be just like any of us. And I believe that none of us, going about our everyday lives, would appreciate such unwanted intrusions. Even Mr. Barrett's recent decision to autograph a photo book about his past should not, I believe, be taken as an invitation of any kind to his fans--those days are done, and his true fans know and respect it.
DO NOT waste your money on this--do not encourage the disgusting bottom-feeders who have no respect for Mr. Barrett as a human being.",1059955200,6,1325,4.641025641025641
