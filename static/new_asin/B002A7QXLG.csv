8359064,3,B002A7QXLG,"I ordered this because I wanted ""Unlikely Angel"". I have enjoyed both that and ""My Mother Wears Combat Boots."" I would give those higher ratings, probably 4 stars. I thought I would like the penguin film, but right away they were getting ready to show one dying. I couldn't handle it. I know it's natural, but a film with penguins dying is not why I watch movies. Maybe one later would be OK. The other one, I started to watch, and quickly lost interest.",1522368000,,454,4.416666666666667
8359065,3,B002A7QXLG,"Be warned - the packaging says that the penguin documentary is family-friendly,  but it shows graphic violence (seals tossing/eating penguins) and detailed,  drawn-out mating.",1412035200,,175,6.25
