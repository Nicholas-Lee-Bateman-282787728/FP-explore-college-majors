2260469,3,B000929VQI,"Jackie Chan has always used the original 'Police Story' series as a kind of safety net whenever his career hits a rough patch. The original was his response to his disastrous US cop movie 'The Protector' while the third entry was his attempt to recapture local audiences after a few high-profile failures. With his recent Hollywood outings scraping the concrete beneath the bottom of the barrel (The Tuxedo, Around the World in 80 Days, Rush Hour 2) he's gone back to Hong Kong and basics again. However, this time round he takes a few more chances, abandoning his old comic character and supporting cast (Maggie Cheung, Uncle Bill) for a comparatively darker outing as a broken-down cop drinking his way to oblivion after some thrill-seeking rich kids led by a typically OTT Daniel Wu kill his entire team. Naturally redemption is on the menu, but the stunts aren't quite as over-the-top or as plentiful as before, while the (intentional) comedy is kept to a minimum.

It's not up to the standards of his best work in the past, but it's light-years ahead of his US pictures and is a welcome return to form even if Chan's fight scenes fall short of his former glories (that said, there is a good bus sequence and an imaginative chase down the side of a building).",1119052800,6,1263,4.6891891891891895
2260470,4,B000929VQI,"Longtime fans of Jackie Chan -- that is, those of us who were fans pre-Rush Hour -- know that his craziest stunts have always been reserved for his Hong Kong productions, no doubt due to the conservative nature of American films' insurance companies.

However, in recent years, Jackie has been trying to lay the groundwork for his post-action career by taking on roles with minimal action so that he can display his acting prowess, which has often been overlooked by ""pure"" action fans.  He has shown great depth from time to time, and recent films like ""Gorgeous"" eschew almost all martial arts action in favor of real acting.

In ""New Police Story,"" Jackie appears to pass the baton to his young costar, Nicholas Tse.  I compare this film to ""Drunken Master"" or one of Jackie's other early films in that it is a master/student story, except that here, Jackie is the master on his way to retirement.

Jackie is Hong Kong inspector Wing, a 'top cop' who is disgraced when he leads a raid against a gang of rich punks that goes horribly wrong.  After falling into a drunken depression, the younger brother of on of the fallen cops from the raid (Tse) steps in to help Wing find revenge -- and peace with himself.

Jackie has a number of dramatic scenes in this film and he carries them well -- I almost forgot it was Jackie Chan and not Chow Yun Fat or another Hong Kong actor known for drama.  Jackie has a few action sequences, but he seems to allow Tse to carry out a lot of Jackie-style ""goofy fights"" in his stead (using his own coat as a weapon, etc.).  I should mention that this is a very dark, violent film, quite unlike the usual Jackie Chan fair.  Of Jackie's prior work, only ""Crime Story"" comes close, and this film is far darker.

All in all, this film is well worth seeing, although I suspect only Jackie and/or HK cinema fans will truly enjoy it.  4.5 out of 5 stars!",1115424000,13,1882,4.454810495626822

2260487,3,B000929VQI,"Jackie gives a good performance as a grief stricken cop. Yet, the story seems to far fetched to take completely serious and jackie hams it up too much in the tears department. Jackie does good in the action department for this film but he does blatantly obvious things to try and cover up his age during the fight scenes which backfire. Jackie can still run up a wall though. It's amazing that he's still capable of that. The main problem with the film is that the villains are not believable and neither is their doings. Though, i do recommend this film so one can see an interesting, dramatic film that differs adequately from the chan norm.",1459900800,,643,4.551724137931035

2260491,5,B000929VQI,This movie was different than others. Jackie Chan's acting abilities were really showcased in this film. I really enjoyed this film. Jackie was wonderful and the action was not disappointing. This is a more adult film due to it's topic but not in a way to deter a family night.

2260510,4,B000929VQI,"I've seen a lot of Jackie Chan movies; including the ones he did when he wasn't as popular and in his 20s. This has to be the most intense and darkest movie I have seen of his. This is because of the way they showed how some of the people died and Jackie Chan's connection to them. The movie did have characters that were inserted for comic relief and Jackie Chan's character had some comedic scenes.
I was trying to do some work while watching this but it was too interesting to just have on as background noise. The only thing that bothered me was the demeanor of the girlfriend. It just didn't seem to fit well with what was happening, but maybe I missed something. The stunts and action scenes were standard for a Jackie Chan movies so you won't be disappointed about that. The other thing that bother me is the voice over acting. I wish they would just film it in their native tongue or let them speak in English and use captions. Sometimes the voice over actors put too much emotions or too little emotion in their voice for certain scenes. Sometimes it throws me off because I am trying to read the actor's facial expression or body language and the voice throws me back into reality for a few seconds.",1413590400,2,1209,4.377777777777778

2260513,2,B000929VQI,"This has to be the worst of the Police Story movies.  The first two were campy, with a great mixture of light comedy and amazing action.  Supercop was...okay, but the story wasn't that compelling.  Then there was First Strike, which has to be one of my favorite Jackie Chan films of all time --- while not exactly continuing in the same line of the originals, it perfectly captured the action, choreography and humor that I love about Jackie Chan's films, and on an international stage to boot.  New Police Story though... oh gosh it's just terrible, I could hardly watch through it.  It focuses too much on younger (and annoyingly stylish/hip) actors, is WAY too serious, and skimps on the fight sequences to bring a gun-heavy, grittier, darker, and altogether excessively melodramatic chapter to what used to be a fun and exciting series.  Jackie Chan is almost reduced to a second-string character, spending most of the movie moping, crying, and being a depressed wreck.  I don't recommend this movie, as either a Police Story film, or as a piece of cinema --- it's just disappointing.",1409961600,,1088,4.848648648648648

2260515,5,B000929VQI,One of those serious films from Jackie Chan; there's abit of comedy but its very serious stuff. Great film to watch and liked Chan's remarks on piracy-working heard to make the film and its true the making of this film was very challenging as you can see.

2260518,5,B000929VQI,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1402185600,,236,5.184210526315789
2260519,4,B000929VQI,"New Police Story is basically a reboot of Jackie Chan's original Police Story series that started in 1985. The feel in the reboot is updated for the millennium generation, hosting a group of eccentric kids obsessed with killing cops in a video game like style. The movie is also grittier in tone and more story driven with more in depth characters and significant dialogue than the previous films.

Even at 50 years old Jackie is still bringing his physical style of stunts and action. Chan even homages himself and the first Police Story movie in a scene where he rides atop a double decker bus, running off walls and jumping over obstacles to keep pace. There are some very intense moments in the film and they do not hold back on the action. If you like Jackie Chan and any of the previous installments in the Police Story franchise, I do not think you will be disappointed.",1400544000,,877,4.585987261146497

2260521,3,B000929VQI,"I must of seen 20+ Jackie Chan films growing up and loved them all. The original Police Story is a classic movie that has everything that has made Jackie Chan's movies awesome:  crazy stunts and slap stick comedy.

The sad thing is, New Police Story doesn't have nearly as much as the originals did. There are stunts, but of course they are more toned down especially because of Chan's age (although he's still amazing). My biggest gripe is that the slap stick comedy is gone, replaced with a more dramatic tone like the police dramas you watch on the Chinese tv channels. The character they added for humor (That's my man!) doesn't hold a candle to Jackie Chan's humor and comedic timing, unfortunately, Jackie plays the complete opposite role, a depressed drunk, for almost the entire movie.

If you love Jackie Chan movies, this movie will not disappoint. However, those looking for some Police Story nostalgia are better off re-watching the original...",1388793600,,956,4.888888888888889

2260533,5,B000929VQI,WOWZA what an action packed cop/criminal movie this is. It really delivers in that department. Jackie Chan is awesome in it and I am usually not a big fan of his movies. I cannot imagine what his work out schedule must be to stay in good enough shape to do all the things he does in this movie. Daniel Wu was perfect in his evilness as the criminal gang leader and Nicholas Tse was just delightful as Jackie's helper.  The stunts on the buildings and bus were totally awesome. If this movie does not hold your attention from beginning to end I don't know which movie would. There's even some romance thrown in for good measure. Charlene Choi is a beautiful woman who exudes sweetness in this film as Jackie Chan's love interest.  Watch and enjoy!,1335139200,2,746,4.477941176470588
2260534,5,B000929VQI,"Usually Jackie Chan's movies have a substantial amount of humor in them, usually intermixed with the action sequences. To me that has always been a draw, as the dangerous stunt seem choreographed and flawless, the outtakes show a much more painful reality. But the finished work is usually awe inspiring. With this new addition to the Police Story saga, Jackie goes for broke. It's a melange of eastern Hong Kong movie styles and Western Styles. Jackie's inspector ends up falling victim to his own ego and must face of with a band of criminals who aren't in it for the money. They see it as a game, and even make it into a video game. the Inspector starts off rather gung ho, and ends up struggling just to survive and to keep his head above water. With a mysterious partner, he ends up finishing the job, but at a high cost. The action sequences are top notch and vertigo-inducint at times. But, with this film, the plot actually matters, this isn't just a mindless action flick (not that there is anything wrong with that). Jackie Chan seems to want to show off his acting chops in this one, and does a really great job. The action sequences never seem forced, and fits well within the over-the-top villians who are in it for the chaos. There are undertones of the ""like father, like son"" issue going on (on both sides of the coin) to show the influence parents have in the lives of their children. And all it takes is either one act of kindness or an act of viciousness to turn a child's life either around, or send it down the tubes. I really did like this movie. It seemed to have a lot of Western sensibilities mixed in with Hong Kong filmmaking techniques and I think that makes this movie more universal (even if it is dubbed). If you are a fan of cop dramas, action movies, martial arts, or Jackie Chan then this is a definite must have.",1327276800,,1847,4.435294117647059

2260536,3,B000929VQI,"New Police Story(2004) suffers from a weak script. There's contrived melodrama, contrived storytelling, and over the top action scenes. A bunch of rich kids who play video games and play sports all day go on a crime spree! Jackie Chan plays a drunk, burnt out, disillusioned police officer who witnesses his partners getting killed off! A police officer who admires Chan gives him a pep talk and tries to get him to bring these criminals to justice. Jackie Chan redeemed himself by doing some stunts and keeping the CGI under control. There's a cool scene where Chan slides down a skyscraper with nothing but a cable and a piece of iron! WOW! As an homage to the original Police Story(1985), there's an action scene with a bus! Lovely Charlie Yeung plays Chan's on screen girlfriend. I guess Maggie Cheung was unavailable. They show an English dubbed version of New Police Story every now and then on Spike TV. I first saw New Police Story on a ""bootleg"" Asian DVD that was in Mandarin with Chinese subtitles. I didn't know what the plot was about until I saw an English subtitled version.

But this one is different (it's not even really related to the classic Police Story movies) from his usual routine - it's dramatic.  It has pure *emotion*.  It is packed with action, but will also bring you to tears at times.  Jackie Chan's character is always undefeatable, but in this movie, bad luck takes it toll on him and breaks him down.  Thankfully, a young man steps up to bring him back to his A-game and defeat the bad guys (and the back-story on that is just absolutely heart-warming!).",1278979200,,562,4.683673469387755
2260540,4,B000929VQI,"Jackie Chan - hard to believe he's almost 60 now and still cranking out the action movies!

New Police Story has Jackie running up walls, smashing through glass and riding on a runaway bus through the city while making it look fun the whole time! While the story won't win any awards, it's a fun movie to sit down and spend a couple hours watching. The story has Jackie facing off against a group of teen troublemakers riding bikes, rollerblades and just running in places that would make most people scared just to stand still in - it all leads to some fun action scenes with everyone. Besides Jackie, it was nice to see Charlene Choi (of ""Twins"" and a number of movies) and Nicholas Tse.

The budget was pretty high on this one - I was impressed with all of the destruction going on throughout it. I've heard mixed reviews on the blu-ray, but decided to make the upgrade (I have the original release from when it was just coming out overseas) - the video quality was a definite step up from that already good looking disc (more than I expected for a budget title) - it won't win any awards but it's clear you're watching a Blu-Ray. Audio quality was good, not great. I'd say a step up from the DVD, but not a big reason to upgrade (the picture quality upgrade is much more noticeable). Extras, unfortunately, were sort of lacking. They run about 30 minutes combined and are presented in 480p - the overseas DVD release had quite a few more features, so it looks like Lionsgate might not have been able to acquire them and instead decided to make some ""new"" ones of their own (a dubbing session, commentary on 2 scenes and a 15 minute behind the scenes feature).

While it's not quite as cool as some of the no-wires stunts you see Tony Jaa doing, it's definitely enjoyable. Not quite  up to the original Police Story classics, but not too far behind. Overall worth checking out, especially considering the title can be found very cheap. Recommended!",1277164800,,1951,4.518413597733711

This Chan is older, wiser...and drunker. In short, he's a mess. He's even worse off than Martin Riggs in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon/dp/B000HWXEUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon</a>: Our second glimpse of him prominently features several adult beverages. A couple of scenes later, he's facedown in an alley. How the mighty have fallen.

Flash back one year: Chan is the hot dog cop stud, foiling grenade-wielding hostage takers and punching out shady businessmen in a scene that's a sort of Police Story Condensed. Shortly thereafter, Joe (Daniel Wu) and his gang of rich-kid criminals rob a bank and then...call the cops. Just when we start to wonder why the bad guys (and girl) want to stage a blatant open-air shootout in the street a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat/dp/B0017HRJ04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat</a>, instead of escaping when they have the chance, we learn that they're some sort of thrillseekers club, competing among themselves to win the biggest share of the bank loot via a point system. Kill higher-value targets (like, say, cops), get more points and more money.

Chan, cocky with previous success, declares on the TV news that he will apprehend the gang within three hours. Joe, however, has other plans, and when Chan's team ""infiltrates"" the gang's lair, the gang starts picking them off one by one. When Chan is unable to save them (indeed, Joe has cruelly engineered this foregone outcome), he spirals into depression and self-loathing, distancing himself from both the police force and his fiance, Ho Yee (Charlie Yeung), whose brother was one of the officers Chan lost. Just as Chan hits rock bottom, a young rookie cop (Nicholas Tse) appears to bring him back into the fold.

In stark contrast to the raw quickie HK action movies of the mid-90s like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Wanted/dp/B00000IC9B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man Wanted</a>, for example, NPS is very slick. Beautifully lit and shot, NPS features some mostly excellent visual effects and dynamic cinematography. It's not all gritty back alleys and shuttered storefronts; it's shining chrome and glass and neon. HK has never looked better. Despite all the glitter, however, New Police Story is darker and more twisted than any other Police Story film...or any other Jackie Chan movie, for that matter. OK, so even if this isn't the same series, NPS still features numerous references to the original PS series, including a double-decker bus that crashes through a lot of glass.

A solidly entertaining movie, NPS is, nevertheless, not without its annoying little foibles. For one, logic and physics go out the window--or should I say over the ledge?--immediately. The big action set piece in the beginning relies on that most implausible of movie gimmicks: the real-life video game scenario. Meaning that there are lots of intricate traps and setups that depend too much on people being exactly where they need to be. It's great in the movies, but it would never work in real life, because one misstep breaks the whole chain. Also, there's a little too much unnecessary wirework for my taste.

Not surprisingly, with all the neon, chrome and hot English-speaking hipsters, NPS is more than a little reminiscent of Benny Chan's earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gen-X-Cops/dp/0767850823/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gen-X Cops</a>&nbsp;(Benny just loves the HK Convention Centre). As much as I enjoyed the fluffy goodness of GXC, however, in the case of NPS I think there's too much Benny and not enough Jackie.

On the plus side, most of the gunfights are nicely restrained, and the police tactics are more realistic than usual. Perhaps my favorite part of the movie, besides Charlie Yeung's overbite, is a fantastic battle in Legoland between Jackie and Andy On, reminiscent of one of my all-time favorite JC fight scenes: the pachinko parlor fight in the mostly otherwise-forgettable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderbolt/dp/B000BVM1QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderbolt</a>. And there are some very funny bits that don't go over the top with the comedy. The ""ending"" was a little on the sappy side, but it still got to me, and the epilogue/flashback was even more resonant and touching.

At last, Jackie shows some real range (and a new hairdo, sort of, thank god). He goes from confident and cocky to subdued, tired and weary--and, holy cow, he gets emotional (and I don't mean just angry). Not once, but multiple times. It's different, but different is good.

The supporting players are well cast. Nicholas Tse is quite appealing here--not the lightweight he was in Gen-X Cops. At first I would have preferred Stephen Fung, but Tse won me over. (There is actually a cameo by Fung in the deleted scenes.) He even gets to play his role for some laughs, which was enjoyable.

The irresistible Charlie Yeung's Ho Yee takes the place of Maggie Cheung's longsuffering May and brings some heart and humor to a role that could have been spectacularly unrewarding. On the other side of the female equation is Charlene Choi, who has obviously discovered the secret of eternal youth. How else to explain why she still appears to be 12 years old? For some gravitas, there's Yu Rong-guang doing his badass straight-arrow cop schtick. A Mandarin speaker, Yu has here been dubbed into Cantonese--but with a distractingly deep voice (I kept thinking of Sonny Chiba in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Storm-Riders/dp/B002E2QH2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Storm Riders</a>).

The standout performer here, hands down, is Daniel Wu. He was merely serviceable in GXC, and I didn't dig him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purple-Storm/dp/B000E11676/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purple Storm</a>, but after seeing him in NPS, I have a new respect for him as (and I don't use this term lightly) an actor. As the quietly sinister tortured son-slash-criminal mastermind, Wu digs deep and puts it out there. Excellent job, sir.

I wouldn't bet that this will be the last of the Police Story movies, New or otherwise, but if it is, it serves as a fitting bookend. In any case, it's certainly not the last major HK outing we'll see from Jackie Chan. That I'd bet on. Hey, if Robert Redford is still making action-type movies at his advanced age, Jackie can certainly be making them well into his hundreds. And I almost hope he does.",1262995200,2,6957,5.7841796875

He breathed new life into the genre like no other with his humorous style of combat; and it's inspiring to still see him move like he does at his age.  The action in The New Police Story were just as fun as most of his lighter films; and the stunts were typically incredible, just as you expect from a Hong Kong production that isn't stiffled by Hollywood politics and/or insurance.  And despite the more dramatic seriousness of Police Story, with a little Drunken Master mixed in, I found myself laughing much more than I expected.  Aside from a few sequences that demand a little further explanation, The New Police Story was about as much fun as my favorite Chan films.  The only real disappointment of the Blu-ray was that Lionsgate didn't include a lossless track for the original language.  A lossless audio option is provided for the dub track; but only lossy audio is included in the original Chinese.  That said, since I had a guest that doesn't like reading her movies, I opted for the dubbed track when we watched it and was surprised at the fidelity.  The translation was word-for-word the same as the subtitles in the approx 5 minute portion of the film I compared the two.  And the harmonics sounded very natural and dynamic.  That Jackie did (most) of the voice dub for his character himself, further helped to make sitting through the dubbed track, not only bearable, but enjoyable.",1261872000,6,1439,4.674603174603175

Where he guarantees that he'll get the criminals involved in 3 hours.  Pretty egotistical on his part and it bites him in the butt hard.  As they go about their operation and all of his coworkers get killed off on this supposedly easy mission.

After this we find him in a deep, deep depression drinking to the point of the passing out and not knowing his whereabouts.  This goes for awhile maybe a bit too long for some tastes.  It takes him getting a new ""partner"" and reconnecting with his girlfriend to finally get him out of this funk.

With all the over the top stunts, great fight scenes and solid costars (even the villians) as they have a reason for the aggression and killing of police officers.

Where are the life lessons. This movie left Me in a dark mood. Crime Story shows that Jackie can play a straight role, but why make a Chinese version of a Steven Segal movie. Hope he never tries this type of thing again. This has nothing to do with the other Police Stories, and should not be marketed this way. Every one of the Police Stories were progressively worse but the first three still hold up, and the initial one is near perfect.

Unlike his other 4 installments of the police story series, this one doesent have really any comedic elements.  It's a straight up drama/action movie.  It came off a little depressing from what I remember, but it still had a pretty uplifting ending.  There is a fight towards the end that may not be to that long, but still makes you realize why you starting liking Jackie Chan.

I won't waste time describing the plot because it's listed, so if you read it you can kind of see how this is more of a serious movie.

2260556,5,B000929VQI,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Jackie CAN act!, December 29, 2006

This has to be the darkest Jackie Chan movie I've seen. But, that is not a bad thing. Here, we get to see Jackie expand his acting to the point of him being driven to tears as a malicious group of kids execute his team members one by one in front of him during a botched raid.

A New Police Story has Chan playing the disgraced inspector who must come back from alcoholism to bring justice for his fallen comrades. Enter a young man who mysteriously wants to help the fallen officer out. Of course, you don't know why until the end, but suffice it to say, he is the comedic relief at times and until the end, you have to wonder why he's there. What are his motives? Is he good or bad?

The unfortunate thing with this movie is some of it has been digitally enhanced to remove wires, but I can understand why. Unlike the first Police Story (which this has no connection with the previous characters), safety regulations are probably tougher now than they were when the first Police Story was shot. Plus, the budget is bigger and they can rehearse stunts. Of course, with Jackie Chan pushing 50, it's going to be tougher for him to recover from serious injuries. But, this doesn't detract from the action that occurs and believe me, there is some great stunt work in this movie.

The fight scenes are fast and furious, but don't expect there to be a lot. This is a story that hinges more on Jackie's character redeeming himself, both with the police force as well as his fiance that never stopped loving or believing in him, even when the inspector himself felt he was a disgrace. Many might not like it, but for me, it was refreshing to see the focus more on Jackie's acting and his character rather than the actual fighting.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, possibly even more than the first Police Story. It's more polished and Jackie's acting is superb. There is still the funny humor in it and the use of props during the fights, especially the Lego fight and how can you not forget the skyscraper escape down the side of the building? Wow!

This is a must see. I highly recommend it!",1167350400,3,2157,4.420654911838791
2260557,5,B000929VQI,"I purchased New Police Story recently, and after watching it with some friends, we all looked at each other and stated the above:  WHOA.  I grew up with Jackie in some hilarious movies, and I knew he had starred in movies with a serious flair, but this took it to a higher level.  To see him perform as a once highly accomplished Police office who has fallen from grace, and the reasons behind it is truly refreshing.

Jackie Chan is in my eyes one of the greatest martial arts movie stars, and his resume adds substance to it.  But this was almost like a passsing of the torch to Nicholas Tse, a rising star in HK, and hopefully for the whole world.  They worked well together, and the chemistry with the other co-stars such as Daniel Wu, Tak-Bun Wong, Alva Chung, and others is simply incredible.  But that is to be expected with the man Jackie Chan.

As with the many movies he's in, there is comedy that I believe is placed in the right places.  Nicholas Tse plays a good part as a happy-go-lucky person that irritates an emotionally scarred Chan at first, but proves to be his guardian angel in the end.

The extras on the DVD is good, but are not subtitled.  A small problem, but it doesn't wipe out the entertainment value.  The bloopers are one of my favorites during the end credits, and regardless of what language it may be in, it will bring a smile to your face.

I actually found myself watching the music video that Mr. Chan produced (ok it's not 50 Cent or All American Rejects, but c'mon...).  It was fun to watch, and the song itself was pretty solid.  I give it 3 out of 5 stars.

Overall, New Police Story is worth watching, if anything, for the action scenes and dark humor.  I recommend this movie for all Jackie Chan fans, for this highlights his skill, both in action and in drama, in a well-rounded form.  I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I believe it's worth the high rating, so I say watch it for yourself and then make your decision.",1166745600,,1968,4.3598901098901095
2260558,1,B000929VQI,"Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Jackie Chan and his work, but I just can't give this movie a good review. It is one of the most depressing films I've seen. Basic plot synopsis; Jackie has to watch all of his team members be executed, he is given an opportunity to save each one and fails each time. So thats the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film and all his closest friends are dead. The next portion of the film deals with him trying to drink himself to death. Then we watch his relationship with his fiance fall apart. Then we get to see one of the gang members being abused by his father. and thats at least two thirds of the film.

And then there's the whole subplot about the gang members making a video game out of all the people they kill so the good guys have to play the game in order to figure out what bank they're going to rob next. Kind of cheesy.

As I said, I really like Jackie Chan and he does display some really good acting talent in this film. But I don't like waiting until the last 20 minutes of the movie to see some good action and fight scenes especially when I just had to sit through some of the most depressing stuff I've ever seen.",1157155200,4,1156,4.065789473684211

This is one of his best films in years, featuring his strongest dramatic performance since HEART OF DRAGON and CRIME STORY.  There's drama (Jackie's character can't stop blaming himself for the deaths of some of his co-workers), suspense (will bombs that have been triggered go off?), character development (we actually get to see what motivates the main characters, especially Jackie's and Daniel Wu's!), gunplay (lots of excitement during armed robberies), kung fu (Jackie shows no signs of slowing down!), and amazing stunt action (buses, cars, rollerblades, bicycles, and very tall buildings!).  Even Daniel Wu turns in a GREAT performance!  I've always hated this guy's performances in the past because his acting has always been weak, but this movie has completely changed my mind.  He raised the bar, and succeeded in surpassing it.  Bravo, Mr. Wu!

NEW POLICE STORY is a tough, violent, melodramatic (in the best sense of the term) film, and a great change of pace for Jackie Chan...and his fans!  It is a must-see Jackie Chan film.  Welcome back, Jack...ie.

Warning:  Do NOT watch this movie in the English dub on your first viewing if you can help it.  The voice-over actors, other than Jackie, really stink and completely ruin the mood of the film (old school kung fu and comedy dubbing can be great fun, but the majority of new school dubbers are just awful, especially where dramatic films are concerned)!  There is, however, a not-to-be-missed feature on this particular DVD showing Jackie Chan dub his own lines into English.  It is a riot!  It's especially fun to see him dub the fight sounds!  Ughh, aghh,  ughh....aghh.  He really gets into it (which actually does have an effect on his fight scenes...and for the better!).

2260562,4,B000929VQI,"After the disappointing `Around the World in 80 Days,' Jackie Chan went back to his roots in Hong Kong film industry. What is amazing is that Jackie (who is over 50 years old) can still do the death-defying stunts, as is seen in this film. The fact that his best films are made in 1980s cannot be denied, but `New Police Story' delivers its goods with Jackie and some of the new faces from Hong Kong.

The story is given a new touch in `New Police Story.' This time Jackie plays a veteran Hong Kong police officer Wing, whose overconfidence leads to a botched raid. Feeling guilt deeply, Inspector Wing, now disgraced, is given to drink until a young `police detective' named Fung appears before him. With a help from Fung, Wing again begins to hunt the culprits responsible for the deaths of his men.

[NEW BREED OF VILLAINS] As in his `The Myth,' Jackie's answer to the recent boom of wuxia (Chinese period martial arts films), in `New Police Story' Jackie Chan clearly intends to do something different. The baddies of the new film are a bunch of masked young gangsters, who can rob and kill as if it is a video game. As a fan of Jackie's actions, I can swear that this is very unusual choice. For in many cases the villains of his films may have been assassins or gangsters, but they never acted like spoiled kids. It is certain that deaths are sometimes depicted, but not in this violent way. Violent, in this case I mean, for Jackie's film. The decision of director Benny Chan (`Who Am I?') would divide the viewers' opinions, but it is certain that he and Jackie are trying to seek a new direction.

[ACTIONS] But you want to know the actions. Good news is that Jackie is still alert and agile, and can move like when he was in his first `Rush Hour.' Considering the fact that he is now over fifty, this is just incredible. There are two outstanding scenes here; one is Jackie climbing down the vertical wall of a tall building in a very unique (and dangerous) way, followed by Jackie hanging on the roof of a runaway bus in the street of Hong Kong. The other is in a Lego showroom, where he shows a bone-crunching fighting against one of the baddie.

[ACTING] This may not interest you, but Jackie does another new thing, and that is acting. Well, of course he must have been doing that for long, I know, but what I mean is he takes more time to reveal the complex nature of the character he plays, to show his ability as actor. There is even a love interest for his character.

[SUPPORTS] Some of Jackie film fans seem not to remember the names of the supports, or you just don't care. For `New Police Story' Jackie assembled great cast. Nicholas Tse as mysterious Fung is a standout among them, and so is Daniel Wu as the leader of the gangs. Among the fighting scenes, Andy On shines who was wasted in deplorable `Black Mask 2.' As to the female players, after the 8 years' retirement Charlie Yeung comes back as love of Jackie's inspector, giving the rather generic story a human touch, and very busy (and very cute) Charlene Choine from the popular duo Twins also appears.

`New Police Story' may not be the right place if you are going to see Jackie Chan films for the first time. It is overlong, sometime unnecessarily serious and violent, and Jackie's stunts, thrilling as they are, are not his best. Having said that, I must say it is a welcome addition to the works of one and only Jackie Chan, far better than any recent English-speaking films of his.",1150416000,23,3470,4.456692913385827
2260563,4,B000929VQI,"I just watched NEW POLICE STORY last night, not knowing anything about it. What a fine, well-made, exciting film! Jackie Chan is getting a little long in the tooth for this sort of thing, especially when pitted against all these kids, like the baddies and his new partner. But he can still put it out. Some of the stunts maybe aren't so ""wow!""-inducing as in the past, but the triple-slide down the building ranks right up there with the best (even if they cheat with cables that get digitally erased!).

This is a far cry from JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE, the first Chan movie I ever saw...and miles above some of his recent American films, especially TUXEDO (although I did quite enjoy AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS). Not only is his acting surprisingly good, especially considering the language thing and the dubbing, but his supporting cast deserves equal credit, notably Nicholas Tse as his badgering partner.

My only complaint is that it takes a bit too long to get moving. We get the picture right off: He's a drunk because of guilt over allowing his team to get slaughtered due to his pride and bravado. Fine. And we know he's going to snap out of it. But I think the director had him wallowing in his self-pity a bit too long.

Also, I was somewhat put off by the editing, with various shots of action sequences overlapping. Too much deja-vu.

But all in all, a wonderfully enjoyable film.",1149724800,,1396,4.594377510040161
2260564,4,B000929VQI,"I'm glad to see Jackie Chan finally returning to his true style of action after years of mediocre Hollywood. He is finally given all the freedom he needs to add the extra punch! He gets to be a good, dramatic actor again, since now, for the first time in YEARS, he can speak is native Cantonese language. He is not as fast and agile as he was in the good old days, but even at 50 years old he can show us that without Hollywood's leash, he can still pull off some high kicks, jumps, and sweet moves. Like many of his Police Story movies, there's a sweet car and bus chase, gun fight, and all the hand-to-hand combat true to Jackie's style. Jackie must now fight a new breed of crime, a group of criminals who's only true goal to make fools of the police and kill as many as possible!

Jackie Chan must be becoming more trusting of American film companies with his movies. He is now actually doing his own English dub here, but the original Cantonese soundtrack is present too.

This DVD/blu-ray from Lionsgate has the movie uncut, with the original language and aspect ratio, as well as behind the scenes featurettes. Buy this DVD to let North American companies know that this is the only way to release an Asian film!",1149552000,,1219,4.389380530973451

This is a Jackie Chan Action Film with all of Jackies crew. This movie has it all, good fights, good action, and good acting.",1148601600,2,288,4.0701754385964914
2260567,5,B000929VQI,Finaly An American Release Does Justice To A Great Film. First Off The Movie Is Great And Jackie Has Barely Slowed Down If He Has At All! THe Fight Scenes Are Great And It's Interesting To See Him In A More Serious Movie. That Aside The Dvd Release Is Great! Great Picture Great Sound And Also It Has Either Overdubbed English OR CANTONEESE YES! Belive It Or Not You Get Both On Here And It Has 2.1 Or 5.0 Dolby Digital So It Sounds Great Too. So Overall It's One Of Jackie's Better Movies The Best He Has made In A Long Time And It Gets An Extra Star For The Great DVD Options.,1147824000,5,578,4.078947368421052
2260568,5,B000929VQI,"Have the Hong Kong version; it's terrific!!  Non-stop action and a great story.  This is Jackie at his best.  Just hope the US/Canada movie has not been cut as so many of his films have before reaching us.  I know Jackie has done the dubbing for his own voice, and it will nice to just watch the movie without having to read the sub-titles.  Can't wait to get it!",1146960000,2,363,4.202898550724638
2260569,5,B000929VQI,"Wow! finally this movie is coming to the US!

My friend let me borrow his import version ,

This movie is has it all. Shoot Outs, Jackie Chan going all out in hand to hand combat, chases and yes a good story!

the music and camera work are great too! And Jackie Chan is not doing comedy here..

This is what yo've been waiting for!
