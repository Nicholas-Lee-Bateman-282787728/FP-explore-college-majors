Well, for those of you who are planning to watch Sirf, it isn't all that bad or let me say, not as bad as Tashan. It is the story about unfulfilled dreams. It is the story about not so content people, who are just not satisfied with the way things are in their life. It is also about breaking away from the monotony of one's life in such a way that it can ruin one's life. This movie could have been executed better, but the acting of Ranvir Shorey, Kay Kay Menon and Sunali Kulkarni has certainly made it a watchable movie!!!",1300838400,,659,4.238095238095238
