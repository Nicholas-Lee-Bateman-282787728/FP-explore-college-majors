4718169,5,B005KQVDUA,"Police Procedurals are a major part of network television. The legacy of police procedurals started with the old classic Dragnet, and since then many notable titles have passed through the airwaves in this genre of television. From The Untouchables (which would later be adapted into a popular film starring Robert DeNiro, Sean Connery, and Kevin Costner) to Columbo to Hill Street Blues and beyond the police procedural is a large part of television history. These days you can't get passed the glut of CSI's, NCIS's, and other procedurals that clog up the airwaves. In my mind the supply far exceeds the demand, but when these are some of the highest rated shows on television it can't be true.

And from that last sentence you can probably tell that I'm not typically a fan of police procedurals. Typically I find that police procedurals tend to prize style over substance worrying more about fleshing out their cases rather than their characters. While there are exceptions to this rule (such as Castle, which a good friend of mine recently got me into), the vast majority of procedurals seems to follow this rule. Leave it to JJ Abrams, though, to completely defy convention. With the help of constant collaborators Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (whom he also worked with on Star Trek and Alias) he created the genre bending sci-fi procedural Fringe.

Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) works for the FBI, but a gory case leads her into the realm of Fringe science. Because of her diligence in solving the case and saving her partner John Scott (Mark Valley) she is recruited by Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick) to work with the FBI's Fringe Division. Working with scientist Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and his son Peter (Joshua Jackson), she attempts to solve cases involving science that appear outside the realm of scientific possibility, and the cases appear to be in a pattern leading to a much larger event that could threaten the existence of our reality. Throughout all of her cases she also learns that those around her as well as herself may have more to do with the events surrounding them than she anticipated.

With Fringe, Abrams decided to blend procedurals like Law & Order with culty fare like The Twilight Zone and The X-Files. Where his past shows like Lost and Alias had difficulty attracting new viewers due to their complexity, with Fringe Abrams and his collaborators decided to make a show that worked on an episodic level that would allow viewers to enter at any given episode while still having a complex over-arching narrative that shapes the mythology of the series. The result is a mystery of the week series that rewards audiences for following the series long term.

While it would be easy for a show like this to focus more on the fringe science and procedural aspects of the show and less on the characters, the writing crew knows how to use these aspects in an effort to flesh out the characters. Throughout the series we learn more about each character which helps the audience to understand why they work the way they do. Walter is a huge example of this. As the series starts he seems as though he's nothing more than the obligatory mad scientist with weird ticks such as crazy cravings for random foods. As you continue through the series you learn that there's a reason for Walter's ticks and cravings that go much deeper into who he is fundamentally as a character.

The acting in this show is brilliant. Of course, some of you might remember John Noble as Denethor from Lord of the Rings (another character slipping into madness), and from that you can see that he definitely has some skill. Here he gets to offer moments of levity as the extremely brilliant but not all there Walter. As his equally smart son Peter, Joshua Jackson walks a tight rope. Peter is good natured, but also from the start a bit of a charlatan. Playing him too much in one direction or the other would keep him from feeling real and would not allow for the audience to associate with him, but Jackson keeps the beats to the character's evolution real. Anna Torv does a great job being the audience's guide into the world of fringe science. As we delve into the world of Fringe we know as much as she does, and really as much as Peter does as well. In a way their chemistry is a large part of what makes the series work. In Olivia you have the unquestioning disciple willing to explore this world, and in Peter you have the constant skeptic. They play off the audience's reactions to the world we've been invited to view with them.

With all of that, Fringe lands on my top 10 TV shows list. Unfortunately, being moved to Friday this season might not bode well for its future, I hope that we get to see the series play out the way that the creators intended to the very end.

5/5

8477123,4,B005KQVDUA,"We enjoyed the series on TV and added the DVD so that we can continue to enjoy it.  FRINGE  is a unique SciFi series whenre science opens the door to a parallel universe that is dying.  Walter, the scientist that created a wormhole to this other universe, also opened up the opportunity for them to enter ours.  And thus the action takes place as they try to save their world.  Great acting, great story, and many surprises along the way!  We were sorry to see the series end.  The DVD also includes interesting bonus material and interviews with the actors.",1424822400,,558,4.52
