8094159,3,B000BY9VQE,"This film is a three part, but connected, story about a fictitious cult based in India. I do not want to give too much away about this movie, but I will tell a little about the content. I guess I do not need to mention this is graphic, but I usually like to warn the squeamish type before making a purchase.

The first part deals with a journalist who travels, undercover, to a mental hospital to interview a former cult member to find out that this was not a very good idea.
The second part is about a young man who is at a mental hospital in lieu of prison only to be treated by a Dr. who is an alumni of the original cult.
The last part is in my opinion the scariest of all about a young woman who is possessed by some demon. A con artist ""faith healer""  former cult member unleashes her from the possession which sets the demon loose to find someone else to inhabit. Pretty scary stuff.

The beginning does go into the cult briefly and gives you a starting point to base the three linked parts together. So you are not just left wondering how these stories relate. It is the key to all of the stories.

This film is more suited for the cult classic horror genre and I might mention that it is dubbed in English. Not a deal breaker for me. There is also a fair amount of classic gore and blood. I personally enjoyed the movie and would recommend this to any horror or independent film fan.

Overall I think the film was low budget, but they managed to make a pretty good and scary film with the money.",1361404800,,1504,4.172413793103448
8094160,1,B000BY9VQE,"All these positive reviews must be by people involved in the production, because this is just another awful shot-on-video amateurish home movie.  Save your money.  I wish I had.",1248048000,3,177,5.068965517241379
8094161,5,B000BY9VQE,"The greatest critics on the part of the global conspiracy that deals with cults and religious themes will be unable to link the non - existent Taylor - Eriksson group with the Illuminati or the Golden Dawn.
In the group , an enthusiast of psychotherapy who has undergone self - initiation through gestalt - therapy , decides to form a self - help group in Poona in India with the aim to liberate it's members from among other things negative karma in future lives.
The plot revolves around three members who had survived the group leader's pre - consciousness shift era experiments in the raising of consciousness.
The future becomes unpredicteable for the group leader as he loses control of the group and the group loses control of tulpas generated as a result of confrontation of various fears. Two of the survivors go to Germany , one becomes a psychiatrist patient , the other a psychiatrist who believes himself to be capable of healing negative karma.
The tulpas return to haunt their creators , and the group is dissolved as a result. Just to let people know there has never been any group that went by the name of the Taylor-Eriksson group and it is not associated with the original Golden Dawn in any manner.
Until this film arrived , so far there had been little sucess in constructing splatter films. The most famous splatter film since then had been Braindead , which is of course a comedy like Bad Taste.
Tears of Kali is an extremely spiritually liberating movie which terrifies the viewer into self - realization. The viewer in turn becomes obsessed with finding out the truth about the non - existent Taylor-Eriksson group , because the Taylor-Eriksson name is so haunting it cannot possibly have revealed any real person to my knowledge.
During the first time I watched the film I had no doupt in my mind that it was fictious and not based on anything else but rumours about cults which made their members go through horrendous rituals in the 1980's , such as the Order of Skull & Bones whose rituals seem far less frightening than the therapies in this film.
Furthermore the film focuses heavily upon the theme of Indian self - discovery group of which we know even less than the western ones.
This film is made during the era when Drunvalo Melchizedek , Bob Frissel and David Icke are young men who are at the best time in their days and it has been decades since Aleister Crowley died. This film is so important to me that I feel that it's director , composer and some of the actrors , any who would like should visit Iceland and lecture about the movie , and about primal scream therapy.
The man who leads the movie is symbolic of the author of the book Primal Scream. The therapautic subjects are symbolic of the viewer who is led into an Inferno , a chapter in his life where he must confront the dark side of his soul so that he can move on in his journey. In the end of the film it is revealed that the viewer has been put into the shoes of all the members of the group but I will not disclose how. As a splatter movie and a slasher film this film shocked me brutally , and it not easy for horror movies made by any director to shock me brutally. It did - and it has become the most recent cult classic in the history of German cinema.
Funnily this film is often linked with the New Age. It's subtitle is; Dark Side of the New Age. The fact is this film has in my view absolutely nothing to do with the New Age. It has to do with a message which becomes profoundly clear once the second film in the triology has been watched after two or three times. This film goes beyound the New Age into a form of existential angst appropriate for 21st century thinking. There are no ascended masters here or related new age themes except maybe the concept of karma but even in this movie that concept is lifted from the veil of many of it's deranged fundamentalist new age proponents. Of course we have past lives but there is no need to go into extremes about the interpretation of the meaning of that.
In this film that is done freely and in a manner that takes the film beyound almost all splatter movies that have been produced since before.
The film reminds me also a bit of the story of Arthur Gordon Pynn in H.P.Lovecraft's short stories.",1245974400,2,4259,4.433673469387755
8094162,5,B000BY9VQE,"I saw this movie years ago and recently purchased it. It is a great movie.. yes, it's dubbed, but that is the only drawback. It is a great occult/horror film and can rival most movies produced by Hollywood any day of the week.",1244764800,,226,4.27906976744186
8094163,1,B000BY9VQE,"I again make the mistake of taking the advice of some reviewers and bought this horrible movie. It consists of three loosely based stories none of which are very good or scary. The first 25 minutes of this thing consists of  someone relaying the back story, very dull. There is one slight scar in the film otherwise not very good. In fact the guy who put this movie together must have been a dropout from film school, he goes out of his way to use every annoying cut, slice and angle you could think up. Oh and have I mentioned that the dubbing job is not very good. Keep your money for a good horror movie, pass on this inferior film.",1243900800,2,635,4.24793388429752
8094164,3,B000BY9VQE,"This German horror film (dubbed) revolves around a group of people (back in the heyday of the 1980s !!!) who experiment with Indian religion/meditation.

The film then diverges into two separate short stories about two different horrors that come out of that group's experiments.

One is a woman who desires to get to the truth of how her brother died - by visiting a mental patient (part of the group). She learns that in the experiments they were able to conjour up evil spirits.

The other story also involves someone conjouring up another murderous spirit.",1156204800,,560,4.873684210526315
8094165,4,B000BY9VQE,"I don't know why I rent this movie, I have never heard of it. However I really enjoyed it. It is well shot, with more than decent FXs for a low budget movie. The dvd image is not as sharp as it should be and the sound is ok, but the movie is GOOOOOOD! This is to show Hollywood that big boudget special effects are not what makes a movie, sometime less is more. Overall: VERY GOOD!",1144972800,,381,3.961038961038961
8094166,4,B000BY9VQE,"""Tears of Kali"" is actually three films; three short stories centered around people involved with a cult that practiced Indian mysticism.

All three stories focus on ex-cult members, after the cult is disbanded when its leader is murdered (torn to pieces by something/someone). This movie does have a low budget but it really earns its ""R"" rating: there's plenty of nudity, blood and gore. This film is not a ""Ring"" type of horror movie. The sound is not so great, the original German dialog is dubbed over poorly but some of the performances are really good.

If you are a horror film fan, then this film is definitely worth seeing.",1135987200,4,633,4.745454545454545
