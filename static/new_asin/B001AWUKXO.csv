3473133,5,B001AWUKXO,"HONDO is a solid Western in the best tradition of the genre. Based on the story ""The Gift of Cochise"" by Louis L'Amour, John Wayne brings the character Hondo Lane to the screen juxtaposed with his familiar screen presence yet true to L'Amour's spirit of the literary ""Western."" James Edward Grant's script is impressively sympathetic to the American Indian given the period when this film was produced. Geraldine Page as Angie is perfectly nave as the homesteader living alone with her son in the open wilderness of rock and dust (artistically captured by Robert Burks' cinematography). However, it is John Wayne's portrayal as the enigmatically tough yet unemotionally tender survivor of this barren country that is the strength of this film. The music for HONDO is credited to both Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer and their impressive melody for HONDO majestically reflects the honorable and brave stature of the man.

What is interesting and probably what immediately drew me to the Spaghetti Western genre was that it held a very out of the ordinary romantic vision, not of the west, but rather a romanticized vision of the loneliness of its heroes or perhaps more perfectly its anti-heroes. If you listen to Ennio Morricones scoring of the Morton sequence in Sergio Leones THE ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, he captures the loneliness and pathos of these characters that traverse these strange western landscapes in such melodic splendor that your heart just reaches out to the whole mythology and you become overwhelmed by the euphoria of sight and sound. Leones THE ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST may in one sense be the elegiac expression of this idea as we see the old giving way to the new in death and life simply going on as the landscape evolves to whatever new times bring.

1969's TRUE GRIT with John Wayne is such an unlikely John Wayne Western. It is simply a Western and a good one. It was directed by Henry Hathaway had has all the hallmarks of his style. This film has a great cast and a wonderful score composed by Elmer Bernstein. I think many have come back to this film in recent years and discovered just how good it is and have found that it is an important part of the American cinematic genre of the Western.

These are 3 diverse yet strong Westerns.",1428105600,,2275,4.711055276381909

3473136,5,B001AWUKXO,"This package contains three solid westerns.  Hondo was one on the first westerns to utilize 3D technology.  Once Upon a Time in the West has been called one of the greatest westerns ever.  The musical score is second to none.  True Grit is the only movie for which John Wayne won an oscar for best actor.  It too is a good old-fashioned western with great background music.

These three movies are all on Blu-Ray format, so the picture is wonderfully clear.  I found the sound a bit fuzzy on Hondo, probably because it is the older of the three movies. Each movie has its own disk, each having multiple viewing options, commentaries, etc.  This is really a complete set of westerns in terms of all the add-ons.  I also like that each movie is close-captioned for the hard of hearing (and in multiple languages).

Any western film lover will appreciate this collection.  As a big fan of western movies, this is a wonderful addition to my collection.  It also makes a good gift (I got mine for Christmas!).

If ""Hondo"" was originally filmed in a 1:33 aspect ratio, it should have kept that way for the HD release.

8279986,5,B001AWUKXO,"ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST

""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is more than a classic western. This movie is more of a classic docudrama. It is based on actual events here in the United States during the time that the railroads were expanding, to eventually connect our distant coasts. It does so in the guise of looking at a town-not-yet-built and the political back-and-forth that could destroy it.

The movie starts out very slow with the murder of the family that is planning to build the new town to attract the railroad, and there are many slow parts, but eventually it picks up steam.

While you are watching this movie, try to identify other older westerns that the director and producer are honoring by shooting short scenes that almost look like they were lifted out of those movies. Shane comes to mind, as the boy yells out for his father.

It is a long movie, almost three hours. If you can borrow the commentary, it is well worth watching a second time with the commentary turned on. You will hear many historical details therein.

I  highly recommend ""Once Upon a Time in the West""

TRUE GRIT

So many westerns concentrate on the men and what they had to do to survive in the old west, but surely there were many women who had to go to extraordinary lengths to survive. Though I'm sure that this movie is fictional, I'm sure there were women like our heroine who did seek revenge on those who harmed themselves or their families.

HONDO

If you have read ""The Gift of Cochise"" by Louis L'Amour, you definitely want to watch the movie. John Wayne plays the main protagonist, Hondo Lane, and though you can see classic John Wayne in his portrayal, the film remains true to L'Amour's vision.",1435363200,,1746,4.614886731391586
