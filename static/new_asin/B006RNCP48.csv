8503626,5,B006RNCP48,"This is a real treat for Gina Lollobrigida fans.  It follows Lina Cavaleri's life as an Italian opera singer and international playgirl around the turn of the 19th century.  This woman was reputed to be the most beautiful in the world at the time and if you look up her pictures on-line you will have to agree that she was quite an eyeful.  She was also one of the most accomplished practitioners of the art of extremely tight corseting and had a waist so small that audiences at the time (who were more used to such things) reportedly gasped at the sight of her.  Gina went all the way to try to reproduce this image of a beautiful woman with an incredibly small waist.  One of the highlights of the film is a long dueling scene where she runs and jumps around wearing only a corset while sword-fighting with another woman.  How she managed to do this while cinched in to such an incredibly small waist-line (supposedly the smallest ever achieved in a studio film by a major actress) without fainting is still a mystery.  The print quality is reasonably good and, although not on a par with a remaster by a major studio, is easily watchable and well worth the money.",1329004800,5,1167,4.476415094339623
