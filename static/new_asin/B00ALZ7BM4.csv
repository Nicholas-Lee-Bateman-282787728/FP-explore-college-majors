8553461,5,B00ALZ7BM4,The choreography set to this Bach piece by the Zurich ballet  is just as inspiring to watch as it is to listen!  Wonderful choreography! Couple this performance with the Bach Cello suites also performed by the Zurich ballet and you will also be moved by both music and choreography!  Want to go Bonkers???  Buy and watch Mozart's the Great Mass danced by the Leipzig Ballet!  You are in the holy of holies! in the celestial kingdom! Hear...watch!  Be inspired!!!!,1424995200,2,463,4.7974683544303796
8553462,5,B00ALZ7BM4,"Heinz Spoerli is one of my favorite choreographers and I wish more of his very large body of work were available on DVD. He is famous for all types of ballet from the very classical to the very modern. In this work, he gives us an abstract ballet set to some very baroque music. As the title suggests, the ballet is set to Bach's Magnificat. The choreography is mostly of a classical style with solos, pas de deux, and other groupings. It is best classified as abstract but as is the case with most abstract ballets, one can't help but imprint some thematic elements. As Balanchine said, whenever you put a man and a woman together, you have the basis of a story. In any case, there is certainly no clear story here.
Spoerli's dancers are all superb. You won't find a ballet company with higher standards.
Image and sound are excellent. Unfortunately, there are no special features.",1370044800,4,882,4.5886075949367084
