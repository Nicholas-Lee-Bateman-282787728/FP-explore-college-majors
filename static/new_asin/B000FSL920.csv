There is only one DVD in the case, I wanted to watch the special features but there is no disc 2. It looks like it was not even intended to be, the case is only for one DVD. Did I get an unauthorized product????",1293926400,3,290,3.85
2584168,2,B000FSL920,"Some movies stand the test of time, and some don't. 'Kaho Naa...Pyaar Hai' was a box-office hit, generally liked by critics, and it cleaned up at the Filmfare Awards--Best Actor and Best Debut went to Hrithik Roshan and Best Movie and Best Director went to his father, veteran filmmaker Rakesh Roshan. It's evident in this, his first film, that the junior Roshan, now a superstar, is a natural-born actor as he skillfully assumes a dual role and gives each of his characters distinct personalities. The movie itself is mildly entertaining, but a disappointment in retrospect, given its strong initial reception. Bollywood has changed so much in the last decade (for good or bad is a matter of debate for some) that it's amazing how dated a 10-year-old Hindi film can be.

Hrithik plays Rohit--a car salesman by day and a struggling musician by night. Rohit and his much younger brother Amit are orphans (although it's never explained what exactly happened to their parents) and they live with an older couple (it's never made clear if these two are related to the boys or merely renting a room to them). Rich daddy's girl Sonia Saxena is played by Amisha Patel, also in her film debut, but unlike Hrithik, she went on to have a middling career.

Sonia's father (Anupam Kher) buys her a car from Rohit, who delivers it to her personally. Rohit then crashes her birthday party and sings at it. They take a fancy to each other and go on a cruise together with all their friends. Sonia gets drunk on champagne, Rohit joins her, and they pass out in a lifeboat that breaks away from the cruise ship. They end up on a deserted island, but these goody-two-shoes don't fool around. Sonia's father suspects otherwise, however, and when he rescues the pair, he decides to keep them apart. Mr. Saxena is involved in some shady dealings, and when Rohit accidentally witnesses his associates shooting a police officer, the bad guys chase him down on his motorcycle and run him off a bridge. He drowns in the water below, but his body is never recovered.

Mr. Saxena sends the grieving Sonia to live with her uncle in New Zealand, and she meets Raj (also played by Hrithik), who looks exactly like Rohit (except Raj is edgier than her cloying first love). Raj pursues her, even though she literally runs away from him, haunted as she is by memories of Rohit. Raj follows her back to India, where Rohit's enemies target Raj, thinking they didn't finish the job the first time.

Raj does not turn out to be the amnesia-stricken Rohit or his long-lost twin, and kudos to the film for not going in either of those predictable directions. However, there's no explanation for why Raj is identical to Rohit. Even some symbolic reason would have sufficed, but none is given.

There's a lot going on in this movie, and plenty of high drama, and yet, it's not terribly engaging.

2584169,5,B000FSL920,"When we first watch a new (to us) Indian film we just throw the disc in the player and watch the songs first.  First impression was that the music and dancing were very good but the sound is produced on a synthesizer and it took a few minutes to warm up to it and realize it is really okay - perhaps great. There is typical Farah Khan choreography with beautiful dancers dancing beautifully. The ""say you love me"" song has real hooks. My only complaint with the music and dancing is that the big stage dance scene near the end was not well lit, ""smoky"" and could have been shot better to see the dancers more clearly.

It seems like there is always some kind of surprise in these Indian films and this time it is a clipper sailing (cruise) ship that is a sight to behold. A big dance scene happens on the deck of this truly magnificent boat. This boat looks like it is 300 ft long not counting the 50 ft long spar off the bow.

Amisha Patel's beauty, acting and dancing in the movie have been criticized but honestly she is quite good enough with Hrithik as a strong lead. If I were to downgrade this film it would be for the slightly more than brief violence, not Amisha. For overall entertainment quality I give this film a weak 5 for what it is, not for what it isn't.",1258329600,,1271,4.222222222222222
2584170,2,B000FSL920,"This movie is watchable only because of Hrithik Roshan. I wasn't surprised though. I was warned about this movie and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai also starring Hrithik and Amisha was not worth buying. I purchased both anyway because I want to collect all Hrithik Roshan's movies, so it was not a regret or waste of money. Amisha Patel was not easy for me to watch. She was too young, lacked depth, and was a bad dancer. I didn't find her that attractive either. It seems like the extras and dancers were all better looking including the lady flirting with Hrithik on the cruise. It wasn't believable that Hrithik's charater Rohit would fall in love with her. If you have a good character and personality then looks doesn't matter but her character was a hot tempered spoiled brat which didn't help her looks. If this was my first Bollywood film, I would not have become a fan of Bollywood so don't let this be your first! If you have never seen a Bollywood film, there are so many great ones out there to watch first such as Kuch Naa Kaho, Jodhaa Akbar, Straight from the Heart, Devdas, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Dil Ka Rishta, Ashoka, and a great Hindi film ""Black."" Hrithik Roshan was great as always but Amisha Patel didn't deliver like the great female actors I usually watch, such as, Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, and Karisma Kapoor to name a few.",1256601600,2,1371,4.6
2584171,2,B000FSL920,"This movie was only worth watching because of Hrithik Roshan--great talent. He has the ability to turn a horrible script into a semi-masterpiece, if given the right costar...which unfortunately was not the case here.  His costar over-acted throughout the entire movie--she singlehandedly was able to kill whatever life Hrithik was able to give to the script.  I saw her in 2 movies and that was two too many...the other was Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage, also with Hrithik Roshan...Unless you are a huge fan of his and feel the need to watch all his movies, don't bother with these two.",1252713600,,584,4.83
2584172,5,B000FSL920,"This film was the first leading role for both Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel, and it catapulted both actors to Bollywood superstardom.  Like many Hindi films, this one is a family project.  It was written and directed by Hrithik's father, Rakesh Roshan, and the music was composed by Hrithik's uncle, Rajesh Roshan.

Hrithik plays Rohit, a happy-go-lucky orphan who. along with his younger brother, Amit, lives with an aunt and uncle.  Amisha Patel plays Sonia, a sweet but spoiled rich girl.  Sonia is accustomed to getting what she wants, and when she meets Rohit, he immediately becomes one of the things she wants.  The action in the first part of the film contains a lot of the silly antics one might expect to find in a 1960's beach party movie.  But then tragedy strikes, and the entire tone of the film changes.

This movie is in many ways a transitional Bollywood film.  The first half is old style Bollywood, while the second half is new style.  The music and cinematography after the intermission have a much more modern feel than the first half.  The plot is a lot like that of Om Shanti Om, or perhaps it's the other way around, since Kano Naa Pyaar Hai predates Om Shanti Om by around seven years.  The story is about karmic coincidences - things that seem to happen by chance, but are actually a part of a grand cosmic scheme, the design of which is to bring happiness and long life to the innocents (well, most of them, anyway) and justice to the wrongdoers.

This film is quite funny in places and extremely moving in others.  The relationship between the two brothers is particularly touching.  The songs are very good for the most part, and Farah Kahn's choreography is outstanding.  This film also introduces one of Hrithik Roshan's signature dance moves.  If you're a fan either of the stars this film is a must see.",1252540800,,1838,4.640866873065016
2584173,5,B000FSL920,"Thought about doing this review for quite some time, hesitating only because this movie came out like 9 years ago and is kind of hard to find today, but with the interest in Bollywood movies here in the US today I decided to give it a try.

So, here I go--trying to review a Bollywood movie...which runs nearly 3 hours and, unless you speak Hindi, you must watch with subtitles. First, if subtitles are a problem for you, start watching ALL your DVDs with the subtitles turned ON to get you used to the whole subtitle ""thing""--it is good practice but habit forming--to the point you might find yourself looking for them at the movie theatre! Second, give yourself a 3 hour block of time so that you don't have to keep pausing the movie, and third, give the movie time to grow on you. Relax and just go with it--these Bollywood Producers actually cater to their viewers to give them what they want, unlike Hollywood where movies are cut short in order to shorten the running time so as to have more showings in a day. Be prepared for lots of singing and dancing--no matter what the subject matter!!

Now, this movie: Kaho Naa...Pyaar Hai, which means Say you love me..is a love story. The first time I watched it I had absolutely NO idea what it was about or anything--did I mention it was MY first Bollywood? So, here I am, watching what I think if just a romantic comedy about a cute guy (Rohit) who lives with, and supports a brother, aunt and uncle who meets a sweet rich girl(Sonia)and the two are immediately attracted to each other. So, they end up on a cruise ship together when she gets drunk (out of jealously) and the 2 of them end up marooned on an island--some funny scenes and hilarious subtitles here, plus a good song--her Dad rescues the pair and trys to separate the lovers. At this point the hero, Rohit, declares he can and will be successful and support Sonia, so the Dad agrees to a marriage if Rohit is successful. Rohit and friends arrange a concert, which is sold out and if this was a Hollywood movie, that would be the end--and all live happily ever after. Heck, by now the movie has run over 90 minutes...

But, NO!! this is Bollywood, which means the story takes a sudden and sharp turn off the deep end--well, in this case a bridge--other reviews have had spoilers and I don't want to do that, but let me tell you, you do not want to miss what happens next!! I'ver rewatched this movie and it never fails to give me the giggles or make me cry. Sure, it is ""corny"" and a little dated, sentimental and over the top, but I still give it 5 stars because it is a lovely love story, with heart, beautiful people and some good songs*****give it a try, you just might like it--or get hooked on Bollywood like many of us.",1238457600,13,2741,4.381139489194499
2584174,5,B000FSL920,"This movie is really beautiful the story, the music, I love it, and Hrithik is the HOTTEST man in the whole world.",1190332800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2584175,5,B000FSL920,A great movie if you do not put tooo much thought into it.  If you are young at heart and a die hard romatic.... the impossible becomes a possibility.  Hrithik is HOT!!!!  I love to believe that lovers meant to be somehow find their way to eachother.  I love the love song on the beach (tell me that you love me).  I've seen part of this song sang in another one of Hrithik's movies... I thought that it was cool.,1182816000,3,413,4.1125
2584176,4,B000FSL920,"Two young innocents, struggling musican Rohit and rich but good natured Sonia, meet and are attracted to each other. Somehow, they end up on a deserted island and, there, they declare their love. Sonia's father rescues them, but he's got his hate on for Rohit and vindictively causes him to be fired from his job. Rohit vows to make his way up in the world and be on equal terms with Sonia's social standing. Only then will he seek to marry Sonia. But some things aren't meant to be, and, soon, Sonia learns of Rohit's abrupt and shocking drowning.

Her concerned father sends the disconsolate Sonia to gorgeous New Zealand to forget Rohit and to recuperate. Now here comes that Bollywood twist as, instead, she bumps into Raj, someone who looks amazingly like her dead love. Raj falls for Sonia, but she doesn't reciprocate as the sight of him only recalls painful memories of her Rohit. She flees back to India. Raj follows and, in the course of the film, unearths the reason behind Rohit's passing. Now can he win the girl of his dreams? Also, there's some crooked cops.

KAHO NAA...PYAAR HAI is a 2000 blockbuster Bollywood film which first introduced Hrithik Roshan to the world and made him an overnight success. I guess Hrithik's dad, Rakesh Roshan, who directed this flick, knew what he was doing. KAHO NAA...PYAAR HAI won a boatload of Indian Cinema awards, including best actor wins for Hrithik Roshan. Owing to the huge popularity of the film, debuting actress Amisha Patel, who looks like sweetness and light personified, also became, to a lesser extent, an instant ""hot"" commodity. But, certainly, she owes some of her fame to the ""Hrithik factor."" This is an instance where sheer charisma and star power colossally loom over normally more consequential things such as plot and script. Certainly, without the two leads (and specifically Hrithik), the movie wouldn't be all that and a bag of chips. As it is, it's box office bonanza.

The first half of the film indulges in some pretty sappy romantic fluff, which might be terrific for girls but, c'mon, I'm a dude who hopes to grow hair on his chest one day (because you shouldn't give up on your dreams). But I was this close to tossing this one out when, suddenly, the movie became interesting. That would be after an hour and a half, when the scenery changes to New Zealand and the story gains serious momentum as the oh-so-gentle love story turns into a gripping crime drama and chase film.

So, exciting action for the guys. For the girls, a leading man with flashing green eyes, a muscular physique (Bollywood star Salman Khan oversaw his weight training), explosive dancing skills, and one other thing. Boyfriends and male buddies of the female audience might end up loathing this dude (I know I did), but one can't really deny that the man can actually deliver his lines and effectively perform in his dual roles. Amisha Patel, cute and lovable as she is, is still overshadowed by Hrithik.

KAHO NAA...PYAAR HAI is almost three hours long, which gives the movie ample time to plug Coca Cola (could the film sell out even more?). The songs are mostly fun and are, in turns, wistful and hopeful and romantic. When Raj strums the guitar to the strains of Rohit's song, there's a certain recognition there felt by the audience and certainly felt by Sonia. Meanwhile, Hrithik's smooth dancing in the musical numbers is probably what cemented his popularity with the swooning girldom. There's humor throughout the film, but the only two scenes which made me laugh out loud involved a boy with a mustache and Indian comedian Johnny Lever as a policeman caught in the grips of a bathroom dilemma. Poor fella.

Question: is it just me or did Raj recover awfully quickly from his shoulder wound? And, finally, as I was watching the final stages of this film, the cynical side of me couldn't help but wonder how perfectly twisted and cold it'd be if Raj also dies. Now that'd be something. Anyway, as debuts go, Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel do fairly well. In fact, going by the Indian movie goers and the critics' overwhelmingly positive reception toward the film, they do exceedingly well. Ergo, three and a half shot at, flung over a bridge, and drowned stars.",1180310400,18,4226,4.758526603001364

Like the Bourne movies only Bollywood style of course. The only thing I didn't like was the scene in which he was beating the stuffing out of the bad guys and the girl starts yelling at him to kill them, kill them. It was one thing for him to kill them because he was fighting for his life (which he was) but another to kill just to kill. Of course this is a movie and I loved it.

2584257,4,B000FSL920,"Well here, I am with a review for my second Bollywood purchase!  In case anyone finds the title of this review weird, it is a reference to Paul Newman's screen debut in a movie of the same name. I will explain how it fits, please be patient with me. Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai put Hrithik Roshan on the map and started the ""Hrithik Effect"" this phenomenon bumped up tourism for New Zealand, caused riots, and suddenly made a lot of big stars start hitting the gym! Not bad for a guy who had a stammer as a child and then told he would never dance well enough to be a hero in Bollywood films.

In order to enjoy this film you need to be a sap, and have a keen sense of appreciation for the ridiculous. Fortunately, I have both in spades. I am a big believer that in order to enjoy movies you have to accept them for what they are. This movie is not a life changing experience. It does not make you think about any grand question of life, it does not provoke, shock, or make any kid of statement. Its purpose is to give you almost three hours of escapism, mushy romance, and a few giggles. Most of all, it is supposed to make you go nuts for the Leading Man. It did that for me, so I give it four stars; but I am not going to lie, this is hardly a masterpiece of Hindi Cinema.

I am a bit of a geek when it comes to movies I love the whole process. So, things like the production, the direction, the cinematography, are important to me. This is my first Rakesh Roshan film and I have to say there were things that kept nagging at me. The way he shot the film felt odd, I realize that is a vague statement but its true. He captured the gorgeous locations with beautiful sweeping shots, yet the close-ups were shot so tightly that they felt stifling rather than intimate. The action shots were appropriately nerve wracking, but the sound effects people really dropped the ball. I mean I just saw Yash Chopra's Vijay, on Netflix and I find it baffling that the same sound techniques were used in the year 2000 for the fight scenes in this film. In those areas, I have to admit to disappointment.

In the spirit of honesty, I will also admit that Sonia, played by Ameesha Patel does very little for me. Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan had originally been offered the role, and Kareena Kapoor-Kahn, had been signed at first, but she walked out right after shooting began. While I am a huge fan of Ms. Rai-Bachchan and I am absolutely crazy about all of her movies with Hrithik Roshan, I do not blame her for passing on this. Sonia isn`t worthy of her talents. Still, she does make an appearance of a sort. Hrithik Roshan reads an article of Cosmopolitan magazine with her on the cover. I do not know what happened with Kareena Kapoor-Khan, but I wish she had done it. She has the moxie to make characters like Sonia interesting.

This movie was also Ameesha Patel's debut and while she is not a ""bad"" actress, you can tell she is raw. She is beautiful to look at, and she has moments when she is hysterically funny; but when it comes to the heavier emotional scenes, she falls apart. It is a shame, the first half of the movie she is quite fun to watch. Her jealousy over other girls throwing themselves at Rohit is a blast, and she had a great ""isn't she adorable"" quality to her. It is easy to see why Rohit falls for her. Even though Sonia is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, and she makes the guy want to strangle her at times, they fit well. He is adorable, she is adorable, and it makes sense. Why does Raj fall for her? I am trying to figure that one out... during the big climax she takes a side trip to crazy-town! You will just have to see it to believe it.

I do not want you to think that I do not like this movie. In fact, I am glad I bought it and here is why: First, it has Anupam Kher in it! This man is amazing, bad guy, good guy, somewhere-in-between guy, drama, comedy; whatever he is doing, I love him! Seriously, I would buy a movie just because he is in it. He is a very bad guy in this one, worse than the villain he played in Vijay (talk about a trip to crazy-town), yet I cannot help but love him. Of course, it helps that unlike in Vijay the end made sense!

Second, Farida Jalal is in it! I really adore her too; she takes the tiniest roles and burns herself into the film. I loved her as Simran's mother in ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" and it does not matter what I see her in I still love her.

I love how Bollywood is a family affair! The director is the leading man's dad, so it is only fair that the leading lady has some family back up as well. Miss Patel gets hers by her mom who has a bit-part as Raj's mother. I have to say I found their one scene together to be very cute. I am a sentimental girl who loves her mom.

Abhishek Sharma is an adorable munchkin who played Amit, Rohit's little brother. Cute kids by nature are usually scene stealers but this kid has some serious acting chops. His scenes with Hrithik Roshan alone make the movie worth paying for.

Of course, even with all these good reasons to see the movie you really only need one. Hrithik Roshan. Despite this movie's flaws, it's his movie and he carries it with the same professionalism he has today. Taking on a dual role, in a first film as an adult in a leading role takes guts and commitment. He has more than enough of both and it showed. Is it his best work? No. Is it his best dancing? No. Is it a triumphant performance? Yes. Why? Simple, it makes the film do what it's meant to do: entertain you for just under three hours with escapism, mushy romance, a few giggles, and make you fall in love with the leading man.

Why compare this movie with Paul Newman's debut in, ""The Silver Chalice?"" Well, it wasn't Paul Newman's best work and not even sap and a keen appreciation for the ridiculous could make it entertaining yet he became a legend. This movie might not be a masterpiece, but fifty years from now when Hrithik Roshan is a legend at least he won't have a ""The Silver Chalice"" on his filmography.

The DVD has one little thing that bugged me, the logo of the company that released the DVD Eros is in the top left hand corner of the picture. I think they do it to avoid pirating which as we all know is a serious problem. There are no real special features, just previews. But don't let that deter you, I think what I got is well worth the price.",1350950400,5,6347,4.206244864420706
2584258,5,B000FSL920,"Rakesh Roshan's 2000 Kaho Naa ... Pyaar Hai : you can look it up!
I have about 30 Bollywood DVD sets, but this one has the amazing special features disk about the Bollywood Filmfare Awards night staging.  For a parody see Farah Khan's 2007 Om Shanti Om DVD.
Yet this movie has New Zealand vacationland shots, and a very optimistic take on contemporary Eurasian youthful lifestyle.  Which is very cleancut, and hard for parody, except maybe in Maneesh Sharma's 2011 Ladies vs Ricky Bahl DVD.
I watch these DVDs, while improving My-Indi'glish accents ...

2584260,2,B000FSL920,"I don't even know where to begin on this one. I love Hindi films, and I own many, but this one is just ridiculous. Way over the top. Every scene seems contrived, and there's so much poor acting. Clearly there's no accounting for differences, so try it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1336435200,,297,4.228070175438597
2584261,4,B000FSL920,"I envisioned something a little bit different when I read the movie preview, so when it didn't play out that way I was left reeling with the feeling. Don't miss understand me, it's a good movie. I've watched mine twice now, but I still can't get over Rohit. I just knew they would pull a rabbit out of their hat and that's how the movie would go. Yet, they went a little more logical way. The songs were good and my extra features disc was neat in that Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel commentated their remarks in English, only Hrithik's dad didn't so I have no idea really what he was saying.",1330560000,3,593,4.303571428571429
2584262,5,B000FSL920,"What an interesting story of mistaken identity and and then taking action to go after those who killed the guy who looks like you.  This movie was filmed in India and New Zealand so you know you're gonna get a great visual treat if anything else.  Plus look at these two very popular absolute gorgeous actors: Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel.  I have alot of Bollywood films on DVD, and this is one of those DVD's that I watch at least once a year.  For a nearly three hour movie, it never seems to drag.  Entertaining all the way through.

But, I generally watch Bollywood films because I love to watch good looking people on film.  A good story is only secondary as my intention to be entertained.

If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:

First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.
The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.
Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.
About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.
About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.
One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)

So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.  Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray.  The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.

Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is ""Ghulam"" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan.  Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying.  Check it out!",1321142400,3,2825,4.540433925049309
2584263,5,B000FSL920,"I loved this movie soooooo much!!!  I have already watched it several times.  Hrithik Roshan does great playing two totally different characters.  I could watch it again and again.  Loved the music.  And the dance scene, especially the one in the club was spectacular!!!  If you like Hrithik Roshan, this is a must see!!!  Not only is he the most gorgeous guy I have ever laid eyes on, but he is an extremely talented dancer and actor.  I don't like too many action flicks, but this movie kept me captivated. What I love about Bollywood movies as opposed to Hollywood, is that they are so clean.  They are far more romantic than most Hollywood movies without all the sex. This movie is no exception.",1310860800,49,699,4.57258064516129

Once again he plays 2 entirely different characters in the same movie and you love both of them. I was afraid that I would not like Raj chasing Rohit's girl, but I was happy that Rohit was able to bring them together by the end of the movie. I love Bollywood movies. Hollywood has almost forgotten how to tell a good love story, but thankfully Bollywood hasn't.",1303776000,23,447,4.463414634146342
2584266,5,B000FSL920,"This is honestly on of the best Bollywood movies ever made. Literally had tears. So the story might be hard to believe, but it's not much different than Western films that are hard to believe. Just buy it, watch it, and you'll love it. Hrithik Roshan is one of my favorite actors. The only thing about this movie is on the cover it said there would be bonus features like interviews with Hrithik and Amisha Patel, but when you click it on the screen, it says please enter disc 2. There never was a disc 2 nor was the cover made for 2 discs. Either way still a great movie, I highly recommend you buying it.",1296259200,29,606,4.232758620689655

For Hrithik's first shot as a leading man he is marvelous.  His costar does a good job as well.  Hrithik carried the film!  THis movie was done so long ago and already he looks like a super star - he's  natural actor.  But after listening to interviews since this movie was made, it's obvious he works hard at his craft. The states could use an actor of his caliber - done in English of course.  He is handsome but exudes goodness in the inside.  He is a blessing to watch.",1507420800,,618,4.083333333333333
