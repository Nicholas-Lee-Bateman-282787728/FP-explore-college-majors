8352132,4,B002665I7Q,"Howard Goodall takes us on another fun and educational musical journey, this time focusing on what is often referred to as the ""king of instruments"", whether it's in a cathedral, a theater, a private home, or a department store.  His journey's through Europe are particularly interesting, visiting churches or castles with organs that thankfully have been kept in working condition and that may have been played by the old masters.  The fact that Howard gets to play them as well will make some players very jealous.  The theater organ lovers amongst us get slighted a bit, but only because of time and timing.  We do get to see the famed keyboard (and works) of the Blackpool Tower organ, which for a show produced in England is a must.  But on Howard's trip to America, here's where the timing comes in.  The show starts off at the United Center in Chicago, showing how the organ is a part of the experience when attending a hockey game.  But oh how great it would have been if the show was done a few years before, when we could have seen the magnificent Barton organ that was in Chicago Stadium!  And if the show was done a few years later, I'm sure he would have made a stop in Mesa, Arizona to see the largest Wurlitzer, at Organ Stop Pizza.  But the show concludes, appropriately, with the Wanamaker Organ in Philly, the largest working theater organ (I add ""working"" to avoid arguments about the Boardwalk Hall organ in Atlantic City, which sadly is in need of much repair).  So sit back, crank up the speakers, and enjoy.",1277942400,2,1530,4.571428571428571
8352133,5,B002665I7Q,"Throught the four programmes {97 minutes} that make up ""Howard Goodall's Organ Works"" one is taken through a wonderful interesting documentary, with humour, about the King of Instruments. From the earliest beginnings, the development, on location in Europe and the USA, up to the question of what will future instruments be like.
This DVD is suitable for anyone interested in organs. Originally made for television in 1997, it will not date, well not for the next twenty years at least. It will keep your attention and be informative as well.
A must for the library of those who like the organ {classical, street, theatre, or popular}
Also check out ""Howard Goodall's Big Bangs"" and ""Howard Goodall's Choir Works"".
{I can't wait until ""Howard Goodall's Big Dates"" is released on DVD}",1250726400,4,783,5.030769230769231
