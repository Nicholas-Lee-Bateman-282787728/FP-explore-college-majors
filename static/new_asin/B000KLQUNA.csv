2693287,3,B000KLQUNA,I was disappointed with the dvd because the actual tv show plays 3 regular songs througout each episode and the DVD cuts these songs out.  I purchased the DVD for the sole reason of having these songs available because this is what my child enjoys.,1172448000,10,248,4.511111111111111
2693288,5,B000KLQUNA,This is a wonderful show for kids of all ages.  My son is 15 months old. He loves music. This program has lots of great songs.

8157976,5,B000KLQUNA,Personally these are hands down the best shows on pbs... I remember watching these with my oldest son now eight when he was a tiny baby.. The music and characters drew all of us so much I memorized that birthday song for his first birthday and to this day still sing it him. Broke our hearts when they cancelled it. Now we can show his 14 mo old brother and he's getting into then add much as the rest of the family . Truly a great find and if you do buy it!!,1393977600,,459,3.946236559139785
