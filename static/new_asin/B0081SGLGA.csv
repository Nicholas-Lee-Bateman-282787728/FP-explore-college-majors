It begins in a small town; Church to-day is the sign posted on the saloon. Services begin for the men. The minister says sheep men will arrive. His sermon is against hate and bitterness. The government will allow sheep men and homesteaders into the Laramie Basin. Thompson objects to this, the Sheriff explains the law. Ken and his brother Wally go to the restaurant where theres a new waitress. Wally flips a coin. A crowd gathers outside, a sheepherder will drive his sheep through town. Ken and Wally will try to change their route. They stop a rider, he is a she! The sheep owner is offered help in herding.

Wally buys womens clothes for Judy at the store. Ken arrives to ask for flannel underwear, then switches a note on a package! Thompson orders men to keep the sheep herds away from his lands. His sons go to see their angry father. Butch Martin plans something bad for the herd of sheep. Miss Judy rides into town (without a hat). Wally learns of the trick. A gang rides out and drives the sheep away. The owner shoots at them but is shot! His wagon is pushed down a hill. Goldie dances with Wally. Judy hears the bad news about her father. Mr. Thompson offered his home to Judy. She goes riding with Ken, but Wally replaces him.

The Sheriff tells about Butch, he has a big roll and brags about getting rid of the sheepherder Winters. Ken takes him to see his father; Judy overhears Butchs talk and leaves. Later Ken meets Judy and asks her to return. Ken takes the blame and tells Judy he is leaving the area. Butch talks to turn Wally against Ken. Wally shoots Ken then leaves to attack the sheepmen. When Wally hesitates, Butch shoots him! Butch and his gang attack the sheepmens camp. There is shooting. Ken and his men stop them; Ken captures Butch and turns him over to the Sheriff. Judy talks to Wally. Ken will have a happy future.

There are lessons in this story about proper behavior. Did you note them? Ken has the skills to resolve conflicts peacefully, but others do not. Note how Wallys drinking affected his judgment. The problem with sheep is they crop the grass down to the ground so cattle cannot feed afterwards. It is less expensive to raise sheep than cattle. Sheep produce wool, a renewable resource. Cattle only make one harvest of hides. Many prefer beef to mutton.",1509494400,,2335,4.5260663507109005
