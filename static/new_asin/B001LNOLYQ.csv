8319155,3,B001LNOLYQ,"One of the weaker Tom Mix talking pictures, this movie was originally intended for Hoot Gibson.  It was released December 22, 1932 when Mix was age 52.  His co-star, cute Ruth Hall, turned 22 on December 29.  She had starred with John Wayne in 'Ride Him, Cowboy' a few months earlier.  In 1931 she was the female second lead in 'Monkey Business' with the Marx Brothers.  Hall died in 2003 at age 92.  It's a shame someone did not interview her about her early roles with Mix and Wayne.

In my opinion, the story of 'Flaming Guns' is ridiculous.  William Farnum is over the top in his histrionics and seems to have much more on-screen time than does Mix.  The plot has Farnum seemingly having Tom Mix thrown in jail at will, with the sheriff and police jumping to his command just because he doesn't like Mix.

The movie was filmed in the Alabama Hills near Lone Pine, California. There are some excellent scenes of Mix riding Tony Jr. with the snow capped Sierra Nevada mountains in the background.  In one chase scene, Tom Mix leaps from his horse to knock the bad guy from his horse.  The scene is close enough to see that it really was Tom doing the stunt.  Overall, the movie is one of the slower Mix films, without a lot of action.  Tom's reactions are more often the pantomime facial expressions he learned in the silent movies when there was no dialogue and it was necessary to emphasize facial expressions.

The movie is full-length at 57 minutes, but why can't any Tom Mix movie, from any distributor, have a nice clear image?  The negatives of all the Tom Mix movies for Universal were destroyed in a fire.  I still have a letter in the late 1960s from an official at Universal stating so.  But have no decent-quality films turned up?  The best picture quality I have seen of Tom Mix is in the three Castle Home Movies that were transferred to DVD for the boxed set, 'Cowboy Heroes of the Silver Screen' put out by Marathon Music and Video in 2004.  Those three condensed movies run about eight minutes each and have nice images.  (Guns of Vengeance, Terror Trail, and The King and the Cowboy)

The picture quality of this DVD is about average for any other Tom Mix movie I have seen.  If you're a Tom Mix fan you're not going to beat the price.  Recommended.",1409097600,,2269,4.451456310679611

8319157,3,B001LNOLYQ,Great fun old time B movie western. Tom Mix set the standard for unflappable good guy. A real cowboy playing a cowboy.,1379462400,2,118,4.409090909090909
8319158,5,B001LNOLYQ,"One of six Tom Mix sound films made for Universal in 1933, Flaming Guns is an excellent B Western and this print is very good! I'd seen all existing Tom Mix films but this one and it's terrific to now own it. Tom is in his prime here, and at age 53 he looks 33. He rides, ropes and shoots in high style. All of the B Western regulars are here, including Hal Taliaferro and William Farnum as the tycoon. This is one of my faves, now. That's a fact! After seeing this film, packaged and distributed by Sinister Cinema, I went to their website and bought a dozen other rare B's.",1361923200,2,575,4.142857142857143
8319159,5,B001LNOLYQ,"Tom and the West are pictured here in great scenes that call to mind all the stunning glitter of his many publicity shots. Flaring Chaps, dashing ten-gallon hats, blazing six guns, and the wonder horse Tony with a wonderful background of western scenery: sagebrush, mountains, prairies, rocky buttes, and wide open spaces.",1359331200,,322,5.211538461538462
8319160,3,B001LNOLYQ,"Unfortunately the name ""Tom MIx"" isn't that well known today except to the older generation as the majority of his films were made in the silent era with only nine ""sound"" movies however, in the 300 plus movies he did make he became the first major western ""Mega Star"" that set the pattern for all westerns to follow in dress and action. Tom Mix toured the world several times and was loved by millions of kids as well as adults and there was even a radio program that was still aired ten years after his death in 1940. By todays standards of westerns the Mix formula of good over bad, using fists instead of guns or a rope are passe but his films were directed to entertain the youth with lots of action and expert horsemanship and stunts. Its too bad we lost the simple values of those old westerns that proivided great entertainment and gave us heros to emulate.",1329523200,7,865,4.4125
8319161,4,B001LNOLYQ,"Tom Mix Flaming Guns is a very fine picture from the good old thirties. It is funny, almost a western comedy and all the persons in big and small roles play with high energy. The title is not good though, there is not much gun play.",1293494400,2,232,4.065217391304348
