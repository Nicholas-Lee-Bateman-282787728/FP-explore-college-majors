2399715,3,B000B5871I,"This Yin Yoga DVD set contains a great description of the theory/principles of the Yin Yoga practice. The audio/verbal cues are clear, concise, and easy to follow. However, I would recommend this Yoga for experienced practitioners ONLY. The poses are defintiely not suitable for those just beginning to explore the wonderful benefits of yoga. (The poses are held too long for beginners.)",1161043200,14,387,5.258064516129032
2399716,5,B000B5871I,"The DVD goes into great detail regarding the what, why and how or Yin yoga.  This is an excellent resource for learning the practice.

2399717,5,B000B5871I,"I have studied fascial anatomy and was well aware of the importance of connective tissue releasing the skeletal structure. I was excited to learn about this form of yoga from a close friend. She praised it so much that I had to experience it for myself. I am grateful for the tip. The lecture portion is so important to have full understanding of the long holding of the asanas. It is amazing to feel the fascia melt and the body release into the posture. For me the time moves quickly. The more I do this practice I can feel my body holding the joint mobility longer and longer throughout the day.

I saw a review that stated it hurt the back. This person must not have been listening to their own body or to Paul's specific advice of moving slowly into the practice, following the cues of your body. Some days I can sink right in, other days I have to hold back, wait and breathe. As long as I listen to my own level of discomfort in each session I end up feeling lighter in body and mind by the end of the series, both the hip and spine series.",1160956800,26,1047,4.208955223880597
2399718,1,B000B5871I,"This DVD really hurt my back.  I did the easier of the Yin workouts and my back hurt for two days.  I would not recommend this dvd.

2399719,4,B000B5871I,"Paul Grilley's discussion of the meridian theory and it's application to holding poses is very intriguing and worth listening to. He is very good presenter and elucidates his ideas and those of his teacher's very well. Yin Yoga, as Grilley works with it is not the same as the restorative Yoga of the Inyengar style, although it has things in common with that practise.

The practise parts on the second DVD have in my opinion many  good and some negatives.

Good: Yin sequences that are related in many ways to classical Hatha Yoga and also modern Pilates with models demonstrating varying flexibility capacities with Grilley's verbage emphasizing the result instead of ""aesthetics"" of asana practise. He emphasizes the truth that each body will experience an asana differently depending on muscular and sketetal structure. The 3 short additional Yin practises with cues only is very helpful. Option for music only is also a nice feature.

.

Negatives: Yang section is not Hatha Yoga, so the practisioner has to learn something new  to use that part of the practise. This may be a positive for some people, but was not for me. Grilley is slowly but surely conceding to popular taste by using models in the Infant Series and the 3 short Yin practices with only the hyperflexible slender and attractive women (Yoga Journal perfect) doing the poses beyond the capacities of most practisioners with no model demonstrating options for the rest of us. So Grilley is not totally ""walking his talk"" about results over aesthetic.

For those yogi's and yogini's who like to stay on top of current trends in American Yoga will want to give Grilley a hearing.",1144108800,38,1649,4.910071942446043
2399720,5,B000B5871I,"Paul Grilley has made a name for himself as one of the most vocal proponents of correctly understanding the role of Anatomy in a yoga practice.  Now, in Yin Yoga, he blows the roof off some cherished concepts in exercise science in a lucid exposition that is dead on, charismatically delivered, and utterly fascinating.  And that's not even getting into the practice part of things!

Pranayama and Paul appear to have formed a partnership where the major winner is the Yoga practitioner.  This 2 DVD set is split into two foci: Theory and Practice.  The theory section deals primarily with expounding the logic behind the Yin Yoga approach.  ""Yin"" Yoga focuses on long holds with relaxed muscles; the focus is to stretch ligament and fascia while providing gentle pressure on the joints.  Again, one can hear the tortured cried of the exericse physiologists and kinesiologists: how can you honestly say it's alright to stress the joints?  What unfolds in a roughly hour and 3/4 lecture is the most lucid and accurate explanation of why this is the best idea ever.  And without giving too much away, the whammy at the end is well set-up, and an utterly new way of seeing into the role of ligament and fascia in keeping the body physically and energetically well.

The lecture CD also contains a demontration of Yang forms -- those that work the muscles.  These are complemented by the Yin forms demonstrated on Disc 2.  There is approximately 5 hours of practice material, between master classes and slideshow presentations of practices.  The Yin practices are a little bizarre when approached from the standard, Krisnamacharya vinyasa perspective.  The first shot in the first practice is of Paul sitting like an ancient Kung Fu master with a stopwatch.  But, from there, the practice unfolds with a Zen like elegance.  It is certainly true that not everyone will find success with this practice on the first try.  As Paul explains on the first DVD, the very fact that we struggle with practice is indicative of the fact that we MUST continue to do it!  Yin Yoga is a practice of patience, and it will resonate well with some, and as antithetical to others.

As always, Pranamaya's DVDs will first appeal to those who are fascinates with theory-in-practice, and may already be ""into"" the larger picture of Yoga beyond the physical aspects of asana.  But there is much here that can be appreciated by a wide range of practitioners and backgrounds -- not the least are exercise scientists and physiologists who may need to cast off the shackles of early 20th century thinking.  In summary, a superlative effort that royally pays off on many levels.",1129593600,123,2646,4.848552338530067
2399721,5,B000B5871I,"Before I saw this dvd, or got to know Paul Grilley's work, I had an established dynamic (or Yang) practice. As Paul repeatedly mentions, a quiet (or Yin) practice is highly beneficial and complimentary to my existing vinyasa practice.

Watching, doing, and enjoying, the material on this dvd is like finding a hidden key and I recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in exploring the hidden depths of true yoga.

It is truly rich resource for any student or teacher of yoga.",1125878400,22,482,4.726190476190476
2399722,5,B000B5871I,"This may seem like a lot to spend on a yoga DVD, but you get so much for your money. It's well worth it.

It's a 2-set DVD.

The first DVD is lecture on theory on Yin Yoga, learning the yang sequences, and special features including biographies, demonstration performances, and more. Paul Grilley is an excellent presenter. He explains in a very clear, complete, and sometimes humorous way the theory behind Yin Yoga. Yin yoga works on your connective tissue and not so much muscular stretching like other yogas.

The second DVD includes the practice and has three one-hour Yin practices: hip series, spine series, and infant series. All practice is done on the floor and you hold the postures for up to five minutes to work on your connective tissues. It is a much different practice than traditional yoga. You will feel your body and bones open up. I love these practices and Yin yoga is a great way to balance out vinyasa or bikram yoga practices (Yang). For each of these 3 practices you have two choices of audio: either indepth instruction or just queues. What a great idea! Once you know the practices you won't normally want to listen over and over to the detailed instructions and this option allows you to do that. Paul leads the instruction in a very pleasant and complete manner.

Also included on the practice DVD are three Yang practices running about 2 minutes each. These are a beautifual mix on vinyasa style yoga and tai chi. You have the options to loop each one individually or sequence-repeat in any order you like. This is a lovely way to customize your workout to whatever your energy level is for any given day.

The final practice on the DVD is four routines with still photos and queues. Again you can mix and match how you want. This is lovely way to make your own practice without distraction of a class room setting.

My acupuncturist recommended this style of yoga and I was so happy to find this DVD. It has balanced out my home practice and my Bikram yoga practice. The producers of this DVD have done a fabulous job of designing the interactive screens. I only wish they would have added some light music in the background, but you can always have a CD player at hand to add your own. Paul Grilley instructions are very clear and soothing and his students demonstrate for both beginning, intermediate, and advanced practice. Suzee Grilley demonstrates the advanced postures and she radiates them beautifully.

I highly recommend this DVD for everyone. Please, also see my other yoga DVD reviews on Amazon.",1125878400,250,2538,4.677130044843049
2399723,3,B000B5871I,"Good but geared more toward advanced practice.  I'm intermediate and find the poses intimidating with less focus on modifications.

2399724,5,B000B5871I,"I had to weigh in on this being a potentially life changing DVD based on the clear and inspiring lecture on Disk 1 and Disk 2 practices. I almost
didn't buy this after reading some negative reviews about the lecture, but I'm so glad I did. I am further inspired to incorporate more yin into my practice and teaching. This is not a standard yoga DVD and let's face it, yin is just not exciting to watch--by definition it is the hidden yin part that is exciting. If you are interested in learning yin--make this part of your library! Aside from the lecture, the yang sequences performed by his wife (sorry the name just left me) is worth the whole ""price of admission"" for the beauty and inspiration alone. Namaste
I am adding a note after a year of use. Still a personal favorite--I am still learning from this DVD! I had some trouble with the practice DVD ""pixilating"" and stopping occasionally. Pranamaya graciously replaced it! Thank you very much. People appreciate this kind of customer service.",1464307200,9,999,4.649717514124294

I am fairly new to yoga and would consider myself a beginner. Many of the reviews in here say that this DVD is not for beginners. I agree. I can't do all of the poses and those I can do, I certainly cannot hold them for 5 minutes. I will, however, continue to try to build up to it. I found the information provided about the science behind Yin and Yang Yoga fascinating. That is what will keep me coming back to this DVD. I would say to anyone considering this, get the DVD for the information. Buy yourself another DVD that is easier to get you started (which is what I plan to do) and then try to work your way up to the sessions offered on this DVD.",1462924800,3,771,3.948717948717949

2399727,2,B000B5871I,"Though I found the first DVD on the background, anatomy, and yin theory very helpful and educational I did not like the practice sessions on the 2nd DVD.  I have been doing Yin Yoga for over a year, getting great benefits, increasing my flexibility and strength but found this practice to be totally unlike the classes I have enjoyed in person.  For anyone with who has some limitations, maybe a bad knee or lower back issues,  I would not recommend this as the majority of shapes revolve around placing you knee in a position which could aggravate an injury or limitation or just not be able to bend in ways he has demonstrated.  He should be giving alternatives or options if you can't do the shapes in the series otherwise you have to wait it out until he moves on to another shape.  I guess if the participant was very advanced this might be fine for you but then you wouldn't need a DVD.  If one wants to do yin practice sessions I would recommend Bernie Clark's videos.",1459555200,4,975,4.449438202247191

2399729,3,B000B5871I,"I was on the fence on how to review this DVD Set. One thing I did like very much about this Set was the excellent lecture on Yin Yoga. The theory part DVD 1 was very good. However, I am not new to Yin Yoga and have bought two other DVDS on Yin and have taken several classes. Never have been disappointed in the other two DVDS nor classes that I have taken, I was surprised how disappointed I was with this set of practices. While the expertise of Paul is clear, this is not - in my opinion - a good DVD practices for beginners. These are practices and a product that should be advertised for people who have more advanced experience and/or flexibility particularly the practice for the HIPS. The spine practice was more traditional. Had this been my first DVD on Yin Yoga, I would have been discouraged and likely not have continued with Yin Yoga.",1450051200,16,848,4.339622641509434

I'm ordering it again b/c THIS is really a quality yoga presentation. I look forward to seeing the 1st disc of the series to learn the essential premise of this very valuable form of yoga.

The series uses 4 people to show different body types and movements which is very helpful to see when first learning.
There is a talk through the postures series and series with more music and less talking, good for those that have learned the poses and don't want the word for word instruction.
The 1st DVD is basically a wonderful overview of what Yin Yoga is and what it is doing for your body, mind, and Spirit. He does go into some great details that are very informative.
The 2nd DVD offers several different series for spine or hips.

Very Good information although in my opinion could use some editing.  The lecture is done by the instructor using the tool of a flip chart which can be effective in a classroom. For a video I would expect at a minimum editing to include graphics of key points, or fade in and out of the speaker during lecture to keep it moving.  Honestly wish I could get my money back being it freezes so much.  It was attempted on 3 different computers.",1368144000,5,575,4.428571428571429

I have other tapes -- including Sarah Powers' (whose voice is so annoying I have to turn her off) -- and this one is the best.  Grilley is the ""father"" of yin yoga, coining the phrase a decade ago.  He offers three great  practices plus others you can customize from slides.  His voice is soothing and the information, very educational.  Best of all, he offers alternatives and modifications for most moves based on different body types and limitations.  When I started doing this DVD, I had nerve problems with my hands and the beginning of arthritis in my neck.  Now, my flexibility is amazing and I feel great. You need to come out of these poses carefully, but if you stick with it, amazing things happen. The only thing I wish is that he would do more of these -- one with practices for each meridian and/or to correspond with chakras.",1362700800,8,967,4.522988505747127

Paul explains very well and the hour goes fast.  I don't do a couple poses- saddle and snail.  Saddle because I am not flexible enough and snail because I have a herniated cervical disc.  As a substitute for saddle, I sit upright on folded legs and for snail I do a seated forward bend.  I highly recommend.",1360540800,3,560,4.036363636363636

I was suffering with hip pain due to trochanteric bursitis, pisiform is syndrome, and hip flexor issues. After just 5 weeks of doing the hip and spine series on this DVD, my pain is essentially gone. The knowledge of anatomy and variations in positions for each posture is outstanding. Would highly recommend as an addition to anyone who has a workout program that already has cardio and strength on board. This is nirvana for flexibility!",1358812800,5,515,4.797752808988764

I sought out yin yoga because my flexibility diminished after an injury and I sat around too long
waiting for it to heal. I was unsuccessful with standard stretching and realized my connective tissue was too stubborn to let go.
Enter Yin Yoga. Paul Grilley does a great job guiding you through these poses. If you have tightness in your back and/or hips,
the results are wonderful.

I do recommend a yoga bolster for yin yoga so you can be supported while relaxing into a pose.
The less flexible you are, the fatter the bolster.",1357689600,,551,4.565656565656566
2399802,4,B000B5871I,"The discovery of yin yoga was a watershed moment for me. I had done other styles, but yin yoga helps relieve myofascial tension and pain, something which no other exercise I've ever done has managed. I've given copies to friends with chronic pain. What I've learned from this DVD has formed my daily practice.

The DVD is well-filmed, and has an essential feature, you can set it to show the movements without most of the voice over dialog.

Paul Grilley gives great instruction, but he also gives a lot of it. He seems to fall into a trap I've seen with other instructors, which is to feel that he needs to fill the time with words. On a DVD that is somewhat understandable, and I do feel that what he says is worth listening to once or twice. Thankfully the feature on the DVD means you only have to listen to it once or twice.

The only real criticism I have of the DVD is that the subjects of the film do not actually span the spectrum of flexibility that most of the viewers do. Even the men are relatively flexible, which means that Paul doesn't give appropriate adjustments to certain poses for people who aren't flexible. It is of less use for those who are just barely able to touch their toes.",1356912000,4,1203,4.385650224215246

2399805,5,B000B5871I,"This video is very informative and the practice part of it is very well made, giving the practioner plenty of instruction.

2399807,5,B000B5871I,"I can not exactly explain why this DVD is so addictive, but I've found myself watching other instructors and thinking: ""Paul could explain it better..."" This is a great option for a newbie to yoga, and it works nicely for an intermediate level/daily practitioner's needs. Keep in mind that a ""yin practice"" is intended to supplement a traditional ""flow"" practice (he calls it yang). In the majority of the sequences you are quiet, still and going deeper into poses intended to stretch the connective tissue around your joints to ultimately strengthen them.
His pace and his down to earth treatment of the subject matter is interesting and always encouraging. If money were no object, I'd be on a plane to Japan to study with he and his incredibly flexible partner and wife, Suzee, in person. He's been doing this work for decades, and his name now represents the hallmark of Yin Yoga. I also own the accompanying book ""Yin Yoga: Outline of a Quiet Practice"" (usually serves as a loaner to friends interested in learning about the technique) and I've just ordered his Anatomy DVD. If you have the patience to go slow and deep into poses, and the discipline to stick with the practice, this DVD will be a great addition to your home library.",1347321600,5,1239,4.7407407407407405

Learning the balance between Yin and Yang Yoga gave me confidence to know that anyone  can do proper and safe Yoga, Paul explains Anatomy limitations so that each of us with our different shapes and sizes are able to gain a proper balance in our body and our well being.

2399812,5,B000B5871I,"I really like this practice and these DVDs and I would highly recommend them to anyone!!... though it's not at all what I was expecting when I ordered them. I'm used to doing high intensity exercise, and I've always thought of stretching as being kind of a break - so when I looked at the box cover and the smiling model student, I thought to myself, ""This is going to be a series of awesome, easy stretches!"" - and instead it has been REALLY challenging, but in a good way. :) :) This is an exercise that you feel, and if you are like me, it will make you really excited about making progress. :) :) Doing this day in and day out, I've definitely noticed improvements in my flexibility and I'm also much more aware of my body and it's alignment throughout the day.

I think these DVDs do a good job of showing different body types doing the exercises and it does give some helpful modifications, but it's not like a typical exercise DVD where there is a mix of skill levels - so it's possible that you may find yourself needing more modifications than you are given. If that's the case, you may want to check out Sarah Power's Insight Yoga. It's an excellent book in it's own right, but I've found it to be a great supplement to these DVDs because it gives a huge number of modifications (and alternate poses) and it has really helped take the guess work out of how to do some of these poses without stressing my sensitive knees.",1335571200,2,1430,4.335820895522388

The Yin practices are excellent,  yeah, Paul talks alittle too much, having the option to play alternative audio ""is great"" . The Yang practises are also well done, choices to each sequence with multiple times(1-5) and the option combine all with custom sequences. The Bonus Yin practices in slides format are also good alternatives.",1321401600,,387,4.953846153846154
2399816,5,B000B5871I,Just finished watching the lecture and had to check in with a review. Paul G is extremely articulate and passionate about Yin yoga. Initially he might seem a little repetitive but once past that it is a captivating and informative class I highly recommend to both yoga teachers and students to better understand and therefore gain respect and motivation for your practive. Bravo - Excellent!!,1316995200,,392,5.046153846153846
2399827,3,B000B5871I,"Paul Grilley is not short on knowledge...the problem basically is his transmission of it.  Granted his presentation skills could be a bit more polished (not always adept at the paperboard...) and he tends to repeat, then reword and then recapitulate and 10 minutes later remind you of what he said.  Argh!  About 20 minutes could easily have been edited out of the theory section (the 1st DVD).  Furthermore, I do not understand why the Yang sequences were tacked on to a Yin yoga DVD.  I can really find them elsewhere with much more complete advice on how to move into and out of a pose. They are a combination of Vinyasa flow and Tai Qi with different names tacked on to the postures.  What he calls 'Sleeping Swan' looks a lot like Pigeon Pose to me.

The 2nd DVD is better.  Again, he is a bit long-winded with the commentaries but since each pose is meant to be held for about 5 minutes, I guess he feels that he has to keep on talking.  He DOES at times have interesting points to make but I agree with the reviewer about the choice of his practitioners.  The young women can bend and stretch themselves like rubber bands...well, that's just great but it's a little hard to identify with them.  It would have been much more interesting to take an overweight person or a middle-aged person and then examine...what alternatives are available when you CAN'T get your forearms down to the floor on a wide-angle forward bend.  (Granted, once or twice he slips a bolster to one of the men).

There are things to learn from these DVDs and I will certainly practice with the Yin yoga sequences at the end and will do so more safely...listening more carefully to my body.  It just takes a lot of patience to sit through it all.",1313884800,35,1725,4.487179487179487
2399828,5,B000B5871I,Just finished watching both DVDs.  Very informative and easy to follow.  Second DVD with the class practice are great for home practice and using them to crete your own sequence.,1313020800,,178,4.9
2399829,4,B000B5871I,"If you are generally well fit, this is probably a non-issue. But for those who have a problem with putting their feet and legs way over their head with all of their weight resting on their shoulders, you may find that many (but all) of the poses are too advanced for you, even with the modifications provided. It's frustrating when you can't do a pose, especially if that pose is something you are supposed to hold for a good 5 minutes.

Yet I really actually like this dvd, as the poses I can do feel so good to perform. I thought he was very informative and that this is a very fresh (and logical) approach to fitness. I think it will change many people's minds on how they perceive their joints.

I would really be very happy if he made a DVD that was for the true beginner, one that also focused on the knees. (That is obviously a big problem area for many of us!) I'd buy that in a heartbeat, THEN work up to this dvd. I hope to see more from Paul.",1309478400,7,953,4.145945945945946
2399830,3,B000B5871I,"I like the actual yoga practice part of this, but I'm put off by Grilley's guru trip, and also mixing Chinese taoist theories with yoga practice.  He does little qi gong exercises along with the yoga, and so forth.  I don't know.  I can't hold these poses for as long as they do either which is my problem, not theirs.  It doesn't feel like a DVD I'll be using regularly.",1309132800,4,371,4.257142857142857
2399831,5,B000B5871I,"This yin yoga DVD was recommended to me by a fellow back pain sufferer.  I had no idea how yin yoga differed from yang yoga, and I was surprised by the price for a 2 DVD package, but I bailed in on my friend's advice.  I am so thankful I did.

I began by listening to the lecture/theory DVD first.  Grilley explains the theory of yin so well that I was a believer before I even started the practice.  The first time I did the spine DVD my sciatica started getting better. My physician had wanted me to go through a course of NSAIDs and physical therapy, but I was so encouraged by my rapid improvement that I decided to forego treatment and give the yin yoga a couple weeks.  Within 3 weeks of doing the yin every other day, my sciatica is about 99% cured.  Amazing!

People have complained in the reviews that Grilley talks too much, and he does talk almost constantly.  Up until now, I have appreciated the advice he gives, but I have done the practice long enough that I, too, am getting tired of his voice. Fortunately, there is an alternative audio option which plays music.  With this option, Grilley talks the students into position, and then, music is dubbed over his voice.  So, there is 30 seconds to a minute of instruction, and then, about 3 to 4 minutes of music while the position is being held.

Another criticism has been that the introduction is overlong and you can't skip it.  An aggravation to be sure, but I just turn on the DVD ahead of time.  When I'm ready to workout, it is at the menu.

I consider this to be one of the most valuable purchases that I have made for my health and well-being.",1306972800,19,1616,4.304635761589404
2399832,5,B000B5871I,"After Sara Powers and Kim Eng dvds I went back to this one.  NOW  I get it and love it.  The talking (instruction) helps me stay focused; my mind does not wander all over.  It has become a regular for me.

I previously published this review after trying the dvd one time and just could not get through the talking.  He talks non-stop through out the entire dvd.  Could not stand that. Much more to my liking is the dvd with Kim Eng.",1300060800,3,432,4.132530120481928

A VERY beneficial practice in terms of gaining flexibility from stretching and releasing tension in fascia rather than building strength and releasing muscular tension.  Paul Grilley certainly knows his stuff - the only complaint that I would have mentioned was his constant dialogue throughout the poses, which can get a bit taxing at times - but I recently discovered that there is a menu option with which you may choose to edit out Mr. Grilley's dialogue.

2399851,5,B000B5871I,I already  have some favourite yoga DVDS but I bought this DVD because I had been working long hours and was quite fatigued at night . I wanted to do something that I could more or less flop through which released tension and wasn't strenuous. The first night I did the kidney sequence and enjoyed just melting into the long poses. Afterwards I was so relaxed and had a deep sleep. This state of deep relaxation lasted for 24 hours ! I love this DVD . I especially love the way Paul Grilley promotes the idea that a good pose is not one that should match exactly some yogic template  but is one where you go inside yourself to make those micro adjustments you sense your body needs. A couple of poses I can not do to anywhere near the level of his class. I just do what I can do and still benefit. I have used acupuncture successfully to treat some ailments and love the idea that this workout benefits my Chi levels. I then bought Sarah Powers DVD and her book. It's all excellent. The set is quite plain but I've made my experience more atmospheric by simply lighting a couple of candles and putting essential oil into a burner.,1271203200,13,1130,4.3254716981132075

I have always had issues with tight hips and a tilted pelvis.  This is the first work out that has made a significant difference in my practice and my ability to deepen into what were previously challenging poses (ex: baddha konasana, upavista konasana, bhujangasana).  I say this is for experienced students because it truly helps if you know your body and can read subtle differences in body sensation and know how to ALLOW rather than STRIVE (which in my experience Beginners cannot fully understand how to do).  By holding positons for extended time periods one is able to explore new sensations and create openings like never before.  But the body must be honored, one cannot force these openings.  Paul Grilley is extremely knowledgeable and acknowledges all levels of ability.  I truly love his teaching style.  I have yet to try his yang flow practice which requires a serious degree of flexibility.  This should be called tai chi yoga because his names for postures and other terminology come from a tai chi background.",1268265600,5,1159,4.86734693877551
2399855,5,B000B5871I,"I am SO happy that a friend of mine (& fellow yoga instructor) turned me on to Paul Grilley's work.  I LOVE this DVD & I LOVE Yin Yoga.  His lecture on here is just as fantastic as that on his other two DVDs (anatomy + chakras).  He explains things in a very organized and succinct fashion, making it easy to get what he means.  His sequences on the second DVD are fantastic-- my favorite of which is the Hip Series, since it helps you to really dig in there and release all kinds of tension.

Since adding Yin sessions to my home practice a month ago, I have noticed a serious increase in my range of motion, which allows me to move further into asanas in my ""Yang"" practice too.  But really more than anything, I feel things opening up, energy moving-- I'm feeling unstuck & it's the dead of winter, which is usually a time that I'm prone to collapsing in on myself.

I've added some Yin-ness to the classes I teach, most especially in a meditation class.  Square Pose before sitting for 30+ minutes is just what the doctor ordered.  :)

I can't recommend Paul's DVDs enough & I am definitely looking forward to whatever else he produces, as the odds of me being able to get to one of his workshops are pretty slim.",1263168000,7,1217,4.298245614035087

In just a few sessions of the spine sequence my flexibility has noticably improved, especially in backward bends.  Even something as simple as the cobra was difficult for me, and now I just hang in the snail, reveling in the front of my torso getting such a great stretch.  Grilley is an excellent speaker and teacher.  I particularly like the way he addresses the mind body connection, as far as fear, and how we can approach it. Anxiety is soothed away, as he assures us that slight discomfort can be a good thing.  I am slowly getting the confidence to release myself into the stretches more and more.  A great feeling!  Grilley does seem to assume that the viewer has substantial experience with yoga. I know there are plenty of ""regular"" yoga dvds out there, but I wish Grilley would add one more.",1262131200,4,944,4.485380116959064

The DVD is good value as it has several routines with different focus. The explanation provided are good. Be forewarned though that yin yoga could very well be unlike most other yoga you may have done so far: this is not a bad thing, but this is an important thing to know. I now intertwine traditional ""yang"" practices with ying practices from this DVD, the yin yoga kit and the book from Sarah Power and I enjoy it very much.",1259020800,2,542,4.43

Using different people and body types, both male and female, he demonstrates ways to adjust the poses to achieve the desired results without injury or excessive discomfort. One holds yin poses for 2-4 minutes--much longer than more familiar yoga poses--so some of them can inherently be a tad uncomfortable at first, but the results are fantastic and pretty immediate.

2399869,5,B000B5871I,"I'm still a beginner but my wife has been practicing Hatha Yoga at home for more than 20 years mostly using videos.  For the past year we both attended a yoga studio for more detailed instruction where we were introduced to Yin Yoga.  Yin Yoga focuses on the connective tissues rather than the muscular tissue in the body and is a very good complement to Hatha and other forms of Yang Yoga.  The positions are held for 3-5 minutes and use gravity instead of your muscles to put the targeted connective tissue into extention.  What we liked most about the yoga studio was the detailed instruction on how to safely put yourself into a correct yoga position to maximize the benefit and how to adjust the position to your body type and conditioning, including the proper use of props.  When the yoga studio went out of business, we decided to continue our practice at home and purchased the subject Yin Yoga DVD by Paul Grilley.  After a month of practice, we can wholeheartedly endorse this DVD and recommend it to others.  The expertise of the instructor is evident and the quality of instruction is as good as the personalized attention we received at the studio.  Disc 1 of the two disk set contains a two hour detailed lecture on the theory of Yin Yoga and is a must before continuing on to the guided practices on disc 2.  I generally can't sit still for a two hour movie but had no problem paying attention to the lecture.  Disc 2 contains three guided practices of about one hour each that focus on hip opening, spinal bends and an ""infant series"" emulating the progressive movements of an infant.  My wife and I alternate the three sessions every other day.  In addition there are about two hours of material including Yang movements in the Chinese tradition and bonus Yin practices.  The set is a little pricey for an exercise DVD but considering the quantity and quality of the material presented, is well worth the price.  Bottom line:  If you would like to learn Yin Yoga without signing up for a studio class, this is the DVD to get.",1256515200,15,2043,4.558904109589041

From the theory on disc 1 to the practical application on disc 2, this set is a complete health restoration kit.  If I go a few days without doing my yin yoga DVD, I physically CRAVE getting back to it.

One of the best features of the DVD is the alternate audio.  You can do the sets without the instructor's voice and just listen to some nice, calming, ambient music.  Now that I've heard his commentary a dozen times it's nice to be able to not hear it anymore and just get some music instead.

It's pretty amazing how a simple sequence of poses can rejuvenate your spine and add length to your form.  I need this practice like air or water.

This is simply one of the healthiest things I've come across in a very long time.  It's so basic: decompress your spine for more vitality, good health and well being.  We should all be doing this several times a week.  It should be taught in public schools.

I'm glad this teaching is available on DVD and I don't have to pay $60 to YogaWorks for a fancy/expensive seminar.  This is the best health investment you'll make and it'll last for years.",1243555200,8,1181,4.3090909090909095

2399875,2,B000B5871I,"I saw all the great reviews on this and decided to buy it.  I thought I was going to get a yoga DVD that was soft and peaceful.  Wow, was I wrong.  First of all the instructor does not stop talking through every pose.  He doesn't even allow you to experience the moves for yourself.  He keeps on giving his ""wisdom"" throughout each pose.  His voice is neither soothing nor relaxing, its simply irriating.  I will say I am not an expert on Yinyoga, but I don't think this was it, unless Paul Grilley is the one who invented it.  I could be wrong here.  The poses were difficult which is not a problem, but there was no real attention to proper body alignment.  The instructor simple told the participants to move in a way that was ideal for their body.  Well many inexperienced participants will simply do this and end up in the wrong position, and possibly hurt themselves.

I am so tired of self expressed ""experts"" on yoga who simply make up a style of yoga, give it a name and sell it to us.  While this style of yoga included some of the ancient asanas, they were not qued properly and therefore their true benefits could not shine through.

The application DVD does a very good job of providing examples  for differing physical abilities, while continuing to stress that the ultimate goal of the postures is to achieve positive results from stretching connective tissue, not mimic the people on screen.  Having only 15 minutesavailable for the first session I attempted (the spine workout) gave me unexpected relief from pain in one of my knees.

I play the drums also, and experience a considerable amount of pain in my lower back and tightness in my right hip.  The postures have loosened up and provided relief in both of those areas.  Being a person who has a tendency to jump into new routines full speed ahead (sometimes with bad results), I appreciate that Mr. Grilley is continuously stressing patience, consistency and focusing on long-term gains.

2399891,5,B000B5871I,"I am a certified yoga teacher, have taught yin yoga for two years, and been familiar with Paul Grilley's work for quite some time.  Allow me to let you in a secret - yin yoga is simply holding standard yoga postures longer (2-5 minutes) and trying to relax the muscles during the poses.  There is nothing complicated about a yin practice, and it is particularly useful for beginners, the chronically ill, seniors, and anyone wanting or needing to have the time during a yoga practice to go deeply inward.  Grilley has renamed traditional hatha yoga postures (for example he calls pigeon ""swan pose"") so there aren't any new postures to learn.  It is the way of practicing these postures that is unique.

I tend to dislike the packaging and branding of yoga ""styles"" as a commercial endeavor, however Yin Yoga: The Foundations of a Quiet Practice is extremely well done and worth owning.  One strength of the DVD is Grilley's detailed explanation of anatomy and theory.  He explains how yin yoga affects fascia and connective tissue and why practicing yoga this way can be so transformative to the body and mind.  The DVD serves not only as a practice tool, but as a source of education about the role of connective tissue and fascia in the body.  Grilley has brought the philosophy behind cranial sacral massage to yoga.  The results are transformative.

The second strength of the DVD is the well thought out organizational format.  The DVD contains a stand alone lecture for background information.  The individual yin practices are broken into categories, such as hip openers, and there are also three yang sequences.  What is particularly ingenious is that the viewer has two narration choices for the sequences.  You can choose detailed narration with explanations and anatomical cues, or you can choose to have a more quiet practice with minimal narration.  Grilley is very skilled at narrating, and his cues and explanations are informative without being distracting.  I appreciate his emphasis on the individuality of a person's practice and that yoga is about making a pose your own.  Viewers learn that yoga is not about exactly imitating the teacher or following some preconceived notion of what a posture should look like.  With that approach towards yoga, he uses the models in the DVD to show how people experience poses differently.  For example he compares a very flexible model to a stiffer one, showing how in pigeon the very limber person achieves a spine stretch, while the stiffer person experiences primarily a hip stretch.  Do not heed other reviewers' criticism of this DVD as being inappropriate for beginners or seniors.  Grilley uses models with a range of flexibility, however the DVD could have been stronger if he used one model that needed the aid of props for certain poses.  His overall message of making a yoga pose work for your individual body will make even a stiff beginner feel comfortable trying a yin yoga practice.  Lastly, there are several bonus routines that feature only a still picture of the pose, and timed prompts to move onto the next posture.  This section is great for someone who knows the postures already, and is seeking minimal guidance through a routine.  This section really allows you to go deeply inward in silence.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with this DVD.  Grilley's lecture is similar to the $150-200 he charges for a workshop, and the multitude of practice choices on the DVD will keep you challenged for a long time.",1181520000,87,3492,4.872881355932203
2399892,5,B000B5871I,"I have studied many styles of yoga, and Yin is one of my favorites, but you need to have this master DVD to really understand the full implications of the practice and how to do it. Yin gets to the core of connective tissue and holds each stretch for several minutes, allowing full stretching and relaxation of the muscles and tissue. It works along various meridians, and I could not live without doing this at least twice a week.  This DVD is great because one disk is a full explanation of the practice and the other is a series of one hour, 30 minute, and even shorter practices, with and without verbal instruction and music, so you can choose what you want to do, and it provides options for stretches that are too challenging or too simple.

2399893,3,B000B5871I,"He gives thourough explanations of what his message is.  I was disappointed that he used only young, very flexible models in wonderful athletic shape.  There was no consideration that we are an aging nation, and a nation that is not (overall) in great athletic condition.  The poses are held for a long time, but for much of that time the camera is on the narrator and when we are doing the workout if we look up to see an example of what he is talking about, we only see a man talking, not a person doing the pose.

2399895,5,B000B5871I,"I wrote a review of this DVD about a month ago and now am revising it because:

I cannot say enough good things about it!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.

What's so great?

1. There are hundreds of yoga dvds out there and almost all of them teach a variation of the sun salutation.  Thank you, Pranamaya and Paul Grilley, for breaking that mold!  Just for the refreshing change, I rate the DVD highly.

2. There is a lot of information on these DVDs.  The first in the set has ""Theory"" (which I haven't even viewed yet, because I have his book) and the other has three hour hour long Yin practices and 3 Yang (flow) looping sequences.  You can also create your own series and have the choice of doing the full hours with either instruction and talking or cues and music.

One reviewer said that this DVD is not for beginners.  I disagree.  As an intermediate yoga student, I've inadvertantly hurt myself doing so-called beginner practices from other DVDs that were for beginners on account of how fast they were moving; my brain and body did not hve time to adjust to the new posture, let alone breath into it.

Yes, the holds are somewhat long (4-5 minutes) but these are not difficult poses.  Anyway, the point is not to force your body into doing anything it absoutely cannot do.  Grilley offers suggestions for alternative poses and explains how and why one would hold their body a certain way based on both your flexibility and your bone structure.

I wrote this a month ago:

I find the Yin practice to be wonderful.  I can feel my body fighting it's ""need"" to hold onto tension.  Most days, it melts away and I end this practice feeling like I've done a long meditation and had an invigorating massage at the same time.  What could be better?

Now: after only one month, I am feeling and seeing the results of this practice.  It enables me to work harder in my other, more strenuous practices, and I'm having almost no chronic back pain after a day of work.

This is the best Yoga DVD I have, hands down.",1168905600,179,2027,4.389784946236559

You may only watch the educational DVD once, but the actual practice DVD you will probably use hundreds of times. That assumes you like yin yoga.

In addition to this DVD, I use the Sarah Powers Yin Practice, I think its title is Insight Yoga, and Erin Flemming's CD.

All are wonderful in their own ways.

Paul's is a great place to start as he gives excellent instruction in the actual poses.  He also shows people with different types of flexibility,

and ways to adapt the practice to your own unique body.  He offers a variety of yin practices as well as some very creative and fluid yang options.

Sarah's has a Buddhist slant that appeals to me.  She has two yin practices: one for the kidneys and one for the liver.  She also includes hatha vinyasa, savasana, and meditation.

As both a yoga practitioner and a teacher, Yin yoga is one of my favorite styles, and I thought that I could learn from this DVD. It has A LOT of content, and I still need to spend time watching the lectures in greater depth, as I've mostly just skimmed so far.

The first DVD is Grilley's lectures, all 108 minutes of them. I will have to come back to list the chapter breakdowns. Basically, Grilley covers anatomical differences and how this impacts individual practice. He discusses what makes yin yoga unique and how it complements more yang yoga practices.

The second DVD contains the yoga practices themselves. These focus on yin yoga, naturally, although a few yang routines are offered as well. I'll provide the menu listing and then describe details.

Yin Practices
*Hip Series, 70
*Spine Series, 62
*Infant Series, 63
Yang Practices
*Warrior 1:35 Play Lop
*Flying Dragon 2:38 Play Loop
*Golden Seed 1:22 Play Loop
*Custom Yang Sequences
Special Features
*Bonus Yin Practices

The heart of this DVD is the yin practices. For each, Grilley instructs a class of four students (including his wife), each of whom displays the poses showing different modifications and levels. Grilley states that the Hip Series focuses on the area above the knees to the lower spine, and it is designed to increase the range of motion in the lower pelvis and hips. The Spine Series places emphasis on the pelvis, sacrum, and spine; it includes several twists. Finally, Grilley describes the Infant Series as the ""least yin"" of the three. There is more work for the spine in a horizontal position, including a standing warm-up.

The yang practices aren't really follow-along routines, as they feature Grilley and his wife Suzy moving through flowing postures, often facing away from the camera. The Customized Yang option does provide a bit more in the way of actual practice choices, as here the viewer can mix and match practices to create short yang flows.

Finally, the Bonus Yin Practices opens a separate submenu. The routines themselves are in slideshow format, with a still photo to display the pose combined with Grilley's very brief voiceover cues naming when to come in and out of the pose. This menu is as follows:
*How to Use the Bonus Practices
Opening Practices
*Butterfly Opening Sequence - 28:40
*Dragonfly Opening Sequence - 28:25
Closing Practices
*Snail and Roots Sequence - 28:35
*Shoelace Sequence - 22:00
*Saddle Sequence - 25:02

8081393,5,B000B5871I,"I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Paul Grilley!  This dvd is truly amazing.  I knew nothing about yin yoga until a new massage therapist told me it might help me.  I decided I had nothing to lose.  I had major surgery two and a half years ago and have been in pain ever since, my whole body ached from top to bottom.  I would try to work out and that would make things worse.  My feet hurt if I walked too much, my back ached if I sat too much, just never comfortable.  Massages and chiro treatments helped temporarily.

When I looked on Amazon for yin yoga and found this dvd, I thought I would give it a shot.  It has done wonders for me.  I bought it in October '16 and I can now work out almost entirely without pain.  At first I was doing the DVD at least three times a week.  Now I strive to do the hip and spine sequences once a week the full way through.  I always feel so much better when I am done.  I also am now keenly aware when I am starting to get tight again.

This should be a requirement for everyone, but especially people who have gone through any type of major trauma and need recovery.",1490400000,5,1107,3.990867579908676

8081395,1,B000B5871I,"I was kooking forward to trying this dvd. Since I've done yin yoga, I went to the practices.  I didn't get far.  I have no desire to listen to someone lecturing for 5 minutes before he even starts the exercises.  Changing to the alternate audio without him talking is no better. Then, you're waiting for 5 minutes while he lectures before anything is started.  The exercises are shown with the instructor mouthing, but no words coming out.  Not better.  I totally dislike this.  Do your lectures in one series and do the yoga in another, not combined.  If you're doing the practice, tell us the pose, tell us what we're emphasizing, tell us modifications, if you want, but don't use this messed up lecture mode with ""alternate"" audio.  Total waste of money in my opinion. If I ever decide to try it again, I'll update, if appropriate.",1480809600,3,834,4.619047619047619
