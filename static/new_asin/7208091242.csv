7899776,3,7208091242,"Jean Renoir's first film in France since La Regle du Jeu had been met with almost unanimous hostility by critics and public alike 16 years earlier, French Cancan was a very deliberate attempt to reconnect with a French audience with a populist subject matter. As added security he cast Jean Gabin in the lead, though the results fall a long way short of their previous pre-war collaborations. Based loosely on the creation of the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris, offering `the illusion of the high life for modest purses,' and the romantic entanglements of financially insecure and terminally unfaithful impresario Jean Gabin and his latest discovery Francois Arnaul, who is pursued by a prince and a baker's boy but really wants Gabin, it's the sort of souffl&eacute; that should be a lot of fun. That it never really fulfils that promise isn't for want of trying: Renoir recreates la Belle Epoque with the kind of colours his father would have used and fills the supporting cast with colourful characters from all stratas of French society (a very young Michel Piccoli among them), and even casts veteran performers who graced the real Moulin Rouge like Edith Piaf, Patachou, Andre Claveau and Jean Raymond in cameos, but the script doesn't really do much with the material or the characters.

At times it's hard to escape the feeling that Renoir wasn't really the right director for the film - while not exactly heavy-handed, doesn't seem to have the lightness of touch this sort of thing needs. More surprisingly his use of the camera is surprisingly unadventurous and distinctly lacking in joie de vivre in the climactic musical number, much of which looks like it was shot from the cheap seats to make sure he gets everyone in the frame, proscenium arch style - not entirely out of place for a backstage story, but a rather disinterested approach you doubt the pre-war Renoir would have made.

There are hints of the old Renoir in its acceptance of the various characters faults - ""No better, no worse, just different,"" as Giani Esposito's suicidal Prince admits - and in the casual merry-go-round of relationships and alliances and the importance of appearances (because ""Appearances are all that can save us""), but this is neither deep enough nor superficially enjoyable enough to offer more than the odd passing pleasure as it inoffensively puts its characters through their paces in a somewhat workmanlike fashion. Not bad, just not nearly as good as its pedigree almost seems to demand it should be.

The BFI's Region B-locked UK Blu-ray/DVD combo benefits greatly from the recent restoration of the film, and is a noticeable improvement on the Criterion DVD. None of the extras from that earlier release - TV interview with Renoir, introduction by Peter Bogdanovich, new interview with production designer Max Doury and stills gallery - have been carried over, though there's a good selection of new ones carried over from the French Blu-ray release, but given the English subtitles that version lacked: a 57-minute documentary on the making of the film, a featurette on he restoration and a booklet (but not the additional 51 minute documentary on Renoir's legacy or the original trailer from the French release). As with the Criterion release, this is the uncut French version of the film rather than the heavily censored US release.",1355097600,3,3347,4.994623655913978
7899777,4,7208091242,"Amazon in France selling this considerably cheaper, even with shipping charge to the U.S..  Also, somebody posted that the UK version has English subtitles for the extras, unlike the French version.  But the UK version is locked into region B.  I bought a gizmo that supposedly will let my Oppo play A-B-C blu-rays, but haven't had the nerve to install it yet.  This whole web of catches and traps is an insult to serious movie lovers who willingly pay for these discs.  They love to make us sit through that stupid statement in French and English on every DVD on how in Switzerland or some such place Interpol or some such group will have a case of the vapours if we so much as show the (purchased) DVD in a church basement to a group.  How about reciprocating by unlocking these items?  OK, I'm done -- for now.",1334275200,3,813,4.452702702702703
7899778,5,7208091242,"Jean Renoir (1894-1979), one of the old masters of the French cinema - he was film director, screenwriter, actor, producer and author in one - did French Cancan in 1955. It tells the story of a music hall entrepreneur, played by Jean Gabin, with Franoise Arnoul as the main female lead. Gabin, against many obstacles, gets money together for a new project - Le Moulin Rouge - where the main attraction is the Cancan, an earlier music hall dance now considered out of fashion. Not really, as the success of his new place shows. The whole style is light - the stage, the playing, the mood - and the production uses an interesting mix between real studio and dance hall. Renoir was active into old age - like his father, the famous painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Renoir, My Father (1962), remains the definitive biography.",1316217600,5,819,4.734265734265734
7899779,4,7208091242,"From the start, I blatantly refuse to compare this film to Huston's ""Moulin Rouge"" - these are two distinctly seperate works, and though their subject might be the same, it would be a disservice to the merits of both to place them on the same page.  That having been said...

From the great storyline to the rip-roaring dance finale, this is one heck of a movie-musical.  Far, far too obscure, at least in this country - I've told innumerable friends about it, always with the same result - they tell me they've never heard of it.  Well, now that you have, it's very well worth your time to check it out.

Firstly, the character development is fantastic.  Jean Gabin shines as the impresario Danglard, Francoise Arnould is wonderful as his ingenue/inspiration Nini, and Maria Felix is devastating as the diva, La Belle Abesse.  As well, look for the glittering talents that surround - the peripheral characters are a delight to behold.  And, of course, the great Edith Piaf makes a brief appearance, as well.

Another quality I love about this film is the relatively accurate depiction of 1890's Paris - the costumes, colors and attitudes are well captured.  The truth of the ""casting couch"" is openly mentioned, and relationships between performers and impresario are depicted with often saddening accuracy.  On a lighter note, the dances are captured beautifully, as well - throughout the film they shine, in rehearsal rooms, dingy bars, and, of course, in the aforementioned finale.

Overall, this is a most enjoyable film - and, unlike many ""golden age"" Hollywood musicals, it doesnt' shy away from the ugly truths of life in the theatre.  Well worth a viewing - and very well worth purchase.",1115337600,5,1696,4.888111888111888
7899780,5,7208091242,"FRENCH CANCAN is arguably Renoir's best film in the 1950s (rivalled only by THE GOLDEN COACH and THE RIVER). It may well be the best filmization of that oft-filmed musical hall story, Moulin Rouge. It surely beats the hell out of John Huston's colourful but basically vacuous 1952 MOULIN ROUGE or any other contender. FRENCH CANCAN is wonderful example of the kind of farcical frivolity that characterizes Renoir's work in the 50s. In a sense, the film struck me as a semi-sequel to the magical THE GOLDEN COACH, although FRENCH CANCAN is much more intricate and restrained work. But both films are uniquely similar in that they never venture outside the theatre. Some critics have rudely charged the film for being too stagy and theatrical, but what the critics fail to see is that Renoir celebrates the theatricality of movies: He finds energy and vigour in the theatre functioning as a profound metaphor for life.
But what's so special about FRENCH CANCAN, aside from the exquisite colour, music, and dance numbers, is the way it understands that the wonderful world of the theatre is a result of hard and painful work. As the film proceeds, it leaves behind some hurtful feelings. Some of them are not reconciled. And Jean Gabin, in one of his greatest performances, is very adept at conveying these sombre feelings. Nonetheless, such feelings become thing of a past when the film reaches its spectacular finale, with the gusto of swirling cancan dancers.
FRENCH CANCAN is the most passionate and invigorating work of Renoir's late period. It is also my second favourite Renoir after THE RULES OF THE GAME.",1000339200,10,1610,4.922794117647059
