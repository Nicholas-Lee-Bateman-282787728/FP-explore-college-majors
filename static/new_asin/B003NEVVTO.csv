8400989,3,B003NEVVTO,"Not a bad little adventure series. Definitely a family type DVD. Some of the mini plots were clever. The villain was overboard corny. Had originally expected a more in-depth, serious adventure story based on the reviews I read prior to my purchase. But it was a little disappointing. Some of plot worked hard at trying to be funny and often struggled to succeed in the process. Animation was above average. Was a chore watching it all the way through, but it did hold my interest enough to make it to the suspenseful happy ending. Basically would rate it only about of 6 of 10.",1473379200,,577,4.5576923076923075

8400991,4,B003NEVVTO,"The series is a classic and almost required anime viewing material.

That being said, the DVDs themselves are of horrible quality. There is noticeable degradation in the recording process.

The worst part about these discs is that there are moments where the disc freezes. The freeze moment on disc one stops entirely. The freeze moment on discs two and three play after a few minutes.

There are other annoyances, like moments where the original animation is shaking gentle back and forth as if it was recorded by a cam-corder.

That said, even with the terrible production quality, the series is still enjoyable.",1418169600,,614,4.990196078431373

8400993,5,B003NEVVTO,"I am not great at reviewing anime because I either like it or I dont. But this series is one of my favorites and I wanted to share with the world what I think about it. If you read the other review currently posted about this series, Mr. Marvin is 100% correct on his observations of the OVA version and the Wanderers version. Both versions are good in their own merit, but The Wanderers does so much more on character development and really gets you into the story. This is done better in the Wanderers mainly because it is longer then the OVA.

The product page lists 4 disks when there is actually 5. The quality is great, the last time I watched this series was on VHS, and it translated well. The only problem I have is that it is on the old 4:3 TV scale when everything I have been watching recently has been widescreen. Having a widescreen TV and Laptop, I will always have the black side bars. But audio is great, and even the english Dub in this series is great. I know I am a minority in wanting dubbed over subbed, but that is what I enjoy.

If you are looking for a comedy that is super crazy, has some drama and love story to it, then this is a perfect series for you. I highly recommend it, and have even gifted it to friends.",1367020800,4,1240,4.1625
8400994,5,B003NEVVTO,"I am comparing Wanderers with the 12 episode OVA which was too serious considering the plot.  Make believe worlds are best viewed with as much humor and craziness as possible.  Wanderers starts off with fast paced action and character development.  Then the quest of the Wanderers begins with many twists and humor.  The finish is of the save the world from total destruction variety, with just enough humor and stupidity. The creators of the OVA learned their lesson about character development.  Sometimes it is more important how you tell the story.",1343174400,7,552,5.021978021978022
