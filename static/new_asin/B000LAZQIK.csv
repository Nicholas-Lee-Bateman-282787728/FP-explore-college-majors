8160548,4,B000LAZQIK,"This is an excellent documentary with D-Day veterans discussing their experiences.  However, there is a serious error.  In discussing the fighting at Graignes, the narrator refers to this as a 101st Airborne Division action - NOT SO!!!  It was the 507th PIR of the 82nd Airborne Division who fought there.  I was quite shocked at such a glaring error in the otherwise excellent documentary.  I must wonder what other errors are in the documentary in areas I am not familiar with.",1192665600,4,479,4.864197530864198
8160549,5,B000LAZQIK,"I had this DVD bookmarked for along time and was unable to confirm that it is a show about the Normandy campaign.  As you can see from the description, there is no indication of what the show is actually about, and the DVD jacket is misleading because it shows modern combat soldiers.  Extensive searching on the internet came up empty.  The customer relations departments of both Amazon.com and The Discovery Channel could not confirm.

I ordered it hoping it would be the Normandy program I saw, got it today and confirmed it was in fact the excellent show I had previously seen.  When I came to confirm it to the masses, I saw B. Cooke's review - thanks B. Cooke, I'm glad you're out there !

It's an excellent show with plenty of footage that I had not seen before, and I've seen my fair share !",1181001600,3,799,4.401360544217687
8160550,5,B000LAZQIK,"Extremely well made program. Very thoughtful. A great story told by the veterans themselves. Great interviews, recreations and images of Normandy. Would recommend it to anyone. One of the best, if not the best I've seen about D-Day!",1180656000,2,232,5.131578947368421
