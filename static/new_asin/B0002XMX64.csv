8180487,4,B0002XMX64,"Though the episode aired two years prior to man's initial landing on the moon, ""Moonshot"" posed an interesting guestion: What if alien invaders did try to sabotage the lunar landing by having a double on board?  B-movie star John Ericson has the role of the ""doppelganger"" while a pre-""Mission Impossible"" Peter Graves plays the head of NASA security.  Joanne Linville is the astronaut's suspicious wife while character actor Strother Martin plays a beachcomber that witnesses a murderous assault by the aliens on fishing astronauts.

The episode also features other fixtures of 60's television: Ross Elliott, Richard X. Slattery, Anthony Eisley, and Kent Smith, the latter who would later join star Roy Thinnes in ""The Invaders"" second, and last, season.",1161907200,4,755,5.3277310924369745
