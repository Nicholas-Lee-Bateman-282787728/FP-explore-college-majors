7931640,3,B000056AY5,"Not a particularly original heist/noir combo from Great Britain but quite enjoyable if your expectations are modest. A down on his luck gambler (George Baker, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) decides to visit his timid accountant brother (Terence Morgan in a grating hysterical performance) who's gotten himself involved with a gold digging tart (Diana Dors). Dors eggs Morgan on to rob the safe at his place of business but when Baker attempts to stop him, everything goes wrong. None of the characters are likable so you can't really have anyone to side with which lessens the suspense. You actually want them to get caught! Still, that magnificent overinflated structure called Diana Dors is something to watch and she gives the best performance in the movie, too! Directed by Gordon Parry, cinematography by Douglas Slocombe (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK) which captures the grim and grimy working class factory town in evocative B&W. With a score by Tristam Cary that occasionally sounds like Bernard Herrmann.

The British import from Odeon Entertainment ""Best Of British"" collection is a decent full frame B&W transfer.",1294358400,2,1121,5.193370165745856
7931641,3,B000056AY5,"Two brothers, one a gambler and the other a steel factory accountant, are led by Miss Dors onto stealing the factory's money to cover up for a small amount of cash embezzled out so that one of them might take an expensive vacation with her. The irony is that a factory guard catches them and is killed. Guilt caused by the crime and an old man who  witnesses it drives the accountant mad with fear and a final confession, but the old man who saw it was really blind! Diana Dors could play her part blind and in her sleep by now, but better films have something more sympathetic for a character she portrays.",1226448000,,607,4.324561403508772
