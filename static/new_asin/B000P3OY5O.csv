8188768,2,B000P3OY5O,"I think that rating a DVD has to be a little different than rating a movie.  I mean to say, the purchase of a DVD implies one wishes to watch a movie more than once, so the question isn't simply ""is this a good or interesting movie"" but rather, ""would I want to watch this movie more than just one time?""

In the case of this movie ""Sadma,"" well, except for the slight perversity of the plot and the unhappy ending, it was indeed an interesting movie to watch - ONCE.  But it's not a ""song and dance"" bollywood movie that one might want to watch over and over.",1314576000,,560,4.1192660550458715
8188769,5,B000P3OY5O,"Well, especially for the western readers i must say that if u have not seen this movie yet(ofcourse u didnt...!) then its just like missing out ""One flew over the cuckoo`s"" nest of urs...yes it is one of the greatest work Indian cinema has ever produced. The Kamal hassan and Sridevi are at their best and so is director balu. The movie is all about a girl in her early twenties who after meeting an accident lost her memory as well as senses...well not exactly senseless but no better than a six year old. Kamal met her in a brothel and After meeting her, he just couldn't stop thinking about her and somehow managed to flee her from the hell..now its all about how he brought her at his home and how he treat her like a child, without getting diverted in terms of human instincts, cosidering the beauty she is.. and then the climax is superb and the most watchable part of the movie...Kamal`s performance of life...you just cant come out of the theater witout some drops...!then the music score by Illyaharaja is as touching as the movie itself...All the complexities of life with emotions flowing all over, movie is a great experience.",1306281600,,1138,4.583333333333333
