8726434,4,B012PN4NGG,"It's certainly not on the same level of excellence as other Argentinean hits like ""Wild Tales"" or ""The Secret in Their Eyes"", but it's also not trying to be. A very simple, light-hearted comedy. There's not too much to see here, but I found this film to be more or less enjoyable. Not too much happens, it's basically just a film about 6 friends and their weekend hanging out in a cabin, but their was enough funny moments and decent acting to keep me more or less entertained. It won't change your life, but it's a decent way to spend an hour and 40 minutes.",1447718400,,559,4.333333333333333
8726435,3,B012PN4NGG,"This 96-minute 2015 film from Argentina is the latest release from Strand Releasing  a company the has released a variety of quirky small films I probably would not find elsewhere. I couldn't find any other reviews on the Internet (except the trailer and so I watched it with an open mind when I received an advance screener for an objective review.

The plot is simple. six 20-somethings (2 men and 4 women) head off to a summer house to celebrate New Years Eve (remember this is South America where is it warm then). One comes as a pair  boyfriend/girlfriend  while the other male (whose grandmother owns the summer house) is attracted to a sexy friend of one of the other women. At first I thought it would be like The Big Chi;ll only with younger actors but its less about intelligent talk and more about having sex. Im not really spoiling things when I say that there is a lot of sex here. But no nudity. You will by the end of the first 20 minutes know how to curse (those F and S words) in Spanish. These use those a lot. There are also some fairly graphic bodily function moments.

Because the only thing the sextet does together (beside have sex  I won't call it making love and doing drugs) is play Volleyball, Im guessing the title refers to them changing partners.

I was hoping for a more concrete ending (I won't tell you how it ends) and did feel disappointed.
The film stars the director, who also write the script.

There are subtitles in English and  like most Strand releases, they are bold white and easy to read.

There are no bonus features except for the trailer and a few other Strand Trailers.

Maybe youll like this better than me. I liked the characters but (as in a few of the sex scenes) I just didn't feel fulfilled this time.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
