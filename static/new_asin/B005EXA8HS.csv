4669323,3,B005EXA8HS,"A nice assembled cast unfortunately does not make a great movie.  This is a family drama/comedy with a little social or civic responsibility moralizing in it.  The problem is mainly that the main attractions of a young Kathryn Grayson and stalwarts like Morgan and Byington don't really get to be very interesting.  By the end you are supposed to have some real affection for the family (Morgan in particular) but it is mostly a nice little nostalgia piece.  Wish it has a little stronger story but they tried to throw together too many plot lines without really anchoring on one here.  See it if you want to catch a young Grayson or you like Frank Morgan but don't go in expecting ""Life with Father"".",1389052800,,701,4.620967741935484
4669324,5,B005EXA8HS,"This movie is a piece of classic cinema and Virginian history. I enjoyed it as a child, and I bought this DVD to see it again. I am glad that I did. It is humorous, sad, happy, and heart-warming. Frank Morgan's performance is wonderful. It is a classic for the Lynchburg City area and the Forest, Virginia area in Bedford County. I would recommend this classic, showing Southern culture in the early twentieth century.",1339372800,6,418,4.662162162162162

8469156,5,B005EXA8HS,"Simply lovely story about a simpler, lovelier time in America. I disagree with people who feel is is slow going or dull. My family loved this movie. True it's not action packed or sensual, but the story is charming, the acting convincing and the clothing gorgeous! We loved how the family seemed like a FAMILY. Kathryn Grayson was beautiful as always but Frank Morgan stole the show giving the most convincing performance of the Vanishing Virginian. He generally drives me crazy as he nearly always plays the most annoying parts in movies, however this one he was given a role where he actually got to prove he possessed real talent.  Truly enjoyed this movie!",1469404800,2,660,4.7894736842105265

8469159,3,B005EXA8HS,Spring Byington and Frank Morgan are both TOO OLD for these parts. 52 and 54 would of been more appropriate as grandparents instead of parents  especially with the youngest child. Spring Byington at 54 the mother of a young child was ill casting. Otherwise run of the mill.,1421280000,,273,4.6875
