4395490,1,B004K67KQW,"Anybody who's been listening to the news lately will know what Jackass is all about.
And that is why I'm giving this film one star only.
People are fed up with actors playing the roles of individuals they're told are real and if they questioned it a few years ago they used to be punished.
I think it's over for Jackass.
Even if Jackass 4 does come out I'll boycott that too.
Let the boycotting of Jackass continue!
Screw Jackass to the smithereens!",1340755200,,449,4.421686746987952
4395491,5,B004K67KQW,"If you like the show, you'll love this collection.  Everything you'd expect and great DVD extras.  It includes Jackass One, Two, and 2.5.  I had to buy the third one separately to complete the collection.",1326240000,2,204,4.771428571428571
4395492,4,B004K67KQW,"My brother brought this over one Saturday and we watched it straight through. I give it credit for being original, if not tasteful. A few funny places, more brought a grin, some is boring, but in general it's so unusual it's not bad to see once.",1325635200,,245,4.3478260869565215
4395493,4,B004K67KQW,"As a whole, I like this 3 DVD collection.

The scenes therein that I find really disgusting and revolting are those pertaining to the defecation scenes. My opinion is, the latter should be a private ritual and not communal.",1300233600,2,223,4.717948717948718
4395494,5,B004K67KQW,"The Jackass 3 DVD box set is fantastic! SO funny, but DEFINITELY not for people who can't handle puke and nudity.",1296691200,6,113,4.428571428571429
4395495,5,B004K67KQW,"I can remember what fun it was to see all 3 movies in the theater.  It was such an event, and the only mistake the crew made is that the last one was part 3, and not part 9.  This crew does a lot of the same type of stuff that other comedians and stuntmen are doing, but they do it with such style that it cannot be truly duplicated.  The dudesons, dirty sanchez, and any other pretenders can't even come close.  I'd go so far as to call the Jackass crew the reigning champs of physical comedy, and I can't imagine that changing in my lifetime.  You can watch anything with the Jackass Logo and be entertained, and you can also go with Wildboyz, which is an extension of the same great stuff.  Unfortunatly not everything these guys do is great.  If you watch Viva La Bam, or Vito and Dunns world tour, you may be disappointed.  Just stick to the main guys, and you will be satisfied with your decision.",1294185600,7,903,4.209302325581396
4395496,5,B004K67KQW,"Three amazing Jackass flicks in one? How can you possibly go wrong? The price is good too.

I especially enjoyed Jackass 2.5. It may even be better than Jackass 2 with a lot of stuff that couldn't have been shown, were too long, or would've have been, surprisingly, too non-sequitur for a theatre release. All three movies are must-haves for ANYONE who likes to laugh and isn't uptight.

Don't listen to the idiot reviewers that give Jackass videos 1 star based solely on content, they obviously haven't matured enough to look past the initial shock and see the comedic value, ingenuity, art, and camaraderie between all of the lifelong-friends in the film.",1287273600,37,657,4.857142857142857
4395497,4,B004K67KQW,I love these naughty boys and their fun episodes. It's nice that they seem to know they have a large gay following and play to them unashamedly. The extras are lots of fun.,1470182400,,172,4.242424242424242
4395498,5,B004K67KQW,Husband loves it,1468800000,,16,4.666666666666667
4395499,5,B004K67KQW,"I go this pack a few Christmases ago. It includes jackass 1 , 2 and 2.5. Its nice to have some snacks and a drink and watch these for a few hours. I am going to get the rest too. I can't wait to get the other shoot off like viva la bam and wild boys. Its worth it to buy this!",1464566400,,276,3.467741935483871

4395512,4,B004K67KQW,"#3 in pack/box set I really did not care for. It was just a bit too gritty. (And that is really kinda saying something!) Other than that... No complaints!  Well actually... I did not like one of the so called skits in I believe it was the part #2 DVD,if I am not mistaken. It was were some rap group calling themselves I don't know, ""something, something Mafia"" where they got Mr. England to eat a cow patty for the chump change of $200. and while wearing just denim overalls. I would have told'em to eat it, &stick their 2c-notes up their black asses!!",1422748800,,553,4.3173076923076925
