I was a teacher for most of my career and do NOT encourage much TV/Video time for little ones - but used wisely - these are colorful, sweet, teaching basics of friendship, being kind to our friends, and are just busy enough and won't drive parents crazy, either.",1501891200,,385,4.5
8300143,5,B001F0K87O,"Pocoyo is a wonderful childrens show, very original and entertaining for adults too.

This DVD has 10 episodes:
* Colour My World
* Where's Pocoyo
* Hiccup
* Pato's Postal Service
* Puppy Love
* Elly Spots
* Up Up and Away
* Let's go Camping
* Fussy Duck
* Whale's Birthday

Just a note if you have a younger child - these set of episodes tend to have older themes than some of the episodes on other Pocoyo DVDs. (example: in Elly Spots Elly is sick and upset that Pocoyo and Pato are on a picnic without her, she so she acts pathetic and makes them run errands for her). So...the 18mo old did not quite get it. The 3 year old however *loved* it.

With that small reservation, this is a wonderful Pocoyo DVD",1259452800,,707,4.1838235294117645
