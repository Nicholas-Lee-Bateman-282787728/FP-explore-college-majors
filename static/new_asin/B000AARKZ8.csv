8077475,5,B000AARKZ8,"Kiddy Grade is a fun, sexy, adventurous tale. It sort of reminds me of . It would make a kick****ss live action film. But I have to tell you all something important. It's the fan service, or say the lack of. I read a lot of reviews about the shocking fan service, but to tell you the truth there is next to none, try battle vixens or blitzes tactics for over the top fan service, I do hope these reviewers are joking. I wished there was more jiggle.",1185062400,3,449,4.113636363636363
8077476,2,B000AARKZ8,"I bought this series to watch with my mom. The first three were good so we stretched it out and watched two every few days. Well lets just say after the third episode it was inappropriate! This blond girl sits up and is naked!! I was soo upset then Eclair the main star of the show, they show her bare behind! This show is for girls so why do the girls run around naked? IF you are a parent do not get this for your child. It be a good show if they keep it clean but that is not happening. I also will mention that there is blood in this show and it gets more bloody in the next set I saw the preview on this dvd. But I do have another suggestion try The Cat Returns movie from studio ghibli instead.  The cat retuns is clean adults and children will love that movie.",1160265600,2,767,3.9483870967741934
8077477,2,B000AARKZ8,"Don't waste your money on this series.  I found the plot very predictable and boring.  It follows a random storyline with nothing to really tie it together.  Series has very dry humor.  Provides the obligitory fan service, but with this series, that is not enough.",1142985600,,264,4.8
