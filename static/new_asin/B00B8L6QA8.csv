5563228,4,B00B8L6QA8,It's a great price for a ton of workouts but I wish there was a bit better variety- it's cardio heavy where it's harder to put together a balanced workout,1458518400,2,154,4.166666666666667
5563229,5,B00B8L6QA8,Love these programs.,1454544000,,20,6.0
5563230,4,B00B8L6QA8,"Perfect for adding a workout on in-between days on my 3 days a week workout schedule. Some are easier to do than others. Some of the dance/aerobic/kickboxing sets are hard to keep up with since they go so quickly. But I figure as long as I'm moving and doing something I'm at least getting a good enough workout...better than just sitting on the couch or staying in bed an extra 10 minutes. If this was your only workout routine, you probably would have to do at least 3 a day to see any real results. But I like that these are only 10 minutes and I can throw one in without spending too much time on a workout.",1452988800,12,611,4.186440677966102
5563231,5,B00B8L6QA8,Great mix of fun workouts. Love it!,1441584000,,35,4.142857142857143
5563232,5,B00B8L6QA8,I love the 10 minute solutions. Really good for at home working out.,1436745600,,68,4.3076923076923075
5563233,3,B00B8L6QA8,they are ok. Not motivating for me .,1478044800,,36,3.625
5563234,4,B00B8L6QA8,"These are fun little workouts if you like a lot of variety. I don't follow the calendar it came with, but I do string together several workouts to get in at least 20-30 minutes of exercise. The moves in most of them are pretty basic and easy to learn. You definitely can't get a great workout in 10 minutes, but strung together or as an add-on to other workouts they provide fun workouts with a lot of variety. It's definitely worth the low price for so many workouts.",1477958400,7,468,4.329545454545454
5563235,5,B00B8L6QA8,Great value. Perfect for squeezing in workouts on busy days.,1477267200,,60,5.1
5563236,5,B00B8L6QA8,"Great way to get fit, BUT I think they should make the work out a true 10 min and add the extra time to that for warm ups and cool downs.",1476230400,5,137,3.4516129032258065
5563237,5,B00B8L6QA8,Great variety of good workouts to help you get in top shape!,1472342400,3,60,4.083333333333333
5563238,4,B00B8L6QA8,I have not tried all the dvds yet. But for the price it is a nice set considering the dvds alone usually cost between 7-12 a piece. I love my other 10 minute solutions dvds. So once I have tried all the dvds I will update. But you can not go wrong for the price.,1472083200,,262,3.7818181818181817
5563239,3,B00B8L6QA8,"A few of these are great, at least one is mediocre and I was disappointed with at least 2 of them.  It's a good bargain for a wide variety of workouts, which is why I bought them.  I like the 10 minute solutions overall and the flexibility they offer.  But the variety is only good if you use them.  Some are too easy (not enough physical challenge) and a few are too complex (I don't want complicated moves, I just want a good workout!).",1467676800,10,438,4.178571428571429
5563240,5,B00B8L6QA8,Got these for my wife.  She loves the 10 minute solution workouts.  This was a really good deal buying them in a pack.  We have about 10 of these DVDs in total.  The workouts are challenging but not too difficult as I would say she's at the beginner to intermediate level.  Anyone considering these will be pleased.,1464480000,2,315,4.456140350877193
5563241,5,B00B8L6QA8,Good workout these are hard but it gets easier as you build up your endurance and stamina.,1463443200,,90,4.352941176470588
5563242,5,B00B8L6QA8,I love the variety of workouts. Definitely a better value than ordering the dvd's individually. Great results!,1460592000,,110,5.529411764705882
8564147,4,B00B8L6QA8,"Great workouts, but there were a few I felt weren't enough for me. For this price though its a deal. I don't recommend these for someone that cant do multiple things at once. For me though, I love that your mind has to be engaged to get the moves correctly, otherwise I get bored.",1517702400,,280,4.203703703703703
8564148,4,B00B8L6QA8,"I bought this pack since it had a big variety and included a workout schedule. Not having a set schedule or variety has been a big deterrent for me sticking with exercise in the past. The schedule didn't work out for me--the 3 day/week was too easy and got repetitive if used at ""double"" rate (6 days/week). And I hated the combinations on the 6 day/week plan--the workout lengths were not consistent (ranging from 30-50 minutes) and often involved using multiple disks, which lessened my motivation. Ultimately, because I liked the workouts in general, I bought two additional disks and just decided to scrap the included plan and pick 3 workouts from 1 DVD to do each day of the week. Most have a stretching (or less intense) segment included, so I combine 2 workouts plus the stretch for each day, and then the next week, I use the other two plus the stretch. It gives me a lot of variety that helps motivate me to do the ones I don't like as much when I know that once I get through it, I get a two-week break. And it is really easy to mix or match according to your needs. I also liked that each DVD had a different focus, which makes it easier to see what types of exercise I enjoy.",1509408000,,1188,4.331838565022421
8564149,5,B00B8L6QA8,Awesome mix of workouts! love this set!,1506211200,,39,4.714285714285714
8564150,5,B00B8L6QA8,"Great ten minute workouts !  There are many choices regarding which combinations of workouts to do. The workouts are difficult, but all are only ten minutes.",1495929600,2,157,5.038461538461538
8564151,5,B00B8L6QA8,Great variety of work outs and the calendar helped keep me accountable and excited to continue. Arrived in perfect condition,1493337600,,124,5.25
8564152,5,B00B8L6QA8,"It came as it is described with the five dvds and the exercise schedule. Some of the workouts are a little awkward in smaller spaces so I suggest you make sure there is plenty of room to move around in, especially when you try doing workouts with a buddy. I will admit that when I did a video with my sister the logistics were a little weird and she was so frustrated with the changes of direction that she cussed a few times and now refuses to that specific video with me.",1492041600,,473,4.1521739130434785
8564153,3,B00B8L6QA8,This is a 5  DVD  set. I did get 5 DVDs  but I ended up getting duplicates of one of them.,1490313600,,90,3.1904761904761907

8564156,2,B00B8L6QA8,"I've been doing Jillian Michaels workouts for a long time now, and was looking for a little more variety, and I happened across this box set. The price is excellent, $20 for 5 DVDs, meal plan and workout calendar. After trying out some of the DVDs I was very disappointed. I'm more of an intermediate exerciser, and I barely broke a swear doing this. The only disc that really challenged me was the Pilates. The rest of it, even the boot camp, was not that hard. I would recommend this for someone who is just getting into exercise, not for anyone that is looking for a challenge.",1481328000,6,580,4.429906542056075
