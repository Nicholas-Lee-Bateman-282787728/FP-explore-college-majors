Such fun to see the old spots. Like a time machine. Great for context, history wise. Sadly, the LOCAL commercial break intervals are not included, which would have been terrific because the band used to play during that time to keep the audience entertained and the network would put that music on the line along with a slide, so local stations would have something to go to in case they had a failure of their local commercials.  The Tonight Show Band was AWESOME and such a favorite of Johnny. It was a rare treat to attend a show in person, or even to watch a station that had trouble and therefore put the band back on during the local break interval. Perhaps the music was not included in this release due to issues with music rights, but it would have been so wonderful if it could have been. Perhaps they will someday do a release that features the music played during the local breaks! Wouldn't that be GREAT?!?!? Just like being in the audience!!!",1519603200,,1112,4.601010101010101

8685439,4,B00OYT32TO,"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson: The Vault Series contains 12 complete, unedited episodes of The Tonight Show spanning two decades  the 70s and 80s  and 4,000 shows. In this collection are Carsons 10th and 11th anniversary shows, and his birthday episodes with guests, including Dean Martin, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis, Don Rickles, Bob Hope, Dom De Luise, John Denver, Peter Fonda, Michael Caine, Charlton Heston, Michael Landon, Billy Crystal, Paul McCartney, Orson Welles, and Muhammed Ali.

There are additional appearances by Buddy Hackett, Lana Cantrell, Sean Connery, David Brenner, Charles Nelson Reilly, John Byner, Robert Blake, Bing Crosby, Desi Arnaz, Ray Bolger, Marvin Hamlisch, Karen Valentine, Joel Grey, Burt Reynolds, and Ken Norton.

For years, with Carson at the helm, The Tonight Show was a ratings champ and cash cow for NBC. Unfortunately tapes of his early shows were erased long ago and no longer exist.

Carson took over The Tonight Show from Jack Paar in 1962 and was its host for 30 years. Other hosts were Steve Allen, Jay Leno, and Conan OBrien. Jimmy Fallon has been the host since 2014. Carsons tenure as host was by far the longest to date.

Bonus materials on the 6-DVD set include an interview with Peaches Jones and stunt demonstration; interviews with David Letterman and Joe Piscopo; interview with Lucille Ball; show opening, monologue and desk chat with Johnny and Ed McMahon; a visit from Joan Embery and Rodney Dangerfield; and a sketch and James Brown performance and interview.",1506470400,,1526,5.133064516129032
