2736312,5,B000MKXESS,I have loved this movie since I first saw it on TV!  I am very happy to have my own copy now.  The child was still a little boy but also has a special knowing quality about him.  Its presented in a very believable way. Well worth watching.,1311465600,,239,3.9375
2736313,3,B000MKXESS,"I thought this would be good for children to view, but will not show it as I believe there are a number of inaccurate pieces of information included and do not wish to instill untruth to the children in our church!

2736314,5,B000MKXESS,Very well done movie about the childhood of Jesus.  We have been enjoying this movie for over 15 years.,1290816000,6,103,4.421052631578948
2736315,1,B000MKXESS,"We know very little about the childhood of Jesus; however, we do know somethings. This movie does not even follow the truths we do know about Jesus as a child. It actually is based on some heretical theories. I ended up throwing the movie out since it is so far from any truth. Susan",1272758400,4,283,4.2592592592592595
2736316,5,B000MKXESS,"This dvd of a ""Child Called Jesus"" arrived in a resonabile amount of time and in good condition.",1239926400,,96,4.388888888888889
2736317,5,B000MKXESS,I bought this movie for my mother-in-law after she told me she could not find it anywhere (she is not computer savvy).  She called me very shortly after she received it and was so surprised (as was I because it only took about 4 days for her to get it after I ordered it).  She told me she has watched it 4 times and loves it.  Thanks Amazon for the great service.,1229385600,3,364,4.027777777777778
2736318,5,B000MKXESS,La pelcula es excelente a pesar de estar basada en hecho no reales y apcrifos. Tanto la msica como la fotografa ayudan a recrear cmo hubiese sido la infancia de Jess. Lstima que no est disponible la tercera parte de la serie titulada La Misin.,1228176000,,243,4.4222222222222225
2736319,2,B000MKXESS,There was only one thing that I found to be wrong about  the film was the editting.  It should have been on 2 DVD's and not one.  3/4 thru the film they ran the Credits again ( Like the stars of the movie).  It was very well made and the Actors were great. A really nice story.  I am happy that I have it in my collection.,1190592000,2,322,3.746268656716418
2736320,5,B000MKXESS,The video was in great condition and arrived by time stated. Thank you much. The grandchildren loved it too.nana,1188259200,3,112,4.947368421052632
2736321,5,B000MKXESS,"This Italian production, first released in the U.S. in the late 80's is a great family film, first-off. Also, though it does not draw from biblical accounts so much as Gnostic Gospels, it still manages to show Jesus' humanity as well as give us glimpses of his destiny with visions the boy has at key moments. The movie is dubbed well and that does not detract from its beauty.",1178496000,11,377,4.478260869565218
2736322,5,B000MKXESS,One of the most beautiful. movies I have every seen. I don't know how accurate it is but it doesn't matter. They paint young Jesus in a very beautiful way.,1454630400,,155,4.2
2736323,5,B000MKXESS,"A Amazing and Awesome Movie about Jesus Christ.
5 Stars, inexpressible in words.",1453507200,,80,5.230769230769231
2736324,1,B000MKXESS,Very dark barely visible picture. Extremely poor reproduction. Wish I had my money back.,1451520000,,88,5.357142857142857
2736325,5,B000MKXESS,"I have been looking for this movie for years and I finally got it! Of course, you only had one, so when my mother found out that I had found it, well guess who got this beautiful movie.......",1440806400,,191,4.052631578947368
2736326,3,B000MKXESS,"I remember watching this two-part miniseries originally made for Italian TV on WPIX 11 back in the late 80s. It seemed then to be a fairly well-known and well-regarded movie but appears to have fallen into obscurity since it originally aired.  Be forewarned that although the movie is listed as being in English, it's actually dubbed; sometimes it's barely noticeable, but sometimes it seems like Godzilla is about to show up.  Due to the fact that the film was not originally in English, the dubbing occasionally loses something in the translation and lends itself to some bizarre turns-of-phrase.  The DVD contains no extras (I would have liked the original ads from WPIX to be included, for instance); both parts of the miniseries are included on the same side of the disc, so be forewarned that at one point, the movie will appear to be restarting about halfway through.  The picture quality is so-so; actually, it looks very much like it did on WPIX back in the 80s, which doesn't look good on a contemporary HD flatscreen. As for the story, it's an interesting take on the life of Jesus, portrayed here as a pretty typical 7-year old who is nevertheless aware that he is anything but.  The plot follows the Holy Family's travels through Egypt and Palestine, evading a mystic who is obsessed (for seemingly no reason) with finishing the job that Herod started and killing Jesus.  There are many interesting ideas scattered throughout the film (such as Jesus' visions of his future, bringing to mind Paul Atredies in the Dune novels) and the Holy Family is the heart of the story.  A religious audience may enjoy this film very much; a secular audience might find it merely interesting.  A Child Called Jesus is a cut above the usual low-rent production qualities of this sort of movie, but it's got nothing on Cecil B. DeMille.",1418774400,2,1832,4.7936507936507935
2736327,5,B000MKXESS,"This was so wonderful.  We had viewed this many years ago when my daughter was very young as a two-night TV special and now to have a copy is a special blessing.  I think it is worth having, you appreciate more what sacrifices were made for you especially during this Christmas season.",1417651200,,285,4.461538461538462
2736328,5,B000MKXESS,"This is such a wonderful view of what Jesus may have been like as a youngster!:). I may donate the movie to my church library.
I want everybody to see this....when you already love God and Jesus and you see this..,you will love them more!:)",1410480000,,240,4.355555555555555
2736329,5,B000MKXESS,"Just what we were looking for,  the product came in good time, and new and it was very well packaged.  This movie so great, the little boy is so cute, good little actor.",1400889600,2,169,4.090909090909091
2736330,5,B000MKXESS,for this to become public.  First saw it on PBS WGBH Boston in the late 80s.  It did not become public till now!  Beautiful and perfect Life of Christ up to the return of the Holy Family to Jerusalem.,1395705600,2,200,4.076923076923077
2736331,5,B000MKXESS,"kind of old filming and voice dubbing ...wish an american film company would re do it with better music score.i loved it , made Jesus seem more real.",1395705600,,149,4.357142857142857
2736332,4,B000MKXESS,This was an excellent DVD.  I know that the story line was speculative but was well written.  The young actor portraying Jesus was heart warming. The best movie of the possible events of the early years of Jesus.,1393459200,2,212,4.552631578947368
2736333,5,B000MKXESS,This movie is about Jesus when he was a child but I believe people of all ages would enjoy it. It's quite entertaining and I recommend it.,1390435200,,138,4.148148148148148
2736334,4,B000MKXESS,"I am guessing that this is the only movie which shows what Jesus probably be doing growing up.  Although purely fiction, it is entertaining.",1388275200,,140,4.833333333333333
2736335,5,B000MKXESS,I can Highly recommend this delightful film but unfortunately the tone was poor & may need to replace this DVD,1380326400,,110,4.55
2736336,5,B000MKXESS,"I saw this movie  on TV 15-20 years ago (or longer) and fell in love with it.  I waited for it to come on again, but when it did I missed the showing. To my knowledge it never was shown again.  I am not computer savy so never thought on looking on line until about 4 months ago when talking with someone who uses Amazon all the time and suggested I try Amazon.  It met all my expectations and will watch it  especially during the Xmas and Easter holiday seasons.",1378339200,2,462,4.088888888888889
2736337,5,B000MKXESS,"When my son was small, I stumbled upon this movie on tv.  I didn't remember the name, and found it recently through a chance search on Amazon.  I was thrilled to come across it again.  The story brilliantly and imaginatively fills in the blanks missing from the bible about what Jesus's childhood might have been like, how he was divinely different from every other child, and how his mother Mary dealt with having such a special child.  Wonderful movie for the whole family.",1378252800,,475,4.686746987951807
2736338,5,B000MKXESS,Great movie of Jesus! The quality of the DVD is super duper clear! I think more people should watch these type of movies!,1370563200,,121,4.304347826086956
2736339,4,B000MKXESS,"I wish I had the original soundtrack, the English over dubbing was terrible. Otherwise it was a beautiful movie visually",1368230400,,120,5.05
2736340,5,B000MKXESS,I will watch it over and over and over and I bought one for each of my 4 children for Christmas.  It is a MUST SEE AND OWN:),1366588800,,124,3.4285714285714284
2736341,5,B000MKXESS,"The characters were non-American/familiar and seemed more realistic.  I loved the character child Jesus played by Matteo Bellina which gave a glimpse into what Christ's childhood may have been like, and the movie also showed another side of what his parents went through while raising Jesus.  I saw it years ago on TV and have always wanted it; I believe it is one of the most powerful biblical movies ever to help raise the consciousness and the soul; now that the internet is available basically any movie you want can now be purchased.",1357430400,3,538,4.774193548387097
8169531,5,B000MKXESS,"This is a great story. It tries to capture what Jesus' family would have been like in at that time in his life. Likewise, it was nice to see the father/son dynamic between Joseph and Jesus. I would recommend to anyone looking for a family friendly movie.

P.S.
It runs a little on the long side (3 hours give or take an hour) so it may not be suitable for families with young or rambunctious children.",1517616000,,401,4.276315789473684

8169535,5,B000MKXESS,I ordered it because I saw it on cable a while back. It is good but the sound was too low on my television. It is not the sellers fault.,1469664000,,136,3.566666666666667
8169536,5,B000MKXESS,This is a wonderful film that I will watch again.,1464220800,,49,4.0
8169537,5,B000MKXESS,"This is the most delightful movie. Some of it is loosely based on the Gospel of Thomas, and a little from the others not included in the Bible. Some is taken from the small amount of historical evidence that has emerged about Jesus after the Holy Family left Bethlehem. So it is fiction, not intended to be anything more. But it is fun to try to imagine the childhood of Jesus, and what his relationships with his parents might have been like. Very well acted, beautiful cinematography, great scenery, costumes, excellent make up. I have watched it several times, and always see something new. The child actor Matteo Bellina is just extraordinary. I did not even know that it was Italian, with English dubbed in until the middle of the movie, very good job there. Not intrusive at all. And of course the movie benefits from the Italian beauty always present in film making. A movie that adults and children will love.",1462492800,,917,4.666666666666667
