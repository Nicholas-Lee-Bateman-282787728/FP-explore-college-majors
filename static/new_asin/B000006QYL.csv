The main gods of Greece were explored, but it failed in the respect that many other documentrys have in that the many 'side' gods of Greece were all but ignored. Still, it was quite informative as the gods that were spoken of were covered to the point that you knew their power and influence over a people that worshiped, loved and feared them. I believe it is very interesting how a group of 'imaginary' gods had so much impact on the daily lives of a people that were very influential on modern thought. I highly recommend this video.",994982400,15,642,4.4491525423728815
