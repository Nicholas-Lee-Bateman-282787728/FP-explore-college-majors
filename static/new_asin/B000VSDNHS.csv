2949130,5,B000VSDNHS,"Engdgame is by far Alex Jones most powerful documentary. I am quite familiar with Alex Jones and much of the information divulged in the film. His last documentary, TerrorStorm, was an expose of government sponsored terrorism, including 9/11, 7/7, OKC and historical events used to instigate wars.

This film really delves much deeper into what the elite are trying to accomplish. If this is new to you, you will definitely want to check out his previous films, as well as Aaron Russo's America: Freedom to Fascism.

Though I enjoyed (I guess that is not really the right word; how could you enjoy hearing this stuff?) the entire film, I was especially blown away by the latter part of the documentary which covers the eugenics programs taking place in America and the connection of America to Nazi's. Again, for me, this is not new information. But I have never seen it presented so clearly with such substantial evidence.

This film is a must see for the section about eugenics alone. Did you know that tens of thousands of american girls have been sterilized against their will by the United States government? If not, see this film immediately!

It's time to wake up. Or soon we'll be out of time.",1194566400,5,1201,4.759615384615385
2949131,3,B000VSDNHS,"I won't waste your time, so I'll just get to why I gave this movie 3 stars and why I would suggest purchasing the must see ""Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition"" instead.

The first half of the movie is boring, too much activism/street action and not enough facts period. By facts I mean: information, documents, clips, sound bites, interviews, quotes, news clippings, etc. If this is your first time learning about the NWO or if you are showing this film to someone that is not awake, not only are they going to be bored - they are also going to be confused because they won't know why Alex is bull-horning cars, watching people, etc. To the people I showed this film too that weren't awake, the first half of the film was to them basically a fat guy (Alex) harassing people and doing stuff.

The other problems with the first half is that they will name people on screen that they spot at Bilderburg while doing surveillance, but won't tell you why these people are important. They'll just give a name and that's it. In some ways this made me feel as if Endgame was too rushed, a topic I'll get back to on later. And if Bilderburg is so powerful why not tell the viewers, especially the unawakened ones, about some of things they have discussed in past meetings that have come to pass? For example we could have mentioned how the Bilderburgers talked about the housing crisis that the US is having now, but instead we give no examples of how powerful this group is and how they shape the world. Finally the last problem with the first half of the film is that it's too much like an inside conversation. In other words, if you were in a conversation with 2 other people where person A and person B were talking about a topic they both knew well but you know nothing about, you'd feel quite lost and or bored. That's how the first section of Endgame feels to someone new to this NWO subject. Watching a bunch of guys congratulating each other on confronting Bilderburgers and bull-horning them and doing surveillance means nothing.

Now, if you can make it through the first half of the film the second, and superior half, of the movie will not disappoint. This is where the movie picks up speed and draws you into the world of the NWO, NAU(North American Union), and Eugenics. Whether your awake or not the second half will teach as well as entertain and shock you. If the second half was a movie by itself, it would easily get a 5/5. But due to the first half of the movie, it drops the score to its deserved 3/5 score.

Now I mentioned before that the movie seems a bit too rushed. I say this because of the first half of the movie, where they would name people and act as if they are important but won't tell you why or what they do, not giving examples of how powerful Bilderburg is,  as well as for the ending of the extra included on the DVD called ""The Battle For The Republic."" ""The Battle of The Republic"" ends too abruptly, as if there was more to say but it then got cut off. These problems also contributed to the 3/5 score I gave to this film.

In the end, Endgame is not a movie I would recommend to someone or show to someone that is unawake. If I were to show/recommend a movie to someone who is unawake it would be ""Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition"" because it is an excellent film period as well as the best film you can get on state sponsored terrorism, it is paced better, doesn't needlessly show activism like other Alex Jones films do, and just hits you with facts so that you know what is going on and not left outside of the loop if you are unawake, or bore you if you are awake. If you must show ""Endgame"" it should be shown to those that are awake, or to those that are unawake but have watched ""Terrorstorm: Special Edition.""",1194048000,59,3733,4.35632183908046
2949132,5,B000VSDNHS,"I would have to say that this is the best work that Alex Jones has done yet. You get the sense that he is maturing as a film maker, as he is able to stay focused and present the history on this subject in a calm direct way. In his older film's at times he would go off in many directions, even though his infomation was good, at times he would be very hard for me to follow, which would cause me lose interest. Not so with his last two film's.

With ""End Game"" and ""Terrorstorm"" before it Alex keeps the focus and presents calmly through is stern dictation the history of our global elete.

I hope that people who view this follow up and do their own research as I have, the in formation in the film is factual and can be verified. The United States citizens must face the fact that what has already happened elsewhere throughout history is going to happen here. We have no choice but to get people educated and to have them stand up for the rights that the foudning fathers gave their lives for!",1194048000,15,996,4.209424083769633
2949133,4,B000VSDNHS,"""End Game"" is an imperfect, yet important documentary which not only gives us the history of the Bilderberg Group, it takes us right up to the doorstep of one of their clandestine annual meetings letting us see the men behind the curtain, and outlines clearly their plans for global domination. If you don't believe in conspiracies and conspirators, you must watch this movie and see what the theorists have been talking about all along. A picture really is worth a thousand words.

While Alex Jones often gets in the way of his own message, the movie is still worth seeing and easier than reading the many books previously written about this topic.",1193443200,13,649,4.794642857142857

All fine and dandy if the highly uneducated masses didn't believe this tripe. The problem, however, is they do, and Jones plays them all like fiddles. As for the documentary itself, it's extremely disjointed and the assertions are poorly defended and ultimately irrelevant. Here is just one example: according to Jones, WWI was started in order to create the League of Nations with the expressed goal to create a single, global government. In reality, the League of Nations was proposed by Wilson only after the war started, and the US didn't even join it. Not only are facts incorrect, but the argument itself doesn't even support the argument.

I would suggest you watch ""invisible Empire: A new world order defined"", ""the world according to Monsanto"", ""State of mind: The Psychology of Control"", ""Poison on Tap"" and ""911: Road to Tyranny"" first though....Watching this one first may seem a little out of place to the uninitiated. I was a die hard fan of liberal views until I learned the terrible secret of the real world. We are all controlled, manipulated and used by private corporations that own most of the government. This documentary titled ""End game"" is truly an eye opening masterpiece that shows just how far the secret oligarchy controlling the world behind the scenes, is willing to go if we allow it to continue. I really am grateful to have been blessed by fate to have been fortunate enough to have seen this while freedom of speech is still allowed. Thanks to liberty revival masters like Alex Jones, I learned a great deal of information that only further backed up and confirmed what I already knew about shadow government was far worse than I thought and ahead of schedule. Thanks to the efforts of the film makers and my desire to disprove the conspiracy theorists, I found various historians, politicians, military, retired intelligence operatives, film makers, and patriots all dedicated to exposing a sinister conspiracy to control, manipulate and enslave all mankind gradually and covertly so we would not even know it was happening. Most of these Alex Jones produced documentaries I have watched tie in very well with testimony from former FBI director Ted Gunderson, the Kay Griggs interview with FBI,  William Copper, Jullian Assange and Edward Snowden's massive information leaks.. This Documentary exposes the Elites plans to manipulate us into a voluntary life of servitude in their new fascist police state they are slowly creating to enforce it..For those with religious beliefs not yet expressed in Alex Jones Documentaries like End game, they will still find this ""End Game: Blue Print for Global Enslavement"" documentary ties in well with Revelation from Charlie Daniels, and the Secret NWO History Exposed Documentary by Masters Degree Historian and film Maker Leonard Ulrich.",1491350400,4,2693,4.971175166297117

One thing that impressed me was that there is almost nothing cinematic in this.  Actual news and TV footage, historical images, images of news articles rather than a paraphrase of them, video of people in their own words.  Alex narrates, but he presents the evidence and lets it tell its own story, too.  It's very hard to take this as conspiracy theory when it's all there in plain historical black and white.  I've watched it twice now, and I got more out of it the second time than the first.  There's so much information that I couldn't absorb it all the first time around.  I showed it to my teenage kids.  One commented that he'd rather not know this stuff, but by the end of it, he understood why there is the need to be aware.

(you can look up Ezekial May 14, 1948 on google and see)  He also promised the church to come and get us.  I suggest  1 Thessalonians  4.13... and 2 Thess. 2.9-12.  John 3.16  It is a choice to believe in Jesus.  If you don't want to give up your life or your sin, tell Jesus.  He will certainly and lovingly help you.
Isaiah 46.9-10.  God says He tells the end from the beginning so we will know the Bible is His Word.  Deuteronomy 18.18-22.  He says that if any of a prophet's words don't come true, God didn't speak to him.

There may well be some kind of New World Order, but these Alex Jones nuts
have no idea what they are for or against or what the people they fight are even
representing.

We were on the way to a New World Order with Franklin Roosevelt, with the
New Deal, and the 4 Freedoms ... something that Jones alludes to in the opening
of this dork-u-mentary when he shows the film of Maj. General Smedley D. Butler
talking about the attempt at the time to overtly take over the US government.

That attempt failed, but did we go the way of FDR or did something else happen.
This, in the very first minutes of the neurotic dork-u-mentary is where the
coherence derails and it rockets in to hyperbolic foolishness ... meanwhile the
little snippets trying to paint Alex Jones as a true patriot are not lost.

This is Alex Jones trying to make himself leader or some kind of nut group,
like Glen Beck, or Rush Limbaugh, or Sean Hannity, etc.  These extremist
ignoramuses could well be the reason we will need a New World Order to
protect us from the foolish people who buy into their simple-minded fairy tales.

Anyway, not horrible, kind of entertaining in a funny way, and God help us if
there are groups of people out there who believe this stuff.  I think there are just
a lot of confused people who not longer get any news, journalism, civics, and

However I sometimes think he spouts a little too much non sense and that is why alot of the non believers think he is nuts. Like his famous, ""the answer to 1984 is 1776"", is completely ridiculous. The idiots who fought for freedom against the British and started the new country with declarations and laws were just as much hypocrites as their enemies. Rich Slave Owners telling the citizens of a new nation that all men are created equal. Except for anyone who wasn't white or any women or homosexuals. This country was founded on utter smelling B.S. and that is why it has fallen apart now. As for Alex screaming at these Bilderberg morons about them being taken down or arrested and things of that nature. The people in power will never be taken down unless the group lets it happen to certain ones they want to get rid of or replace. I hate to say it, but we are never going to win this because it is already over. This country is 99% zombie sheep that sit in their homes every night watching reality shows and believing whatever the news and our precious government tells them. You can see it not just in the news, but look at the article comments by people. Most of them are double digit I.Q. peons that haven't a clue what is really going on in the world. So sit back folks and buy some astroglide so it don't get too sore after their done screwing us.

The thing is, he's also largely telling the truth and for that alone he deserves a huge amount of credit. I'll give him his due. He's worth hearing.",1354320000,,564,4.65

2949573,1,B000VSDNHS,"Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is back at work, and his latest ""documentary"" is a doozy.  I put the word ""documentary"" in quotation marks because I can't even really say that this qualifies as a documentary.  Jones does a nice job putting the show together, but he fails to ever produce even one shread of evidence that could be called concrete or factual.  He shouts claims of conspiracies involving the ""elite,"" but fails to identify who they are, or elaborate on how they plan on wiping out over 80% of the world's population?  Jones provides experts with credentials that are sketchy, at best, if not down right ludacris.  And that is assuming that he even names his experts.  This movie would make a good plot for a Sy-Fy Channel original feature, but otherwise, it's laughable.",1345161600,12,798,4.788321167883212
2949574,5,B000VSDNHS,I urge EVERYONE to watch this movie.  It was one of the catalysts that opened my eyes and got me on the road to researching information presented in it.  Guess what?  It was telling the truth.  Please watch this movie.  It is well-filmed and well-put-together with historical fact and highly documented.,1344556800,,303,4.862745098039215
2949585,4,B000VSDNHS,"Alex Jones has been accused of all kinds of things... someday he will end up dead, just like the rest of the people that put their life on the line to tell the truth... disseminate lies, disinformation, and fight against corruption in government, and the people who don't have our interest in mind AT ALL but only do the bidding of the rich like puppets, who want more control, more control, more control. They already have all the resources horded in the world, so what left but a 1984 blueprint for ultimate control. We all have to open our mind to at least the possibility - simply compare how monitored we are now by technology to 30 years ago. Its common sense to come to the conclusion that people in power are going to use that to their advantage. And the government sector is decades beyond the public sector in technology.

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe everything Jones says, but I do know that what is conspiracy theory one day 10-30 years from then becomes common knowledge. Like I said, Jones has been accused of all kinds of things: a conspiracy theory hack, crazy, a fear monger (there are more fear mongers in government than the people trying to reveal these kind of secrets, let me tell you - remember the ridiculous color coded homeland security advisory system?), as well as being called an anti-Semite. He is none of these things. The last charge comes from ill-educated P.C. morons who are so quick to jump on the defense of anyone if political correctness line is passed or they think it is. Jones is not racist, he is an anti-Zionist, and an anti-Federalist and anti-Ruling Class system. Jewish dynasties happen to comprise some of this system that Jones is against. So if being anti federalist or anti Zionist makes you an anti-Semite, I guess I am too, even though that is ludicrous.

We all have to be open to these ideas, as far fetched as they seem, because, like I said, conspiracy theories often become common knowledge... dissemminated secrets, 5, 10 or 20 years later.

This film deserves a watch by just about everyone interested in the future of mankind and which way it could go, which should be all of us. So are the zeitgeist films, all three... I don't buy all of the religious claims and sometimes atheist themes in Zeitgeist, though I am certain that religion has been used throughout time by governments/ruling class to control people, but you don't have to ascribe to all of that to take what is the true from these movies, mostly the dissemination of lies. This film and the three Zeitgeists (which can be watched for free streamed online from their website) are a great compendium for anyone interested in ""conspiracy theory,"" new world order theories and what the richest of the rich are up to (and I don't mean Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey, but the Rockerfellers, the Vanderbelts, the Rothschilds, the JP Morgans, the Billderberg group, the organizations that run the world that are run by these people, such as the world bank, the WTO (World Trade Organizations), NAFTA, NATO, etc, and the hidden networks used between them (that have been historically known as the illuminati, the free masons, etc.)

Its reasonable to have what some would consider a ""balanced"" opinion of Jones and this film - ""take it for what it is"" ""there's truth in it, but there's not a global conspiracy"" - but to the folks that give the film one star and call him a nut job, they've been fed the lies, ate them and been poisoned by them i.e. conditioned, and not open to question anything, and don't realize that we need people like Alex Jones to dig up hidden truths - people that think their governments tell them everything, or the things they don't tell them are simple matters of security, and that there aren't people out there with agendas that are bad for mankind, they are the most naive people on the planet. EVERYTHING'S OKAY! How gullible can a person be. There's also a damn good reason this film has four and a half stars average with hundreds of reviews. There's an old saying... READ A BOOK! And not just your business books that tell you how to climb the company ladder and be the best cog you can be.

Give this film a chance, because MANY of your republicans aren't republicans anymore, they are neo-cons who don't stand for the old GOP values such as small government or our second amendment rights, but rather Federalists who want to control the population through big government, and many of the democrats aren't who they once were either - people for social freedoms and social assistance, but they're virtually the same thing as the Republicans: Federalists who only have the interest of the rich (who funded their elections) in mind and therefore do their bidding. Just look at the current and last failure... This movie sheds light on why things are the way they are, and the middle class is disappearing... More calculating goes on behind closed doors than any of us would ever want to know, but if we become educated, we might be able to change what is destroying our country and the world. Final words, watch this movie, as well as the zeitgeists!!!",1337990400,5,5108,4.658536585365853
2949586,2,B000VSDNHS,"I'll be brief and try not to repeat points that others have made. As far as I can see, conservatives, are not good at promoting conspiracy theories - I say that he must be a Republican because he holds those conservative sacred principles: protectionism: we white Europeans conquered the United States a few hundred years ago, therefore we own it: the need to keep foreigners out: the Bilderbergers want to take our guns away: God is on our side: we should be able to do what ever we want: we shouldn't have to pay taxes: among others. These to me are not admirable principles.

 Alex Jones, doesn't seem able to separate the ""wheat from the chaff"". He mixes truth with with fiction, takes many things out of context less skillfully than Michael Moore and often ""throws the baby out with the bathwater"", like when he lumps together those that have committed holocausts and eugenics experiments with those that promote responsible birth control such as ""Planed Parenthood"", branding them all evil.

 His theories lack any evidence and he posses no alternatives. I suppose he is a textbook anarchist with a heightened sense of self-importance.

 I give it an extra star for the interesting archival footage. The film was fairly entertaining, but the lack of a consistent message resulted in me not being able to take it seriously. I am baffled at so many five star ratings. So many people seem to mix up emotions with reason. America is filled with much pain and fear. I am glad I am not a citizen that country.",1326326400,6,1509,4.718631178707224

2949589,1,B000VSDNHS,"Seems like everyone pretty much just eats this up, like there really is global threat of an evil finacial empire capable of enslaving the enire population ultimately.  This is the ultimate conspiracy theory to end all of em I guess. It would almost be comical if it were no so sad that overwhelmingly we have just missed the whole thing! Our problem is never about what evil people can do, I mean make no mistake, I am not denying the fact that there really ARE people that think in these grand terms, because of course there are.  HOWEVER the entity that we really ought to focus on is God and NOT man!  It is entirely, completly at God's whim to at any moment remove various people from power and install whom He wills to! God is our problem, not our fellow human beings with grandiose ideas! The Bible is telling us this in passages like Daniel 2:21  ""...He removeth kings, and setteth up kings...blessed be the name of God for ever and ever...""

  In fact when we carry on like folks do in the film, focusing all on man's power to threaten people and man's power to overcome those who enslave their fellow man without acknowleding the complete and sovereign right and ability that God alone posses to allow, prohibit, or flat out cause whatever is to be then we are denying that God is GOD!  Human being's can do NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING unless God willfully allows it!  It is just pride in our pathetic ability to believe otherwise!  It is the same pride at work in fearing our evil fellow man as it is to think we could defeat some evil government if they grabbed power.  After reading and studying the Bible for years I continually convinced that all of our problems, all of our woes in everything from rust to cancer, to the tyranny of evil rulers, ALL of these things are heaped upon us for our sin!  We SHOULD all respond to it by falling on our faces in the dirt, in tears of repentence begging Almighty God for mercy we in no way deserve!  THAT is how each and every one us SHOULD respond to our plight!  Do we?  Look around.  We not only don't humble ourselves trembling, no we just heap sin upon sin, we just keep pushing God out of the equations, either that or we ignore (or outright deny) the authority of the Bible and re-create God in a way that pleases our sensibilities.  Many see man as basically good and God just loving them no matter what and they ascribe all the bad things to an ultra powerful evil force the Devil who creates all the disease and creates all of our dreadful plagues and problems...this is a weak god that loves us and really wants to help but can only do so if we do our part too. This is that same sinful wicked pride just dressed up to look holy, and so are myraids of various concoctions of of man's evil imagination to work out in all the other ways we can dream up too.  But nothing changes the truth. We can't hide from the truth long either for death is right there on the horizon for each of us.  Balk if you want, slander and ridicule me for saying these things if it makes you feel justified too.  And then just watch your life ebb away into disease and death.  Watch as the work of your hands is spoiled or given to another. Just take your pride kicking and screaming into the judgment of destruction that sits upon  mankind since the garden. The truth is we come right from the womb speaking lies in our heart.  The only thing that could save any of us is an outright miracle.  The word ""grace"" that is flouted all over the place means ""unmerited favor"" God's grace in the miracle of salvation is to take some people, who are in no wise better than anyone else and against their evil nature, in spite of the fact that they would never truly repent and come to God begging for mercy confessing they had nothing to commend themselves, that He would take these people one by one out from among the nations in which they are dispersed and miraculously take away their dead stony heart and give them a new and living heart to want truth. THAT is grace! That is the miracle that is of the Lord Jesus Christ, God rooted into the seed of man, the fullness of the eternal Godhead manifest into the heart of a human being provided by God as the only just sacrifice to make the saving of some of us possible.  I can say these words, but I do not really understand how it is possible!  I do not at all claim to know how in the world Jesus could have been fully eternal God yet stripped of everything and actually existing as a human being exactly like all of us in every way, tested in every way as we are yet totally maintaining perfect righteousness. Personally I do not see how Jesus could even have known who He really was, but would have to have learned each thing according to God's grace. How is that possible that the eternal infiniite Creator of EVERYTHING would be stripped of everything but His soul, AS A HUMAN BEING in a body of death?  I have not the slighest hint of an idea how it could be but He was what He was and is what He IS!  Put off these pridefull fears of man and fear God!  Read the Bible and BEG for His mercy! For all you know, if you can even do this, perhaps you too are being drawn by the Father to Christ?  I think there is the real probability that Oct 21 of THIS year is the final judgement of this world! It makes abundant sense to me anyway!",1308960000,2,5325,4.274900398406374

I usually wouldn't point out lack of production value or any other faux redeeming qualities but since this film lacks any coherent argument or fact backed argument I'm forced to point out all of its flaws. I'm a huge fan of documentaries, huge fan of the statement this movie was supposed to make and argue however the execution is so poor that you'd be better off just not watching anything. It's funny, Alex Jones does such a horrid job proving his point, and instead self promoting him and his amateur hour ostracized third rate journalist buddies that you start to route against them and instead are relieved by the films sole plot: that these subpar anarchist are desperate for an excuse for their present situation's and turn the blame on others.",1239667200,25,919,4.786163522012578

The whole NWO idea is a Jewish idea not Bush's or Obama's or any elite bankers that help manipulate the market today. This idea of enslaving every one with high usury interest is an old Jewish trick! Deceit is an art that true cons know how to use on high levels and the masters are the Jews who control all the major banks in the world.

2949681,5,B000VSDNHS,"_Endgame:  Blueprint for Global Enslavement_ (2007) by film maker Alex Jones is a decent film showing the history of the Bilderbergers, the secret yearly meetings of the world's elite.  I agree with Jones that the Bilderbergers are definitely up to no good.  As Jim Tucker, a reporter who has spent years following them, says in the film, ""They are plotting in secrecy because they are plotting evil.  Good works are done in the sunshine.""  Jones also does a good job of showing how the elite plan to use eugenics to decimate the world's population.  Concerns about overpopulation and environmentalism are cynically exploited by the world's ultra-rich elite to justify eugenics and murder.  Jones shows us how both presidents Bush and Clinton have been in on this scheme and have sought to achieve a ""new world order"".  My main and only criticism of this film is Jones' style.  Because Jones is so confrontational and does completely idiotic things like harassing people on street corners or stalking celebrities, he ends up coming off more as an unhinged nut than a serious individual and ends up just making a public menace of himself.  Also some of the claims in this film may be exaggerated, although I agree with its general message.",1233273600,,1238,4.908653846153846

Endgame is like another bookend, holding together the fear and lies that engulf this country.

I've heard of the New World Order and always thought of it similar to the Nazi-ruling of the 40's across Europe; their unrelenting, unsatiable lust for power that has no limits, and can only stop once it's been overtaken/overthrown. And what usually happens in that case is just a cycle of greed; people starting out with good intentions but eventually become corrupt by the very system by which they've escaped from. Endgame takes us through various points in history at the development of this NWO and spends a good amount of time detailing the Bilderberg Group and it's role in global enslavement.

There is an enormous amount of information to take in, but when you look at it in comparision to the events that are happening today, you can see it all making sense. I consider this a buy at best, a rental at least. The NWO count on their secrecy, on people like us not knowing what's going on. It's better for them to use their resources (US) without us knowing about it. otherwise they wouldn't survive.

This is about the Bilderberg Group and their plan for global domination. I understand corporatocracy and NAFTA, but how much deeper does this go? I've heard of the FEMA prisons, the North American Union (US, Canada, Mexico all one nation), and the trans-Texas corridor, and I sense that national sovereignties are dissolving into a class war of elite billionaires versus the populace, but I thought the elites were just powerful and greedy, not a self-proclaimed superior race. (Think eugenics & Nazism.) This does explain their Calvinistic beliefs of being favored by God and more deserving than other people.

I'm shocked to hear that the U.N. and E.U. are part of the master plan. I begin to doubt when he talks about the fomenting of illegal immigration and 'Reconquista' (Mexico's reconquering of California) as a means to weaken US democracy. Call me wicked, but I AGREE with the need for birth control and that it's immoral for a couple to purposely have more than two children. Supplying birth control to poor countries is a GOOD thing for everyone, and his criticism of Planned Parenthood raises my suspicions of him.

Finally, he loses me all together when he says that global warming is due only to the sun having gotten hotter and that they concocted it to support carbon taxes to fund their conquest. Also, I just can't buy that the Sierra Club is part of their devious plan to de-populate and re-wilderness the U.S.

2949710,5,B000VSDNHS,"It's still amazing to me that we can live in the most information rich generation in the history of the world, and so many people can remain ignorant of the truth. The fact that a ""New World Order"" has been aggressively in the works for the past century is not that difficult to discover - many of those involved have stated their goals openly and clearly. The famed scientist Albert Einstein once stated; ""Mankind's desire for peace can be realized only by the creation of a world government ... with all my heart I believe that the world's present system of sovereign nations can only lead to barbarism, war, and inhumanity, and that only law can assure progress toward a civilized peaceful humanity.""  Winston Churchill was once quoted as saying; ""The creation of an authoritative world order is the ultimate aim toward which we must strive.""  These kind of quotes by noted influential leaders are not hard to find. The thing that makes this somehow ""hard to believe"" for many is ""why"" this stuff doesn't get reported on the nightly news. But the answer is obvious; those orchestrating the move towards world government do not want this to be public knowledge. The transition from national sovereignty to global governance is accomplished much easier through subtlety rather than blatancy.  However, rather than admit that a (dare I say) ""conspiracy"" [gasp!] is afoot, many willingly choose to be ignorant of the facts. Fortunately, thanks to people like Alex Jones, Americans (and others who love their country) don't have to rely on CNN for the REAL NEWS. No, believe it or not, the real news is not trivial garbage like how much Brittany Spear's chew gum sold for on Ebay. The REAL NEWS is ""why"" the US government absolutely refuses to do anything about the mass influx of ILLEGAL aliens into America. The REAL NEWS is ""why"" a massive tri-national highway is being built right through the heart of America and nobody's saying anything about it (except our beloved fellow Americans in Texas).  If you want answers to all the news-media blackouts, then get a copy of Alex Jones' ENDGAME. You may not like what you wake-up to, but at least your eyes will be opened. A+ Highly Recommended!

I also wanted to offer a couple of criticisms of the ""Endgame.""  Despite how it is framed by this film, Planned Parenthood is doing a lot of good in the world, providing sex education and a range of health screenings&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacred-Work-Planned-Parenthood-And-Its-Clergy-Alliances/dp/0813539501/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacred Work: Planned Parenthood And Its Clergy Alliances</a>.  Watching this film, one would think Planned Parenthood is out to impose an evil eugenics plan - a bit over the top to anyone with the vaguest familiarity with the organization.
""Endgame"" also portrays the ""rewilding"" of the U.S. as necessarily a terrible thing.  I agree that it's a shame that we've been losing so many farmers and rural communities, largely due to the consolidating machinations of agribusiness&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Future-of-Food/dp/B000V5IOWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Future of Food</a>; but there is a sort of rewilding that this country would benefit from.

Dave Foreman has written an interesting book on how rewilding the country could restore countless habitats and animals, and enrich the lives of humans&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rewilding-North-America-A-Vision-For-Conservation-In-The-21St-Century/dp/1559630612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rewilding North America: A Vision For Conservation In The 21St Century</a>.  This film tries to frame ""biodiversity"" as something sinister, when it's actually something we and non-human species need to thrive.  See any of the excellent presentations by Vandana Shiva on YouTube or her many books like ""Biopiracy.""  Shiva is always challenging the lawyers and lobbyists who serve corporations like Monsanto and Dow, and she understands what a threat they are to biodiversity.  The corporate world order seeks monoculture and conformity, not the biodiversity that we need to protect and/or restore.
There is a pattern in this film to portray things in the most menacing way possible.  It's kind of manipulative.  One other example of this is the portrayal of the United Nations, complete with the skull imposed on the UN building on the cover of the DVD.  Despite the skull and the spooky coloring, there are actually some people doing good work within the United Nations, particularly in the General Assembly which is often challenging the schemes of the rich and violent nations of the ""security"" council.  There is no fiercer critic of the UN than Phyllis Bennis, but she recognizes the efforts and the opportunities that exist within that flawed institution&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Challenging-Empire-How-People-Governments-and-the-UN-Defy-US-Power/dp/156656607X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Challenging Empire: How People, Governments, and the UN Defy US Power</a>.
My last criticism is actually a note of optimism.  That is, there are many ways to challenge the elite, or to somehow contribute to a better world.  The Global South, which suffers the most from the plans of the corporate aristocracy, has a lot to teach us about the struggle for freedom.  Resistance is flourishing in the form of figures like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hugo-Chavez-The-Bolivarian-Revolution-in-Venezuela/dp/1844675335/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela</a>, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Fernando Lugo in Paraguay. Meanwhile, movements like the Landless Workers Movement and the participatory democracy in cities like Porto Alegre, Brazil are powerful illustrations that the world's people aren't as pacified as they sometimes appear.

  Alex Jone's ""Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement"" is not a good first encounter to this information. His passion for informing the people I applaud, but some of his over the top megaphone usage will probably turn off most new comers to this subject matter. For a good over view of The Bilderberg group and the up coming one world government I would suggest Aaron Russo's ""America: Freedom To Fascism"", and read The Naked Capitalist by W. Cleon Skoussen.

  Having said that ""Endgame"" is top notch in it's production, content, and ability to scare the daylights out of you. What you will find as you watch this is a short history of totalitarianism, socialism, feudalism, and the blueprint for the mind set for a ruthless dictator. Alex Jones then ties all of it together into our time with a group of Global Elites who are at this very moment setting up the foundation of The New World Order... National microchiped I.D. cards within a couple of years so they can track you everywhere you go. Discussions of implantable microchips in all society...

The end of America as we know it as it gets absorbed into the North American Union. A lot of this stuff has even been covered briefly by the news media... My short review can't do this documentary justice. I just don't happen to think it's the best one if this is your first look at this material. Buy it, and watch it after you look at a couple others...

I would also suggest G. Edward Griffins, ""The Creature From Jeckyll Islan""",1214006400,6,1995,4.699140401146132
2949733,1,B000VSDNHS,"I didn't actually buy or rent this documentary.  A student of mine (high school) suggested that I watch it,  and he loaned it to me.  It is good for a few laughs due more to its over-the-top, apocalyptic tone, but as a serious documentary it doesn't work--and that is being very kind.

One previous reviewer said it best--rather than serious journalism, it comes off more like a horror story best told around a Halloween campfire.  Dark plots, secret societies, wicked schemes spanning generations, peculiar connections between public figures, eerie parallels between past and present. . .all of these abound in this film, and certain doom awaits humanity unless the masses unite to counteract the nefarious goals of said plots, societies, and schemes.  I admit that some of it can be entertaining, but very little of it is serious.

In truth, the entire documentary rests on a smattering of recent politics (you'll see footage of both Bushes, Richard Holbrooke, Henry Kissinger), economics (NAFTA, the EU), and history (abundant footage of past dictators Zedong, Stalin, Hitler).  Using this material, it then tries to spin off a tale of impending world conquest, doom, destruction, slavery, and oppression.  Specifically, the video and its producer, Alex Jones, attempt to convince viewers of the existence of a sinister conspiracy to create a ""New World Order,"" in which a secret cadre of predatory business and political elites (Jones accuses David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger of belonging to the cadre, but--whoops--never offers any proof), operating according to the dictates of some master plan (Jones theatrically calls it a master plan as he conjectures wildly about what it consists of), are at this very moment working to 1) Destroy national boundaries and establish a world government 2) Reduce world population to a manageable level of 500 million 3) Reduce the world's inhabitants to slave laborers or something akin to slave laborers.  I'm obviously over-simplifying things some, but that's the core of the theory.

It's a lunatic theory, and Jones never comes close in this documentary to offering any hard proof of it.  Nor could he have.  The few interviews that he conducts are people who are obviously as paranoid, anxious, and conspiracy-minded as he is and give the viewer no assurance that Jones or anyone close to him have a hold on reality.  Jones then compounds his credibility problem by jumping from one big idea to the next, ending the film with a discussion of past eugenics programs and claiming that China's 1 child per family rule is actually part of the New World Order's master plan to de-populate the world.

Well, anyway. . .I don't understand how a documentary with such a crazed mentality can earn so many 4-star and 5-star reviews.  But on this one, I'll gladly take my place with the minority.",1212883200,37,2838,5.05793991416309

2949758,4,B000VSDNHS,"Alex Jones is far less credible, however, when he attempts to weave all of these facts into a broad ""master plan for world domination."" Many of his conclusions seem to stand cause and effect on their heads, while others seem to reflect a strong personal, and likely religious bias. For example, Jones and his supporters dismiss all of the crises we face in the coming century - fossil fuel depletion, climate change, global warming, declining supplies of food and fresh water world-wide - as nothing but hoaxes concocted by the global elite as the premise for bringing about their plans for world domination, despite the existence massive volumes of evidence that would suggest exactly the opposite. He has a special contempt for environmentalists of any stripe, universally condemning them as a vital part of the global elites' plan. This is ironic, considering that many environmentalists, peak oilers, human rights activists etc. sound the same warnings of economic chaos, rising police states world-wide, and population collapse Jones himself does, howbeit for somewhat different reasons. While I have not read much about Jones' personal religious views, what he says in much of his work is very much in harmony with Christian Fundamentalist groups in my part of the country, which would provide a clear explanation for this.

Jones is also well-known for highly selective use of quotations by well-known figures to support his theories, while ignoring many other things they also said. For example it is completely true that Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and H.G. Wells, (among many others) were staunch supporters of eugenics - in its early days. What wasn't mentioned,however, was that every one of them totally renounced that support as they came to realize the terrible acts and policies eugenics could be used to justify. Aldous Huxley, for example, wrote Brave New World in the 30's as a cautionary tale - a warning of the terrible things that could happen if the theories of eugenics, organic evolution etc were taken to certain logical extremes. Bertrand Russell fiercely denounced Hitler and the Nazi movement from its very beginnings, and his name appeared prominently at the top of a Gestapo list of people to be executed immediately when the Nazis succeeded in taking Britain.

A final, major annoyance in this film is the disproportionate amount of time devoted to Jones ranting on a bullhorn at the Bilderberg delegates in Ottawa. Most of his taunts,such as ""we're not your slaves,"" and ""the answer to 1984 is 1776"" are downright pathetic, and help brand Jones as a 'paranoid whack job.' Small wonder the Bilderbergs and other global elites are content to completely ignore him.

Despite these criticisms, I recommend End Game as a five-star film. Here's why.

If End Game weren't presented as a documentary, I would still recommend it as the best Science Fiction film I had seen in many years. I mean no disrespect when I say this. Science fiction (not the Sci-fi Channel crap, the real thing) in its highest form is better called speculative fiction...it asks the question 'what if...?' and then produces a story that attempts to answer it. Even as fiction End Game is a chilling and provocative story. Science fiction, after all, doesn't describe something that is actually happening, but rather something that theoretically/reasonably could happen.

So, what if?

What if a small group of people actually did want to dominate the world? What if they had learned the lessons of history and understood that no single nation or political entity could ever accomplish it. How would they pull it off?

Suppose this international group, bound not by nationality or ethnic affiliation but rather by a common world-view, realized that the way to world domination lay in taking total control of the world's financial infrastructure - its central banks, stock markets, and lending institutions, rather than by military conquest. And what if, for the first time in human history, the technology existed to actually carry out their plans...to shape public opinion, to form corporations richer and more influential than most of the world's governments, and to control the policies of the rest through foreign aid, trade and debt? What if...?

What if...?

...despite the limitations and blatant silliness in many parts of End Game, Alex Jones turns out to be even partially right (and I believe he is)? After all, just because you're a paranoid whack-job doesn't mean someone isn't out to get you.

And fleas, no matter what conclusions you draw about them, do bite.",1211155200,2,4594,5.097074468085107

The facts are scary enough, just present them in a way that makes sense and is honest.  The film draws you in from the start, and then screeches to a halt outside the hotel in Montreal.  If you don't get bored here, or disgusted by Jones' antics, what follows is interesting and informative.

I think Mr. Jones should hire a good editor and revise this film.  The Montreal section could have really been tightened up and shortened by at least half without losing anything.  Show who is attending, why that is important.  Cut out the bullhorn and the taunting of the folks in limos, it adds nothing and really hurts the credibility of the film.  Same with the preaching to the regular folks on the street.  I think it's pretty obvious that most people don't know about the Bilderberg Group, so it doesn't really need to be illustrated in the film, at least not in the way they chose to.  Cut these scenes and replace them with more history, more documentation.

2949779,5,B000VSDNHS,"As unbelievable as it may sound, the global elite has a plan to reduce Earth's population by 90%.  In this film, Alex thoroughly documents their plan to do so.  After watching this, no reasonable person can deny this.

All throughout history, as governments gained more power over their people, they began genocidal programs.  These include 60 million in Mao's China, 20 million in Stalin's Russia, 10 Million in Hitler's Germany and many more including 300 million people in the 20th century.  What is most concerning is that these genocidal programs are all related and have become more sophisticated over the years.  The same families and groups have been behind these events and the past instances have been planning, preparation and dress rehearsal for their big event.

So many of the ""world elite"" have said that they want to reduce Earth's population by 90% (500 million) that it is mind boggling.  They often refer to the average person on the street as ""cattle"" or ""useless eater"".  When they meet behind closed doors, they make plans to carry out their genocidal policy.  The movie starts out with Alex exposing their ""secret"" meetings and shows them scurrying around like rats trying to hide from the cameras.

I've studied these parasites which call themselves ""the elite"" for many years.  Endgame is a brilliant work which does an excellent job of exposing their activities.  To document their plans in undeniable detail is truly a monumental task and my hat is off to Endgame.

After viewing Engame, I'm still not sure.  Of course everything he says is true - in the sense that there have always been and always will be those who wish to take over the world, as well as those who wish to experiment on, to create a ""better"" version of, and even to destroy most of humanity.  Read up on Robespierre sometime: his ultimate goal was to kill everyone on earth but he and his wife, who would then proceed to re-populate the world with their offspring - just like Adam and Eve.  And, yes, for the first time in history, there actually is the means to accomplish the destruction of the human race.  I have no doubt that pockets of the world's elites constantly plan how to deal with one or another possible catastrophe - such as climate change, which now seems the most likely catastrophe (although Alex Jones believes that climate change, like the entire environmental movement - and even Evolution - is merely a way of duping people into accepting the elites' agenda).  Nor do I doubt for a second that these oligarchs fully understand what may very well happen when the planet heats up, and are actively planning to somehow maintain law and order in the midst of the inevitable chaos.  I'm sure the ruling classes have hundreds of scientists and other professional thinkers on their payroll working day and night to draw up contingency plans to deal with every conceivable catastrophe.  That doesn't mean they intend to put these plans into effect whether there's a catastrophe or not; it simply means that, once again, as humans have done since the dawn of history, they're trying to hold back the inevitable.  They're trying to preserve their personal empires no matter what happens to the rest of the world.  How many times have we seen something like that in the movies?  And, if history is any indication, it doesn't work in real life any better than it does in the movies.  So, yes, be every bit as afraid of these Bilderberg hobgoblins as you would of a marauding horde of Vikings descending on your town; just don't endow them with superhuman or supernatural powers.  They're not the X-Men - no matter how much wealth and power they may have.  If a catastrophe truly is in our future (such as a gamma ray burst or an asteroid collision or even a plague that they themselves unleashed), the Bilderbegs can no more escape the aftermath than the poorest peasant.  They can run but they can't hide.  There's nothing they can do to preserve their empires so much as one second past the appointed hour of their collapse.",1200873600,10,2825,4.642570281124498

This film is doubtlessly over-the-top, but we live in a particularly evil time period where the convergence of different nations into superstates, as well as the rapid progress of control-oriented technology, have served to place humanity in greater jeopardy than perhaps ever before.  This reviewer often wonders if the events of the 20th Century actually took place -- if Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and other mass murderers are only a figment of his imagination.  Most people have learned absolutely nothing from the horrendous crimes these psychopaths committed against humanity (thanks in large part to a school system and mainstream media establishment that serves the interests of the state, rather than the people).  Americans have been successfully conditioned to believe that this nation has a government that is somehow superior to all others, despite the fact that it has engaged in numerous misadventures that have resulted in the mass slaughters of millions of foreigners and thousands of American soldiers.  The U.S. Government is the most treasonous, anti-American institution on the planet.

Mr. Jones' strong grasp of history lends him a credibility that surpasses that of many professional historians -- most of whom are shameless worshippers of government power.  Jones gives the banking cartels and the corporations that own the government their just comeuppance.  Throughout the last couple centuries these institutions have worked for nothing but their own power-hungry purposes -- demonstrating no loyalty to anything other than the pursuit of profit -- to the extreme detriment of mankind.  IBM is singled out for particular reprimand for its partnership with Nazi Germany.  The documentary also rightfully takes the scientific community to task for having engineered the eugenics movement and manipulating the cause of environmentalism to facilitate greater control of the species.  Jones lays out these facts very effectively and shows that his paranoia is not so unreasonable after all.

Where the film falls short is in its depiction of the Bilderberg Group.  Part of the shortcoming here is a product of the group's incredibly secretive nature; it is impossible for an outsider to know exactly what goes on in these meetings.  As a result, one can only guess as to how concerned we should be with this gaggle of international conspirators.  The fact that super-villain Henry Kissinger attends these conferences is scary in and of itself.  Kissinger is bashed several times during ENDGAME, which is another plus of the film.  This sickening neo-fascist has repeatedly promoted the disgustingly inhumane and racist policy of depopulating Africa while also praising the push for a New World Order.  This vampire is the perfect representative of all that is wrong with  political power lust and the vicious costs it exacts on mankind.

This film is highly recommended.  It makes a great case against massive government and for the federalism -- the splitting up of power between federal, state, and local -- upon which this nation was supposed to be founded.  Call Alex Jones a kook, a conspiracy nut, an agitator, or some other pejorative label; regardless of the truth of such accusations, his patriotism is beyond reproach.  And his documentary is intriguing and informative and it should be taken seriously by all those who do not want to live under a fascist one-world state.",1198022400,7,3584,5.291519434628976

This film documents the history and corruption of the big banks of world.  How they have funded both sides of every war dating back to Nepolean days.
It goes on to talk about the North American Union, NAFTA superhighway, and the plan to depopulate the planet by 80%.  This documentary will open the eyes of anyone who is unfamiliar with this stuff and is very well made.  It gets a little long towards the end, so watching it twice will for sure be the best.
I highly recommend you check out this film, along with Terrorstorm: A history of governmnet sponsored terror.

I thought the first part of the film was a little slow because I already have researched and accept the reality of the Bilderburgers and CFR groups.

But boy, the second part has opened my eyes.  The facts of life came at me hard and fast.  Eugenics sounds sensible on the face of it.  Two people with a week or defective genealogy will likely produce the same in their offspring. The frightening point of the movie is that skin color eye color, body type or ethnicity could be considered weak or defective.  The reality of the elite's population reduction came home to me and there is no denying what they are planning after checking on Mr. Jones' research.

2949851,4,B000VSDNHS,"This is a very good overview of what is happening, and has happened in recent times that clearly point to a global plan drawn up by, and executed by, global elites and those they control.
This Alex Jones production makes clear connections between some well known, and some not so well known, major events in the 20th century and connects the dots to events taking place around us now. If you don't know who the ""Bilderbergers"" are, and how much they control, you will by the films end. The secret groups, secret agreements and the visible consequences of these, are revealed to a great extent.
It does an excellent job of revealing how the elitists of society have come together to control the path of economics, politics, our dwindling freedoms,wars,eugenics (decreasing the population of the world through selective methods),religion, and what their possible plans are for us in the near future.
The documentary includes interviews with those who have studied globalism and the elites of the world for many years, as well as other well educated and some well known personalities who are not afraid to speak their mind on this subject.
This film will shock those who are not aware of what is going on behind the scenes in world events. It will give you a lot to consider, and will at times frighten you to realize how much control globalist desire over our individual lives.
My only criticism of the film is that I think Mr. Jones did spend a little too much time filming his, and others experiences at the Bilderberg meetings in Ottawa and in Turkey. Most of these sections of the film don't really add a greater appreciation of what the entire film is focused on. I think some of those sections of the film would have been better used to give more time talking to other experts and going into some deeper history of and detail of what globalism is going to mean for all of us.
Personally I would have liked to see more time spent on discussing the speeches by Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy during their presidencies that warned America and the world of the elitists plans.

End Game is a well crafted and informative expose of various aspects of the fascist/collectivist eugenicist  power play that is currently unfolding behind closed doors. It's a nail in the coffin for those poor and deluded folk who have ,in many respects,deified man and refuse to recognise his darker and more perverse nature which seems to be amplified in those people who wield power.
People need to set aside their rose tinted spectacles and watch this film with an open mind. Of course,it's nigh on impossible to cover all aspects of the tyranny that is being imposed on nations in one film but this is a good place to start and will open doors elsewhere. I would combine this movie with a viewing of ""Terror storm"" ,again from the Alex Jones stable,the Youtube Audio interview with Naomi Wolf and Jones and the Channel 4 produced documentary,""The great global warming swindle"" Just these few sources of information will help to form a more cohesive picture of what is going on with our societies.

2949925,5,B000VSDNHS,"Whenever I see anything by Alex Jones, I can't help but think of a story I heard years ago that supposedly happened in New Guinea. Seems that when the first medical missionaries went into the highlands, the tribes were deeply suspicious of them, and doubted that their medicine was any good. When the missionaries finally discovered the reason why, they were astonished.

Apparently villages in the New Guinea highlands were (and still are today) heavily infested with fleas that bite pigs, dogs and humans alike. The New Guinea tribesmen, who were natural skilled observers, were quite familiar with the habits of these fleas and knew that every healthy human and animal would have no small number of them. They also noted correctly that whenever anyone got sick, the fleas immediately fled them for another host. However, these tribesmen weren't quite so good at drawing accurate conclusions from their observations. At some point they decided that since only healthy animals and people had fleas, the fleas must be the cause of their good health. Everyone should have them! The missionaries didn't, so...

So it is with Jones. Every time I see one his films (and End Game is, in every sense, his best film to date) I am amazed and fascinated at the impressive body of facts he gathers together. The Bilderberg group does, in fact, exist and meets in extreme secrecy precisely as described in the film. His description of how Rothchilds' crashed and then bought up the British economy for pennies on the dollar is historical fact. It is no secret that certain banks and other financial institutions have funded both sides of nearly every major war in the 20th century, and the U.S. has a long history of arming both sides of national and regional conflicts. The Georgia Guidestones and their peculiar origins are real...Google Earth will take you right to them. The 1974 Kissinger report which mentions the need for depopulation exists (I've read it in its entirety).  Jones' background research for this film  is easily confirmed at any local library and generally impeccable.

Alex Jones is far less credible, however, when he attempts to weave all of these facts into a broad ""master plan for world domination."" Many of his conclusions seem to stand cause and effect on their heads, while others seem to reflect a strong personal, and likely religious bias. For example, Jones and his supporters dismiss all of the crises we face in the coming century - fossil fuel depletion, climate change, global warming, declining supplies of food and fresh water world-wide - as nothing but hoaxes concocted by the global elite as the premise for bringing about their plans for world domination, despite the existence massive volumes of evidence that would suggest exactly the opposite. He has a special contempt for environmentalists of any stripe, universally condemning them as a vital part of the global elites' plan. This is ironic, considering that many environmentalists, peak oilers, human rights activists etc. sound the same warnings of economic chaos, rising police states world-wide, and population collapse Jones himself does, howbeit for somewhat different reasons. While I have not read much about Jones' personal religious views, what he says in much of his work is very much in harmony with  Christian Fundamentalist groups in my part of the country, which would provide a clear explanation for this.

Jones is also well-known for highly selective use of quotations by well-known figures to support his theories, while ignoring many other things they also said. For example it is completely true that Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and H.G. Wells, (among many others)  were staunch supporters of eugenics - in its early days.  What wasn't mentioned,however, was that every one of them totally renounced that support as they came to realize the terrible acts and policies eugenics could be used to justify. Aldous Huxley, for example, wrote Brave New World in the 30's as a cautionary tale - a warning of the terrible things that could happen if the theories of eugenics, organic evolution etc were taken to certain logical extremes. Bertrand Russell fiercely denounced Hitler and the Nazi movement from its very beginnings, and his name appeared prominently at the top of a Gestapo list of people to be executed immediately when the Nazis succeeded in taking Britain.

A final, major annoyance in this film is the disproportionate amount of time devoted to Jones ranting on a bullhorn at the Bilderberg  delegates in Ottawa. Most of his taunts,such as ""we're not your slaves,"" and ""the answer to 1984 is 1776"" are downright pathetic, and help brand Jones as a 'paranoid whack job.' Small wonder the Bilderbergs and other global elites are content to completely ignore him.

Despite these criticisms, I recommend End Game as a five-star film. Here's why.

If End Game weren't presented as a documentary, I would still recommend it as the best Science Fiction film I had seen in many years. I mean no disrespect when I say this. Science fiction (not the Sci-fi Channel crap, the real thing) in its highest form is better called speculative fiction...it asks the question 'what if...?' and then produces a story that attempts to answer it. Even as fiction End Game is a chilling and provocative story. Science fiction, after all, doesn't describe something that is actually happening, but rather something that theoretically/reasonably could happen.

So, what if?

What if a small group of people actually did want to dominate the world? What if they had learned the lessons of history and understood that no single nation or political entity could ever accomplish it. How would they pull it off?

Suppose this international group, bound not by nationality or ethnic affiliation but rather by a common world-view, realized that the way to world domination lay in taking total control of the world's financial infrastructure - its central banks, stock markets, and lending institutions, rather than by military conquest. And what if, for the first time in human history, the technology existed to actually carry out their plans...to shape public opinion, to form corporations richer and more influential than most of the world's governments, and to control the policies of the rest through foreign aid, trade and debt?  What if...?

What if...?

...despite the limitations and blatant silliness in many parts of End Game, Alex Jones turns out to be even partially right (and I believe he is)? After all, just because you're a paranoid whack-job doesn't mean someone isn't out to get you.

And fleas, no matter what conclusions you draw about them, do bite.",1196294400,27,6680,5.060964513193812

2949929,4,B000VSDNHS,"Alex Jones is a radio host and documentary film maker based out of Austin, Texas.  His documentaries revolve around the global movements that led to the European Union, the United Nations, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers and other opinion and policy making groups bent on dominating the world.

This particular documentary, his newest, looks at the 'New World' nirvana proposed by the elite of the world.

The first question that needs to be answered is, ""Are there really conspiracies bent on world domination?""  Well, since these organizations themselves admit and publish this publicly, only a fool would say no.  David Rockefeller, founding member of many of these globalist secret combinations, stated flat out in his recent biography that global domination was exactly what he has been working for.

Understand that there are kooks out there who believe all kinds of weird stuff from alien abductions to ESP and paganism.  Alex Jones is not one of these people.

This documentary follows a meeting of the ""Bilderbergers"", a group of secretive policy makers including heads of industry and state.  This documentary details the ""eugenics"" movement as well as anything I have seen or read.  These elite look for a world where 80% of the current world's population has been killed off through various means.

Like many of you, I used to think such things were impossible.  But in my first career as a biologist, I would more and more often hear giants in the field of science say things like ""Thank God for malaria in the third world!""  I would be shocked at such racist, idiotic, genocidal talk and would look around at the circle of listeners nodding in agreement.  These people really do believe that diseases killing millions of people are a good thing.  I watch as diverse fields like business, government, education, and medicine all seem to converge to the same one-world socialist solutions.  I watch idiotic ideas like socialized medicine, global warming being caused by man-made CO2, and illegal immigration crammed down our throats even though upwards of 90% of the citizens oppose these ideas.  And the only explanation is to believe the organized criminals who head up education, industry and the government really do mean what they say.

So watch this and wake up.  I also recommend several other doumentaries by the same film-maker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terrorstorm-2nd-Edition/dp/B000QGE89W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition</a>, on 9-11 and other similar terrorist incidents,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Secrets-and-The-Order-of-Death-Inside-Bohemian-Grove/dp/B000RWCAAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Secrets and The Order of Death: Inside Bohemian Grove</a>, a scary examination of a 100 year old retreat where Presidents, and World rulers meet and perform a mock human sacrifice to Moloch (yes, that Moloch - the one in the old testament that pagans used to sacrifice their children to).  You won't believe it until you see it.

Negatives of the film are parts are repetitious.  The Bilderberger meetings part didn't say exactly what was going on at the meeting, it only showed these people showing up to this meeting.  I think more evidence of the links between these groups and current governmental policy would make the case better.

See rich people stare sardonically at cameras outside an Ottawa hotel as Jones and other freedom-fighting photographers, journalists, and wackjobs take pictures through tinted limo windows on the sidewalk outside and scream, ""We're not your slaves!"" Jones himself is stopped and DELAYED at the Ottawa airport by the Powers-That-Be who only release him when a crack team of Internet journalists show up. Power of the Press!

If there IS a global conspiracy and Jones and his friends have stumbled on it, do you really think their DVDs would be appearing on Amazon.com? The United States government, a single political entity, snatches people from their homes all over the world and secretes them in secret in prisons in many countries not to be heard from for months or years later. Don't you think the most powerful men and women in the world, bent on global domination--and not just greed and egotism, as really motivates bad people--would tolerate such canaries calling out in the coalmine?

This is fun, fun, fun. Just don't expect to take it seriously. If you do, I recommend you tackle some history from historians, not these crackpots. History teaches us that people come up with terrible ideas that fail and kill millions of people. Wars gets started over frivolous things. Men and women profit from those wars. The truth in history is that humans are cruel, sometimes evil, and should be punished and rooted out. Unfortunately, the REAL job of digging into the REAL power structures of governments, militaries, and corporations must be left to journalists and freethinkers who don't waste their time on Art Bell shows and Endgame.

Still, I recommend you see this! It's a blast!",1195603200,3,2337,5.038860103626943

The elites will then use powerful technologies (currently available but held in top secrecy) to essentially live forever. Sounds crazy, like a science fiction novel right?
One would have to think that the claims and allegations contained within this documentary are outlandish and crazy. I mean, this is all just made up, right? As a naturally born skeptic who is taught to think critically, I always research and cross reference any stated claim against criteria to the contrary. Also, checking a claims' factual content for opinionated bias is a very important warning flag to look for. Often facts are skewed in documentaries to create an opinionated context to apply those said facts. It is concurrently important to see what the ""other side"" is saying in rebuttal.
 I can tell you honestly that this film is well documented and sourced. There is a lot of hard, honest evidence to support the claims in this film. There is also little information to oppose that programs of eugenics and genocide are in full effect now and have throughout history.  There are few claims out there that can actually refute the data that Alex Jones presents. In fact, Alex seems to whitewash the severety of these claims with conservative numbers! He also does not seem to present the information in biased contexts, but presents the material for you to see how anyone would come to these conclusions.
 If you actually do the research, and follow the history, you will find that things are worse that Mr. Jones presents!
 The worst part of it all is that you are not going to get much information about these secret elites meetings, because they are SECRET!!! The fact that many powerful and influential government and corporate leaders are meeting in heavily guarded secrecy to talk about ""us common people"" should worry everyone.
I believe that this is a substantial documentary that is well done, both in content and production. To be truly informed about how the world really goes around, although scary as it may be, you must see this film. It may be one of the most important films of our time. I also urge you not listen to me, however think for yourself. Do the research and you will find that the rabbit hole is deeper than you could imagine.",1195430400,2,2385,4.8669950738916254

At the time, I thought there might be something to his allegations of corruption in high places, but I thought he was way over the top - I thought he was a bit crazy. That was five years ago. After following up on his claims, I have found that there is far too much that he says that is true. I wish to God it weren't true, but all his stuff checks out. As Alex himself often says, ""Don't believe a word I say, check it out for yourself.""

This video is largely meant as an introduction for anyone who has never even heard of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, or any of the many other New World Order management groups that play God and make decisions on who lives and who dies in the next few years.

I also found his bullhorning of people to be verging on the too repetitive for effectiveness. Furthermore, it does strike me as odd that such a secretive, and allegedly dastardly and evil bunch, as the Bilderberg group, choose to meet in such publicly available places. After all, with so few of them per meeting, it would make much more sense to hold their meetings in a private and obscure location, of which many must exist. There's all those abandoned nuclear bunkers, for instance, going for little more than a million dollars apiece. They'd save that on the security detail, for a start.

As for the eugenics section, one can be sanguine to the extent that, barring a great leap forward in genetic engineering, the elite will be outdone by nature, in their ambition to interbreed 'der &uuml;bermenchen.'

In conclusion, when distrust and unaccountability is running at the pitch presented in Endgame and its counterparts, it would be fair to say that a serious step-change is needed in order to restore trust and believability in the administration, whatever the truth may be.",1194998400,,1245,4.895734597156398

Stating that the Bilderbegers are toiling towards a one world government is not proof that they are working for a one world government.

I'm not saying that it's not okay to have fun and be entertained, but, c'mon--let's be balanced here.  Like Alex Jones said on a recent interview on prisonplanet tv, ""I'm not saying that you can't go to baseball games.  Go ahead and go to a baseball game.  Just be balanced.""  Then he went on to emphasize how important it is to stay awake to the world around you, and after watching Endgame, you will see why.
  Alex Jones creates yet another brilliant expose surrounding the masterminds behind the ""New World Order"" known as the Bilderberg Group.  If you start doing a little research, my friends, you will find out that this is no longer a bunch of psycho babble issuing forth from so-called ""conspiracy nuts"", but must be seen as it truly is-- a very terrifying attempt at a fourth reich intent on enslaving the planet.  Hats off to Alex Jones for the wake-up call and hopefully more people will see this documentary and take it seriously.

One possible way to make the average person to wake up to this is perhaps the next front cover of the latest ""Betty and Veronica"" magazine feature something about the Bilderbergs and have it go something like this:

Betty:  Veronica! I just finished watching ""Endgame"" by Alex Jones about The Bilderbergs using a New World Order to enslave the planet!

Veronica: Hmm.  ""Bilderberg"".  You mean its all about how you can ""Build  Your Own Burger?!?!?""",1194998400,7,1789,4.613924050632911

Jones investigates and exposes the plans of the secretive Bilderberg group and the core group of elites that control it.

All claims are backed by well documented research, although a bibliography insert in the DVD case would be a very nice touch.  Nevertheless, inquisitive people can validate Jones' claims with a modicum of investigation.  Overall, an extremely well synthesized and researched film.

History, people, news articles, you name it.  Alex and his team have read over a dozen books to get this information together - some books, no doubt, written by the Bilderbergs themselves.  They have done the research, they KNOW what's going on in today's world, and now with Endgame, so can you.

Of course, there are always those who would rather push the information aside as nonsense without actually LOOKING at the information.  This is changing. Everything Alex has said since 9/11 is really starting to manifest and pick up in pace and people are starting to snap out of LaLa land thanks to Alex and his supporters.

I have watched Endgame on google video, which Alex Jones doesn't mind, he also says we can copy the DVDs and burn them onto disk and hand them out to people, which is exactly why I just ordered the Endgame DVD from Amazon (and I want to see this in high quality sexyness).

This is the information you need, to heke with the other documentaries, this is the most important video you could ever watch in your lifetime.  Do I recommend it?  Yes.

Colleagues of mine have taken issue with the credibility of the Police State series, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and the like. The facts were all there, but people in Western culture tend to be more receptive to style over substance. Last year, Terrorstorm crossed the threshold into the realm of mainstream documentary cinematography. This year, Endgame plants the flag in the soil.

...and rightfully so, for it is Jones' most important film to date, dealing with the gravest threat to free humanity on planet Earth. Again, the facts are all documented, but when wed to excellent editing, a dark and powerful score, and a fluid, logical presentation of concepts and information (another area upon which Jones has vastly improved) Endgame is indeed a sharp blow to skull, both shocking the unacquainted viewer from sleep, and smashing the mask off of the New World Order itself.

The information in this film will not only motivate people to save our country, but it will also motivate people to speak out against the genocides that have been happening in our world for centuries at the hands of these evil international elite.  At the very least, people will have the information necessary to do whatever they can to save themselves and their families.

Although most uninformed people simply do not believe what I tell them about what is happening in this world, this film will not elicit the same reaction because Alex has backed up everything in his film with THEIR OWN WORDS.  It is absolutely chilling.

This is exactly what Alex Jones encourages people to do.  Don't believe me?  Listen to his show.  He gets furious with people's ignorance.  He makes these documentaries to try and educate people and return them to a state of rational self-thinking, i.e., cure their zombieism.

I loved the part where he bullhorned the Bilderburgers, and stood up tough against them.  There's not too many who would dare sneer at the global elite, but Alex proves once again his unlove for world tyrants.  Isn't that truly the American thing to do?  To stand up to tyrants?  Any Americans out there remember their forefathers?

I'm also glad Alex finally took some time to expose Darwin and Galton and the entire evolution/eugenics crowd.  He'd been threatening to get that out in a documentary for a long time.  Kudos, Alex.  People need to better understand who Charles Darwin was before they endorse his theories.

There was also some good info on the Trans-Texas Corridor and how the coming wave of illegals is serving a global purpose.  Again I say to also listen to Alex Jones' radio show!  He's very quick to point out that it's not ""mexicans"" that are the problem.  There is a very real global cabal to destroy American sovereignty, and Mexican Nationals are only a fraction of the problem.  These Nationals ARE NOT coming here to become Americans!  They ARE NOT immigrants.  Though there are obviously legitimate Mexicans trying desperately to immigrate legally to America.  May God bless them!

But the Trans-Texas Corridor isn't only about illegal immigration!  Watch the documentary to learn more!  There's also info about the coming North American Union and plans to funnel people into super-cities for easier control

The Georgia Guidestones and many eugenics papers and opinions are so effective that many people buy into the ""there are too many humans"" argument.

A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones by RC Christian in 1979 to give us eugenics propoganda, I mean guidance.  It is inscribed in stone in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Ancient Chinese and Russian. The message in English reads:

Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.
Unite humanity with a living new language.
Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
Balance personal rights with social duties.
Prize truth - beauty - love - seeking harmony with the infinite.
Be not a cancer on the earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature.

A shorter message appears on the four vertical surfaces of the capstone, again in a different language and script on each face. The explanatory tablet near the Guidestones identifies these languages/scripts as Babylonian Cuneiform (north), Classical Greek (east), Sanskrit (south), and Egyptian Hieroglyphs (west), and provides what is presumably an English translation: ""Let these be guidestones to an age of reason.""

That said, I was completely rapt from start to finish.

Terrorstorm is a good primer for Endgame, though each film certainly stands on its own, because the information in each of Alex Jones' films builds upon the foundation of the film before it. Nevertheless, I think that anyone with a discerning mind can follow along just fine and come to his or her own conclusions about the factual truths contained therein.

One caveat: once you've watched this movie, you won't be able to forget it. To borrow an oft used phrase, you can't unlearn what you've learned. This film will change your perception of the world.",1194912000,7,840,4.7465753424657535

Well, this film will wake you up to the reality of it all. Not only the fact that these organisations exist, but that they have some horrific stuff planned for us all. You might see the war on terror and the cult of carbon footprint / man made global warming mythology in a different light after watching this. This film is possibly more frightening for the people who don't have a clue about any of this stuff, but maybes not so for the ones who already have some considerable knowledge in the area.",1194912000,3,841,4.432258064516129

The presentation seems radical only because we have been pacified by those who would benefit from a one world government and from depopulation measures by way of  an ""infotainment"" mass media culture that has been in place for many years .

2950054,5,B000VSDNHS,"I've been a fan of Alex Jones' work for a long time. His films have gotten better over the years, and Endgame is certainly the best so far. The information about the Bilderberg group wasn't anything new to me, but the back story and history of the eugenics societies was all new and quite a revelation.

The problem is, the narrative conclusion of Endgame is going to be hard for Alex to beat. The facts and issues raised in Endgame: depopulation, controlled societies, forced evolution of man through the power of genetics, these issues are certainly at the core of our entire corrupted system, and these issues should be addressed right now among all people of the Earth. Are we to evolve as a free dynamic race, or are we going to let a small group of bankers and elitists steer society in a direction of their choosing? Endgame provides a lot of questions, and even the answers provide only more questions. But how is this to be topped? What more needs to be said or proven about our ruling elite to show them for the evil, sadistic men they are?

Unless undeniable proof that our ruling class is made up of aliens from another planet, I fail to see anything coming close to the facts brought to the surface by Alex Jones in Endgame. This film is a documentary, but it's also a horror film. It just doesn't get any scarier than this.",1194912000,189,1337,4.475409836065574
3183627,5,B000VSDNHS,"Engdgame is by far Alex Jones most powerful documentary. I am quite familiar with Alex Jones and much of the information divulged in the film. His last documentary, TerrorStorm, was an expose of government sponsored terrorism, including 9/11, 7/7, OKC and historical events used to instigate wars.

This film really delves much deeper into what the elite are trying to accomplish. If this is new to you, you will definitely want to check out his previous films, as well as Aaron Russo's America: Freedom to Fascism.

Though I enjoyed (I guess that is not really the right word; how could you enjoy hearing this stuff?) the entire film, I was especially blown away by the latter part of the documentary which covers the eugenics programs taking place in America and the connection of America to Nazi's. Again, for me, this is not new information. But I have never seen it presented so clearly with such substantial evidence.

This film is a must see for the section about eugenics alone. Did you know that tens of thousands of american girls have been sterilized against their will by the United States government? If not, see this film immediately!

It's time to wake up. Or soon we'll be out of time.",1194566400,5,1201,4.759615384615385
3183628,3,B000VSDNHS,"I won't waste your time, so I'll just get to why I gave this movie 3 stars and why I would suggest purchasing the must see ""Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition"" instead.

The first half of the movie is boring, too much activism/street action and not enough facts period. By facts I mean: information, documents, clips, sound bites, interviews, quotes, news clippings, etc. If this is your first time learning about the NWO or if you are showing this film to someone that is not awake, not only are they going to be bored - they are also going to be confused because they won't know why Alex is bull-horning cars, watching people, etc. To the people I showed this film too that weren't awake, the first half of the film was to them basically a fat guy (Alex) harassing people and doing stuff.

The other problems with the first half is that they will name people on screen that they spot at Bilderburg while doing surveillance, but won't tell you why these people are important. They'll just give a name and that's it. In some ways this made me feel as if Endgame was too rushed, a topic I'll get back to on later. And if Bilderburg is so powerful why not tell the viewers, especially the unawakened ones, about some of things they have discussed in past meetings that have come to pass? For example we could have mentioned how the Bilderburgers talked about the housing crisis that the US is having now, but instead we give no examples of how powerful this group is and how they shape the world. Finally the last problem with the first half of the film is that it's too much like an inside conversation. In other words, if you were in a conversation with 2 other people where person A and person B were talking about a topic they both knew well but you know nothing about, you'd feel quite lost and or bored. That's how the first section of Endgame feels to someone new to this NWO subject. Watching a bunch of guys congratulating each other on confronting Bilderburgers and bull-horning them and doing surveillance means nothing.

Now, if you can make it through the first half of the film the second, and superior half, of the movie will not disappoint. This is where the movie picks up speed and draws you into the world of the NWO, NAU(North American Union), and Eugenics. Whether your awake or not the second half will teach as well as entertain and shock you. If the second half was a movie by itself, it would easily get a 5/5. But due to the first half of the movie, it drops the score to its deserved 3/5 score.

Now I mentioned before that the movie seems a bit too rushed. I say this because of the first half of the movie, where they would name people and act as if they are important but won't tell you why or what they do, not giving examples of how powerful Bilderburg is,  as well as for the ending of the extra included on the DVD called ""The Battle For The Republic."" ""The Battle of The Republic"" ends too abruptly, as if there was more to say but it then got cut off. These problems also contributed to the 3/5 score I gave to this film.

In the end, Endgame is not a movie I would recommend to someone or show to someone that is unawake. If I were to show/recommend a movie to someone who is unawake it would be ""Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition"" because it is an excellent film period as well as the best film you can get on state sponsored terrorism, it is paced better, doesn't needlessly show activism like other Alex Jones films do, and just hits you with facts so that you know what is going on and not left outside of the loop if you are unawake, or bore you if you are awake. If you must show ""Endgame"" it should be shown to those that are awake, or to those that are unawake but have watched ""Terrorstorm: Special Edition.""",1194048000,59,3733,4.35632183908046
3183629,5,B000VSDNHS,"I would have to say that this is the best work that Alex Jones has done yet. You get the sense that he is maturing as a film maker, as he is able to stay focused and present the history on this subject in a calm direct way. In his older film's at times he would go off in many directions, even though his infomation was good, at times he would be very hard for me to follow, which would cause me lose interest. Not so with his last two film's.

With ""End Game"" and ""Terrorstorm"" before it Alex keeps the focus and presents calmly through is stern dictation the history of our global elete.

I hope that people who view this follow up and do their own research as I have, the in formation in the film is factual and can be verified. The United States citizens must face the fact that what has already happened elsewhere throughout history is going to happen here. We have no choice but to get people educated and to have them stand up for the rights that the foudning fathers gave their lives for!",1194048000,15,996,4.209424083769633

If you don't believe in conspiracies and conspirators, you must watch this movie and see what the theorists have been talking about all along. A picture really is worth a thousand words.

While Alex Jones often gets in the way of his own message, the movie is still worth seeing and easier than reading the many books previously written about this topic.",1193443200,13,649,4.794642857142857

All fine and dandy if the highly uneducated masses didn't believe this tripe. The problem, however, is they do, and Jones plays them all like fiddles. As for the documentary itself, it's extremely disjointed and the assertions are poorly defended and ultimately irrelevant. Here is just one example: according to Jones, WWI was started in order to create the League of Nations with the expressed goal to create a single, global government. In reality, the League of Nations was proposed by Wilson only after the war started, and the US didn't even join it.

Thanks to liberty revival masters like Alex Jones, I learned a great deal of information that only further backed up and confirmed what I already knew about shadow government was far worse than I thought and ahead of schedule. Thanks to the efforts of the film makers and my desire to disprove the conspiracy theorists, I found various historians, politicians, military, retired intelligence operatives, film makers, and patriots all dedicated to exposing a sinister conspiracy to control, manipulate and enslave all mankind gradually and covertly so we would not even know it was happening. Most of these Alex Jones produced documentaries I have watched tie in very well with testimony from former FBI director Ted Gunderson, the Kay Griggs interview with FBI,  William Copper, Jullian Assange and Edward Snowden's massive information leaks..

I am not impressed with their credentials. There will be a one world government headed by the antichrist.  If you want to avoid it, ask Jesus to save you and come and get us.  He promised to.  He promised Israel over and over to bring them back from all over the world to an Israel which He would make a nation in one day.  Ezekial even told the exact day, May 14, 1948.  (you can look up Ezekial May 14, 1948 on google and see)  He also promised the church to come and get us.  I suggest  1 Thessalonians  4.13... and 2 Thess. 2.9-12.  John 3.16  It is a choice to believe in Jesus.  If you don't want to give up your life or your sin, tell Jesus.  He will certainly and lovingly help you.
Isaiah 46.9-10.  God says He tells the end from the beginning so we will know the Bible is His Word.  Deuteronomy 18.18-22.  He says that if any of a prophet's words don't come true, God didn't speak to him.  God expects us to know He is God because all the promises (hundreds) He has given that have happened came true to the letter.  A great big bunch are now coming true.

There may well be some kind of New World Order, but these Alex Jones nuts
have no idea what they are for or against or what the people they fight are even
representing.

We were on the way to a New World Order with Franklin Roosevelt, with the
New Deal, and the 4 Freedoms ... something that Jones alludes to in the opening
of this dork-u-mentary when he shows the film of Maj. General Smedley D. Butler
talking about the attempt at the time to overtly take over the US government.

That attempt failed, but did we go the way of FDR or did something else happen.
This, in the very first minutes of the neurotic dork-u-mentary is where the
coherence derails and it rockets in to hyperbolic foolishness ... meanwhile the
little snippets trying to paint Alex Jones as a true patriot are not lost.

This is Alex Jones trying to make himself leader or some kind of nut group,
like Glen Beck, or Rush Limbaugh, or Sean Hannity, etc.  These extremist
ignoramuses could well be the reason we will need a New World Order to
protect us from the foolish people who buy into their simple-minded fairy tales.

Anyway, not horrible, kind of entertaining in a funny way, and God help us if
there are groups of people out there who believe this stuff.  I think there are just
a lot of confused people who not longer get any news, journalism, civics, and
are lied to so much on TV and on the Radio they don't know what to believe,
and this nonsense somehow appeals to them.",1477353600,2,1485,4.4375

However I sometimes think he spouts a little too much non sense and that is why alot of the non believers think he is nuts. Like his famous, ""the answer to 1984 is 1776"", is completely ridiculous. The idiots who fought for freedom against the British and started the new country with declarations and laws were just as much hypocrites as their enemies. Rich Slave Owners telling the citizens of a new nation that all men are created equal. Except for anyone who wasn't white or any women or homosexuals. This country was founded on utter smelling B.S. and that is why it has fallen apart now. As for Alex screaming at these Bilderberg morons about them being taken down or arrested and things of that nature. The people in power will never be taken down unless the group lets it happen to certain ones they want to get rid of or replace. I hate to say it, but we are never going to win this because it is already over.

I put the word ""documentary"" in quotation marks because I can't even really say that this qualifies as a documentary.  Jones does a nice job putting the show together, but he fails to ever produce even one shread of evidence that could be called concrete or factual.  He shouts claims of conspiracies involving the ""elite,"" but fails to identify who they are, or elaborate on how they plan on wiping out over 80% of the world's population?  Jones provides experts with credentials that are sketchy, at best, if not down right ludacris.  And that is assuming that he even names his experts.

3184082,4,B000VSDNHS,"Alex Jones has been accused of all kinds of things... someday he will end up dead, just like the rest of the people that put their life on the line to tell the truth... disseminate lies, disinformation, and fight against corruption in government, and the people who don't have our interest in mind AT ALL but only do the bidding of the rich like puppets, who want more control, more control, more control. They already have all the resources horded in the world, so what left but a 1984 blueprint for ultimate control. We all have to open our mind to at least the possibility - simply compare how monitored we are now by technology to 30 years ago. Its common sense to come to the conclusion that people in power are going to use that to their advantage. And the government sector is decades beyond the public sector in technology.

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe everything Jones says, but I do know that what is conspiracy theory one day 10-30 years from then becomes common knowledge. Like I said, Jones has been accused of all kinds of things: a conspiracy theory hack, crazy, a fear monger (there are more fear mongers in government than the people trying to reveal these kind of secrets, let me tell you - remember the ridiculous color coded homeland security advisory system?), as well as being called an anti-Semite. He is none of these things. The last charge comes from ill-educated P.C. morons who are so quick to jump on the defense of anyone if political correctness line is passed or they think it is. Jones is not racist, he is an anti-Zionist, and an anti-Federalist and anti-Ruling Class system. Jewish dynasties happen to comprise some of this system that Jones is against. So if being anti federalist or anti Zionist makes you an anti-Semite, I guess I am too, even though that is ludicrous.

We all have to be open to these ideas, as far fetched as they seem, because, like I said, conspiracy theories often become common knowledge... dissemminated secrets, 5, 10 or 20 years later.

This film deserves a watch by just about everyone interested in the future of mankind and which way it could go, which should be all of us. So are the zeitgeist films, all three... I don't buy all of the religious claims and sometimes atheist themes in Zeitgeist, though I am certain that religion has been used throughout time by governments/ruling class to control people, but you don't have to ascribe to all of that to take what is the true from these movies, mostly the dissemination of lies. This film and the three Zeitgeists (which can be watched for free streamed online from their website) are a great compendium for anyone interested in ""conspiracy theory,"" new world order theories and what the richest of the rich are up to (and I don't mean Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey, but the Rockerfellers, the Vanderbelts, the Rothschilds, the JP Morgans, the Billderberg group, the organizations that run the world that are run by these people, such as the world bank, the WTO (World Trade Organizations), NAFTA, NATO, etc, and the hidden networks used between them (that have been historically known as the illuminati, the free masons, etc.)

Its reasonable to have what some would consider a ""balanced"" opinion of Jones and this film - ""take it for what it is"" ""there's truth in it, but there's not a global conspiracy"" - but to the folks that give the film one star and call him a nut job, they've been fed the lies, ate them and been poisoned by them i.e. conditioned, and not open to question anything, and don't realize that we need people like Alex Jones to dig up hidden truths - people that think their governments tell them everything, or the things they don't tell them are simple matters of security, and that there aren't people out there with agendas that are bad for mankind, they are the most naive people on the planet. EVERYTHING'S OKAY! How gullible can a person be. There's also a damn good reason this film has four and a half stars average with hundreds of reviews. There's an old saying... READ A BOOK! And not just your business books that tell you how to climb the company ladder and be the best cog you can be.

Give this film a chance, because MANY of your republicans aren't republicans anymore, they are neo-cons who don't stand for the old GOP values such as small government or our second amendment rights, but rather Federalists who want to control the population through big government, and many of the democrats aren't who they once were either - people for social freedoms and social assistance, but they're virtually the same thing as the Republicans: Federalists who only have the interest of the rich (who funded their elections) in mind and therefore do their bidding. Just look at the current and last failure... This movie sheds light on why things are the way they are, and the middle class is disappearing... More calculating goes on behind closed doors than any of us would ever want to know, but if we become educated, we might be able to change what is destroying our country and the world. Final words, watch this movie, as well as the zeitgeists!!!",1337990400,5,5108,4.658536585365853
3184083,2,B000VSDNHS,"I'll be brief and try not to repeat points that others have made. As far as I can see, conservatives, are not good at promoting conspiracy theories - I say that he must be a Republican because he holds those conservative sacred principles: protectionism: we white Europeans conquered the United States a few hundred years ago, therefore we own it: the need to keep foreigners out: the Bilderbergers want to take our guns away: God is on our side: we should be able to do what ever we want: we shouldn't have to pay taxes: among others. These to me are not admirable principles.

 Alex Jones, doesn't seem able to separate the ""wheat from the chaff"". He mixes truth with with fiction, takes many things out of context less skillfully than Michael Moore and often ""throws the baby out with the bathwater"", like when he lumps together those that have committed holocausts and eugenics experiments with those that promote responsible birth control such as ""Planed Parenthood"", branding them all evil.

 His theories lack any evidence and he posses no alternatives. I suppose he is a textbook anarchist with a heightened sense of self-importance.

 I give it an extra star for the interesting archival footage. The film was fairly entertaining, but the lack of a consistent message resulted in me not being able to take it seriously. I am baffled at so many five star ratings. So many people seem to mix up emotions with reason. America is filled with much pain and fear.

3184086,1,B000VSDNHS,"Seems like everyone pretty much just eats this up, like there really is global threat of an evil finacial empire capable of enslaving the enire population ultimately.  This is the ultimate conspiracy theory to end all of em I guess. It would almost be comical if it were no so sad that overwhelmingly we have just missed the whole thing! Our problem is never about what evil people can do, I mean make no mistake, I am not denying the fact that there really ARE people that think in these grand terms, because of course there are.  HOWEVER the entity that we really ought to focus on is God and NOT man!  It is entirely, completly at God's whim to at any moment remove various people from power and install whom He wills to! God is our problem, not our fellow human beings with grandiose ideas! The Bible is telling us this in passages like Daniel 2:21  ""...He removeth kings, and setteth up kings...blessed be the name of God for ever and ever...""

  In fact when we carry on like folks do in the film, focusing all on man's power to threaten people and man's power to overcome those who enslave their fellow man without acknowleding the complete and sovereign right and ability that God alone posses to allow, prohibit, or flat out cause whatever is to be then we are denying that God is GOD!  Human being's can do NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING unless God willfully allows it!  It is just pride in our pathetic ability to believe otherwise!  It is the same pride at work in fearing our evil fellow man as it is to think we could defeat some evil government if they grabbed power.  After reading and studying the Bible for years I continually convinced that all of our problems, all of our woes in everything from rust to cancer, to the tyranny of evil rulers, ALL of these things are heaped upon us for our sin!  We SHOULD all respond to it by falling on our faces in the dirt, in tears of repentence begging Almighty God for mercy we in no way deserve!  THAT is how each and every one us SHOULD respond to our plight!  Do we?  Look around.  We not only don't humble ourselves trembling, no we just heap sin upon sin, we just keep pushing God out of the equations, either that or we ignore (or outright deny) the authority of the Bible and re-create God in a way that pleases our sensibilities.  Many see man as basically good and God just loving them no matter what and they ascribe all the bad things to an ultra powerful evil force the Devil who creates all the disease and creates all of our dreadful plagues and problems...this is a weak god that loves us and really wants to help but can only do so if we do our part too. This is that same sinful wicked pride just dressed up to look holy, and so are myraids of various concoctions of of man's evil imagination to work out in all the other ways we can dream up too.  But nothing changes the truth. We can't hide from the truth long either for death is right there on the horizon for each of us.  Balk if you want, slander and ridicule me for saying these things if it makes you feel justified too.  And then just watch your life ebb away into disease and death.  Watch as the work of your hands is spoiled or given to another. Just take your pride kicking and screaming into the judgment of destruction that sits upon  mankind since the garden. The truth is we come right from the womb speaking lies in our heart.  The only thing that could save any of us is an outright miracle.  The word ""grace"" that is flouted all over the place means ""unmerited favor"" God's grace in the miracle of salvation is to take some people, who are in no wise better than anyone else and against their evil nature, in spite of the fact that they would never truly repent and come to God begging for mercy confessing they had nothing to commend themselves, that He would take these people one by one out from among the nations in which they are dispersed and miraculously take away their dead stony heart and give them a new and living heart to want truth. THAT is grace! That is the miracle that is of the Lord Jesus Christ, God rooted into the seed of man, the fullness of the eternal Godhead manifest into the heart of a human being provided by God as the only just sacrifice to make the saving of some of us possible.  I can say these words, but I do not really understand how it is possible!  I do not at all claim to know how in the world Jesus could have been fully eternal God yet stripped of everything and actually existing as a human being exactly like all of us in every way, tested in every way as we are yet totally maintaining perfect righteousness. Personally I do not see how Jesus could even have known who He really was, but would have to have learned each thing according to God's grace. How is that possible that the eternal infiniite Creator of EVERYTHING would be stripped of everything but His soul, AS A HUMAN BEING in a body of death?  I have not the slighest hint of an idea how it could be but He was what He was and is what He IS!  Put off these pridefull fears of man and fear God!  Read the Bible and BEG for His mercy! For all you know, if you can even do this, perhaps you too are being drawn by the Father to Christ?  I think there is the real probability that Oct 21 of THIS year is the final judgement of this world! It makes abundant sense to me anyway!",1308960000,2,5325,4.274900398406374

3184178,5,B000VSDNHS,"_Endgame:  Blueprint for Global Enslavement_ (2007) by film maker Alex Jones is a decent film showing the history of the Bilderbergers, the secret yearly meetings of the world's elite.  I agree with Jones that the Bilderbergers are definitely up to no good.  As Jim Tucker, a reporter who has spent years following them, says in the film, ""They are plotting in secrecy because they are plotting evil.  Good works are done in the sunshine.""  Jones also does a good job of showing how the elite plan to use eugenics to decimate the world's population.  Concerns about overpopulation and environmentalism are cynically exploited by the world's ultra-rich elite to justify eugenics and murder.  Jones shows us how both presidents Bush and Clinton have been in on this scheme and have sought to achieve a ""new world order"".  My main and only criticism of this film is Jones' style.  Because Jones is so confrontational and does completely idiotic things like harassing people on street corners or stalking celebrities, he ends up coming off more as an unhinged nut than a serious individual and ends up just making a public menace of himself.  Also some of the claims in this film may be exaggerated, although I agree with its general message.",1233273600,,1238,4.908653846153846

Endgame is like another bookend, holding together the fear and lies that engulf this country.

I've heard of the New World Order and always thought of it similar to the Nazi-ruling of the 40's across Europe; their unrelenting, unsatiable lust for power that has no limits, and can only stop once it's been overtaken/overthrown. And what usually happens in that case is just a cycle of greed; people starting out with good intentions but eventually become corrupt by the very system by which they've escaped from. Endgame takes us through various points in history at the development of this NWO and spends a good amount of time detailing the Bilderberg Group and it's role in global enslavement.

There is an enormous amount of information to take in, but when you look at it in comparision to the events that are happening today, you can see it all making sense.

This is about the Bilderberg Group and their plan for global domination. I understand corporatocracy and NAFTA, but how much deeper does this go? I've heard of the FEMA prisons, the North American Union (US, Canada, Mexico all one nation), and the trans-Texas corridor, and I sense that national sovereignties are dissolving into a class war of elite billionaires versus the populace, but I thought the elites were just powerful and greedy, not a self-proclaimed superior race. (Think eugenics & Nazism.) This does explain their Calvinistic beliefs of being favored by God and more deserving than other people.

I'm shocked to hear that the U.N. and E.U. are part of the master plan. I begin to doubt when he talks about the fomenting of illegal immigration and 'Reconquista' (Mexico's reconquering of California) as a means to weaken US democracy. Call me wicked, but I AGREE with the need for birth control and that it's immoral for a couple to purposely have more than two children. Supplying birth control to poor countries is a GOOD thing for everyone, and his criticism of Planned Parenthood raises my suspicions of him.

Finally, he loses me all together when he says that global warming is due only to the sun having gotten hotter and that they concocted it to support carbon taxes to fund their conquest. Also, I just can't buy that the Sierra Club is part of their devious plan to de-populate and re-wilderness the U.S.

3184207,5,B000VSDNHS,"It's still amazing to me that we can live in the most information rich generation in the history of the world, and so many people can remain ignorant of the truth. The fact that a ""New World Order"" has been aggressively in the works for the past century is not that difficult to discover - many of those involved have stated their goals openly and clearly. The famed scientist Albert Einstein once stated; ""Mankind's desire for peace can be realized only by the creation of a world government ... with all my heart I believe that the world's present system of sovereign nations can only lead to barbarism, war, and inhumanity, and that only law can assure progress toward a civilized peaceful humanity.""  Winston Churchill was once quoted as saying; ""The creation of an authoritative world order is the ultimate aim toward which we must strive.""  These kind of quotes by noted influential leaders are not hard to find. The thing that makes this somehow ""hard to believe"" for many is ""why"" this stuff doesn't get reported on the nightly news. But the answer is obvious; those orchestrating the move towards world government do not want this to be public knowledge. The transition from national sovereignty to global governance is accomplished much easier through subtlety rather than blatancy.  However, rather than admit that a (dare I say) ""conspiracy"" [gasp!] is afoot, many willingly choose to be ignorant of the facts. Fortunately, thanks to people like Alex Jones, Americans (and others who love their country) don't have to rely on CNN for the REAL NEWS. No, believe it or not, the real news is not trivial garbage like how much Brittany Spear's chew gum sold for on Ebay. The REAL NEWS is ""why"" the US government absolutely refuses to do anything about the mass influx of ILLEGAL aliens into America. The REAL NEWS is ""why"" a massive tri-national highway is being built right through the heart of America and nobody's saying anything about it (except our beloved fellow Americans in Texas).  If you want answers to all the news-media blackouts, then get a copy of Alex Jones' ENDGAME. You may not like what you wake-up to, but at least your eyes will be opened. A+ Highly Recommended!

I also wanted to offer a couple of criticisms of the ""Endgame.""  Despite how it is framed by this film, Planned Parenthood is doing a lot of good in the world, providing sex education and a range of health screenings&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacred-Work-Planned-Parenthood-And-Its-Clergy-Alliances/dp/0813539501/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacred Work: Planned Parenthood And Its Clergy Alliances</a>.  Watching this film, one would think Planned Parenthood is out to impose an evil eugenics plan - a bit over the top to anyone with the vaguest familiarity with the organization.
""Endgame"" also portrays the ""rewilding"" of the U.S. as necessarily a terrible thing.  I agree that it's a shame that we've been losing so many farmers and rural communities, largely due to the consolidating machinations of agribusiness&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Future-of-Food/dp/B000V5IOWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Future of Food</a>; but there is a sort of rewilding that this country would benefit from.  Ecologist and former editor of ""Earth First!"" Dave Foreman has written an interesting book on how rewilding the country could restore countless habitats and animals, and enrich the lives of humans&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rewilding-North-America-A-Vision-For-Conservation-In-The-21St-Century/dp/1559630612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rewilding North America: A Vision For Conservation In The 21St Century</a>.  This film tries to frame ""biodiversity"" as something sinister, when it's actually something we and non-human species need to thrive.  See any of the excellent presentations by Vandana Shiva on YouTube or her many books like ""Biopiracy.""  Shiva is always challenging the lawyers and lobbyists who serve corporations like Monsanto and Dow, and she understands what a threat they are to biodiversity.  The corporate world order seeks monoculture and conformity, not the biodiversity that we need to protect and/or restore.
There is a pattern in this film to portray things in the most menacing way possible.  It's kind of manipulative.  One other example of this is the portrayal of the United Nations, complete with the skull imposed on the UN building on the cover of the DVD.  Despite the skull and the spooky coloring, there are actually some people doing good work within the United Nations, particularly in the General Assembly which is often challenging the schemes of the rich and violent nations of the ""security"" council.  There is no fiercer critic of the UN than Phyllis Bennis, but she recognizes the efforts and the opportunities that exist within that flawed institution&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Challenging-Empire-How-People-Governments-and-the-UN-Defy-US-Power/dp/156656607X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Challenging Empire: How People, Governments, and the UN Defy US Power</a>.
My last criticism is actually a note of optimism.  That is, there are many ways to challenge the elite, or to somehow contribute to a better world.  The Global South, which suffers the most from the plans of the corporate aristocracy, has a lot to teach us about the struggle for freedom.  Resistance is flourishing in the form of figures like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hugo-Chavez-The-Bolivarian-Revolution-in-Venezuela/dp/1844675335/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hugo Chavez: The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela</a>, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Fernando Lugo in Paraguay. Meanwhile, movements like the Landless Workers Movement and the participatory democracy in cities like Porto Alegre, Brazil are powerful illustrations that the world's people aren't as pacified as they sometimes appear.

This opened my eyes to many ""truths"" around me that had gone unreported (censored).  During my second viewing of the DVD I had pen and paper and jotted down stated ""facts"" to research and possibly discredit.  Just the opposite occurred, it validated the facts that Alex Jones stated.  It also made me realize the degree of cenorship in the main street press and TV media.  The Bilderberg group in 1954 had extracted a promise from the press to not report about them....outrageous!  The most powerful group of people on planet earth meets with our elected and appointed officals in secret, and we have no knowledge of it!

This documentary by it self didn't turn me full circle but it was a crucial piece in the puzzle. If you are a skeptic please give this DVD a chance...

  Alex Jone's ""Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement"" is not a good first encounter to this information. His passion for informing the people I applaud, but some of his over the top megaphone usage will probably turn off most new comers to this subject matter. For a good over view of The Bilderberg group and the up coming one world government I would suggest Aaron Russo's ""America: Freedom To Fascism"", and read The Naked Capitalist by W. Cleon Skoussen.

  Having said that ""Endgame"" is top notch in it's production, content, and ability to scare the daylights out of you. What you will find as you watch this is a short history of totalitarianism, socialism, feudalism, and the blueprint for the mind set for a ruthless dictator. Alex Jones then ties all of it together into our time with a group of Global Elites who are at this very moment setting up the foundation of The New World Order... National microchiped I.D. cards within a couple of years so they can track you everywhere you go. Discussions of implantable microchips in all society... However, what really caught my attention is the eugenics (selective breeding, sterilazation, and population control methods) programs. The end of America as we know it as it gets absorbed into the North American Union. A lot of this stuff has even been covered briefly by the news media... My short review can't do this documentary justice. I just don't happen to think it's the best one if this is your first look at this material. Buy it, and watch it after you look at a couple others...

I would also suggest G. Edward Griffins, ""The Creature From Jeckyll Islan""",1214006400,6,1995,4.699140401146132
3184230,1,B000VSDNHS,"I didn't actually buy or rent this documentary.  A student of mine (high school) suggested that I watch it,  and he loaned it to me.  It is good for a few laughs due more to its over-the-top, apocalyptic tone, but as a serious documentary it doesn't work--and that is being very kind.

One previous reviewer said it best--rather than serious journalism, it comes off more like a horror story best told around a Halloween campfire.  Dark plots, secret societies, wicked schemes spanning generations, peculiar connections between public figures, eerie parallels between past and present. . .all of these abound in this film, and certain doom awaits humanity unless the masses unite to counteract the nefarious goals of said plots, societies, and schemes.  I admit that some of it can be entertaining, but very little of it is serious.

In truth, the entire documentary rests on a smattering of recent politics (you'll see footage of both Bushes, Richard Holbrooke, Henry Kissinger), economics (NAFTA, the EU), and history (abundant footage of past dictators Zedong, Stalin, Hitler).  Using this material, it then tries to spin off a tale of impending world conquest, doom, destruction, slavery, and oppression.  Specifically, the video and its producer, Alex Jones, attempt to convince viewers of the existence of a sinister conspiracy to create a ""New World Order,"" in which a secret cadre of predatory business and political elites (Jones accuses David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger of belonging to the cadre, but--whoops--never offers any proof), operating according to the dictates of some master plan (Jones theatrically calls it a master plan as he conjectures wildly about what it consists of), are at this very moment working to 1) Destroy national boundaries and establish a world government 2) Reduce world population to a manageable level of 500 million 3) Reduce the world's inhabitants to slave laborers or something akin to slave laborers.  I'm obviously over-simplifying things some, but that's the core of the theory.

It's a lunatic theory, and Jones never comes close in this documentary to offering any hard proof of it.  Nor could he have.  The few interviews that he conducts are people who are obviously as paranoid, anxious, and conspiracy-minded as he is and give the viewer no assurance that Jones or anyone close to him have a hold on reality.  Jones then compounds his credibility problem by jumping from one big idea to the next, ending the film with a discussion of past eugenics programs and claiming that China's 1 child per family rule is actually part of the New World Order's master plan to de-populate the world.

Well, anyway. . .I don't understand how a documentary with such a crazed mentality can earn so many 4-star and 5-star reviews.  But on this one, I'll gladly take my place with the minority.",1212883200,37,2838,5.05793991416309

3184255,4,B000VSDNHS,"Alex Jones is far less credible, however, when he attempts to weave all of these facts into a broad ""master plan for world domination."" Many of his conclusions seem to stand cause and effect on their heads, while others seem to reflect a strong personal, and likely religious bias. For example, Jones and his supporters dismiss all of the crises we face in the coming century - fossil fuel depletion, climate change, global warming, declining supplies of food and fresh water world-wide - as nothing but hoaxes concocted by the global elite as the premise for bringing about their plans for world domination, despite the existence massive volumes of evidence that would suggest exactly the opposite. He has a special contempt for environmentalists of any stripe, universally condemning them as a vital part of the global elites' plan. This is ironic, considering that many environmentalists, peak oilers, human rights activists etc. sound the same warnings of economic chaos, rising police states world-wide, and population collapse Jones himself does, howbeit for somewhat different reasons. While I have not read much about Jones' personal religious views, what he says in much of his work is very much in harmony with Christian Fundamentalist groups in my part of the country, which would provide a clear explanation for this.

Jones is also well-known for highly selective use of quotations by well-known figures to support his theories, while ignoring many other things they also said. For example it is completely true that Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and H.G. Wells, (among many others) were staunch supporters of eugenics - in its early days. What wasn't mentioned,however, was that every one of them totally renounced that support as they came to realize the terrible acts and policies eugenics could be used to justify. Aldous Huxley, for example, wrote Brave New World in the 30's as a cautionary tale - a warning of the terrible things that could happen if the theories of eugenics, organic evolution etc were taken to certain logical extremes. Bertrand Russell fiercely denounced Hitler and the Nazi movement from its very beginnings, and his name appeared prominently at the top of a Gestapo list of people to be executed immediately when the Nazis succeeded in taking Britain.

A final, major annoyance in this film is the disproportionate amount of time devoted to Jones ranting on a bullhorn at the Bilderberg delegates in Ottawa. Most of his taunts,such as ""we're not your slaves,"" and ""the answer to 1984 is 1776"" are downright pathetic, and help brand Jones as a 'paranoid whack job.' Small wonder the Bilderbergs and other global elites are content to completely ignore him.

Despite these criticisms, I recommend End Game as a five-star film. Here's why.

If End Game weren't presented as a documentary, I would still recommend it as the best Science Fiction film I had seen in many years. I mean no disrespect when I say this. Science fiction (not the Sci-fi Channel crap, the real thing) in its highest form is better called speculative fiction...it asks the question 'what if...?' and then produces a story that attempts to answer it. Even as fiction End Game is a chilling and provocative story. Science fiction, after all, doesn't describe something that is actually happening, but rather something that theoretically/reasonably could happen.

So, what if?

What if a small group of people actually did want to dominate the world? What if they had learned the lessons of history and understood that no single nation or political entity could ever accomplish it. How would they pull it off?

Suppose this international group, bound not by nationality or ethnic affiliation but rather by a common world-view, realized that the way to world domination lay in taking total control of the world's financial infrastructure - its central banks, stock markets, and lending institutions, rather than by military conquest. And what if, for the first time in human history, the technology existed to actually carry out their plans...to shape public opinion, to form corporations richer and more influential than most of the world's governments, and to control the policies of the rest through foreign aid, trade and debt? What if...?

What if...?

...despite the limitations and blatant silliness in many parts of End Game, Alex Jones turns out to be even partially right (and I believe he is)? After all, just because you're a paranoid whack-job doesn't mean someone isn't out to get you.

And fleas, no matter what conclusions you draw about them, do bite.",1211155200,2,4594,5.097074468085107

If you don't get bored here, or disgusted by Jones' antics, what follows is interesting and informative.

I think Mr. Jones should hire a good editor and revise this film.  The Montreal section could have really been tightened up and shortened by at least half without losing anything.  Show who is attending, why that is important.  Cut out the bullhorn and the taunting of the folks in limos, it adds nothing and really hurts the credibility of the film.  Same with the preaching to the regular folks on the street.  I think it's pretty obvious that most people don't know about the Bilderberg Group, so it doesn't really need to be illustrated in the film, at least not in the way they chose to.

All throughout history, as governments gained more power over their people, they began genocidal programs.  These include 60 million in Mao's China, 20 million in Stalin's Russia, 10 Million in Hitler's Germany and many more including 300 million people in the 20th century.  What is most concerning is that these genocidal programs are all related and have become more sophisticated over the years.  The same families and groups have been behind these events and the past instances have been planning, preparation and dress rehearsal for their big event.

So many of the ""world elite"" have said that they want to reduce Earth's population by 90% (500 million) that it is mind boggling.  They often refer to the average person on the street as ""cattle"" or ""useless eater"".  When they meet behind closed doors, they make plans to carry out their genocidal policy.  The movie starts out with Alex exposing their ""secret"" meetings and shows them scurrying around like rats trying to hide from the cameras.

I've studied these parasites which call themselves ""the elite"" for many years.  Endgame is a brilliant work which does an excellent job of exposing their activities.  To document their plans in undeniable detail is truly a monumental task and my hat is off to Endgame.

3184303,3,B000VSDNHS,"I ordered this DVD mainly because, after reading reviews of it, I found myself wondering if maybe Alex Jones is a ""plant,"" whose mission is to link conspiracy theories regarding 911 to such an array of goofball stuff that no one will ever again take the 911 truth movement seriously.  After viewing Engame, I'm still not sure.  Of course everything he says is true - in the sense that there have always been and always will be those who wish to take over the world, as well as those who wish to experiment on, to create a ""better"" version of, and even to destroy most of humanity.  Read up on Robespierre sometime: his ultimate goal was to kill everyone on earth but he and his wife, who would then proceed to re-populate the world with their offspring - just like Adam and Eve.  And, yes, for the first time in history, there actually is the means to accomplish the destruction of the human race.  I have no doubt that pockets of the world's elites constantly plan how to deal with one or another possible catastrophe - such as climate change, which now seems the most likely catastrophe (although Alex Jones believes that climate change, like the entire environmental movement - and even Evolution - is merely a way of duping people into accepting the elites' agenda).  Nor do I doubt for a second that these oligarchs fully understand what may very well happen when the planet heats up, and are actively planning to somehow maintain law and order in the midst of the inevitable chaos.  I'm sure the ruling classes have hundreds of scientists and other professional thinkers on their payroll working day and night to draw up contingency plans to deal with every conceivable catastrophe.  That doesn't mean they intend to put these plans into effect whether there's a catastrophe or not; it simply means that, once again, as humans have done since the dawn of history, they're trying to hold back the inevitable.  They're trying to preserve their personal empires no matter what happens to the rest of the world.  How many times have we seen something like that in the movies?  And, if history is any indication, it doesn't work in real life any better than it does in the movies.  So, yes, be every bit as afraid of these Bilderberg hobgoblins as you would of a marauding horde of Vikings descending on your town; just don't endow them with superhuman or supernatural powers.  They're not the X-Men - no matter how much wealth and power they may have.  If a catastrophe truly is in our future (such as a gamma ray burst or an asteroid collision or even a plague that they themselves unleashed), the Bilderbegs can no more escape the aftermath than the poorest peasant.  They can run but they can't hide.  There's nothing they can do to preserve their empires so much as one second past the appointed hour of their collapse.",1200873600,10,2825,4.642570281124498

3184343,3,B000VSDNHS,"I had heard of the Bilderburg group from friends, but this was my first DVD I have seen on the subject, and I would say it is more appropriate for people who are educated on the subject. It's sort of a ""preaching to the choir"" documentary, not really a good introduction or even overview.

I was intrigued by the people he caught on tape attending the meeting. Why on earth would Governor Pataki and a past ambassador to the U.N. be attending a secret meeting with the Queen of the Netherlands and Rockefeller? That raises a lot of important questions. But the list on the hotel stationary didn't impress me. Anyone can get a hold of hotel stationary at some point in the year, even a guest, and type names on it. The reporter doesn't even know who it comes from. If we knew it was from a credible source, such as a staff member who disagreed with what was going on, it would be different.

His yelling at people with his megaphone really reduced his credibility to me. ""We're not your slaves!"" and he was surprised that attendees laughed at him. I'm not.

I'm part of the vaccine liberation movement, and I see the same thing happen in our fight. People get too close to the issue. They assume everybody knows all the facts and that everyone can keep up. Well we don't all know the whole story, and we can't keep up. People have to be educated by starting at the beginning and supporting your arguments with credible sources. The tone also has to be one where people can be open to the argument and hear you. Starting off being inflammatory and screaming is really going to turn anyone who's not already on the inside off. I'm still interested in this subject, I just wish I'd been introduced in a ""here are the facts"" fashion.",1198108800,124,1728,4.444794952681388
3184344,4,B000VSDNHS,"It is far better to be overly paranoid about those who possess international political power than not paranoid enough.  No one can reasonably acuse Mr. Jones of insufficient paranoia.

This film is doubtlessly over-the-top, but we live in a particularly evil time period where the convergence of different nations into superstates, as well as the rapid progress of control-oriented technology, have served to place humanity in greater jeopardy than perhaps ever before.  This reviewer often wonders if the events of the 20th Century actually took place -- if Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and other mass murderers are only a figment of his imagination.  Most people have learned absolutely nothing from the horrendous crimes these psychopaths committed against humanity (thanks in large part to a school system and mainstream media establishment that serves the interests of the state, rather than the people).  Americans have been successfully conditioned to believe that this nation has a government that is somehow superior to all others, despite the fact that it has engaged in numerous misadventures that have resulted in the mass slaughters of millions of foreigners and thousands of American soldiers.  The U.S. Government is the most treasonous, anti-American institution on the planet.

Mr. Jones' strong grasp of history lends him a credibility that surpasses that of many professional historians -- most of whom are shameless worshippers of government power.  Jones gives the banking cartels and the corporations that own the government their just comeuppance.  Throughout the last couple centuries these institutions have worked for nothing but their own power-hungry purposes -- demonstrating no loyalty to anything other than the pursuit of profit -- to the extreme detriment of mankind.  IBM is singled out for particular reprimand for its partnership with Nazi Germany.  The documentary also rightfully takes the scientific community to task for having engineered the eugenics movement and manipulating the cause of environmentalism to facilitate greater control of the species.  Jones lays out these facts very effectively and shows that his paranoia is not so unreasonable after all.

Where the film falls short is in its depiction of the Bilderberg Group.  Part of the shortcoming here is a product of the group's incredibly secretive nature; it is impossible for an outsider to know exactly what goes on in these meetings.  As a result, one can only guess as to how concerned we should be with this gaggle of international conspirators.  The fact that super-villain Henry Kissinger attends these conferences is scary in and of itself.  Kissinger is bashed several times during ENDGAME, which is another plus of the film.  This sickening neo-fascist has repeatedly promoted the disgustingly inhumane and racist policy of depopulating Africa while also praising the push for a New World Order.  This vampire is the perfect representative of all that is wrong with  political power lust and the vicious costs it exacts on mankind.

This film is highly recommended.  It makes a great case against massive government and for the federalism -- the splitting up of power between federal, state, and local -- upon which this nation was supposed to be founded.  Call Alex Jones a kook, a conspiracy nut, an agitator, or some other pejorative label; regardless of the truth of such accusations, his patriotism is beyond reproach.  And his documentary is intriguing and informative and it should be taken seriously by all those who do not want to live under a fascist one-world state.",1198022400,7,3584,5.291519434628976

I thought the first part of the film was a little slow because I already have researched and accept the reality of the Bilderburgers and CFR groups.

But boy, the second part has opened my eyes.  The facts of life came at me hard and fast.  Eugenics sounds sensible on the face of it.  Two people with a week or defective genealogy will likely produce the same in their offspring. The frightening point of the movie is that skin color eye color, body type or ethnicity could be considered weak or defective.  The reality of the elite's population reduction came home to me and there is no denying what they are planning after checking on Mr. Jones' research.

3184348,4,B000VSDNHS,"This is a very good overview of what is happening, and has happened in recent times that clearly point to a global plan drawn up by, and executed by, global elites and those they control.
This Alex Jones production makes clear connections between some well known, and some not so well known, major events in the 20th century and connects the dots to events taking place around us now. If you don't know who the ""Bilderbergers"" are, and how much they control, you will by the films end. The secret groups, secret agreements and the visible consequences of these, are revealed to a great extent.
It does an excellent job of revealing how the elitists of society have come together to control the path of economics, politics, our dwindling freedoms,wars,eugenics (decreasing the population of the world through selective methods),religion, and what their possible plans are for us in the near future.
The documentary includes interviews with those who have studied globalism and the elites of the world for many years, as well as other well educated and some well known personalities who are not afraid to speak their mind on this subject.
This film will shock those who are not aware of what is going on behind the scenes in world events. It will give you a lot to consider, and will at times frighten you to realize how much control globalist desire over our individual lives.
My only criticism of the film is that I think Mr. Jones did spend a little too much time filming his, and others experiences at the Bilderberg meetings in Ottawa and in Turkey. Most of these sections of the film don't really add a greater appreciation of what the entire film is focused on. I think some of those sections of the film would have been better used to give more time talking to other experts and going into some deeper history of and detail of what globalism is going to mean for all of us.
Personally I would have liked to see more time spent on discussing the speeches by Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy during their presidencies that warned America and the world of the elitists plans.

End Game is a well crafted and informative expose of various aspects of the fascist/collectivist eugenicist  power play that is currently unfolding behind closed doors. It's a nail in the coffin for those poor and deluded folk who have ,in many respects,deified man and refuse to recognise his darker and more perverse nature which seems to be amplified in those people who wield power.
People need to set aside their rose tinted spectacles and watch this film with an open mind. Of course,it's nigh on impossible to cover all aspects of the tyranny that is being imposed on nations in one film but this is a good place to start and will open doors elsewhere. I would combine this movie with a viewing of ""Terror storm"" ,again from the Alex Jones stable,the Youtube Audio interview with Naomi Wolf and Jones and the Channel 4 produced documentary,""The great global warming swindle"" Just these few sources of information will help to form a more cohesive picture of what is going on with our societies.

3184422,5,B000VSDNHS,"Whenever I see anything by Alex Jones, I can't help but think of a story I heard years ago that supposedly happened in New Guinea. Seems that when the first medical missionaries went into the highlands, the tribes were deeply suspicious of them, and doubted that their medicine was any good. When the missionaries finally discovered the reason why, they were astonished.

Apparently villages in the New Guinea highlands were (and still are today) heavily infested with fleas that bite pigs, dogs and humans alike. The New Guinea tribesmen, who were natural skilled observers, were quite familiar with the habits of these fleas and knew that every healthy human and animal would have no small number of them. They also noted correctly that whenever anyone got sick, the fleas immediately fled them for another host. However, these tribesmen weren't quite so good at drawing accurate conclusions from their observations. At some point they decided that since only healthy animals and people had fleas, the fleas must be the cause of their good health. Everyone should have them! The missionaries didn't, so...

So it is with Jones. Every time I see one his films (and End Game is, in every sense, his best film to date) I am amazed and fascinated at the impressive body of facts he gathers together. The Bilderberg group does, in fact, exist and meets in extreme secrecy precisely as described in the film. His description of how Rothchilds' crashed and then bought up the British economy for pennies on the dollar is historical fact. It is no secret that certain banks and other financial institutions have funded both sides of nearly every major war in the 20th century, and the U.S. has a long history of arming both sides of national and regional conflicts. The Georgia Guidestones and their peculiar origins are real...Google Earth will take you right to them. The 1974 Kissinger report which mentions the need for depopulation exists (I've read it in its entirety).  Jones' background research for this film  is easily confirmed at any local library and generally impeccable.

Alex Jones is far less credible, however, when he attempts to weave all of these facts into a broad ""master plan for world domination."" Many of his conclusions seem to stand cause and effect on their heads, while others seem to reflect a strong personal, and likely religious bias. For example, Jones and his supporters dismiss all of the crises we face in the coming century - fossil fuel depletion, climate change, global warming, declining supplies of food and fresh water world-wide - as nothing but hoaxes concocted by the global elite as the premise for bringing about their plans for world domination, despite the existence massive volumes of evidence that would suggest exactly the opposite. He has a special contempt for environmentalists of any stripe, universally condemning them as a vital part of the global elites' plan. This is ironic, considering that many environmentalists, peak oilers, human rights activists etc. sound the same warnings of economic chaos, rising police states world-wide, and population collapse Jones himself does, howbeit for somewhat different reasons. While I have not read much about Jones' personal religious views, what he says in much of his work is very much in harmony with  Christian Fundamentalist groups in my part of the country, which would provide a clear explanation for this.

Jones is also well-known for highly selective use of quotations by well-known figures to support his theories, while ignoring many other things they also said. For example it is completely true that Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and H.G. Wells, (among many others)  were staunch supporters of eugenics - in its early days.  What wasn't mentioned,however, was that every one of them totally renounced that support as they came to realize the terrible acts and policies eugenics could be used to justify. Aldous Huxley, for example, wrote Brave New World in the 30's as a cautionary tale - a warning of the terrible things that could happen if the theories of eugenics, organic evolution etc were taken to certain logical extremes. Bertrand Russell fiercely denounced Hitler and the Nazi movement from its very beginnings, and his name appeared prominently at the top of a Gestapo list of people to be executed immediately when the Nazis succeeded in taking Britain.

A final, major annoyance in this film is the disproportionate amount of time devoted to Jones ranting on a bullhorn at the Bilderberg  delegates in Ottawa. Most of his taunts,such as ""we're not your slaves,"" and ""the answer to 1984 is 1776"" are downright pathetic, and help brand Jones as a 'paranoid whack job.' Small wonder the Bilderbergs and other global elites are content to completely ignore him.

Despite these criticisms, I recommend End Game as a five-star film. Here's why.

If End Game weren't presented as a documentary, I would still recommend it as the best Science Fiction film I had seen in many years. I mean no disrespect when I say this. Science fiction (not the Sci-fi Channel crap, the real thing) in its highest form is better called speculative fiction...it asks the question 'what if...?' and then produces a story that attempts to answer it. Even as fiction End Game is a chilling and provocative story. Science fiction, after all, doesn't describe something that is actually happening, but rather something that theoretically/reasonably could happen.

So, what if?

What if a small group of people actually did want to dominate the world? What if they had learned the lessons of history and understood that no single nation or political entity could ever accomplish it. How would they pull it off?

Suppose this international group, bound not by nationality or ethnic affiliation but rather by a common world-view, realized that the way to world domination lay in taking total control of the world's financial infrastructure - its central banks, stock markets, and lending institutions, rather than by military conquest. And what if, for the first time in human history, the technology existed to actually carry out their plans...to shape public opinion, to form corporations richer and more influential than most of the world's governments, and to control the policies of the rest through foreign aid, trade and debt?  What if...?

What if...?

...despite the limitations and blatant silliness in many parts of End Game, Alex Jones turns out to be even partially right (and I believe he is)? After all, just because you're a paranoid whack-job doesn't mean someone isn't out to get you.

And fleas, no matter what conclusions you draw about them, do bite.",1196294400,27,6680,5.060964513193812

3184426,4,B000VSDNHS,"Alex Jones is a radio host and documentary film maker based out of Austin, Texas.  His documentaries revolve around the global movements that led to the European Union, the United Nations, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers and other opinion and policy making groups bent on dominating the world.

This particular documentary, his newest, looks at the 'New World' nirvana proposed by the elite of the world.

The first question that needs to be answered is, ""Are there really conspiracies bent on world domination?""  Well, since these organizations themselves admit and publish this publicly, only a fool would say no.  David Rockefeller, founding member of many of these globalist secret combinations, stated flat out in his recent biography that global domination was exactly what he has been working for.

Understand that there are kooks out there who believe all kinds of weird stuff from alien abductions to ESP and paganism.  Alex Jones is not one of these people.

This documentary follows a meeting of the ""Bilderbergers"", a group of secretive policy makers including heads of industry and state.  This documentary details the ""eugenics"" movement as well as anything I have seen or read.  These elite look for a world where 80% of the current world's population has been killed off through various means.

Like many of you, I used to think such things were impossible.  But in my first career as a biologist, I would more and more often hear giants in the field of science say things like ""Thank God for malaria in the third world!""  I would be shocked at such racist, idiotic, genocidal talk and would look around at the circle of listeners nodding in agreement.  These people really do believe that diseases killing millions of people are a good thing.  I watch as diverse fields like business, government, education, and medicine all seem to converge to the same one-world socialist solutions.  I watch idiotic ideas like socialized medicine, global warming being caused by man-made CO2, and illegal immigration crammed down our throats even though upwards of 90% of the citizens oppose these ideas.  And the only explanation is to believe the organized criminals who head up education, industry and the government really do mean what they say.

So watch this and wake up.  I also recommend several other doumentaries by the same film-maker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terrorstorm-2nd-Edition/dp/B000QGE89W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition</a>, on 9-11 and other similar terrorist incidents,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Secrets-and-The-Order-of-Death-Inside-Bohemian-Grove/dp/B000RWCAAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Secrets and The Order of Death: Inside Bohemian Grove</a>, a scary examination of a 100 year old retreat where Presidents, and World rulers meet and perform a mock human sacrifice to Moloch (yes, that Moloch - the one in the old testament that pagans used to sacrifice their children to).  You won't believe it until you see it.

Negatives of the film are parts are repetitious.  The Bilderberger meetings part didn't say exactly what was going on at the meeting, it only showed these people showing up to this meeting.  I think more evidence of the links between these groups and current governmental policy would make the case better.

These two quoted phrases are how elites will rule us in easily controlled units. Like, umm, countries, only the good-looking computer graphics in this documentary make the thing look more organized. I guess if you say enough times that Europe, North America, and a number of Asian countries will turn it into giant power blocs devoid of national sovereignty, viewers will believe it.

Jones himself is stopped and DELAYED at the Ottawa airport by the Powers-That-Be who only release him when a crack team of Internet journalists show up. Power of the Press!

If there IS a global conspiracy and Jones and his friends have stumbled on it, do you really think their DVDs would be appearing on Amazon.com? The United States government, a single political entity, snatches people from their homes all over the world and secretes them in secret in prisons in many countries not to be heard from for months or years later. Don't you think the most powerful men and women in the world, bent on global domination--and not just greed and egotism, as really motivates bad people--would tolerate such canaries calling out in the coalmine?

This is fun, fun, fun. Just don't expect to take it seriously. If you do, I recommend you tackle some history from historians, not these crackpots. History teaches us that people come up with terrible ideas that fail and kill millions of people. Wars gets started over frivolous things. Men and women profit from those wars. The truth in history is that humans are cruel, sometimes evil, and should be punished and rooted out. Unfortunately, the REAL job of digging into the REAL power structures of governments, militaries, and corporations must be left to journalists and freethinkers who don't waste their time on Art Bell shows and Endgame.

The elites will then use powerful technologies (currently available but held in top secrecy) to essentially live forever. Sounds crazy, like a science fiction novel right?
One would have to think that the claims and allegations contained within this documentary are outlandish and crazy. I mean, this is all just made up, right? As a naturally born skeptic who is taught to think critically, I always research and cross reference any stated claim against criteria to the contrary. Also, checking a claims' factual content for opinionated bias is a very important warning flag to look for. Often facts are skewed in documentaries to create an opinionated context to apply those said facts. It is concurrently important to see what the ""other side"" is saying in rebuttal.
 I can tell you honestly that this film is well documented and sourced. There is a lot of hard, honest evidence to support the claims in this film. There is also little information to oppose that programs of eugenics and genocide are in full effect now and have throughout history.  There are few claims out there that can actually refute the data that Alex Jones presents. In fact, Alex seems to whitewash the severety of these claims with conservative numbers! He also does not seem to present the information in biased contexts, but presents the material for you to see how anyone would come to these conclusions.
 If you actually do the research, and follow the history, you will find that things are worse that Mr. Jones presents!
 The worst part of it all is that you are not going to get much information about these secret elites meetings, because they are SECRET!!! The fact that many powerful and influential government and corporate leaders are meeting in heavily guarded secrecy to talk about ""us common people"" should worry everyone.

I have watched Endgame on google video, which Alex Jones doesn't mind, he also says we can copy the DVDs and burn them onto disk and hand them out to people, which is exactly why I just ordered the Endgame DVD from Amazon (and I want to see this in high quality sexyness).

This is the information you need, to heke with the other documentaries, this is the most important video you could ever watch in your lifetime.  Do I recommend it?  Yes.  I recommend you know the truth, I recommend you snap out of the world you think you know it to be, I recommend you to visit Alex's websites on a daily basis, I recommend you make copies of this DVD and give it to friends and family, I recommend you turn off your Televisions once and for all, get out there and do something to stop this.

This is your country, and never forget that.",1194998400,10,1591,4.414383561643835
3184497,5,B000VSDNHS,"To long time fans, Alex Jones' hallmark is his guerilla-style, raw, ""underground resistance"" approach to film making. Colleagues of mine have taken issue with the credibility of the Police State series, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and the like. The facts were all there, but people in Western culture tend to be more receptive to style over substance. Last year, Terrorstorm crossed the threshold into the realm of mainstream documentary cinematography. This year, Endgame plants the flag in the soil.

...and rightfully so, for it is Jones' most important film to date, dealing with the gravest threat to free humanity on planet Earth. Again, the facts are all documented, but when wed to excellent editing, a dark and powerful score, and a fluid, logical presentation of concepts and information (another area upon which Jones has vastly improved) Endgame is indeed a sharp blow to skull, both shocking the unacquainted viewer from sleep, and smashing the mask off of the New World Order itself.

Even if you don't believe in the whole ""New World Order"", you should still see this movie. You absolutely can not deny the evidence. Alex Jones makes a point to back his claims up with hard evidence from multiple sources, that's why he has such a strong following. I know there are many skeptics  who refer to believers or ""truthers"" as Weird-os or Kooks. I like to refer to them as TRUE PATRIOTS! Wake up AMERICA, before it's too late. It's sick and twisted what the ""Elite"" are doing to us. You will experience many emotions watching this movie. If you don't then you are already dead. If you still have your doubts after this movie, then look at the evidence yourself. Alex Jones wants you to do some research to prove him wrong. I try to prove him wrong, but unfortunatly I can't!

THE FILM IS GREAT, don't get me wrong, I just think more ppl will be left in the dark with the End Game thoughts and not want to believe, and that in turn is what we fight against, people need to know and not dismiss these beliefs.  Not an introductory film to the masses, I would give it 5 stars, but these shortcomings (imo) make me have to give it 4.

3184516,5,B000VSDNHS,"As an avid Alex Jones listener, I knew much of what was in this film, but there was a lot of information that was brand new, and just as important.

Bottom line is: this is an absolute must-see for anyone who wants to know what is really going on in the world, and for anyone who wants to be ahead of the game when it all comes down in a big way.

The information in this film will not only motivate people to save our country, but it will also motivate people to speak out against the genocides that have been happening in our world for centuries at the hands of these evil international elite.  At the very least, people will have the information necessary to do whatever they can to save themselves and their families.

Although most uninformed people simply do not believe what I tell them about what is happening in this world, this film will not elicit the same reaction because Alex has backed up everything in his film with THEIR OWN WORDS.  It is absolutely chilling.

The amazing thing about this film is that it MAKES SENSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS WORLD TODAY. A thousand things can happen without any rhyme or reason, but when you see this film, the things that are happening in this world will suddenly look completely different with your new knowledge.

I have watched this DVD twice, and I still have not picked up everything that is in this film.  It is very well done, and will keep you interested until the end.",1194912000,12,1434,4.40530303030303

3184519,5,B000VSDNHS,"Gawd, it took all night to watch this goliath!  But this is a good thing.  Alex has done it again, watching the watchers, exposing their agendas, giving us mountains of facts and theories to study and research.  And that is the one thing a person should do after watching any documentary!  Don't take anybody's word for anything.  Check it out for yourself.  This is exactly what Alex Jones encourages people to do.  Don't believe me?  Listen to his show.  He gets furious with people's ignorance.  He makes these documentaries to try and educate people and return them to a state of rational self-thinking, i.e., cure their zombieism.

I loved the part where he bullhorned the Bilderburgers, and stood up tough against them.  There's not too many who would dare sneer at the global elite, but Alex proves once again his unlove for world tyrants.  Isn't that truly the American thing to do?  To stand up to tyrants?  Any Americans out there remember their forefathers?

I'm also glad Alex finally took some time to expose Darwin and Galton and the entire evolution/eugenics crowd.  He'd been threatening to get that out in a documentary for a long time.  Kudos, Alex.  People need to better understand who Charles Darwin was before they endorse his theories.

There was also some good info on the Trans-Texas Corridor and how the coming wave of illegals is serving a global purpose.  Again I say to also listen to Alex Jones' radio show!  He's very quick to point out that it's not ""mexicans"" that are the problem.  There is a very real global cabal to destroy American sovereignty, and Mexican Nationals are only a fraction of the problem.  These Nationals ARE NOT coming here to become Americans!  They ARE NOT immigrants.  Though there are obviously legitimate Mexicans trying desperately to immigrate legally to America.  May God bless them!

But the Trans-Texas Corridor isn't only about illegal immigration!  Watch the documentary to learn more!  There's also info about the coming North American Union and plans to funnel people into super-cities for easier control

I'm really gonna have to go back and watch this again.  I watched the first time from Prisonplanet.tv.  So now I've bought this film from Amazon.  Can't wait to watch the DVD!  Get your's today.

The Georgia Guidestones and many eugenics papers and opinions are so effective that many people buy into the ""there are too many humans"" argument.

A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones by RC Christian in 1979 to give us eugenics propoganda, I mean guidance.  It is inscribed in stone in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Ancient Chinese and Russian. The message in English reads:

Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.
Unite humanity with a living new language.
Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
Balance personal rights with social duties.
Prize truth - beauty - love - seeking harmony with the infinite.
Be not a cancer on the earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature.

A shorter message appears on the four vertical surfaces of the capstone, again in a different language and script on each face. The explanatory tablet near the Guidestones identifies these languages/scripts as Babylonian Cuneiform (north), Classical Greek (east), Sanskrit (south), and Egyptian Hieroglyphs (west), and provides what is presumably an English translation: ""Let these be guidestones to an age of reason.""

Terrorstorm is a good primer for Endgame, though each film certainly stands on its own, because the information in each of Alex Jones' films builds upon the foundation of the film before it. Nevertheless, I think that anyone with a discerning mind can follow along just fine and come to his or her own conclusions about the factual truths contained therein.

Well, this film will wake you up to the reality of it all. Not only the fact that these organisations exist, but that they have some horrific stuff planned for us all. You might see the war on terror and the cult of carbon footprint / man made global warming mythology in a different light after watching this.

The information about the Bilderberg group wasn't anything new to me, but the back story and history of the eugenics societies was all new and quite a revelation.

The problem is, the narrative conclusion of Endgame is going to be hard for Alex to beat. The facts and issues raised in Endgame: depopulation, controlled societies, forced evolution of man through the power of genetics, these issues are certainly at the core of our entire corrupted system, and these issues should be addressed right now among all people of the Earth. Are we to evolve as a free dynamic race, or are we going to let a small group of bankers and elitists steer society in a direction of their choosing? Endgame provides a lot of questions, and even the answers provide only more questions. But how is this to be topped? What more needs to be said or proven about our ruling elite to show them for the evil, sadistic men they are?

Unless undeniable proof that our ruling class is made up of aliens from another planet, I fail to see anything coming close to the facts brought to the surface by Alex Jones in Endgame.
