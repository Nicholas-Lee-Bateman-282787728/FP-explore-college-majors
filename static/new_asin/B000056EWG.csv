7931820,5,B000056EWG,I received this as a Christmas gift and am so looking forward to seeing again. It is incredibly sad but so moving and the performances are phenominal.,1357084800,,150,4.592592592592593
7931821,3,B000056EWG,"First , I really wanted to like this movie even though I did not expect another Schindler's List type feature. The producers must have saved a lot on the very restrictive set. Let's not forget that this is the Warsaw ghetto but there are plenty of other movies which are not so claustrophobic. I'm sure this claustrophobia is more related to a limited budget than to the artistic message they want to send. 2 other things which in my opinion did not go well: The main character may be a good actor but he does not fit the physical description of a rabbi very well - especially his facial features. Without giving out the ending, I do not believe a father and especially a rabbi would have acted in the manner portrayed, but would rather have used his body as a shield for the endangered party in question.

I realize I was somehow negative in this review - there's plenty of positives and I don't feel repeating the other reviewers.",1148601600,4,932,4.482352941176471
