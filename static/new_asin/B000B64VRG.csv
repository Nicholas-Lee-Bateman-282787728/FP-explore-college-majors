8082074,4,B000B64VRG,"Clive Turned from The Howling V: The Rebirth returns in this final installment of the original timeline series as the wise cracking Australian Ted.  In this installment he is on search of the same werewolf who stalked and nearly killed him in Romania, Mary Lou also played by returned Elizabeth Shue.  This final installment takes you back to The Howlings 4, 5 and 6 and explains how Elizabeth Shue's character is in each one.  This film also sees the return of Romy Windsor as Marie from The Howling IV.  Even though a lot of the extras cast in this installment aren't 100% good actors the film does have a ton of comedic moments that will make you chuckle and laugh and by the end of the film you will understand the events from The Howling IV - VI.",1504051200,,751,4.420289855072464
8082075,2,B000B64VRG,"Released in 1995, Howling: New Moon Rising chronicles events in a small California desert town after a long-haired Australian rides into town on his Harley (Clive Turner) and a series of murders occurs. A priest insists its the work of a demonic werewolf (John Huff ) and a detective (John Ramsden) zeroes-in on the stranger.

Clive Turner, the producer/director/writer/star was forced to use non-actors due to his limited non-budget. The only figure I could find was $250,000, but some would argue that it sounds like too much. Whatever the case, the bad actors, the focus on country music and the scarcity of a werewolf understandably prompts loathing from most viewers. But, if you can acclimate to the lousy non-acting, the storys another werewolf mystery in the mold of 1988s Howling IV and 1989s Howling V, both of which Turner wrote and had a bit part.

What I like about this installment is that it tries to connect all the movies with flashbacks to the two aforementioned flicks and, if you listen carefully, makes references to the others. It also brings back Romy Windsor from IV and regularly references Elizabeth Shs character from V; Sh is also listed in the cast, but I couldn't pinpoint her, except in the flashback scenes (the comely woman in the yellow shirt at the end is Cheryl Allen, not Sh). The other thing I like about it is that its consistently amusing with several corny jokes and you can tell the cast had a good time together.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Pioneertown and nearby Yucca Valley, California.
