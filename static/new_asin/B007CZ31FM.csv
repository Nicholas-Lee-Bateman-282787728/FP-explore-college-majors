5078966,1,B007CZ31FM,This was just terrible. Just terrible. I usually like everything. Low budget movies aren't always bad but this was. This must have been written by a child. Not just any child but a slow one at that. The kids in this movie just didn't even try. I never wanted kids to die so bad. There's basically no dialogue. Just slow sleepy music and even slower kids going nowhere. Spoiler alert! The ending is just ridiculous. They turn into mermaids! What? For real? And theres a giant octopus! What? Don't waste your money or your time. Please! I beg you don't watch this movie.,1337385600,4,568,4.524271844660194
5078967,2,B007CZ31FM,"""Everyone lost hope and their worst fears became reality."" In the future a strange virus takes hold of the world turning everyone into zombies. While the world is being overrun a few children are born immune to the disease. One little girl begins a trip to the ocean where she thinks she will find safety. She meets a few more children like her and together the must avoid the zombies as well as the military to get to their goal. I have to admit that based on the cover and the preview I was expecting lameness. While I can't say this is a great movie it was much better then I expected. I do however think the pitch meeting went like this : So you want to make a zombie movie with very little talking, or plot. Just a little girl walking and watching people get eaten until she finds water. Is that right? Yes that is correct. OK, here is 5 million dollars...have fun. I am not a fan of zombie movies but this one was watchable and much better then I was expecting. The end is bizarre and is worth watching just for that though. Overall, much better then expected and fans of zombie movies will probably like this a lot. I say C+.",1336867200,,1132,4.24537037037037
5078968,1,B007CZ31FM,"If amazon gave refunds because a movie sucked, this would be #1 in line.  We went in expecting a zombie flick.  What we got was...  I don't even know.

It starts off with an interesting premise.  People get infected from an airborne virus, and there's a few group of kids that are immune.  They use way too many flashbacks to tell a semi-interesting story, while the current time story is ridiculously boring.  It's filled with horrible acting, horrible cinematography, horrible graphics, and the worst screenplay ever.  Be ready to be put to sleep by a zombie movie....oh and if you're actually awake at the end... the ending is so comical, it'll just blow your mind away...  and not in a good way.

so, amazon, when you read this, please refund me my $3.99.  Thanks.",1336262400,4,768,4.656716417910448

8514845,5,B007CZ31FM,"Visionary Chilean director Jorge Olguin has made a fantastic allegory and metaphorical masterpiece with this astonishing film.  While utilizing a rather overused story premise of a zombie apocalypse, Olguin breathes new life into the concept and creates a blasted post-apocalyptic landscape with haunting imagery and vast vistas  of devastation.  This is a lonely, frightening world in which surviving children attempt to survive while fleeing merciless soldiers.  A zombie virus has infected the world and these innocents are immune from the rampaging evil of the living dead.  Referencing global warning and former Chilean dictatorships, this is a deeply disturbing and challenging film.  The cinematography is well done indeed and captures the out-of-kilter world beautifully.  There are also numerous elements of magic realism that highlight the other worldly surrealism essential to the saga.  A very creative, unique motion picture that is certainly much more than a zombie horror film and is a powerfully moving  artistic cinema accomplishment.  The brilliant ending is breathtaking and will leave audiences virtually staggered.",1439337600,,1135,5.783132530120482
8514846,2,B007CZ31FM,"If you ever wanted to see a Zombie flick from Chile, do not miss this chance.  It may take a while before we see another one.
 We can give The Descendents snaps for good Zombie makeup and muted if occasionally graphic dinning shots.  I also like the sound track which I thought upbeat in the right places and added to the tension in other places.  I think I like Chilean hip-hop more than I like the US variety.  The artistic choice of filming in washed out colors could have a positive value as well.  Viewers see a bleak landscape and humanscape brought into bold focus only by the scarlet outburst of color at the mouths of the infected.
 That makes up the list of the good stuff.  Most of the film consists of watching little kids flee from either Zombies or from soldiers sent out to eliminate the bio-hazards.  The kids are too small to really act ranging from about 10 down to 4 or 5.  They aren't asked to do much anyway.  The kids we meet are special, born after the Zombie outbreak.  They have regular, bloody cuts on their necks which most kids do not and they are not troubled by the Zombies.  Only in a few places to we hear actual dialog the rest of the narrative is covered by a voice over by little Camille, the protagonist.  Eventually a few surviving neck sliced children make it to the sea where a city block sized octopus protects them from attacking helicopters.  We fade out with a child's drawing of mermaids as we show webbing developing on the hands of the children.
 The CGI effects are primitive.  We see occasional helicopters or fighter planes flying around and sometimes attacking something or other off screen.  The aircraft add nothing to the film and are bad enough to be actually distracting.
 So Director Jorge Olguin filmed an incoherent story written by himself and Carolina Garcia.  The movie consists of watching children walking around holding hands while big people are either shot by soldiers or gobbled up by Zombies.  A magic octopus saves them.  I would say that there isn't any actual acting save for some grown-ups in very brief shots done in flash back to explain why little Camille arrived at her predicament.
 Olguin also produced and had a few other credits.  He has a current career in the Chilean film industry as a producer, actor, director and writer.  The most recent of his seven films came out in 2014.
 I found this one and a half brain movie tedious.  I can recommend it only to those of us who want to see as many Zombie movies from as many countries as possible.  The R rated film is short at only one hour and 14 minutes.
 Distributed in the USA by Ghosthouse Underground on DVD.",1415232000,,2642,4.503157894736842
8514847,2,B007CZ31FM,"This was an oops, saw this before & didn't like it then either.  Ok, so the movie had zombies but this story wasn't quite suited for zombies.  In my opinion kids & zombies don't play well together on the big screen never mind an entire movie revolving around the two.  The syory was predicated upon the children reaching the sea & what a let down that was.",1384732800,,356,4.2835820895522385
8514848,3,B007CZ31FM,"Going into this movie, you have to ask yourself if you can look past the the horrible camera filters, shaky cam, bad CG effects, half-assed acting, slow pace, filler in the form of continuous flashbacks of the same scenes over & over again, & a WTF ending to enjoy a unique zombie apocalypse told from a child's perspective, where zombies are passive, & living soldiers are the bad guys. Having already sat through Birdemic, Pot Zombies, The Amazing Bulk, & Pulse 2, I was prepared & hoped for so-bad-it's-good.

The world has gone to hell & no one can expect any kind of basic human rights from those in power. The living scientists & soldiers seem to be a bigger threat to the living than the zombies, tearing apart families & killing indiscriminately. The children are immune, so scientists forcibly separate them from their parents & strap them to chairs, hoping to find a cure, but for unexplained reasons, soldiers are very eager to kill these children without hesitation.

An annoying oddity is that even though the infected mother tells the girl that zombies won't harm the immune, she insists that the girl run away from her & not come near. This scene is the most overplayed flashback, so the mother's break in logic here is really hammered into your head.

In the opening narration, the girl basically tells you how the movie is going to end; it's so absurd that you immediately put it out of your mind until it actually happens, & there is no explanation for for it at all.

In the end, it was terrible, but you should still see it once if you enjoy a good train wreck. I think with a higher budget, more experienced cast, some rewriting, & a different ending, this could be remade into a decent movie.",1383609600,,1714,4.591503267973856

8514851,3,B007CZ31FM,"It's easy to rate this a two or one star affair. Lets be honest most very low budget  horror movies are one or two star at most compared to most other flicks. But if you love horror movies and low budget ones shouldn't they have their own rating system? It's only fair. So on a VERY low budget this one does some impressive work. The lead actress is a little girl and she's quite good and should have a future in film. Hopefully without getting involved in dope etc later on. She carries the flick as she wanders around , the cgi is very impressive in this flick. It's amazing what can be done these days even with a very small budget. The cities look very realistic and ruined. The helicopters look real too at least until the end shot. The film however did grate on me with it's constant flash back to the little girl and her mother escaping a research station. Frankly it's better just to do ONE flashback. Few films can get away with one than one flashback of the same  past event. It's distracting and it doesn't work. the story is limited but engaging as the little girl and other kids try to stay alive. In this one , the infected don't hunt them it's soldiers who do. The ending is well strange and surreal and sorta blows the whole movie but until then it was ok. This is really a two star flick on a normal scale but this tried to be different and it's ok. The infected utilize very limited makeup because they aren't zombies really because they are still alive.  SO if you enjoy a VERY low budget horror film that is a little different then you might enjoy this. Or you may not, if you are not a fan of low budget horror then this aint for you. This was shot in chile and they speak english in this movie because english is the worlds language, the film though doesn't take place in chile , it's taking place in a unnamed place. There is a documentary extra which shows how even with little money you can make digital images appear filmlike in postproduction.  when even this low of budget can do that , then you can see why film will start vanishing probably.",1345939200,,2071,4.289002557544757
8514852,1,B007CZ31FM,"I love horror movies. I love bad horror movies and I love good horror movies. Being a George Romero fan I love zombie movies too. But when a zombie movie goes bad it goes really bad. That happens with this film.

In the future a virus has killed most everyone turning them into blood seeking zombies. But a few survivors have had children that have a natural immunity to the disease. Not only that, the zombies don't attack or attempt to eat these children. With three bloody lines across their necks, you know exactly what is coming. Hello? Gills anyone?

The story is told by a young girl as she treks her way to the sea where her dreams have told her to go in search of a giant octopus and a ship that will take these children away. Spoiler alert if you care: yes, they reach their destination and they then change.

It doesn't make a difference if I told you the outcome of this movie or not. Having to sit through it was torture that even being eaten alive would have possibly been better experiencing. The film takes the zombie motif and tries to turn it into an art film. Ho hum. The worst sin a horror movie can make is to be boring. This film does that in spades.  Let me just say that a second viewing of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE would be more entertaining than this film. Watch it at your own risk.",1344470400,,1308,4.240963855421687
8514853,3,B007CZ31FM,"Well. How can you describe this one? That's kind of hard. The first thing that comes to mind is ""Hey, what kind of zombie movie do you think Andy Warhol would have made if Troma had hired him to make one?"" If you even understand that at all, then you've kind of got an idea of what to expect. This is pretty much an arthouse style flick. It follows the journey of a lone little girl in a post-apocalyptic wasteland while paralleling this story to the story of how the little girl ended up away from her mother. In this future, the air is not breathable except by a certain few children who have been born with strange cuts on their neck that will not heal. All adults and otherwise turn into zombies when they breath the air. Oh yeah - the zombies don't bother the little kids so that is kind of a main thing. At first the pseudo-military adult element is trying to do experiments on the kids, then it seems like they are more bent on just hunting them down and killing them (?) The music is mostly piano or post-rock build up, so it is fairly effective when not a bit overblown and nagging. Fairly effective use of color and filter-style to convey when we are in flashbacks, current time, and just making some neat transitions. Though the washed-out bleach bypass image style used throughout most of the movie does get a bit tedious to look at after awhile. The cinematography is strongly above average for the budget and I found myself more entertained by this than the actual story, which is somewhat thinly spread. To be honest, this might have been more effective as a short film, though it still only comes in at around an hour long. The ending, and i mean literally the last 30 seconds to a minute of the movie, are totally confusing. It just turns out the movie isn't about what you thought it was about the whole time, but not in a ""oh what a twist! Niiiiice!"" kind of way ... more of a ""WTF was that?!?!"" kind of way. I'll admit, I had a funny look at my face and literally scratched my head at the ending. I promise you'll do the same. So, considering the budget and artistic goals of the film, I'll give it an above average rating on my zombie scale. Its worth watching if you're into this kind of thing - if you're not, then you'll most certainly hate it.",1342310400,,2268,4.326291079812207
8514854,4,B007CZ31FM,"Like the others said, I went into this with low expectations. Which makes the movie much better. I'm zombie obsessed but that doesn't mean I won't rip apart a bad movie.

I actually liked this movie for the artsy take it took. The black and white. Splashes of color and especially the no need for the gore.

However the ending was horrible and I'm glad I wasn't the only one that thought so. I was tempted to rewatch because I figured I missed something. But obviously from other reviews I did not. The ending just went willy-nilly into it's own wrap up which meant nothing. I wrote more of a post at my new site [...]",1339632000,,618,4.318965517241379
