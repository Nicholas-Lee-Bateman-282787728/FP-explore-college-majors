3874961,5,B0028X36EE,"I loved WCW back in the day, in fact i'd say that from 1996 to about early 1999 I prefered it to the WWF.  And while the Monday Night War was very one sided, I think that this documentary will be more even.  Former WCW'ers like Big Show, Ric Flair, Rey Mysterio, Hurricane Helms, Chavo Guerrero, Arn Anderson, William Regal, Ricky Steamboat, Dean Malenko and Jim Ross all will be included for sure.  Plus I'm sure they have stock footage of Hall, Nash, Booker, Bischoff, Steiner, Bret (from his dvd), Eddie and Goldberg talking about it as well.  I'd like to see Luger, DDP, Sid etc get interviewed as well but who knows.

My other hope is that not too many of the DVD releases from WWE lately have had alot of overlap in matches, so we may get a good many new to DVD matches.",1243900800,,776,4.287671232876712
3874962,4,B0028X36EE,"I already wrote a review before this dvd was released, and it was pretty accurate about what this dvd had in store. Jim Ross said the documentary was an eye opener, I found it boring and nothing really new. This is a less then a half attempt of WWE cashing in on something people miss. They should do like ECW and get tons of former WCW wrestlers to do a dvd over the Real Rise and Fall of WCW. Matter of fact, I prefer readint the book Death of WCW rather then watch the dvd again.

Matches. I use to crave watching a Sting-Vader match and now it seems every current WWE dvd with a WCW match on it includes these two wrestle a match. I'd rather watch Vader VS Hogan, even though it cost Vader his career in the USA. The Sting-Rude match looked promising but I found it boring. The ending saw the ref get knocked out. However, he is laying on the mat and still watching the action. Harley Race accidentally hits Rude with a chair and cost him the match. All while the ref was watching the action, stupid. Anyways, a few matches have already been released on other sets and the unseen ones are awesome to boring. The Rude-Sting match would fall into the boring category.

Overall, the biography over WCW was boring and took too long to watch. The matches are the only real reason why you'd want to own this set. I also recommend if you read to check out The Death of WCW. A helluva lot better then the biography.",1243209600,,1411,4.2611940298507465
3874963,5,B0028X36EE,"The Rise and Fall of WCW!

First off this should be atleast a 3-DVD Set...At the least! Covering Ted Turner's purchase (1990), thru the ""rebuilding"" years (1991-1993, thru the WWF superstar invasion (1994-1996), thru the ""New World Order"" years (1996-1997) all the way its eventual demise (1998-2000).

I hope that the extra matches aren't anything you can find on any other DVD! Focusing matches from the WCW Television shows will really give it that feeling of why you can see why WCW was so great and why it fell. I would say that you don't include any high-profile Pay-Per-View matches at all! All these matches can be found on WWE Superstar DVDs (The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, Legends of Wrestling, etc.) and anthology DVDs like The Essential Starrcade.

Grabbing matches from Saturday Night, Power Hour, Main Event, Saturday Morning Pro, World Wide, Nitro, Thunder and Clash of the Champions...would make this DVD a true gem!",1242086400,,936,5.025806451612903
3874964,5,B0028X36EE,"Wow, at last WWE is finally releasing the very best of WCW on DVD with the rise and fall of World Championship Wrestling.

I just hope WWE covers the birth of WCW from when Ted Turner bought the company under Jim Crockett in 1988 to Eric Bischoff as the president who ran WCW to the debut of Nitro, nWo, Goldberg's rise to stardom, Sting, and heaps others.

As much as i love the WWF/E, WCW was my favorite as well for certainly one reason at the time, Bill Goldberg and now the nWo, Sting, Sid Vicious, etc.
Yes, thanks WWE and give you credit for the Monday Night War DVD, nWo, The Best of Starrcade and now Rise & Fall of WCW.

3874987,5,B0028X36EE,"Man, oh man. This brought back some memories for me. I can't remember how many times when I was a young tyke when Sting and Flair were tearing it up, or when I was a teenager constantly switching between WWE and WCW on Monday nights to see the nWo and DX compete on my TV screen. I loved watching about how this company folded, and it was both necessary, but somber at the same time. It was necessary because that place needed an almighty purge by the end of it, but I wish it was just a reset button for them to start over. When WCW died, I hung on to the WWE for a while after that, but by 2004 I realized it was going to be the same, predictable garbage over and over again. So, I tuned out. WCW made WWE great. The competition lit a fire under WWE's ass and made them innovative and great, and vice versa (to a lesser extent on WCW's part). I can only hope one of these small wrestling territories rises up, and eventually becomes a solid #2 that can compete with Vince and his millions to make wrestling exciting again!",1388966400,,1024,4.150753768844221

3874990,4,B0028X36EE,"Overall, I found the set to be very entertaining, and it brought back a lot of great memories of the N.W.A.; Let's just say with all of the hours of N.W.A. footage that could have been shown on the set, it must have been a hard job determining the best content.

Again, maybe a little more about the back story of ""Creative Control"" some wrestlers pushed, would help fans understand why some of the controversy took place, especially behind the scenes, example: Hulk Hogan walking into the (Bash at the Beach?) PPV and demanding the title from Jerrett, therefore executing his creative control clause, which sent Vince Russo over the edge that evening.

Some focus, and or maybe a separate DVD, should be made on the extremly talented group of wrestlers the NWA had. Guys like the Rock n Roll Express, Midnight Express, Fantastics, Dusty, Flair, etc.... deserve a little more than what they got, and by maybe creating a show case of their skills, it may bring a new generation of fans, and or please some of the old school NWA fans.",1380672000,,1032,4.633879781420765

3874997,3,B0028X36EE,"Although not a bad documentary by any means, there is a lot of history simply ignored in this DVD about what killed WCW. The rise was well documented, and really gives a good perspective of the roots of WCW when it first started as NWA.

While there are many reasons WCW died, this DVD only covers a handful of them. The Vince Russo segment was spot on, telling the story of a former WWE writer who came to WCW in hopes of bringing this company back from the dead. Unfortunately, he had Mr. McMahon as a filter when writing for the WWE. When he jumped ship to WCW, the entertainment world saw what Russo looked like unfiltered. A man who felt wrestling worked best backstage rather than in the ring. One who also didn't accept the fact that we all know the show is scripted.

The birth of the NWO was spot on, yet this DVD fails to mention that they helped kill the company just as much as they built it. The fact is, the NWO were bad guys, and the only reason ratings jumped after they debuted was because everyone was dying to see them get what was coming to them. The fact that WCW never got their revenge is what did them under.

David Arquette is highlighted very well here. The former World Heavyweight Champion destroyed any hopes that the company would ever recover.

Now for what is not mentioned...

Sting vs Hogan at Starrcade 1997
A match with over a year in the making. Sting didn't wrestle or even speak that whole year, yet he terrorized the NWO from the rafters and under the ring. When that match finally happened, everyone was waiting to see him KO Hollywood Hogan. That never happened. Instead Hogan dominated pretty much the whole match, then he hit his signature leg drop, and pinned Sting for the three count. Apparently the referee was supposed to do a fast count, except he didn't, and to the whole world it looked like Hogan beat Sting cleanly. Bret Hart knocks out the referee citing a fast count that never happened, restarts the match, and Sting beats Hogan. WCW fans were now introduced to the biggest letdown in the history of the company. This DVD never mentions that.

Fingerpoke of Doom
This is mentioned, although very briefly, which is disappointing considering its ramifications on the entire wrestling world. Hogan and Nash, on the heels of the feuding Hollywood and Wolfpac NWO factions, meet in the ring for the WCW Championship. Hogan pokes Nash in the chest, and Nash falls and lets Hogan take the title from him. This was a vulgar display of backstage power, since Hogan had creative control and Nash was a booker. This one event devalued the WCW Championship, saw two very popular good guys turn heel, killed the very popular NWO Wolfpac, saw the company's only real hero get his butt kicked, and another NWO reunion well after fans got tired of them. The most effective comment about that situation was from Goldberg himself, saying ""That was Hogan and Nash playing their own little games against the wrestling world"".

What is really strange is what this DVD considers the turning point of the Monday Night Wars. It lists the Halloween Havoc blackout as the beginning of the decline. While that sucked, everyone knew is was purely a technical glitch rather than a reflection of the company. Funny how that is mentioned, but nothing about Sting/Hogan.",1353542400,,3295,4.631849315068493

Another fall in the company was the Bret Hart career ending injury, heres 1 of the companys biggest stars in the industry being forced into retirement due to an injury that took place in a WCW ring .. All in all a great Dvd to own all we needed were sum interviews from Sting, Hogan, Nash and Hart but overall a great dvd to own pick 1 up and keep in mint",1342656000,,880,4.182352941176471
3874999,3,B0028X36EE,"Synopsis:  This documentary examines the early successes and failures of Jim Crockett Promotions and how it lead to the modern day incarnation of WCW.  Interviews with the talent willing to talk about the ""good ol days"" also illustrated how a little known third-string announcer by the name of Eric Bischoff turned into one of the most powerful men in wrestling.  The documentary then explores how WCW managed to become a ratings bonanza, only to miraculously fall from grace despite the fact that they had the backing of Ted Turner and his media company.  Interviews are given by a cast that includes Kevin Sullivan, Rick Flair, David and Jim Crockett Jr., Magnum TA, and Goldberg (in addition to canned footage from Eric Bischoff and Scott Hall discussing the demise of WCW as well.)

First off, kudos to the WWE for making sure to bring up the whole history of the WCW in addition to mentioning guys like Magnum TA, who wasn't to be forgotten when mentioning the history of the company.  I liked the first half of the documentary because it did a decent job of showing the roots that they came from and even made certain to reference Black Saturday (when Vince McMahon took over the timeslot previously held by JCP in 1984 on TBS, a move that resulted in a significant backlash against the then-WWF.)  However, while it did touch on some of the valid reasons why it failed, it went to great lengths to state everything but the obvious:  The WCW failed because the storylines and ""top"" competition were the same week after week for 3 years while WCW ""rejects"" like Sunning Steve Austin, Cactus Jack, Jean-Paul Levesque, and ""Mean"" Mark Calloway became part of an all-star cast for the WWE as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind, Triple H, and The Undertaker.  It was like the WWE didn't want to take any credit for the fact their product was absolutely superior at the time.  There weren't any hardballs thrown in Kevin Sullivan's direction for his role in the demise of the company (probably because he was willing to participate in the interview process) and the guy who was responsible for them going down the toilet at the end was... Jeff Jarrett?!  Let's just call a spade a spade and say that his reference towards WCW's ""demise"" had less to do with his role in the company (by the time he jumped ship, the boat was already sunk) and had more to with the fact that he co-founded Impact Wrestling, who's now WWE's main competitor.  There were a lot of things that were true (WCW not knowing how to push/develop talent, Kevin Nash's horrible booking, Vince Russo laying an egg without Vince McMahon) but there were also a fair amount of exaggerations (the tape claims that WCW lost millions when the entire audience couldn't view the ending for the botched 1998 Halloween Havoc show; in actuality, it lost $1.5 Million and about 25% of the viewing audience were affected by the outage.)  Also, because this was a WWE Production, there was absolutely no mention of how poorly Vince McMahon integrated the takeover in the storylines and buried WCW's talent instead of fostering it (with the two most notable exceptions being Eddy Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and The Big Show; all of which defected before the acquisition was official.)

Be that as it may, it was still a darn interesting documentary to watch.  If you want the entire story (not to mention a book that's very hard to put down), go read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Death-of-WCW/dp/1550226614/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Death of WCW</a>&nbsp;for all the facts and coverage that may have been omitted in the documentary.  If you want to view what the takeover was like through WWE-tinted kayfabe glasses, however, then by all means go watch this DVD.  I'd certainly watch it again.",1337040000,,3811,4.9296875

3875001,2,B0028X36EE,"They really dropped the ball on this one. I grew up a NWA / WCW fan. I always thought the WWF/E was to cartoonish but I would watch if it was on. This one starts off good with the history and all, but catapalts over the best years which were the 80 and early to mid 90's. Nothing on Sting, Nikita Koloff, The Stiener Bros, The Varsity Club, The 4 Horsemen, Lex Luger , Barry Windham, Ron Simmons, Road Warriors, the Great Muta, Dusty....NWA/WCW had the best rivalries and title matches. They had Good guys vs Good guys which was unheard of in the WWE until Warrior/Hogan. This leaky ship jumped right into the Monday Night Wars which was significant but focused on who ran WCW more than the wrestlers. It also had a bitter WWE feel to it like the WCW was a shithouse. I do agree the WCW fell hard and deserve to be shutdown because of it non respect for thier suporters during the Vince Russo era. Maybe they should do a best of the NWA video for fans like me.",1333411200,,960,4.2228260869565215

3875007,4,B0028X36EE,"The first, maybe 30 minutes or more is about the very beginning of NWA and some stuff. n my opinion they should have started talking about when WCW (the name)came to existence and go from there. They could have covered alot of areas more had they done that.

I was a huge fan of WCW first ever company to have matches outdoors. They had more lighting and I have never seen the crowd more active and more rowdy than the WCW crowd. My favorite company, I cried when they went down and if you look at WWE today, buying their competition was a big mistake. Competition brings out the best in people. Anyways its an ok dvd, not the best stuff to talk about, the first 40 minutes put me to sleep, but its ok",1300924800,,701,4.192592592592592

I was a Fan Of Goldberg,I was a fan of wcw in the years of 97-98 around then, This is an interesting documentary on it from the start,the founders,players and the WWE connection and finally the WWE(I liked when it was WWF,Hogan,,Savage.and then later the Rock and Stone cold Wrestling sucks now to me)I hate Ted Turner for being a Castro Loving Commie not because he's a Business Man and anything associated with him,the Glory days of wrestling when I grew up In the 80's specifically late 80s to early 90's are sadly gone.",1300579200,,792,4.584507042253521

3875012,3,B0028X36EE,"Not a bad DVD but I feel like it focuses too much on the pre WCW era other than that it's a pretty good dvd including some great matches with Sting, Ricky Steamboat, Vader, DDP etc.",1287878400,,181,4.055555555555555
3875013,3,B0028X36EE,"I agree with a lot of the reviews that have already mentioned how this DVD set is alright but should have been much better. I have Ric Flair and The Four Horsemen as well as Starrcade: The Essential Collection, so I am somewhat doing my review in comparison to those titles.

The Rise and Fall of WCW does well to explain the different people who were in charge of running Mid-Atlantic to the top of the NWA into what became WCW. I think it loses steam as the documentary goes along because you can began to tell where pieces from other DVDs about WCW have been plugged in and where information about certain wrestlers and matches should have been plugged in to help the causal fan understand the connection between the created wrestling story line and the backstage politics that caused momentous changes and mistakes. In comparison, I felt that the other titles mentioned above did a much better job of linking the two.

If you are a fan looking to relive some of the most memorable moments of NWA/WCW, I would not recommend this DVD set and suggest you look into titles about specific wrestlers or title belts because they also fit in a good timeline of where NWA/WCW was at but give a lot more content you are looking for. I was also disappointed in some of the match selections that seemed random instead of being representative of where NWA/WCW was at the time the match took place.",1272758400,,1388,4.548
3875014,4,B0028X36EE,"I am a wrestling fan, and a history fan. I loved the ECW DVD, and growing up in high school, I always gravitated more towards the WCW brand than McMahons. In watching this documentary though, I do agree that it was grossly incomplete. With the multitude of angles left out (The Sting as Crow gimmick), and glossing over numerous other events, it did not live up to the standard that the ECW documentary set.

However, I would like to note that most of the big names that dealt with WCW during that time are either in TNA at the present time (Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Sting, Jeff Jarret, Booker T at the time of it's release), performers that have bad blood with the WWE (Randy Savage, Lex Luger, the Steiners), or are people that the WWE is trying to distance themselves from (Chris Benoit). Someone asked about the Four Horseman reuniting again... Benoit was a big part of that, as well as the Radicalz. So I believe for PR purposes that Vince wanted to downplay the defections as much as possible for those reasons.

Overall, I rate it a 7 out of 10. Not great, but not mediocre. It could've been better, but the true worthwhile stuff lies in the matches. They are hard to beat.",1269388800,,1179,4.453703703703703

3875016,3,B0028X36EE,"I picked up this DVD set because I did enjoy WCW for a brief time in the 1990s, and I'm a Ric Flair fan. Even though the ""history"" part of the documentary could probably be read from various online sources, I thought that there were some interesting parts included that I had never seen or read before. But the matches picked could have been so much better. The Flair/Steamboat match from 1989 is available on many other discs. The Cruiserweight matches were entertaining. But too much of the set, from the documentary to the matches, was a joke.

A wrestling fan and a fan of WCW greats would appreciate ""The Essential Starrcade"" and ""The History of the World Heavyweight Championship"" much more. Better sets and better match selections.",1264982400,,738,4.765625

3875022,3,B0028X36EE,"The recent Rise and Fall of WCW DVD has sparked more controversy than any recent WWE documentary, but is it for good reason?  Well...no.

If anything, this DVD is a victim of drabness.  When I bought this, I was hoping that there would be more talk of the on-camera stories of WCW.  I don't necessarily mean it should be kayfabe, but there are a lot of really good (or at the very least, interesting) storylines from the 1986-1996 period which are almost forgotten today.  Combine that with stories about WCW stars like Rick Rude, Vader, Cactus Jack, and Sid Vicious, who are not always as documented as some of their contemporaries, and there is potential for real excitement.

However, this DVD is 95% behind-the-scenes, as in ""This guy ran WCW, then this guy, than this guy, then this guy, then Vince bought it.  The End.""  This isn't that bad, as we get a lot of great clips along the way and a few moments of insight (I always love to hear from Michael Hayes), but the whole thing feels incomplete.

Additionally, most of the behind-the-scenes stuff lacks juice, as the DVD tries too hard to not put anybody down.  Everybody who ran WCW, from Bill Watts to Jim Herd, are portrayed as meaning well but, gosh, just not working out.  Even Vince Russo is cited as `a real creative guy.""  I realize no human being is perfect, but all of WCW's heads made at least a few huge mistakes,  which are largely glossed over.  For example, the racial controversy surrounding Bill Watts's tenure is included as a deleted scene.  The fact that this story didn't even make the final cut shows the priorities of the DVD.

I can't really fault the makers, as WCW hardcore fans (of which I am not one), probably don't want a DVD that highlights all the times they screwed up, but there is room for debate and discussion, which the documentary does not allow.

As for the extra matches, WWE DVDs these days are more about releasing rarer matches than necessarily the best ones, and I'd be a fool to argue with that.  If you want only 5-star matches, there's probably 5 different DVDs you can find them on.  Generally, I liked about half of them and didn't care much for the other half, my favorites being Rick Rude vs. Sting (I'm a mark for Rick Rude) and Goldberg vs. DDP (Goldberg's best match, IMO).

WCW fans looking for a definitive DVD are likely to be disappointed, those with low expectations should find at least a few things they like.",1256601600,,2429,4.540229885057471
3875023,3,B0028X36EE,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  The 1st disk was good but more should have been added to it.  If Eric Bischoff was interviewed more recently instead of an archive version of him, that would have made it better.  Also they should've touched on the Montreal Screw Job, the Reunification of the 4 Horsemen, Sting vs. Hogan, Starrcade '97 (an average PPV) and more of the people who were accused of holding back the talent and the company (i.e. Nash, Russo, Sullivan, etc.).

Some matches are quite good but thought that there are should have more matches in each of disc. Do you think so?
Anyway, This set is definitely great gift for all WCW fan. It is a legacy!
Because it was done!

I hope that WWE will make the very long await about Sting stuff which I and thought that a lot of fan around the world has been waiting for either, there should be about 4-5 discs, I want to relive with him once in a life time as his first ever match debut, and with Ric Flair for Championship after his leg broken, with Great Muta, wrestler in Japan, duet with Luger era, with Hogan during he still short hair, and many stuff during in n W o's era (I also want to see the long story during he is in black/white character as when he came from top of roof in the ring to blew out all n W o member through when he is in Red/Black wolfpac) against with Goldburg (2-3 times) and especially tag team match with Ultimate Warrior VS Hogan and Bret Hart and definitely with Bret Hart in Halloween 1998, with Vampiro and so on until his last match with Ric Flair.

3875029,4,B0028X36EE,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS IN 2015

They were Pepsi to WWE's Coca-Cola in terms of being the closest competition that the company has ever had in it's entire history to the point where they were the #1 wrestling promotion in wrestling...this is the story of the company that started off as Jim Crockett Promotions but morphed into World Championship Wrestling. Throughout the presentation, you do hear from the usual crop of WWE associates who's had a history with WCW (Vince McMahon, Jim Ross, Michael Hayes, Arn Anderson, Ric Flair, Ron Simmons, Big Show a.k.a. ""The Giant"", Dean Malenko, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Gregory Helms, Mike Graham) but you also hear from those who you don't normally hear from & probably didn't expect to hear from at all (Kevin Sullivan, Jim & David Crockett, Magnum T.A., Bill Watts, Goldberg, and Dr. Harvey Schiller who was the President Of Turner Sports). Now a couple of notes here as well is that the big controversy surrounding the project was that Eric Bischoff chose to not be involved with this project based off WWE's negative showcasing & rewritten history of WCW over the years. WWE fixed that problem as best as they could by using past interview footage taken from other WWE projects (the old ""Confidential"" show & the Monday Night War DVD) & used here to get comments from people like Bischoff along with other names like Hulk Hogan, Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, and Scott Hall. And for those who didn't catch on alright, the two disc of matches are split between the pre & post era's of ""Nitro""

The documentary begins talking about how Jim Crockett Promotions came together along with the birth of Georgia Championship Wrestling and how that was the show that built the cable network we know know as TBS. The politics of the National Wrestling Alliance along with the creative innovations like Starrcade are discussed before into the story of ""Black Saturday"" where Vince McMahon took over the TBS timeslot and the aftermath of that whole deal where David Crockett said, ""we payed for WrestleMania."" The national expansion of JCP along their new talent being brought in (along with the tragic story of Magnum T.A.) are talked about before going into how that backfired on them & caused the sale to Turner. The transformation into WCW with changes behind the scenes along new talent, the in-ring wrestling quality that even made Jim Ross admit they had a better in-ring product than WWE at that time, and the classic feuds that happened during that period (Steamboat/Rude, Sting/Flair, Steamboat/Flair) were heavily talked about. Jim Herd's history with WCW along with the ""revolving door"" of bookers is discussed next before getting into the positives & negatives of what happened during Bill Watts' era of WCW. The introduction of Bill Shaw & the hiring of Eric Bischoff (along the irony behind that after what happened with Bill Watts) is talked about next before going into the steps taken to usher in the new era of WCW like the higher production level and the impact of Hulk Hogan signing with WCW & other ex-WWE personalities coming into the company leading to the birth of WCW Nitro & what Eric Bischoff did to be controversial & make his product different than WCW. The story behind the format of the nWo is heavily discussed next such as where the concept REALLY came from, the lawsuit filed by WWE, Hulk Hogan morphing into Hollywood Hogan, the innovations made to made the nWo look completely different from WCW, and Big Show talking about the details of Hall & Nash's contract which was pretty interesting to hear. The impact of the crusierweight division & Goldberg, how WCW dominated wrestling with their TV ratings/PPV buys were discussed next before going into the influx of celebrities into WCW with DDP telling the story of how the tag matches involving himself, Hogan, Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone, Eric Bischoff & Jay Leno came together and the mixed reactions by other WCW talents to it. The story behind the Goldberg vs. Hogan match on Nitro is heavily discussed next (you won't believe how Goldberg found out about it) before going into the heavy series of mistakes that WCW started to make ranging from what happened at Halloween Havoc '98 to certain wrestlers becoming the booker & being out for themselves to infamous ""Fingerpoke Of Doom"" to the undercard talent starting to leave the company. Incidents during the ""Vince Russo"" era of WCW is talked about such as David Arquette becoming the WCW Champion and the incident at Bash At The Beach '00 with Hulk Hogan and how it was so bad to the point where the talent themselves thought Vince McMahon sent him over to kill off the company...and listen to what Mike Graham had to say about Jeff Jarrett. The story of how the corporate merger of AOL Time Warner led to the end of WCW, WWE buying the company, and the legacy left behind of WCW close out the documentary.

DVD extras include bonus stories such as Dusty Rhodes talking about the ""Cactus Jack Is Missing"" series of videos, Bill Watts talking about the issues of ""racism"" that were put on him during his run of WCW, Bill Goldberg talking about where the elements of his character came from (you'll laugh when you hear how he got his ""Who's Next"" catchphrase), Harvey Schiller talking about a character named ""Spam Man"" which you have to hear to believe, and a piece from the old ""Confidential"" show with Eric Bischoff & Vince McMahon talking giving Eric away the results of RAW on Nitro.

Matches Include:
$1,000 Challenge Match: Magnum T.A. vs. Ric Flair - After a verbal exchange, Magnum offered Flair $1,000 to defeat him in 10 minutes while the Andersons came to ringside to do commentary.  Both men went back & forth early as Flair used his trademark chops & punches in the corner only for Magnum to keep quickly recovering & countering Flair as they continued to trade momentum with reversals & counters working over areas of the body & different using tactics to keep the advantage in their favor.
""NWA World Championship Wrestling"" June ' 85

Sting, Lex Luger, Barry Windham vs. Four Horsemen (Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard) - The babyface team started off hot here singling out one member of the Horsemen working him over individually & as a team constantly staying one step ahead keeping a fresh man in the ring with frequent tags causing the Horsemen to resort to dirty tactics such as illegal moves & objects while taking advantage of the referee while working over a member in & outside of the ring in what was a fun non-stop match.

[Wrestling's Greatest Factions]

NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Dusty Rhodes - Windham had not only recently joined the Horsemen but also captured the U.S. Title that was previously held by Dusty before he was stripped of it leading to this match that the commentators put perfectly as ""Big Brother vs. Little Brother"" as Rhodes was able to stay one step ahead of Barry constantly taking him down & even taking the action to Barry on the concrete floor outside with J.J. Dillion getting involved more than once that didn't always work in his favor before Windham was able to take advantage of a distraction heavily working over Dusty with his claw with Dusty making multiple attempts to escape. I honestly didn't like this match as I felt it was too heavily one sided instead of being more competitive.
NWA Great American Bash '88
[WCW's Greatest Pay Per View Matches Vol. 1]

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat was heavily in control during the opening moments of the match working over his head with a side headlock & constantly going back to it whenever possible while also winning the exchange of chops on more than one occasion resulting in Flair either going or getting knocked to the outside along with using various aerial offense but Flair was able to gain control on the outside using the ringside environment & out-wrestling him in the ring including working over the legs for the figure four, sacrificing himself to hurt Steamboat & taking shortcuts if possible. This was the beginning of a trilogy of matches that year between both men that has gone down as one of the classic rivalries in wrestling based off the technical wrestling along with the simple dynamics of ""good vs. evil"" with both men's natural personalities.

Rock N' Roll Express vs. Midnight Express - One of the greatest rivalries in the history of the promotion revisited once again here as both teams felt each other out early with Rock N' Roll staying one step ahead of Midnight with counters & reversals along with double team maneuvers causing so much frustration with Cornette getting into a confrontation with the referee & Midnight showing dissension between each other before they were able to take advantage of a opening using whatever dirty tactics they could to in & outside of the ring to keep the momentum in their favor.
NWA Wrestle War '90

NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. Southern Boys - The Express attempted some dirty tactics right at the bell only for the Boys to quickly recover with various double teaming offense staying a step ahead including a battle of martial arts at one point before Express used illegal tactics behind the referee & on the outside to get the advantage singling out one of their opponents heavily focusing on an area of the body causing the Boys to use some dirty tactics of their own.
NWA Great American Bash '90

WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. Sting & Lex Luger - Both teams were evenly matched as Luger showcased his power & Sting's agility while using the Steiner's own offense against them while Rick & Scott delivered a wide variety of suplexes as the match got more intense as time went on with each team gaining the advantage by taking advantage of their opponents' mistiming with each team going aerial & having counters to their offense as this ultimately came down to one team taking advantage of one opponent ""taking the bullet"" for his partner.

[Sting: Into The Light]

WCW Champion Sting vs. Vader - It should be noted that Ron Simmons was watching the match with Tony Schavonie from the interview position while Sting came into this match with injured ribs courtesy of Vader months earlier. Vader was dominate early with his offense punching Sting down while easily catching & shoving him off whenever he attempted offense only for Sting to resort to playing Vader's game showcasing some power of his own to take Vader down & keep taking him down as they traded momentum with Vader working over the ribs & Sting continuing to play Vader's power game as it came down to one man capitalizing on another's mans misfortune.
Great American Bash '92
[United We Slam: Best Of The Great American Bash]

WCW International Champion Rick Rude vs. Sting - Before I get started, for those who don't remember the story behind this championship...this was the ""big gold belt"" (currently referred to as the World Heavyweight Championship in WWE) that was originally the NWA Championship but when the NWA pulled out of WCW for the last time, WCW owned the belt and just renamed it but kept the status of it being a World Championship.
Harley Race came out before the match to make a challenge on behalf of Vader to the winner only to try to take a shot at Sting with Rude attempting to capitalize on the distraction only for Sting to dominate both in & outside of the ring before Rude was able to take back control grounding Sting but showed that he was more focus on just beating on Sting than winning the match as they traded momentum in another match in their feud dating back over 2 years but significant for it being their last encounter in WCW as Rude would retire the next month after a career ending injury.
Spring Stampede '94

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Hulk Hogan - Hogan's WCW debut in the dream match against Ric Flair with his old nemesis Sherri in Flair's corner while Jimmy Hart & Mr. T was in Hogan's corner. Hogan kept knocking Flair down early & even did Flair's strut before Flair retailed by grounding Hogan & pulling his hair to keep him down but Hogan kept catching & fighting off Flair's offense resulting in Sherri causing a distraction for Flair to regain control wearing Hogan down as they traded momentum throughout the entire match match before Hogan's leg was targeted by Flair with Sherri getting more physically involved causing an ally of Hogan's to get involved as well. This match lived up to the hype given to it at the time.

[Hulk Still Rules; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Giant - The issues between the Dungeon Of Doom & 4 Horsemen finally boiled over here as Flair's offense had absolutely no effect as Giant didn't even budge but easily dominated Flair with his size & strength causing Flair to resort to his tactics of being the ""dirtiest player in the game"" in a quick match but significant for the elevation of a ""big show.""
""Nitro"" Apr. '96
[Big Show: A Giant's World]

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko - Malenko attacked behind the referee before the bell only for Mysterio to come back with his lucha libre offense from different positions taking Malenko off his feet causing Malenko to attempt to ground Rey as they went through sequences of counters & reversals as Rey continued to deliver his aerial offense only for Malenko to come with one of his own that literally knocked the air right out him in another competitive encounter in their series.
""Clash Of The Champions XXXIII"" Aug. '96

War Games Match: Sting, Lex Luger, Ric Fair, Arn Anderson vs. Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, nWo Sting - This was the first time that the members of each team were to remain backstage instead of ringside along with the first time a referee remained in the ring throughout the entire duration of the match. The big mystery coming into the match was that not only did the nWo have a mystery person as their fourth man while Lex Luger was attacked on the previous Nitro by his fellow teammate Sting leaving it a mystery as to who will replace him. Various highlights include the initial period between Scott Hall & Arn Anderson, Luger showcasing his power including picking up & ramming Hall into the cage, the nWo's constant numbers advantage, Flair showing why he's the ""dirtiest player in the game"", a blooper with Nash & the camera man if you pay close attention, and who the final members of each team were. This was one of the most infamous matches in not only the history of not only War Games but WCW as this match began a bunch of changes from how the nWo was throughout the rest of their time in WCW along with the beginning of the transformation of one of their biggest stars.
Fall Brawl '96
[nWo: Back In Black; War Games: WCW's Most Dangerous Matches]

Ladder Match: WCW United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Syxx - I believe this was the first ladder match on WCW television (if not in the history of the company) as Syxx resorted on his martial arts with various kicks & going for high risk off maneuvers while Eddie relied on his lucha libre offense such as head scissors & top rope moves himself before the ladder came into play in various ways from being used as a weapon to throw onto & into your opponent, dropkick it into your opponent on the top rope & a leaping side kick off the top of the ladder onto his opponent on the other side of the ladder as both men tried hard but something wasn't clicking here (including the botched ending) to the point where Eddie has gone on record saying that this match, ""wasn't very good.""
nWo Souled Out '97
[The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

No Disqualification Match: WCW United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko - These men fought various times before throughout their entire careers before WCW but this was more personal than it was before as they showcased more aggression right from the start with both men stomping each other down in the corner & trash talking each other with Eddie having Malenko in a headlock giving repeated punches to the face or Malenko using the championship as a weapon as both men got more & more physical delivering moves directly to a sensitive part of the body using whatever area of the ring & outside possible just to inflict more punishment while implying different submissions with them just continuing to beat on each other to the point where both used tactics that under any other circumstances would have been illegal along with one moment where one opponent pulled up the other off a pin attempt just to beat on him as this was without a doubt the most physical & aggressive match these two have had against each other with the only negative is how the focus got off the match at times due to a backstage incident.
Uncensored '97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Juventud must either win the championship or lose his mask as Jericho showed that he was heavily overconfident early allowing Juvi to execute a heavy series of offense from the springboard position along with other lucha libre influenced offense causing Jericho to attempt different tactics from his championship advantage to eventually getting more aggressive as they traded momentum with both taking it to the air along with impactful in-ring offense & countering their opponents offense into their own as this was a very impactful match that came down to one man being able to catch the other.
SuperBrawl VIII '98
[Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]

WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. Outsiders - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as the match went less than 5 minutes & was all about the birth of ""Big Poppa Pump"" Scott Steiner & the end of the Steiner Brothers (for that time).

Diamond Dallas Page & Karl Malone vs. Hollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman - The Disciple was in nWo Hollywood's corner as Malone & DDP took control early with both men showing up their opponents at one point only for Rodman to attempt to do the same only to embarrass himself losing his balance on more than one occasion including falling into a cameraman causing him & Hogan to use dirty tactics from the illegal man on the apron getting involved to taking advantage of where the referee was to gain the advantage relying on double teaming & singling out one member of the opposing team to retain it before Malone & DDP came back not only using some of the nWo's only offense against them but also things starting to get so out of control that it was more than just the legal participants who were left laying.  This was one of those matches that was strictly about WCW getting the media attention from having celebrities involved in the company but wasn't much quality wise as Rodman clearly was in no physical condition to be involved in his match as he was more focused on keeping his bandana on more than anything else which was a major step down from his tag match a year earlier while Malone made a decent effort but it wasn't enough to where the actual wrestling fans were chanting ""boring"" at one point.
Bash At The Beach '98

WCW Champion Goldberg vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This match started off very aggressive with Goldberg shoving Page into the corner with Page responding with an armdrag before both men locked up with such intensity that they ended up pushing each other to the outside as they traded momentum back & forth in the ring from DDP's leg sweep takedowns to Goldberg applying the cross armbreaker with DDP responding in a jaw breaker while Goldberg came back shoving him to the floor during an attempt at the Diamond Cutter. DDP attempted to ground him with a front facelock only for Goldberg to use his power for various slams with DDP responding with a head scissors takedown & flying clothesline while also avoiding the spear causing Goldberg to hurt his shoulder but still fought with one arm including a slam & the spear as they continued to trade counters from the Jackhammer into the Diamond Cutter & a suplex into the Jackhammer. This was possibly Goldberg's best match in WCW strictly from an in-ring wrestling standpoint as DDP brought out a more physical side of Goldberg in the ring than anyone before him to the point where this match was named Match Of The Year by WCW Magazine that year.
Halloween Havoc '98
[Goldberg: The Ultimate Collection; WCW's Greatest Pay Per View Matches Vol. 1]

WCW Champion Booker T vs. Lance Storm - It was during this time that Lance Storm already held all of the singles championships except for the one that he was challenging Booker T for in this match while Mike Awesome was on commentary with his ""girlfriend"" Heidi eating a tray of ham sandwiches.  The action went back & forth early with Storm showcasing his athleticism focusing on Booker's injured leg while Booker used his strength on both offense & defense with each man being able to catch their opponent at one point with one man ultimately catching his opponent to the point where they couldn't get up with an aftermath that caused one man to make more enemies with his lack of respect shown towards more than one person.
""Nitro"" Aug. '00
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 1]

As usual with every DVD, there are some positives & negatives. The big negative here is that the documentary seemed to go through all the post-Nitro era of the company too quickly for me (you went from the birth of Jim Crockett Promotions to the nWo before the first hour was up) ignoring such details as the expansion & merging with various promotions like the Universal Wrestling Federation, Clash Of The Champions going head up against WrestleMania IV, controversial ending of Starrcade '97 with Hogan vs. Sting, how the nWo got so big that there were more stars in that group than in WCW, and the issue of racism that was always apparent in WCW's history just to name a few.  The positives were that everyone will have their own list of what should be on the WCW, they did a nice job in giving us quality matches overall (although I could have did without the Outsiders/Steiners & Booker/Storm match) and not a lot of repeats at the time this set was released. The major positive for me that overshadows that is the fact that after seeing the negative image WWE gave out on WCW in the past...they did what they did on the Starrcade DVD and give a fair view on the company & kept it away from being a burial like how we've gotten before.

Overall, this isn't on the level of how the documentaries of ECW & World Class were but it was better than ""Monday Night War"" so this is something I would recommend as a ""starting point"" to learn the history about WCW.",1252281600,3,22854,4.690850162054351
3875030,3,B0028X36EE,"I'll be honest, there are things in terms of content and matches that WWE could've done better on this set but in their defense on the documentary, a lot of key figures (including Ted Turner, Eric Bischoff and Brad Seagal) declined to be part of this project so their abscence did hurt it a bit. Still, it isn't as bad as some of the other reviews both on Amazon and on other sites have claimed it to be though I will agree it could've been better, especially on some of the match selections! Here is what you'll find on here starting with the chapters:

Jim Crockett Promotions
Georgia Championship Wrestling
Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling
Black Saturday
The Expansion
Crockett Sells to Turner
Greatest Talent in the World
New Management
Bill Watts Era
Bill Shaw Hires Eric Bischoff
Hulk Hogan Arrives
Nitro Debuts
nWo

Legacy of WCW

I have to say that the most interesting parts were the history of Jim Crockett Promotions, Black Saturday (in reference to when Vince McMahon temporarily took over the Georgia Championship Wrestling show in 1985) and thru the Bill Watts era. Where it gets muddled a bit is when discussing Bischoff, Russo and the nWo angle. Surprisingly, many take up for Bischoff though they ultimately admit he was one of the reasons for its downfall! Still, its is an interesting take on what happened.

Some history is left out which has already been discussed on other DVD's such as The Four Horsemen, The Road Warriors, the backstage controversy between Chris Benoit and Kevin Sullivan, the misuse of Bret ""Hitman"" Hart, and the departure of Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn. Some history has never been touched such as the botched ending at Starrcade '97 (which I believe was the real beginning of the end of WCW) or the mophing of Sting into what we know him now.

Now granted, I understand why Benoit isn't mentioned but the Radicalz departure was a key blow to WCW talent-wise and could've been done without mentioning his name and on that one, showing him would've been completely understandable as they have done it in recent months (see Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection).

Bonus features:

* Lost in Cleveland (Cactus Jack vignette) - This took place during Cactus' short but memorable program with then-WCW Champion Vader in 1993. Dusty Rhodes disuccess this vignette.

* Bill Watts Defends Himself - Bill Watts answers the critics for his no-nonsense style and the accusations that have dogged him for years, particualy charges of racism. While I have been aware of the stories of Mr. Watts, he raises some good counterpoints.

* Spam Man - This one is explained by Dr. Harvey Shiller. Worth one look.

* The Origin of Goldberg - Nice to see Goldberg again as he discusses his journey into the phenom he was in WCW. He even discusses the rumor that he was made as a counter to ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (who was WWE's biggest star at that point).

* Bischoff Gives Away RAW Results - Bischoff (by way of a past interview) explains why he did that and even discusses the night that he had announcer Tony Schivone give away that Mick Foley was going to win the then-WWF title that night against The Rock (which was a BIG backfire in my view)!

Now, for the matches:

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. Magnum T.A. ($10,000 Challenge Match) - Classic stuff here and the true beginning (in my view) of The Four Horsemen! This one should've been on Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen BUT I am glad to see it again after all these years!

Sting, Lex Luger & Barry Windham vs. Ric Flair, Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard (w/ JJ Dillon) - Not a bad six-man as this took place shortly after the first Clash Of Championships where Luger & Windham took the NWA World Tag Team Titles from Blanchard and Anderson and Sting had that legendary 45 minute draw with Flair.

""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes Vs. Barry Windham (NWA U.S. Title Match) - This was at the 1988 Great American Bash. In terms of today's wrestling, this match doesn't hold up well but it was good for its time. Ending is a classic ""Dusty finish.""

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat (NWA World Title Match) - This one was the first of three classic bouts from 1989 at Chi-Town Rumble '89. No words I can say can do this match justice! This one is a must see! To be a little street for a second, Flair/Steamboat in 1989 was the s***!

The Rock `n' Roll Express vs. The Midnight Express - Let me say that this match is a classic tag team encounter! A lot of reviewers slam it but I actually thought it was pretty good. I saw some older bouts between the teams that were better BUT this is a good match if you've never seen a Rock n Roll Vs. Midnight match!

The Midnight Express Vs. The Southern Boys (NWA U.S. Tag Team Title Match) - This is what I would call a ""lost classic."" The Midnights were legendary but the team of Tracy Smothers and Steve Armstrong were great in their own right!

The Steiner Brothers Vs. Sting & Lex Luger (WCW World Tag Team Title Match) - This began as a jog but quickly turned into a sprint! One of the definitions of a ""high spot"" match! In an era when Rick and Scott were nearly unbeatable, Sting and Lex Luger took them to their limits. A must see.

Sting Vs. Big Van Vader (WCW World Title Match) - Their first PPV face-off and it was a good one! I don't recall these two ever having a match that sucked!

""Ravishing"" Rick Rude Vs. Sting (WCW International Title Match) - Here is another one that Sting had good bouts with and that was the late Rick Rude. Personally, while this is a good match, I would've rathered seen Rick Rude Vs. Steamboat in their underrated 30 minute Iron-Man match (which preceeded Shawn Michaels Vs. Bret Hart in terms of a marathon bout like that being done on PPV by 4 years). Still, its worth a look.

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. Hulk Hogan (WCW World Title Match) - Their first one on one meeting on PPV! Not the greatest match but it doesn't suck. Much like Rock/Hogan at WrestleMania X8 and Warrior/Hogan at WrestleMania 6, the crowd made this match!

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair Vs. The Giant (The Big Show)(WCW World Title Match) - This is only significant because TBS wins his first World title here. These two have had better matches against each other. Also, we see the late Nancy Benoit and the late Ms. Elizabeth too.

Rey Mysterio, Jr. Vs. Dean Malenko (WCW Cruiserweight Title Match) - Another pair that rarely had a match that sucked!

War Games Match
Sting, Lex Luger, Ric Fair & Arn Anderson vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall & a Mystery Partner - I personally would've rather had seen the original WarGames bout or (and I know this wouldn't happen because Benoit was involved) the 1997 version when The Four Horsemen of Flair, McMichael, Benoit and Hennig took on nWo members ""Buff"" Bagwell, Konnan, Syxx and Kevin Nash. Both of those were better overall WarGames than the one picked. Its only good for historical reasons because it shows the dominance of the nWo and the beginnings of the transformation of Sting.

Syxx Vs. Eddie Guerrero (WCW U.S. Title Ladder Match) - I remember Eddie Guerrero saying on ""Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story"" that he felt this match wasn't quite what he wanted. I thought it was pretty good on its own but when you compare it to Eddie's WWE bouts with Rob Van Damn and Rey Mysterio, it does seem to be rather weak!

Still, this is a good one to peep. The intro of Eddie on this ""nWo"" PPV was rather funny!

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Dean Malenko (WCW United States Title Match) - In my view, this one was the BEST WCW encounter they ever had! Making it No DQ gave them lattitude that they used very well. While still falls short of their ECW encounters, this one comes very close to matching those.

Chris Jericho Vs. Juventud Guerrera (WCW Cruiserweight Title Match) - You see flashes of the Jericho we know now in this classic! The cruiserweights were the bomb in WCW and this match was a great example of it.

The Steiner Brothers Vs. The Outsiders (WCW World Tag Team Title Match) - Not really a match as it was used to set up Scott Steiners turn to the nWo and his transformation into ""Big Poppa Pump."" Not much in the match department.

Diamond Dallas Page & Karl Malone Vs. Hulk Hogan & Dennis Rodman - Only good for entertainment. Don't expect a classic here!

Goldberg Vs. Diamond Dallas Page (WCW World Title Match) - One of his best title defenses as DDP really worked well with Goldberg. This is also the infamous match that got cut off at the PPV time at Halloween Havoc '98! Fortunately, we get to see the whole match.

Booker T. Vs. Lance Storm (WCW World Title Match) - Nothing against Booker or Lance but this bout really didn't need to be here! It isn't even one of their best matches. It does, however, give you an idea of how bad WCW had fallen by that time! View just to get that perspective.

Overall, this product is a 3 1/2 star DVD set. Not the worst I've ever seen but falls short of ones like ""Triumph & Tragedy Of World Class Championship Wrestling"" or ""The Spectacular Legacy Of The AWA."" It definitely pales compared to ""The Rise & Fall Of ECW!"" Worth a buy but I would try to find it at a lower price!",1252281600,19,9332,4.542312276519667
3875031,4,B0028X36EE,"The documentary was good, but the fact is they used a combination of past and current interviews. If people like Eric Bischoff, Bill Shaw, Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger, and a couple others participated, this would have been a better documentary. Whoever put this together really did not do a great job.

Now, as for the matches, it's a sweet list. Flair/Steamboat tops the list with a classic encounter between Magnum TA and Flair, along with a couple good tag bouts. They could have included another (or a different) War Games match and maybe some different matches that were more newsworthy.

Overall, the disc set is good. Most of the stars are for the matches, though.",1252195200,,696,4.791666666666667
3875032,3,B0028X36EE,"It's not a bad documentary for what it is and what they actually mention.  Some decent matches I'd like to say.  But talk about a Cliff's Notes version of the history and what all went down in WCW.  Words can't describe how let down I really was.  It made me want to go back and read ""The Death of WCW"" again.  You'll REALLY get the unfiltered, more unbiased version of what went down at least in the final 5 or 6 years of WCW, warts and all.",1251936000,,442,4.0344827586206895
3875033,3,B0028X36EE,"Okay let me start of by saying that this DVD starts off very good with describing the territories and the different owners who ran WCW at one time.

There was no mention of Bret Hart, Ric Flair as The Black Scorpion, Harlem Heat, The Road Warriors, The Great Muta, The Steiners, Vader, Sid Vicious, The New Blood (Vampiro, Billy Kidman, Buff Bagwell, etc.)

These are the reasons for the downfall of WCW:

1) Bringing in too many former WWF wrestlers such as Curt Henning, The Million Dollar Man, Randy Savage, The Big Boss Man, Rick Rude, Brutus Beefcake, Rowdy Piper, The Ultimate Warrior, etc and not using them effectively.

2) The NWO storyline overshadowed other wrestlers.

3) Guaranteed contracts which led to lackluster performance.

4) Putting Goldberg over too quickly. Goldberg's whole gimmick was that he could not be beaten so once he was, there was no reason to watch him anymore.

5) Too many gimmick wrestlers such as Glacier, Mortis, The Shockmaster, The Yetti, etc.",1251849600,2,984,4.891566265060241
3875034,2,B0028X36EE,"WWE took the shortcut on this DVD by using a ton of old interviews from The Monday Night Wars DVD and the nWo DVD, among others. While there are new interviews from people such as Kevin Sullivan, Harvey Schiller, Bill Watts, etc. it comes off rushed and recycled and was a major let down. Those that know a lot about wrestling history know a ton of important facts were left out of this DVD. This might be the worst Documentary that WWE has ever done. It was a major let down in my opinion and I would rather see some sort of indie documentary about the rise and fall of WCW, similar to ""The Heroes of World Class"" where actual research is done and more people are interviewed with less fluff, while being more in depth. This was such a MAJOR let down.",1251590400,5,752,4.265734265734266
3875035,4,B0028X36EE,"Once again it should be no surprise that the negativity is in full gear on this site like it is everywhere else on the internet. If you believe everything you read here, you probably should not bother buying this set at all. While you shouldn't believe everything you read here, some of the reviews have valid points.

The ironic thing is that while the documentary is lacking in a few areas, it's the matches that suffer on this set. I enjoyed the hour and 45 minute history lesson WWE presented, especially the opening and closing video montages. I was really pleased they managed to get Jim Crockett Jr. to participate. Another pleasant surprise was that they apparently used somebody's video collection for the footage used from the early days of Mid Atlantic and Georgia Championship Wrestling (I guess the rumors that the master tapes have long been destroyed or thrown away are true). This enhanced the documentary in my opinion in an artful way, giving it a ""nostalgic"" character. If you own the Ric Flair Legend bootleg collection you'll recognize the footage of Ric Flair's interview with Gordon Solie after he won his first NWA title. I agree that the Crockett brothers tale of the origins of WCW are the best part of the doc. Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes add their own comments throughout, as well as Ricky Steamboat and Magnum TA (Magnum's comments are mostly form the Starrcade doc).

As far as the story of WCW from 1988 on, it was hurt by the aspect that many key players refused to do interviews for this project i.e. Ted Turner, Jim Herd, Hogan, Bischoff, etc. Also how can you not have Sting, Lex Luger, Tully Blanchard, JJ Dillon and Steve Austin not featured here? It might have been worth the wait until Sting retired to get his input on this project. WWE does the best they can through these chapters with stock footage of past interviews and cover many key things. Starrcade, the Flair/Herd and Flair/Bischoff stories have been covered more than once on other discs, as well as the Four Horsemen story (with Sid/Arn incident). When they discuss Ole's booking they (Michael Hayes and Teddy Long) make good points, but how could you not mention the Black Scorpion and the Shockmaster to illustrate what everybody had to say? Bill Watts' was covered fair, but his denial that Hank Aaron didn't get him fired clashed with reputable sources that say he did.

The NWO/Nitro years are covered as good as can be with the time they have to present this story (with the budgets these days we were lucky to get the time we did). Again however, lots of stock interviews. They did at least get Kevin Sullivan to add his insight. It was ironic to see how Dean Malenko complained that he left due to the glass ceiling, but not mention Kevin Sullivan being the key culprit in his departure (along with Benoit, Saturn and Eddie Guerrero).

The ""Deathbed Years (1999-2001)"" were rushed. Vince Russo is discussed, but many of his bad angles aren't. Brett Hart's misuse isn't discussed and neither is his career ending injury at the hands of Goldberg (who gives various comments throughout the doc). I wonder if this was due to Goldberg's participation and fear he would be offended if this was covered. Oh well, again, time constraints probably hampered this portion also.

Lastly I think if they had just waited until they finally managed to get most or everybody on board, and did a full disc 3 hour documentary, this could have had the potential to be the best release to date. Instead it ends up being a fun look back, with a synopsis of what happened touching on the highlights. It's good for what it is I say.

On the matches I think non-fans of the business must have picked these. There's a whole myriad of matches they could have picked that haven't been shown and they chose to just pick average matches. I'm not going to talk about all of them, but the ones I liked were the Magnum/Flair $1000 challenge, Dusty vs. Barry Windham, Flair vs. Steamboat (at least it had Flair's entrance this time) Flair vs. the Giant 1996 and DDP vs. Goldberg. I can't believe that with all the classic RNR Express vs. Midnight Express classics they picked a match from 1990 with poorly dubbed techno music over their original entrance themes. If I recall, WCW used in-house generic themes at the time, so why couldn't they just leave it as is? Here's an alternative list for you: How about the RNR Express vs. the Koloffs from Starrcade '85? Tully Blanchard vs. Dusty Rhodes from MACW March 1986? Dusty vs. Tully $100,000 challenge June 1987? Magnum TA vs. Nikita Koloff last match of 7 for the US Title? The Midnight Express vs. Flair and Barry Windham from COC 1988? The original War Games match (a huge deal for JCP at the time)? Flair vs. Jimmy Garvin from GAB '87? Flair vs. Luger from GAB 88? Black Scorpion (Flair) vs. Sting from Starrcade '90? Flair vs. Sting from GAB '90? Vader vs Nikita Koloff (ending Koloff's career)? The WCW title match from Starrcade '95 featuring Sting, Luger, Flair and Randy Savage? The formation of the NWO from BATB '96? The NWO parking lot attack on Nitro? Goldberg vs Hogan from Nitro? War Games '97 with Curt Hennig's heel turn to the NWO? At this point, you get the picture I'm sure. In the future I wish WWE would get more fan input when it comes to match selections for these sets.

It's still my opinion the folks in WWE producing and making these sets put a lot of work and pride in these. I just think for this one the sky should have been the limit and a write-in ballot should have been issued for the match selection. Final verdict here is that it's worth buying, but it will be a like a meal at some expensive restaurants. Great presentation, but you're still hungry!",1251504000,2,5713,4.622660098522167
3875036,2,B0028X36EE,"I went out to get this DVD the day it came out because I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was anticipating the documentary part more than the matches. You can get one of those WWEClassics subscriptions and get access to MUCH better matches than this DVD set had.

The documentary portion was a disappointment. A big one.

They spent too much time on how WCW came to be, and not enough time on what WCW was when it was at its highpoint and how bad it was when it died. It's almost like they forgot to include more than five minutes of coverage for 1999-2001. They could've covered nWo Wolfpac vs nWo Hollywood, Raven's Flock, Millionaire's Club/New Blood feud, some of WCW's crazy endings that made NO sense. Instead, they covered Goldberg, Hogan, and the NWO... stuff we've seen to death.

Their Monday Night War DVD was much better.",1251504000,5,843,4.532894736842105

Thank god that WWE went back to the full documentary and then the bonus matches instead of a few minutes of comments and then a match. This DVD set really illustrates the history of NWA/WCW from the beginning. Flair and the 4 Horseman...Magnum TA, Sting, Dusty, Rock N Roll...up to the NWO, Hogan, Savage, Lugar, Eddie, Rey, Dean, and all the Cruisers. The beginning of Y2J, Big Show, and everyone thats big in WWE right now. The only draw back is nothing on Benoit or Road Warriors, or Austin.(my favorite wrestlers) The doc is good. The matches are awesome. Could have added more old school WCW/NWA matches.(Wargames with the 4 horseman and Road Warriors, Starcade)Good buy for any hard core wrestling fan.",1251417600,,883,5.01360544217687
3875038,1,B0028X36EE,"This DVD is not what I expected at all. In fact, the Monday Night Wars DVD was so much more in depth and better produced, and it is half the length. I wish that this DVD would have been three DVD""s of just documentary. Keep the matches, they aren't very good anyway. The fact of the matter, is that the WWE produced and distributed this DVD, so they have no intention of pointing any fingers at themselves.

The beginning of this documentary was well done, with  Jim Crocket and David Crocket talking about their father and the taking over of the business, but after that, it completey takes a left turn.

This is zero mention of how Vince Jr wanted to take over the WHOLE wrestling industry in the early 80's and was intent on moving into other territories ironically enough against his own father's wishes, which caused so many wrestling factions to shut down when Vince stole his talent and moved into their territories.

Nor does it talk about how Vince Jr told the cable operators that if they showed Starrcade '87 instead of the intial Survivor Series that he would ban them from having any rights from airing Wrestlemania VI the following year, which in effect caused massive losses from pay-per view and box office receipts. This indirectly led to JCP having to sell to Ted Turner who appointed people that had zero knowledge of wrestling or promoting it.

Nor does the DVD talk about how close the WWE was to bankruptcy in 96 with 6 million in losses.  You see, the people at WWE that produce these DVD's have a warped sense of reality and short memory. They are very biased to make the WWE look like they were honest and had intergrity, when in actuality it is just the opposite. And you know what? That is fine. It is business. It happens everyday and nobody can fault the WWE for trying to put its competitors out of business. However, be truthful about it and tell it how it is. There is no shame in it, but when you cover it up and act like it never happened, it creates a lot of mistrust in those telling the story.

The reality is, that the WCW killed itself. Everyone is accountable and they all had a hand in the demise of WCW. Jim Crockett with his lavish spending habits and territorial miscalculations; Jim Herd who had ZERO understanding of the wrestling business; Bill Watts who was past his prime and ran the WCW like it wa stuck in the 70's & 80's; Ole Anderson & Dusty Rhodes who ridculous storylines, bad booking, and putting over their friends; Eric Bishoff who got drunk with power, wasted millions on celebraties who brought very little to the party, and had no faith in anyone besides Kevin Nash & Hulk Hogan who had creative control and headlined EVERY PPV; and especially Vince Russo whose moronic ideas lost the company $62 million in one year!!!  The fact is, the booking and storylines in the 98, 99, and 2000 were the end of WCW, because they let major personalities go over to the WWE and flourish while playing the same song over and over.

When Ted Turner sold his equity in Time Warner and had no power anymore that was effectively the end of WCW, because he loved wrestling and would never let it die, but Vince JR wants you to think that HE destroyed WCW on his own. NONSENSE!",1251331200,18,3219,4.479522184300341
3875039,3,B0028X36EE,"This DVD set is good, but it looks oddly familiar.  If you have seen the Starrcade DVD set, you have basically seen half of the first disc.  If you have seen The Monday Night War DVD, you have seen the other half of the first DVD.  To be fair, there is a little more than what can be found on other DVDs, like the time when WCW went off the air before a pay-per-view was over and a young Vince McMahon announcing for WCW.

Most of the interviews, with the exception of Goldberg's took place in 2002/2003.  I found the Goldberg interview extra to be a nice feature, but the extras and matches seem quite thin.  The included matches don't portray WCW at its height very well.

I have watched WCW and WWF/WWE since the early 80s.  I can tell you there is a lot of the late history of WCW missing in this set.  For example, Bret Hart can be found in only one scene.  The Horsemen get a mention here or there.  Thursday Thunder gets a brief mention.  While the nWo is covered, there's nothing about the different nWo factions (black, red, latino).  There's also no real sense of the chaos the original nWo caused.  What about all the heel turns made by various wrestlers when they joined the nWo?  It just isn't covered.  One more thing...The Ultimate Warrior and his on again-off again behavior is missing from the DVD.

The video/music package at the end of Disc One was artfully done, and is probably the highlight of the first disc.

Overall, I had huge expectations for this DVD set.  I was hoping it would recapture the glory of WCW and then reveal some juicy details about its fall.  The DVD set falls short on both.  If you want the real story, Eric Bischoff's book does a better job at telling the rise and fall of WCW.",1251331200,3,1723,4.338557993730408
3875040,4,B0028X36EE,"Let's clear a few thing up. The only thing wrong about this documentary is that the WWE produced it with the assumption that either the viewer already knows about some of the WCW story or have seen thier past DVD's. When you read reviews on this board about what they left out, it's because either they have no knowlage of what happened with WCW or they have never seen other WWE DVD's that have already covered the ""missing"" subject to death. Here's a few examples:

Why was Biscoff let go, Russo brought in, Biscoff brought back, and Turner sold to Time Warner? See the ""Monday Night War"" DVD.Also you might wanna read ""Controversy Creates Cash"" by Eric Biscoff.

WCW's raid on ECW? See the ""Monday Night War"", ""The Rise And Fall Of ECW"" DVD's.

Bret Hart? See, again ""Monday Night War"" and Bret Hart's DVD Set.

What is here is a decent representation of where WCW came from and some views of why it epicly failed, by some of those who were there, been there, and in the business at the time.

The match listing is worthy of a 6th star if it were possible, 10 stars if you by this with the ""Starrcade"" DVD.

The only 2 weaknesses that this DVD set has is that, as said before, it was produce with the assuption that you have seen past WWE DVD's and that It wasn't produced with the same passion that the ""Rise and fall of ECW"" was. But, considering that when ECW was produced, WWE had a majority of thier talent and owner under contract. Not the case with WCW.

I just hope Jim Crockett Jr. and Sting (currently, in the retirement phase in TNA)will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

I recomment that if you buy this, get the ""Monday Night War"" DVD with it and watch it first. If you already have seen it, then I recommend the ""Starrcade"", ""Rick Flair and the 4 Horsemen"", ""The Ultimate Rick Flair Collection"", ""Bret Hart: The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be"", ""The Rise and fall of ECW"" DVD's as a companion to this set. But if you don't really want to invest that much into it, the ""Contoversy Creates Cash"" and ""The death of WCW"" books will shed a great amount of light on the subjects that isn't covered in this DVD.",1251331200,3,2162,4.334158415841584
3875041,3,B0028X36EE,"After reading some of these reviews and watching the DVD myself I have to strongly agree with the majority in the feeling that there is alot missing on the documentary portion of the DVD. I expected it to be alot like ""the Rise & Fall of ECW"" where they basically covered all the important things that went down in ECW. I understand how some things are left out due to already being covered on other DVDs, like the Horseman, nWo, the Monday night wars, the rise of ric flair). Then there's the stuff they left out that I don't understand like Sting, Lex Luger, The Steiners, very little DDP, Ron Simmons becoming the first black World Heavyweight champion, the dungeon of doom and The Giant, and they didn't really cover the guys that left there to goto WWE.

Onto the matches which are the Highlight of the dvd. you get some real classics on here, (Flair Vs. Steamboat, Midnight Express Vs. Rock N' Roll Express, Vader Vs. Sting, and Eddie Vs. Syxx. All in all there really isn't a bad match on here my only complaint is I would have preferred another match over flair Vs. Hogan at Bash 94 (maybe Rude Vs. Steamboat - Ironman from Bash 92, or Simmons Vs. Vader).

So, is it worth picking up yes just don't have high hopes for the doc.",1251331200,4,1235,4.412280701754386
3875042,5,B0028X36EE,"The Rise and Fall of WCW is one of the most anticipated DVD's that the WWE has ever put out, but does it truly live up to the plethora of hype?

We will begin with Disc 1- the documentary. Some of the review's already up have provided valid points that cover why they dislike the documentary. However, I personally really enjoyed it. For the most part, they were not biased by any means (the only people they were biased towards were the ones that are currently under contract for TNA, i.e. Jeff Jarrett, and Kevin Nash). It really covered a vast array of events, and definatly made WCW look good. For those of you die-hard WCW fans that are concerned that this trashes the legacy of at one time, the biggest wrestling promotion in America, rest assured; the documentary is very fair. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as it was descriptive, interesting, and lengthy as well (it was about 2 hours, I believe). There are a TON of people that were interviewed, from Eric Bischoff, Kevin Sullivan, Dean Malenko, and Arn Anderson, to even Hulk Hogan, and Scott Hall. The documentary, while it has it's faults, is overall very entertaining.

Now, onto the matches themselves:

The matches chosen for both Discs 2, and 3, were very good, for the most part. Every single match on the set was truly great (with the exception of a very few), and different from the previous one. You had phenomenal one-on-one encounters, such as Steamboat/Flair I, great specialty matches, like Syxx/Eddie Guerrero, and truly amazing tag team battles, like The Midnight Express, and The Southern Boys. If you haven't seen any of the matches, they are HIGHLY recommended. Here is a match by match star ratings list (in my opinion):

Disc 2
-Ric Flair VS Magnum T.A.- ***1/2
-Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Tully Blanchard VS Sting, Barry Windham, and Lex Luger- ***3/4
-Barry Windham VS Dusty Rhodes- ** (Very Disappointing Finish)
-Ric Flair VS Ricky Steamboat- ***** (And I don't give those away too often!)
-The Midnight Express VS The Rock 'n Roll Express- ****
-The Midnight Express VS The Southern Boys- ****1/2
-The Steiner Brothers VS Sting and Lex Luger- ****1/4
-Sting VS Big Van Vader- ****1/4 (Both men tore the house down)
-Rick Rude VS Sting- *** (A very odd choice to be on the set. This was Rude's last U.S. PPV appearance, as he would suffer a career ending injury in Japan about a month later.)
-Ric Flair VS Hulk Hogan- *** (Not as good as it looks on paper, if you haven't seen this match.)

Disc 3
-Ric Flair VS The Giant- N/A (Haven't watched it yet!)
-Rey Mysterio, Jr. VS Dean Malenko- ****1/4
- War Games Match (Fall Brawl 1996)- **** (Not the best War Games match by any means, but to say it lacked drama would be a lie.)
-Syxx VS Eddie Guerrero- ***3/4
-Eddie Guerrero VS Dean Malenk- ****1/4 (Man, did these two have some classic battles!)
-Chris Jericho VS Juventud Guerrera- ****
-The Steiner Brothers VS The Outsiders- ***
- DDP and Karl Malone VS Hulk Hogan and Dennis Rodman- **
- Goldberg VS DDP- ***1/4
-Booker T VS Lance Storm- ***1/2

Overall, as I've said before, this was a great DVD set. It presents a very fair documentary, and a list of some truly phenomenal matches. The Rise and Fall of WCW is highly recommended for the WCW fan, or for a newer fan looking to relive the good 'ol days. Thanks for reading.",1251244800,3,3311,4.612903225806452
3875043,5,B0028X36EE,"For someone who followed NWA/WCW through the years, this is a great look back at the greatest memories of wrestlings past! For someone who wasn't watching, or didn't follow them... THIS IS A MUST HAVE!

I must recommend the Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair match... This one was probally one of the best matches in wrestling history. Steamboat vs. Flair blows away Steamboat vs. Savage.

Enjoy this DVD!!!!",1251244800,,403,4.911764705882353
3875044,3,B0028X36EE,"I haven't bought the dvd,  but thanks to the power of the internet i was still able to catch the documentary portion of this, when i first heard wwe was producing a dvd on the fall of wcw  and heard that they weren't speakign to hogan, or bischoff  and that ted turner pretty much turned down an offer to be interviewed i wasn't expecting the best. with russo, sting, booker and nash still signed to tna  i figured they were only going to speak with ex-wcw talent who are still working for vince and that this would pretty much be a burial job, and in some ways it is and in another way its a nostalgic look back

so far vince has down documentarys on the awa,  world class  and ecw,  and i think its pretty much agreed that the ecw release is one of the best wwe documentaries period, but keep in mind,  ecw  was NEVER viewed as a threat to vince,  at the very least he never even seemed to take them seriously  and at best he was bankrolling paul heyman to stay in buisness  so there was a positive interest in ecw,  with world class, well, the story of world class is more bout how the von erichs all died off and as for the awa,  vince allowed everyone to basically say that  he raided their talent while at the same time pointed out how verne gagne wouldnt change with the times

with WCW  vince first takes us back to the beginning of jim cockett promotions and actually lets the crocket brothers and dusty rhodes get the chance to say how good their product was, and anyone who watched wrestling in the 80s  will prob agree with that opinion  that in terms of in ring talent,  mid 80s nwa was 2nd to none, im goign to have to agree with arn anderson when he says that had the nwa not gone any further north then philadelphia,  and no further west then chicago  and kept their travel  small  they'd stayed in business  but the crocker's desire to spend money like vince along with dusty booking started to bankrupt the company,
its fair to say that NO ONE liked ole anderson when he was in charge so less said the better,  jim herd?  nuff has been said bout him too, when they mention bill watts,  im surprised they didn't bring up the fact that he was let go because of a remark he made about how a white business owner should have the right to not serve a black if he chooses,  now  am i going to call watts a racist?  considering that it was watts who made ron simmons a champion for wcw,  its hard to believe that a real hardcore racist would put the world title on a black guy  , however watts was def too politcally incorrect for wcw and besides  why would you try to promote you company as having a bunch of tough bad asses but then take away off the top rope moves?

truthfully theres nothign covered in the bischoff years that wasn't already mentioned in the monday night wars dvd from  2004,  but i was shocked to see goldberg included for an interview,  he has sworn to want to have nothign to do with vince,  but i guess when he was offered the chance to speak, it was better if he spoke for himself instead of take a chance and have the wwe  pull an ""ultimate warrior"" on him ,  on a side note  vince can make a deal with goldberg  but he couldn't  do an interview with randy savage for his dvd?  don't get me started on that

anywho  we fast forward to the vince russo years and pretty much the only person who had any decent words for russo was jim ross  (ive yet to see jim ross do any of these documentaries and speak ill of anyone) then we get to jeff jarret  and ah,  can you tell mike graham doesnt care for ol  double-J?  i was surprised to see they included the 2000 bash at the beach mess tween jarrett and hogan  but i couldn't help but think that this was vince's way of saying  ""hey you give me grief over screwing bret in montrel,  look what they did to hogan!!""

all in all this documetnary could had been worst, could had been better,  if your looking for some history on the crockett years then the first half of the show is pretty good,  one we get into the monday night wars years then year, here comes the burial,  i mean when you got the big show spenind most of him time bitchign bout halls and nash's contracts, ..yeah  there were some sour grapes..

still at least vince gave wcw a better send off then he did ultimate warrior",1251244800,2,4269,4.18865598027127
3875045,5,B0028X36EE,"Back in the day, WCW was wrestling for me.  If it wasn't for WCW I would have never have began watching sports entertainment.  For over a decade I've been watching wrestling and the time spent watching WCW before its demise is a small fraction of the time when compared to WWE and TNA.  Yet even now, those years of WCW remain the epitome of wrestling for me.  I became enthralled watching the battles between Sting, Flair, Hogan, Goldberg, nWo Hollywood, nWo Wolfpac, Diamond Dallas Page, and many others.  It had action, drama, good vs evil, yet had a realistic edge to it all.  Quite simply, WCW had everything that mattered to me.  I loved it so much that I had an extreme brand loyalty to WCW.  Even at what many consider its lowest points I still watched, and enjoyed it immensely.  I liked Sting in his back in black persona, I liked Flair beating Bishoff and becoming the president and his subsequent fall into craziness.  I liked the united nWo Wolfpac and Hollywood with Hogan at its head.  There were still many enjoyable things during the year 1999 for me.  Even in the year 2000 there were things I enjoyed, particularly the Sting and Vampiro feud and the Millionaire's Club vs the New Blood angle as a whole.  The Silver and Black nWo was even cool.  I continued to watch and enjoy WCW up until the final Nitro in Panama Beach Florida.

So in short, I am easily the target audience for the release of the DVD The Rise and Fall of WCW.

I eagerly anticipated this release, knowing full well the negative bias and slant that WWE has given towards the WCW legacy.  I have often been disappointed in the WWE in this respect.  I have even been more disillusioned by WWE with the blunders they committed on the utilization of WCW properties like the WCW invasion, the nWo, and many of WCW's former talent.  I mean, DDP the motivational speaker and stalker?  I mean, seriously, the things WWE has done in this area are as bad, if not worse, than anything WCW did itself in its lowest of lows.  So I get as annoyed as anyone when WWE mishandles and bad mouths the WCW legacy.

But with that being said, I did in fact enjoy The Rise and Fall of WCW Documentary.  All in all it is an even handed and fair approach to WCW.  Do I agree with everything said?  Of course not, and there are several things that I don't think are accurately portrayed, but overall it was an immensely pleasant watch and I am glad I bought it.  To be able to see the old WCW in action like this DVD does made me wax nostalgic and bring back a flood of memories.  It was worth every penny for this aspect alone.  I miss those days of wresting and to be able to witness them again, if for only brief moment, is something this DVD set excels at.

Like others, my main complaint is that many aspects of the legacy of WCW is glanced over if not outright missing.  The WWE often acts like WCW went out of business right after 1998 if not sooner than that, and only shows past 1998 when showing some of the worst of WCW.  There was some good stuff during that time, in my opinion and it's annoying that the documentaries basically stop there.  I for one would like to see both the good and even more of the bad of those years.  That being said, a good portion of these missing parts from Rise and Fall of WCW, most pre 1999, are scattered across many DVDs already produced by WWE (The Monday Night Wars, nWo: Back in Black, Starrcade The Essential Collection, The Ric Flair Definitive and Four Hoursemen collections, Hulk Still Rules, and The Greatest Wrestlers of the 90's, just to name some off the top of my head).  There is still a TON left to explore, and I hope that the WWE continues to give us more of the WCW footage they have.  A Definitive Sting DVD collection?  How about a definitive nWo DVD set chronicling all the various forms from the beginning, to the Wolfpac, and even the silver and black?  Or how about a best of Nitro set?  I know I would buy them and love them.  And to be fair, it really is unrealistic to expect the WWE to have much more than what they did have for the Rise and Fall of WCW documentary.  Could they do more?  Probably, but I just I hope they continue to produce DVDs high lighting the WCW because like I said there is still a lot left to show.  But to hold that against what is a great DVD set is a travesty.

In closing The Rise and Fall of WCW is a must have for any wrestling fan.  The WCW left an indelible mark upon the sports entertainment industry and provided hundreds of hours of some of the best aspects of professional wrestling in history.  While not perfect, this DVD set is excellent and gives WCW and wrestling fans a chance to relive some of the greatest moments in professional wrestling from the late great WCW.

3875046,5,B0028X36EE,"I'm surprised at all the negative reviews as this is a fine documentary. I admit it might have been nice if a bit longer but still a great look at the company's rise. Folks complain of the emphasis on Crockett miss the point that you have to see how strong it was and more in tune with real wrestling to appreciate how it all fell apart. Keep in mind, so many docs have touched on aspects folk complain about missing on this:
*Flair vs Bischoff is discussed on the Flair and Horsemen DVDs
*The Monday Night War talks more of WWE vs the Nitro and such
*The Bret Hart DVD discusses his time there
*The Benoit and Guerrero DVDs mark the Radicals leaving.

You'd need another hour for all those and I think WWE was held by some time limits. What we do get is a great look at the company that gives props to those in charge at times for keeping it going and providing great entertainment for people. This is no burial, guys put over the company so much like Jericho, Big Show, Malenko and even Jim Ross says he misses a lot of it. It was great to see Goldberg and Bill Watts interviewed on their times there and covering the ups and downs behind the scenes and how this company appeared to let anyone BUT wrestling people in charge and how that suffered. The crusierweights and Nitro get props and it's fun hearing Russo and Jarrett get the burials they deserve (""Jeff Jarrett broke 6000 guitars and didn't draw a dime""). The extras are all good too with ""Lost in Cleveland"" along with great matches like Luger & Sting vs the Steiners (although I do think it's time to put on another Hogan/Flair match rather than Bash at the Beach 94 for the sixth time). Ignore the nitpcikers, as the story of WCW, this is one of the best yet and makes you miss that company's good times all the more.",1251244800,,1781,4.316417910447761
3875047,2,B0028X36EE,"I understand Jim Ross is probably more available to track down than Tony Schiavone, but TS meant more to JCP and WCW than Jim Ross ever did. Ross has turned into a WWE house boy, and TS was the voice for the promotion for nearly 20 years. It was bad enough we had to stomach him on the AWA DVD....a company he never worked for and had nothing to do with, but he said a little too much, and the World Class DVD for that matter. I am sick of Jim Ross, when he talks about these other promotions, he always has to add the WWE twist on it, how they are successful and how the other companies crumbled. Tony Schivone should have been on this DVD, I always liked him better than Jim Ross anyways.",1251244800,5,690,4.080882352941177
3875048,3,B0028X36EE,"As stated in a prior review, I will not focus on the matches or the extras (although the Booker T-Lance Storm Match was great and I was SEVERELY disappointing that the Goldberg-Hogan Nitro match was not included on the DVD). Nevertheless, here is my review:

I was salivating over getting this DVD for 8 years, and I honestly believed that the WWE crippled the hype on this DVD by bringing out the Monday Night War documentary and talking about the demise of WCW on WWE Confidential years earlier. A lot of the documentary is in a ""cut and paste"" format from these two productions. In other words, I honestly believe this documentary would've been--quite possibly--the greatest wrestling DVD ever if they would've made it a 3 hour documentary (like the Rise and Fall of ECW ) incorporating an extensive look at the Monday Night Wars within it. But due to prior documentaries, the DVD did not have the ""punch"" that it should've had.

However, despite the fact it didn't live up to the hype, it really wasn't a bad DVD. I was very proud that this documentary went back to the days of JCP an involved people like Jim and David Crockett, as well as Goldberg. In fact, the extra dealing with the Origin of Goldberg is classic, in my opinion. Also, it expounded more on the Jim Herd era in WCW, and showed the truth of what Barry Windham said in the Horsemen DVD about him ""not knowing how to run a wrestling company"" (the ""Ding Dong's"" LMBO). Also, it was nice to see someone admit that the David Arquette World title run was a complete joke (this is when I personally stopped watching WCW). The Bill Watts segment was very interesting in the fact that I didn't know he removed the mats from outside the ring because he wanted to somehow prove that WCW was tougher than the WWE (which further explains why it was a good idea to get rid of this guy).

Overall, I gave this DVD three stars because it was better than average but not great. It definitely will not get the play time in the player like the Horsemen DVD, but I do see some times of review ahead in its future.",1251244800,,2065,4.443271767810026

[...]

Match selection is quite good especially with the two Midnights matches which haven't seen DVD release. If you haven't seen the Great American Bash '90 match with The Southern Boys prepare to have your mind BLOWN.

If only for comedy, this documentary is worth watching to see Mike Graham spit some serious B.S. If Mike Graham was as smart as he wishes us to believe he might have been something more than a babyface in his daddy's promotion. The ""Better Suited if it was titled ""The Rise & Fail of a WCW Documentary"" review summed it up very well.",1251244800,,667,4.635593220338983
3875050,1,B0028X36EE,"This set has some great matches attached to it that are worth seeing.  The documentary itself is horrendous.  There are so many inaccuracies, so much left out and so much twisted that it doesn't reflect the history of WCW at all.  It's one of the worst documentaries WWE has ever produced.  It's a travesty for WCW and NWA fans.  Just awful.",1251244800,8,341,4.524590163934426
3875051,3,B0028X36EE,"Here's my take on ""The Ride and Fall of WCW"".  While not WWE's stongest documentive effort, this DVD is still a very well rounded history of WCW.  What people seem to forget is that 80% of the what they say isn't covered in this DVD has already been covered in numerous other WWE releases (more on this later).  Had this footage been reused everyone would be complaining that WWE is trying to rehash the ""Monday Night War"" DVD.  Now that being said, the WWE aren't fools and why would they compile all the footage on one DVD when they can make you buy 5 more DVDs to get the full story?  Now does this make hardcore wrestling fans angry?  Yes and No.  Yes if you wanted all of your WCW history in one Box set, but most wrestling fans already own the other DVDs that I'm speaking of.  Now with that being said I agree with others in saying that there are some things that were brushed over (finger poke of doom) or not even covered at all (Hogan/Sting build up for Starcade etc.).  I was a huge WCW fan back in the day, well that is until they rebooted it into the mess that eventually killed it, and I know that WCW faithful were hoping for a little more than what was on this disc.  But let's face it had WWE made a WCW DVD that would have made everyone happy it would have been about a 4 1/2 or 5 hour documentary.  Not to say that I wouldn't have wanted that (in fact I do want that) but I guess WWE wanted to keep it at a family friendly 2 hour length.  All in all it's not a bad release but we were spoiled with ""The Rise and Fall of ECW"" set and expected more.  I would love to see someone create the ultimate WCW documentary using footage from theses DVDs and editing them together: The Monday Night War, NWO: Back in Black, Hulk still rules, Bret Hart's DVD, the 4 Horsemen, and the Starcade dvd.  If done properly it would cover 90-95% of what everyone is complaining is missing in this set.  Still this is a must have for hardcore WCW fans.",1251244800,,1950,4.1626666666666665
3875052,2,B0028X36EE,"Wow. All the promise and capabilities this had for being truly great with all the history of the NWA/WCW. What a huge, huge letdown. 2 stars is being very generous.
Again..instead of the history and the rise and fall of the company, this is nothing more than ""we, the WWE are the greatest, and all other promotions, whether historal, groundbreaking, popular, whatever, are garbage and failures"". Jim Ross has recently memo'd that this ""is not a WWE hatchet job"". LOL. It is in fact. Jim Ross is a WWE minion and toes the company line and kisses ***.
So many misses. No mention of Bret Hart. What? Are you serious? It was a huge part of the company near the end. Barely anything on Sting. What? Sting, along with Flair and Rhodes, WAS the WCW. And like him or not, having Bischoff not involved in this project is devastating for what this documentary is supposed to be. The whole Flair/Bischoff thing needed to be done on here and it was basically bypassed as well.
So what you have here, is an incomplete rush job. Its a shame too. And the match selection? Jeezus. 1/2 the matches are good and the other half have no business being on any release. And who picks these things? HOW MANY DVD's does ""Flair vs. Hogan, Bash at the Beach"" have to be on??????? We've seen this a million times, please, put other matches on DVD's. On another note, in no reference to this DVD, how many DVD's are they going to put the ""Flair vs. Steamboat, Chi-town rumble"" on??
The match's put forth on DVD releases from the WWE are starting to look eerily similar and they better change their ways/policies on this. People are getting sick of seeing matches copied and copied on follow up DVD's when there are hundreds of other match's to pick from. Almost makes you think whoever is up there putting these together has little if no wrestling knowledge. Hey Vince, how about a job? If these clowns can't get it done, i can't do any worse.
Its a nice try, but even the WWE should fire the staff who worked on this, very poorly put together, rushed, and not even close to the story of WCW. Once again, treating fans as if they know nothing about wrestling history, past wrestlers, etc.
Fair and balanced? No. Self-serving to the WWE? Absolutely.",1251244800,6,2220,4.524875621890548
3875053,3,B0028X36EE,"I never review anything but felt it necessary on this one.

If you have seen The Rise & Fall of ECW DVD, you'd have been hard pressed to believe that this one would fall so short. Considering Eastern Championship Wrestling, later on becoming Extreme Championship Wrestling, had a life span far shorter than WCW and its Jim Crockett Promotion ties, this disc should have had tons more info to share.

The ECW disc was so informative, and not just from the stand point of the players involved. It spoke on its biggest feuds, changing points in the company, the ways they were able to grow and compete with the ""Big 2"" and made you understand how important and revolutionary their company was. It spoke on the history of its biggest players and how them coming to ECW helped their business. It was also shown in detail of how the company ruined itself. Some of that was in the WCW disc, mostly the competing with WWE, but not enough.

And while I know I may sound like a mark, I am a big WCW fan and feel there will never be a bigger angle in the history of wrestling bigger than the NWO, for better or worse. But I was a fan of WCW even before then. So why not recap the history of the ""Big Gold Belt"" briefly. I mean WWE still uses its likeness, so why not show it some love. Talk about how it was separated from the NWA Championship and the whole 9 yards. I think one would believe it was the same belt from the Crockett Promotion glancing over this.

Another strange thing to me is how Sting-Hogan is just refused to even be mentioned, it wasn't mentioned in the Monday Night Wars disc either. If you think about it, it is one of the last feuds to take that 80's and earlier approach in where Sting and Hogan had a long, drawn out program before fighting at Starrcade. Stranger than that, how they refuse to speak on Sting period. Sting turning into ""The Crow"" in gimmick because he felt betrayed by WCW was huge. Sting was WCW. For him to portray himself as a free agent, attacking random WCW wrestlers, the coming from the rafters, the black bat and white face paint was just as new for WCW as the NWO. I feel that the Sting/Crow gimmick/angle was a big turning point in WCW as Sting was the NWO's biggest threat and rival ever. Let's not even mention the feuds he had with Vader, Flair, ect. I think him wrestling Flair as the last match ever in WCW was a testament to who the ""guys"" were of that company.

The last big miss in this DVD to me is the failure to mention Bret Hart and how they failed to utilize him when coming over to WCW. After the ""Montreal Screw Job"", WCW could have went over big time if they did good with ""The Hitman"". Instead, they used him in a lame NWO storyline (if he would join or not, seen that a million times), a weird role as a back-up referee in the Sting/Hogan Starrcade match, actually joining the NWO and a early retirement from a Goldberg MMA kick to the head. How could that not be included as a epic fail. And speaking of epic fail, how about Ultimate Warrior...

Also, the little attention that was giving to the Hogan/Goldberg match (I've still never seen a hotter crowd than that) and the brief mention of the ""Finger Poke of Doom"" was confusing. No mention of the Ric Flair/Horseman reunion that won the ratings that one glorious night when WWE had regained control and Bischoff's hatred of Ric Flair. The departure of X-Pac, The Radicals (Benoit, Malenko, Saturn, Guerrero) along with Big Show and Jericho jumping ship and WCW's failure to jump off the NWO ship all played a part in its demise. Let's not forget, not only did WWE take back over the ratings, WCW was pulling in horrid numbers by the time it ended in comparison. Also, WCW's attempt to infuse new talent with the old guys (Millionaires Club vs The New Blood, Hogan and Billy Kidman had a feud for God sakes) and them pushing younger guys in general (3 Count brought you The Hurricane/Shane Helms, and I still remember A.J. Styles doing the ""Styles Clash"" as a part of the team ""Air Raid"" on Thunder lol).

I know this all seems like a lot of rambling, but when something you have enjoyed so much has no chance of coming back, you would at least like to see it given a fair send off. And with the extensive collection of footage and stories the WWE has in the vault, I thought this would be a lot better then it was. But it seems like more slanted WWE perceptive and a quick cash in on all us true WCW fans.

On a side note, I hate how much self-promoting and WWE promoting Flair and Big Show did on this disc. Jericho did some too, but he genuinely was held down in his last months in WCW, so I can somewhat understand his take. But Big Show was booked as a monster in his ""Dungeon of Doom"" days and they put the strap on him. If you ask me, he hasn't done much more in WWE then he did in WCW, especially for his size. Ric Flair, that is a conversation in itself. This DVD left me waiting for the hot tag only to be giving the cold shoulder.",1251158400,83,4954,4.279615795090715
3875054,2,B0028X36EE,"The start of the dvd with story of how WCW started is AWESOME. All that lead up and all the info and views really makes the first dvd the best of the set.

The classic matches are good too. It spans from 85 to 94. These are all great matches with numerous matches with Sting, Flair, Lugar and great tag matches.

Unfortunately, the third disc is not put together well at all. Only two good matches on this dvd, being the NWO vs WCW Fall Brawl and Steiners vs Outsiders. There should have been WAY better matches, mostly consisting of the NWO Black and White as well as the Wolfpac, which was easily the biggest Rise of WCW. You have to guess that they are gonna make a NWO 3 disc dvd that will span this, but unfortunately, its not on this set as it should be. When you end the dvd with Booker T vs Lance Storm that will ruin anything.",1251158400,4,835,4.148148148148148
3875055,5,B0028X36EE,"Just received this long awaited DVD, so here's my review:

I'll stick to the packaging and content of the doc, because it looks like most have already listed the matches.
First, whoever is in the art department over at WWE designing the look of these DVD covers and packaging, deserves
a raise! Excellent cover, and your jaw will drop when you open up the digi-pak and see the two panels of art staring
you in the face. One panel is an awesome collage of Arn Anderson, Ric Flair and Goldberg, while the other features
the Outsiders, Sting and Hogan holding up the spray-painted WCW world title belt. Great stuff!

Now, as for the documentary. If you're like me and you have a stack of WWE DVDs at home, you've seen your fair
share of WWE produced documentaries on wrestlers and rival promotions. They have all contained a little bit of
revisionist history, but this one is hands down the worst when it comes to this. Again, Dusty Rhodes is still not
taking any responsibility for the fall of Jim Crockett Promotions. Yes, JCP was poorly run from a business sense, but
Dusty pushed himself to the moon and was cramming himself down the fan's throats and it hurt business big time!
They skip over big parts of the companies history like why Vince Russo was brought in, how Eric was let go and then
brought back and the reasons behind it and they completely ignored the mass jumping from WCW to WWF by Benoit,
Guerrero, Saturn and Malenko. That was a HUGE story at the time, and signaled to wrestling fans that WCW was in
trouble. I understand why they no longer want to mention Benoit, but they could've talked about this without even
mentioning his name. That was disappointing. And I don't believe Vince for a second when he describes how he felt
after purchasing WCW. If he truly felt that way, then he's not human. Watch it and judge for yourself.
No mention of Bret Hart... at all?! Really? No mention of WCW missing the boat on Austin? No mention of the talent
trade agreement and later raids of the original ECW? So much was left out that the documentary feels slapped
together. To this day, still the best WWE produced documentaries can be found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-ECW/dp/B0001Y4LZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rise and Fall of ECW</a>

The documentary does have some great moments. I was thrilled to see Kevin Sullivan interviewed for this, who looks
great by the way. Kevin offered some refreshing insights and was an excellent addition to the older interviews included
that we've seen on other WWE documentaries numerous times over the years.
It was nice to hear from Harvey Schiller, would've liked to have heard more from him.
It was nice to see them acknowledge where the idea for the nWo came from - an angle in New Japan Pro Wrestling.
I was glad to see WWE acknowledge how the WCW cruiserweights were one of the most important factors in making
Nitro the must-see show every Monday night. As a fan back then, I know they were the reason why I would watch
Nitro instead of Raw, that's for sure. In fact, those cruiserweight matches are some of the only matches worth re-watching
from that era in WCW's history.
Goldberg talking about the creation and evolution of his character & career was pretty cool. He shared a few things that
I had never heard before. Also, check the extras for ""The Origin of Goldberg"" which offers some great little stories about
how Goldberg's character and gimmicks came to be.
I also liked how they acknowledged that several people within WCW believed Russo was being controlled by Vince McMahon
and did the things he did to put WCW out of business. That's been a longtime wrestling rumor, and WWE usually doesn't
discuss those rumors.
Finally, they really stuck it to Jeff Jarrett, thus WWE is sticking it to TNA, when talking about him in the documentary. Fair or
unfair, it's entertaining to watch.

Overall, the documentary really leaves you wanting more. I would give the doc portion 2 stars, but the matches I give 5.
As for the matches, there are some classics here, many of which are making their DVD debut! All of the NWA matches
here are great and worth your time. Being a huge Vader fan, I was glad to see his match against Sting included here from
the Great American Bash '92. Also, Rude vs. Sting from Spring Stampede '94 is pretty solid. Flair vs. the Giant and the cruiserweight
bouts make the best of what's on disc 3.

This is definitely a buy, but don't get your hopes up over seeing an insightful or revealing documentary.

UPDATED 9/07/2009
A user in the Comments section wanted to hear more about the matches, so I thought I would add a little bit about that.
Match compilations on these DVDs are tough because it's impossible to please everyone, myself included. And when
you consider the rich history of NWA/WCW, you don't even come close to scratching the surface of it with just 2 DVDs
worth of matches. Most of the matches are good choices. I was glad to see Vader vs. Sting where Vader captures the
world title on this release. Jericho vs Juventud is an underrated classic cruiserweight bout, and having Juventud's mask
on the line just adds to the drama. Syxx vs. Eddie Guerrero is a satisfying ladder match from the terrible nWo themed PPV Souled Out.
While not as violent as today's ladder matches, it's still action packed and tells a great story. Goldberg's best in-ring performance
is here against, of all people, DDP. Perhaps the DVDs best must-see match is the classic tag team bout pitting Sting and Lex Luger
against the Steiner Brothers. This is a tremendous match that you should go out of your way to see! Plus, it was also nice to see
the Big Show's first world title win against Ric Flair on Nitro. I remember being so bummed that Flair lost the belt so soon after
winning it when that match aired.

Now, with that said, I would have cut Flair vs. Hogan, Flair vs. Steamboat, Midnight Express vs. Southern Boys, Rey vs. Malenko, the
celebrity tag match, Booker T vs. Lance Storm & the Outsiders vs. the Steiners and replaced them with...

1. Ron Simmons vs. Big Van Vader for the WCW World Title (WCW Saturday Night) - why on earth this match didn't make this set
is beyond me! Not only was it a great match, it was important from a historical perspective. One of the top glaring omissions from
this DVD.

2. Ric Flair vs. Randy Savage vs. Sting Triangle match for the WCW World Title from Starrcade. I think most of us would agree that we've
wanted WWE to release this match for quite some time. It was a really great bout and one of Flair's best title wins.

3. Rey Mysterio vs. Ultimo Dragon from the first World War III PPV - Here's another one that I don't understand why WWE has never released
on DVD. It was easily my favorite Mysterio match from his WCW run. These two went all out that night, and I saw high flying moves I had never
seen before.

4.  Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader in Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal from Halloween Havoc. Tremendous brawl from these two, but it won't see
the light of day now that Mick is in TNA, which is a shame.

5. Sting vs. Flair from the 1990 Great American Bash - Sting's finally beating Flair for the title should've made it on this set.

6. First War Games match - I agree with another reviewer, War Games was such a huge part of WCW that to not include the first one is a shame.
I understand why they included the match they did (it set up Sting's transformation into the Crow character), but it would've been nice to still see
the first one on this set. Maybe we'll see a War Games themed DVD set in the future instead?

7. Rick Rude vs. Steamboat Iron Man Match from Beach Blast - Their feud was touched on briefly during the doc, so why not show their best match?

Well, that's what I would've done. The match selection was still good and worth a look.",1251158400,19,8176,4.710986703988803

3875057,1,B0028X36EE,"Well since people can rate something they haven't seen as 5 stars and other people who follow a cult can rate it 3 stars, I give it 1 star because I haven't seen it yet.  WELL Now I have seen this awful documentary,  If you want footage from 2002 and 2003 from DVDs you have already seen then you will love this.  Is there anything on this DVD you haven't seen before.  Everyone thought they were gonna bury Russo so they dedicated 7 minutes to him and it wasn't that much of a burial.  THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS WHOLE DVD WHICH IS AMAZING is GOLDBERG seems to have been the only thing new and worth watching, Even though he has a skewed memory of the Atlanta 40,000 people NITRO, where he knew he was going to wrestle Hogan in a Dark match way before hand, he acted like it was he had no knowledge of going to even wrestle Hogan.  But Besides that GOLDBERG IS the only standout here.  Very Little WATTS stuff,  VEry Little HERD stuff,  A little more Mid Altantic, JCP and GCW but not much.  NO Kip Frey stuff and his attempts to make WCW get back on track with Superbrawl 2.  NO BENOIT  NO PILLMAN except for one second shot at the end.  I AM NEVER FALLING FOR THESE STUPID WWE REMAKES OF THE PAST, they could have gone so much deeper and as for match selection WOW THEY WENT ON A LIMB,  Bet you haven't ever seen these matches before.

I grew up watching Crockett's stuff on TBS every Saturday night, so this will be a great way to relive those memories.",1247961600,2,281,4.090909090909091
3875059,5,B0028X36EE,"Like a lot of people, I'm certainly looking forward to this. After seeing DVD sets for ECW, AWA and WCCW, it's about time to see one documenting NWA/WCW, even if it will be biased towards WWE. But considering things, it makes me wonder why they didn't release this years ago instead of the Monday Night War DVD, especially since they will incorporate the WWE/WCW war into the upcoming release. Still, I'm pleased with what this DVD release will feature.

But I think the WWE could've come up with a better title than ""The Rise and Fall of WCW."" That title worked great for the ECW set, but WWE could've been more original with something like ""The Life and Death of WCW"" or ""The Prosperity and Struggles of WCW."" I'm just saying.",1247961600,2,728,4.557251908396947

3875063,4,B0028X36EE,"will it be re-written to favor WWE, no question !  will it be 100% accurate ?  No chance. BUT will it be entertaining YES !!!!  Eric Bischoffe deserves NO credit for contributing anything positive to WCW. He led it down the drain with his own ego. Had he bothered to respect talent such as Ric FLair and listen to some of the veteran road agents on how to book a decent product and build up and coming talent WCW might still be around.  Instead he just brought in stars past their prime, squashed the veterans who DID have some gas left in the tank, and blatanty favor Hulk Hogan and obnoxious A-holes like Scott Steiner and Buff Bagwell.  The NWO was an interesting concept for about a month, then it got STALE and it just refused to go away.  Eric put celebrities like Jay Leno?????????  in the ring and thought it was his personal playground (see Hog Wild, where they booked an entire pay per view event around Eric's motorcycle hobby ).  The NWA/WCW era was WCW at it's BEST !  The Bischoffe years, well i believe the phrase ""you can't polish a turd"" somes it up best !!!!!!!",1244678400,,1079,4.381909547738694
3875064,3,B0028X36EE,"I'm looking forward to this one, but I'm very skeptical.  I've got the Monday Night Wars DVD and share the same opinion with many that it was blatantly geared to re-write history to favor the agenda (what is this agenda, and what will it get them?) of the WWF.

It has been reported in the Observer that in addition to the obvious current WWF talent that once wrestled for WCW (Jericho, Show, Mysterio Jr., etc.), they also brought in guys like Jim Crockett, David Crockett, Dr. Harvey Schiller (remember that guy??), Kevin Sullivan (very interesting name to hear from) and BILL GOLDBERG~!  It'll be interesting to see what these guys will have to say, or should I say, be allowed to say (obviously whatever WWF doesn't like won't make it onto the show).

Eric Bischoff turned it down with a very, VERY funny comment about not wanting to ""...give credibility to their revisionist history"".  AMEN, Eric!!  For all of his faults that helped lead to the downfall of WCW, it was Eric who did a lot of the building that got WCW to where it was.  While Eric deserves some blame for the demise of the company, it's a shame that so many people choose not to recognize all of the positive contributions Eric has made to the business, like him or not.

One thing I'll perversely enjoy seeing is the utter (and you know it's inevitable) BURIAL~! of Vince Russo.  Seriously, you know it's coming.  And it'll be GREAT!!!  (Say what you may, I have no respect whatsoever for Vince Russo and his ""contributions""--I use that term loosely--to wrestling)

Anybody with any familiarity to how WWF likes to conduct business will be watching for each and every inaccuracy, false truth, and blatant lie that could and undoubtedly will be on this DVD.

It's not going to be the most honest, nor will it be the most historically accurate story.  But hey, it'll be entertaining, so that must make it ok.",1244160000,9,1878,4.634441087613293

I don't believe we should blame the N.W.O. for the downfall rather the lack of ideas and individuals to create good guys to balance out the bad guys in N.W.O.. Bischoff did some much good for WCW wrestling but lost control when he got in the spotlight and then Russo destroyed everything. I wish the WCW was still here so there would be competition on TV. The Vince show has just gotten awful in my opinion and that's why I don't watch wrestling anymore. I'd rather remember the days when it was really competitive between companies. The matches really make this DVD set fantastic. Lots of Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Sting, and Hulk Hogan. You get the entire Diamond Dallas Page vs Goldberg match at Halloween Havoc 98 that went off the air during the match causing WCW to refund millions to pay-per-view customers and should be blamed for the beginning of the end of WCW and it's mismanagement.
