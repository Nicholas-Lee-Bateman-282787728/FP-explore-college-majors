8707163,1,B00UK6NMUE,"I was intrigued when I saw this DVD, because it had 2 videos of Patsy that I never saw on DVD before, ""Blue Moon Of Kentucky"" and ""He Called Me Baby"". But I should have been warned when I saw it was not really Patsy on the DVD cover. The video quality is horrible. The videos have been pulled off of You Tube. Most of the video have PC in the corner of the screen and were lifted from the DVD ""Sweet Dreams Still: An Anthology"", but like 5th or 6th generation transfer. The ""Ranch Party"" Segment has Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash too. ""Blue Moon Of Kentucky"" has the first few words missing. ""He Called Me Baby"" is a compilation video with photos and footage from ""A Church A Courtroom and Then Goodbye"". So this is a waste of money and should be pulled from the market. Only for hardcore Patsy Cline fans, and I consider myself one but sadly I wish I would have skipped this one....",1490572800,,882,4.224852071005917
8707164,4,B00UK6NMUE,"Patsy Cline had a lot of hits  and there are lots of CDs out there made during her brief life. But, though she appeared on TV often, not a lot of footage survives. There are a few DVD comps out there and I know the opening performance on this DVD  Crazy  appears on nearly all of them. But there are some here that I don't remember seeing.

There are a few things you should know up front: All of the clips of Patsy come from TV shows and the quality in those days was not great. In a few of the performances  most notably I Fall To Pieces have distorted sound, but that was inherent in the original.
  The listing on Amazon says the length is 51 minutes. It should be 31 minutes.

Though there are 10 tracks listed, the last one He Called Me Baby is not a performance but a slide show of images (including album covers) accompanied by the recording.

And you don't really get 31 minutes of Patsy because there are two nice bonuses: The track (chapter) listed as Ranch Party consists of THREE performance on that TV show from 1957 hosted by Tex Ritter. First we have Carl Perkins singing his hit Blue Suede Shoes and then Johnny Cash doing I Walk The Line. Next up is Patsy singling Ive Loved and Lost Again. This performance is also on Youtube.

Being only a casual Patsy fan (take that in to consideration when reading this review) I had not heard her fast version of Bill Monroes Blue Moon of Kentucky nor  my favorite performance here  the Hank Williams/Emmett Smith song (both recorded it), Lovesick Blues (from ""Community Jamboree"" with Ferlin Husky introducing her.

Theres no supplemental material here. Its just the full performances. So, if you are a Patsy fan youll know if you have all these performances. If not, you may want to pick it up. For first timers, though, don't expect high fidelity and really sharp images. Sadly, they just don't exist.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
