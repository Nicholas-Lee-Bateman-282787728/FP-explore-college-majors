2542553,5,B000EX9U0E,"***** 1956. Directed by Nicholas Ray. A teacher, suffering from a rare and painful disease, accepts to take cortisone, a new drug in the 50's, under medical surveillance. Unfortunately, the patient modifies his prescriptions and becomes little by little psychotic. This undisputable masterpiece presents in 95 minutes all the major Nicholas Ray themes: an idealistic hero who can't accept his average destiny, the bitter study of the American way of life and a smart use of the new Technicolor technology, with its new space offered to the directors, to name a few. Some scenes, like the scenes with the mirrors, are already part of Movie History. You can now buy a zone 2 DVD of BIGGER THAN LIFE at Amazon.fr with a perfect copy of the film and very interesting featurettes about the themes handled by Nicholas Ray in this film.

2542554,4,B000EX9U0E,"In BIGGER THAN LIFE, director Nicholas Ray and producer/star James Mason explored the dark side of suburban life.  James Mason delivers one of his most accomplished and subversive performances in this sadly-neglected 1956 movie gem, the story of a man pushed to the brink of madness thanks to his abuse of a 'miracle drug'.

Mild-mannered schoolteacher Ed Avery (James Mason) works hard to provide for his wife Lou (Barbara Rush) and young son Richie (Christopher Olsen), secretly working after-hours as a taxi switchboard operator.  When Ed is struck down by a debilitating and potentially fatal illness, doctors prescribe wonder drug Cortisone, and it seems to do the trick.  Ed feels more confident than he has in years, and loves to spoil the family with expensive trips to the department store.  But Ed's dependence takes a darker turn when he begins taking the pills in larger quantities.  Lou and Richie can only stand by helplessly as Ed angrily lashes out, hurling abuse and insults at his wife and son.  The mood swings only get worse as the weeks wear on, to the moment when Ed finally cracks completely...

I won't try to spoil any major plot points.  BIGGER THAN LIFE will surprise and shock you with it's hard-hitting subject matter, and the frank way it's depicted was I'm sure the main reason why the movie flopped in 1956.  It's well and truly the flipside of ""Father Knows Best"".  Today the movie still rings true because so many families are dealing with similar issues on a daily basis.  James Mason and Barbara Rush are completely mesmerising to watch here.  Child actors from the 1950's are normally very mannered and ""trained"" on screen, but young Christopher Olsen is heartbreaking as the tortured Richie; his performance absolutely rings true.  Walter Matthau, Kipp Hamilton and Roland Winters are also very fine.

I hope that Fox realises what a fantastic movie this actually was, and releases a full Special Edition sometime in the future.  In the meantime, the only way you can get this masterpiece on DVD is to order it from the UK or Australia.",1205020800,,2074,4.882857142857143
2542555,5,B000EX9U0E,"I have this film in HD, but I wanted it on regular DVD so I could play it on my computer. This is a marvelous film made during the ""wonder drug"" era of the mid-1950's. James Mason has never been better, and this is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of his. The movie is an honest, sometimes uncomfortable look into American family structure in the era of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Leave it to Beaver"", but this time, because of a reaction to a medication that makes dad psychotic, the happy family dynamic is turned on its head. Very well-acted and well-made movie.",1376352000,4,566,4.349056603773585
2542556,5,B000EX9U0E,"This unusual drama, directed by Nicholas Ray ('Rebel Without A Cause, Johnny Guitar, etc), does what the film adaptation of 'Revolutionary Road' did some 60 years later: it uses the idyllic 50's American suburban lifestyle as setting for a tale of mistrust, emotional instability, and a general feeling of unease.  Add to that an astoundingly sharp color palette employed by the cinematographer (a scene in which James Mason hurries through a taxi parking lot, between rows of brilliantly-colored cabs is a great example), superb cast (James Mason's finest maniacally near-evil father figure vs. Barbara Rush's atypically savvy post-war housewife), and the result is a cult favorite now recognized justifiably as well ahead of its time.  The unusual theme of a mild-mannered teacher (Mason) whose previously-thought fatal disease is 'cured' by a brand new drug that he abuses, resulting in behavior and personality changes ranging from a superiority complex to paranoia.. is still of interest to today's audience exposed to new drug ads on television, seemingly every night.  The drug, in this film, and its possible side effects, will sound familiar to many today; cortisone which is a strong form of steroid.  Seldom screened on television, it's worth purchasing or viewing via streaming services.  One showing might just make you a Nicholas Ray fan, as it did me.",1371254400,3,1366,5.276497695852535
2542557,5,B000EX9U0E,"As a mature person, I appreciate many of the older movies, and this movie has a lot to appreciate.  James Mason, Barbara Rush and Walter Matthau were simply great in executing their roles.  Pretty tragic scenario, which can happen to anyone on anyday.

Finally, but not least important, Criterion knocks this one (as they usually do) out of the park.  Just a marvelous transfer from a company that I have grown to expect nothing less.

2542560,4,B000EX9U0E,"Bigger Than Life is a story about Ed Avery, who develops a stomach condition and must take the new drug cortisone in order to save his life. The effect is immediately positive. Ed seems like a new man, but pretty soon the side affects kick in and change Ed in a way that both shocks and concerns his family. This story had me gripped even before I saw the film. For starters, I love James Mason, especially his role as Professor Lindenbrook in Journey to the Center of the Earth. In this film, he gives another performance of a lifetime. The movie takes no time in jumping right into the story and giving you all the facts you need. Yet, it does not give too much away so that you know the entire plot right away. It keeps you wanting more. *SPOILERS AHEAD* You watch James Mason slowly slip into a state of chaos as he grows fierce and moody. By the end, when he fights with Wally, played by Walter Matthau, you cannot wait to see what the outcome is. When the mother and the son are waiting in the hospital and the doctor reads them the diagnoses and the what will likely happen, I was waiting, and hoping for the worst as a matter of fact. Yet, in the end, we find that Ed has recovered completely and everyone will live happily ever after. What!? This whole movie sets itself up and executes itself like a movie way ahead of its time. It's intense and exciting, and even a bit frustrating. Yet the end slips back into a cliche ending that's entirely to cheesy and goes against the entire tone of the movie. Now I get that this movie is supposed to be a farce on the tradition American home, but I just felt that the ending was a bit of a let down. I would not have been upset if the outcome of Ed was a bit more harsh and depressing, but there was a ray of hope in the future. That would've fit so much better with the tone of the entire picture. So yes, the film was very good, and I enjoyed every minute of it, except for the last, which was a bit of a let down. But don't let that dissuade you from seeing this, or especially buying it on BluRay, because it looks absolutely beautiful on Blu Ray.",1345420800,2,2103,4.182266009852217
2542561,5,B000EX9U0E,"Ed Avery (James Mason) is a typical (though idealized) 1950s husband and father who is facing serious health problem.  To save his life, he begins taking the controversial new drug Cortisone which soon brings about a major - and quite shocking - personality transformation.

James Mason is superb in this role.  At first, he's charming and lovable, but gradually morphs into a horrifying monster.  He had me utterly convinced he was really vile and very dangerous.  Barbara Rush gives a good performance as his steadfast wife and Walter Matthau is likable in a supporting role as Ed's co-worker.  The movie was directed by Nicholas Ray (""Rebel Without a Cause"") and had some surprisingly blunt and realistic dialogue for 1956.

This story is even more relevant today with so much drug abuse and dependence.  Mason's transformation from `Father Knows Best' to `Mr. Hyde' is utterly believable and frightening.  Good movie.",1336262400,,921,5.12751677852349
2542562,5,B000EX9U0E,"This movie I saw many years ago and explained what had happened to my loving mother. I recommend this book to anyone whose mother or parent was used as a guinea pig for this drug. The doctor's never monitored what was happening to her mentally and the fallout on the family from the mental disturbances it created.  Yes, it did keep her alive from asthmatic attacks but the emotional and physical damage to the children was massive. We nearly lost her with the suicidal thoughts and threats of driving off the hill highway to kill herself. It was many years later that the drug changed to safety measures. I am so grateful for the company that put this movie out. It explained the terror we went through. This raw drug turned a lovely person into a monster.

2542564,5,B000EX9U0E,"An astonishing piece of work and one of the seminal films of the 1950s, Nicholas Ray's view of an archetypal suburban family, seemingly perfect on the surface, that briskly deteriorates when the father (James Mason) has a severe reaction to a new drug (Cortisone) that manifests itself in severe mood swings and delusions of superiority and a Messiah complex that threatens the safety of his wife (Barbara Rush) and son (Christopher Olsen). It's a disturbing film on many levels and so dark that it's no surprise that it was a commercial failure when first released. Mason is excellent, balancing the complex psychosis without going over the top. In the best performance of her career, the underrated Barbara Rush has the more difficult ""wife"" role and young Christopher Olsen (squeezing in this solid performance in between equally solid work for Hitchcock and Sirk) avoids the trap that mars so many child performances in 50s cinema. Ray, along with his cinematographer Joseph MacDonald (THE SAND PEBBLES), make expert use of the CinemaScope frame and David Raksin provides a strong underscore. Co-starring Kipp Hamilton and Walter Matthau in one of his early film roles. Highly recommended.

The Criterion DVD is a handsome anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer.",1318464000,,1266,5.205882352941177
2542565,5,B000EX9U0E,"Nicholas Ray has long been one of the most underrated directors. He may have been recognized and respected for his groundbreaking Rebel Without A Cause, but his much of his output was long ignored by  mainstream audiences and critics alike. The tide has recently been shifting and Ray's other output has begun to receive the recognition it deserves. Bigger than Life is Ray's 1956 effort concerning mental illness, drug use, and the 1950's family structure.

Bigger than Life tells the tale of Ed Avery, a good-natured school teacher who in the hard 50's is juggling an additional job at a Taxi company to provide for his family. As the pressure of everyday life and these two jobs mount up, he notices certain bouts of pain and even a few blackouts. Dismissing these episodes, it later becomes obvious to him and his family that he is unable to keep up with daily life in such a way. A specialist tells him that he has a very rare inflammation of the arteries; a condition that would grant him only a short few months to live. The only way of combating this disease is a new experimental steroid hormone called Cortisone. This abuse of this drug which Ed must take for the rest of his livelihood in has extremely adverse effects such as Psychosis, a condition with symptoms such as hallucinations and impaired judgment.

Ray's treatment of Ed's abuse of Cortisone is simply jaw-dropping. The audience continually waits and waits for a violent outburst, an outburst that literally tears the family apart-but it doesn't happen. Ray could have easily taken this condition and created a violent and physically abusive monster, but he keeps Ray controlled. On the surface, besides his little conspiracy and new-found ideologies Ed does not seem to be effected in a major way by the drug. Ray knows that if he transgresses toward violence and abusive, his film will become the average deleterious suburban family film. The film eventually does display Ed's breaking point, emotionally and psychologically, but does it with such subtle consideration that its arrival surprises and shocks. Ed's eventual violent outburst has such an unexpected biblical context that we uncontrollably grin at the screenplay's shrewd inclusion of this incident. It's not only the late inclusion of the Ed's biblical revelation, nor his alternation of it, but Ray's provocative method of approach.

Bigger than Life ushers back the era where films were not only simple in their approach, but even the conflicts were more clearly and effectively constituted. In Bigger Than Life, the adverse effects of the drug are so carefully displayed that at certain times it just seems as if he has gone through a spiritual and philosophical revelation. Ray treats psychosis as psychosis should be treated: multi-layered and channeling multiple symptoms. Nowadays, film freely display mental ill patients, such as Schizophrenics, as beginning at the peak of the disease, either with a single noticeable symptom or suddenly with all symptoms. Rarely do they spend time developing and showing the meager signs of mental illness, and eventually displaying the illness in its most domineering stages.

Bigger than Life is so focused in its approach to Ed's illness that it is overwhelming. There is no subordinate plot that disrupts the story or the audience's attention. The film is a reflection, a dark one, of the effects of drug use and how such use tears apart a man's soul, his family structure, and even is capable of turning him into a man that is unrecognizable in behavior, attitude, and demeanor. The underlying concept that Ray seems to continuously point towards is what makes a man? Is Ed still Ed after his experience with Cortisone? He looks like the previous Ed, and he responds when he is called by his name. However, no one seems to recognize him, his family does not recognize this deranged perfectionist father and husband with these newly developed ideas; even the milkman does not view Ed as he did before. Ed may be literally kept alive due to the Cortisone, but the drug drenched all of his personality and left everyone only with a shadow of the previous schoolteacher.

Bigger than Life was largely attacked and criticized after its release due to its skeptical view of the American family structure-not unsurprising, considering that it was released in the mid 50's. Ray's film may lack the jolting electricity it had for viewers at the time of its release, as such adverse effects of drugs have become better known and treated, but its unique and considerate approach still makes it one of the most , deftly executed, underappreciated, and singular cinematic works ever.",1287705600,3,4657,4.994845360824742
2542566,5,B000EX9U0E,"This 50s film on American suburbia now released on DVD sure packs a punch into the solar plexus of conformity. Mason,producing as well,gives one of his best performances in a Jeckyll and Hyde role. Ray was one of the great American directors. His use of colour was symbolical and expressive. His use of wide-screen Cinemascope opens up architectural space inside a suburban home. The use of light and shadow and camera angle to bring out extremes of emotion and a character's inner life and phantasy. Rush is superb as the supportive but anxious wife,Lou. Olse is excellent as Ritchie the son. And Mattau comes across well as an eccentric but affable colleague and family friend. He is concerned about his colleague's changes in mood and supports the wife and son.

The subject is,superficially,the use/abuse of a 'wonder drug',Cortisone,to heal Mason's physical disease. If he doesn't take this drug he is expected to live for only another year,and in crippling pain. However Mason takes more than he should,pretends to be a doctor,writing out his own prescriptions. This unlocks a pandora's box of psychosis and patriarchy:""God was wrong"",he declares, Abraham should have sacrificed Isaac. He is about to sacrifice his son with scissors after shutting his wife away in a cupboard. He is the template for any dictator, now his inner-Nietzsche has been liberated. I loved everything about this long lost masterpiece. Mason is unforgettable and brings the best of his acting skills to the part. One for the collectors",1283299200,2,1516,5.112903225806452

2542568,5,B000EX9U0E,"Once again, the Criterion Collection retains it's prestigious status in delivering quality films to people who truly appreciate the art of cinema, or in this case, cinemascope. I am happy to see this film receive the royal treatment and hold a nice warm place in this collection.

Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life cordially invites us to the nostalgic and conformist suburban life of the 1950's where milk men gleefully prance into your kitchen to deliver milk, obedient sons watch cowboys and indian television shows, stunningly beautiful and elegant wives are eager to please, and husbands happily work and take pride in their careers. Meet the Avery family.

  Ed Avery (James Mason) fits this description of an ideal husband during this time period quite nicely; he is hardworking, gregarious in both his professions as a school  teacher and, as a part time cab-driver, he is also responsible and very handsome. The condition of Ed's poor health is exposed immediately when we watch him uncomfortably and strenuously clench his pocket watch before teaching. Despite his on going pain, Ed continues to cope with it and does not let family, work or friends interfere. Unfortunately, the symptoms persist and grow with intensity to such an unprecedented level that he suffers his first blackout in his room. His wife, Lou, (Barbara Rush) rushes to his aid after hearing the alarming sound of Ed's body pummel to the floor. As a result, Ed is taken to the hospital by a fellow friend and co-worker, Wally (Walter Matthau).

Initially, Ed's condition is an enigma of all sorts until a team of specialized doctors diagnose him with a rare blood vessel disorder that has a poor prognosis; however, there is a chance of hope when a fairly new ""miracle"" drug is offered to Ed. It is called Cortisone. His subscribed dosage is to take 1 tablet every 6 hours. Ed is left little choice as he is told his condition will worsen and subsequently kill him in less than a year if he does not take the cortisone. Ed agrees half-heartedly. Within a couple of days of taking the medication, we see a completely revived and revamped Ed; he is more energetic, enthusiastic and a little spontaneous too at sometimes. Ed's pain-free life is just grand until he starts to disobey the prescribed dosage by taking 2-3 tablets at a time. Ed's addiction to the drug causes him to emit some rather alarming and erratic behavior. His altered behavior can be seen as comical, bizarre, unsettling, and just downright psychotic at some points. Ed's addiction destroys everything in his path; moreover, his family, friends and co-workers are all affected to some degree, especially the parents at PTO meeting (excellent scene). Ed's family observe his behavior in sheer horror but passively accept it because they love him and do not want him to die. After all, to them, Ed's bizarre behavior is just a symptom of the medication. The nuclear Avery family is mentally exhausted by Ed's addiction; emotions run high in feelings of frustration, sadness, confusion, depression and anger. We watch a loving and devoted family react and reflect upon this new crisis as so many other families do in America.

The acting performances in this film are nothing short of excellent. James Mason, Barbara Rush and their son are all convincing and authentic as the classic nuclear family of the 1950's. Walther Matthau's small role is also noteworthy as well. The bigger picture, or the real dilemma in this film is not how the family copes with a loved ones addiction but for how long will they cope with it. Watching Ed's addiction spin out of control makes us ponder the real disturbing question that is so prevalent towards the end of the film: Is a loved ones complete and sudden transformation into a monster worth living to the family or is he/she better off dead ?

In regards to the quality of the film presented courtesy of the Criterion Collection, I don't think we will ever receive a better presentation than this. This is another flawless picture that impressed me from start to finish; vibrant pastel colors will leap off your screen to perfection; interior and exterior shots will show incredible depth without losing the authentic look and feel of a 1950's film. A very light and uniform grain will please and leave very much to be desired here. Skin tones are pleasant to look at for the most part although some scenes expose a touch of artificial tampering in respect to lighting. All in all, this is the last thing you should be worrying about because the array of stylish dresses, professional wardrobes, and casual clothing are enough to fully compensate; moreover, fabric detail is fine and very sharp. The sound, which is presented in a uncompressed full monaural soundtrack is also very serviceable; pops, hisses, crackles are non existent; dialogue is crisp and very articulate.

In conclusion, another beautiful and valuable piece of artwork is added to the Criterion Collection. A must buy.",1272240000,4,4972,4.90952380952381
2542569,3,B000EX9U0E,"This medical ""scare"" film is quaint and antiquated in its sweaty-browed Cortisone paranoia.
James Mason turns in a typically well-crafted performance as Ed Avery, a normal middle-class man working two jobs to provide his family with the American dream.  When he is diagnosed with a rare and fatal arterial inflammation, he begins a regimen of cortisone hormones, which, while alleviating his pain, affect his personality in dark and disturbing ways.
Soon the family is torn apart by Ed's psychotic ramblings and wild-eyed accusations of calumny, infidelity and deceit.
Some viewers have posited that this film is an indictment of 1950's era conformism.  If that was the filmmaker's intention, then they have carried it out quite disingenuously; the film wraps up quite neatly with a pat and trite denouement- delivering Avery back into the warm arms of the domesticity he so loudly railed against.
There are a few scenes that are truly chilling, particularly Mason's speech involving Abraham and Isaac (don't want to spoil anything here).
There is a sort of anti-drug hysteria here that echoes films like ""Reefer Madness""- a sort of under-informed and melodramatic terror.

This follows the story of an all-American middle class guy with a pretty wife and nice kid... he's an underpaid schoolteacher working a part time second job as a lowly cab dispatcher just to make ends meet.  He's Mr. Good Guy and Mr. Moral Guy.  You want this guy to succeed and be happy, but life clubs him bigtime over the head and doesn't hold back.  A life-threatening illness threatens to take him out so he submits to an experimental program involving Cortisone supplements... medication doctors didn't know much about at the time.  At first it makes him feel great and he starts to take too many trying to maintain that uphoria... but then psychosis kicks in and this guy undergoes great personality changes... much to his family's dismay.  he becomes an abusive troll.  His family and friends and work tolerate it... until he hits rock bottom.

The ending knocked off a star... meh. Way too tidy.  I also tried to watch it pretending I hadn't heard this story of downward spiral drug addiction before because I'm sure it was much more original in its time.  But I don't think it's aged well for this reason.  Very Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  And still, a very interesting study of film.  Excellent acting.  And interestingly, it's based on a true story once published in The New Yorker called ""Ten Feet Tall about a guy who went through the same deal.  Sad and weird.

It's worth a watch but I'm not likely to watch it again.",1522195200,,1572,4.540925266903915

I would say, though, that it is kind of for either Mason or cinema buffs--not sure how enjoyable it would be for general audiences (the science stuff is pretty dated).",1516752000,,285,4.72

8115253,5,B000EX9U0E,"""Bigger Than Life""  is an American indictment pitched somewhere between Douglas Sirk's melodramas and Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"".  As the first film to show how pharmaceuticals could be as insidious as alcohol to the American dream,  it apparently didn't resonate with the public, but the passage of time has revealed its incisiveness.

Director Nicholas Ray allowed actor James Mason a wide berth in the creation of this picture.  Mason served as producer, and apparently was allowed to make suggestions for the script.  Mason and Ray wisely steered away from histrionics, making sure that the film was not a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" carnival of horrors, or paranoid alarmism about a hidden threat to society.

Instead, a subtle drama unfolds about a relatively happy suburban nuclear family, with stable father who is apparently content to be an elementary school teacher, even though the worldly destinations plastered on the walls of his home may indicate some thwarted ambitions.  When Mason's character, Ed Avery, suddenly is debilitated by an unknown malady, the family stability is under siege.  A battery of hospital tests determines that a rare arterial inflammation is present, but a new treatment is available with an experimental drug.

Avery responds splendidly to his treatment with this new wonder drug; in fact he soon feels ""ten feet tall"".  In fairly short order, Avery becomes dependent on the drug, which distorts his judgment and invests him with a new grandiosity.  Soon, he is muttering about ""petty domesticity"" and seeing himself as a man of destiny who has made the mistake of ""marrying beneath him.""  As the psychosis deepens, Avery's newfound megalomania turns murderously evil.

Some viewers may not be happy with the ""sunny meadows and happy music"" redemption of the ending (very Sirkian)---but this is a movie that, for its time, took huge risks.  Other personality-altering drugs besides cortisone were soon to be introduced to America ( barbituates, valium), and in the present day, opioids have become an epidemic.  It would be a while before another movie depicted an out-of-control father with as much harrowing intensity--- perhaps ""The Great Santini"" comes closest.

If you haven't seen ""Bigger Than Life"", it's definitely one to put on your bucket list.",1493596800,,2297,5.23224043715847

8115257,5,B000EX9U0E,I wished that I had seen this movie when I became steroid dpendent over 30 years ago.  It would have explained a lot of what my doctors failed to explain to me in order to understand my behavior over these past decades.,1431734400,,219,4.214285714285714
8115258,3,B000EX9U0E,"Outside of a rather remarkable (and convincing) performance from James Mason, there was a lot about Bigger than Life I felt needed some better direction, or a better writer.  While the concept is one that is surely interesting (man dying of a rare disease gets a new lot on life when he takes a miracle drug with some odd side effects), the execution of that premise isn't up to par.  The writing is essentially lazy and never really colors in the aspects of the plot that needed some extra help, and the supporting cast, most notably Barbara Rush, isn't really up to Masons ferocity and so they fail to make much of an impact.  Rush does sell her big scene in the bathroom though, Ill give her that.  The speedy decline into madness that overtakes Masons character here isn't really fleshed out enough to make a real impact, and once he starts spouting Biblical denouncements I found myself wondering why they hadnt tried harder to make this all make sense.  The finale was far too swift and lazy to be credible, but at least we got to see Mason chew some scenery, and chew he does!  I will give Ray this, his finale is expertly crafted, from a tension standpoint, so even if the abrupt closure feels forced, the build up to settled nicely.",1402012800,,1241,4.517857142857143
