It certainly  did not hurt her to be in ""costumes by Adrian.""  Fabulous, threadbare as it may be, is the word here for her!  Contrary to what I have read, she was quite understandable, making the comments about her being ""unitelligible because of her thick, Polish accent"" seem like gibberish!  She had a bit more accent than Greta Garbo, but there was no problem in being able to understand what she uttered.  She was clearly comfortable in comedic and dramatic roles.  This one is fluff, but fluff that was well executed.  She also was comfortable with the generational jokes being tossed her direction, and handled that with the grace and aplomb one expects from a professional.  It will never rival Gone With The Wind, but it's fun, and a must-see for Pola Negri fans!",1272844800,2,1048,5.5

The problem--Menjou is more of a con man  living off a dole from his opera-star wife.  Script is weak, but has its  moments.  I especially like Billie Burke practicing her double-takes.  This  movie, while a pleasant comedy, is not up to O'Keefe's inspired roles in  the original Brewster's Millions and Up in Mabel's Room.",953856000,6,497,4.963414634146342

2128509,4,B0002W4TR6,"HI DIDDLE DIDDLE (1943) is a delightful screwball comedy with a most unusual cast:
Adolphe Menjou, Martha Scott, Pola Negri, Dennis O'Keefe, Billie Burke and June Havoc.
Among the uncrediteds are Bess Flowers, Don Brodie and Lou Costello's pal, Bobby Barber.

This was silent era star Negri's next-to-last film, Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MOON-SPINNERS/dp/B00007GZZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MOON-SPINNERS</a>&nbsp;(1964) being her final movie.
Here she's hilarious as a pompous Wagnerian opera diva with a voice that penetrates your head like a nail.

Whenever Madame Genya Smetana starts to warble, Adolphe Menjou (as Col. Hector Phyffe, an elegant con man)
finds a way to escape the noisy onslaught. The colonel's son, played by Dennis O'Keefe, is marrying Martha Scott,
the daughter of scatterbrained society dame Billie Burke, who confesses that she's been swindled out of 50K.
Menjou is determined to get back this money that was lost at a crooked gambling joint and he enlists the aid
of June Havoc, a tall, exotic-looking club singer/dancer.

Watch for Havoc's spotlight moment when she stands next to a 7 foot tall Panoram, a big screen TV-like coin-fed
contraption that shows musical film clips on demand. June backs up a singing ""Soundie"" of herself with some jazzy
harmony and footwork.

Perhaps the best technical gimmick comes at the end. Negri screeches, Menjou winces and illustrations that are
duplicated dozens of times on the wallpaper come to life and all run away simultaneously. A fine end to a fun picture!

The cast makes the most of some sharp dialogue by Bob Hope's long-time scriptwriter Edmund L. Hartmann.
Director Andrew L. Stone may be best known for the musical he worked on just prior to this film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STORMY-WEATHER/dp/B000BOH922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STORMY WEATHER</a>

2128510,5,B0002W4TR6,"What a cute movie! The comic timing in this movie is hilarious. I laughed out loud several times. Adolphe Menjou steals the show. Reprising his Cafe Metropole lovable-scoundrel skills, I couldn't help but be charmed by him. Great performances and a winning script make this movie a joy from beginning to end.
