3495128,5,B001BN4WHW,"I was worried that due to copyrights and music rights issues that this DVD set would not feature the popular theme song and incidental music all the fans expect to hear. Thankfully, Paramount/CBS Home Video and Paul Henning's estate must have worked out their problems because the original music is there!

The epiosdes I have watched so far all have a length of over 25 minutes, so, as far as I can tell the episodes are unedited. And the picture quality looks good enough to me.

Since Paul Henning's Estate still owns the rights to the first season and part of the second season (as I understand it), I was wondering how Paramount would release the second season. Eventually, I learned that this set would be the complete second season, so I knew going in that this set would have some repeats carried over from the ""Ultimate Collection"" put out about two years ago. But most of the shows haven't been released on DVD before (to my knowledge).

If you are a fan, pick up the set. Hopefully, sales will warrant Paramount releasing all the seasons on DVD in the near-future.",1223424000,9,1075,4.617801047120419
3495129,5,B001BN4WHW,"With so many recent releases being comprised of incomplete and altered versions of our beloved classic TV shows, it's smart to wait and decide to purchase (or not) well after the release date. It seems that the firestorms of complaint following releases such as THE FUGITIVE SEASON TWO VOL. ONE have been noticed, at least for the time being. I must say that THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES OFFICIAL SECOND SEASON set is of far higher quality than I expected. Yes, this is the complete second season, with excellent picture (a bit grainy at times, but overall superb) and sound transfers of every episode...but most important, the episodes are complete and with the original music as far as I can tell. It's nice to see a good bit of bonus material here too; the original sponsor opening and closings are great segments that have been lost to time over the years. Some of the closing segments are continuations of the episodes themselves and extend the episodes by several minutes; for example, the third episode, ""Granny's Garden"", runs 29 minutes with the sponsor segments added back in. This is nice stuff, and really adds to the value!

Don't hesitate to order this fine DVD set. Just as companies should be boycotted when they mangle releases, they should also be praised and supported when they make the effort to do things right. I don't think anyone will be disappointed with THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES OFFICIAL SECOND SEASON, and I hope that this high quality is maintained as a standard in future releases.",1223424000,99,1505,4.856031128404669
3495130,4,B001BN4WHW,"Here's the deal on the ""official"" second season release.  Paramount owns the distribution rights to the entire ""Beverly Hillbillies"" series. It holds control over the 35mm network prints of the series that were used in the 1960's.  Hillbillies creator Paul Henning also legally owned the rights to the first 55 episodes of the series.  That's all of season one and most of season two.  About two years ago, his estate released those 55 episodes in two volumes. Unfortunately, because Paramount owns the negatives and master prints, MPI video(which distributed the Henning sets) only had access to film prints which were struck decades ago. These episodes contained original network sponsor sketches, etc, but they were grainy and barely watchable. Paramount apparently figured that most fans who purchased volume one of the Henning series, wouldn't be motivated to purchase it again.  So they began with the ""official"" second season, with intentions of re-releasing season one at a later date (like they did with I Love Lucy). So, what are you getting by purchasing this ""official"" season?  First, you'll get *all* the season two episodes, remastered from the original film prints. That means no scratches, lines, debris or picture shifting.  Paramount is excellent in restoring picture quality.  However, it remains to be seen whether Paramount will use all the original music.  Much of it was composed by Paul Henning, & there may have been some royalty issues. Paramount has been hesitant to use incidental music that it doesn't hold legal right to in its DVD releases.  Also, the artwork on season two is horrendous.
Season two spanned 1963-64. The cover photo is from a 1969 episode (Jethro has sideburns for cying out loud!). Very VERY tacky artwork.",1223251200,26,1756,5.151408450704225
3495131,5,B001BN4WHW,"One of the funniest shows of all time finally gets the treatment it deserves - Season Sets.  All of the first season and half of the second season has already been put out by MPI, but they used 16mm transfers that are of an inferior quality.  The MPI sets are still worth picking up however for the shows, an wealth of incredible special features.  The Beverly Hillbillies got Nielson ratings that shows of today could only dream about.  This is one of the few shows from that era that make me laugh as much today as when I first saw them 40 years ago.  Please don't rate the show based on Paramount's treatment of the Fugitive - for the most part Paramount has done a tremendous job releasing many of these classic series from my youth.",1223078400,5,737,4.389705882352941
3495132,4,B001BN4WHW,"Unfortunately CBS/Paramount is notorius for editing music (and in some cases, cutting out entire scenes) on their TV DVDs. Or replacing music. Check out ""THE ODD COUPLE"", ""GOMER PYLE; U.S.M.C."", ""THE FUGITIVE"", and other shows. But not all-like seson 1 of ""THE ODD COUPLE"", and season 1 of ""THE FUGITIVE"".

After waiting a long time for this, the packaging alone is disastrous. After reading a few of the reviews regarding Paramount, I'll pass even though I love the Hillbillies.

3495148,5,B001BN4WHW,"I received my copy of The Beverly Hillbillies The Official Second Season, and I am delighted. The episodes contain the original sponsor openings and closings, which doesn't bother me. But Winston Cigarettes was one of the sponsors, so to rabid anti-smokers I recommend you pass up on this item. Crisp clear picture and audio. As a devoted fan, I love all of them, and loved the humor and zany antics of Granny and her still and Country remedies as well as her peculiar brand of vittles like possum innards and hog jowls. ""The Giant Jackrabbit"" was absolutely one of the funniest sitcom episodes of all time. All 36 episodes of season 2 are on this set along with Irene Ryan's screen test for the role of Granny, and an interview with Paul Henning the creator of The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres, an interview from 1969. Once again Amazon was prompt in their delivery, and everything checked out. A true fan of The Beverly Hillbillies cannot miss out on this set. They all contain the original Flatt and Scruggs theme song The Ballad of Jed Clampett, and have not been replaced by secondary alternate music. A great show.

3495240,5,B001BN4WHW,"THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES-THE OFFICIAL SECOND SEASON: Series creator PAUL HENNING's broad take off on JOHN STEINBECK's classic GRAPES OF WRATH is one of the most familiar yarns in all of TV land. As detailed in blue grass legends FLATT & SCRUGGs' irresistible theme song, a poor mountain family strikes oil, pulls up roots and becomes the hayseed toast of the west coast. The ""fish out of water"" clan included easy going matriarch JED CLAMPETT (BUDDY EBSON), excitable, vittles rustling GRANNY (scene stealer IRENE RYAN), critter lovin' tomboy ELLY MAE (DONNA DOUGLAS), and sixth grade educated oaf JETHRO (MAX BAER); collectively, they misunderstood virtually everything from doorbells and pool tables to scuba diving and health clubs. Money mad banker MILBURN DRYSDALE (RAYMOND BAILEY) stopped at nothing to keep the Clampett fortune secure in his vault, assisted by his long suffering secretary JANE HATHAWAY (NANCY KULP), a prim and proper OLIVE OYL who held an unrequited torch for JETHRO. Reviled by critics but loved by legions of fans, THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES was as much rib-tickling fun as a square-dance hootenanny down by the ""cement pond"".

3495265,5,B001BN4WHW,"You have to be pretty ancient to remember the Beverly Hillbillies.  I'm 50, and even I can't remember it not being a re-run.  But it is fantastic TV, and still has me laughing out loud which many of today's shows fail to do.  If you know the show, I really don't need to explain it, but briefly, it's the classic ""fish out of water"" storyline.  Take a bunch of Hillbillies out of an old shack in the Hills, and take them to snobby, wealthy, Beverly Hills.  Plenty of mis-understandings along the way, and money-grabbing Milburn Drysdale is a wonderful character (who seem to have been a man ahead of his time - he'd have been a role model for the world of banking in the 200?s & 201?s).  Plus the wisdom of Jed, innocence of Ellie May, determination of Granny, and the air-head that is Jethro.  Very strong characters, and quality writing.

Compared to similar series, the Beverly Hillbillies tends to be quite expensive.  This is Series 2, and at the time of writing, Series 1 was no longer available, and Series 3 is quite pricey.  Series 2 is good value at the moment (May 2013), so perhaps get it while you can before they archive it and move to Series 4.",1369526400,3,1159,4.4245283018867925

The razor blade marks indicate that these were sets that were designated as screeners for TV on DVD reviewers such as myself.

I initially bought a $10.99 set through Amazon partner Best Bargains Inc., which I found to be a bad company that uses the EXACT same name as an entirely separate wholesale grocery and probably is not even incorporated. The rep's response was largely that he charges so little because he sells seconds. He was very difficult!

I then bought a roughly $30 copy from Amazon, which made up the $20 difference. That one was marked as badly as the other. Amazon's replacement of the replacement was just as bad.

3495287,5,B001BN4WHW,"The Beverly Hillbillies Official Second Season DVD is another wonderful set of these classic episodes of the CBS TV series that ran for nine seasons from 1962-1971. This set features the complete 36 episodes of the second season with all the sponsorships and cast commercials that were a part of this phenomenal TV series. Not only that, those sponsorships and cast commercials are very much historic and for those discovering these episodes for the first time in their original way, like myself, they will get a very unique experience.

Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD both do a wonderful job on this set of 36 episodes from the 1963-1964 TV season. The episodes of the series look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were originally shown. They are all here in their original glory.

Each and every episode has been digitally remastered from original negatives and from other sources that both Paramount and CBS DVD had obtained to give us a superb and superior quality set that also makes mincemeat out of any of those public domain DVD sets that came out after the DVD boom took off. Each and everything about this classic show is all there the way that they were originally shown and had been rerun in syndication over the many years.

The original theme song, The Ballad Of Jed Clampett, is included on the episodes of this series. As stated, you also have the sponsorships and the cast commercials that were originally with the show when first run. You do have the option to watch the episodes with or without the sponsorships or cast commercials, but I have been watching these episodes with the sponsorships and cast commercials for nostalgic and historic purposes. This is one of the best sets of this classic TV show that has been released on DVD with the Official Third Season and MPI's Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 & 2 and it's companion DVD MPI's Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Christmas Collection alongside this.

Overall, this is one of the finest collections of The Beverly Hillbillies TV series that nobody who loves this show should be without. This should be in every fans DVD library.",1326499200,,2132,4.832876712328767

Granny plays her own icon as a Hoot Gibson dance hall 'girl'. But, it is Elly Mae that left a life long impression on me as Venus Adore, a sure knock off of Marilyn Monroe who had recently passed. She emotes as a method actress. pretending to be a tree, she looks into the camera with a wide eyed very Marilyn look, it is really chilling and somewhat unsettling, here we have Monroe all over again, almost.

3495298,4,B001BN4WHW,"Like Jed Clampett, writer Paul Henning unexpectedly struck it rich, when he created The Beverly Hillbillies (1962-71), a program that was a ratings winner for nearly a decade, and spawned Henning's rural based spinoffs Petticoat Junction (1963-70), and Green Acres (1965-1971).

The Beverly Hillbillies took an interesting premise, and executed it brilliantly, transporting a family of hillbillies from their mountain cabin, to a mansion in Beverly Hills.  The resulting culture clash produced high hilarity for many years, and the series was still going strong when CBS cancelled it in 1971.

After being around in the first season, Cousin Pearl (Bea Benaderet) and her daughter Jethrine have gone back home.  Season Two finds the Clampetts on their own and doing well in their spacious mansion, that is also home to pet hound dog Duke, and Elly May's (Donna Douglas) many critters.  Pearl's son Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) has remained with his uncle, and is busy with school, chores, and trying to pick up girls (literally).  While still planning to become a brain surgeon, Jethro is often drawn to other vocations.  Levelheaded Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen) is unphased by almost anything that happens in the modern world.  His sage wisdom and steady hand keeps the clan together.  Jed may be a ""grizzled old mountain goat"", but he still has an interest in courting the ladies.  Granny (Irene Ryan) remains as volatile and cantankerous as ever, railing against the wanton ways of city folk, and whatever else she finds offensive.  Her pastimes include cooking, making tonic, and doctoring.

The buffer between the Clampett's bucolic bliss and modern everyday life is often banker Milburn Drysdale (Raymond Bailey), and his studious secretary Jane Hathaway (Nancy Kulp).  Drysdale, the president of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills, will do almost anything to keep Jed's millions in his bank, including having his biggest depositor as his next door neighbor, much to the consternation of his society conscious wife Margaret (Harriet MacGibbon).  In the second season the focus is on the four hillbillies, the Drysdales, and Miss Jane.  Once the personalities of these core characters was firmly established, they remained essentially the same throughout the series.

Image quality and sound quality is quite good, but abrupt or messy edits make is clear that material has been cut from various episodes.  It's regrettable, but something that has unfortunately become all too common.  Television in those days was something of a grind, as season two contains 36 episodes on five discs.  To help ""fill out"" the season, the stories often featured guest stars that appear in a couple of episodes, leisurely stretching things out.  Lafe Crick (Peter Whitney), a visitor from back home is featured in multiple episodes, always scheming to get Jed's money.

The season contains some memorable stories and funny gags.  One episode involves an escaped kangaroo that Granny believes is a giant jackrabbit.  She even has a boxing match with the marsupial, in an attempt to capture it.  In ""The Clampetts Go Hollywood"", Jethro emulates Marlon Brando, and Granny and Elly also have dreams of getting into the movies, until Jed shows up in a glitter suit and a double neck guitar, to show them how foolish they look.  In another episode, Granny takes a wild ride in the family truck, trying to learn how to drive, as the Clampett mansion is mistaken for a mental asylum.  The mysterious crustaceans known as crawdads create a stir on Wall Street and also among some of the bank's investors.  Jed becomes the owner of a boutique, and later sends Elly May there to learn more about being a lady.  Granny gets hooked on watching TV, and predicts the weather using a ladybug, while Jethro finds academic success, managing to complete the sixth grade in just twelve years.

Perhaps the most ruckus is stirred up when Mr. Drysdale has a cabin installed in the Clampett's backyard as a birthday present for Granny.  The Clampetts are mistaken for servants working in serfdom, in an example of pure comic madness.  The appearance of the cabin is a stroke of pure genius, creating a whole new set of comedic opportunities, as the season winds down with banker Drysdale chained to the shack to keep it from being torn down.

One of the true strengths of the series is a rock solid creative team that soon became masters at this particular brand of humor.  Paul Henning and Mark Tuttle wrote almost of the episodes in season two, with Richard Whorf doing most of the directing.  The humor is almost never crude, and if fact was often quite sophisticated, often turning on a word with a dual meaning, or perhaps a name or a phrase that is misunderstood.  It goes without saying that the show's fantastic cast was also a major contributor to the success of the series.  Everyone is outstanding, but Irene Ryan, Raymond Bailey, Nancy Kulp, and Buddy Ebsen (Barnaby Jones), are particularly outstanding.

In an interesting but very sad note, Sharon Tate (The Wrecking Crew) appears as Janet Trego, a secretary at the Commerce Bank who assists Jane Hathaway.  Tate, who would later marry director Roman Polanski, was tragically murdered while pregnant, by the Manson family in 1969.  Janet is one of Jethro's early love interests, and most of her appearances in the series, occur during this season.

Although many critics panned the series, The Beverly Hillbillies became one of the most popular TV comedies ever, cleverly poking fun at various facets of modern culture.  For those unfamiliar with the 60's rural comedy genre, this is a fine place to start.  Unfortunately most of the cast and creative team have passed on, but this set serves as a warm remembrance of that very special period in time.",1297468800,3,5776,4.9989539748953975

The option to play each episode with or without the original sponsor intros/outros is a great bonus.

3495309,5,B001BN4WHW,"I don't have to mention how good this show is. The fact that many older TV programs don't get rerun as much as this program speaks volumes. Small note of interest. Original negatives are in 35 mm format. To make a transfer from the original negatives is expensive, not to mention valuable. After all, if the original negatives are destroyed or damaged, part of our film history is lost. Decades ago the episodes were transferred from the 35 mm masters to what is known as 3-quarter format, also known as broadcast quality. For decades the episodes have been on VHS and TV repeatedly referred to from the 3-quarter masters. This prevents any chance of damage to the original 35 mm reels.

Now some episodes have fallen into the public domain, so dollar store DVDs have put them available on disc but since the music is still copyrighted, they replaced the theme music with generic non-copyrighted music. Shame on them. Course, the consumers get what they paid for.

Good news and rejoice! This DVD set ""The Official Second Season"" was mastered from the original 35 mm masters! Yes, that means the quality is as good as it is ever going to get. All 36 episodes and with their original music score. After all, could we really watch these without that zingy ""Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed . . ."" I bought one of the public domain DVDs once and not hearing the familiar theme song was distracting with each viewing.

This set not only has the superb transfer quality prints using today's technology from the 35 mm masters, but the extras are nice. Irene Ryan screen test as Granny, a clip from ""The Stars' Address is CBS"" (1963 fall preview show), the 1963/64 CBS Network Promo, and the Paul Henning Interview from 1969.

3495311,5,B001BN4WHW,"Despite one serious flaw (discussed below), this set is well worth buying and should be supported wholeheartedly by all BH fans.  We vote for a product (whether good or bad) by purchasing it, which we hope encourages the bigwigs to continue to produce it.  There are nine seasons of this show, all of which deserve to be released on DVD, so we have a long way to go.  We don't want this show to suffer the fate of ""Green Acres"" (which the bigwigs stopped releasing after three of six seasons, presumably due to lack of sales).  So buy it not only for its own sake and the enjoyment you will surely derive from owning it, but also as an investment in the future release of the other seasons in the series.

This show is a true classic, one of the all time greats.  It holds the world's record for the most highly rated single episode of a sitcom ever broadcast (the episode entitled, ""The Giant Jackrabbit"", which is contained in this set).  The scripts are well written with witty and hilarious dialog and loveable characters.  This show is also genuinely FUNNY, with no hidden agenda to convert the viewer to leftist ideology like today's TV shows.  Also unlike today's TV, no attempt is made here to defile the innocence of any defenseless children who may be in the room, so you may safely allow your kids to view this show (and they will love it!).

Even if you already own both volumes of the BH Ultimate Collection (which you should), this set is still worth having since it includes 17 episodes from season two not previously released.  The sound and picture quality of the episodes on this set is quite good.  The length of the episodes varies, the shortest being 25:07 and the longest coming in at 25:36.  Average length overall is 25:22, thus they can reasonably be thought to be free of edits.

Extras include an Irene Ryan screen test/comparison with an excerpt from the pilot episode (1:16), ""The Stars Address is CBS"" 1963 fall preview spot (2:33, but you can tell it is edited, they cut out the Twilight Zone segment), a CBS network promo spot from 1963 (0:46), and an excerpt from a 1969 Paul Henning interview (2:39, also edited.  Part, though not all, of this interview is included in the BH Ultimate Collection Vol. II).

But the greatest extra of all, and the one that makes this set so much worth buying, is the inclusion of some of the CAST COMMERCIALS!!  While the previously released BH Ultimate Collections also (fortunately) contained the cast commercials (some of which are duplicated here), this set also contains a few not found on the previous BHUC releases.  Also very convenient here is that the menu provides an option to watch each episode in it's entirety with the CC's integrated into the episode as they were intended to be seen, instead of just lumping them altogether at the end of disc 4 as with the previously released Ultimate Collection sets.

On a brand new DVD release we already expect full, complete, unedited episodes (and factually speaking they are not truly complete unless they include the cast commercials), with good sound and picture quality.  That much is a given; anything less and the bigwigs can take a flying leap and forget about getting my hard earned money.  But the inclusion of the cast commercials takes any DVD set to a whole new level.  We've all seen these episodes before (in edited form) on network/cable TV, and we know how enjoyable they are.  But what you will never see on TV are these awesome Cast Commercials, which feature the characters from the show hawking the sponsor's products in very clever and witty spots which often continue the story line of the episodes.  These things are great!!  It really is all about the cast commercials, the inclusion of which here is the single best of many good reasons to buy this set.

Which brings me to its one shameful flaw.  There are 36 episodes (the complete 2nd season) on this set, so there should have also been 36 cast commercials on it.  Instead, there are 11 missing, NINE of which (and here we come to the shameful part) are the Winston cigarette commercials (the commercials alternate each week between the show's two sponsors, Winston and Kelloggs).  Specifically, the ONLY Winston commercials present on this set are the SAME ONES that were already released on the BHUC sets (the fact that they are to be found on a competitor's set is doubtless the only reason they were included on this set).  So the powers that be deliberately cut out the remaining Winston commercials, apparently afraid that if they let us watch 40 year old Winston cigarette commercials we all will take up smoking (I don't smoke, never have, and no amount of persuasion is going to make me start.  I'm not nearly as weak minded as the bigwigs think I am).  Or more likely they just lack the moral courage to stand up and do the right thing for their customers and for posterity, it being easier to just cave in and sell out to the political correctness thought police (doesn't it make you feel good to know there are people out there smarter and better than we are, who care so much about our safety and welfare that they are willing to protect us from ourselves and make our decisions for us since we are all just a bunch of ignorant hicks and simplistic little children?).  They even went so far in their cowardice as to put little mandatory blurbs at the beginning of the Winston episodes (even the ones which have had the commercials cut out) warning about the dangerous evils of smoking (I agree that smoking is not the smartest way to spend your time or money, but that is still something adults have the right to decide for themselves, without holier-than-thou paternalistic busybodies attempting to dictate and force their personal preferences on the rest of us).

Indeed a shame that what could have been a great release is marred by moral cowardice and lack of principle.  Even so, to have some cast commercials is better than to have none.  Hopefully future releases of BH will be at least as good as this one, if not better (i.e., they will include ALL the cast commercials, not just the ones that the political correctness stormtroopers deem ""acceptable"").  So buy it for yourself, for your friends and relatives, for anyone who needs a good laugh, or for anyone who could benefit from having their cultural horizons expanded.",1226016000,18,6346,4.669362084456424
3495312,5,B001BN4WHW,"Having already owned these episodes as released by MPI from Paul Henning's personal 16mm prints, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Paramount's release.

I was thrilled to see that not only are the original sponsor openings and cast commercials included, but you have the option of watching with them INTEGRATED INTO THE SHOW via seamless branching!  That's a feature even the ""Ultimate Collection"" couldn't boast... there, the sponsor clips were available only in a supplemental section.

The prints are much better here, too, with the exception of the opening and closing credits, which appear to be sourced from Henning's 16mm prints.  Nonetheless, Parmount did a tremendous job on this release.

What a thrill to watch these episodes EXACTLY as originally broadcast.  And what a trip, in our politically correct age, to see the Hillibillies actually smoking!

Thanks, Paramount, for not insulting our intellect by ""deciding for us"" what is or is not appropriate to watch.",1224979200,71,980,5.203821656050955
3495313,5,B001BN4WHW,"...there is much to enjoy about the release of this Official Second Season (1963-1964).

I did submit to Amazon to change the format in the product listing to ""black & white"" rather than ""color"" as they have it described at the moment, since this season was filmed entirely in black & white and perhaps not everyone would know that (or think the releasing studio had colorized these disks).

*EDITED OCTOBER 30:  I see Amazon did finally change the format to black & white for this set, so that is good to know there is less likely to be any potential for confusion.*

Since there is as of today not a listing of episodes contained in this set, I thought I would type the titles of all 36 full-length episodes (especially as there is apparently some cross-over for those buyers of the various collections regarding episodes...).

3495314,5,B001BN4WHW,"Well as much as I,am happy with the Beverly Hillbillies complete second season,as owners of the rights to the show they defiately should have put out the complete season 1. MPI only owned the rights for 1 year to produce the collections featuring season 1 and 2 so that should not stand in Paramounts way. I love MPI,s treatment of Dark Shadows but the Beverly Hillbillies was not given the justice it deserved. Now I hear they might place this show in seasons on Blue Ray I hope this will stop and both versions released at same time so we don't have to buy both versions only the one we want.

3495315,5,B001BN4WHW,"This is what I have been waiting for. I read the other reviews and I wasn't going to get this. I am glad that I got them on impulse. The theme music is intact. Also there are alternative original openings. The copies were very clear. Nothing was cut out. I saw seconds that I had never seen before, plus all the original closings. It is a great trip back to 1963 in a time machine. thank you to whoever put these out. If you are a fan of Jed and all his kin this is for you. I can't wait for season 3, my particular favorite.",1223769600,8,525,3.9622641509433962
3495316,5,B001BN4WHW,"Hello
I must admit that I will probably own this Hillbillies set later in the week. I have already given it 5 stars just from judging the reviews here and I do have both Ultimate Collections which I also rate 5 stars. I am wondering if anyone that has written reviews on this or anyone reading these can maybe give me some insight on this--- Green Acres was my favorite show from back then. Also produced by Paul Henning. I taped all of them on tv on video when they ran them in syndication so I was drooling when I first saw them coming out on dvd. It seemed to take forever for each of the 3 seasons to come out but 3 seasons are out there. It has been since late 2005 when season 3 of Green Acres was released. The best and funniest episodes were just around the corner and all of a sudden, MGM doesnt release anymore of the last 3 seasons. Does anyone know what their problem is or does someone else own Green Acres now? Us Green Acres fans want to know what the problem is so if anyone has any insight, post something here please. We want more Hillbillies sets and more Green Acres. Thanks.
Joey",1223683200,5,1100,4.193396226415095
3495317,5,B001BN4WHW,"The second season set from Paramount is sooooo much improved over the MPI Volumes 1 & 2. I can't believe i had something nice to say regarding Paramount.

 I never thought i would see it this clear and that is viewing it on my large screen LCD tv which sometimes makes older shows seem a little more off or grainey.  I also tested a disc in my player hooked up to my 36 inch glass screen tv and it seems nice and clear without any real noticeable grainey quality.

This is such an improvement over MPI and those horrible other sets that were out there prior. This was one of my very favorite shows growing up. I was so sad to think all we'd ever see are episodes in the previous quality of the MPI sets.

While the episodes are remastered the opening and closing credits are not. One feature is the option to view each episode with or without the original sponsor opening and closing. The sponsor opening extends the scene with all four driving in the truck while passing a truck or billboard with the Winston cigarettes or Kelloggs cereals logo on it. It also has extended theme lyrics mentioning one of the two sponsors. The closing is actually a short scene wrapping up the episode while having the Clampetts using one of the products in the scene. Unfortunately the sponsor closings are not remastered.

 As far as the music, it plays the original theme song (with original vocalist) exactly as how we remembered it. Also i noticed that the regular intro music you would hear in the beginning of a scene is also the original music. So maybe the music that is altered pertains to performances of songs on the show or something along that line.

Seven of the episodes in season 2 have Sharon Tate wearing a black wig playing the part of Janet Trego, a bank secretary. In one episode ""The Garden Party"" she plays a guest at the party who dances with Jethro with her own blonde hair. She also appears in the ""Elly Starts To School"" episode as a ""blink and you'll miss her"" character named Mary. While it's nice to see her....it makes me sad at the same time.

If you are true fan of this show and was disheartened like i was with prior sets you'll want to pick this set up. I'm so glad i did!

 Welllll doggies....it's time for me to have a heapin' helpin' of vittles in a Jethro sized bowl and set a spell with the Clampetts!",1223424000,44,2326,4.386046511627907
