8316331,3,B001KWC8WU,This is a good movie to add to your collection ... but the actual running scenes are not as good as they could be ... if you have not competed as a runner you will probably not notice ... for those of you who have run then you will tell her running form is not world class ... and probably is just speeded up film ... the story is a sad but spiritual one ... I'm glad I have the movie as it is good to talk about death and dying ... and since I run and coach running ... and I am a Christian ... I like having the movie ... peace ...,1248048000,,533,3.6842105263157894
