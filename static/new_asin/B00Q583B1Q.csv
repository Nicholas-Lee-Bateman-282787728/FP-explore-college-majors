6854306,4,B00Q583B1Q,"If you're watching this documentary, you're probably already familiar with most of the stories dramatized in this film, including some of the more famous ones: the Hobby Lobby lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act's mandated contraceptive coverage and the baker in Oregon who refused to bake a wedding for a homosexual's wedding ceremony.  In essence, this film is mainly a summary of sorts of all the recent religious liberty wars that have engulfed America as of late.  As a person who tends to follow this subject, this documentary didn't necessarily tell me anything new but it was nice to see it dramatized for film.  I would say this movie is more of a way to bring awareness to this issue and it would be perfect to share with churches, family members or friends who need to be enlightened about the religious liberty battle going on in America today.  The movie then ends with a nice call to action for all Americans who want to see Americas religious freedoms restored.

Overall, the movie is definitely worth the buy and even if only affirms what you already know it can be a great tool to help others understand the issues as well.",1429401600,12,1144,4.7

8690381,1,B00Q583B1Q,"Full of myths, as is usually, wait, strike that, always the case with Christian right-wing writers and producers. For example, in San Diego there is a giant cross on federal land (a huge promotion of Christianity) that those who support keeping the Govt from endorsing religion (such as the ACLU)  pointed out is unconstitutional. Mike Huckabee than creates a strawman argument that this will lead to the Govt striking down individual crosses in Arlington cemetery, forgetting that those crosses (or more accurately the cross symbols on individual tombstones) reflect individuals & not all the veterans as a group. Huckabee also strongly implies that if the Govt isn't putting up giant crosses on federal land, somehow that intrudes on his ability as a Christian to practice his religion. Of course Huckabee would be supportive of giant Islamic crescents on federal land....wait, strike that, he would scream bloody murder if that happened. So to sum up more far rightwing propaganda by the Christian rightwing, who do not in anyway represent the average Christian.",1480809600,,1065,5.228070175438597
