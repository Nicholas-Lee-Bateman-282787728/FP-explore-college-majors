8446937,5,B004XH9X6S,Great flick...can't beat a film with Robert Loggia..and he was intense. The plot was well crafted and the cast was great. I enjoyed it and thought the research into what art forgery really is or can be is scary....,1384905600,,214,4.512820512820513
8446938,4,B004XH9X6S,"I enjoyed this film.  I bought it because I personally know one of the actors (small part but effective!!)  I was pleasantly surprised that It also starred one of my ""Revenge"" series actors.  I rarely go to the movies but my friends who do go also liked this movie.",1379030400,,265,4.36734693877551
8446939,5,B004XH9X6S,"Great storyline, excellent acting.  Very many scenes shot in my home town of ""Hard Hittin"" New Britain.  Well written storyline, leaves you asking the age old question ""is this real or a very accurate reproduction"".  Gotta love the actor portraying the art expert, he did a great job.  Very well directed, definitely a must see...check it out...you won't be disappointed...",1337817600,,373,5.166666666666667
8446940,5,B004XH9X6S,"This movie got off to a bit of a slow start, but that was mainly to put all the pieces together in what turned out to be a suspenseful story of forgery and the dark side of the art world. Yes, you can fool a lot of the people a lot of the time time, but you can only fake it for so long, before you get caught, right?

A fun watch.",1332547200,,331,3.5972222222222223
8446941,4,B004XH9X6S,"Daniel (Gabriel Mann) is a struggling artist. His girlfriend (Jill Flint) thinks he is great, but the art community has left him behind. His critics claim his original works copy the styles of other artist. His despair is artificially heightened by a much too loud violin soundtrack. However, in the real criminal world, being able to reproduce the brush strokes of famous artists has a certain amount of commericial value.

His girlfriend is not enthusiastic about the whole forgery thing. The movie attempts to make us pity poor poor Daniel with a pathetic soundtrack as he produces fakes and sells for healthy profit. Seriously? They go out of their way to try to make us feel sorry for a guy who is going to forge paintings because he lacks the love and support of his girlfriend (also in the art business). Spielberg cleverly made me all teary eyed when Darth Vader died, but an arrogant artist who we don't like anyway? Who is Friedle trying to kid? Super rich snobbish art collectors getting ripped off by fake paintings. Not even with violin music could this break my heart. Gabriel Mann does some first person narration on the noble history of art forgery. Where is the director supposed to be going with this?

In a subplot Tay Murphy (David Thornton) who wears his hair like Judd Nelson in ""The Breakfast Club"" is a dishonest art gallery owner and gambler way down on his luck. Like the cavalry, these Irish bad guys rescue the film from being a lame indie flop.

Like most artists, Daniel's biggest flaw is his ego. He has a small almost secret cross star that he inserts into all of his paintings. Good acting by the support cast. In the beginning the film seems like it is an Indy docudrama taken from a 60 minutes episode.

The film picks up when the jazz starts to play. The ending was a bit awkward. It appears that the writer painted himself into a corner and couldn't get out without cliche mobster antics.

F-bombs, no real sex- just some rolling around in bed, no nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1332547200,4,2004,4.602240896358543
8446942,5,B004XH9X6S,"""Is this thing real?""  It's a question that's often asked in natural history museums, but most people take the pieces exhibited in art museums as undoubtedly authentic.  This movie projects that suspicion onto these seemingly impenetrable temples of great artwork.  ""Fake"" explores the basic human desire to be esteemed for our talent but warns of the great lengths some may go to gain recognition, however misdirected.  A great movie for anyone interested in the inner workings of today's art world.",1328227200,,500,5.2125
