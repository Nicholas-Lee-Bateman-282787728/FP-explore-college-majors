5888213,5,B00E3UN6N6,A good special and a must see before watching the upcoming season three. If you loved the first two seasons you must see this special.,1395964800,3,134,4.4
5888214,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Great show for understanding the period in Great Britain with its unique set of problems and ideas. Interesting to medical people as it shows the backwardness of ideas compared to today. Midwifery went unpopular with so called ""modern medicine"" to popular again today.",1395100800,,268,5.255813953488372
5888215,5,B00E3UN6N6,"This is one of the best series I have ever watched. No trials, murders, crime scenes, no f bombs. It is, however, harsh reality of the way things were at the time. I think it will appeal more to females but expect many men to enjoy it too. I cannot wait for the fourth season and have already paid for it. Oh, to live in a simpler era. I would love to see more series set in the 30s, 40 s, or 50s. Think I am getting too old.",1393891200,48,425,3.7865168539325844

5888217,2,B00E3UN6N6,I pre-ordered this in November of last year and it still hasn't shipped.  What is the hold up?  I am sure I will give it more stars when it arrives.  I loved the first two seasons.,1390608000,,180,3.9444444444444446
5888218,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I almost never write reviews, but this series is so wonderful that I felt I had to write one. I am not a big fan of period or historical movies/series, but this series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. EVER. It took me until episode 2 to fully get into the characters/story line, but gosh, once I started watching I did not want to stop. I am so happy that there will be a season 3 at some point but it can't come fast enough for me. I like Downton Abbey but I LOVE this series.",1389916800,58,487,3.88

5888227,5,B00E3UN6N6,I started watching this when my adult daughter told me about it. She has a friend in England and her friend said it very popular there.

I am so impressed that the writers have not strayed from the original intent of this show which was to highlight the struggles and joys of midwifery in the late 1950's in east London - they have done an excellent job of keeping the stories fresh, interesting, historically accurate, and focused.

5888316,5,B00E3UN6N6,"This show takes place in the late 1950s, and the authenticity of period transports the viewers to a bygone era. It is the dawning of the national health care system in Great Britain. Based upon the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, the series focuses on Jenny, a young nurse and midwife, as well as on her dedicated colleagues, in a teeming and impoverished East End slum in London.

Working with the nuns of the Order of St. Raymond of Nonnatus, these caring young women provide necessary health care to neighborhood families, focusing on pregnant women, as in 1950s Great Britain, home births were still the norm. They are often aided by Doctor Turner, a wonderful local doctor.

Historically, the show is utterly fascinating. It certainly makes the viewer appreciate the comforts and medical marvels of today. Moreover, the triumphs and travails of each and every one of the characters are engrossing. This season polio rears its ugly head, and the dedicated Dr. Turner does all he can to stem the tide, only to be thwarted close to home.

This is an extraordinary show, superlative in every way. From the first rate acting by the entire cast to the outstanding production values and well-written scripts, this show soars. I am totally  hooked on it and am already TV binging on season four.",1455494400,,1287,4.836363636363636

5888340,3,B00E3UN6N6,"The first season was so perfectly balanced.  Trixie's ""party girl"" personality was fun, light and perfectly complimented by Jenny Lee's proper and easy-going nature and Nurse Miller's slightly mousey and accommodating personality.  Then of course Chummy was all gold heart and everybody's doting mother.  Interspersed with the pain and agony of child birth and heavy problems of poverty were the light-hearted escapades of these young nurses on their off-hours.  Even Trixie's lip syncing after hours for her friends while they ironed and sipped tea was so enjoyable, the viewer wanted to be a part of it.  Then Chummy got married, and though the whole marriage episode was great fun, Season Two's dynamic shifted just a bit (trouble was on the far horizon).  Like  a little girl lost, peering through the glass window at the fun and life on the other side, married life took her away from and out of the circle.  It was here she made the bizarre decision to up and become a missionary and left the show for most of the season until the end when she returned very pregnant and matronly.  No more the delightfully bumbling and lovable 4th midwife, but now ""in control"" and all settled down.  Also the ""girls"" didn't have the fun escapades like the first season to effectively counteract the problems they dealt with.  By Third Season, Chummy missed her camaraderie with her midwife chums.  She showed it and expressed it.  The midwives missed her.  I missed her.  Peter seemed to annoy her, dragging the script down.  And I became restless and irritated.  The girls seemed to work hard, too hard, at including her in their fun----but----well; she couldn't join in and was forced to be left behind;  You know.... baby,husband cooking and all......She also now took on ""In Charge"" positions which detracted from the Chummy we were all introduced to.  ALL fun escapades were gone and cast members were dropping like flies.  A new replacement nurse for Jenny Lee was tough and undermined Trixie's queen position as the ""naughty girl"" that we all liked to gasp and giggle over for her boldness.  This new intruder took some of her thunder and squashed all the girlie fun.  Sister Angelina's abrupt exterior with a heart of gold interior, was challenged with the dirt of a homeless drunken brother.  I don't blame Sister Jullienne for going ""away for a Rest"".  By the end of Season three I needed one as well with a few stiff drinks to drown the sorrow for what ""used to be"".  From the demolition of the the East End, including the midwife house to the ever increasing social issues of everybody on screen, the fun has been slapped right out of the series.  And don't throw up the night out to see My Fair Lady.  Even that turned disappointingly sour when it was found they had purchased scalped tickets and ended up for a very brief scene in a smokey bar throwing darts.  How can this even begin to compare to the near-skinny-dipping scene and dance night of the First Season.  Even Third Season's ""fun"" was a drag. And the effort to try to force the very, very brief bar scene into a fun escapade was painful.  I've given it 3 stars because the acting is still good and the few original stars in their original roles are good, but that magic combination is gone.  Everybody has their own little soap opera going on.  Sister Bernadette should have stayed a nun. It's awkward at best seeing her trying to still be a part of the sisterhood.  I squirm every time I see her interacting.  All dolled up and smoking; tensions in her life and marriage have changed the whole dynamic that she brought to the show.  As the seismograph records the small earthquakes of awaiting doom, so the Third Season portends of a disaster awaiting in Season Four.",1445472000,2,3735,4.71141975308642

5888405,4,B00E3UN6N6,"And I mean it. Too much of the dialogue is unintelligible to the American ear. I hesitated between giving this series a 3 or a 4 star rating and settled on 4 stars due to the, as always, extraordinary presence of Pam Ferris (please see her in The Darling Buds of May, a really lovely series) and many of the other actors like Miranda Hart who was just great.

The character of Sister Monica Joan was given far too much screen time. I found her tedious in season one. How many times can we see a woman in labor without wondering if they might have come up with a story line to captivate us instead of yet one more woman in agony? There were many wonderful characters from earlier seasons, some of whom should have been brought back into season 3.

This simply does not rise to the level of a 5 star series and really falls somewhere between a 4 and a 3.",1432857600,,852,4.189024390243903

5888439,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Be warned -- only sensitive, caring people will appreciate this series.  This show is really about the interaction of the ensemble of adult women characters and the way they help each other cope with the difficult situation in which they live and work.  No action, no violence, little mystery; lots of charm, loads of emotion, some pain and grief, plenty of joy and triumph.  I enjoy it because I enjoy women.  This is a serial, so the episodes really only make sense in order.  We have found that we can watch it over again occasionally without becoming bored with it because Midwife is so well done.  Watch it with your girlfriends or female progeny.",1428364800,,652,4.675438596491228

They are joined by young secular women who enjoy all of the benefits of a safe home and the freedoms to partake in the general culture as well.  The series is historically based and goes through pre-WWII days to the 1970's.  Every detail is correct from styles to music.  I think that the Anglican nuns are honestly depicted in a positive way.  One of them speaks in Shakespearean English which is delightful.!,1420848000,,510,4.549450549450549

5888504,5,B00E3UN6N6,"What is it about this series depicting the lives of a group of midwives in London's East End in the 1950s that makes it so compelling? First, the stories are intensely human, with flawed but enormously likeable characters. Secondly, the writing is superb, telling stories that are often tragic but always including some hope and inspiration for better times. Thirdly, I can't say for sure, I just know I love it. When the first series was shown on PBS a couple of years ago I was somewhat repulsed at the thought of watching such a show, but I gave it a try and was hooked within five minutes.

In the third season we see quite a bit of change going on at Nonnatus House. For one thing the House itself has had to relocate, finding a more spacious though somewhat dilapidated home in the Poplar district of the East End.  Then Jenny and Trixie both find new love interests, while the former Sister Bernadette, now  married to the local doctor, adjusts to her new role as wife and mother, as does the loveable Chummy with her policeman husband. Some things stay the same: Sister Julienne is still unflappably in charge, Sister Evangelina is as brusque but dedicated as ever, and Sister Monica Joan is just as ethereally batty.

There's a sizeable dollop of sorrow to be found in these stories: babies are born but sometimes don't thrive, and occasionally their arrival causes more pain than joy to their parents. Jenny discovers that love is often blended with sorrow, and she is forced to reexamine her sense of dedication to Nonnatus House several times.  Chummy's difficult relationship with her upper class family, particularly her mother, undergoes new strains, and a new midwife turns out to have a tragic history of her own.  There's also reconciliation, however, between Chummy and her mother, between Sister Monica Joan and her fragmenting memories, and between Trixie and the man she is beginning to love. And mixed in with all this is plenty of laughter and joy. This season ends with the departure of Jenny, who has been the main character and guiding voice of the series thus far, but with so many strong secondary personalities I feel sure that future series of Call the Midwife will be just as wonderful as the first three. I know I certainly intend to keep watching!",1420588800,2,2281,4.732997481108312

5888506,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I LOVE this show!!  I never knew anything about midwives and when I was pregnant, was pretty much discouraged from truly seeking the assistance of one.  Maybe this show was a Hollywood-ish but their devotion to their work and the storylines are just so heartwarming and inspiring.  Makes me feel a little cheated that I never investigated the use of one.  At any rate, this show really grows on you and you can't help but grow to love all of the main characters.",1420416000,,462,4.530120481927711

I liked watching these on public TV when I happened to come across them and now wish that I have kept it that way instead of just getting all three seasons on DVD, but that, I guess, has it's ""plus"" side, too ...

5888566,5,B00E3UN6N6,"It is always a temptation to think it would be fabulous to plan an all day or weekend marathon to watch each season.  However, I can never watch more than one or two episodes at a time because in addition to being a captivating  drama, I find it to be a highly emotional experience, on many levels.  I love the Nuns and the Mid-wives, especially Sister Monica Jane, Chummy, and Jenny, and get thoroughly wrapped up in their experiences.  I also find it very enlightening and thought provoking when seeing the situations they deal with and how they deal with them.  As a Neonatal Intensive Care Nurse, I rarely find any show dealing with the Birthing Process or medical situations able to engage me beyond critiquing the accuracy with which this is portrayed.  I can watch any episode of this series without getting caught up with how well it is done, rather than what is happening.  It has sparked some very deep reflection on my part about what I do and how I do it, and whether progress in some aspects of medicine and patient care equates with improvement, or if sometimes there are some very important aspects of caring which have been left behind. This is also the first show dealing with medical situations that I have ever been able to share with my mother.  She finds if every bit as captivating as I do, and it has given  me a way to help her to understand some of what I deal with on an almost daily basis.",1414800000,24,1416,4.436293436293436

5888572,3,B00E3UN6N6,"I liked this show once,but now it's become daytime soap. And the insideous practice of digital colour grading which has infected every period piece over the past few years, is ruining it. This means that the director can manipulate the colour of the image to his whim. So if you're wondering why the 50's in the UK looks like an old MGM musical, this is why. The UK during this period didn't ever look like a contemporary video clip, and this is why the piece has lost all it's authenticity. The colours are so intense, all semblence of reality has gone.  All it needs now is musical numbers.",1414195200,,592,4.481481481481482

5888581,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Call The Midwife Series is one of the best shows on TV! The Brits really know how to do it.

First of all, the characters -- ALL of them -- are so believable, it's easy to get lost in the believability of each story, each episode. Secondly, the midwifery scenes are so believable, you wonder how they produced these shows without seeing actual hospital deliveries.

What I most like about each individual episode is that there's always a combination of serious drama, moving emotionality and great humor that brings real smiles. I laugh and cry each time I watch these episodes. And I never tire of watching them over and over!

The entire Series is a true treat!",1413072000,,663,4.601694915254237

I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to watch a great series which is set In East London, England during the 1950's. It is based on a Midwife's real time serving this community during this time period. It contains real life drama and happiness. I would recommend starting with the first series and watching them all! There is no swearing, murders, gore, etc. Just a beautifully written record of what the midwifes and their patients endured. Wonderful!!

5888648,5,B00E3UN6N6,I love this series. The characters are wonderful with compelling side stories. Also it is interesting to see how the UK responded to the need for  nationwide healthcare and how that developed in the 1950's. The roles and trials of women in society is also portrayed showing how expectations and mores have changed.,1409875200,,314,4.9245283018867925

5888652,3,B00E3UN6N6,"Once again we have returned to Poplar in the East End of London and the lives of the nuns and nurses who deliver babies.  Yet there are some changes on and off screen that have a big impact on the show.  First Nonnatus House has changed it's location (the old set was demolished apparently), second and more importantly by the end of last series the writers had exhausted all three volumes of Jennifer Worth's memoirs that the show is based on and Series 3 is entirely original material separate from Worth's books and the real people in them.
Something doesn't feel right with these episodes.  The emotional punch that used to reduce me to tears in nearly every episode feels somehow lacking.  The plots are ok but it feels as if they are deliberately trying to set up melodrama and force it to come out of situations.  The recurring plot of Jenny and her love interest Alec is handled with all the delicacy of a teenage fling, and a rather downer ending that is dealt with very quickly.  This series' focus is much more on the personal lives of the nurses.  Not only Jenny and Alec but Trixie and a handsome vicar.  Slightly sweeter are newlyweds Shelia (formerly Sister Bernadette) and Dr. Turner.  It's great that in some respects each character is coming into their own (even the nuns).  But maybe this is the point where the show is moving in a more melodramatic direction than we've been accustomed to.  In the last episode a major, MAJOR character leaves and her goodbye is a relatively flat, quick event without any of the emotion I've come to expect of this program.
But I've come so far with these women, seen too many babies born, and shed too many tears that I can't just abandon them!  I have faith in these actors, the characters they have brought to life, and the writers who crafted such amazing stories.  I hope that particular beauty and genuine emotion that I have come to expect of ""Call the Midwife"" will be found once again!",1409788800,3,1947,4.560344827586207

A friend recommended this series and after watching the first 2 seasons On Demand, we couldn't wait for this one to become available and purchased it.  This ranks with our top favorites and should get 10 stars!!!  The characters are interesting and well-developed and the implementation of socialized medicine is explored.  We are appalled at the living situations of  patients introduced each episode, in the rubble following WWII.  WELL worth the cost!!",1409529600,,598,5.177083333333333
5888665,5,B00E3UN6N6,Some of the very best television I've ever seen! Hollywood needs to take lessons from the BBC on how to make birth look real. Smart to stop after three seasons. Every episode was stellar.,1409443200,,187,4.529411764705882
5888666,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Although the writers had to alter the character of Jenny in order to accommodate the path the actress chose, and this made her a less-appealling character and a seemingly flaky one, she never was my favorite, and I think it did not harm the series overall. In fact,  I think the series could become even more heartwarming if the focus is on the remaining characters, minus Sister Monica Joan ( while played superbly, she is just too irritating). I hope more fleshing-out of Dr. Turner occurs, too, and of Fred (the handyman entrepreneur).",1409443200,,538,4.78494623655914

5888672,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Amid TV's lineup of great but grim dramas (think ""Breaking Bad""), this British series truly shines as poignant and uplifting. Great acting by a wonderful cast nearly always delivers tears and smiles along with little history lessons and wonderful human stories woven into a driving plot line derived from the real life experiences of a late 1950s group of midwives serving the poor of London's East End waterfront. It is a wonderful glimpse of the human and societal soul at the cusp of the medical revolution and start of the feminist movement.",1409270400,,545,4.934782608695652

5888674,5,B00E3UN6N6,Great writing and acting by everyone on the show.  Before this show I had no idea about midwifery and it's importance to hundreds of thousands of lives.

As always the episodes are spot on.,1409270400,,369,4.7936507936507935
5888675,3,B00E3UN6N6,Enjoyed the first season and story and plots have become less about the lives of the people the midwives serve.  Which I found just as interesting as the life of a midwife.  Hoping for a return to feel of season one in upcoming season.,1409184000,,235,4.318181818181818

5888880,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Superbly done BBC show about the work of nuns and nurse midwives in London's impoverished and war-wracked East End.  The costuming, writing, and cinematography are all superb, as is the realism of obstetric situations, emergencies and complications.  it's amazing what these women were able to do on their own in people's homes with minimal equipment available.  As a family physiciian who has worked in poor areas of inner city Chicago and the migrant health service attending deliveries over decades, I find that their experiences recall similar experiences attending births among immigrants in this country.  If you fall for this show as I have, I recommend reading the memoirs on which the series is based, which will give a much richer, and at times darker aspect to the situations as is possible in book form.",1404172800,,815,5.059701492537314

5888886,5,B00E3UN6N6,Another of the classic British series that we Americans have come to love.  It is obvious with the upgraded sets that they intend for the series to stay around for a few more years which is a good thing.

We are quite glad she kept her memoirs and shared her life that gave such a part of herself for others.  Witty, solemn, compassionate series.",1403827200,,276,4.6875

I loved the music, the fashions, the story, and of course, the Midwives. Chummy was so endearing - we've actually adopted some of her expressions at home (""Bravo, Old Thing"") :-).

5888902,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I was a baby in the 1950s just outside of London in a blue collar neighborhood when this took place.  i was even delivered by a midwife at home.  This show just seems so authentic, although we weren't  quite as poor as the residents of the East End were,  it was  the way we lived back then.  The writers and directors must have lived it.  The actors in this series are believable and lovable.  Great, great series.",1403568000,,415,4.298701298701299

5888905,4,B00E3UN6N6,I was hooked after the first few episodes of Season One.  Who knew that a series about having babies in London's east end would be interesting at all?  Definitely worth your time.,1403568000,,179,4.5625

But as you come to know the different characters the series grows on you.  When I finished watching season two, I couldn't wait for season three to become available....and it was great.  You become friends with these midwives and all their trials and tribulations.  Season three wasn't cheap to purchase, but it was worth the money.",1403308800,,474,4.607142857142857
5888913,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I'm not even sure what made me watch the first episode but I've been hooked ever since!

We love the time it's set in (although we were barely alive or tiny children then), the view of that world, the story lines, the variety of characters, the music, and the warmth of the whole thing.  We never watch live television, but we have seen all three seasons of ""Call the Midwife""  through Amazon.",1403136000,,453,4.555555555555555

So happy!!!. The series is about four British midwives who live in a convent with four nuns, the time period is set just after the war (1950's) and it goes into each of their lives as they work as midwives. Each episode kind of tugs at your heart, especially when you see the delivery of the babies... oh my gosh it looks very real too!  But its not just baby deliveries, there are great story lines. Both the midwives and the nuns have unique personality's. Its just one of those programs that makes you feel good after watching it. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I laugh.  It is so worth it to watch ""Call The Midwife"".",1403049600,,789,4.2885906040268456

5888929,4,B00E3UN6N6,"This entire series (season 1-3) is just my speed. It tells a god story about the Baby Boom, midwives and the transition they were going thru (where babies were stating to be born outside the home) and the transition that the nuns were going thru with waning numbers of sisters committing to the convent life. The hints of Women's Lib shows up as well- old and the emerging feminine cultures.",1403049600,,391,4.6

I thought for sure this would be a movie just for the women...lol I sat down with my wife to watch this I did this because she is so gracious to watch some movies I favor just to be together. Now the surprise happened when I realized what wonderful show this was and how realistic it is in it's portrayal of life in the 50s, in less affluent neighborhoods in England. Where midwives were needed to bring new babies into the world...this is very well staged and the actors & actresses are superb",1402617600,,549,4.392156862745098

I was going to wait until reruns came on but then my friends told me about it.  I had read that a Season 4 is in the works and my friends said ""no way"", the final season 3 episode wrapped up the story line.  I could not wait so I went to amazon.com and ordered just that episode.  It was on my Kindle Fire within a few minutes.  Great wrap-up of Jenny's story line.

This story of midwifery and life in the 1950's is perfectly acted and perfectly wonderful.  It is not a soap opera or a reality show.  It is simply one of the many fine British dramas chosen by PBS to share with American audiences.

The nuns and the midwives are just a hoot to watch and each episode has a different theme and lesson learned. The series is well filmed and produced and for me it is just one of the best on TV.

It shows how in many ways British TV dramatic series shows are very professionally done and very entertaining. We like them a lot and I believe you will too.",1401840000,,596,4.219298245614035

I read somewhere that season 4 might be interesting however I also read that this season 4 could use someone's sexual choice to define their humanity.  How boring!  Also, it speaks to the fact that the writers are unable to produce a storyline except rather use a wonderful story with 3 wonderful seasons to make a political/sexual statement.  I question anything when others are trying to push something down another's throat and they have to use a platform like movies to do so.  No thank you!",1401667200,,631,4.6909090909090905

5888982,5,B00E3UN6N6,"The Call the Midwife series has become one of my favorite shows of all time. I was fascinated by the stories of the nuns and midwives as they interact with caring and humanity with the people in the very poor east end of London. After the each season, I wonder how they can continue the story at such a high quality, but I've never been disappointed. Simply, an incredible story based on the real life memoirs of one of the midwives.",1401580800,2,433,4.3580246913580245
5888983,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I watched the first two seasons on Netflix, and was pleased to find more of one of my all time favorite shows available on Amazon Instant Video. I'm sure if you wait long enough it will come to Netflix, but if you love this show as much as I do, you won't want to wait. Not only is the acting and writing wonderful, it is extremely interesting in a medical/historical sense. I am a person who loves period dramas, the wonder of what it must have been like to live back in the old days. The nuns, especially the old doddering one, Monica Joan I think her name is, are superb, as are all the actors who portray the midwives. Jessica Raine (Jenny) is exquisitely beautiful, and Chummy is so endearing, and even Trixie who appears shallow on the surface are revealed to be so much more.  I gave this season five stars because I love the show so much even though this season moves a bit more slowly, as we are still reeling from an incident which deeply affected Jenny (main character)  earlier in the show. If you are a fan of Call the Midwife, you already know, bring your box of tissues. I prefer Kleenex lotion. In short, the trees give this show no stars because they are losing their number to the weeping fans! I mean who doesn't tear up when a birth is depicted, and you get one in just about every episode, if not every one!  Hollywood, are you listening? We need more shows like this one!",1401580800,,1393,4.309160305343512

The first woman I spoke to told me she would get me a replacement but did not put it in. I ended up having to call back and have a replacement sent to me almost five days after the first call.

It just ends with a narration from Vanessa Redgrave explaining that the man she just met becomes her husband and they have two daughters.... What? I'm not sure how the BBC and PBS think the show can go on without the main character. The other characters are strong, and they've already taken artistic liberties and deviated from the original memoirs of Jennifer Worth.

This is not only a series which is meant to be enjoyed by women. It is a TREAT for any thoughtful person. In short, DON'T MISS IT!",1400976000,,434,4.723684210526316

5889055,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I love, love, love this show!  The characters and actresses are all very different from what American's usually get to see from the BBC (either pre-WW2 or mysteries).  It's been 1958 for 3 seasons, which is a little odd, but  I honestly don't care.  The actresses who play the nuns are so familiar and have years and years of experience and I've been watching most of them for decades.  I enjoy newcomer Jessica Raine.  Good actress.  Well worth the watching.",1400371200,,459,4.6625
5889056,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I'm not normally one to cry over... well... anything. But this show pulls at my heart, every episode. It speaks to humanity. At least the humanity I'm hoping still exists all these decades later. The actors bring these characters to life in ways that make you fall in love with them. You care about each of their stories and you feel as though you're their family. It's such a simple overall story in some ways, but yet it brings in the complexities of life in such a beautiful way that you will relate to every sub-story, celebrate every joy, and weep for every heartbreak.

I sat and watched the first two seasons online. They were so inspiring. While I'm not in the medical field I am in human services as a social worker. This show, whether intended or not, sets such an incredible precedent for how to help others. It reminds you of where your passion lies within you and the stories fill you with such emotion it reignites that passion.

Kudos to the author, kudos to the actors... and kudos to everyone involved in this show. I hope that this series continues long into the future.",1400371200,,1088,4.517766497461929

5889061,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I very seldom watch anything on PBS, but I did watch the Christmas Special last December. My plans were to watch the new season when it officially started, but it slipped my mind and season three started without me. Yes, I could have went online and read each episode synopsis, as the season had already aired in the UK on BBC, but this is one series I enjoy watching, so I patiently waited until it came out on DVD. Season three has many things going on, including a few new characters. Once again, Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job with writing memorizing scripts. All of cast gives great performances, as well. There may be only eight episodes (well nine if you count the Christmas Special), but a lot happens in them. Considering the series is returning for another Christmas Special and a fourth season next year, I was a little shocked at the ending of the episode eight. I don't won't to give away the ending, but I will say that one character's journey comes full circle. I am curious what Heidi Thomas has in store for the Nonnatus House next season. Overall, I enjoyed watching the Call the Midwife: Season Three DVD and I highly recommend it to others.

I don't know how the director did it, but the outcome is incredible.  Several of the beginning episodes seem like repeats of other stories I have enjoyed (A Taste of Honey), but the interpretation is different enough to keep things interesting.  Now in Series 3 the story has branched out from the emotion of every childbirth to stories about each midwife.  Still interesting, not quite as emotional.  Still worth seeing.

5889079,5,B00E3UN6N6,I love this series. It shows what life was like in immediate post-war London and what deplorable conditions were for families living in a poverty stricken area. Piles of debris also show  how slow the government was to clean up blitz damage from poor sections of the city. The portrayals of the young girls learning to work on their own and the personalities of the nuns they lived and worked with gives three dimensions to them all.,1399766400,,433,4.623376623376624

5889097,1,B00E3UN6N6,"I enjoyed the first 2 seasons, but in season 3 the stories have become increasingly unrealistic.  The poor people of Poplar are receiving extraordinarily good & elaborate medical care, often miraculous -- beyond ridiculous, just feel-good fantasy.  Almost all the characters are absurdly good.  The episode involving teens with Downs syndrome was final straw for me: in that era, the standard treatment of people born with such disabilities would have been institutionalization shortly after birth with the families told to forget about them.  Both kids would have been suffering from a lifetime of severe neglect, probably sterilized automatically at puberty, and have no rights or no awareness that they deserved more than neglect, abuse, and disrespect.  Why would Call the Housewife want to paint such an absurdly unrealistic picture of the lives of people with Downs during that era?  Are most viewers so ignorant of disability history that the wildly unrealistic depiction of teens with Downs syndrome who have nice schools, dances, pretty clothes, and even inspire some dignified responses wouldn't seem absurd?",1399334400,7,1118,5.433526011560693
5889098,4,B00E3UN6N6,Better have a box of tissues. Yet it is amazing and keeps you coming back for more!  One of my new favs,1399334400,,103,3.6818181818181817
5889099,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I personally believe Call the Midwife is the best TV drama I've even seen. I missed the 2013 Christmas Special on PBS, so I bought it here on Amazon to catch up before I begin Season 3. Wonderful show, dynamic characters -- and best of all Chummy is back, of course!",1399334400,,266,4.235294117647059
5889100,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I love every episode! Great attention to detail, great writers, classic actors and a inspirational base story. I have all the books and episodes. I have become a huge fan of British TV this past few years and encourage the producers to keep up the good work.",1399334400,,258,4.51063829787234
5889101,4,B00E3UN6N6,The Christmas special added characters and events featured in Season 3 and was enjoyable to watch.  Recommended for any viewers who missed it when originally shown.,1399334400,,164,5.3076923076923075
5889102,5,B00E3UN6N6,Love the period drama. I enjoy seeing how the British Midwives practiced after the war. Would highly recommend for light entertainment.,1399334400,,135,5.476190476190476
5889103,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I have LOVED this series from the very beginning and I am still ""hooked"".  The series is now in Season 3.  Nonnatus House was demolished at the end of Season 2 and I couldn't wait to see where Nonnatus House was going to relocate to.  There were a couple of ""surprises"" at the end of Season 2 and Holiday Special.  One surprise involved Sr Bernadette and Dr Turner and his son Timothy.  Another involved the ""narrator"" of the story and female lead, Jenny and a romance.  Season 3 is now airing on PBS and is almost finished.  According to Amazon home-page, the DVD and Blue-Ray sets have not been released yet.  If it weren't that my husband was recently laid off of his job of 20+ years, and money being extremely ""tight"" right now, I would have already ordered Season 3 DVDs.  For now, I have them recorded off-air to the cable DVR.  When the series is complete, I plan to record to VHS tape.  Then, when we can afford it, I'll get the DVD set.

This series is set in the East London neighborhood of Poplar, in the very late 1950's and early 1960's.  Nonnatus House is home for about 8 midwives, a combination of religious Anglican nuns and ""civilians"".  There evidently, are other sisters at Nonnatus House who don't make home visits.  In fact, the only time we see them are for prayer services.  There is one nun, Sr Monica Joan who was a visiting midwife, but stays at Nonnatus House to live out her days.  Supposedly, she is over 90, but she looks like she is about 60.  A new nun has joined Nonnatus House this season and we don't know much about her yet - Sr Winifred.  While Jenny is away, there is a ""fill-in"" nurse at Nonnatus House, who is hoping to add midwifery skills to her skills-base. Sr Winifred is in the very early stages of character development.  I can't wait to see how her character progresses.  I like the way the director had developed the characters in this story.  I also like the added insights by the actors into the characters they portray, after the ends of the episodes.  We would never have guessed Sr Evangelista's history without that little insight!  And we get to enjoy seeing Sr Evangelista being honored on the 25th anniversary of her religious vows, despite her protests.

The only negative thing I could say about this series is the absence of indication of time-lapse from act to act and scene to scene.  Everything else about this series I absolutely LOVE!",1399248000,,2401,4.5
5889104,5,B00E3UN6N6,"It's formulaic, but it is a formula that works very well!  For a brief period, the viewer is carried into a world that, despite the challenges, reminds us that ordinary lives can be full of meaning and goodness.",1399248000,,211,4.552631578947368
5889105,5,B00E3UN6N6,"I love this series. It's definitely more of a chick thing, but it has so many things to keep my interest, without being violent and having swearing thrown at you with every sentence. It's a love story as well as a story about a young midwife learning about life and coming into her own. It has interesting side stories that include dementia, acceptance, happy births, sad births and tackles situations such as poverty, inter-racial issues, and disabilities in a way that touches the heart. Great music too.",1399248000,,506,4.827586206896552

5889112,5,B00E3UN6N6,I have really enjoyed Call the Midwife.  It gives historical context to so many of the diseases and cures we take for granted today.  Polio used to be so devastating to so many families.  I went to school with children who were affected by it.  But today it has been eradicated.  The relationship between medicine and faith also is featured and I think that is good.,1399161600,,366,4.484848484848484

In episode 1 Chummy, a most inept homemaker, happily returns to midwifery, and Sister Monica Joan diagnoses the mysterious illness of two non thriving children by recalling a passage in one of her arcane books.

Episode 2 Jenny deals with a pregnancy that is the result of an infidelity and Cynthia introduces relaxation techniques which she believes will ease the pain of childbirth.

Episode 3 The wise and lovely Sister Julienne goes out of her way to help a young mother, who imprisoned for petty theft, fears that her baby will be taken away from her. This episode made me bawl from beginning to end.

Very touching and the harshness of the poverty depicted makes up for a script that occasionally veers into sentimentality.

The acting is superb and I particularly enjoy seeing Jenny Agutter, who has aged very well, still active.

This series provokes the mind to think about how far we have come in the delivery of babies and the diseases that were more apt to kill the mother and child.

5889189,5,B00E3UN6N6,"Call the Midwife is story telling at its finest as the series is well-written and filmed. The stories will take you back to an earlier era where it was common for women to give birth at home assisted by a midwife. Call the Midwife tells the story of the Anglican sisters and their lay counterparts on how they helped care for women living in somewhat impoverished circumstances. In Episode 1 Sister Monica Joan, who's character is a delight to watch, helps diagnose a rare medical disorder using some historic documents. At first everyone kindly ignores her diagnosis until they realize that Sister Monica Joan was right.

There are some adult scenes as the series does show women giving birth.

Highly recommend.",1397174400,,713,4.884297520661157

The whole wonderful cast characters is back and facing changes like one of the sisters getting married and finding a new home.
