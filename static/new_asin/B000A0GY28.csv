2346787,5,B000A0GY28,"I watched this movie on two sessions,.
It was worth the money spent, and more. The scientific knowledge the Tibetan medicine is introducing here is vast.

There are also Western professionals who confirm the miraculous healing properties of the plant extracts described.
His Holiness Dalai Lama gives a plenty of correct and precise information, which is easy to remember and understand.

This very high class document is the top of my movies. hmm, I've got four of them:D",1257033600,20,472,5.038461538461538
2346788,5,B000A0GY28,"This documentary follows the Dalai Lama's personal physician and the art of Tibetan medicine. This is an eye opening view into how they diagnose and treat every disease or deficiency known to humankind.

This film shows how Tibetan medicine works (in a nutshell), from diagnosing through a patients pulse to the medicine made by the good doctor himself.  The knowledge that exhibited about the body and its interactions with the herbs, plants and minerals that he turns into medicine is astounding.

This is a documentary and are alot of subtitles, and the english that is spoken sometimes is hard to understand, however a glimpse into this world is well worth the purchase. The information alone will make you want to seek out a Tibetan physician.  Hopefully one day we will all have availability to such knowledge.",1253318400,26,816,4.977941176470588
2346789,5,B000A0GY28,"This film should have been subtitled ""A cure for cancer?"" - i only wish I had seen this film when my friend was dying from a tumor and from the AMA treatment of it.  This is a really powerful film with great science and information in it. I'm buying one for my doctor today. *Editing comment in 2011* Apologies for not being more specific. Five years ago when I posted this comment, I assumed hundreds of others would appear. My wife got this film through Netflix, I'm a fan of Tibetan medicine, as I've studied it a bit and met the Dalai Lama's doctor, Yeshe Donden.  He said ""we didn't have much cancer in Tibet until recently, but we've had some success in treating it.""  In this documentary, the filmmaker takes the time to show the Tibetan healing practices, focusing on a Tibetan Doctor in Mongolia where he cures a Russian man - If memory serves me he was given 3 months to live.  Mind you, this is Mongolia - middle of nowhere, the Doctor is working with herbs and ancient tradition - but it's amazing to watch (and kudos to the filmmaker for showing the process).  I can't recommend anyone suffering from cancer to travel to Mongolia for treatment (unless you can, of course), but I highly recommend viewing this film to get a sense of ""holistic"" treatment. Not everyone is well versed in it. Certainly medical science has taken leaps and bounds - but this kind of healing, based on centuries of knowledge of plants and how they affect the body, and the toxins that affect it - combined perhaps with a good mental attitude - can produce startling results.  I think there are 3 patients covered in all - each with different doctors, each healed through the traditional Tibetan method.  That being said it's very hard to find traditional Tibetan medicine in the US - there's a Tibetan psychologist at UCLA, via Tibet House in NYC you can find herbal medicines being grown at their retreat in Menla.  I've spent years reading and studying - this film shows direct results.  It's not for everyone - the Tibetan doctor will taste a patient's urine, for example, to examine it for clarity, pollutants, toxicity etc. That's pretty startling in itself - unless you think about the logic of it - if you're testing clarity of water coming through a plant, it makes sense to examine the end product. But these Doctors can read a person's health merely by feeling their pulse.  Thank god for the internet, as one could never learn about these things before, and thank this filmmaker for taking the time to make a film that really gets into the heart of the medicine used.  It's empowering for a patient to be able to say ""Have you seen this?"" and ""I'd like to try something like this"" and not be laughed out of an office. My dear departed friend did as much research as she could, tried as much alternative methods before cancer took her in 96 - and I wish I'd seen this before - we would have had fun drinking tibetan chai and churning yak butter in Mongolia. Funny, she sent me on a journey AFTER her passing. It's resulted in my book ""Flipside"" which is here at Amazon. I mention it because you never know where the message for you to follow your path might come from - and we all need to be more open to it.  If you have a friend or know someone suffering from this disease, it makes sense to share this film with your loved one. RichMartini",1163548800,161,3342,4.478618421052632

2346845,3,B000A0GY28,"Most DVDs about healing are much more sophisticated and fast moving than this one. If you are seeking a DVD to teach you a healing technique, this is not the one. If you are familiar with Chinese healing techniques, you find many similarities here. The pace is slow--not that this is good or bad--just a fact. Here is the man who treats the Dalai Lama and monks who were treated horrifically by the Chinese, as well as those who have been told there is no cure for them. The story of one of the female monks brought tears to my eyes and to the eyes of the practitioners who was treating her. I wouldn't be alive today without Chinese medicine, so my view of this DVD is from this viewpoint of gratitude and respect for these loving practitioners. If you've been told there is no hope for you, seek a Chinese doctor with many years of practicing the art of Chinese herbs, diagnosis, and acupuncture.

Anyone in the healing or medical field will enjoy the DVD. It does talk scientifically about how and why the herbs work.

That was helpful for me because I do all the writing for his company and it gave me a new perspective.
