 For the most part the picture quality is quite good, although I noticed in The Blacksmith some seriously deteriorated frames.",1085788800,,340,4.151515151515151
7961221,1,B000065QA3,"We rented ""The General"" and LOVED IT! I bought this version and when I watched it I discovered they've changed the musical score. Can you imagine changing the musical score on a silent movie?!!! The music was changed to a classical instrumental score. My 10 year old son, for whom this movie was purchased, was very upset and we haven't watched the nasty thing since. Hello, in a silent movie the music is one of the characters and is just as important as anything you see on the screen!
It was disappointing!",1076976000,2,509,4.543478260869565
7961222,2,B000065QA3,"This is very cheap and when you see it you'll know why.
The picture quality is o.k. but the main film Keaton's classic The General has been transfered at the wrong speed.
Everything seems to be happening in slow motion.
The other two films (The Blacksmith and The Paleface)seem to be at the right speed but The General is the main feature on this disc so I would advise looking for another copy of this classic film.",1070928000,4,416,4.415584415584416
