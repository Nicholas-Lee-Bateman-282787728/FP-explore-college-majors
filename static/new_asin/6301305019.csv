7811302,4,6301305019,"Feeling like a cluttered variation of Renoirs more successful works, something about Elena and Her Men feels like The Rules of the Game directed by Mel Brooks.  I kept getting this Blazing Saddles vibe, especially towards the end where things became slightly unhinged, and it felt, to me at least, like a film that was made about fifteen years too soon.  Thrust this into the mid-70s and youd have a film that felt at home, but placed in 1956 this film feels of a different era.  That isn't to knock the film (I loathe Blazing Saddles, but that isn't the point of the reference), for Elena and Her Men mostly works, but there is a clear feeling of disconnect in parts.  The film tells the story of one womans love affairs that range from a general and a political party candidate, all while another man, who threatens to derail everything, falls in love with her.  From a purely political angle, Ill admit that some of this went over my head, but French politics were not uncommon in films from that time (just wait until the 60s French New Wave took it to another level) and so Im used to it.  It is far from a detractor.  Bergman is great, as always, but the real star here is the beautiful sets and costumes which capture your eye and don't let them go.  This is a visually stunning film.  Its a lesser known Renoir, so I highly recommend that if you are a fan of the director that you seek this out, but if you are new to Renoir, Id start somewhere else.",1398988800,,1458,4.350553505535055
7811303,3,6301305019,"And a look at some of the most amazing costumes ever created for the screen. Take for example the white outfit she wore to the opera. The feathers erupting from the sleeves were so long Mel Ferrer had to draw them apart like curtains to see the stage.
Speaking of this Count of C., he was an amusing if strange pursuer after Ingrid's charms.
The Rollan dude was interesting as well, although a bit too weird at moments. It seemed that his sole interest in life was kissing Ingrid on the divan.
The story is fluff and not well connected but definitely not boring and something I'd enjoy watching fairly often.
I have to run along now but I can't think of anything else to say anyway so hail and farewell.",1028419200,,703,4.374045801526718
7811304,5,6301305019,"Renoir subtitled this film ""a musical fantasy"", and it does have a Mozartian briskness, putting one in mind of Le Nozzi di Figaro, with its various romantic complications.  Bergman, radiant, plays a Polish princess  who is able to direct the destinies of various men through a talisman.  She  remains romantically detached, however, until she meets the dashing General  Rollen (Jean Marais).  The problem is Rollen's longtime friend Henri (Mel  Ferrer)also loves the princess; thus ensues a romantic triangle.
The  movie has the airiness of a well-choreographed light operetta and is  greatly abetted by Claude Renoir's superb color photography.  There are  occasional lapses in taste with the comic relief, but this is a lovely film  worthy of repeated viewings.",962064000,,763,5.372881355932203
