7927022,5,B00004Y9PS,"This video has eps. 17-19, titled `Betrayed by Home . . . Far Away' `Tallgeese Destroyed' and `Assault on Barge'  Since the Gundams no longer  have any purpose on Earth, they return to space, where Quatre fights with  his father in `BBHFA'.  In `TD' Zechs breaks loose from Treize & OZ and  gets himself hurt, and in `AOB' Duo is captured.  Three great shows and a  must for everyone, since this tape shows how the Gundams went from Earth to  space, plus interesting background revealed on the pilots.",968025600,8,501,4.613636363636363

7927024,5,B00004Y9PS,"Well, I've got to say, of all the Gundam series, GW is the best. The storyline, the animation, all amazing. Also, you may notice, after a while, that Heero is wearing spandex pants. Anyways, getting back to the topic, Gundam Wing has amazing mobile suits, 5 gundams, designed and built by 5 scientists. Their seperate names are Sandrock, HeavyArms, Wing, Deathscythe, and Shenlong. I'd get this one as soon as possible. But if you think it's all just a shoot-em up, you're wrong. Thanks to Duo Maxwell, the group isn't all serious, with nothing to talk about but their mission. The storyline has been beautifully written, and the cartoon flawlessley drawn, except for the colours on the Shenlong Gundam (who designed that thing anyways?!). Well, all in all, Gundam Wing is even better than all the other Gundam series, which is something. The only thing bad about this anime is the complexity of the plot. Took me a really long time to finally get what the plot was. I know you'll have a great time watching this amazing cartoon unfold, revealing one suprise after another!!",967680000,,1074,4.8108108108108105
