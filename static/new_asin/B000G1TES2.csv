2598225,5,B000G1TES2,"This DVD is fun and not overwhelming for my two-year-old and my four-year-old.  Bao Bei definitely captures their attention (and affection!!) and inspires my children to repeat words and phrases in Chinese.  I think that this is a perfect introductory series for English-speaking children.  I have tried other DVDs, which had WAY too much information for kids and were too much like drills.  The kids in this video are multi-ethnic and of various ages, which I really appreciate.  My kids adore Bao Bei and her cricket friend.  The quality of this series is tops!",1211241600,4,563,4.9361702127659575
2598226,5,B000G1TES2,"I am so excited to hear about the release of the next DVDs. So glad you are doing these... I bought some ""other"" DVDs but nothing compares to the quality of yours!",1209427200,2,163,4.125
2598227,5,B000G1TES2,"We own all four Early Start Mandarin DVDs and love them! We hope another video will come out soon. My kids have learned a lot from Bao Bei and love to watch the videos over and over again. The videos are entertaining and beautifully filmed. The cast of children is of varying ages and of different ethnicities. The amount of vocabulary taught in each video is not overwhelming to our children, so the videos don't feel like they are drills to our kids. The kids are learning a lot, though!",1206835200,,489,4.444444444444445
2598228,5,B000G1TES2,I wish these videos were sold as a set.  Our family loves watching all of the Bao Bei DVDs.  We're all picking up a lot of Chinese.  Our kids don't even realize that they're watching something educational.  They just want to watch Bao Bei over and over again.  They laugh a lot while watching and repeat the Chinese words and phrases.  We really like the glossaries at the end of the 3rd and 4th videos.  The moving mouth has helped my wife and me a lot with pronuncation.,1199491200,8,472,4.295454545454546
2598229,3,B000G1TES2,"I've seen a lot of language videos, of various languages, and this one spends a little too much time teaching the name of the puppet, etc., and similar administrative things that have no language value.  All in all it's good, though.  It kept my kids' attention, which is important.  It's just not one of the best that I have seen.",1190505600,5,331,4.483333333333333
2598230,5,B000G1TES2,"My 3 year old loves both dvds!  She keeps asking for Bao Bei!  I've heard her say things in Chinese around the house.  I know she's definitely learning, and she's having fun while she's doing it.  I don't expect her to be fluent in Chinese by watching a couple of dvds, but I think her pronunciation is quite good and this is a great introduction.  Hope they come out with more.

I thought my 5 year old would be too old for this dvd, but she loved it!  The colorful dvd really captures her attention.  She seems to really enjoy watching the panda.  There's the right amount of repetition of the words.  Seems like she's picking up some words!",1182384000,13,643,4.3277310924369745
2598231,2,B000G1TES2,"My daughter and I are big fans of the TV show, however, this particular video is so BORING!  It started good, but just dragged and didn't get better.  I did not like the fact that in the 3rd cartoon, they had a pet rabbit in their classroom named ""Wabbit"".  Some children really do pronounce ""r"" words with a ""W"" sound, so it doesn't help when you are trying to teach a child how to say something properly when the whole time the TV is saying ""Wabbit""",1060905600,,451,4.22093023255814
8128579,5,B000G1TES2,Excellent educational product. Easy for young children to learn a new language. Extremely fast shipping.,1504224000,,104,6.0
8128580,5,B000G1TES2,"I see a lot of reviews complaining that this DVD ""only"" teaches four animals and four colors. I think that the people dissatisfied do not understand what this DVD is and what it isn't, or they don't have a background in language acquisition.
As a professional interpreter with international organizations (like the UN) and State Department, and multiple degrees in linguistics, I think I am uniquely qualified to talk about this topic.

This DVD will not teach your child Mandarin. It is meant to be a fun support at home, for reinforcement and practice. If you have a bilingual home or your child attends Mandarin lessons elsewhere, the DVD will help them with their vocabulary. If not, then I'm not sure why you're buying this DVD.

The DVD teaches 4 color words and 4 animal words, along with a few phrases and expressions (like ""my little friend""). It is simple and repetitive--- just like the DVDs in English people put on for their babies so they have 15 minutes to wash the dishes or shower. The key to language acquisition, whether your first or tenth language, and at any age, is repetition. Constant repetition. If you studied Spanish in high school you probably still remember some of the stupid songs they made you sing- it's dumb, but that's how we learn and remember languages. Frankly, if my daughter can remember 8 words and a couple of expressions from this DVD, it's the best $7 plus shipping I ever spent. As far as the cheap production- do you think your kindergartner cares? We grew up watching 1980s TV and never noticed how bad the graphics were until we looked them up on YouTube.

As far as the DVD itself- my kindergartener loves it. (Full disclosure: as a language professional, I speak 5 languages fluently and use them all at work, but Mandarin is not one of them. My daughter for some reason fell in love with Chinese and I indulged her rebellious linguistic choice. I stocked up on language DVDs because I can't help her with the silly songs myself on this one.) Bao Bei is cute, nonthreatening, and easy to follow. It's not a total immersion DVD, but it does a good job explaining what things are. I like watching with her because I pick up a little myself. Bao Bei encourages the audience to say words out loud and we say them together. It's a good before-bed activity.

Pro tip to the parents hoping to teach their children another language: The key to learning any language is that the kid is interested and thinks its fun. Some languages do not ""speak"" to certain people (no pun intended). When you learn a language, you are not just remembering how to say words- you are diving into an entire culture and mindset. You had better like it if you want to be successful. My daughter was the one who insisted on learning Mandarin rather than a European language I speak. But to keep up her motivation I bought her a stuffed panda who looks kind of like Bao Bei and gave it to her with the DVD. We always get Bao Bei to sit with us when we watch the DVD.",1494892800,,2985,4.522222222222222

8128582,2,B000G1TES2,This held my 2 1/2 year olds attention for all of one minute. Might be better for really little ones who are not talking yet?,1247097600,,125,4.04
8128583,3,B000G1TES2,"Good introduction but my 8 year old was bored.  The 9 month old was intrigued however.  I enjoyed that the words were spelled out in close proximity to its use, and repeated.  I know my colors in Mandarin Chinese now too!",1235952000,2,221,4.341463414634147
8128584,2,B000G1TES2,"I bought this DVD thinking that my daughter (22 months) would love it, since she loves ""Baby Learns Chinese"" DVD. But I was disappointed. She is not interested in this DVD at all. I am also not happy that it has both English and Chinese. It would be more effective if it is ALL in Chinese. Children learn best if they are totally immersed in the language. I speak both English and Chinese, and the ""Baby Learns Chinese"" DVD definitely has better pronounced Chinese.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Learns-Chinese-1/dp/B0010XTGUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Learns Chinese 1</a>",1234569600,14,629,6.0
8128585,3,B000G1TES2,"This DVD was colorful and slow-moving.  It was great for me, an adult who knows not-a-word in Chinese.  My son, 3-years-old, could have used a faster pace.  With English translation, it was a non-threatening way to learn four colors: red, green, blue and yellow; four animals: dog, cat, duck and rabbit; and a handful of useful phrases.  New words were repeated often and clearly.  And, for the adults, I loved the section at the end which gave the phonetic spelling for the Chinese words and phrases.",1222387200,4,501,4.77906976744186
8128586,5,B000G1TES2,"I love that this video series features children of all ages and many ethnicities -- so welcome in our bi-racial household.  My kids love repeating after Bao Bei and friends.  This DVD series makes my kids WANT to learn more Chinese and encourages my kids to use the vocabulary they learn here.  We can't decide which DVD we like best in the series (you can watch them in any order), so our family recommends you get them all.",1217289600,2,425,4.423076923076923
8128587,5,B000G1TES2,"I am a Chinese American while my husband is Caucasian.  Although we speak English at home, we really want our daughters to be able to speak Mandarin as well.  The Bao Bei videos have been great and definitely a hit in our home.  My almost 3 year old is always asking to watch Bao Bei and my 10 month old is fascinated by the colors and characters in the videos.

What's most fascinating is that my almost 3 year old now can name all the colors as well as count in Mandarin.  If you are a parent and want your kids exposed to and learn Mandarin Chinese, definitely get all the Bao Bei video series!",1216684800,4,597,4.156521739130435
8128588,4,B000G1TES2,My almost 3 year old son loves this dvd and requests to watch it quite a lot.  we've only had it a month but he's already pick up quite a lot of the vocab. i think it would be more helpful if the pronunciation vocab at the end was put at the bottom of the screen or after each word rather than right at the end so that a connection can be made between the spoken and written aspect of the language - which is why I've only given 4/5.,1215129600,3,433,3.811111111111111
