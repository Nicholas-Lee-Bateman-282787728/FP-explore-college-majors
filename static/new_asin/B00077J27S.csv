8045458,1,B00077J27S,"I don't know about the video - but for clarification the paso fino is not a thoroughbred horse. The translation is probably trying to say ""pure bred"". The paso does not trot. The gait is called troche, and it resembles a trot but can be ridden without posting. Pasos do not have jarring gaits and are the only horses that perform a perfectly even four beat gait naturally. I might have purchased this video, but the english description is so poorly written I was put off. I own paso fino horses and would own no other breed - they are spirited and willing, truly gifted athletic horses. Amazon - clean up the editorial description of the product.",1363132800,2,646,4.52991452991453
