200439,5,1589973623,"This is great. It is done clear, short and to-the-point. This is a good way to gather some basic biblical parenting you can apply right away. It is in segments so they aren't too long at one sitting and can easily be fit in to your day here and there if you don't have time to watch much television. Wish I had this several years ago.",1247529600,,334,4.075757575757576
200440,5,1589973623,"We loved this study! We used this study in our Sunday School class at church.  We used the workbooks and the DVDs.  It was a wonderful series that encompassed parenting birth through teenagers.  It gave us the practical information we needed right at our fingertips without having to read an entire book.  Dr. Dobson has written some amazing books on the topic and he gives you the best of all of them right in one place.  Some of the intro  cartoons are hokey, but he made us laugh.  It prompted great group and couple discussions.  The completed workbook will be something we refer to for years to come.  Every parent should have this information- this world would be a better place and our children would become much better adults.",1212969600,6,734,4.627906976744186

7799548,4,1589973623,"Dr. Dobson always does a great job. I must say this series is different than what I expected. I wanted to get my hands on some of Dobsons' earlier seminars on child discipline, to be used for a church Sunday school class. My husband and I viewed his film series on this issue back in the eighties, when we were starting our family. Since it was so helpful to us, I thought it would be great for the new parents at church. This new series gives information using animation, which is a unique approach, however I must confess I miss Dobson's stories and light humor from his earlier work.",1391040000,,586,4.385321100917431
7799549,1,1589973623,This is the worst advice I've seen on parenting. This is what it wrong with the world are people like this author. Do you want what is best for your kid? This is not it!,1361232000,,169,3.857142857142857
7799550,5,1589973623,I love James Dobson and really respect his teaching. My husband and I are going thru this series now. I recommend it to every parent.,1357257600,,133,4.36
7799551,5,1589973623,Our small group just started this study and I just wanted to add that there is Scripture involved if you buy the Participant's Guide.  We picked up the Leader's Guide as well.,1334361600,2,175,4.46875
7799552,5,1589973623,"This is a great video for parents, especially Christian parents, who want guidance on how and when to discipline their children.  My only complaint is that there is no referenced scripture in the video.  If you are looking for a DVD for a Bible study group, this DVD does not directly use scripture. HOWEVER, all the advice in the DVD is obviously based on scripture.  It would be better for a discussion group as opposed to a scriptural study group.  It would be fantastic as supplement to a bible based study for parents.

The advice is timeless and it guides parents through the stages of their children's developmental stages.  You would not discipline a 2 year old the same way as you would a junior high aged child.  It has funny cartoons which are great visual aides, but most of the DVD is Dr. Dobson talking in his study.  He's engaging, easy to listen too and he's an expert on discipline.  You won't regret buying this.",1289779200,2,930,4.554216867469879
7799553,5,1589973623,We are using this video for a small group study in our home.  We are enjoying the material and what is has to say.  The video is humorous and informative.  It is definitely recommended to have the accompanying leader guide and all families to have participants guide.,1267142400,2,267,4.638297872340425
