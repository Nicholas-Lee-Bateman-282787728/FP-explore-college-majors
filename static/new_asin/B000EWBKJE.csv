2542343,2,B000EWBKJE,"Okay, what do you expect from a movie with this title?  I went in with little expectations and was not surprised at the film's ineptness.  Had it added a little more humor (even though the ping from the frying pan when the girl attacks the killer is hilarious), this movie might have been campy enough to be fun.  However, it's the same old story of a group of young people (they can't be teenagers, they look too old) who ""borrow"" one of the guy's parents' RV and head off to the mountains for a camping adventure.  I've often wondered why these guys do this---when they get there, all they do is sit around, drink beer, smoke pot and get laid---the same thing they do at home!  Anyway, the killers identity is easy to spot and the supposedly trick ending is ridiculous.  Now all we need is a slasher at an orphanage or something.  Not recommended.",1148688000,,849,4.438709677419355
2542344,1,B000EWBKJE,"This movie reeks!  The acting is of the caliber found in only the worst kindergarten productions.  There was not one good actor or effect in the whole movie.  Special effects were laughable at best. I was hoping to at least see the obnoxious Roger killed in some horrible way, but we were robbed of even that small pleasure. The hillbillies were almost as bad as Roger. Whats with the black shower curtain clad bad guy with the one red LED light for an eye? And we couldn't figure out why the cardboard machete never broke when the killer was slapping people with it, and the ketchup appearing blood was especially poor. The jar of red pickled pigs feet was just plain stupid. There were so many bad scenes one would have to list the whole movie, and I just don't care to relive that much of it! Where do people get the money to throw away making garbage like this film? The only thing I was scared of is the prospect of maybe seeing this film again. Whoever was the creator of this bomb needs to put down his crack pipe.",1148601600,,1021,4.335078534031414

2542346,1,B000EWBKJE,"I have seen horror movies of all kind, some I have enjoyed, some are really just horrific.  This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen in all my entire life.  And there have been quite a few.  The acting is bad.  The gore effects are bad.  The very storyline itself is beyond bad.  Editing is even bad.  The people that created this monster of a movie just didn't know what they were doing.  I just don't know how to corelate words to convey the horror that is this film.  I think going to the dentist would be a better time spent than rewatching this really bad movie.  What ever you do.  Do not watch the movie.  Do not own the movie.  Do not rent the movie.  Please.  For your own sake.  Sleepaway Camp is a Shakespeare production in comparison to this movie.",1148342400,2,767,4.222222222222222
2542347,1,B000EWBKJE,"This film may be the worst I have ever seen.  Surely anyone who gives a good review, like the person above stated must have worked on the film.  Many parts in the film don't seem to make sense, such as when one of the women is tied up to the back of the Rv out of nowhere.  And how a person being dragged behind an Rv makes it out alive and well.  None of the killings, gore, acting, or action come anywhere near close to alright.  If you look at the cover of the dvd it shows a chainsaw on it, and clearly when you watch there is not a single chainsaw in it.  The movie is so bad they cant even get the cover right, don't waste your time with a movie that wouldn't be able to make the b-rated category of horror films.",1148256000,,719,3.924137931034483
2542348,1,B000EWBKJE,"The only good reviews you will see are the people that worked on the film. I don't know how it got picked up, but the quality and the lack of acting makes this film disgusting. SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE! Buy a t-shirt instead.",1147910400,,223,4.209302325581396
2542349,4,B000EWBKJE,"If I can paraphrase from Forrest Gump, Lions Gate Films are like a box of chocolates.  You really never know what you are going to get.  Sometimes it might be a rich chewy caramel, and other times it might be one of those nasty fruits.  Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised by Motor Home Massacre which is a campy throwback to the slasher films of the 1980's.  And isn't it scary that were now looking at slasher films of the 1980's with a nostalgic eye?  It's a low budget film but the filmmakers at least seem to know this and don't take themselves too seriously.  The plot is standard fare:  A group of good looking friends packs up an RV and heads out to the woods for a good time, only to encounter a goggle-wearing ( I kid you not) psycho bent on busting up the party.

Yes the acting is quite Amateurish, especially on the part of the women.  It's pretty clear most of them are along for the ride because they are very hot and show some skin and have fantastic bodies.  Certainly Motor Home Massacre gets an ""A"" when it comes to having a hot female cast.  Shan Holleman as the female lead Sabrina is quite attractive and does an OK job, as does Tanya Fraser as Nicole.  The rest of the females are pretty much just eye-candy.  It's a fairly action-packed slasher with decent special effects and decent gore along with some pretty inventive kills.  I'd say the cast and crew had a pretty good time making the film.  Technically it's OK.  The music is pretty uneven and there are spots when it's a bit too dark but all in all, you can do much worse for a recent slasher film than Motor Home Massacre.",1146614400,14,1606,4.3389261744966445
2542350,5,B000EWBKJE,"Loved it!  Fun horror movie in a style similar to Jason X. Laugh and scream at the same time!

2542382,4,B000EWBKJE,"I loved the humor and the plot.  Black comedy film with a twisted sense of tilted humor, it's due to become a cult film !!

Lead actress, shan holleman, is heads above the others, in looks and acting execution.

I found myself looking over my shoulder while in the woods after this one!",1160956800,,286,4.3584905660377355
2542383,1,B000EWBKJE,"Slasher movies are the red-headed step child of the horror genre. They are the easiest to do and also the ones that are usually terrible and completely unorigional. This is an example of the worst of the worst. It takes the basic slaher premise... a group of fun loving adult-teens go on a road trip only to be stalked and picked off by a ""hidden"" killer. There are the token victims and in this films case, there is no fun trying to determine who will live and who will die because once any of the characters spoke, it was EXTREEMLY evident what their fate would be. So, our dim-witted future-victims go to a camp site and despite learning there was a murder there the night before stay there to ""continue"" with the fun as planned. They even befriend a young woman at the camp site (all the alarms should have gone off... someone else in a campsite where a murder went down... hmmmm) and chill with each other by a fire as they talk and ramble about stuff a script couldn't have even improved upon. Each and every actor was gratingly off... and not a single one of them did not get on my nerves. As I watched them speak, I wondered where these card board cut outs who only appeared human like came from. So, when they were finaly dispatched, I felt little pity and maybe a little satisfaction. Of course, it was not enough that this movie had horrible actors and a weak suspensless plot... it also had a killer who was down-right unbelievable. I mean, yes... I guessed who it was the minute the character made the appearance, but that aside there was no real way this person would be ""Strong"" enough to pull off some of the kills they did. Which brings me to the only pro out of this turd on wheels slasher flick. There were a couple of kills that were actually pretty decent. The one in the tent involving a tree, machette, and twine was quite unexpected. Taht said, the kills hardly redeem this flop of a horror film and there really is no reason to watch it... not even at a ""horror movie aprty"" night where everyone gets drunk and makes fun of the movie. Oh no... this film would only serve as the sobering last act...",1158883200,5,2123,4.377215189873418
2542384,2,B000EWBKJE,"In all honesty, I didn't expect too much; although I have been pleasantly surprised by some other straight to DVD horror films. I wasn't sure if it was their intention to be as cheesy and cliched as they were, but the ""acting"" on the Simple Life totally outdoes the acting here. There was little consistency; in one scene ""the nerd"" is wearing a button down dress shirt, and then when he climbs aboard the RV, he has on a sweater vest. The tagline on the back is even wrong! They didn't make a wrong turn (""wrong turn"" was a much better movie than this)  they knew where they were going. Bad...simply all bad.",1158537600,2,609,4.389380530973451

2542386,1,B000EWBKJE,"$23.99 for this film..on sale? HA! I wouldn't give .02 cents for it. Motor Home Massacre has to be one of the worst films of all time; Lazy effort, uninteresting, unbelievable and horrible acting. I don't think I have ever wanted the actors in a movie to die so fast and so painfully in a film as much as this one. How could any self respecting director or producer put out this garbage??? UN BE LEAVE ABLE. From start to finish, it's plain and simply GARBAGE. Don't waste your money or time.",1154044800,7,492,4.358695652173913

These so called ""actors"" are a pathedic excuse for talent. How dare they claim this is a legitimate piece of film. The film industry is an idustry of art; This is a talentless mockery of what true film making is. I honestly hope these actors have a day job.  Don't quite it people! I almost feel sorry for them, I hope they do not think this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination!

2542388,1,B000EWBKJE,"Nobody involved in this film seemed to put forth any real attempt to make it remotely worthwhile.  The acting was done by people who looked bored with the whole thing and the editing department just took a pass on this film.  What is with the guy wearing the vest and tie while inside the motor home and then not wearing them outside, and then agains appearing inside and wearing the damn vest and tie again.  So this guy took the time to put the tie and vest back on each time he went back into the motor home?  There is just poor work ethic by everyone involved to say the least.  Nobody involved in this movie will ever be seen or heard from again, not that this movies counts as a legitimate job in the entertainment industry anyway.",1152230400,,737,4.311594202898551

When you see the killer finaly it gets funny.  the funny parts are the only good part of the movie.  Dont get this unless you like low budget movies and being bored out of your mind!

Some of the funny things are in the begining a girl is killed in a tent. It looks like they stuck a cow in there and stabbed it with a plastic machette. The girl talks to an imaginary boyfriend and i cant go on because im reliving this horrible movie. A visit to the doctor is even better.",1150502400,10,691,3.949640287769784

Horrible acting, terrible directing, awful cuts, predictable and the special effect were also terrible.  The Writer/Director - Allen Wilbanks should really think about doing something else.  You really would have to be a retard to like this movie and to be part of it as well. I mean come on a ranger tries to sword fight the slasher with his wooden leg, and the director thinks that flicking a booger is funny.  I really want my money back",1149897600,2,563,4.58
2542391,5,B000EWBKJE,"so motorhome massacre is starting to get some reviews.  a little hype, if you will.  i found the film very entertaining.  in fact, i found the film hilarious.  al wilbanks wasn't trying to make a blockbuster film.  al wilbanks wanted to make a film that pokes fun at the comedic-horror genre of the teen-era slasher movies.  and he did it!  if you're not watching the motorhome massacre and laughing, then you're not watching it right.

as for lions gate?  they're no marketing geniuses, that's for sure.  they're the ones that slapped a chainsaw on the cover and plugged it as a straigt up scary as all-get-out movie when people are obviously gonna go through some kind of moment of disappointment to find that in this case you really cant judge the book by its cover.  however, now knowing this i would encourage you to watch the movie again and feel free to laugh your face off.

i do find it interesting that the people who desperately hate this movie, care enough to write a review about it.  that's considered free advertising in my book, and i just want to take this opportunity to thank you for it!:)",1148947200,7,1108,4.563451776649746

The preview said torture and the only torture I saw was on myself for watching this crap.  Thankfully, I bought it at a supermarket for 3.99 and felt bad that a supermarket has to sell a movie of this calibur or lack of to make a buck.  It was by the medicine aisle and deservingly so because it is capable of making people sick.

Granted, the acting was poor and the budget was low, but if I were 15 years old again, I can see myself and my buddies getting together on a friday night and making this a soon to be cult classic. The girls in the movie are very hot which peaks any guys curiousity and the redneck in the grocery store with that awesomely funny laugh is sure to be an impersonators dream. The one scene where the killer is chasing the brunnette down an old lane and the all you see at times is the killer chasing from behind is soooo darn funny!!!  I almost fell off the sofa.

8115046,5,B000EWBKJE,"My title may be a bit misleading, but this movie is by far the worst movie ever made which also makes it great.  My fiance and I love renting C level horror movies because of the cheesy acting and bad plots, we get a good laugh out of it. However this movie takes the cake.  At no point in the movie am I actually on edge.  The killer never seems threatening or dangerous, and you actually get to the point where you root for the characters to die.  The acting is horrendous which is probably why you have not seen any of these 'actors' in any other movies.

The absolute best part of this movie is the inconsistencies.  At several times the campers are sitting around a campfire where it is pitch black however when chased by the killer it all of a sudden appears to be early evening.  Did he chase them through a wormhole?  Also pay attention to the characters clothing.  Benji's phantom sweater will randomly be off and on between scenes.  Specifically there is one scene where he is wearing an unbuttoned oxford when getting onto the RV and literally as soon as he boards the RV he not only has his shirt buttoned, he also has a tie and sweater vest.  Is he a quick change artist?

Don't see this movie if you don't like TERRIBLE, LOW Quality horror movies absent of any horror.  If you like this movie check out other low budget crapfests like Small Town Folk and Trailer Park of Terror, number 2 and 3 on the worst movie list respectively.",1248739200,,1445,4.347014925373134

8115048,1,B000EWBKJE,"The main problem with this film is the BAD acting, directing, and obnoxiously bad gore effects. While there are some pretty hot chicks to gawk at in this low-budget flick, sitting through an hour and a half of the cheesy acting is not worth it. There is a good truck driving song and one funny scene where the blonde pulls a big, thick knife out of a nerd's pocket. This is really bad low-budget filmmaking.

When you read the negative reviews, please read all of them.  They are absolutely telling you the truth.  I'm sure you've never heard of this movie and some of the people here probably rented or bought the movie like I did based on the cover.  That's all it is a scary cover, nothing more.

8115050,2,B000EWBKJE,"well, i'm not actually quite sure what good i can say about this movie. first of all, i haven't really done my research on the film, but within the first 5 seconds of the movie it's clear this was a very low budget movie. i've divided the review into categories below in order to rate it efficiently.

PLOT(Rather bland if I may add.)

Anyways, a typical group of young friends go out on a camping trip and have convinced one of their peers to take his parents motor home out.  On their way to the camp site they are told of a story about how the area would be secluded due to killings the previous night.  (From here I was already let down!) Throughout the movie, there were many phony ""hints"" worked into the plot as to who was the killer.  After about an hour of very cheesy diolauge and VERY fake gore scenes, the killers are revealed.  The funny thing is, it ended up there were two killers.  The relationship between the killers was never specified. This to me did not make any sense.  Two killers causing all of this so called ""mayhem"", and still the audience has no idea how they connect. Wow. Also, throughout the movie these white captions popped up on the screen for EVERY word said, this was also VERY VERY annoying.

Pro's Of The Movie:

It's cheap factor had me laughing. I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing, however.

Cons Of The Movie:

Cheesy diolauge, Idealstic plot, Very very fake gore scenes, and not to mention, rather annoying, there is a character in the movie much like a slim shady wanna be making stupid comments the whole time. Nothing is more annoying than a white boy with a chain using the ""N"" word every other second. At other times I thought I had rented a porn.  Several topless sexual in nature scenes have lead me to this statement.

Overall, I could have done better with a video camera phone shooting this movie.  It was sort of funny I guess, but it was supposed to be scary. It was funny in the way that I seriously have NO IDEA how this movie ever made it out of a cheap hifi 8 camcorder. These people have lost their minds, if they ever had them.",1163894400,,2100,4.348717948717948
