It is a bitingly funny send up of all those painfully bad children's action adventure films and series from the 1970's and early 1980's. Everything, from BMX Bikers, to the Red Hand Gang and the Secret Seven, catches it where it hurts. I don't think any of the classics I remember come off unhurt. There's even a spot on assault on Bugsy Malone and a slew of jokes about bad dubbing. The acting is of the highest class (in that it is clearly deliberately dreadful), as is the script and direction. The film is Hong Kong based, so the cast speak fluent English, but are dubbing themselves, badly! Watch and enjoy, for it is hilarious, but it is violent, and well deserves its UK 15 certificate.

The film actually dates from 1986",1388793600,,821,4.473333333333334
