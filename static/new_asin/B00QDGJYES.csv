8691038,4,B00QDGJYES,"This Blu-ray is a re-release of the DVD version of the same concert. The concert was given in Salzburg Cathedral as a memorial tribute to Karajan on the 10th anniversary of his death and in his home city.

The 1999 recording is a genuine HD recording with sharp, clear and realistic imaging. The sound is presented in good stereo which manages to convey the musical performance with minimal interference from the resonance of the building which clearly had a significant echo. This Blu-ray disc marks a clear improvement over the previous DVD in both visual and audio clarity and range.

Subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish and Latin are provided for the main work but, frustratingly for the two previous items which are relatively less known and would have benefitted from sub-titles even more perhaps. The booklet notes concentrate on the Requiem with not a single word about the two additional pieces.

The concert was given by a reduced BPO and with good consideration made of period practices which keeps detail clear and avoids and hint of excessive heaviness of phrasing. Climatic points have as much impact as acoustics of the venue allow. This is a concert without applause and it concludes with a wordless minute or so of silence after which everyone quietly departs.

The concert starts with Betrachte dies mein herz und frage mich given by solo soprano Rachel Harnisch who is then joined by the excellent Swedish Radio Choir for the Laudate Dominum. This is a pair of excellently delivered performances which could only be improved by either written text within the booklet or, better still, sub-titles as mentioned above. This is a lost opportunity in the re-mastering for Blu-ray.

The Requiem follows with a particularly outstanding quartet of soloists. They were Karita Mattila soprano, Sara Mingardo mezzo soprano, Michael Schade tenor and Bryn Terfel bass baritone. This are corporately perfectly balanced yet individually outstanding when appropriate. As mentioned earlier, this is a period-aware performance within the confines of a reduced modern instrument orchestra and the resonant acoustics of the cathedral.

In that way it will probably appeal to both period enthusiasts and to traditionalists. The version of the Requiem performed is the Sussmayr completion of the partially completed original work. This is still arguably the most satisfactory version of the work and is certainly the most often played and familiar to concert goers. It would have been the version most likely to have been chosen by Karajan is was therefore the most appropriate to the occasion.

Since this recording was made the previous DVD presentation has acquired a reputation as a desirable collectors item. That desirability has now been significantly increased by the improvements of this Blu-ray version which would now be the version of first choice for those with the correct replay equipment.

This Blu-ray release marks a significant improvement over the previous DVD version but the opening two pieces are without sub-titles",1427760000,2,3045,5.225409836065574
