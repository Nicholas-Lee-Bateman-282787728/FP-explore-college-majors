196198,4,1577138112,"Normally, I disliked Shannon Tweed because they are cheap and the plot is normally just about sex.  My perspective of her was turned around when I  watched Naked Lies and this one.  This one relied more on suspense and  mystery then sex and nudity.
  She stars as a murderous and deceitful  woman who marries a wealthy man to get his money.  His stepdaughter has  suspicions about her.  After he dies of a fatal heart attack, she finds out  what she is really up to.  That is where the suspense and murder come in.  Yes, this movie may contain some strong sexuality, but it was not as  sexually charged as some of her other ridiculous films.
  Once  again, this is one of her best.  I recommend this to anyone who would like  to see a good Shannon Tweed suspense film.",965692800,22,768,4.39568345323741
196199,3,1577138112,"Shannon Tweed, attractive and talented as always, plays a cold-hearted femme fatale in a fairly good film with plenty of plot twists. The supporting cast are also quite interesting and do a first rate job. Only  quibble, several nasty violent scenes which could have been avoided.",935539200,6,280,5.086956521739131

7798975,3,1577138112,"Where to start with this one? Well, it just doesn't make a lot of sense. Not so much because the plot doesn't make sense--it's actually mildly interesting--but because the movie never figures out what exactly it wants to be: Is it a thriller? A comedy? A heist picture? A sex romp? I never figured it out, and that's because the movie's makers obviously didn't know what they were going for here.

The fact is that it does a little bit of all those, but doesn't do any of them particularly well. Heck, they couldn't even decide who the main character is. Shannon Tweed gets the cover, and in the beginning it appears to be her story...but about halfway through everything turns around and then it seems to be the story of the hot-shot (or is it dip-spit?) boyfriend, who hangs out with Candy (Danielle Ciardi), who is the only real reason to watch this mess. She disrobes about four times--one time full monty for the camera--and good lord what a body.

Her sex scenes, though, with the (in those scenes goofy rather than menacing) boyfriend, are played more for laughs. Tweed's are more garden-variety from the erotic-thriller era from which this originates. I'm telling you...this movie tried hard to have something for everyone in the adult audience...even the gore-hounds. Jack of all trades, master of none.

One other thing though...and a positive check-mark: It was refreshing to see Tweed cast as a villainess for once.",1328227200,,1427,4.816326530612245
7798976,3,1577138112,"I thought the plot was pretty lame for the most part. Would've been nice to see Shannon Tweed in some steamy love scenes, but it was the same old same old sex scenes with her. I would agree with other reviewer's that Daniel Ciardi stole the spotlight. The ""Quickie Sex Scene"" on the kitchen stove with her boyfriend and the Hotel Room ""Romp"" were the highlights for me. Very good sex scenes for an NC-17 movie.  Besides that it barely gets an average rating from me.",1235347200,,466,4.4186046511627906
7798977,4,1577138112,"This is my second review of a Shannon Tweed movie. In my first review I said - No Contest - was her best movie, I still believe that,but power play wasn't that bad even through it is just another version of the black widow genre. I think Shannon to be equally seductive as Theresa Russell, just not as talented,this movie parallels that one, but the supporting characters in this film are what make this movie interesting. Danielle Ciardi (Candice)the daughter of one of Shannons victims and her boyfriend Steve. Who are out to turn the tables on Shannon are the characters that give this film life and sex appeal. I wish there were more shannon moments. But the few glimpse's of her were sufficiently sexy!. A entertaining and sometimes funny movie. I recommend this movie as a must for your Shannon Tweed collection.",1197072000,,818,4.7272727272727275
7798978,2,1577138112,Other than a scene at the front end of the movie this is NOT a Shannon Tweed film. More time is spent with other characters who are AFTER Shannon. Shannon's scenes are boring and she seems to be walking through for most of the movie. Shame she is still a beauty at over 40 but disappoints in this one. Decent movie though.,1196467200,,322,4.209677419354839
7798979,2,1577138112,"Basically, the quality of this DVD is not good and Shannon Tween didn't perform very well in this film.  Although other girls show the nudity and sex scene, it does not help too much for this poor movie.",1152489600,4,203,4.342105263157895
7798980,4,1577138112,I liked this movie. I t has everything except MORE of Mrs tweed. She was up staged by female costar.  THe sex scenes were above average. beter then most softporn.anyone who did`nt like should just watch porn !! Better then NC17 the DREAMERS. Kind of ended like WILD THINGS.,1126051200,6,273,4.571428571428571
7798981,5,1577138112,"Girls in black suspenders , does life get any better. this is a must have for all you sad fat men out there that find it hard to attract a real girlfriend. the movie itself had me gripped (quite literally to myself) for hours and resulted in a climax i have never experienced before. Forget the storyline, get this movie for the sex!!!Its all about the Sex!!!and this delivers plenty of wild sex.
My only problem was that i ran out of tissues, which resulted in many spillages.",1047859200,9,477,4.431818181818182
7798982,5,1577138112,"I only got this movie because Shannon Tweed is by far the most sexiest and most seductive actress of all time. She looks great in black suspenders and we see her perform some of the most hot and wild sex scenes ever. Forget the storyline, get this movie for the sex!!!Its all about the Sex!!!and this delivers plenty of wild sex!!!",1005091200,30,331,4.442622950819672
