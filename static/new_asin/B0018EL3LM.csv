8269673,5,B0018EL3LM,"Both of these films are in French without English subtitles.  The same cast is in both, but they were made a few years apart.  Sophie Marceau stars in both, but the storylines don't just revolve around her.  In the first, she is about 13-years-old.  I think she's closer to 18 in the second.

Do not get these films unless you don't mind them being in French without English subtitles.

The first film starts with Sophie's family moving to the city from somewhere else.  Sophie is starting a new school and making new friends.  Being young (13 or so), a lot of her and her friends' interests are boys.

The second film takes place about five years later.  Sophie's parents are becoming successful in their respective fields.  I don't remember if Sophie is in university yet, but it's close if she isn't.  The boyfriends have changed, but the old ones are still around.

Both movies are a slice of life for a teenaged French girl.",1346371200,10,929,4.591463414634147
