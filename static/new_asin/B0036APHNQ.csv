4075425,5,B0036APHNQ,"This box style set is one of the better ones created by TCM, the movies are independently placed on individual DVDs with extras on each one. Unlike many sets, the flip side is left alone.

The quality of the burning of this set is excellent, every bit as good as buying an individual DVD. Now, there are others of this SAME exact set style by TCM that are not nearly as good: two movies per DVD and the extras aren't nearly well put together, the copies are just so, so. This particular set is one of the best I have found so far.",1295740800,23,530,4.145631067961165

8389690,5,B0036APHNQ,"I normally don't purchase RELIGIOUS videos, however this one is a keeper.  I purchased it and found more story and drama in it than some videos and are strictly a historical biblical movie. I don't often watch the same movie twice on the same day, but this one was worth rewatching to get a GREAT HISTORICAL premise for this movie. Buy it like I did,",1487116800,,350,4.384615384615385

8389698,4,B0036APHNQ,"Francis of Assisi and Bernadette are amazing and inspirational films.  They alone are worth the money.  The Gospel Road was a little slow for me.  I haven't watched A Man Called Peter yet.
Recommend it for anyone wanting to be spiritually inspired!",1367798400,,248,4.857142857142857
