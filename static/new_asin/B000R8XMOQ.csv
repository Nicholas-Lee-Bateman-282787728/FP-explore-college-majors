2861989,5,B000R8XMOQ,"Amazing to see in high-def! The packaging lies though, it says Disk 1 is the Blu-Ray with the bonus features, however the disc labeled as such inside is the basic DVD. Luckily the disk labeled with the Blu-Ray logo is actually correct and I caught the mistake before investing time to watch the wrong copy. Nitpicking aside, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",1462320000,4,364,4.703125
2861990,1,B000R8XMOQ,"TOP GUN has been reissued on blu-ray about 3 times now by Paramount since it's first blu-ray reissue
back in 2008
this 4th time is a new steelbook reissue which has been advertised as 30th anniversary which is bulls***
it's an advertising con, Paramount are trying to sell this making fans think theres new bonus material on the Disc
that's absolute Bulls***
all the same special features & same HD transfer has been carried to this new steelbook from previous blu-ray versions
there is no new extras at all i Guarantee it
the only thing different is the packaging & new artwork with 30th Anniversary printed on it
so if you have the previous blu-ray versions, it's waste of money buying this new steelbook
unless you want it as collectors item then buy it i guess
but there is no new extras it has the same special features & HD transfer as previous blu-ray versions
5 stars for the film, 1 star for this new steelbook version cause it's new packaging version
so don't be conned into buying it if you already have the previous blu-ray version of the film",1462147200,8,1055,4.557894736842106

I'm giving this 4 stars cause it doesn't include the very well done 3D conversion of the film.  Plus no soundtrack or 4K version.  Oh, well.  They will milk this movie forever on future editions.  lol",1459123200,43,1996,5.226837060702875
2861992,5,B000R8XMOQ,"Top Gun is one of my all time favorite movies. So I was a little curious about this new issue, since most movies when they have an Anniversary Addition they usually don't say Thirteenth ! But I really do not see any other extra's mentioned that would entice me to purchase the new release.
Being on Blu-ray is great but I already own an HDX copy on VUDU.com. Show me more of what is in the extra's please that would convince me to purchase the new release. I often will purchase a movie if it gets a newer more under the hood edition, like remastered onto Blu-ray.",1457222400,7,564,4.280373831775701
2861993,1,B000R8XMOQ,"To clarify: I hate the terrible merchandising exhibited here, not the product, which does not yet exist. Today, on March 5, 2016, there are three reviews, two of which are obviously for used product, for a product whose debut date is in May, two months into the future. This is worse than useless information - it will become confusing and divisive as it becomes part of the REAL reviews for the actual product. What I came here to see was useful information that might persuade me to pre-order the product, such as ""digitally mastered from the original film."" The only information offered that meant anything to me was ""dts surround sound"", which is very desirable to me. With no product claims, not even what is on the second disc, why should I buy it instead of watching the free, fuzzy, SD version one more time on my TV? My new Sony Bravia 55"" TV is reminding me of decades ago when I paid $200 for a Shure phono cartridge/stylus and discovered how much noise was mixed-in with the music on my LPs. I also thought VHS movies looked great on my 21"" analog, CRT TV. Most of you will understand what I mean.",1457136000,18,1109,4.467980295566503

2861995,5,B000R8XMOQ,"I have to say this is very nice package and the movie, well, it just rocks big time on Blu-ray Hi Definition!! The sound is utterly amazing and when played back on your sound system it is like actually being right there, well, almost! Paramount has done an outstanding job on this movie, the extras and the package. I found this embossed ""metal pack"" a pretty good deal. They can be found at Target stores for a reasonable price. Check it out yourselves. I got mine for a mere $9.99 a few weeks ago. Opening up the metalpak, you have the Blu-ray on right side and a nice photo of an F-14 Tomcat as an inside graphic. VERY cool and did not expect that. I have noticed this trend taking place now and I like it as I find they are nicer than the standard plastic Blu-ray single case usually sold.
I found that I could easily get the disc out and put back in with no problems. I would press down the center ""hub"" with my left thumb and lift the edge of the disc out slightly upward and then it would come out. I did this a few times, no hassles. These paks do not come with insert notes as such, but they have a nice hardy case, embossed on the outside and nice graphic photo/s on the inside for a decent price, you bet I will get these.
Handle them with care as you would anything in your movie library, but these things are very sturdy.
The movie itself has some fabulous features and if you are a TOP GUN fan like me, you will NOT want to miss this edition!!
All features and movie are on ONE disc which is perfect.

The bluray looks fantastic and it upgrades to 2160p 4K if you have an upscaling bluray player. I have one, a Sony. It looks really good on the Ultra 4K TV 55"" Vizio.
The Menu is pretty decent with music from the movie and scenes being played. I really like it and I think the navigation for it is fairly good.

2862055,5,B000R8XMOQ,"Overall a good value for a repack of stuff we already have and for new buyers or guys that missed out on the extras and digital copy this is your 2nd chance.  I only had the bluray version not the other versions or bluray/dvd combo, bluray digital etc, so it was a ez decision for me to wait for this version.  Until they come out with a proper 4k or if there is a 4k version of Top Gun this is the only bluray version am getting till then.

any kid that grew up in the 80's should definitely pick this up or go to vudu to pick up MotherGoose....

 The video and sound quality is good for a 80's movie and I don't expect dolby atmos or quality like todays films, so I think for a bluray movie release its okay.  On my 7.1 setup with soundbar, sub woofer, 2 rear speakers, 2 side speakers,  the sound is really great especially on planes scenes or Maverick taking down the fools.hehehehe

If your a fan and feel the need to get the best bluray set this version is the best until the 4k version comes.  You get a special case, ultraviolet digital copy, and of course the bluray/dvd versions. Also pretty decent or cheap price tag too I only paid 12$ at bestbuy and found a perfect copy with no damage or broken case.  Now I see Amazon is selling it for same or cheaper so don't wait too long to get this baby.",1473465600,9,1307,4.110236220472441

2862091,3,B000R8XMOQ,"The video transfer isn't really stellar. It appears as though it was only up-scaled rather than a real transfer from the original film. There were plenty of grainy parts shown on scenes, especially the dark ones. You could also see the warping effect surrounding the image of the moving Tomcat while landing on the aircraft carrier.

As for the case, mine came with the bluray disc detached from its case slot. Good thing the disc wasn't scratched. The DVD disk has a ""Disk 1"" marking, so this was kind of confusing given the description at the back of the case said the disk 1 is supposed to be the bluray disk and the disk 2 would be the DVD. The bluray disk did not have any disk# label at all.  If not for the bluray label, I had to check (and double-check) the case as to which was which.",1464134400,7,793,4.315436241610739

One would have expected something new for a 30th anniversay release, but we only get the steelbook treatment as a ""anniversary"" exclusive.
So if you have the previous Top Gun release on Bluray, or Bluray 3D, nothing new here to see.",1463616000,3,372,4.828125
2862095,5,B000R8XMOQ,"Just so everyone knows this is a limited edition steelbook with both a Blu-ray/DVD inside the case. That means there are 2 seperate discs housed inside the steelbook also. Also, the combo pack includes access to a Digital HD copy of the film for those interested.

Between the Blu-ray and the DVD there are a ton of extras which will include music videos, TV Spots, interviews, featurettes and more behind the scenes footage.

The actual steelbook is really cool looking and looks great on a shelf. As for the video and audio on the Blu-ray it is the same as released before. With that being said if you're a fan of the movie or Tom Cruise or any of the other actors this is a great copy to own.

For the price, I can easily recommend this for purchase. Some say its just another money grab but i say its worth every penny!",1463443200,21,823,4.366013071895424

I've always enjoyed this film because of the story, the cinematography, and the music and this Blu-Ray brings it all out in wonderful Hi Def audio and video. However, I enjoyed the one hour and 45 minute or so ""making of"" bonus so much that I think that, that alone makes purchase of this disc a worthy addition to any collection!",1463270400,2,424,4.3125

8199451,4,B000R8XMOQ,"This is for the 30th Anniversary steelbook edition, not the movie content.  I saw Top Gun in the theater when it was originally releases and own a VHS copy of it.  This is a movie that begs to be seen in the best possible resolution and highest quality sound, so when I got the bug to see it again, this time on my new larger and better TV and newly enhanced sound system with three room rattling subwoofers, this blu-ray DVD version is the one I chose to buy. Was it worth it, or did the quality of my home theater system outdo the quality of this release?

I wish I could say this is the ultimate version of Top Gun but its not. Visually its impressive but the reality is this movie was filmed over 30 years ago and while the DVD is worlds improved over my VHS copy, it would take a far more intensive digital remastering to equal the quality of several other digitally remastered classics I can think of.

But lets face it, what always made Top Gun a heart stopper in the theaters was the sound and here I would say this is the best release yet and Im not sure what more they could do to improve it, after all they only had a Dolby two-channel track to begin with and this movie screams for multiple rear, center and the full 24.1.10 channel Dolby Atmos home theater experience (note that I don't have that and I don't know anybody who does, just sayin). The DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 offers plausible surround effects and clear intelligible dialogue but falls short a little in really being able to rattle the windows.

So the bottom line is that for the twelve bucks I paid for this disc Im happy and I like it.  I wish they could have done more to wow me but reality is a real thing.",1517702400,,1687,4.22360248447205
