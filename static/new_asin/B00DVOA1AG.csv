The actors are so good at presenting there characters, but the one thing is, has anybody ever noticed the kids are not in it very much? Half the time , i forget they have kids:)
  It's a clean show , and very funny..i can watch it with my kids , and that says a lot.",1297123200,,484,3.6893203883495147
5859814,3,B00DVOA1AG,"It was a christmas present for someone and when it came and I was going to wrap it I heard disks moving. I opened it and around 3 of the disks was out of place in the box set. They was not scratched badly, but obviously they were cause we watched them one night and it started freezing on a couple of episodes. Very disappointed. Definatley since I bought a faster shipping so it could get here before Christmas. Again, very disappointed...",1294012800,,440,4.378048780487805
5859815,5,B00DVOA1AG,"I've been a fan of the ""Raymond"" series for quite a while and I've almost seen every episode on reruns (every so often a new episode comes on). I watched those episodes and they are all top notch.

What's great about these sets in addition to these classic shows are the ""Bonus"" features of bloopers, deleted scenes, and audio commentary of selected episodes. These ""extras"" added a deepened appreciation for the show.

If you are a ""Raymond"" groupie (like myself) or tune in occasionally, in my opinion, you won't be disappointed. Heck, you may even be inspired to add additional seasons to your collection.

Excellent value for the money! Enjoy.",1280016000,,647,4.863636363636363
5859816,5,B00DVOA1AG,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows on TV. Each character is so distinct and will probably remind you of somebody in your own family. Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",1257206400,,416,4.791666666666667

5859818,5,B00DVOA1AG,"This is a brilliant show - yes it's wholesome and heartwarming and just what a lot of us need.  I'm as in touch as anyone with UK comedy, but the writing of series such as Will and Grace, Frasier and Everyone loves Raymond is superb, the added factor for me is that I can identify with the situations in Raymond much more than the other admirable two.

Will and Grace promotes the shallow, Frasier is more cerebral, but Raymond is a life affirming comedy, I'm amazed at its consistent quality.  Yes, you can see some of the comedic situations coming from a mile off, but there is always exceptional handling even of these.  Very similar to the manic Faulty Towers (UK 1970s series) but the 'love' is here.

There are characters for everyone to identify with or recognise, and they are not lampooned, but gently handled in a positive way.  (I'm definitely a Debra/Marie person).  All the portrayals are consistently fine - reflected by the way they stay together throughout the entire run.  I think we're lucky such talent worked together for so long .

If you're looking for decent comedy with heart and intelligence, and that undervalued commodity today - morals - it's here.  Watch and enjoy.",1148601600,,1194,4.697115384615385
5859819,5,B00DVOA1AG,"This show is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen (next to Friends and Will and Grace). It is about Ray, a newspaper columnist, living with his family, and his intrusive parents live across the street.  Deborah is Ray's wife. She constantly needs to balance her own three kids and a husband. It is much harder for her when Marie keeps sub-consciously insulting Deborah's cleaning, cooking, and parenting. If you watch the show, you know what to expect when she reacts to things.  Marie is Ray and Robert's overbearing mother. Whenever she gets in people's way, her excuse is ""I do it for love"".  Frank is the most blunt, couch-potatolike,  and one of the most funniest characters I have ever watched. He keeps calling Marie a nag and the most contact he has with her is when Marie is told by Frank ""Make me: eggs, a sandwich, bacon, steak, and other foods. Marie doesn't mind at all. Frank and Marie are what you call a ""dysfunctional loving family"". The one left out is Robert. He's Ray's brother. He works as a police officer in the NYPD. Everytime he comes home with good news, Ray trumps that and gets all of the attention. These two are usually seen competeing for their parents attention. Whenever Deborah wants Ray and/or Robert that their parents (Frank and Marie) are doing something wrong, the two sons always come up with a reason to not tell them that they are doing something wrong.(For example: Marie comes over to Ray's house everyday, Marie continues to control the family without knowing it.",1119139200,2,1514,4.680451127819549
5859820,1,B00DVOA1AG,"As a person ""all alone"" as one poster says. Thanks for the rude and abusive post ""JB"". I think I deserve the right of reply for a personal attack.

""This show is a comedic portrayal of real life situations"" you say. So what, I can get that by going down my local bar. Comedy should be about more than that surely. You say it is ""wholesome"" with some pride. Who wants wholesome? Im sure you love The Waltons and Little House On The Prairie then.

Still if you marvel at really really ordinary auto-pilot comedies like this, then thats up to you.

Remember when you insult the UK, rudely, that we produced things like Fawlty Towers and Blackadder and love US comedies like Sienfeld...so our Quality Control Radar is pretty good. This partiicular comedy is buried in the ""dead zone"" of early morning TV, that is because we don't find it very funny.

But hey, we produce some of this ordinary dull ""kitchen sink"" crap. If you like that check out Allo Allo and Last Of The Summer Wine from the UK....they are like Everybody Loves Raymond. Ie dull and vacuous and not very funny.",1113264000,,1073,4.487179487179487
5859821,5,B00DVOA1AG,"What's your deal ""glynergy""? Everybody loves Raymond is average?  This show is a comedic portrayl of real life situations.  Maybe you didn't grow up with the classic intrusive, annoying and and concerned grandmother or find yourself in sticky situations with your wife/spouse but this show hits the nail on the head for many people.  The fact that you like Will & Grace and Fraiser says it all though.  FRAISER! Ha!  Talk about some arrogant sophists that don't have any grip of reality.  And Will & Grace is missing the key component of any sitcom: The voice/character of reason.  In ELR, Raymond is the only one that's ""semi-normal"" and that's what makes it funny.  I guess the UK is just too messed up on their unpure hasish to enjoy good wholesome comedy.  Sorry  ""glynergy"" but you're all alone.",1113004800,6,800,4.773722627737226
5859822,5,B00DVOA1AG,Talk about funny. This series deals with every day issues and puts a funny spin on them. Ray's style of comedy is easy to watch and I find myself in fits of laughter in every episode. A Must see..........,1107734400,11,204,4.256410256410256
8598365,1,B00DVOA1AG,"Everyone loves Raymond is great, but I recieved dvds that had the cases broken. I had plastic chips everywhere. I don't have time to return it, so it is being given in its present state as a present.  Not happy at all.",1510099200,,218,4.190476190476191

8598368,4,B00DVOA1AG,"I got this for my parents, who absolutely love the show.  They both said they enjoyed the extras that came on the DVDs as it gave them a little more peeks into one of their favorite shows with the cast and other little tidbits, but do yourself a favor and buy the complete set, the price point for the smaller seasonal releases is simply price gouging by opportunists.  At the time I bought these the full set wasn't available, buying them piecemeal will run you 2-3x the full 10 season box's price (unless you buy them used of course).",1407801600,,536,4.404040404040404

8598372,5,B00DVOA1AG,"""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is probably the best sitcom in American history. Way to go Ray Romano!

8598374,5,B00DVOA1AG,"This review is not only for the Seasons 1 & 2 set of Everybody Loves Raymond, but an overall rating of the individual season packages. I purchased all 9 seasons from this set. I was originally going to purchase the Complete Series (in the cutsie Raymond House), but had read the multitude of negative reviews and changed my mind. Instead, I purchased all 9 seasons in the boxed format . I have to say, the photos do not do this justice. The outer cases are built like a tank. They are solid and very heavy. They are basically made and open like a hard bound book. As far as the video quality and the extras, everything is here that you find in the Complete Series Set. If you purchase them in sets of two, as I did, you can save money. I ended-up paying about the same price for all of these as I would have for the cheaply made Complete Series set and none of my discs were damaged, due to faulty packaging, as with the Complete Series Set.. All-in-All, I am very happy...",1301529600,7,973,4.264864864864865
