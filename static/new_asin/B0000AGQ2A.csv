2725660,5,B0000AGQ2A,"I've seen most every Dr Who since it used to be on PBS. I've been collecting every episode since. This Doctor( Jon Pertwee) is smart, witty, and authoritative. One of my favorites. Works mostly with a millitary force known as ""UNIT"".",1327881600,2,233,4.7073170731707314
2725661,4,B0000AGQ2A,Of all the classic doctor who stories it is only the Pertwee era stories that I will buy because they dvd's have a lot of back information in the documentaries.  The story is not my favorite but the documentary on the designer who later because a big hollywood designer was very interesting.  A good buy.,1325289600,,304,4.509090909090909
2725662,4,B0000AGQ2A,"This is an enjoyable story from the middle of the Pertwee era. While it is not highly regarded by many fans, I have always liked this story. The story basics are the Doctor receives an odd object, and tells Jo that it is an important message that must be delivered. Jo follows the Doctor into the TARDIS and they end up on an Earth Sky Base orbiting the planet Solos quite far in the future. The Earth Empire is declining - they can no longer afford to keep far-flung colonies such as Solos going, so control of Solos is being returned to native populations. Mucking things up are warring factions among the native populations, apparent mutations among the native population, the murder of an Earth government official, members of the Earth force that don't want to give up control of Solos, and atmospheric experiments to make the atmosphere breathable by humans.

This was done in the middle of Pertwee's 5-year stay in the role, and it shows. John Pertwee is very comfortable and commanding in the role. The relationship between Jo Grant and the Doctor has grown to become one of affection, trust and respect. The costume and set design were quite striking. Terrance Dicks as script editor, and Barry Letts as producer had really come in to their own by this time and had formed an excellent pool of talent to pull from. Christopher Barry returns as director and does a nice job keeping the pacing going. James Acheson designs the costumes on Doctor Who for the first time and hits a home run with the ""Mutt"" costumes. Bob Baker and Dave Martin have created a fascinating world for the Doctor to visit. There are some nice performances from the guest cast: Garrick Hagon as Ky a leader of the native Solonians; Paul Whitsun-Jones as the Marshall, a bombastic over-the-top and possibly insane officer in charge of the Sky Base; Christopher Coll as Stubbs a sympathetic officer on the Sky Base, and John Hollis as Sondergaard an Earth scientist who has been hiding out on Solos after having a disagreement with the Marshall.

What has always made this story stand out for me is the idea of a planet whose orbit is so long that the seasons each last approximately 500 Earth-years, and the species living on the planet have adapted by using metamorphosis to change for the season. I like the fact that the native population had no understanding of this process, similar to the caterpillar having no understanding of its becoming a butterfly. The issues being covered in this story are colonialism, and ecology, perhaps not terribly subtly, but I don't think that makes the ideas outdated.

The extras on the DVD are quite good. The usual making of documentary was quite fun, and the interview with James Acheson on his career designing costumes for Doctor Who was wonderful. I enjoyed the documentary about black actors in Doctor Who, or should I say the dearth of black actors in classic Doctor Who, but I don't think Noel Clarke was the best choice for narrator, I found his delivery to be on the dull side. The 1 minute extra from Blue Peter was odd, had nothing to do with this story, and probably would have been better as an Easter Egg. The production notes option of watching the story was interesting, and gives a glimpse of all the concepts that the authors had to cut out of the story.

Now to the commentary option-there is a large cast of characters on the commentary track, but they are cycled through so you're only dealing with 3 to 4 at a time. Of course when you have such strong personalities as Terrance Dicks and Katy Manning, they are going to dominate the conversation. There were some lively discussions, and there was a nice chemistry between Katy and Garrick Hagon on the commentary track, and there was an interesting dynamic between Terrence Dicks and Bob Baker. Unfortunately, director Christopher Barry isn't allowed to give as many comments as I would have liked, and sound supervisor Brian Hodgson and designer Jeremy Bear were rather overpowered by the rest as well. I must say however, after hearing Katy Manning highjack the commentary track to interview Brian Hodgson, I would like to recommend that 2 Entertain have her host an extra feature on sound and sound effects on Doctor Who. It was very obvious that she had a lot of knowledge, interest and respect for the work that Brian and his fellow sound artists did on the show and I think she'd be a great host for such an extra.

While not a perfect story, I think that Bob Baker and Dave Martin have created an interesting and rich world for the Doctor to visit. It keeps the pace going pretty steadily for all 6 episodes, and it gave the Doctor a chance to get away from 20th Century Earth. Go ahead get yourself some snacks, sit down in a comfy seat and be prepared for an interesting visit to Solos.  Its.....",1322092800,9,4799,4.653301886792453
2725663,3,B0000AGQ2A,"I consider Jon Pertwee to be my favorite Doctor of all time. Easily the most physical of all the Doctors and could charm the pants off anyone (IMO) The seventies was without a doubt the golden era of Doctor Who.  As for the story itself, it is quite interesting with a powerful message. I think the drawback though was in the execution.  I would not rate this in the top 10 of Pertwee stories, but its nice to have if you are looking just to add to your dvd collection.",1302048000,2,469,4.2
2725664,4,B0000AGQ2A,"Although I have seen most of Jon Pertwee's episodes, I did not remember seeing this one.  It was very good.  Lots of action and very entertaining. One thing I did notice is that it reminded me a lot of the Tom Baker episode 'Full Circle', which is also a really good episode.",1299542400,,275,4.269230769230769
2725665,5,B0000AGQ2A,This is a great old Doctor Who episode that isn't available on DVD at the time of this post.  This is a must see episode to understand this doctor.,1229990400,,147,4.068965517241379
2725666,5,B0000AGQ2A,"Great episode! The actor that plays the Marshal does a fantastic job. AT least I hope he was acting, he was very convincing as a meglomaniac. A rather long 6 part story that never lags. The production levels were fairly high for this episode condsidering when it was made. Jo was a good companion that woeked well with Jon Pertwee's Doctor.

All in all, great acting all throughout with excellent sound effects and an interesting plot.",1184198400,3,435,4.723684210526316
2725667,3,B0000AGQ2A,"After its reboot in 1970 with ""Spearhead from Space"", ""Doctor Who"" -- with Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks at the helm -- settled into a very successful Earth-bound formula, mixing together James Bond, a post-colonial social conscience, and bona-fide alien races that weren't monsters.  A year later, with a permanent arch-nemesis in the form of the Master, ""Doctor Who"" could be relied on for one great story after another, every four to six weeks.  ""The Mutants"", however, is without UNIT, and without Roger Delgado's Master, and thus is regrettably one of the weaker entries in Jon Pertwee's tenure as the Doctor.
It didn't have to be that way.  ""The Mutants"" was directed by Christopher Barry, and the incidental music was composed by Tristram Cary.  This team worked an another ""Doctor Who"" story also once known as ""The Mutants"" -- ""The Daleks"" -- in 1963, and that was the story which put DW on the map.  This time, though, their work is less successful.  Barry's direction takes a wrong turn as the story stops short for literally minutes at a time, with location footage and CSO blue-screen sequences that do nothing but put the audience the sleep.  The music, so eerily discordant in ""The Daleks"", here does little more than annoy.
The story's heart is in the right place, as comedy writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin play it straight.  Their story is set in the 30th century, in the decline of Earth's empire.  Solos, a struggling colony, has made no advances in 500 years, and its population is still segregated, banned from Skybase but for the use of separate transfer portals.  Jon Pertwee's Doctor was always at his best when indignant, and here he has a pretty hammy villain to point his finger and lecture at.
There are no monsters in this story -- no alien monsters, anyway.  The Solonian mutants (costume-designed by Doctor Who's Academy Award winner, James Acheson), lurch and screech a lot, but they never kill.  They're benign creatures.  The villain (fittingly, for such a progressive story) looks eerily like Rush Limbaugh, and, with his plan to gut Solos of its native atmosphere, while strip-mining the planet of its fuel, plays like a caricature of the Bush/Cheney administration.  Paul Whitsun-Jones, as the Marshal, is one of ""Doctor Who""'s least credible villains, but because of that, he's also one of the most quotable.
The Baker/Martin script is pretty weak (apart from the Doctor's diatribes).  In fact, the Marshal is best remembered for something he never really said -- a line of dialogue only present in the novelization by Terrance Dicks.  ""It was a booby-trap, Jaeger, and you were the booby.""  Jaeger is the Marshal's mad scientist, a morally ambiguous bad guy woodenly dragged through the story by George Pravda's heavily Czech accent.  Speaking of accents, the variable-voiced John Hollis (Professor Sondergaard) plays two accents in the story, none of them his own.  And, in a story about segregation, one of the main characters is a black man, significantly named Cotton.  Unfortunately, Cotton is played by the worst actor of the lot, and the only noteworthy cliffhanger in ""The Mutants"" is brought to life (so to speak) by Rick James' disastrous line reading: ""We'll all be done for!""
One aspect of this story still doesn't make sense.  The Doctor arrives on Solos on a mission for the Time Lords.  He's supposed to deliver ancient tablets to Solonian terrorist/freedom-fighter Ky.  So, how did the Time Lords get the tablets?  Just what is their interest in the mutations on Solos?  At the end of the story, Ky evolves into a higher power, which we learn is the birthright of all Solonians.  But we never learn why this affects the Time Lords.  Many ""Doctor Who"" TV stories were later sequelized in print or on audio.  However, no-one has yet displayed enough interest in ""The Mutants"" to follow up on this loose thread.  I'm not exactly waiting to find out.",1069545600,4,3904,4.899543378995434
2725668,5,B0000AGQ2A,"Upon seeing the old bearded man running towards the screen through the mist and bushes at the onset of the story, no, it isn't the ""It's..."" man from Monty Python's first season.  Rather, it's a mutant native of Solos, derogatorily called ""Mutts"" by the Marshal of Solos.
The appearance of a small sphere resembling a cross between a basketball and a coconut is a three-line whip from the Time Lords to the Doctor, a task that's an emergency.  The TARDIS takes the Doctor and Jo to a Skybase hovering over Solos in the 30th century Earth Empire.  ""Once [Earth] sacked the solar system, they moved on to pastures new.  Solos is one of them, one of the last [to gain independence].  Did you ever read Gibbons' Decline and Fall?... Empires rise and empires fall.""
They instantly fall in trouble.  The Marshal, the blustering, stout colonial ruler of Solos with piggish eyes and expression, is stunned to hear that Earth is finally giving Solos its independence.  ""We can't afford an empire anymore.  Earth is exhausted, finished, politically, economically, and biologically,"" says the Administrator (Geoffrey Palmer).  In a panic, the Marshal has the Administrator murdered, then imposes martial law to continue his reign over Solos, which has been exploited for its thaesium.  Ky, leader of the more radical natives, is not only framed for the murder, but the sphere is intended for him.
The Doctor, Jo, and Ky are befriended by two of the Marshal's guards, Stubbs and Cotton, who learn of the Marshal's plot and see Solos as a ""stinking rotting hole"" that should've been given independence years ago.  The planet is grey, but that's nothing compared to the Doctor's description of 30th century Earth, ""land and sea alike, all grey.  Grey cities linked by grey highways across grey deserts.  Slag, ash, and clinker.  The fruits of technology.""  Hmm, sounds like 20th century Earth to me.
But the Marshal also has a dream to turn Solos's atmosphere into one breathable for humans and to heck with the Solonians.  Experiments by his scientist Jaeger has caused pollutions that have caused the mutations among Solonians.  At least, that's the ostensible explanation.  ""Genocide as a side effect?  You ought to write a paper on that, professor,"" the Doctor angrily tells Jaeger.  As for the mutants, they resemble giant, grey, large-eyed armoured insectoids.
Paul Whitsun-Jones pulls in a strong performance as the sadistic Marshal, accused by the Doctor as being responsible for ""one of the most brutal and callous series of crimes against a defenseless people it's been my misfortune to encounter.""  Indeed, the Marshal ranks as one of the most heinous villains in Doctor Who's history.  When told he is quite mad by the Doctor, he replies calmly, ""Only if I lose.""  And George Pravda (Jaeger) would later play Castellan Spandrell in The Who story The Deadly Assassin.
There are three elements in this story comparable to The Empire Strikes Back.  One, the navy blue uniforms and helmets of the guards are similar to that of the Bespin Guards.  Two, the Skybase and Cloud City float above their respective planets.  Three, John Hollis, who plays Dr. Sondegaard here, also played Lando Calrissian's bald android assistant, Lobot.  And speaking of Star Wars, Garrick Hagon (Ky) played Biggs Darklighter, Luke's best friend from Tatooine who ends up being toast in the Death Star battle.
Also, this was the story Saladin Chamcha watches in Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, only it was mistakenly called The Mutilasians.
Despite being criticized for its overlength and bad performances, this allegory on the fall of the British Empire and apartheid is thematic of British guilt in the 70's for exploiting native peoples, and a striking Pertwee story, well worth its six episodes.  John Hollis, Rick James-no, not the Superfreak, (Cotton), and Christopher Coll (Stubbs) lend credible support.  The mutants are effectively realized, with the Doctor and the lovable Jo still a great team.",1067558400,10,3981,5.0628834355828225
2725669,5,B0000AGQ2A,"This is one of the Third Doctor's best episodes!

An empire is in decay and a world is left ravaged by the evils of colonialism.  The Doctor goes against the ruthless Marshal of the planet Solos and works to uncover the mystery behind the monstrous mutation of the Solonian people.  The Marshall rules Solos from his orbiting Skybase and will stop at nothing to prevent the weary Earth Empire from retracting and granting Solos its independence.

2725681,1,B0000AGQ2A,"I have never seen any episodes of the sixth Doctor, but of all the Who I've seen, Jon Pertwee is the absolute worst.  He takes himself so seriously that the inherent absurdity of ""Doctor Who"" is reduced to a ponderous and tedious trial of the senses.  His total lack of humor is so at odds with the goofy plots and ridiculous monster costumes that it is impossible for me to enjoy his episodes.  I think he saw himself as a ""Danger Man"" character, and he portrayed the Doctor with all the seriousness that Patrick McGoohan did in his series.  ""The Mutants,"" in particular, is so long I couldn't make myself finish it when it got to Part Six.  It's not that complex a story, and could have been wrapped up in the conventional four parts--three, if there had been any mercy.  Jon Pertwee--worst Doctor ever.",1355529600,,805,4.517241379310345

8166560,5,B0000AGQ2A,"A fascinating classic masterpiece of the Jon Pertwee era!
An absolute epic and very thoughtfully made.
Excellent production, directed by a Master Storyteller, Christopher Barry in a pleasantly cinematic way.
Some of the scenes were shot with distortion, curious but effective.
This is a very sophisticated story with a number of characters and creatures, all are unique.
There are elements of political, social, ecological and mutation (?) issues throughout and I feel they are presented in a realistic manner.
This story opens with an old man running from danger ala Monty Python! A funny but unintentional (subconscious?) homage. We see this character reappear later after his death, inexplicably. Maybe I missed something.
The Mutt creatures (mutants) are some of the best ever designed for Doctor Who by James Acheson, a very accomplished professional now. He also designed a host of others for 36 Who stories including Sontarans and Zygons.
Acheson is also responsible for the complete look, scarf and all of the fourth Doctor, Tom Baker!
Impressive.

This story is a little slow and deliberate in some places but Barry always finds interesting ways to use the camera. It sometimes is necessary to linger a bit for atmosphere.
The spacecraft scenes are excellent, as are its interior sets.
Jo Grant, the Doctor's companion/assistant looks wonderful here.
Very attractive.

Disc 2 in this release features a Making Of documentary, Mutt Mad; Dressing Doctor Who, a documentary of designer James Acheson's association with Who and Race Against Time, a documentary about non-white actors in Doctor Who and British television.
Race Against Time is interesting but the scope of it goes well beyond Doctor Who, it does seem to have a specific agenda.
Maybe this is someone's politically correct way of apologizing?
I was disappointed to learn something known for its Liberalism, the BBC, produced a series known as The Black And White Minstrel Show from 1958-1979. Yes, white actors in classic stereotypical Blackface and NO actual black actors were employed.
Very puzzling and foolish. The time of this silly cartoonish stereotype had long since passed by 1958.
Other BBC programs featuring non-white actors prominently where also being produced at the same time.
I can't see the balance, I mean, why bother with something so backward and known to be offensive?

All this being said one of the most interesting performances in The Mutants is the role of Cotton, portrayed by black actor Rick James, not the Superfreak musician.
I do find the lack of ethnicity in classic Doctor Who questionable.
It doesn't make sense.
