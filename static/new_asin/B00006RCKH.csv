8278620,3,B00006RCKH,"By the name of this video, you might hope to see the top pro-skaters battle it out at a skatepark comp. for the title and the cash. Needless to say ""side-show bob wanker"" Ellis hosts this unmotivated group of ""nobody really has time for this"" videos. The show kicks off with Danny Ways' insane trickory of pulling a 65' launch air into 18'3"" vert air - sick. Things slide off after that. Mike V., Hawk, Rowley, Koston and Burnquist follow up with thier own dreamed up stunts. You are given a bio. on each boarder which slows the pace down a bit, but the music saves the action from flat-spotting. Burnquists' ""top off the loop"" front side air gives everybody the run for the moolah, in this ""cool if it was for free handout like t-shirts and stickers"" DVD.",1065830400,3,756,4.446043165467626
