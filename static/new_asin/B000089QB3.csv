1831702,5,B000089QB3,"All the magic school bus movies are great and so much information. Both my 3 year old boy and my 7 year old girl love them and so do I.

 For everyone!!",1147651200,2,152,3.71875
1831703,5,B000089QB3,My five year old grandson just loves the Magic School Bus.  Every time he watches and episode he learns something new.  Great item!,1142812800,,131,4.6521739130434785
1831704,5,B000089QB3,"""The Magic School Bus"" series is classic modern education! With 3 space-themed episodes, your child or class is sure to expand their knowledge base and have an entertaining experience, all at the same time! This DVD version is packed with ""extras"" to further the learning experience. ""Space Adventures"" lives up to ""School Bus"" standards.

I suggest purchasing the related ""School Bus"" books to accompany this DVD.",1134259200,4,414,5.2727272727272725
1831705,4,B000089QB3,"We love the Lost in Space Episode, the other two don't hold the kids attention quite as well (they're smaller than the target age, only 3&4,but usually do very well with these).  I'm hoping they'll grow into them, since both episodes are pretty good.  Although is isn't our favorite of the MSB DVDs, it was money well spent.  No problems with the sound or video quality.",1132963200,2,370,4.575757575757576
1831706,5,B000089QB3,"Seeing that my son enjoyed Magic Schoolbus on Discovery Kids, I decided to by this DVD for him.

I certainly wasn't disappointed!

Arnold's know-it-all cousin Janet drives the whole class crazy when she joins Ms. Frizzle's class on a field trip and the Magic Schoolbus gets LOST IN SPACE!

After Dorothy Ann sees an asteroid on a crash course toward their school, the class blasts into space. Will they be ablet to divert the asteroid and save the day? Find out in the OUT OF THIS WORLD adventure!

In TAKING FLIGHT, Wanda and the rest of the class discover how wings and moving air cause flight as they are shrunk inside Tim's model airplane.

This DVD is 82 minutes and features a TAKE A FIELD TRIP interactive adventure (where your child can learn about the Solar System and the secrets of flight), a space adventure maze, and more.

My 6 year old really enjoys this DVD and has learned quite a lot from it. The sound quality is great, and definitely worth the affordable price.",1096675200,17,981,4.577142857142857

They are great movies for car rides. Also, it is truely and investment in their education as well. My boys have impressed teachers with what they've learned from Magic School Bus. We have books too! I think they enjoy reading the books even more because they can easily picutre the characters from the show. I had all of the episodes recorded on my DVR, but we have moved. I could re-record all of them, but that's not portable. There are three episodes per DVD-it's worth the $!",1323129600,,646,4.260162601626016

My sister has one of the Magic School Bus DVDs that Ashton watches often.  I decided to get him The Magic School Bus: Space Adventures and we have hard time turning it off.  He is 2 and 1/2 now and is mesmerized by The Magic School Bus: Space Adventures.

I want to buy more but there are not a lot of reviews so I am not sure which to get next.

I definitely have already gotten my money's worth, and it's only February.  The Magic School Bus series is a really good one from an education standpoint, as well as an entertainment one.

1831772,5,B000089QB3,"This DVD is one of my daughter's favorites.  As she says, ""It rocks!""  I suppose I am to blame for that exclamation.  The DVD can be played in Spanish, so she watches one episode in Spanish on weekends to reinforce her second-language skills.  Lily Tomlin does not do the Spanish version, but it is still very good.  Highly recommended.  It is great for a 4-year olds conversation starter (as opposed to ""poop,"" ""boogers,"" and ""pootie"" (fart).",1194220800,,443,4.7631578947368425

Oh, yes, the animation is good, the story is okay, but the way some of the characters speak to each other is horrible! And there's no lesson about talking ""nice"" to each other. Children need as much modeling of respect for others, including their peers, as we can give them, not the nasty tones displayed in this movie.",1186099200,11,439,4.569620253164557
