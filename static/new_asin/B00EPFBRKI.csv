No kitchen gadgetry (at least motorized ones)! Simple honest food prepared the old-fashioned way in an open hearth. One thing I remember was the Chef remarking ""People ask me all the time what the Founders actually ate, and all I can say is that I don't know but I do know what was served."" (in that time everything was served family-style in big bowls that were passed from person to person each serve themselves).

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the sweetbreads (if you don't know, you don't want to know!). I guess back in the old days most people just couldn't afford to waste any part of the animal...

What's unusual about this cooking show is the historicity of its settings. In each show, between courses, the viewer is taken out of the kitchen to some historic site for a short tour of the environment from which the food originated. One show featured a visit to a revolutionary battlefield where a meal was prepared ""in the field"" at a camp (bivouac). Another show featured George Washington's field tent from which he commanded the Continental Army (it has been preserved). Other notables who served as subjects of the show included Martha Washington,  Betsy Ross, and Thomas Jefferson to name just a few (I've not yet watched all the series so undoubtedly there are many others as well). Other places gone to include historic buildings, hotels, restaurants, etc. where the various revolutionary principals discussed and planned the war and the fledgling American government. At most of these places a knowledgeable guide or character actor narrates with the historical detail. In a few of the shows the Chef visits farms and gardens and explains what kinds of animals and vegetables were cultivated during revolutionary times.

BTW Chef Staib runs the City Tavern restaurant in Philadelphia's historic district. The website has their menu posted on it, as well the Chef's other media offerings.",1486512000,,2174,5.404129793510324
