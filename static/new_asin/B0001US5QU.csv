8016247,2,B0001US5QU,"Bastof Syndrome is well... a rather sour show and I'm guessing it's because it's based around a game called... the ""Lemon"" game. This show had an ok concept that might intrigue people at first. To be honest I'm a fairly optimistic person, but this show is just such a disappointment. Anyone who has an ear for music could probably tell this show was going to suck from the start. Hearing either the opening or closing theme songs could make a person go like ""what were they thinking of putting this s*** in here."" Well that's just me at least.

More importantly the show's story is a bit childish and overstretches the time period between the hero in his ""denial of what's going on"" phase and ""finally does something about it"" phase. It takes almost seven episodes before Pseudo (the hero) decides to actually get the guts to fight in the game again. Also this show crosses along the lines of being an ultra crappy version of The Matrix and Code Lyoko ( A show that premiered on cartoon network, that's a lot better than this)combined. As where they find this virtual world to be real and they could actually die if they lose and the physical world can be damaged as a result of their battles.

When it comes to the artwork here it's rather mediocre to me. I was willing to let it slide at first, but now it seems annoying. They tried to give the characters a semi-realistic look that seemed to come out a little retarded for some and ok for others. Also the mecha designs weren't bad but that's about all I can say about this show positively.

Overall this show has a concept that may have worked out if it were executed better. This isn't really worth checking out with the lack of action, poor character designs for some, the hero's name being Pseudo, ( why would you name your hero ""fake"" ?) that screaming chick, and the petty obsession over the ""lemon"" game which the three main characters don't even play half the time. This show truly is a disappointment which could have been avoided  with proper execution as some tell me. Do your best not to see this show. If you do though you may actually get into it if you don't mind waiting until the series is half-way through to see something. That's all, I hope this review was helpful.",1099440000,3,2238,4.477941176470588
