1634665,4,B00005NKSP,"David E. Kelley's magical scripting in Ally McBeal was predated by this early Judd Nelson star vehicle, somewhat fresh off his ""Breakfast Club"" fame.  While it's completely preposterous that any lawyers would be able to bark at judges and defendants alike, you can't deny this is an entertaining movie.
It's a bit talky at times, and the ending is somewhat anti-climactic, but it's got a few things going for it; the script, a decent mix of comedy and drama, and John Hurt as the ambiguous Douglas Benoit--his best role since his turn as ""Caligula"" of ""I, Claudius"" fame.",1070236800,,571,4.826530612244898
1634666,5,B00005NKSP,"This is an odd film.  It contains some of the most funny moments a courtroom has ever seen (""a hearing to decide the admissability of the word 'ass'?  I love it!"") combined with one of the most distrubing psycho portrayls I've seen.  John Hurt is magnificently unnerving in his acting, while Judd manages to carry some of the most memorable courtroom antics ever.  And I didn't even mention the DA's dildo....",1042070400,,409,4.71830985915493
1634667,5,B00005NKSP,"You know, back in the day when I first loved this, I just loved it.  NOW I realize that this movie was the groundbreaker for the dude who does Ally McBeal and The Practice.  No wonder I like those shows too!
Judd Nelson is really excellent in this movie.  Of course I love Judd in anything.  But this is one of those comedies which makes you think.  You start out with a lot of great laughs but then later on it really takes on the philosophy of law and the justice system.  All the while, keeping you informed and entertained.
This film has murder, mayhem, truth and daring.  You will really be able to sink your teeth into this one.  I wore out my VHS copy of it ages ago and was thrilled to be able to replace it with DVD.  Buy it and you won't be sorry!",1006473600,6,757,4.0608108108108105

The man who played the defendant did some good acting, too. Ah, and it was refreshing to watch a movie that didn't have a whole lot of profanity, blasphemy or taking of the Lord's name in vain.

The only subtraction was that they tried to make an anti-Republican statement during a couple of the dialogues.  Don't get me wrong, I don't care much about politics, but I don't think movies should ever do that.  The purpose of a movie is mostly for entertainment; they shouldn't try to slip political agendas into it, even slightly.  However, other than that, the acting was excellent and the story was interesting throughout, with a nice surprise at the end.

1634848,3,B00005NKSP,"I typically love a David E. Kelley legal dramady; I'm especially addicted to The Practice.  Thus, when I found this forgotten film was Kelley's first foray into film scriptwriting, coupled with my intense feeling of under-appreciation for Judd Nelson as an actor, I just had to believe I'd stumble onto a lost gem.  The film has all of Kelley's trademarks of whimsy, tongue-in-cheek humor and not-so-subtle righteous indignation for the legal profession.  Yet, From the Hip is just too scripted and contrived to even stretch the best limits of believability. Wooden script aside, one wishes Judd Nelson had done more sly-comedy work in the '80s.  He's ripe for a comeback on a well-written TV series.  I'm casting my vote now.",1417651200,,726,5.016666666666667
1634849,2,B00005NKSP,"SPOILERS.

Before the dramatic ending of this movie, I would have given it 5 stars. Attractive actors, well written, clever, and quite enjoyable. But the ending completely ruined it for me.

I am a retired trial lawyer and, relevant to this movie, was co-author of a code of ethics promulgated by the American Bar Association and the American Arbitration Association. The protagonists conduct at the end of the climactic murder trial was unethical,  despicable, indeed disbarrable. He deliberately trapped his own client into behavior that would convict him of a capital crime which, as far as he (the lawyer) knew, he did not commit  certainly he had consistently denied guilt. I cannot imagine more outrageous conduct by a lawyer.

A client must be able to trust that his lawyer has his best interests at heart. This lawyer did not. This lawyer came to the conclusion, perhaps erroneously, that his client was guilty. It was his obligation, if he felt unable to continue defending him, to ask the courts permission to withdraw as counsel. Instead, he pretended to continue defending him while in fact utterly undermining his defense. The idea that the guilty verdict was some sort of victory for the defendants attorney, a bizarre notion on its face, is a travesty. Nor was this any kind of victory for society, as was suggested  our legal system is set up to be adversarial, and no one gains when one of the adversaries surreptitiously joins the opposition. The judge should have declared a mistrial after she saw what the defendants lawyer did  and sent his name to the bar authorities for consideration of disbarment.",1417564800,,1622,4.9411764705882355

1634891,4,B00005NKSP,"First saw FROM THE HIP back in 1988 (it was released a year earlier in theatres) or so off a Canadian ""premium channel"" (First Choice) and liked it so much that I scanned the cable listings to find out when it wd be next aired, and then recorded it ""off air"".  Over the next year or so, I watched it a few more times, but, after a move, misplaced that VHS tape and pretty much forgot all about this flick (now that I think of it, there must have been some reason why it never aired on ""free"" tv - at least not while I was watching).

Twenty plus years later, while looking for a dvd on kijiji, saw that someone had one of these dvds for sale and, of course, I promptly went to Amazon (Canada) and ordered one.  While the extras are nonexistent and the picture is widescreen with no option for fullscreen (why is a legal dramedy in widescreen, anyway?), the dvd was worth it becuz it reminded me why I enjoyed this Judd Nelson ""vehicle"" so much in the first place.

Since other reviewers have already gone into the plot I'll just note that one of the things that made FROM THE HIP so interesting was the casting of stellar supporting actors, many of whom are well known to tv and movies viewers, even if few of them  played a lead role in anything, actors such as Edward Winter and Alan Arbus (""Colonel Flagg"" and ""Sydney Freedman"", respectively, from M*A*S*H), Ray Walston (""Mr. Hand"" from FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH), Darren McGavin (KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER and several good X-FILES eps), Nancy Marchand (LOU GRANT and THE NAKED GUN series), and Beatrice Winde (can't remember any ""big roles"", but have seen her in a couple LAW & ORDER eps).  Since many of them have, unfortunately, passed on since this film was made, it's nice to see them at the top of their games in HIP.

And, while some antics/scenes are quite over the top in this young-lawyer-trying-to-make-a-name-for-himself story, the screenplay, on the whole, is a good one.  Never bothered to catch who wrote FROM THE HIP when I first saw this one, but the name David E. Kelley leapt out from the screen this time around and, if memory serves, he's the person behind ALLY McBEAL, so those of you who are sitting on the fence about buying this dvd but are Kelley fans will prob like this one ('tho, to be sure, there aren't any stick figured women in HIP and the lead isn't neurotic).

All in all, a solid four star movie ('tho a 3 star dvd).  Enjoy",1348272000,,2416,4.421171171171171

Judd Nelson plays very well his role of a ""would be"" lawyer and convinces both as a comedian, in the first 30 minutes or so with the help support of his mates, as when it moves to drama, with the giant support help from John Hurt acting as Professor Benoit. Much entertaining and thought provoking, with a final scene difficult to anticipate, but sure enough to close all gaps left.

1634910,5,B00005NKSP,"We gave away our video tape of this movie, but ordered ourselves the DVD!  Good acting, good moral to the story, intense, funny, dramatic, thoughtful.  Great movie--we'll never give THIS DVD away!",1256601600,,196,5.09375
1634911,4,B00005NKSP,"Fantastic movie.  Up there with My Cousin Vinny.  Skewers big firm life in humorous fashion, and then turns on a dime to present a compelling criminal legal thriller.  A great, underappreciated movie.",1234915200,,200,5.1875
1634912,5,B00005NKSP,"This is a fun movie, and they're so hard to find in video stores now!",1213488000,,69,3.6666666666666665
1634913,5,B00005NKSP,Have loved this film for years. Having worked in the legal profession I can appreciate the humour and it was so good to finally get a DVD copy. The service from Amazon amazing.,1210204800,,176,4.363636363636363
1634914,5,B00005NKSP,This is fantastic acting from all participants.  It's just been one of my favorite movies for a long time now!!,1197504000,,111,4.55
1634925,4,B00005NKSP,"It's hard to believe I never saw of this film growing up. I saw all the other ""Brat Pack"" movies but , I never even heard of this. I was happy to sit down and see a cast of actors who would become more famous in later years. The film's first act has some very funny(and ridiculous!)court rooms shenanigans and then it turns to a little more serious side. The film flips back to more outrageous comedy and then gets kind of dark, it's all a little uneven to say the least but, I did enjoy it. If your a fan of Judd Nelson you should check this out.",1194652800,,547,4.027522935779817
1634926,2,B00005NKSP,"I remember seeing this just once back in the 80s and thinking it was fantastic - then saw these reviews and thought I just had to see it again. Disappointed!!! Is the acting that great? The script is clunky and it has a real ""mediocre midday movie"" feel about it - check out the titles!?  Just about ANY episode of Boston Legal (or The Practice for that matter - note David E Kelley credits on this film) has a more engaging plot.",1194134400,,430,4.2439024390243905
1634927,4,B00005NKSP,A little uneven but worth the ride if you like Judd Nelson and Ray Walston.  The supporting cast is great too.  A lot of laughs mixed with some intense drama.,1191888000,,158,4.233333333333333
1634928,5,B00005NKSP,Great movie it arrived when it said it would and was in great shape. Very happy.,1191456000,,80,4.0625
1634929,4,B00005NKSP,The film is something that has enough twists that it is interesting to see what comic relief the legal system could have..and what someone can do with it.,1188950400,,154,4.535714285714286
1634930,5,B00005NKSP,"I like this movie because rather than gimics, it tells an interesting story.  Plus the acting is wonderful, the writing very clever and the casting is perfect.  It's got everything.  Bob Clark directs.  I would rank this as one of my favorite movies of all time.",1175904000,2,262,4.630434782608695
1634931,4,B00005NKSP,"This movie stars Judd Nelson as Robin ""Stormy"" Weathers, an impatient but brillant young attorney looking to climb up the law firm ladder.  The movie follows the exploits of Stormy Weathers and has some of the most amusing legal wrangling of all time.  The screenplay was written by David E. Kelly of Ally McBeal fame so of course, it is set in Boston.  It is a nice balance of comedy and drama.",1154390400,,395,4.458333333333333
1634932,5,B00005NKSP,"I have been looking for this movie for a long, long time.  It was in great condition and arrived when expected.  Thank you.",1151798400,,123,4.304347826086956
1634933,4,B00005NKSP,Very surprising plot line. I'm not easily surprised being a Sherlock Holmes fan.,1142294400,,80,5.230769230769231
1634934,4,B00005NKSP,"Judd Nelson has made some good movies and some not so good. I count this as one of his best. As an attorney ""Stormy Weathers"" he can't be beat. He will stretch the limits of courtroon etiquette well past the limit if it will win his case. This is by far one of the best melodramas I have seen. Not often do we see a movie full of comedy and drama at the same time.

The beginning is very light stuff, but midway into the movie we start to see the darkside of humanity. John Hurt turns in a magnificent performance as Judd's client in a murder case. Judd can't decide if his client is innocent or guilty, but once he knows for sure he has to learn new tactics in dealing with the judicial system.

Fans of courtroom movies should enjoy this even if they are not fans of the 80s bratpack. Great directing and excellent cast make this a winner. A nice soundtrack and scenes in Boston don't hurt either. Good quality DVD but no extras.",1111536000,15,931,4.224719101123595
7947383,4,B00005NKSP,There is alot of movies you can't get here in Australia and this was one of them. It will fit nicely in my movie collection along with kuffs and firebirds excellent.,1525219200,,165,4.354838709677419
7947384,5,B00005NKSP,"I first saw this as a movie script, in the agency where I worked, and read it cover to cover in an hour or so. Loved every second, and couldn't wait for it to be made.

When it got made, it was even better--because the script had ended on a note that wouldn't have worked at all. The final, very satisfying ending of the movie just made the rest of it better.

It's funny and smart and surprising, and one of David Kelley's first movie scripts. Remember him? He's worth watching.

A great guilty pleasure I still enjoy, all these years later:

""Truth be damned.""

""Truth? What is this woman talking about? This is the law.""

A great line we should all take to heart.",1524528000,,666,4.288

7947390,5,B00005NKSP,LOVE LOVE this movie.  This movie has been a favorite in my family for years.  One of those movies no one has heard of but you should because it is great.  Very funny comedy that turns into a drama at the end.,1493769600,,209,3.9285714285714284
