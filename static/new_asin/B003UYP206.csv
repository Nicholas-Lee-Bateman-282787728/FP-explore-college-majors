4207782,5,B003UYP206,"Hello, I normally don't write reviews but want to for this film as it did not get much press. It is a shame, it should have as it is a very well made, smart drama political thriller.

Trade Routes offers many viewers something they need to know and need to think about.

But this film is worth checking out as the acting was good, the directing was good, the film looked amazing - perhaps due to the locations - but it did really look well.

This type of film makes you question many things and it is must see so please check it out ASAP, thanks.",1306195200,7,546,4.132075471698113

4207784,4,B003UYP206,Good espionage movie. Better than fake actions and adventures!,1415318400,,62,6.0
4207785,5,B003UYP206,"This is an unusually well crafted film in every respect. The characters--the whole cast-- is believable. The plot is quietly riveting. Better than the John le Carr films, save for Tinker, Tailor, and I'd rank with the 'Good Shepard' for historical faithfulness.",1400457600,2,261,5.238095238095238
4207786,4,B003UYP206,"The viewers of this movie were pretty much spot on. Always enjoy watching foreign movies, and this one did not disappoint. The length of this movie was just right.
 So if your into a spy/drama movie just click.",1390003200,2,210,4.526315789473684
4207787,5,B003UYP206,"I saw this at the Chicago Film festival a few years ago, and it remains an excellent, sublte political thriller set in Bulgaria.  The actors - both the Americans and the legendary Bulgarians - are well cast, and the plot how power while avoiding melodrama.

Watch it!",1375747200,2,267,4.659574468085107
4207788,2,B003UYP206,"A political thriller; not much in the way of action at all. But if you're into some mind games, this is probably worth your time.  Set in Bulgaria and the scenery is pleasing; definitely eastern European if Bulgaria is not the actual set.  One or two actors are very good; the others average.  The plot is shallow and simple enough, but has some twists that bring some unexpected turns.
An election is reaching the end game and political forces clash in a mix of old school cold war intelligence games and western influence peddling.  The down side is that America is once again played as the corrupt snake in the grass attempting to circumvent the ""free processes of an independent nation"".  Though not a Hollywood flick, it's definitely of their mindset.  A more interesting and realistic view would have been to actually incorporate historical forces that helped to make that nation what it is today.  That may have been a bit too much work, however.
2.5 - 3 stars.",1358726400,7,968,4.6923076923076925
4207789,5,B003UYP206,"If you're not crazy about sub-titles,don't let that stop you from watching. The film is half English and half sub-titles. But there IS enough time to read them. Excellent political thriller.",1358380800,2,190,5.161290322580645
4207790,4,B003UYP206,"a very interesting and realistic picture about life in Sofia,Bugaria//fiendishly demanding your

show. worth watching if only for the fiendishly clever way this picture keeps your rapt
attention.",1354924800,,289,5.304347826086956

4207792,5,B003UYP206,"A real spy movie; no chase/fight seens or death defying stunts or wow factor gadgets, but the most realistic portrail of how compeating interests and organizations use and abuse everyone they touch. Grity real world political intregue at its best. This movie is a must see; put your thinking cap on, pay attention, and get ready to have your eyes opened!",1324598400,11,354,4.819672131147541

8406280,4,B003UYP206,"Well made, with an interesting plot. Two negative aspects: subtitles for half the movie -- if I want to read a story I'll get a book; it felt quite rushed, and it was good enough to be at least twice as long -- George Martin (""Game of Thrones""), at the other extreme, would have made it twelve seasons long. Other than those two things it was an absorbing 100 minutes that was certainly closer to reality than the great majority of ""spy"" movies, and points out, without belaboring it, that The CIA works out of State Dept. facilities (which former directors James Woolsey and Michael Hayden concede, indirectly, via their recommendations of the novel ""Agents of Innocence"").",1473552000,,674,4.769230769230769

8406288,3,B003UYP206,"In Bulgaria there are undercover agents, political manipulators and bankers chasing something. What?  Most of all, the many interested parties had me wondering who was doing the right thing. Its a complicated movie to understand and every word needed to be heard if I could, so closed captioning helped me hear what was said when certain characters started mumbling or just unintelligible. Not sure what happened but the movie ended and I had to look it up on IMDB to remember what it was I watched.",1428710400,,499,4.8023255813953485
