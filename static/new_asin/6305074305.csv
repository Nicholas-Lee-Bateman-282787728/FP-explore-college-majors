977860,5,6305074305,"Dear God, why was this movie ever made? Possibly the worst film ever put on celluoid--or, to be accurate, the cheaper equivalent to it. The acting is pathetic: ""Look at all the wonderful food they have prepared for  us!!""-- Mother telling her husband about the food scattered around the  house, all of which looks as if it is toxic. ""MOM!! I just discovered  something!! NILBOG is goblin spelled backwords!!""-- Joshua(I'm not  sure why I remember his name). Trust me, buy this film simply because it is  unintentionally hilarious. The costumes are pathetic(You can see the faces  of the actors beneath the troll masks). At one point the witch has her arm  chopped off, and a plastic stump becomes its replacement(Ouch). As if that  weren't bad enough, you can see someone offscreen pulling it from her hand  as it is regenerated!!! The worst is yet to come: The same witch mentioned  above(I don't know how she ever received a part in any film, let alone this  one. She's that bad), makes green milkshakes for young boys to drink,  turning them all into trees!! Buy this thing.....Now.",921542400,2,1085,4.805405405405406
977861,5,6305074305,"Troll Two is possibly the best movie of all time.  When I first saw this movie on HBO I wondered, 'why would HBO show such garbage?'  Then, after about three viewings, I was enamored by it's magic.  My friends and I have  viewed this masterpiece over thirty times.  Such great flaws in the film  include, ""where is everyone?  No one is out at this time of night (yet  it is high noon)"", the NILBOG police car driven by Sherrif Gene Freak  only has one Nilbog logo on it. And it mysteriosly switches sides of the  car througout the movie, and the ever popular, shirt opening and closing  act.  You will just have to watch this great movie to appreciate about what  I am talking. ""where is that damn  mirror?""--Farmer Waites",920851200,2,722,4.453846153846154

978019,3,6305074305,Im sorry but I can't explain why I gave this movie 3 stars. This has to be the worst acted movie. The worst costumes. And the dumbest people. But for some reason I really liked it. I guess it's just so bad it's good. I guess it's a good movie to make fun of or watch when your drunk. I know a lot of people will think I'm rediculous for even giving this movie three stars. But you have to give one even to leave a bad review and I don't really count that.

978021,1,6305074305,"I stumbled across the documentary ""Best Worst Film"" about the making of ""Troll 2"" and it's what prompted me to buy this two disc Blu-ray edition. It looked like fun! I love cult films like Rocky Horror, Eraserhead, Plan 9 from Outer Space, The Room, Pink Flamingos, Re-Animator, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Etc ... so I thought I'd see what this was about.

And I just don't get why people like this film. It is absolutely awful by any measure, but not in an entertaining way.

It's just stupid. Really really stupid. Not funny-stupid. Not clever-stupid. It's more like brain-damaged-stupid.

This is the only Blu-ray / DVD I have ever taken directly out of the player after watching and thrown in the trash. I don't want anyone I know IRL to see it in my collection, nor do I want anyone in my family to find it in my collection after I'm dead and gone. This fairly anonymous review / warning to others will be the only evidence that I wasted $7 and 90 minutes on this cinematic atrocity.

It's just really, really stupid.",1503878400,,1020,4.557377049180328

978144,5,6305074305,"Words cannot express how amazingly horrible this movie is. It is truly masterpiece of horrible cinema. I bought this so my friends and I could poke fun at something in our spare time, and it does not disappoint.

Any story about how a young boy who pees on his dinner is the only sane one in his entire family and has to fight against rural, vegan, Protestant, Celtic, human devouring goblins that look like they came straight out of Dungeons and Dragons practically DESERVES to be a part of your family's movie collection.

If that does not convince you, here are some highlights:
1. A teenager is seduced into becoming popcorn.
2. Quotable yet terrible quotes.
3. Unnecessary plot twists.
4. Goblins with a plant-based diet that eat humans...somehow.
5. Obvious anti-vegan propaganda (and I'm not vegan).
6. A teenager is seduced into becoming popcorn.

Plan 9 From Outer Space remains king of bad movies nationally but Troll 2 is without a doubt the worst movie ever made in the history of making movies. The acting is horrible, the plot makes no sense, there are NO TROLLS in it and even though it's called Troll 2 there was never a Troll original that this would be a sequel to. The special effects are bad - our haunted house at Halloween is better, the locations are crap and make no sense...  And yet this movie actually gets BETTER every time we watch it! Now even the kids repeat the horribly written lines - ""Nilbog! It's Goblin spelled backwards!"" and right after Joshua asks ""What are you going to do to me daddy?""

Its a lot of fun coming up with interesting food that pertains to the movie and we all just have a blast. The Troll 2 Queen is a very cool and fun lady and I am honored to know her. This movie is especially fun also because it was filmed nearby. Its fun to go for a drive to see the little city of Nilbog and drive by where the house used to be that they traded to stay in. Sadly, it has been torn down now for bigger houses, all in the name of improvement. There is nothing left of the Troll 2 Queens house but crumbling walls. However, the little strip mall that was the Nilbog store is still intact and was actually for sale last time we drove by. Fun movie. Dont expect too much.

TROLL 2 has been on my to be watched list since I first heard about it six years ago, and I finally saw it recently. It is totally enjoyable and delivers laughs and disbelief in spades. Not even the numerous online reviews and spoilers could stop my shock.

The plot and the characters have been talked about so often, so I'm going to highlight some of my favorite scenes. The ""Oh my god!"" scene is my top pick--I have seen it so many times and I still laugh. There's also the scene between the over the top woman and a young boy, who is supposed to be sixteen or so, making out...while eating a corn cob...and their passion is so intense that popcorn starts flying through the air. I mean, that's pretty amazing. I also liked the method that's revealed to destroy the goblins. Who knew thinking of being good could be used as a weapon?

While this movie is in a class all on its own, I wasn't as fascinated with this movie as I was with THE ROOM and BIRDEMIC. I think if I had seen this one first, my feelings about it would have been different. Still, if you love bad movies, do not skip out on this one.",1456790400,4,1214,4.183760683760684

I like watching terrible films and making fun of them but this one was funny at times and really painful at other times. Some moments were so weird and off the wall that you couldn't help but laugh. However, the film is sometimes so incompetent that it's infuriating. There is one scene-that is clearly shot during the day-and one of the characters say it's night. How hard is it to change one word in a line?! But of course, that's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this movie.

Why would anyone want to eat the green, gooey stuff offered as food, as everyone here does? The acting is horrible like a bunch of really clueless kids in a high school play. The soundtrack is awful, apparently played on a single 80's Casio. The costumes and makeup are laughable. The Trolls (Oh, by the way, they're not Trolls at all, but rather, Goblins) look like rubber masks and burlap that some mom made for her kid on Halloween.

It has a certain fascination to it however. As bad as it is, it never sinks into boredom because every time a  ridiculous scene is over it's followed by an even more ridiculous scene.

980838,5,6305074305,"So bad it's good!

There are a few things you need to know about this movie:
First the director and his wife wrote this movie. Italian is their first language and they speak poor English (according to IMBD). They insisted that the characters go by the script as it was written when the movie was filmed. Second, ALL of the main characters went into the auditions hoping for parts as extras and were given the main character parts.

In this movie, a young boy is hallucinating that his granfather is still alive and trying to help him save his family from trolls. The trolls have managed to turn themselves into human look alikes. This way, when they are hungry, they can go to town and take their pick of tasty humans to eat. Through a house exchange, the Wait family is on the menu. There are any number of ways the trolls can make you digestable for their system, all of which involve turning you into plant slime. Eat the green food and you become green plant slime, drink the green drink- plant slime. And once you are plant slime- you are eaten!

This movie has all the earmarks of a cult classic- poor acting, strange creatures that aren't scary, green food, and someone peeing on the dinner table!

What makes it even better is that it's so quotable. I have started quoting this movie to my children. ""Big Sister, Your a Genius!"" It's a Double-decker Bogna Sandwhich."" etc.

There is very little of redeeming value if you are looking for a true horror movie, a good kids movie, a movie the whole family will enjoy, or really, any kind of movie. Even the gratuitous scenes that show the girl and the boyfriend alone, together- are simply horrible. The only type of person that will enjoy it is those who have an oddball sense of humor, enjoy watching quotable bad movies.

That allows us to ""get into the action,"" providing, of course, that the actors are good and the storyline is more or less plausible.

In this film with its inept actors, you never succeed in that suspension of disbelief.  It is quite impossible to immerse yourself into the story for wincing at each new acting disaster.  I have rarely seen such grotesque overacting and amateurish performances outside of a junior high school play.  The ""actors,"" if we may generously call them that, are further hampered by a very poor storyline which has nothing to do with trolls.

981949,5,6305074305,"In 1994, I saw the film Ed Wood.  I was then introduced to the work of Edward D. Wood, Jr.  His movies have become favourites of mine, not because there are necessarily any redeeming qualities other than the sincerity with which he made them.  Troll 2, which doesn't feature a single troll, is one of these.  I was introduced to this film by the wonderful documentary Best Worst Movie by Michael Paul Stephenson.  Stephenson stars as Joshua in this film.

This film has everything one could want in a bad film.  It has bad acting, cheesy dialogue, an improbable plot, and score which seems to prominently feature a Casio keyboard.  It's a little like seeing a train wreck.  You just can't help but keep looking at the wreck!  So it is with this film.  Most importantly, though, it has a sincerity about it.  The best worst movies, such as Plan 9 From Outer Space and Battlefield Earth were not made badly on purpose.  Ed Wood wasn't out to create horrible movies.  He believed in what he was doing.  It's true here as well.  I'm not sure that one could create a wonderful and wonderfully bad film like this intentionally.  I wish to thank Michael Paul Stephenson for introducing me to this wonderful and wonderfully bad film through his excellent documentary.

I ordered this after watching the documentary BEST WORST MOVIE about the making of this film and the cult status it has achieved (someone in the film referred to it as ""the Facebook generation's ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW""), and the lives of the people who starred in it.  This documentary was quite good and is worth a watch!

The movie features cardboard performances that are pretty funny to watch, some little people in ill-fitting rubber and burlap costumes (who are referred to as goblins, not trolls - in fact, TROLL 2 doesn't feature any trolls and has nothing to do with the original TROLL film), and a premise that is ridiculous and not entirely coherent.  That having been said, it also has a certain 80s horror movie sensibility to it that will make you giggle and remember your childhood days looking for scary treats in your local video stores (which are now all but extinct); this film has a cheese factor that I would compare to CHEERLEADER CAMP.

I recommend watching the documentary first, and then giving this movie a try.  If you lose patience with bad movies easily, it will help give you some context for the terrible movie you're about to see.",1401062400,4,1352,4.631799163179917
981952,5,6305074305,"Let me start by saying that Troll 2, is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Now the reason isn't because it is a great film that set the bar for a generation, it is very much the opposite.  Troll 2 is one of the worst movies of all time, and it is just so bad that it is amazing.  To see what truly makes Troll 2 special isn't just the nonsensical plot, terrible camera work, and obvious lack of directorial experience; no what makes it truly great is the acting.  The acting is ridiculously exaggerated and the spoken dialogue come off as people trying to act poorly on purpose.  Some of the best examples of this are the famous Oh my god! scene and the scene in which the main character comes to the realization that the town, Nilbog, is actually goblin spelled backwards.  Goblins are the main antagonists the film by the way, in fact despite the title, trolls are not in the film, nor are they even mentioned.  Now with all due respect to the actors in this film, the reason the acting is so bad isn't just due to the skill of the actors, but upon doing a bit of research, you will find that the blame more so lies in the insistence of the director to follow his script verbatim, a script which he and his wife wrote while being unable to completely fluently speak English.  To truly understand what I mean, you simply have to either look up a scene on YouTube, or watch the film for yourself, because truly, if ever there was a piece of unintentional greatness, I would have to say this would be a firm contender.",1399420800,,1522,4.2787456445993035

This effect spawned an entire series in Mystery Science Theater 3000, which smartly tried to make lemons into lemonade with all this cultural waste. Troll 2, a movie from the tail end of this heroic era, seems to be created by people who also wanted to capitalize on the bad equals good effect and create the very most goofy B movie of all time.

This movie is so bad on so many level:
Acting - I don't think any of them really had any acting experience before this movie
Directing - how did this dude get funding for this..he is awful!
Writing - maybe because the writers were foreign and something was lost in translation...but uggg.
Color and editing - An actor will be in the forest one moment and as the camera switches you are in a grass field. It's so bad you don't even have to have any knowledge of cinema to know where the errors are
Sound -
Music - perhaps it's just 30 years later..I guess the music is sort of like that from Terminator (the original...that is kinda bad in today's terms)
You name it and it is just bad, bad, bad.

This movie make an Ed Wood movie look like a cinematic masterpiece....well not really but pretty close.

Everything about this movie is a complete train wreck- the plot, the acting, the dialogue, even the sets.

The goblins are vegetarians who are afraid of meat, which makes NO sense whatsoever, because in everything else I've seen that involves Goblins, IE Final Fantasy or Lord of The Rings, the goblins are carnivores. The ONLY thing they did that was decent was some of the makeup effects when this one guy got turned into a human/plant hybrid. His legs became roots, and when he was stuck in the dirt, the makeup they did for his legs looked pretty cool, but that's the only thing they did right. There are some moments in the plot that make no sense, and the special effects when they did a scene with lightning, it looked like they used Microsoft Paint to make the lightning bolt, and the just used the same single bolt over and over and over again. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm racking my brain trying to think of a worse movie, but coming up with nothing.

From the sizzling sexy scene with the Goblin-Queen in a low cut dress and a cob of corn to the use of an entire pack of bologna on a sandwich as a defense against Stonehenge Magic Stone and the forces of evil, this movie will make you laugh, cry, and question your purpose in life.

Written and directed by an Italian husband/wife duo, neither of whom were entirely proficient in the English language, this movie features the talents of several up-and coming (read: completely inexperienced) actors. The special effects team had, I would estimate, a whopping $200 budget for the entire movie. These factors combined add up to one thing: Troll 2, the most excellent movie I have ever viewed.

Buy this movie! You will wear out the disc. Hold Troll 2 parties with green kool-aid and cake, and don't forget that popcorn!

(Available on Netflix) To really appreciate Troll 2 you have to understand that the Italian boneheads who made it thought they were making a decent film when they shot it and, astoundingly, STILL think its a good film! The screen writer was serious, the director was serious, the cinematographer was serious, and the editor was serious. The editor is even laboring under the delusion that the Harry Potter franchise traces its origins back to Troll 2! Even one of the lead actors, the woman who portrays the Mom, thinks that its a fine film and compares it to Casablanca!

  It is only after you understand that the people who made this train wreck of a film did so as part of an earnest effort to make a good movie that you can really enjoy it in all of its splendid awfulness. And, when you do watch it, do stick with it until the final 20 minutes or so. As bad as the first hour+ is, it isn't until the final reel that this thing really soars into a new realm of almost surreal poopitude.

This masterpiece has absolutely no sense of direction and is an unintelligent mess. The pidgin English that the characters speak is the direct result of the director/screenwriter and his wife's fractured and very rudimentary understanding of the English language. You'll enjoy syntactically broken sentences, delivered with infectiously contradictory vivacious lifelessness, by actors who appear to have no more idea of what the hell is going on in the film than the audience does.

The film crew were also Italians who spoke little-to-no English and, as a result, could not communicate with the cast. This little supposed factoid is COMPLETELY understandable when you watch the movie.

It just makes no sense at all.

Nilbog is Goblin spelled backwards. It's so stupid, yet completely ingenious - a phrase that could be easily used to describe the entire film.

The camera work is phenomenal - every time the camera pans or zooms in, it jumps and bounces, as if someone keeps accidentally knocking it. The acting is brilliant: it makes Jerry Andersen's original wooden Thunderbirds puppets look like Daniel Day-Lewis by comparison. The sets are gorgeous, the hair and makeup are glorious in their full BluRay quality, and the main villain - the Queen of the Goblins... the Queen slips in and out of some sort of East European-Austrian hybrid accent and generic American speech, which is absolutely perfect in its... in its... je ne sais quoi.

Troll 2 is the perfect combination of a horrible script that takes itself too seriously to be taken seriously, the unintentional comedy deriving from the nonsensical plot and broken English, the atrocious acting, the non-existent budget that forces everything to be done creatively and as low-tech as possible, awful stock footage, quintessential 90s clothing and hair, and the fact that you know, deep down, that the ENTIRE special effects budget went toward potted plants, a Styrofoam-built ""magic rock from Stonehenge,"" and the gallons of green goop that characters vomit up throughout the film... I hate to admit it, I really do, but I. LOVED. THIS. FILM.

This low budget direct-to-VHS release - a film that was CLEARLY unsupervised by any studio executive or third-party producers, or it would never have been greenlighted - is an absolute tour de force. It's a triumph by any standard, and it stands tall and proud alongside The Room, Birdemic, ThanksKilling, and The Amazing Bulk as one of the very best of the very worst films ever made.",1363651200,,2567,5.054373522458629

So why a five star rating?  The thing is, the creators of this movie set out to make a legitimate horror film.  They failed.  Miserably.  Words cannot describe just how far away from true horror this movie is.  They indadvertedly made a hilarious comedy.

If you take this move seriously you'll hate it.  If you just poke fun at the logic of it, you'll die of laughter.  Understand, this is an extremely low-budget film.  Most of the film's budget appears to have been spent on green food coloring.  The goblin masks (no there are no trolls in this film) are so low grade that you could get a scarier mask at a Spirit Halloween Store.  The acting...don't get me started on the acting.  I've acted with people in high school in theater productions who are better than the actors in this film!  And the plot makes no sense...whatsoever...

To be fair, I think that the film does have some elements that if developed properly (which of course they aren't) could make a good horror or fantasy film.  This is after all supposed to be a battle of good and evil, humans against ravenous goblins, with magic and ghosts and a young boy struggling to accept the death of his grandfather.  The problem is, these goblins eat human/plant flesh and are scared of straight-up meat and the daughter has a VERY fickle relationship with her boyfriend, who's off galavanting in the woods with his friends as they get picked off one by one by goblins, while the ghost of the deceased grandfather returns to help young Joshua fight off the goblins with a molotof cocktail and a bologna sandwich!

Confused?  Just watch the film and it'll make even less sense but you won't care because you'll be gasping for air out of laughter.

Criticisms aside, this makes for a very entertaining film.  A perfect example of what NOT to do when writing a story, acting or adding special effects in a film.

982990,2,6305074305,"Troll 2... the classic bad movie that has spawned a massive cult following and had it's own documentary made about it. Essentially, the way I would describe this film is a movie that fails in every aspect that makes a movie good but yet, manages to be so enjoyable and very ''watchable'' unlike a load of other ''bad'' movies out there. This movie is very odd, very stupid, and really camp. Now here's something I find interesting. I've always thought that this movie and it's concept would easily been a little acceptable if it were a movie made in the 50's or '60s when those poorly made camp flicks (Creature from the Black Lagoon, Plan 9 from Outer Space) were a dime a dozen.

This movie however, was not made in the 50's or 60's... It was made over the course of three weeks in Summer of 1989 and was released in 1990. But it really does feel like one of those bad movies from the 50's and 60's. It has a horrible script, horrible costumes, horrible acting... I could go on but that would take too long.

There are a number of reasons why this movie is so bad. The main reason why this movie was so bad was because the production crew's inetractions with the actors ended up being a total train wreck. Most of them were native itallians who could speak little to no english. Most of the actors thought they were being cast in this movie as extras. They arrived to the set... and ended up being handed a script. The costume designers made very fake looking costumes for the goblins. It overall had zero production value and this is also evident by how it was filmed in only three weeks. Hey, at least it lasted longer than Kim Kardashian's marriage.

So, you may be asking why this film is called ''Troll 2''. Well, basically in 1986, a movie called ''Troll'' was released. Troll 1 was not a very good film itself either. A few years later when this movie's production was happening, they were originally going to call it ''Goblins!''.  Troll 1 and Goblins were two totally unrelated movies. Well, the stupid marketers decided to ''cash'' in on Troll 1 and rename ''Goblins!'' Troll 2. And alas, the two unrelated films ended up being part of the same series which explains why there are no trolls in this movie, but rather, goblins. Wow. So, anyway let's dive into the review!

Plot: 2 out of 10

So, here's the plot of this movie. There is a family known as the Waits Family. They consist of four members. Joshua, Holly, Michael, and Diana. Joshua and Holly are the two kids and Michael and Diana are the parents. Michael and Diana both want to go on a vacation to a place called Nilbog. They have already worked out a plan to swap houses with one of the residents of the town.

Meanwhile, our protagonist, Joshua (who is clearly off his meds in this scene... and probably off his meds for the entire movie) is being visited by the ghost of his dead grandfather, Grandpa Seth. Seth informs Joshua that in Nilbog, there are goblins. The goblins that reside there can use their magic powers to impersonate humans and hate any sort of meat. Instead they must have plants and vegetables etc. The only way the goblins can get the food they like, though, is by feeding humans some weird green plant-like stuff. When the humans consume it, they turn into green plant-like stuff as well. So, why can't the goblins just eat the original green plant-like stuff? Answers to this... are never going to be explained...

So, the Waits family heads out to Nilbog, and like in any good bad horror film, nobody except for Joshua sees anything ominous at all about the town. Even when the owners of the house they're swaping with stare at them in a creepy way, speak in a low-keyed voice, and leave behind food that has some sort of green slime drizzled over it. Nope, nothing wrong here. Just a couple of jolly, nice, and likeable fellows!

Of course, Joshua, who seems to be the only one who sees any problem with these people (and knows about the goblins) tries to stop his family from eating the food that is infested with green-plant like stuff. Suddenly, good ol' Grandpa Seth arrives. He is somehow able to stop time for thirty seconds, giving Joshua enough time to think of a plan. You want to know what our good friend Joshua does? You really want to know? Joshua pulls down his pants and pees all over their food, being the good hero he is. Of course, this is not the end. Joshua has to help keep his family safe. What should he do? Well, I'm not telling you because that would take too long and because I don't want to spoil this Anti-Masterpiece so there you go.

Okay, while I do admit that the plot is very original, it's original in a terrible way. Seriously, goblins who eat plants that were originally people? A boy who gets help from his dead grandfather on dealing with goblins? REALLY, That's just stupid. Really, really stupid. Of course, it's the sheer stupidity that makes this movie the epic Anti- Masterpiece it is, so I'm not complaining.

Script: 0 out of 10

My god, the script in this movie is bad. It's horrible in every way, but yet so laughable. The lines can just be putrid. Right after the part where I cut off the synopsis, Joshua's dad, Michael screams at him ''You can't p*ss on hospitality!''. A character named Arnold who is introduced later in the film says (very blandly) ''They're eating her... and than they're going to eat me... OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!'' Joshua also gets his fair share of stupidity too. Joshua yells ''Nilbog... is Goblin spelled backwards!"" later in the movie. I'm going to try not to spoil every ridiculous and laughable thing this film has to offer, but I am going to warn you... there's alot.

Acting: 0 out of 10

As supported by everything I wrote above, there really is no acting in this movie. A good 98% of the dialouge is unbelievable and unconvincing. You almost have to see it to believe it. It's tough to accept that a movie that does not have at least one half decent actor in it exists. Well, this film (as well as The Room) is living proof that a movie like that can exsist. As I said though, I can't really show you the acting, but go ahead and type in ''Troll 2 scenes'' in on Youtube. You'll be in for a laugh.

Costumes: 1 out of 10

The costumes in this movie are terrible. Now, don't get me wrong. They would make for an awesome Halloween costume. But, when you're trying to make a movie that's supposed to be scary. I think you should put effort into making costumes where the creatures can TALK. Except for the final scene (And even in the final scene, the lip movement looks horrible) and when they're in their human form (which does not count) these monsters never blink, never open their mouth, never give you the impression that you're looking at an actual creature. It just gives you the feeling that you're looking at some kid asking you ''Trick or Treat''. But hey, it's a terrible camp movie so this only makes it all the more better.

Score: 7 out of 10

 I think this movie actually did have a somewhat good score. It's not phenomanal or anything, but next to every other aspect of this film, it sounds like something John Williams composed. It's pretty atmospheric and does sound a little like something from Castlevania but I would say it is probably the one thing that was done somewhat right in this entire movie.

Closing Comments

Troll 2 is something I would reccomend to only certain people. To anyone who loves ''So Bad, It's Good'' movies, this should be at the top of your wishlist. If you don't like watching bad movies in general, including ''So Bad, It's Good'' I say you back off from this one.

982992,5,6305074305,"I love bad movies and have been a fan of them for many years. To this day I try to keep up with what is currently considered the apex of anti-style. I just can't understand the recent elevation of ""The Room"" to a bad-movie status virtually equal to Troll 2.

Troll 2 is the funniest and greatest bad movie ever made. The costumes, performances, script and special effects are consistently hilarious. The Room, on the other hand, has a few things that induce a smile but it is only marginally worse or funnier than a hundred other small budget vanity projects just like it. There are no cheesy costumes or special effects or musical numbers to laugh at. It is really just an empty display of amateurism, more a sad waste of time and money than it is funny.

To me, a movie has to have some sort of budget and an attempt at professionalism to be truly, transcendently bad. It has to try and gloriously fail at everything. Vanity projects like The Room fail in a way that is boring because they are too self absorbed; professional or semi-professional projects like Troll 2 or Battlefield Earth or Can't Stop the Music or even Gigli fail in a funny way because they are trying hard to entertain us, they are just too incompetent to do so.

Give me the crazy costumes, the outrageous special effects, the nonsensical plots, the big stars making fools of themselves, the mad scientist directors and the failed attempts at humor over the self-glorifying soft-porn antics of the clueless rich-guy Tommy Wiseau types of the world any day.

982995,5,6305074305,"I was trying to think of a way to start or even write a mini-review for this film, I'm not quite sure if I can pull it off but here it goes.

I had a memory of seeing this movie as a child but had never remembered the name or thought much of it then, but now it has amassed a legion of fans who get together just to have Troll 2 parties, or make costumes replicating the ones from the film. That statement alone should tell you how excellent of a film this is. Excellent meaning so bad that it's good.

The director of the film doesn't speak anything but a broken English, his name is Claudio Fragasso. He said (in the best worst movie documentary) that he was able to lead his cast through emotions and hand gestures primarily, and it shows. The acting is wooden and sometimes has dialogue that doesn't make much sense, so much so that it becomes hysterical to watch, and is an adventure and experience most people should have at least once.

The story primarily involves the main child (Joshua) speaking to his dead grandfather about goblins who trick people into eating various green foods, which then transform the people into a bunch of green vegetable mush that the goblins then devour. Keep in mind the movie is called Troll 2 but the word troll is never uttered even once during the film, and there are no trolls in the film, just goblins. Also, it's a sequel that has nothing to do with the original Troll film, nor does it have anything at all to do with the third film which is called Troll 3 (also known as Creepers, Contamination .7, Troll III: Contamination Point 7, or The Crawlers)

The family in the story ends up house swapping with a country bumpkin-esqe  family from a near by town known as Nilbog. You will experience green food, small people in goblin outfits/masks, horrible lines of dialogue with atrocious delivery, peeing on said green food, corn popping in thin air during a not so steamy make-out scene, and even a man who during a mental institution stay, actually landed a role in this film as the shop keep.

This movie has gotten a very big resurgence as of late, my friend even made me a Troll 2 cake for my birthday along with green milk, green plates, and green donuts. It is highly recommended that after seeing this movie you watch The Best Worst Movie Ever Documentary, which explains all the ins and outs of the Troll 2 universe, and where the actors are now. Most of them get a kick out of being in such a horrible movie and don't take themselves too seriously. All the while the director tends to lash out at people making fun of his film, or him believing the actors were making up stories to demean his directing abilities.

To explain this movie doesn't do much justice, it just sounds like a terrible film, which it is. But if you can laugh at things and not take it too seriously, it becomes an excellent film for a movie night with friends. Horror movie fans, comedy movie fans, and niche movie fans will all enjoy this gem for what it is. A diamond in the rough. LOL

983079,4,6305074305,"Recently, Troll 2 has gained a high level of cult status amongst movie buffs, making it a kind of modern Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Whether it's from the clip on Youtube or not I'm not sure(but I'm sure it's documented now).  It even got mention in a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly!  Hell, it's even now got an ""Anniversary Edition"" DVD!!  The original Sonny Bono classic, Troll, didn't even get this kind of recognition.
I saw this movie when I was about 13 or so, and thought it was goofy fun, but pretty much shelved it back in my memory since then.  With the recent interest I watched it again, and it's easy to see why it has the reputation it has.  It's a movie that benefits from all of it's shortcomings, cheapness, and downright silliness.  If this movie had been done ""better"", as in better directing, acting, etc., it wouldn't have the entertainment value it has.  Sometimes doing the a film ""wrong"", so to speak, actually is the right way to go.
As you may already know, Troll 2 is about a family that takes a vacation to a small town called Nilbog, and ends up fighting for their lives against the town of goblins who want to turn them into plants and eat them.  You see, goblins are hardcore vegetarians, so hardcore in fact that red meat plays a large part in their downfall.  I won't go into much plot other than that coz many folks have already summed that up rather well(and humorously).
But everything you've heard is true.  It's so schlocky and off the wall that it almost defies description.  I'm not even sure that you could say that the acting is bad because it's so over the top, obviously on purpose, that in a way the acting is probably right on the money, if you catch my drift.  Then there's the obvious mystery with the film's title.  Not a sequel and no trolls.  But this is an Italian production, and fans of Italian films know that they are notorious for making ""sequels"" to successful(and even not so successful) films.  Fulci's Zombie was slapped with a ""2"" to pass it off as a sequel to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and look at how many ""Django"" movies there are, even though there were only officially two of them.  I'm sure in other countries Troll 2 is probably called ""Goblin Town"" or ""Nilbog"" or something to that degree, but in America it's Troll 2, which in itself is odd coz Troll wasn't a supersmash or anything(I like it though).
Troll 2 was directed by twelve time oscar winner Claudio Fragasso, who's blessed us with smash hits like Zombie 4(not it's real title either), and the Alice Cooper extravaganza, Monster Dog.  It was produced by Joe D'Amato, a name any fan of Italian horror will be very familiar with.
For it's PG-13 rating, this movie has a decent amount of gooeyness.  No real blood or gore, but a lot of oozing green vegetable blood and human/plant hybrids that are kinda disturbing in a way.
So for all of it's oddities, Troll 2 certainly does deserve a kind of cult status(though I'm not sure why it took so long), but if you dig deeper into the Italian film archives(or even American for that matter), you'll find that many such oddball gems exist and await to be discovered.",1301702400,2,3142,4.490333919156415

983081,4,6305074305,now before i begin my view on the movie i want to clarify that i have the double feature dvd of troll and troll 2. not the 20 aniversary nilbog edition. but that double feature was cheaper and this has the same features as that one. which is the trailer. now about the movie. this is quite a bad movie. a family from the city trades houses with a family from nilbog. they all seem happy about this except for there son who has been recving warning from his dead grandfather about not going there because it is a town full of goblins(not trolls) which eat humans!  in fact the movie was originally called goblins but was named troll 2 because i guess they thought the first film was succesful enough for a sequal despite no conection to that movie. well the movie is bad. very bad. but it has a certain charm that is undeniable. and some of the lines like everyone favorite oh my goddddd! and the you cant piss on hospitality i won't allow it are classic and i have seem much worse movies. you can see they were trying to make a good film. they just had a very low budget and bad actors who never did much after this.because whlie it had a bad script a good actor can make a script not seem quite as bad but there acting just made this film worse but it did add to it funny camp value. so if you dare watch it with a open mind because if you take this movie seriously you will hate it. but if you look at it has a comedy you might like it.,1300752000,,1438,4.081272084805653
983082,5,6305074305,"A few friends of mine contacted me sometime last year, raving about this flick. They spoke for hours on end about how this film had the worst acting, effects, plot, etc., that they had ever seen. They began to quote the movie and ramble endlessly about the different shortcomings in the movie. After a while, I decided to check it out for myself, just to see how badly they were exaggerating.

It turns out, they were selling it short.

There is no possible way that ANYONE would ever be convinced that this is a good movie. The acting borders on the unbearable (especially the kid, who looks like he may have hemorrhoids, and the mom, who reacts to every little thing as if Charlie Sheen were killing someone right in front of her), the plot is impossible to believe (a family needs a vacation, so they do the logical thing: they trade houses with a family of complete strangers), and the special effects could not have been worse if a class of kindergarteners had done them (burlap sacks, crappy masks, and green...stuff).

If this all sounds negative, however, let me reassure you; I enjoyed every minute of the film. The film appears to try really hard to be 'scary,' so much so that it ends up being one of the funniest films of all time. There is a slew of impossibly brilliant lines (*as Goblins eat his mom* ""They're eating my mom!"") and the whole film just feels like something the Monty Python guys would come up with. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes bad movies, or anyone at all who isn't really uptight about their movie experiences.

Oh, and by the way, the town in the film is called Nilbog (""Goblin"" spelled backwards). If that doesn't get you rushing over to your nearest video store, I don't know what will!",1299888000,3,1741,4.535031847133758

One night the spirit of his grandpa Seth (Robert Ornsby) tells him a story of a Peter Pan like fellow who is chased by Goblins until he turns into a plant-like being that Goblins eat as they are vegetarian creatures. The family head out to a town called Nilbog where the folks are very weird and all that but something doesn't seem quite right for the town is ran by an evil witch and the folks are goblins in disguise as they trap tourists to turn them into dinner but can Joshua and his grandpa's spirit fight the menace?

One of those guilty pleasures you can't help but liked! in 1990 three Italian movie makers were making a low budget horror movie called ""Goblin"" then re-titled to ""Troll 2"" to think it would be a sequel to 1986's Empire Pictures production was filmed in Utah and released on video in late 1991 to major negativity from everyone and the cast members were ashamed they made this movie. The guy who played the father is now a dentist in Alabama but feels like a cult hero because of his famous quote that is seen on T-shirts and been shown on HBO back in 93. I saw this so bad it's good film when i was 12 about 18 years ago on HBO and thought it was a funny as hell even with the ""Oh MY GODDDDDDDDD"" line and those trolls look ridiculous with faces that look like halloween masks with pillows stuffed in their shirts. If you like Mystery Science Theater 3000 then give this hoot a try at home.

This DVD/Blu-Ray has ok picture and alright sound but the only extra is the trailer. I also recommend getting the brilliant documentary ""Best Worst Movie Ever"" to see why this movie is a cult classic now.",1299542400,4,1817,4.388724035608309

983139,1,6305074305,"Troll 2, despite the name, is not a sequel to the first Troll film.

Troll had a certain charm and some name actors and a fantasy story about magical creatures in the present time.  The models and dolls were interesting and clearly showed some skill.

Troll 2 didn't have any of that!

The film started out fairly well, but went downhill from the first 10 minutes.

A family moves into a farm house, switching with another family from that farm house to live in the city.  The name of the farm town is Nilgob.  ""Nilgob"" is Goblin spelled backwards.  No one in the film figures that one out until well into the film!

The acting is very wooden.  The mom and her bug-eyed stare and weird lines is just ridiculous.

The guy who plays the grandfather ghost is pretty interesting.  They did not play up much on what he could do with his powers against the forces of evil.

The costumes and masks were so fake!  I thought I was looking at a high school Halloween drama rather than a major motion picture.

There was the subplot of this guy who preferred to bring his guy friends along rather than love his girlfriend.  He preferred his boys hanging around.  This was pretty crazy.  Why would someone do that?  And then when the boys are being taken over or killed one by one, their friends in the mobile truck are kicking back and watching TV.  Pretty lame.

The weird Stonehenge angle had the goblins get their power from a stone.  So when the stone is neutralized, the goblins are still around anyway.  In a different town!

This film has no redeeming value.  Not recommended!",1295740800,2,1572,4.469964664310954

Anytime we have the chance to see a new piece of 90's B cinema we jump all over it like an elf fresh out of a life size stocking. Being released in 1990, Troll 2 kicked of the decade in absolute perfect fashion being easily one of the top ten worst films we have ever seen. Now when we say ""worst"" let it be understood that it really means fantastic as far as B horror goes. For any conventional movie watcher this one will fly right over their heads.

Troll 2 wastes no time in sucking you in with it's horrid acting and weirdo family as they get ready to take a family vacation. However this families vacation consists of switching homes with people they've never met leaving them stranded in a cult like town. The main actor is a young kid named Joshua that has chats with his dead grandpa who warns him of the trolls that inhabit this place they're going to. Once there everything unravels and the townspeople are exposed as plant eating Trolls that disguise themselves as humans. Yeah it's even worse then it sounds!

This movie is hands down one of the greatest B horror you will find out there. It has every single B factor from laughable acting, horrible effects, awful plot, with so much more leaving your jaw lying on the floor in amazement. If you were on something watching this you'd transport yourself to another dimension of B that you may never recover from. It was also nice to show some support to other midget actors out there...which was plentiful here.

From the atrocious script to the awful acting to the random directorial close-ups, Troll 2 fails in every artistic manner possible.  It is not just kinda bad, or bad in parts, or misunderstood; it is literally a 90 minute train wreck that only gets worse and worse as it goes along.  Luckily, that is exactly what makes it a cult classic.  Cram packed with memorably dreadful dialogue and laugh out loud characters, you can't help but enjoy yourself through the whole thing.  Alone or especially with a group of friends, Troll 2 is a hold-your-sides, pee your pants, tears streaming down your face, relentless laugh riot that takes itself just seriously enough that you know it wasn't bad on purpose.  I can honestly say, this is the best worst movie ever.

**ABOUT THE BLU RAY**  It annoys me when people say, ""If it's so bad why would you want to see it in 1080p?""  Well, why Wouldn't you?  Poor picture quality does not make a movie bad, it just makes it have poor picture quality.  Fortunately for high def lovers like myself, the blu ray transfer is AWESOME!!  Remarkably vivid and even gorgeous at times during nature scenes, this was an HD release that must have been taken at least somewhat seriously.  Compared to the DVD, it blows it out of the water.  Absolutely stunning.

As far as EXTRAS though, there aren't any. The only extra included is the Theatrical Trailer in HD, and it's hardly anything special.  If you are interested in more info about the movie however, there is the great documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-Worst-Movie/dp/B003X3BYHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best Worst Movie</a>&nbsp;coming out to DVD in November that focuses on Troll 2's cult following and interviews some of the cast.

Overall, I think Troll 2 is a rare gem that shouldn't be missed.  Here's a brief summary:

- Yes, it's really that bad - but hilarious because of it
- Perfect to watch in groups
- No, you don't have to see Troll 1 first.  They just used the Troll name to capitalize on the first film's minor success
- Blu Ray transfer is excellent

983147,3,6305074305,"""Troll 2"" should have been doomed to obscurity, much like the first unrelated-but-actually-fits-the-title movie.  But because of that one short scene with the nerd, his three lines of corny dialogue and a fly on his head, the movie had its internet 15 minutes of fame.  There was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/even-a-documentary/dp/B003X3BYHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">even a documentary</a>&nbsp;about its cult acclimation, and I would certain give my time and day to view that film.  The most interesting aspect the whole nerd character, who's name is Arnold BTW, is the fact he's only a bit character (but don't worry, he has plenty of corny moments besides that iconic scene).

The real stars of the film are Joshua and his family. To be frank, I hated that little brat, Joshua. He whines all the time, and always has that whiny expression, even when nothing horrible was going on; imagine all of his lines being read in Eric Cartman's ""But Mmmmaaah!"" vernacular and you'll understand how annoying he is. Conversely, his bodybuilding sister always smiles even when she's suppose to be angry, which is weirdly amusing when she's fights against her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend, by the way, was just there; doesn't play the hero when trouble's afoot, he's just excess baggage. The mother has the creepiest dead eyes since Mia Kirshner, and her line delivery's just as dead. The father...well, he's a pansy.  Finally, there's Grandpa, who was dead but became a spirit who can only talk with Joshua about great danger as his family goes on a vacation to Nilbog (clever).

Grandpa's entire existence pretty much destroys the whole plot. Initially, it's established he could only communicate to Joshua to warn him about danger, and what the kid should do to prevent it.  But at one point, Ghost Grandpa accidentally communicated with Joshua's sister, which showed that he can speak to just about anyone. So why couldn't he just pop up and warn his entire family not to go to Nilbog?  His shocking appearance would have even the most scornful of his kins to believe him.  He could show proof of his trust by showing his ability to FREEZE TIME as a convenience.  Why bother having the kid take on such a heavy duty?  Josh's actions are usually done in stupid ways: for example, when Grandpa froze his family from eating the tainted foods so Joshy can have the time to find a solution, instead of taking the food from them and throwing them in the trash, he urinates the food.  Not a bright move, kid.  If Grandpa would had warned his family directly in the first place, they wouldn't go on that trip and one of them wouldn't turn into vegetable munchies in the end.

And now for the bad guys.  The family is dealing with little people wearing rubbing masks and potato sacks (pretending to be goblins), and the main villain is a plant witch named Creedence, who's even hammier than Poison Ivy from ""Batman & Robin"".  And let's not forget the fact that they can be defeated by eating a ham sandwich.  Gee, aren't they a scary bunch.

The story really got stupider and sloppier as it went on, right when the family went into Nilbog and met the civvies of the town who plan to eat them in veggie form.  When Joshua went in a hidden meeting (out of the blue) and spotted the human-disguised goblins, he left his skateboard JUST near an open ramp in the attic so it can slide down and the noise would discover him. It had an arbitrary scene when Creedence donned a cheap Elvira outfit and seduced one of the boyfriend's best friends (they were also in Nilbog) with an ear of corn. She didn't really kill him, just covered him in popcorn, and she just left him to be written out of the film; not even the family acknowledged him when they escaped.  That poor excuse for softcore porn was a completely pointless moment, even with Creedence's nice figure.  Goblins surrounding the family but just stood there as they walk away, the family running into the house but not into the car to drive away from the monsters, there's more of those dumb moments to throw around.

No doubt ""Troll 2"" is a terrible movie, but I thought it's terrible in a gleeful way.

983262,4,6305074305,"Troll 2 is classicaly horrendous. It almost felt like a bunch of semi-musically talented high school students on a 20-hour work week Mcdonald's budget got together and decided to make a horror movie.
The make up and props are so horrendous they probably bought them all discouted at Party City (when the goblins are eating people they never actually eat but just rub the gunk over their mouths), the editing is so inequivicobly atrocious that no more than one scene is flashed at a time (whenever something supernatural happens the same EXACT lightening effect is used over and over), the acting is so pathetic it feels like you're watching a high school production, and you'll get a good laugh every time.
The movie is basically about a family of morons who decide to do a house switch with a wierdo goblin family (disguised as human) in a desersted rural town of Nilbog (Goblin spelled backwards). There is only one woman in Nilbog and she undoubtably steals the show. This goblin witch-mother, Credence Lenoir, is so hysterical with all her exaggerated overly OVERLY dramatic headspins and wide-eyes that you'll want to watch the film over and over again just to laugh at her, yet you'll love her at the same time. Only she successfully walks the line between serious and tongue-in-cheek humorous essence that, like I said, you'll definitely want to share this one with your movie-buff friends.
It reminds me of an old Peter Jackson horror flick, yet way funnier because it seriously attempts to try and be good.
If there's one thing I truly did think was ACTUALLY good about this film was the soundtrack. Though the same 3 tracks were used to try and portray terror, they were actually really well written and without them, the classic feel of this flick would've never been achieved.

Definitely check this movie out, a must for movie/horror buffs.",1200700800,,1853,4.8454258675078865
983263,1,6305074305,"Every so often, something in my life occurs that so moves me that I have no other choice than to share it with those around me - good, bad or worse.  In this instance,  I am speaking of course about the crusty cinematic turd known as ""Troll 2.""

Now, I am actually a fan of bad movies.  I like them.  For me, there is a certain kind of charm in movies where you can see the boom mike, or where there are more plot-holes than a barrel of Swiss cheese.  But every now and then, there comes along something that is so grievous, so utterly unwatchable that it causes me intense emotional distress and sometimes actual physical pain and/or uncontrollable vomiting.  Such is the case with Troll 2.  I went into this half expecting something related to the first movie, ""Troll"" which is actually watchable.  Not so.  First, Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls.  Not only are there no trolls in this film, but no one even mentions the word ""troll"" at all.  Instead, we see glances of the film's protagonists, a lot of dwarves with badly formed latex masks (called ""goblins"" in the ""film"") and a hideous, frightening terrible out-of-work community theater refugee that's supposed to be their mother of sorts.  I say hideous, because at one point she takes off her ""witch"" makeup and transforms into what is supposed to be an alluring vixen in an attempt to seduce an underage teenager - that's when the term hideous applies.  The special effects, if they can be called that, are cast-offs from garage projects of local sci-fi fans and junior high school prop rooms.  The acting is, across the board, the worst I have ever suffered through.  It's obvious no one knew their lines, and were just a step away from reading cue cards.  In fact, there were a few instances where they did just this.  Words like ""stilted"" and ""wooden"" and ""amateurish"" would be kind descriptions indeed.

But I've teased you long enough.  You want to know what the plot was, right?  Well, dammit!  So do I!  There wasn't one.  The closest I could ascertain was this:  A kid starts having hallucinations about his dead grandfather, who comes to his bedroom each night to read him gory tales of medieval people whose scalps explode when nasty goblins (who actually disguise themselves as beautiful women with painted-on freckles) trick them into eating tainted ice cream, which turns them into plants.  So the goblins can eat them - the people.  Because they (the goblins) are vegetarians.  Anyway, the boy's parents plan a sort of ""Trading Spouses"" trip to a small town called Nilbog (goblin spelled backwards - point beaten about our face and neck several times throughout the film)  Upon reaching said Nilbog, the boy discovers that the town is really the kingdom of the goblins in human guise.  In the meantime, his older sister who is dying to lose her virginity has manipulated her boyfriend to follow them to the town in a Winnebago.  Then it gets confusing.  One of boys meets a hot chick running through the woods, being chased by goblins.  They run to a church inhabited by a witch.  Witch turns girl and boy into plants - goblins eat girl - save boy for later.  His pals never miss him.  At this point, we are introduced to some side plot involving spoiled milk that I never understood.  Another teen runs to the grocery store - all they have is spoiled milk for sale.  He gets some, and stumbles upon the church - sees his friend standing in a flowerpot.  Witch returns, kills flower pot boy with a chainsaw and kills spoiled milk boy as well.

Meanwhile, the family has run out of food - they go into town to buy groceries and get the same spoiled milk shtick.  Upon returning home, all of the goblin people have showed up and they have a hoedown with lots of food.  In the meantime, the young boy who sees his dead grandfather is captured and the attempt to force feed him the goblin ice cream, but he's save in the nick of time.  Back at the house, the boy friend and the rest of the family enjoy the musical stylings of the goblin-people square dance quartet while the dead grandpa breaks out of a mirror and scares the whore-sister.  They have a long fight with the goblin people.  The witch returns to the last teen watching a movie in the Winnebago.  Oh, how I longed to be watching whatever that was on the TV in the camper, which happened to be a movie about a chimp in a tutu that could fly with sparks flying out of the tutu.  Anyway, the witch comes, now as what we are supposed to interpret as a sexy seductress. brandishing an ear of corn that she intends to use to entice her last young victim.  To do what, we can only guess.  They make out and the ear of corn turns to popcorn, engulfing the lad and frightening away the witch. Got is so far?

In the epic final battle, the goblins and witch are defeated when dead grandpa and the rest of the family put their hands on the rocks of Stonehenge, which happens to be in the witch's house.  All is well.  Not quite.  The goblins show up again at their real home, change the mother into plant matter, eat her and offer some to the boy.  Neat huh?  No!  It's an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.  I could have been unclogging the toilet or cleaning the gutters or some other interesting chore.

983265,5,6305074305,"Let me start by saying, there is absolutely, positively NO good reason to see this movie!!  With that said, you really do need to see this movie.

Confused?  Good, then you are ready to watch this film.  The acting is awful.  The costumes came straight from a feed barn and K-Mart.  The effects can be found in any quarter-taking, green slime-dispensing gumball machine.  And the plot is non-existant.  You will sit through this film torn between - scratching your head in confusion, laughing at the absurdity of it all, and wanting to claw your own eyes out of your head.

However, if you are in the mood for one of those movies that has nothing whatsoever to do with the title it carries, then boooooy, are you in luck!  There are no trolls in this film at all ... I mean none!  So all you troll's rights activists can rest easy, watch away!  (All you goblin fans however, prepare to heave your guts out at the horrible portrayal of your beloved little imps.)  The film basically revolves around a young boy, his braindead family, his sister's heterosexually dead boyfriend, and his actually dead (but persistantly present) grandpa.  They play ""trading houses"" with complete strangers who just happen to be goblins in disguise, who just happen live in a goblin-infested town called (wait for it .....) NILBOG!  Yeah ... I know, it's not all that challenging for you ""New York Times"" crossword solving types ... it's ""GOBLIN"" spelled backwards.  GENIUS!!  If you didn't figure that out immediately, don't feel to bad, the characters in the movie won't figure it out until 3/4 of the movie has past (and your medication will probably kick in very shortly).

But hey, what's to worry?  The Goblins are vegetarians!  Oh ... wait, they all want to turn you into plants first, and theeeen eat you.  Of course!  Why didn't I think of that sooner?!  Worry not though, intrepid watchers of this piece of Oscar caliber cinematic gold, one good Mickey D's cheeseburger will solve everything!  (Well ... that, and a molitav cocktail, lovingly supplied to a young boy by his ""dead only when it's convenient"" grandpa.)

In short, this is one for the ages!  If you are a fan of Spielberg, Lucas, or Capolla, skip this at all costs!  If, however you are a great fan of B movies ... skip this at all costs!

983268,1,6305074305,"I've studied this film over the last couple of months and this is my analysis of Troll 2. I would like to begin my review by saying that watching this movie will be like taking a hot fork and shoving it in your eye socket for some people, whereas for others it will be the funniest F'n thing you've ever seen.

Before I get into the meat of the story or as I like to call it a double decker bologna sandwich...Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls (just goblins), Troll 2 also has absolutely nothing to do with Troll 1. AHA but that's not all!!!! The guy who made the cover for Troll 2 didn't see Troll 1 or Troll 2!!!! The original cover of Troll 2 has a werewolf (Not in Troll 1 or Troll 2) chasing a little boy who doesn't even appear in either of the Troll movies! If that doesn't make you want to take your head and smash it against concrete, I don't know what does.

I will now begin with the double decker bologna sandwich part of my analysis. The film begins with Grandpa Seth talking to his grandson Joshua. Joshua is constipated throughout the film and grandpa is dead. You know the kind of dead where you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you give your 12 year old grandson a Molotov cocktail and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back...that kind of dead. He tells that old story of how Peter Pan ran through the woods one day, ate green goup, and turned into a MLANT. The mother, played by Margo Prey (AKA greatest actress ever) assures Joshua that it was just a dream and goes onto explain that Grandpa's death was, ""Very difficult for your father, for Holly, and for me his daughter."" You may want to give that quote a second reading... The daughter is also brilliant in this picture. The chemistry between her and her boyfriend Elliott is sizzling!!! Ouch very hot! So sizzling that Elliott and his friends couldn't be more gay! Holly explains, ""You take them to bed with you too (referring to Elliott's guy friends that are hanging out the window) and I don't believe in group sex"". What??? Holly then explains that her parents don't like Elliott (that he is a good for nothing) and that they are going on vacation for a month. Ellliott then asks, ""Is it true you're going on vacation tomorrow?"" ""Yes!"" ""I'll come with you?"" ""OK I'll tell my father that you're coming with us tomorrow"" Believe me the movie keeps going...Joshua must do it he must do it! He must pee on everyone's food before they eat corn with green paste on it. Oh my god! Or how about ""You're a genius big Sister!"" Watch for the mother staring directly into the camera and yelling, ""Oh dear god what can we do!"" So they have this family exchange and they go to Nilbog and oh my god!

This movie is a pure masterpiece. It's so bad it's fantastic! I recommend everyone to give it one viewing just so you can say you've survived it's stupidity. Make sure you watch it with friends though...DO NOT watch this movie alone or you will try to figure it out. This movie cannot be understood! If you think this movie is good in the way that ""Braveheart"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" is good you should seriously get your head examined. I will leave you with this: Mother says ""Elliott what are you doing here?"" Daughter says ""Elliott is part of the family now!"" Mom puts her hand on Elliott's face, ""Oh Elliott!""",1125273600,114,3392,4.32182103610675

The acting is dreadful but the actors are so convincing--they could not possibly have known how bad they were.  We're often torn between thinking the movie was a serious attempt at a horror film and thinking it was deliberate.  But I think it was unintentionally dreadful.  Believe me, you will not be wasting your time watching this movie.  The lines are great and memorable as are such images as a youthful version of the witch making out with one of the boys and an ear of corn with popcorn randomly filling the camper.  The music is priceless.  The townspeople (really goblins) clapping to a repetative and annoying tune while surrounding the seated family expecting them to eat the suspicious-looking food is memorable, as are the scenes with the sister dancing in front of the mirror or lifting weights, and the mother insisting, ""sing that song I like--sing my favorite song Joshua,"" at which Joshua breaks into ""row, row, row your boat...""

Ohh yeah and the kid on the box is not the same kid in the movie. My only guess as to how the movie got the name trolls is that real goblins were upset that they were portrayed in such a bad movie and sued.
Right, onto the plot.... Evil vegitarian ""GOBLINS"" have taken over the town of NILBOG (which is goblin spelled backwards cause the writer was just so damn creative...) Any how, these goblins like to eat people, but there is a catch, they need to turn them into plants first. Then there is this dead old guy who reads little johnny stories about goblins even though they have never encounterd goblins before and live in suburbia. Anyhow they trade their house with some hick family from the wonderfull little retreat of nilbog. They then go to nilbog where the family sytematically attempts to devour any type of putrid green food they can get their hands on, so little johnny is forced to pee on all the food in their house to make the moldy food somehow less appitizing. To make the plot even better Johnny's sister is being followed by her lover who has 3 male friends that he apparently takes with him. He convinces his friends to go with him to Nilbog by telling them that there are ""hot girls"". oddly enough one of the boys manages to find a hot girl running from goblins in the woods. they are then trapped in some old ladys house that looks like a church and the hot girl is turned into green slime and gobbled up while the boy is turned into a tree. Then some stupid stuff happens for a while and we come to the end of our movie. Little Johnny and his family are trapped in a house surrouded by goblns. Then Grandpa comes to save they day with his molatov coctail. but he gets beat up but its ok because he is realy just God and zaps the goblins with lightning.

983429,5,6305074305,"Since the 1950s the US government has covered up the truth about a little town called Nilbog. Gene Freak was a young up and coming scientist with a covert government operation that cross-breeds plans and humans to ""further medical advances."" Somehow Gene got involved in the occult and that is where the horror started. A superior race of burlap wearing goblins was created instead. For decades the Nilbog family exchange program brought families from the country to the quiet town of Nilbog for a little ""relaxation."" None of those families were heard from again. Many concluded that the peaceful existence of Nilbog enticed families to stay there, however a few thought it was actually much more depraved than that. There were always whispers that these families became food. Fast forward to 1990. Grandpa Seth, although dead, was one of those truth-seekers who wanted to expose Nilbog for what it is. His desire to get the truth about Nilbog, to the citizens of the world, was so strong that he was able to come back from the dead to warn his grandson, Joshua. Joshua learns the truth and must spread the word to save his family. When his family arrives at The Presents house(the family they exchanged with) there are delicious food items left out, but there is something very sinister about the food. It is green, which usually means it is quite healthy, but in this case if you eat it, you turn into a plant, and the goblins then eat you. Joshua's sister and mother(played by Sissy Spacek I think) don't believe Joshua's tales about the goblins or the food, so(after an apparition of Grandpa Seth giving advice and stopping time)Joshua does what so many of us have done at a family gathering: he urinates on the food. For this he is admonished by his dad(a strong performance by Craig T Nelson of ""Coach"" fame) who says, ""You can't ... on hospitality. I won't allow it."" Meanwhile, his sister's boyfriend and his very close friends are in town looking to score with some Nilbog hotties, are oblivious to what evil fate awaits them. Sheriff Gene Freak offers one of them a delicious green glass of milk and another is seduced by a corn on the cob wearing beauty. Unfortunately, like many visitors to Nilbog they ""bite off more than they can chew."" This movie is so shocking, so real and so courageous that it is a must see. The special-effects(especially the lightning) make ""Jurassic Park"" look like ""Land of The Lost."" The performances are delicious: Gene Freak and the Drugstore Owner were both nominated for Best Actor at the Academy awards. The preacher won best supporting actor in a movie about Goblins. Unfortunately, the US government does not want the truth about Sheriff Gene Freak, nor Nilbog, to be exposed. This is the reason it took me 8 phone calls to 8 different video stores to finally track this movie down. Has anyone else found it curious that these ""actors"" were never seen from again? Many think these were not actors at all, and this is just a documentary. I called amnesty international and they ""claim"" to know nothing about Nilbog, even when I informed them that it's Goblin speeled backwards. I think it is all one big cover-up.

Troll 2 is one of these movies, and the effect it has had on my life is so  profound that it is difficult to put into words. Without revealing too much  of the movie, let me just state that Troll 2's plot was a stroke of genius,  and offers something for every type of movie-goer.  Horror fans will  rejoice with delight when they first witness Nilbog's resident goblins,  which are a tour de force of special effects coupled with extremely  realistic-looking makeup and potato sacks.

On top of all this, the storyline and accompanying musical score  will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Will the unfortunate protagonists  devour the toxic substances labeled by the Nilbog townsfolk as  ""food,"" or will Joshua and his family be forced to endure a bout  of the dreaded ""hunger pains?""  Can an ear of corn possibly be  used as a seductive tool?  Is everyone in Nilbog actually a goblin in  disguise, or are they just misguided souls held captive under the  authoritarian dictatorship of Sheriff Gene Freak?  Finally, what ghostly  entity repeatedly buttons and unbuttons the father's shirt, and is this  scene used to foreshadow the appearance of the deceased Grandpa Seth?  Many  more questions will arise during your first viewing of Troll 2, and you  will probably have to watch it multiple times before the whole plot starts  to fit together.

Are these images from an as of  yet unreleased TROLL III?  Why, do you ask? Because that kid, doll, or even  the giant troll with an axe are not anywhere in the movie!  How great is  that.  Top off the worst film of all time with the funniest sex scene ever  with a Tom ""THE Man"" Jones soundtrack and you have a movie worth  killing a small town for. This movie has enspired my friends and I to film  our own TROLL III.  We already have the first few scenes done and it'll be  distributed as soon as the prints are dry!",951696000,9,1009,4.092783505154639

""We will have to soak the meat in  vineger all night just to get the blood out"" This movie features the  greatest music video of ""you can leave your hat on"" where a Witch  with some sort of speech problem (unless that acting) and one of  ""Eliot's Boys"" eat corn on the cobb while watching some movie  about monkeys with jets on their feet... it gets a little fuzzy here  because I can't say for sure if I have ever maintained consciousness  throughout the scene but somehow they end up filling the trailer they are  in with popcorn.

983532,5,6305074305,"I first saw this movie on HBO and couldn't stand it.  Then, the more I watched it, the more I had to have.  This movie is the worst scripted, worst acted piece of S*** to ever be put on the cheap imitation of  celluloid film reel.  It su**s, but let's get into why you should at least  watch it once.  Here is the basic story of the film if you could call it  one:  A young goofy freckled kid named Joshua, who suffers from seeing his  dead Grandpa Seth, who in-turn is always talking about goblins like he is  an expert or something, begins to fear what his grandpa is talking about.  Then, his family takes a vacation to a small town known as NILBOG out in  the middle of podunk nowhere and Joshua finds out that there is a whole  slew of about 23 people and their dumb queen (who I have no clue in their  right mind would hire as even a stagehand) who are goblins.  Here is a list  of the cr** in this film:
1.)  The movie is called TROLL, not GOBLIN 2.)  The acting is pitiful and not just by the main characters, such as the  nilbog general store clerk or sheriff Gene Freak 3.)  At one point in the  movie, Joshuas family speak about how the people in town must go to sleep  ""this early at night"", yet it is high noon. 4.)  Pathetic  costumes where you can see the midgets through the eyeholes.  (Also, if  someone is going to do a scene in which you see trolls or goblins, at least  HAVE ENOUGH costumes for the actors rather than show a few humans along  with them. 5.)  Just about everything else in the movie.
Trust me, this  movie is cra**, so why are you asking did I give it 5 stars???  It's so bad  it grows on you and it is worth watching over and over just to look at the  flaws, laugh at the incredibly bad filmmaking, and overall just to see one  of those annoying goblins!",933897600,6,1791,4.095652173913043

7884484,3,6305074305,"Troll 2's hype is right, it is the best worst movie you'll ever see.  The acting is indeed absolutely terrible, the goblins like people wearing loosely fitted plastic masks, you can even see the human actor's face through the mouth of a mask as one stage. The writing is really bad.  But because it's so bad, it's actually quite fun viewing.  This is like Sharknado but made about 13 years before.  If the Internet had been used by the masses back in 1990, this thing would likely have gone viral along the same path.  This film was even a little ahead of it's time, today heaps of people swap houses using various websites to live in, not sure how the family actually arranged it in this one, but that's what they do, they go from the city to a small rural house near the town of Nilbog, the kid will point out the significance of that in the film.

The writing is so bad you wonder why it's called Troll 2, when there are no trolls, just goblins in it.  It is one star in quality, but because your so glued to the screen with it's terribleness, just waiting to see what it will do next to make it even worse, you've got give it three stars for entertaining you for an hour and a half.  There's plenty of bad movies, that bore you to tears, Troll 2 isn't one of those, so you should check it out!",1522540800,,1297,4.201612903225806

And I loved that part, we're just going to switch houses with a family from the country for a month. Maybe one good thing did come out of it, I think I found next year's halloween costume, although I think I'll leave the green slurry on the sideline.

7884488,5,6305074305,"If this film was distributed during the Nazi-era, it could have been a morale tool and one of the better propaganda films promoting an anti-communist agenda, but this film isn't neo Nazi propaganda, but gets more into the truths about why communism and agriarian reform cannot succeed in the past or current times.  Yes today there is a large percentage of the populace caught up in abuse of drugs especially the opiod crisis plaguing today's society, the aftereffects of crime, causing them to leech on others and the system to support them.

Nilbog is a city dominated by communism, the goblins are communist soldiers, it's denizens are the workers, and the witch is the mother leader hoping to spread communist influence everywhere.  The victim family is like the Romanovs during the Russian Revolution just trying to survive amongst a communist rebellion.

All in all this is the greatest film on communism out there for viewing.  Watch it and learn.",1517529600,,954,4.9748427672955975
