3996420,5,B002VKB0LU,"I recall sitting in the theatre saying this is the best movie he has made yet. I was not a fan at all of ""meet the browns"" but I own the rest of them. Not sure what changed but this one is the best movie of them all.",1263513600,,216,3.5208333333333335
3996421,5,B002VKB0LU,"Tyler Perry has done it again. I laughed, cried and laughed again at this wonderful movie. The singing in the movie was great. Gladys Knight's voice still sounds as good as ever. Keep making your movies Tyler and I will continue to support you.",1263340800,,244,4.568181818181818
3996422,5,B002VKB0LU,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it.  This is another fine display of Mr. Perry's wonderful talent.  Taraji played her part to the fullest and of course Madea was the best.  A good movie to add to any collection.,1262908800,,236,4.441860465116279
3996423,5,B002VKB0LU,This move is amazing and once again tyler perry shocks the world with his amazing talent and love! I loved it its dramatic sadfunny etc.you will truley love it!,1262044800,,160,4.551724137931035
3996424,5,B002VKB0LU,This is an excellent movie with a great storyline. I laughed and cried throughout the entire movie. The music is an added bonus - I would buy the DVD just for the soundtrack!! I don't know why anyone wouldn't enjoy this and I can't wait to see it again.,1260576000,,253,4.183673469387755
3996425,5,B002VKB0LU,"This movie was absolutely Tyler's best movie to date! Taraji P. Henson lived up to her Academy Award Nominated status and Adam Rodriguez blew up everybody's radar. He is absolutely here to stay in our hearts and minds and a sequel would no doubt be #1 opening weekend as well. Hint, hint Tyler!",1258934400,3,294,4.566037735849057
3996426,5,B002VKB0LU,"When Madea catches sixteen-year-old Jennifer and her two younger brothers looting her home, she decides to take matters into her own hands and delivers the young delinquents to the only relative they have: their aunt April. A heavy-drinking nightclub singer who lives off of Raymond, her married boyfriend, April wants nothing to do with the kids. But her attitude begins to change when Sandino, a handsome Mexican immigrant looking for work, moves into April's basement room. Making amends for his own troubled past, Sandino challenges April to open her heart. And April soon realizes she must make the biggest choice of her life: between her old ways with Raymond and the new possibilities of family, faith and even true love. I have all of Tyler Perry's movies and plays, and this movie is very entertaining. No one does it better but Tyler Perry.",1258588800,21,850,4.951048951048951
3996427,5,B002VKB0LU,"I really want to see this movie again, and i cant wait for it to come out..hurry",1255132800,2,80,3.764705882352941
3996428,5,B002VKB0LU,"I think every man and woman should see this movie. The actors and actresses were excellent. I have been in this situation myself and finally got out of it. We can always let bad men run our lives but once we wake up and see that we are better off without them we ""Can Do Bad All By Ourselves"". I can't wait until the soundtrack comes out because the music was excellent. Mr. Perry you chose the right people to do the music and I really felt like I was in church with the Reverand. Thank you for being so real.",1253145600,17,510,4.0594059405940595
3996429,5,B002VKB0LU,This movie is truly the best of Tyler Perry's that I have seen so far.  I am not saying that the others were not very good.  They were !  But this one with a different story line is precise in acting and deliberate with its message.  You laugh and cry at the same time. Your heart is touched with a deep message of hope in mankind revealed through finding peace with God. The entire cast must have been hand-picked after much prayer by Tyler Perry and his group.  They blended together with such depth of expression and acting.  Must say Tyler Perry is becoming a master with turning his plays into successful movies and as I know he would say 'all Glory to God !'  Go see this movie if you haven't and you will understand what I am trying to say !,1252972800,37,748,4.188811188811189
3996450,5,B002VKB0LU,This movie is amazing just like all of Tyler Perrys movies. You  can really feel God at work here. It broke my heart to watch those kids and know that so many kids out there live like that. So touching I want to give back it just puts life back into perspective.,1524787200,,262,4.038461538461538

3996454,5,B002VKB0LU,"I love all the Madea movies, but in this particular movie, when I heard Madea's version of the Bible, I was practically rolling on the floor in laughter!  I thought the acting was excellent with all the characters.  I felt all the emotions a good film could evoke.  I could really understand the pain and feelings of hopelessness portrayed by the character, ""Jennifer.""  My heart really went out to her, and I wanted to comfort ""Manny & Byron.""  I really enjoyed what this movie had to offer.",1524441600,,492,4.609195402298851

3996506,5,B002VKB0LU,"It's realistic. And heart-warming, while obviously being a fairy-tale romance. Although I don't like the cross-dressing thing for Tyler Perry, Medea is funny. Wonder if he could do it some other way to get the same effect.",1486080000,,222,5.027027027027027
3996507,3,B002VKB0LU,"I've given this movie three stars because Tyler perry does the same thing in
almost every one of his movies. there's a black woman she's having problems with
with the man that she's with and the only man that is going to treat her right
is the man making minimum-wage. he does that same plot in like almost every
movie--like really stop and think about that for a second. so you know it gets
the point where I'm just watching the movie for for the actors--meaning just to
see my favorite actress or actor. so that's what it is. the singing was great, I
really love the singing in this movie. so on the singing alone five stars, but
the movie and the movie plot and the repetitive dialogue, I had to give it a
three. thank you",1485820800,,725,4.260869565217392

She has to help her sister kids since she's now their only resources.  She finally has chance with real love with her Mexican tenant and repair guy only problem is she is dating a married man who even tries to rape her niece .  God all mighty is the star of this film with all the church services and songs to boot.  I love it to watch a ,movie and a church service at the same time how can you beat that.

3996752,2,B002VKB0LU,"Oh lord.  There's maudlin, there's trite, there's unbelievable, there's preachy, there's not-to-be-believed scenarios...and you'll find them ALL in this mess.  I don't deny that Tyler Perry TRIES to put forth a message in his movies, be it forgiveness, getting your life straightened out, helping others--that's all fine and well.  But he fails miserably at telling a believable tale.

His ""protagonist"" is usually Madea, a character who is mean, spitefull, snubs her nose at any kind of authority, gun-toting, church-going (ha, ha, ha), know-it-all.  And if that isn't bad enough, this character is so stereotypical, so over-the-top, that her character would not appear anywhere else.  The word ""buffoon"" comes to mind when watching the performance.  I would be willing to bet that if a caucasian director had tried to introduce this character, he/she would have been strung up by their goodies.  After all, Madea is Tyler Perry's creation (he plays her, for those who may have suffered a blow to the head) so I guess he feels he has carte blanche to do whatever he wants.

If it's not Madea the movie centers around, it's usually some battered, abused, drug addicted, woebegone female who you know is going to have this epiphany, turn her life around, and have some kind of spectacular wedding (with guest stars galone) in the end.  There's always the obligatory church scene(s) that are so predictable, and the majority of black males are as negatively portrayed as one could find.  And while most other characters in he movies change, Madea stays the same.

This movie is rated PG13 for language, adult situations, and an attempted rape.  Not recommended.",1424044800,,1659,5.077490774907749

I Love It great",1369872000,,95,3.75
3996984,5,B002VKB0LU,"""Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" is great! This is how the story goes: When Madea, America's favorite pistol-packing grandma, catches sixteen-year-old Jennifer and her two younger brothers looting her home, she decides to take matters into her own hands and delivers the young delinquents to the only relative they have: their aunt April. A heavy-drinking nightclub singer who lives off of Raymond, her married boyfriend, April wants nothing to do with the kids. But her attitude begins to change when Sandino, a handsome Mexican immigrant looking for work, moves into April's basement room. Making amends for his own troubled past, Sandino challenges April to open her heart. And April soon realizes she must make the biggest choice of her life: between her old ways with Raymond and the new possibilities of family, faith... and even true love.

The cast led by Taraji P. Henson (as April) & Tyler Perry (as Madea / Joe) is great! The story and screenplay and directing by Perry (who recently directed ""Madea Goes To Jail"" (2009, also produced and wrote the story and screenplay), & the upcoming ""Why Did I Get Married Too"" (2010, also produced and wrote the story and screenplay) is great!

The cinematography by Alexander Gruszynski (who also did the cinematography to ""Madea Goes To Jail"") is great! The film editing by Maysie Hoy (who has been doing the film editing to Perry's films since ""Daddy's Little Girls"" (2007, which he also directed, produced and wrote the story and screenplay) is great! The casting by Alpha Tyler (who has been working with Perry since ""Meet The Browns"" (2008, which he also directed, produced and wrote the story and screenplay) is great! The production design by Ina Mayhew (who has been doing the production design to Perry's films since ""Diary Of A Mad Black Woman"" (2005, which he also wrote the story and screenplay and produced) is great! The art direction by Mayne Berke (who also did the production design to ""S.W.A.T."" (2003) is great! The costume design by Keith G. Lewis (who has been doing the costume design to Perry's films since ""Diary Of A Mad Black Woman"") is great!

3997008,5,B002VKB0LU,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. Madea catches three (abandoned) children trying to steal food from her.
2. She befriends them and puts them to work and puts them back in touch with a selfish relative.
3. The relative finds redemption in the process of caring for the children and ending the relationship with her married boyfriend.

This really is a typical Tyler Perry movie, and it is on a theme that he has visited before (Redemption--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tyler-Perry-s-Madea-Goes-To-Jail/dp/B002HGU8IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tyler Perry's Madea Goes To Jail</a>). Still, it's not a bad use of a couple of hours.

The theme is easy enough to follow, and he is actually putting someone to work (instead of a bunch of negative, vitriolic complaining about NOTHING and commentary on issues that NO ONE cares about-- i.e., Spike Lee).

Verdict: Reommended for the rental price.",1364428800,,937,5.768115942028985

3997097,4,B002VKB0LU,I enjoyed this movie very much. It was one of the best from Tyler Perry. I look forward to seeing his movies they always have a message in all of them that everyone can learn a lesson from. Taraji was at her best in this movie.,1321142400,,227,3.9565217391304346
3997098,2,B002VKB0LU,"When Tyler Perry came out with his first film, ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman,"" in 2005, you could forgive at least some of its many shortcomings, because at least his heart was in the right place.  Also, since it was a first effort, you would expect his work to improve with each succeeding effort.  Unfortunately, he's shown little improvement since then.  ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself,"" is Perry's eighth film and just another example of his lack of talent as a writer and director.

The basic premise of ""I Can Do Mad All By Myself"" is decent enough.  A selfish nightclub singer, April (Taraji P. Henson) is forced to care for her neice and nephews, when her mother, who was taking care of the children, suddenly disappears. To complicate matters, April is in an abusive relationship and an alcoholic.  In capable hands, this film, at the very least could be a moving, if predictable story about redemption and reclaiming one's sense of self-worth.

Unfortunately, in the hands of Tyler Perry, this film is like watching an arguing couple yelling at each other in the street for two hours, broken up only by the arrival of the police. In other words, ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" has the subtlety of a train wreck.

It's not enough for Perry to show April's reluctance to take the children, she has to be down right nasty to them.  At every opportunity, April makes insulting remarks directly to the children.  This is not to say that there aren't people like April out there, but any filmmaker worth his salt is going to try his best to find the humanity in the character. Instead, Perry just makes April a monster.

Even when Sandino (Adam Rodriguez), a gentle immigrant laborer that is rooming in April's home along with the children, fixes up a dilapidated bedroom for the kids, April refuses to let the children sleep there.

As is typical of Perry's films, all of the major characters here are drawn with broad strokes. They are either very good or very bad.  Like April, her adulterous boyfriend Randy (Brian J. White), is also a monster, but of a more sinister kind.

In addition to the almost saint-like Sandino, other ""good"" characters include Pastor Brian (Marvin Winans) and Madea (Perry).  The latter character is of course found in nearly all of Tyler Perry's films.  The sassy and overweight character that butchers the English language is a throwback to the ""strong"" mammy roles played by Hattie McDaniel, Louise Beavers and Butterfy McQueen in the 1930s and 1940s. If it were not in a film with a predominantly black cast, the role would likely incite waves of protest among African Americans.

While Randy never redeems himself, April eventually comes around, but only after a ""revelation"" that occurs late in the film. Of course this is a revelation only to April and the other characters in the film, but not to the audience who saw it coming a mile away.

Tajari P. Henson is a talented actress, that when given a chance can be very engaging on screen.  She was very funny in ""Talk to Me"" and appealing in even minor roles, like her character in the recent ""Larry Crowne."" Unfortunately, her talent is all but wasted in ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself.""

On the plus side, there's some good musical performances here and at least some actors got a paycheck, but other than that there's very little to praise here.

Many filmmakers, but especially African American filmmakers, don't get the chance to make eight feature films. Perry squanders his opportunity here.  It wouldn't be so bad if Perry at least gave other writers and directors the opportunity to make films under his banner. That would at least provide filmgoers a viable alternative to Perry's efforts.  That's a shame, because there are so many talented filmmakers out there that deserve to have their stories told.  Perry even kept ""For Colored Girls"" for himself to both adapt and direct.  In that sense, Perry is much like April's character in ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself,"" selfish and unwilling to share.",1310860800,,3988,4.703597122302158

3997142,5,B002VKB0LU,"April's (Taraji P. Henson) niece, Jennifer, and her two nephews, Byron and Manny, need a place to stay.  She doesn't want anything to do with them because, Randy (Brian White), her married boyfriend, doesn't like children, but she lets them move in since they have no place else to go. But just until the one who has been taking care of them is found. Sandino, a good looking Columbian immigrant, is new in town and he also needs a place to live. Even though she's not happy about it, April allows this handyman to rent her basement. April sings in a night club and she likes to sleep all day, but now there are others in her space, and she isn't happy with the new arrangement at all.

April is a woman who doesn't care about anyone but herself. She's not a bad person. She's an unhappy person dissatisfied with her life and still burdened by things that happened in her past, so she has a wall up and she is determined not to let anybody in. She doesn't even like it when others tell her that they'll be praying for her. I don't know if she was angry at God or if she didn't think she deserved His love, but I was glad when she realized church was the place to go so she could begin to find peace. And as for the opposite sex, I don't think any man really cared about her until Sandino.

Sandino (Adam Rodriguez) is a man with a good heart. Bad things have happened to him in the past, but, unlike April, he isn't holding onto those experiences; at least not in a bad way. He reaches out to others - particularly children - because of what he went through. He is a very likeable character with lots of good attributes.

Sixteen year old Jennifer (Hope Olaide Wilson) didn't trust anyone because nobody ever gave her a reason to trust them. She wasn't used to anyone being kind to her unless they wanted something in return and that was sad. She had way too much on her for a girl her age; too many responsibilities and I'm thinking, too many bad memories. She wasn't just an older sister to her brothers, Byron and Manny; she was the one who took care of them. (All of them have been through a lot in their young lives). She was an angry girl who was always on her guard and that was understandable. She was also afraid.  I don't feel like I'm gonna make it - it was really heartbreaking to hear this young girl speak those words. I felt so bad for her.

I own only a few of Tyler Perry's plays on DVD and I watch his television shows on occasion, but I have seen every one of his movies and own all but one on DVD.  There are some movies where I couldn't see the Christian theme; however it is very strong in this film and I was glad about that. The church scene had me saying, Amen! Also, I enjoy the movies with Madea because she makes me laugh. She can be a wild woman but she is also a woman of wisdom (unless she's telling Bible stories :). What Madea said to Jennifer at the kitchen table was something this young girl needed to hear. I really liked that scene.

I Can Do Bad All by Myself:  I enjoyed the movie and I love to listen to Mary J Blige sing the uplifting song. It was also nice to see Gladys Knight and to hear her sing. And Marvin Winans' songs: You Just Don't Wanna Know /Over it Now/Oh Lord, I Want You to Help Me - so inspirational and healing. I was disappointed when I couldn't find a soundtrack.

3997194,1,B002VKB0LU,"As someone who has bought all Tyler Perry's movies to date, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Perry whilst successful and talented is mediocre at best.  This doesn't take away from his ability to make bank but the inconsistency of the quality of his movies makes him well...mediocre.

This movie to the average person just makes no sense.  It oversimplifies complex issues mainly because there has to be a happy ending and Perry must conclude all issues in the 2 plus hours this movie lasted for.  In future if Perry cannot address complex issues properly, just try to address fewer issues in one movie.

The characters are little bizarre at times.  The male love interest played by Adam Rodrigez is a little strange and his willingness to help the main female character played by Taraji Henson in the movie whilst admirable does not really make sense.

The only credit I offer is to Hope Olaide Wilson who plays `Jennifer', one of the children who is left orphaned in the movie with her siblings.  Her acting skills should not go unrecognized.

The whole movie doesn't make sense.  There is a long church scene of what seemed like endless singing and point of scene: NONE.  In fact there are so many pointless scenes in this movie.  The ending for one is a wedding turned Mary J Blidge concert, really bizarre and unrealistic.

As a lover of Tyler Perry I have to say that this is the worst movie of all time and a testament to the fact the Perry needs to take more time to make his movies rather than keep churning them out.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to a soul.  If work is good, it deserves praise but to be honest, Perry deserves a wakeup call for this one, it's a pile of illogical nonsense at best.",1270252800,10,1715,4.504854368932039

3997232,4,B002VKB0LU,"Have you ever had to make a decision that you knew would change your life forever? In I Can Do Bad All By Myself making a life changing decision is exactly what April (Taraji P. Henson ) has to do. After finding the three youth looting her home Madea (Tyler Perry) sends the kids to the only relative left, their Aunt April. I Can Do Bad All By Myself deals with tough issues, emphasizes the importance of family, and comedic value. When these three elements are put on screen the result is one great flick.
A part of what makes I Can Do Bad All By Myself so great is that it deals with though issues. Tough issues are what drive the story of April and her niece Jennifer and nephews Manny and Byron. April is an alcoholic night club singer and lives with her married boyfriend. The pair loathes the idea of having the children in their home, cramping their style and interrupting their Addiction and the effects of addiction are depicted in April's alcoholism and the death of Jennifer, Manny, and Byron due to drug addiction. As the film develops deep issues behind addiction such as rape and molestation come to the surface. The past has hardened not only April but the children who have been given to her to care for as well. Only the care of those from the church down the street and a Sandino, Colombian immigrant trying to redeem himself begin to soften the heart of this tragic family.
 Though this family has gone through so many trials I Can Do Bad All By Myself emphasizes that only a loving unified family can overcome. The importance of family is shown by 16 year old Jennifer who is willing to do anything to help stabilize her brothers lives even steal from Madea. Even April eventually comes around and put aside her selfish addiction and desires for the good of her niece and nephews. The family is adopted into the church and church members and staff help the family throughout the entire film, even Madea plays a role in training up this family to love one another.
 Madea aids this movie not only with her love and kindness but also her witty and at times violent humor. Madea is an ""old school"" elderly woman who doesn't have much tolerance for disrespect and will let you know when you are crossing a line you shouldn't. Madea give great comic relief to a film that has so much misfortune. Even Madea's feeble attempt to evangelize to Jennifer is done in brilliant humor in Madea's incorporating the Biblical stories of Jesus' walking on water, Jonah and the whale, and Noah and the ""St. Louis Arch"". Comic relief is really what makes this movie worth watching for me; otherwise the intense situations this family deals would become overwhelming.
 I Can Do Bad All By Myself follows the basic formula for most of Perry's films, a family who is in dire need of help, who is wrecked by tragedy but gets through because of God's grace and the love of family, and Madea who makes it funny and lovable. I would recommend this movie to more mature movie goers because there are some intense scenes that children should not watch. I Can Do Bad All By Myself is a story of failure and success, addiction and sobriety, and how letting God love you can allow you to love yourself and others.",1268697600,,3203,4.518965517241379

The story was all over the place, there were forced performances by big named singers for no apparent reason and I could barely make it through the first 20 minutes. When is Hollywood going to stop putting so much money behind movies with absolutely no substance? Shame on them for making this film and making us pay to see it.",1267488000,6,503,4.6

3997279,5,B002VKB0LU,Tyler Perry has written another great hit but the actors that brought this story to life were phenonenal! Taraji plays an alcoholic nightclub singer trying to drink away an abused past with Brian White playing her married and devious boyfriend along with 3 child actors who were outstanding!

HE did it again...

Great storyline and actors throughout.

Whew! Power is what I have to call the main character. She was AWESOME! That woman played the hell out of that part! Every emotion known to man and woman was portrayed in this movie by this character. Absolutely awesome! You need to be sitting down to fully enjoy and receive the messages here.

It deals with sexual abuse, abusive men, race issues, sisterhood, female-male love/adultery relationship issues, the mourning of death issues and the list goes on. It is so powerful, it even allows laughter to sneek in during all of the drama!

3997302,3,B002VKB0LU,"I have every Tyler Perry dvd to date.  I enjoy Tyler Perry's writing, directing, producing and acting.  Tyler Perry has a knack putting the right hollywood actress/actor into his characters.  I Can Do Bad All By Myself has a good story line/plot.  What ruined the movie is the character MADEA being written into the story/plot.  WHY????  Made no sense, very distracting, nothing to do with the story.  Bad attempt at ""comedy?""  Should have been ANY ONE but the character of MEDEA for the plot to build around.  Otherwise, the acting was very good.  Taraji P. Henson has a great future as an actress, as does Adam Rodriguez.  Mary J Blige and Gladys Knight need acting lessons and should never have been written into the script in the first place.  This one is average Tyler Perry, disappointing to say the least.  If you are a Tyler Perry collector like I am, buy it and be disappointed with me.  If not, wait for it to come out on TV and save your money.",1266624000,3,955,4.508771929824562
3997303,2,B002VKB0LU,"I don't usually watch Tyler Perry films and this is only the second one that I have ever watched; Daddy's little girls is a favorite of mine.  My knock on his films has been that the story line lacks complexity and there are a lot of jumps the viewer must take for the story to progress.  I totally found that to be the case here.  While I was excited about Taraji Henson and Adam Rodriquez, two actors that I actually like, in this movie I thought that they weren't given much to work with.  For the life of me I couldn't understand why Adam's character would fall in love with Taraji's.  I mean she was angry and mean to him and everyone around her the whole time.  I mean come on, an attractive single man is going to fall in love with a woman who is sleeping with a married man who not only disrepects her, but threatens you while using racial slurs, and is a pervert to the young girl under her care.  He falls in love with that?  He tries to pull some of it together at the end--why she has demons and why he relates so well to the kids, but I had to force myself to buy their relationship.  Not the worse movie I've seen, but it reaffirmed what I don't like about his movies and I am less likely to see any ""Madea"" movies in the future.  I would say the best part of the moview was the opening bit with Madea and the older guy and the kids but it went downhill fast after that.",1266451200,4,1384,4.07380073800738

I always buy Tyler Perry movies sight unseen, because they're just that good.  I love the family oriented plots, and the way he handles social issues of the day, always keep plenty of tissues nearby.  Madea is my all time favorite character, full of good old fashion mother wit that is surely needed with todays youth.

I have never in my life purchased soundtracks from any movie, but I do with Mr. Tyler pieces.  I'm on a waiting list with Amazon right now for the cd of this movie.  Can't wait for ""Why Did I Get Married 2"".

There's always the abused woman who finally realizes how bad her life is, takes action and ultimately finds true love.  The rest of the intense moments and story are just padding for the rest of the movie.
