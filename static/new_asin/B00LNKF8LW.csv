6493583,3,B00LNKF8LW,"Living near the beach and always inspired by the sea and its inhabitants, including surfers, it is a tad surprising (and disappointing) to learn that some of those engaged in such a soulful, freeing experience, would harbor such inhumane behavior-- BUT, there should probably be a distinction between the world of competitive surfing, which this film is clearly focused on; and the regular folk who surf for fitness, fun and inspiration. In my own experience, though I do not surf, a few of my closest friends have been surfers-avid, bona fide, blond-boy, hetero, surfers. I never got a negative vibe from them because of my race or my sexuality, of which at least one was totally aware. We were buddies. Thus, it needs to be mentioned, at least, that while the competitive world of surfing, as in many other competitive sports(and the corporate world that sponsors them), is indeed in violation of human rights, this doesn't tell the whole truth or the whole story of those who tow their boards to the sea in search of the perfect, endless wave.  It isn't entirely clear from this ""documentary"" that the much larger group of surfer enthusiasts, students and other such non-professional surfers harbor such blatant discriminatory practices. The filmmakers have conflated the two a little, but with a much heavier dose of the competitive, professional world of surfing and the prevailing attitudes not only of homophobia, but sexism and racism. Bravo to those who say, competitive surfing must grow, be inclusive and follow the spirit of the laws of the land as well as the letter. There is a lot of talent out there and many are not blond, male and heterosexual. If the sport wants to grow (maybe it doesn't), it should take a page from the play book of many successful corporations--i.e.,DIVERSITY pays big dividends and the human rights of all is the right thing to do, inculcate and continuously aspire to. There perhaps could have been a little more attention payed to the ordinary folks who support surfing by their attendance at competitive surfing events. When the folks who buy the tickets, t-shirts and magazines decide they want to see change among the competitors, sponsors and professional associations, will listen.",1424044800,4,2228,4.989247311827957
6493584,5,B00LNKF8LW,"I was born and raised in Hawaii, a state thats synonymous with surf culture, as well as the live and let live ideology (for the most part).  I suppose I never thought about the possibility of gay surfers out there; however, its certainly not surprising, given that stats say 1 in 10 fellow human beings are homosexual.  As the taboo topic of homosexuality becomes more and more prevalent in professional sports these days, OUT In The Line-Up catches the wave of coming outs, and takes a foot-hold in a sport that waxes an overtly misogynistic veneer of macho dudes and bikini-clad T&A babes.  Ian Thomson gets writing and directing credit on this highly enjoyable, thought provoking, and ultimately empathic documentary about being gay or lesbian in a male-dominated sport.  Producer, founder of www.gaysurfers.net, and gay surfer himself, Thomas Castets posed an Internet enquiry to find out if there were fellow gay surfers out there in the world.  That enquiry made headway in opening up a (no doubt, surprising!) worldwide dialog, giving isolated souls a spirit of camaraderie:  a familiarity and trust existing between friends.

The film is a framework of interviews of professionals and non-professionals in the surfing community.  Through happenstance, (former state champion) David Wakefield found Mr. Castets Web site; thus, the catalyst for a friendship and coming out for Mr. Wakefield.  Both gents then joined forces in their pursuit of meeting fellow like-minded/like-lifestyled surfers.  What Mr. Thomson has come up with, through these interviews, is a great deal of insight into what had probably been quite a lonely world for many of these folks.  Although this film is obviously specific to this sport, these characters feelings of isolation and (in many cases) the guilt and/or shame of leading double-lives are universal to any form of discriminatory oppression.

Through well-shot interviews, we break the surface of secrecy and subjugation that, unfortunately, must be endured in not only this sport, but the entire sporting industry.  To be a sports professional, who so happens to be homosexual, and forced to live a life that is directed by advertising sponsors and magazines, as well as living with the intolerance from your peers, is, without doubt, a heavy burden that has, sadly, taken its toll.  The interlineation of a sub-storyline of Bra Boy surfer, Benjamin Roper, along with the inclusion of a benefit for Surfers Against Suicide, drives home the ramifications of this oppression.  Interviewee Robbins Thompson also speaks candidly of his brush with suicidal thoughts as a young surfer.  Interviews with surfing elites Cori Schumacher and Keala Kennelly also expound upon the struggles of trying to lead double-lives.

Ultimately, though, OUT In The Line-Up is not a dour and somber film.  Its an uplifting film!  The fact that these people are all the better for being out in the open is good enough to push for more gay films that depict the LGBT village in a more positive and normal light.  This film shows people who are simply people:  not flamboyant stereotypes that are fed to the masses via sitcoms and motion pictures.  OUT is a film of people who have become stronger and happier being themselves:  open, confident and self-assured in who they are.

At a succinct 69 minutes, OUT In The Line-Up puts good use into those minutes.  There are some beautifully composed opening shots.  And whats a surf film (gay or straight) without surfing?!  OUT has a good number of those, too; as well as a smattering of vivid underwater photography.  And, too, theres a good ear for popular musical tracks.  Editing is fluid, for the most part.  A particularly fine piece of creative editing comes with a fade-out at the start of the interview with Dave Prodan of the Association of Surfing Professionals  an interview that was initially given the go, but, ultimately, was rescinded.  (Mr. Castets gave me an amusing anecdote on that scene.)  Production values are top-notched, esp. for being a micro-budget docu.  A particular sequence has some loud background noise that makes the interviews a little hard to decipher  Mr. Castets told me that, unfortunately, it was inherent in the taping of that scene and couldn't be removed  but, overall, the audio is terrific.

My favorite character, without question, is young, lanky, deep-voiced, Riley Herman (who eschews the gay stereotype), stating that [b]eing out has made surfing a lot more enjoyable.  Im not hiding anything.  When I go out there, its like  I can look at the people next to me, and just be, like, Whaddup?  You know, Im surfing, too.  [And] I like dudes.  His whole laidback, matter-of-fact persona and laissez-faire attitude is winning, and it brought a big smile to my face!

In sum, Ms. Kennelly states that [t]he way I express myself best in this life is through surfing, not through who Im sleeping with.  That, too, pretty much sums up the whole point of OUT In The Line-Up, both in surfing and in everyday life.",1417305600,2,5016,5.033980582524272

8666957,1,B00LNKF8LW,I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  The whole 'secret' world of surfers and their struggles and triumphs was bizarre.  The only thing we could think of was this was some self serving motivated therapy for the cast.,1430697600,,223,4.6923076923076925
8666958,4,B00LNKF8LW,"Loved the surfing video footage and real-comments from those in this documentary. Towards the end of the movie I was rather tired of the self-labeling and search for official recognition from others. Perhaps the focus should be on just ""being""....being the genuine you and pursue your passions no matter what others say or think.",1429920000,,329,5.111111111111111
