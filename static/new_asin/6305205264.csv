7884901,5,6305205264,"This was the 25th In Your House PPV that took place on October 18th, 1998. The main feud heading into the PPV was the chaos between Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, Kane, and Vince McMahon. After Kane and Undertaker pinned WWF Champion, Stone Cold at the previous Breakdown PPV, Vince McMahon stripped Austin of the title the next night on Raw. Vince McMahon hired Undertaker and Kane as his personal protection enforcements from Austin with their reward being him handing them the WWF Championship. However, after they failed to save him from being attacked by Austin, McMahon decided to go back on his word and instead make them both fight for the title at the next PPV. To stir the pot of this rocky feud even more, Vince McMahon forced Stone Cold to be the referee for the match and threatened to fire him if he refused to. Thus the match was set.

1.) Al Snow vs Marc Mero w/Jacqueline

Nice opener from both men. Snow hits the Snowplow on Mero for the win

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) The DOA w/Paul Ellering vs LOD 2000

Nice Tag Team match that told a story as LOD's former 80s manager, Paul Ellering was managing the DOA in this match. LOD get the win. Droz had recently joined the LOD after Sunny had left earlier that Summer. LOD get the win after Droz pins 8 Ball, following a Doomsday Device from Hawk and Animal

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Match: Christian w/Gangrel vs Taka Michinoku (c) w/Yamiguchi-San

Nothing but an amazing match from both men. Lots of back and forth technical and high-flying action from both competitors. I wish this match had lasted a bit longer than it did because it was an awesome match. Christian wins his first singles title in WWF after reversing Taka's finisher intro a cradle pin for the win

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Val Venis w/Terri vs Goldust

This match came about when Goldust had a change of heart, transformed to Dustin Runnels as a born again Christian and began criticizing a lot of the sexual content the Attitude Era was offering.  During this time, Terri went behind Runnels' back and had an affair with Val Venis. Shattered by this revelation, Runnels began carrying a sign saying ""He's Coming Back"". Some figured he was talking about Jesus in the 2nd Coming but the sign was actually referring to Goldust. Runnels transformed back to his alter ego, Goldust and was booked for a match with Venis. A solid, grappling match that seemed too long but is still somewhat of a joy to watch. Goldust gets the win after kicking Venis below the belt, while the referee had his back turned, dealing with Terri

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF European Championship Match: X-Pac w/Chyna vs D'Lo Brown (c)

I was never an X-Pac fan and felt that he was a boring wrestler but he and D'Lo had a nice feud in 1998 and fought on several different occasions. A nice, resilient match that lasts a fair amount of time. Chyna gets involved at one point and Mark Henry eventually comes to ringside to make sexual advances towards Chyna and help out D'Lo. X-Pac reverses D'Lo's Lo Down into the X-Factor for the victory

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws vs The Headbangers

Prior to the match, the Headbangers cut a backstage promo on the Outlaws with Mosh saying the only thing the Outlaws were tag teaming was each other. Gotta love the Attitude Era. I never really cared for the Headbangers but for some reason, I was drawn to them in this match. Maybe it was because of their great Tag Team performance. The match ends on a DQ after Road Dogg crashed a boombox over Mosh's head

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Ken Shamrock (c) vs Mankind

I love this match! Good ground work from both men a ton of great ring psychology. Playing this match in WWE 13's Attitude Era Mode was frustrating beyond belief but watching it here is a different story. This match gets nearly 15 minutes of time, which is just enough for Shamrock and Mankind to give fans a great match. Nearing the end, Shamrock locks Mankind in the ankle lock. Mankind refusing to tap out, knocks himself out with his own Mandible Claw. Shamrock becomes outraged when he realizes that his ankle lock didn't win the match an attacks the referee. Mankind awakens, puts Mr. Socko on and takes Shamrock down with the Mandible Claw

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Mark Henry vs The Rock

After the Nation effectively split, Mark Henry and The Rock had a bit of a score to settle. The Rock was over with fans as a heel, which unofficially or maybe officially made him a babyface for the time being. Mark Henry reads a poem, dedicated to Chyna before the match and J.R. is disgusted. This was a short and basic grudge match. Mark Henry gets the win after a big splash on The Rock following an interference and assistance from D'Lo Brown.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Championship Match: Kane vs The Undertaker (Special Referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin)

Throughout the night, Michael Cole announced that a rumor was swirling on WWF.com about Paul Bearer going into the Undertaker's locker room and you knew that's all it took for you to know that something was going to happen in this match. The best thing about this match was that it added another chapter to not only the Austin vs McMahon feud but the Kane vs Undertaker feud as well. Austin flips off both brothers and the match begins. Kane and Undertaker brought down the house in this one and made this one another great battle of their feud. Unfortunately I feel a classic such as this one gets overlooked by their Wrestlemania bout they had earlier in the year. Stone Cold screws with both Kane and Taker, counting slow, counting fast, and refusing to count at many times in the match. Nearing the latter of the match, Paul Bearer comes to the ring with a steel chair and in probably the most shocking WWF moment of 1998, Bearer hits Kane with the chair! Kane turns to Paul and Undertaker takes advantage and nails Kane with the chair. Undertaker pins Kane but Austin refuses to count and hits the Stunner on Taker and counts Kane and Undertaker out. Austin announces himself as the winner and challenges Vince to fire him. Well enough, McMahon appears on a platform on top of the titantron and fires Stone Cold. Austin would soon be re-hired by Shane McMahon only to get screwed by him at their next PPV, Survivor Series

Overall: This was a really good PPV. 1998 was probably the best year WWF had, as I believe they had all great PPVs that year. Every match was great in its own way. We got a great and resilient Light Heavyweight Championship match, a great European Championship Match, a decent Tag Team Championship Match, and a classic WWF Championship Match! All the non-title matches were awesome as well! Judgment Day 1998 gets a 5/5 stars from me!",1399161600,,7412,5.195469798657718
7884902,3,6305205264,"This is one of those events that I was able to find through online sources with this one being the first ever edition of Judgment Day. At the last PPV, Vince McMahon's ""Master Plan"" to screw Stone Cold Steve Austin out of the WWF Championship worked with the help of the Undertaker and Kane. However, due to the outcome of Taker and Kane both pinning Austin at the same time, no WWF Champion was declared leading to this match between the two brothers with the special twist that Austin will be the guest referee that lead to various entertaining moments (Taker & Kane injuring McMahon's ankle, Austin's zamboni drive, ""Dr. Austin"" which also debuted ""Mr. Socko"", McMahon's corvette filled with cement). Also the added stipulation on Austin was that he would be fired if he doesn't crown a new WWF Champion but not before getting attacked by McMahon's new head of security, the returning Big Bossman.

Al Snow vs Marc Mero. Before the match got underway, Jeff Jarrett had come out to ringside due to an incident on Heat earlier in the night which involved ""Head"" getting in the way. This didn't go very long but they worked a good match with Mero showing flashes of his previous high flying style along with Snow's comical interactions with ""Head"".

LOD 2000 & Droz vs Disciples of Apocalypse (8-Ball, Skull and Paul Ellering). This was the end of this feud which resembled each match that these two teams have had in which it was real slow and dull for the most part but it was kept short with the bigger story being what happened between Hawk & Droz that would begin the ""Drug Pusher"" angle (the less about that, the better).

WWF Light Heavyweight Champion Taka Michinoku vs Christian. This was Christian's PPV debut while this was one of the rare times that the Light Heavyweight Title would be defended on PPV despite taking having it for almost a year at this point along with the fact that Edge (who was feuding with Gangrel at the time) was in the audience looking on. Christian started off on the offense before Taka was able to take over with his high flying style and even do little things to put over his heel persona. This was a fast paced match with a shocking conclusion.

Goldust vs Val Venis. This marked the in-ring return of Goldust after months of Dustin playing himself. The mind games started early as Goldust interrupted Val's prematch routine. Val was more aggressive than usual here as he took the fight right to Goldust before both men traded offense while working on a specific body part. Terri didn't really become a factor till the end which resulted in Goldust getting a measure of revenge on Val in a way that would have had every man in the arena in pain in what was a good match & tons better than their previous encounter.

WWF European Champion D'Lo Brown vs X-Pac. This was a rematch from RAW a few weeks prior where D'Lo had won the title but what wasn't mentioned was the fact that these two had a series of matches going on at this point. The backstory to this match was if X-Pac was 100% due to competing in the Intercontinental Title Tournament earlier in the week. Both men traded offense back and forth with D'Lo focusing on X-Pac's neck while outside parties such as Chyna and Mark Henry got involved in the match in some way. Out of their series at this time, this was their best match as they worked really well with each other and got the crowd into the match the longer it went.

WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws vs The Headbangers. Headbangers had recently turned heel and showed their new style by attacking the Outlaws during their usual prematch introductions. Outlaws were able to recover and gain control before the Bangers were able to isolate Road Dogg for a good portion of the match till Billy Gunn got the hot tag. Mosh & Thrasher were able to stop that momentum and focus on Gunn to the point where Road Dogg couldn't control his emotions and got some payback with a jutebox. This was a good showcasing for the HeadBangers as they used the traditional heel tactics in a tag match while the Outlaws played the ""faces in peril"" which was rare at the time to see resulting in another good match.

Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs Mankind. This match stemmed from the last month's Cage match involving these two and The Rock with the added twist being that Shamrock had won the tournament on RAW making this an Intercontinental title match. Both men went back & forth with Shamrock focusing on Mankind's ankle along with giving Mankind a receipt for what happened last month. However, the real highlight was Mankind's promise to not submit to Shamrock resulting in him doing something nobody expected. This was a good competitive match.

The Rock vs Mark Henry. Before the match, we got another poem from Mark Henry in regards to Chyna. This was pretty much to finish off the Nation as Rock was the number one contender for the WWF title (which for those remembering, he didn't get) as Rock got on the offense right away before Henry slowed things down to take control. Rock was able to gain control back before the interference of D'Lo Brown lead to a result that nobody saw coming.

WWF Championship w/Special Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Undertaker vs Kane. For those keeping track, this was the fourth time that these two would face off in 1998. Austin made it clear by the opening instructions that he was gonna let this one fly as evident by refusing to count either man out & even offering weapons such as a chair and cable cords. Taker was able to sucker punch Kane right from the getgo before both men traded offense with Austin showing Taker early on that you can't trust Austin. This evolved into a very slow paced brawl with Taker heavily working over Kane's knee with various submissions. However the big story came when Taker and Kane decided that they had enough Austin that lead to the appearance of Paul Bearer showing whose side he ""REALLY"" was on before Austin returned the favor right back to Taker & Kane by counting both men's shoulders down.

Right after that, Austin went on search for McMahon with moments such as confronting Michael Hayes, running into Owen Hart (who was claiming to be retired at the time). However Vince McMahon would show up in the Skybox with the Big Bossman at his side and delivering on his promise to fire Austin with Austin closing things out with a beer bash but also a warning to Vince that this was not the last of Austin (which wasn't due Shane McMahon rehiring Austin a few weeks later on RAW).

Overall, this was one of the rare ""B'level"" shows in which good in-ring action followed along with good storylines and while there wasn't anything memorable about this card, there were only two bad matches but were kept short while every other match was good so I would recommmend checking this one out based on that alone.",1241913600,,6858,4.603927986906711
