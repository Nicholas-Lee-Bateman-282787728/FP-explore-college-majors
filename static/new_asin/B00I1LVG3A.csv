8638238,5,B00I1LVG3A,This is a great DVD set for all levels and really shows how basics are important. Great breakdown on techniques by Renato Migliaccio. This has definitely made me fall back to the basics and add those details to up my game.,1460764800,2,222,4.439024390243903
8638239,5,B00I1LVG3A,"What an incredible DVD set! I'm always looking for instructional videos on YouTube, and I have to say there is a world of difference in the level of quality is apparent right from the start. You really do get what you pay for, or in this case you get way more than what you pay for. Not only does Renato cover sweeps, submissions and passes but he also goes even further than that. It's obvious that Renato has a wealth of experience with takedowns as well and he breaks them down in such a way that has already improved my game. As a wrestler I didn't think that my takedowns would be improved from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu but this DVD series has added some awesome stuff to my game (I look forward to using on my training partners).
The real brilliance of this system is that it focuses on breaking down the techniques on an easy to understand level and then builds from there to the more advanced techniques. A lot of other systems try to teach all kinds of fancy techniques without a grounding in the basics, which used to be really appealing. As a Blue Belt I think that it's so clear that the fundamentals of the art are...fundamental. I just got this DVD set last week so I look forward to going over it all again and trying out these techniques on my training partners.",1460678400,2,1273,4.352941176470588
