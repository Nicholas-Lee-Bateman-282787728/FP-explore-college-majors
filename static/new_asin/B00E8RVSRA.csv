8602714,5,B00E8RVSRA,"All three of the movies in this set are great fun, but my favorite is Delta Delta Die. Julie Strain was excellent, and the B-movie world hasn't been the same since she retired. Bleed is also really good. Voodoo Academy is good if and only if you like to see young guys half-naked. However, it feels out of place on this set, as it isn't a slasher.",1472601600,,347,4.1940298507462686
8602715,2,B00E8RVSRA,"A poor effort, depending more on nudity than acting talent, though the video and audio was good",1461715200,,95,4.647058823529412
8602716,5,B00E8RVSRA,"I wound up buying a Full Moon Entertainment 3 DVD Pack at a 7-11 about a month & a half ago.  I wound up liking it so much I bought several others including this one.  Delta Delta Die is the best one about a cannibal Sorority.  Bleed is almost as good about a girl who thinks her boyfriend is part pf a ""Murder"" Club.  And Voodoo Acadamy concerns a Secret Satan Worshiping Bible college.
  Overall I wasn't disappointed by this set",1450224000,,431,4.2592592592592595
