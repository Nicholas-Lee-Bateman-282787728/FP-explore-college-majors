2042170,1,B0001XARMW,"With all the interesting lightly explored topics of World War II why waste time on might-have-beens of low probability? This was as bad a production as I have ever seen from the history channel. The title was misleading - I expected people cleaning their files, perhaps something on the ""Imperial Conspiracy"" or the impact of the end of the war on the colonial people, but not this trash.",1188777600,3,388,4.720588235294118
2042171,5,B0001XARMW,"I have viewed a lot of WWII documentaries and still I find things I never knew about! This set of DVDs gave me so much information that I haven't received from the many , many others! Thrilling and exciting , compelling and informative is all I can say to describe this set! BRAVO !!! And the low price it was offered at cant be beat either....",1182297600,7,344,4.2272727272727275

8017708,3,B0001XARMW,"I must have misunderstood the info on the site because WWII had two parts European theater and Pacific theater. This DVD only has the European part; I required the Pacific part in a specific week and this DVD did not have the info I was seeking

Aside from that it makes a great addition to my WWII library!",1400803200,2,307,4.293103448275862
8017709,5,B0001XARMW,"Brilliant and mesmerizing!  Brings out ideas and facts I never knew  in stunning newsreel footage and fascinating personal interviews. If you thought you knew World War II, you probably need to see this, so that new insights can be revealed to you about the closing days of the war and their lingering effects to this day.",1378080000,,322,4.732142857142857
8017710,5,B0001XARMW,"I had this on VHS recorded from the original TV broadcast; I was glad to get it on DVD and it was as good as I'd remembered it.  The extra features were good, too, but not up to the standards of the main features and could have probably been edited a little better.  Still, well worth the purchase.",1355443200,,298,4.120689655172414
8017711,3,B0001XARMW,"I was looking to purchase ""The Last
days of
wwII"" that is shown on Netflix. This one has the same cover but is not the same. This one spends too much time on Nurenbueg trials and the gold and art works.
I wish I could find the one I wanted. It's about 14 hours total.",1313884800,10,267,3.8727272727272726

8017713,4,B0001XARMW,"I was surprised at a couple of the negative reviews of this DVD. Yes, this is the older ""Last Days of WWII"" produced in the 1990s (there is a newer version, available from The History Channel's website which has over 20 one hour segments - that one is excellent, though expensive). This DVD is not at all a 'cheap production'; it is well-made and gives some good information about WWII, and not all about the end of the war. For example, the segment on Karl Haushofer and his influence on German thought in the early 20th century (through the study of Geopolitics, the World Island, the heartland, etc) is very interesting. In addition, the long segment on the research by the Japanese on chemical and particularly biological weapons and the systems to deliver them (smart bombs, long range bombers, special carrier subs) is also very interesting, and one of the least-known aspects of WWII. The Japanese had extensively tested biological weapons in particular in China during the war; at least one outbreak of plague is linked to these tests - and they were field tests on live populations where it is thought that as many as 100,000 Chinese civilians died. If the Japanese and Chinese archives of this time are ever made available, perhaps the extent of these tests can be confirmed, but for now, this DVD, though made over ten years ago, is quite interesting and has stood up well to more recent research on German, Japanese, and Italian research into smart bombs and long-range bomber technology. This DVD is well-worth purchasing and is a good value. Of course also try to get the longer, series (made in 2005) by the same name, from the History Channel's website. It is excellent, but is complementary to this one.",1266364800,9,1720,4.775167785234899
8017714,4,B0001XARMW,The first disk is awesome. Lots of footage of bombing dresden and fighting in berlin. then theres a disk about the sinking of a ship by a uboat by maine. its interesting but its kinda slow.,1216857600,2,189,4.277777777777778
