6888971,3,B00QV2I51M,"My son, who LOVES all things Thomas, was quite bored with this DVD.  He kept asked for different ones.  I think it's because almost all of the stories involve new characters.  I think Thomas is only in the whole DVD twice.  I think there are too many new characters being introduced for him to get invested.  They are cute stories, as always, but it's not my son's favorite.",1425772800,2,374,4.4411764705882355

6888990,3,B00QV2I51M,Didn't realize at least half of this movie is Mr. Perkins reading a Thomas book. It isn't engaging to watch as the first half of the movie is cheesy cartoon pictures of the characters that are the scenes from the book. It is narrated by Mr. Perkins as he is reading the story. The second half of the movie is like the TV episodes.,1492905600,,330,4.171875

It's not a movie, but instead a compilation of multiple episodes, which is nice because sometimes we don't have time to watch an entire hour long Thomas movie.

6889013,2,B00QV2I51M,"Went from 1 to 3 stars and settled on 2... here is why: I am playing this DVD for my 2 year old on my PS4. The quality is horrendous. I play lots of videos that are not BluRay on the PS4 and none of them look this bad. The next thing is, he doesn't even like to watch this even though he's crazy about dinosaurs AND Thomas... because there aren't really dinosaurs in it. They're like... statues. And that's all.
