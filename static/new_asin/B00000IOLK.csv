Although the quality of the video was lacking it presented some good insight on suggies.  It's worth purchasing if you're thinking about adopting a sugar glider.",1156377600,,335,5.185185185185185
7911117,4,B00000IOLK,"While this video cannot boast of slick production values, it is still a lot of fun and very informative.  It's an hour long, and full of good advice in the areas of feeding, handling, bonding, caging, and breeding.  There are also some funny comedy spots thrown in for fun (such as a flying  sequence accompanied by music from ""Ride of the Valkyries"").  While there are a couple of statements made that I disagree with, overall  the video represents a thorough and accurate view of the requirements of  glider ownership.",956448000,11,520,4.786516853932584
7911118,4,B00000IOLK,"This is a good video to watch even if you don't own one of the little guys.  it shows what a great pet they can be if you spend time with them. How ever you can probably get more practical information from a book. still it  is worth watching. The ""bloopers"" at the end are quite funny to.",953078400,,288,3.9482758620689653
