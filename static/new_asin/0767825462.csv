A great 2 part episode of the 2 teams working together to save New York City from the spooks and demons. New gadgets and equipment for training for both teams. I still love this episode the best of this series.",1369267200,,329,4.409836065573771
7788908,5,0767825462,"EP tapes are horrible but there isn't much alternative is there?

1 episode is good, other not so. The fact that the old crew come back adds absolutely nothing much to this series that was superior from the start. The RGB is obsolete and gone. Pretty much all RGB episodes were crap in comparison. The original team as shown, is also obsolete.

Compared to RGB, XGB is faster, more serious, more dynamic, more mature, better written, better directed and sometimes even funnier, with much more content per minute. It has real atmosphere unlike the comical ground of the former. This superb masterpiece can sometimes even reach gripping atmosphere and true senses of emergency in the storylines. Never was a serious GB fan until I saw this. This has done great things for the GB universe.

Well done. Two thumbs up.",1125014400,,813,4.792857142857143
7788909,4,0767825462,"Not: Minor Spoiler ahead.
You'll have to forgive Sony for allowing a few jokes to be made at the Real Ghostbusters expense at the beginning of this episode. (Yeah they look real alright...real OLD).  But it does get better and the RGBs even end up saving the EGBs and showing off their moves in the process.  Oh and you'll have to see the EGBs faces when the RGBs show off some spectacular synchronized busting.  It's worth the jokes.  Just don't snap the tape in halfduring the first five minutes...",1004832000,,500,4.584269662921348

--------------------------------------------------

While the Extreme Ghostbusters series is top-notch, this video falls below average because it was recorded in the SLP/EP speed - which is usually reserved for those ""low budget"" $3.99 tapes you find on the discount rack at your local supermarket. To make matters worse, Columbia/Tristar Home Video doesn't even tell you on the video box that it was recorded in this speed. Anyway, the episodes are at least worth the money spent on this tape. (Maybe we can all pray that they release this on DVD.)",967507200,,1045,5.7727272727272725
