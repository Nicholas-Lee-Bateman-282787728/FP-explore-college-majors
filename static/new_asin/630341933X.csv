7845847,5,630341933X,"Now this is something new. A romantic/comedy set on a Japanese air base. ""Airbats"" does a great job of combining romance with some very funny humor. The characters are all very real and you can't help but root for the couples to get together. The flight scenes kick butt. You can watch this with your girlfriend.",1130025600,2,312,4.589285714285714

Do check your brain at the door, some of the things they do with those airplanes just can't happen, but it sure does make a great story.  If you want a good laugh, buy this video!  I laughed so hard, I was nearly rolling on the floor!  lol! Like this one  scene... roflmao!  What are you waiting for?  Buy it!",950140800,5,351,3.9285714285714284
