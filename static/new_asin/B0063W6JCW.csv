By all means..!!! Sorry Danielle but this feature should be titled <<Sweet Satisfaction Memphis Monroe>>.. This feature is the best Candygirl video ever. And it has the best picture quality ever.. what else to say? Good work Candygirl video..You are getting better all the time.. Waiting period between productions is well worth it.
Get that DVD.  And be sure to expect your <<temperature>> to rise to dangerous levels..",1261958400,3,591,5.344086021505376
4948630,1,B0063W6JCW,I just do not understand the fascination with this video. I certainly do not recommend it. Very boring and a waste of time. Save your money.,1259625600,4,140,4.423076923076923
4948631,4,B0063W6JCW,"Great video.  good lighting.  good editing.  good action.  good settings.

only thing I didn't like is that not as much ""girl next door"" types.  More strippers with fake breasts.",1257984000,2,178,4.9655172413793105
4948632,5,B0063W6JCW,"You really can't go wrong with Candy Girl Video. Only one that I have purchased,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CandyGirl-Video-Classic-Upskirts-Collector-s-Edition-2-Disc-Upskirt-DVD-set/dp/B0013XVD7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CandyGirl Video: Classic Upskirts (Collector's Edition 2-Disc Upskirt DVD set)</a>, was a true disappointment. All of the rest have been superlative.

This latest release is no exception, although it takes awhile to get its feet underneath it and it isn't nearly up to par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CandyGirl-Video-Sugar-Rush-featuring-Jenni-Lee-Autumn-Westin-Addie-Juniper-Kobe-Lee-and-more/dp/B001IBQF8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CandyGirl Video: Sugar Rush (featuring Jenni Lee, Autumn Westin, Addie Juniper, Kobe Lee and more)</a>&nbsp;or the Jasmine Grey releases.

First of all, this is a stylistic departure (somewhat) for Candy Girl. It skirts hard core more than any of the others. There are more silly attempts at acting. The first few releases were a lot of the faceless camera guy (literally...he shows up as a digital blur a few times on this DVD) and his kind of shy, awkward interaction with the girls. I loved this because first of all it prescribed a personality to the models, and second of all it made the viewer identify with the shoot...if you were there, you'd probably act about like this goofy camera guy who calls everything ""cool"" (""Spread your legs again...that's a really cool shot."")

There are more vignettes that made me scratch my head, that fall much more into fetish than the best of the other releases. For instance, Kobi Lee has a winter bush throughout the video. Yuck. Actually it's beyond that...it's like somebody stuffed a tribble down her pants. There's a whole segment where she sits on a glass coffee table that could have been hot except for the pubic hair and the ""open it up"" portions. I for one don't care to see a woman ""open it up""--for God's sake, this isn't a guide to gynecology for the home viewer.

But unfortunately there's a lot of that in this release, far more than in the other Candy Girl releases. I fast forwarded through those parts.

In so doing I got to Danielle Trixie, who is another amazing find. Wow, what a body, particularly if you like to see wobbling junk in the trunk. A lengthy segment during which she does nude exercise (most notably an awesome extended clip of her from behind on a stair-stepper...wow) is what brought my rating up from four stars to five. Her build is a lot like that of Penthouse star Shay Laren, although she's nowhere near as pretty. And again, she's got week-old stubble downstairs, which wasn't cool in my book. Maybe if (hopefully when) she is used again, that problem will be fixed.

Another good find is Memphis Monroe, who has enormous fake breasts (although not a terrible boob job). She added a lot to the show and hopefully we'll be seeing more of her.

That's another gripe that I have with this release...it appears as though Candy Girl is moving more and more toward implants. The early releases feature only natural-breasted women. Then one or two with implants would show up. Now it seems as though it's an even split. Not to my liking.

And what the heck happened to Autumn Westin? She clearly has lost a significant amount of weight since ""Sugar Rush,"" which has taken greatly away from her brick-house delightfulness. She was a disappointment this time around.

But the great thing about this and all Candy Girl releases is that there seems to be something here for everyone--you never get scrimped on content. More than two and a half hours!!! And worth the premium price that you pay.",1255219200,,3730,5.362393162393162
4948633,5,B0063W6JCW,"The ladies in this candygirl DVD production are beautiful.  Lots of tease.  Great scene with Kobe Lee in a red dress and the draft of air beneath her. No panties allowed with Paris Kennedy also opens the doors of erotic discourse. Candygirl seem to understand well that panties are just as important as what lies beneath and they never forget  how much the viewer loves panty crotch, often looking upwards, from beneath.

There are many other ladies on this production.",1247616000,5,469,4.825
8492287,5,B0063W6JCW,"Danielle Trixie is a totally hot.  She is one of the most beautiful women in the world in my humble opinion, even with her vitiligo.  Danielle Trixie, my, my, my...Besides her, there are other worthy parts of the disc, but I rarely watch it.",1361491200,,241,4.454545454545454
8492288,5,B0063W6JCW,"Hi everyone!  This one is for the adult fans who enjoy female nudity.  The ladies usually start out with some tiny, sexy panties but end up naked.  With beautiful bodies!  You get to see all the private parts of these pretty women but there is no boy-girl sex.  They do spread the soft lips between their hips!  They do provide girl-on-girl action a few times.  These are more soft-core pornography.  An X or XX rating.  No triple X.  Very well done like videos produced in the Peach video series if you enjoy women-only footage.  But different.  And very good!  I actually like the CandyGirl video series  a little better than the Peach series.  I just want to point out that two of the models, Danielle Trixie and Memphis Monroe, are worth the price of the DVD by themselves!  They do a wonderful job.  These two lovelies are gorgeous.  If you enjoy the CandyGirl videos, I highly recommend any DVDs in the series featuring Karen Money.  She's my favorite!  Absolutely stunning...
By the way, the soundtrack is excellent for this DVD, done by Mr. Deviant.
Happy movie watching!

Sincerely,
Norman aka Moveewatchur",1359849600,,1115,4.732984293193717
8492289,1,B0063W6JCW,"i only bought this for the one women on here i find sexy, paris kennedy. and this was really soft, i wish i would have seen or was told of one with more action.",1355443200,,160,3.735294117647059
8492290,5,B0063W6JCW,"hi;

i love the girls who made me very wet with pre cum.  i love it and plan to have a lot more orgasms if you help me.",1354320000,,119,3.2142857142857144
8492291,5,B0063W6JCW,I picked this one up strictly for Memphis and wasn't dissapointed. There's a part where Memphis is playing with her thong in a big yellow chair that gets pretty explicit and its like that all the way through the video. Memphis was my fave but I can see why the director picked Autumn as his fave. That video of her at the end is unbelievable. These guys aint afraid to get right in there. The video of Kobe on the glass table was pretty cool to. Definietly pleased with this one!,1343260800,3,479,4.274725274725275
8492292,3,B0063W6JCW,"Sure, they show everything, but I wouldn't give a nickel for the the girl/girl scene.  I might have been more impressed with the video if I'd watched it in the 1980's.",1342828800,,167,4.387096774193548
8492293,5,B0063W6JCW,"The latest CandyGirl Video DVD: Sweet Satisfaction is loaded with over two hours of lovely models in, and out of their lingerie. My personal favourites are ""Kenna Valentina"" and her bare vagina, ""Addie Juniper"" flashing in public and ""Paris Kennedy"" exposing her sexy vagina in a No Panties Allowed scene. This DVD is the best of all CandyGirl DVD's!",1326758400,4,350,4.9491525423728815
8492294,5,B0063W6JCW,"This is the third installment in CandyGirl Video's Sweet Satisfaction series and the featured girl this time around is Playboy's and Harold and Kumar's Danielle Trixie. What a lovely young lady! An all-natural blonde with a flawless figure and a hypnotizing smile. Danielle's best scene has to be where she exercises. First she demonstrates an exercise clothed and then unclothed! She works out on a stepper, a trampoline and an ab machine. The camera shots during this are scandalous!

As much as I enjoyed Danielle, she's not the real star here in my opinion. That honor goes to busty Autumn Westin who has two very sexy scenes. The first is an upskirt scene shot in public that has to be seen to be believed. I've never seen a lace thong this tiny before, and the way she wears it so low exposing herself in the process is the stuff dreams are made of... at least my dreams any way. Her other scene is an explicit nude scene and that's pretty self explanatory. The close-ups they get here are like nothing I've ever seen in any dvd of it's kind.

If those two were all that was on this disc, I would be happy, but we also get Paris Kennedy, Memphis Monroe, Addie Juniper, Kobe Lee, Kenna Valentina and Savannah Rae. These girls ranged from awesome to ok, with Memphis and Paris standing head and shoulders above the others. Addie was really cute, but her scene seemed too rushed, I would've liked to have seen more of her. The girl/girl scene between Savannah and Kenna was outstanding, but their individual solo scenes didn't quite satisfy. However, all-in-all I was beyond pleased with this release.
Great stuff, highly recommended!",1324944000,6,1637,4.700348432055749
8492295,1,B0063W6JCW,"Really? I bought this from all the 5 star reviews and I must say I disagree to the HIGHEST. You can find better for free in 2 mins on the computer or at the bargain bin at the local sex shop. The girls looked hot.....than they took their clothes off and it went down hill. Arbys must have sponsored this movie because these girls were showing some hideous roast beef, and too much hair. The girl on girl scene was boring, even girls gone wild has better. Overall, you want some porn, goto the local shop and pickup 5 in the bargain bin for cheaper than this and youd be wayyy better off. Ugly girls, boring and bad camera work. Avoid, I promise. I saw the 5 stars and figured must be damn good....no. Seriously.",1263340800,3,711,4.274074074074074
8492296,5,B0063W6JCW,"Candygirl Video: Sweet Satisfaction Danielle Trixie delivers just as the other Candygirl Videos do. The girls are beautiful. The scenes are hot. If you like upskirts, solo masturbation, tits, pussyplay, thongs, microthongs, flashing, and undressing, this is a great DVD for you. One Memphis Monroe scene is especially hot with spreading and finger insertion. MMMM. Candygirl is sweet.",1262044800,,384,5.637931034482759
