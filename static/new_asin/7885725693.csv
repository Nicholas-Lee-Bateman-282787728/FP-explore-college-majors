1129663,4,7885725693,"The Toni Braxton biopic is a better than expected project by Lifetime Pictures. The move is well cast for a TV movie, featuring Lex Scott Davis in the lead role. She bears a striking resemblance to Braxton, and is provided opportunity to show her acting skills. With that said, the music production numbers weren't the most convincing. I imagine budgets are tight, but biopics about musicians would be just a little more authentic if they wouldnt use the same venue and stage-set up for every concert performance.  Anyway . . . also well cast is TV veteran Debbie Morgan as mother Braxton. Together, these two actresses carry the drama and key moments of the movie.

It has to be a challenge to cram a life/career into 88 minutes, and the production does a good job of showing  albeit in a condensed way  Braxtons upbringing, music activities with her sisters, and her big break. The movie also portrays the reasons for her bankruptcy, as well as challenges with lupus, her autistic son, and balancing everything with her career. It also includes the relationship with her first husband.

For me, this Lifetime production was more enjoyable than the Whitney Houston project  which presented nothing as to how Houston got to be who she was. In contrast, the Braxton movie provides ample information to understand where Braxton came from, as well as know the highs and lows of her personal and professional life. And then theres the music. All Braxtons hits are included.  Braxton fans should be pleased with this project. All in all, I thought this biopic was both informative and entertaining.",1469318400,6,1593,4.877777777777778

1129666,3,7885725693,"Toni Braxton: The Movie Event is based on Braxtons memoir, Unbreak My Heart, and stars Lex Scott Davis as the R & B singer. Following the multi-Grammy winner from her discovery by L.A. Reid (Greg Davis, Jr.) and Kenneth Babyface Edmonds (Gavin Houston) to her battle with lupus, this Lifetime biopic includes her public divorce, her sons autism and family struggles, and how she overcame the challenges to become a pop sensation.

Biopics about musical entertainers sometimes go wrongheaded, as in 2015s Whitney, which cast an actor who doesnt come close to resembling the late Whitney Houston and didn't use a single note of that singers own voice. In the Braxton film, however, we get to hear the singers actual vocals lip-synched by Ms. Davis. As a bonus, Toni Braxton herself appears at the end playing the piano and singing Unbreak My Heart.

As with many biopics, events and time frames are jumbled a bit for dramatic effect, but this one follows Braxtons memoir fairly closely. The film unfortunately glosses over her cult-like religious upbringing, racial politics that caused her to pay her own expenses during her first tour with Kenny G, and battles with her manager that caused considerable disruption of her career.

The overall thrust of the movie is inspirational. If anything, it paints Braxton as perhaps too iconic. Everyone has flaws and they tend to show human frailty. As portrayed in this film, Toni Braxton is a legend whose sheer will led her to forge through adversity to the heights of show biz fame.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release. A digital copy is enclosed.",1465603200,,1611,4.911764705882353
1129667,5,7885725693,See every Renoir film you can even the lesser ones.  The imagery is great and the message is honest. A great film.,1371859200,,114,4.181818181818182
1129668,5,7885725693,"In the early 1930s, Toni, a young Italian labourer, arrives in France and finds work at a quarry.  His landlady Marie takes a liking to him, but he is only interested in another woman, Josepha.  When the latter is raped by Toni's thuggish foreman Albert, she must reject Toni and instead marry Albert.  Toni has no option but to take Marie as his wife, although it is soon apparent that they are ill-matched.  After attempting suicide, Marie becomes hostile towards Toni and drives him away.  Josepha's marriage to Albert proves to be just as disastrous.  Tired of being bullied and beaten, Josepha plans to run away with her cousin Gabi.  The latter coerces Josepha into stealing Albert's money whilst he is asleep.  Albert awakes before his wife can make her escape and takes his revenge by thrashing her with his belt.  In the heat of the moment, Josepha picks up a gun and shoots her husband dead.  Toni offers to dispose of the body, but in doing so he inculpates himself as Albert's killer.

This bleak tragedy was a real finding in the France of the early Thirties, but yet, the dramatic social impact that provoked resounded and reverberated to suchan extent that could be said so much that is very far from being a mere chance that the young Italian filmmaker by then, Luchino Visconti had undertaken the project in 1942 from James Cain's novel Obsession, a film that to my mind is the pioneer film of this famous genre.

For all movie buffs this is a film you cannot afford to watch.",1315008000,,1493,4.613636363636363
