8278829,5,B001AQY2I4,Complete and thorough workout from a real pro. It is a classic. I love doing it.,1496016000,2,80,4.0625
8278830,5,B001AQY2I4,Karen Voight's insturctions and routines have always been easy to follow.  Love the variety this DVD offers.  Can also mix and match cardio with any of the upper body/lower body routines with the back and abs portion.  Both beginner and intermediate can benefit from this DVD.  Just modify according to your ability.,1478908800,,316,5.019230769230769
8278831,5,B001AQY2I4,I love it because it covers everything. A really nice all inclusive workout. I am 60 and find it challenging but I think it would be for all ages. I have been follower of Karen for many years.,1461283200,3,192,4.078947368421052
8278832,1,B001AQY2I4,no i didn't like Karen much,1448409600,,27,3.6666666666666665
8278833,2,B001AQY2I4,"I've just completed all 3 sections of Half and Half -- cardio, weights, and floorwork. The cardio was uninspiring and NOT challenging. I did sweat a few drops, but at 27 minutes, I expected to sweat much more (Kick Max by Cathe for example, had me sweating buckets!).

The weights section of this DVD has a BRILLIANT 12 minute routine using a chair. Lots of squats and toning. This was the only good part of the whole DVD. I was sweating profusely, and I even had to pause in between changing legs. That's what I LIKE. The actual weights section however, was uninspired, slow, and had too few reps. I used 3 lb weights. If I were to ever bother with this DVD again, I would use 4 lbs.

The floorwork section wasn't very good either...I hardly saw the point of the cooldown when I was practically cold by that point anyway!

Not recommended.",1398988800,,840,4.441558441558442
8278834,4,B001AQY2I4,The chorography in this exercise video is very detailed.  Every time I work out to this video I loose the routine and break into a sweat. It is going to take some time to learn the routine. It just mean that I won't get  bored too quick. The cardio and toning are broken up into two segments which I find discouraging. After I finish one segment I wonder off. So far I have been going strong for two weeks. I like Karen Voight videos she is definitely motivating in getting me to participate.,1392422400,,492,4.279569892473118
8278835,5,B001AQY2I4,Excellent workout dvd. She is clear and descriptive in her instructions. I enjoy the freedom to pick and choose what workouts I have time to do.,1372204800,2,144,4.576923076923077
8278836,5,B001AQY2I4,"Love the exercises.  A little hard to follow some of it in the beginning.  But, love the flexibility and options of combinations of work outs.",1355961600,5,142,4.64
8278837,5,B001AQY2I4,"This is truly one of the best workout videos ever made. Karen is impeccable, as always, with great cuing and form. I love that Karen starts you off with a nice warm-up, because many instructors skimp on that. The cardio portion is fun and constantly changing, so you don't have a chance of getting bored! You have to think while you're doing it -- you can't totally zone out. The strength portions are excellent, and I felt my shoulders the next day. Not a full-on, crazy strength routine, but definitely enough to feel worked out. The ab work is interesting and varied, as is typical for Karen -- I got a great burn in a short amount of time. And, finally, Karen ends with a lovely cool-down. I adore that she leaves enough time for flexibility, because, again, many instructors skimp on that. Overall, this is a must-have in any exercise library. A true classic.",1342396800,13,864,4.580645161290323
