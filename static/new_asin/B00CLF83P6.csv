5725977,5,B00CLF83P6,"By the end of the second season, Eight is Enough had become the late 70's perfect family series that mixed comedy with some drama in between. Season three(1978-1979)continued that staple, especially during the first half of the season. If you grew up with the show, then you'll remember episodes like Cinderella Understudy, Milk and Sympathy, Cops & Toddlers, and the classic War Between the Bradfords, in which the family becomes divided by gender roles to seek equality and fairness(very funny). The Yearning Point and Mother's Rule also stand out, among other episodes in this collection. The second half of season three shifted to some storylines that were a little more on the dramatic, but not without humorous moments. Overall, light-hearted but believable, this would also be a great purchase for parents currently raising a family to share during some evenings when the household is considered as ""family night.""",1370217600,12,921,5.22972972972973

5725980,5,B00CLF83P6,"I bought this for my wife who really enjoyed watching it. The show is a favorite of hers but she never saw all the episodes when it originally aired. It's a show about a large family and all the things they go through, there are funny moments as well as heart-warming & sad moments. A great show for the whole family to watch. The picture quality and sound are very good. If you like family shows this is a must-see.",1423785600,,416,4.2125

5725990,5,B00CLF83P6,"This series is a classic for our family library. It is great to see this program come to DVD. Reality TV shows with large families have their place. But, we enjoy reminiscing over the classic sitcoms like Eight is Enough.",1393632000,,221,4.55

5725993,5,B00CLF83P6,"wonderful look back at this 70s favorite.  By the third year, the kids are growing and Abby and Tom are settling down to marriage.  Pricey DVD, but worth it if you love the series.",1385856000,2,180,4.264705882352941
5725994,4,B00CLF83P6,"Love the series, although several episodes the sound is delayed.  Seems to me that kind of problem should not be happening when they are supposedly all remastered to DVD.  We ran across that also with our season 2.",1385510400,,214,4.605263157894737
5725995,5,B00CLF83P6,Even though this show took place in the late 70's and early 80's it is a great family show.  My kids who are 17 and 20 love it.  It is entertaining and makes you laugh and cry and also makes us remember our teenage years.,1384473600,,221,3.888888888888889
5725996,4,B00CLF83P6,"Eight is Enough was a great show of the era with all the clothes and hairs styles that came along with it. If you want to watch a show from this era that isn't totally lame this will be right on the mark. Real issues,real drama,real jokes.",1377734400,,239,4.1063829787234045
5725997,5,B00CLF83P6,"As for myself, I love this ABC Aired Television Show from the 1980's, in my Opinion, I would have to say that it's Absoulity Fantastic, Super Family Show for the Whole Entire Family to go watching.  I have the first { 1st } Three Seasons, and now I am Patiently Awaiting for the Remaining Two { 2 } Seasons to come out onto DVD.  I hope it will be soon, it's so nerve racking knowing that there are just two { 2 } more Seasons to go, and the Company that has come out with this onto DVD is litterelly Dragging there feet with coming out with the Finial Two { 2 } Seasons.  I hope that the Finial Two { 2 } Seasons come out real soon.",1376179200,,633,3.9296875
8583043,1,B00CLF83P6,"I want to make it VERY clear that this one star review is ONLY for the quality of the product. If I was writing for a review of the show, 5 stars all the way! It was one of the happiest memories of my childhood. When I received the disks last week, LITERALLY 50% of the disks had some malfunction whether it was skipping, stopping or two disks that didn't work at all. Just poor quality from this distributor in regards to quality. I know when I order the last two seasons, I am going through another source. I may need to pay more, but this was just stupid.",1529280000,,558,4.128440366972477

8583045,5,B00CLF83P6,"Even though only ""Part 2"" is pictured for this item (and at least one reviewer has warned you will only received half a season), you will in fact receive the entire season Parts 1 and 2 (two separate DVD cases, each holding 4 discs) when ordering this Eight Is Enough:Season Three.

Discs are pressed (silver backed), not DVD-R (blue-backed)  Even though this is a Warner Archive MOD title, their initial run were pressed DVDs. Quality is outstanding--episodes look terrific, better than when originally broadcast.",1481241600,3,514,5.107142857142857

8583047,5,B00CLF83P6,"I feel like in Season 3, the Bradford family is finally coming into it's own.  Season 1 had Diana Hyland dying. Season 2 had Betty Buckley trying to fit in.  Finally, in Season 3, they are a family.  The chemistry with all of them is very evident and my favorite scenes (apart from the tearjerker ones) are the big family dinners.  It just seemed like it would be fun to be around the Bradfords.  Great family show that was sweet but not too sappy.",1453852800,,448,4.285714285714286
