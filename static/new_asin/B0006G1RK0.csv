8041466,5,B0006G1RK0,Like a private lesson with Ray.  Good time and great tips.,1409356800,,58,4.2727272727272725
8041467,4,B0006G1RK0,"Ray Benson is the reigning king of western swing guitar. He has extensive music knowledge and does a good job conveying it to the viewer. My main gripe about the video is that it is very informal, to the point that it seems to be an unplanned first run-through. There are a couple of brief instances where Ray seems to be uncertain about what to discuss next, and you wonder if someone off-camera is prompting him. Some of the discussion covers fairly advanced music theory, which may be beyond the current level of some viewers, but the video also does a good job showing how to play the music. If you are learning to play western swing, this video can help.",1407283200,,659,4.454545454545454
8041468,3,B0006G1RK0,"I found it a little confusing trying to match up the finger positions with the chords. Also it seemed to me that Ray was not always
consistent naming the chords. Still there is a lot to learn from this DVD. I may have jumped in at too high a level.",1373155200,,248,3.98
8041469,5,B0006G1RK0,"The source for Western Swing guitar.  It's recommended by many guitarists I know, so I decided to give it a spin.",1360972800,2,113,4.380952380952381
8041470,4,B0006G1RK0,"This DVD is definitely worth getting, in fact it probably is the best DVD for instruction on Western Swing that there is.

As far as that goes it gets a 5 out of 5. It comes with a nice 20 page book that has many good examples. You will have several good tunes and a basketful of licks to use, plus a good introduction to the so called, Western-Swing"" genre.

Ray Benson's presentation, is sincere and warm.

I'd like to see a ""Part 2""  get released  where an in depth theory of chord substitution is the emphasis. That would be a DVD for people that would want to go that deep into music theory, it would be great.

This DVD is great and an excellent buy, especially when you look at how much education you are getting for your money! A definite 9.5 out of 10",1276387200,7,760,4.171232876712328
8041471,5,B0006G1RK0,"First,let me say that this is a lesson for the intermediate/some experience guitarist but a beginner will see how the real deal is supposed to be done and may get some learning guidance in what he needs to learn first. Any mandolin/fiddle players out there will really enjoy Johnny Gimble's playing on this DVD also. Tim Alexander plays the piano accompaniment and can play in the original western swing style so darn well. Most anybody interested in western swing will learn something from Ray Benson as he is an encyclopedia of knowledge of the style. Buy this DVD for instruction or entertainment and you can't go wrong. Thanks.",1224028800,9,631,4.851851851851852
