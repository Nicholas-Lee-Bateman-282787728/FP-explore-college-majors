4842188,5,B005N4DQ8Q,"Bought this because my 4YO son (okay, my 30YO husband too) was very upset that football season was over. It's a great DVD! It has tons really tense end of game plays and it has different chapters that you can choose from. The DVD is quite long as well, keeping the boys occupied for a long time. It does have a lot of commentary which I actually really like but my son hates that part, he says they talk too much, he just wants to watch the football. So I guess that is just personal preference. It's a great DVD though and highly recommend!",1392940800,3,541,4.211538461538462

4842190,5,B005N4DQ8Q,"A year or two old, but it is very close to up-to-date that it is very good.  I really enjoyed watching it.  Went from all the way back to the beginning to present day from when it was published.",1389139200,2,194,3.948717948717949
4842191,5,B005N4DQ8Q,My 5yr old son and husband alike love watching this video! It has all the action they love to watch in football!,1389139200,2,112,4.136363636363637

4842193,4,B005N4DQ8Q,"No NFL Films production is bad but it would be nice if there was more coverage of noteworthy pre-Super Bowl era drives to glory. Each play of the legendary Johnny Unitas and Raymond Berry led Colts drive to Steve Myhra's tieing field goal in the last two minutes of regulation time in the 1958 NFL Championship Game should have been shown. The footage is available and has been used on other videos. The excellent bonus feature of the 1974 NFL Game of the Week production of the ""Sea of Hands"" game raised my rating of this DVD from 3 stars to 4.",1373328000,11,546,4.362745098039215
4842194,5,B005N4DQ8Q,"My son is 9 years old and absolutely loves football. He replays scenes from this video over and over and tries to re-enact them. Great, well-made video. I haven't actually watched the video {bad parent alert} but my husband has and likes it as well.",1359590400,7,249,4.555555555555555
4842195,5,B005N4DQ8Q,"Excellent DVD, very enjoyable. I recommend it highly, brings back a lot of memories, stuff like the Redskins-Cowboys 1979 season finale. The bonus feature of the original ""NFL Game Of The Week"" production of the Sea Of Hands Dolphins-Raiders '74 playoff game makes this worth the purchase price almost by itself, classic. Get this video if you're a big NFL fan, no matter who your team is.",1330041600,15,389,4.82089552238806

If you are a die hard fan, you have seen all this before, either in real life or you saw it on TV as it happened.  Husband said,  ""120 minutes of boredom.""
