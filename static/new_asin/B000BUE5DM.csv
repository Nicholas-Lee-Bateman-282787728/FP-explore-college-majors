2441920,5,B000BUE5DM,"This is the Best Show I have ever seen.

Professional choreography, operator work, music just great!

Beautifully!

M.Flatley shows th world that he can do the greatest show in the world.

In the beginnig there was a little boringly, but a 5 minutes after - he capture you thru the end.

I more like the issue with flowers, very beautifull picture on big screen on the scene & interesting costume (not only in this number), and most of all - the final number, where dancers stay on line and begin to tap on accomponied rock gitar. Super!",1135468800,3,537,4.494845360824742
2441921,4,B000BUE5DM,"Obviously this show and Michael Flatley is worth 5 stars. The significant defect in this DVD is that the cameras are not focus on Michael Flatley when he is performing. Unlike Feet of Flames and Lord of the Dance----Camera always shown the true genius of Flatley by focusing on him when he is performing.

The often times of showing bankup dancers' feet when Flatley is dancing is most annoying. Otherwise, this show is worth watching over and over.",1135036800,6,449,4.756410256410256
2441922,5,B000BUE5DM,"I have been lucky enough to see Michael perform in person in LOTD as well as Feet of Flames.  I recently saw Celtic Tiger for the second time, at the Palace in Auburn Hills MI.  I had seen it about a month earlier in London Ont.  I felt that the Detroit area show was much improved over the London version. He is obviously polishing the production as the tour proceeds. I'll be interested to see what the DVD version contains compared to the two versions that I have seen on stage.

Celtic Tiger is very different from his previous shows but every bit as good.  Anyone who liked the earlier shows will will love Celtic Tiger.

I might also mention that I have seen Lord of the Dance performed by one of the touring companies.  It was very well done and I enjoyed it, however compared to the same show danced by Michael it paled.  Michael Flatley lights up a stage.  He has incredible talent as well as amazing stage presence.  If you have the opportunity,  see him before he retires for good.",1134086400,10,992,4.366120218579235
2441923,5,B000BUE5DM,"I saw ""Celtic Tiger"" on November 8th at the Target Center in Minneapolis, MN and I was blown away by the talent of these men and women that Michael finds for his shows. Michael was at his best; he did a fire dance that was hairy to watch, especially when you see his shoes smoking when he jumped off the little stage that he did his special tap dance on.

I was also happy to see my other violinist, Cora Smyth, who appeared with Mairead Nesbitt in ""Lord of the Dance"" and ""Feet of Flames"" She's with her sister, Breda, in ""Celtic Tiger"" and they were a wonder to watch.

The only drawback that I could find was the strip tease. I could not find any reason for it being part of the show. I also missed the Irish music. There wasn't enough of it!! But then that is what Mr. Flatley warned us about in his interviews; that this show would be different from his other shows.

Mr. Flatley did not appear onstage as much as I would of liked; but then that is what he does. He gets the show well known throughout the world, then he bows out and starts another project.

All in all, the show was sensational. Michael Flatley didn't disappoint!",1133222400,8,1136,4.24537037037037
2441924,3,B000BUE5DM,"First, I own the Flatley DVDs and have enjoyed all of them. Even more with repeated viewings. (Why isn't Riverdance with Michael on DVD yet?)

Second, I have seen several live Irish dancing productions and partook in some and played for some and and ______ and...(Commitments reference there - fill in the blank)

Third, I really looked forward to the show at the Garden in NYC.

The music is not there.  Riverdance holds your attention with the music. Hardiman's ""Lord of the Dance"" (LOTD) music is just as good, if not better, at holding your attention. ""Celtic Tiger"" (CT) had one, maybe two, numbers that pulled at my ear.

The dancing does include several different styles and is used for good effect. However, mulling over the show as I was leaving the Garden, I thought that ""LOTD"" would have made more sense as a place for various styles where ""CT"" being an Irish story should have featured a little more Irish dancing.

And it might be me but the final dance line with the machine-gun line stomp is getting old.  It appeared in Riverdance. It was featured more in ""LOTD"" and ""Feet of Flames"". It really feels like a ""been there-done that"" moment.

Then there is the stripper scene.  Very hard to watch with my mother-in-law sitting next to me.  Even my children were left wondering what that was all about.

You may enjoy this and there are moments of brilliance such as when ""Captain"" Flatley walks onstage but it left me feeling like this was a Work In Progress that needed about another 3 or 4 weeks to work out the rough spots.",1132704000,35,1540,4.583941605839416
2441925,5,B000BUE5DM,"We just had the privledge of seeing the performance of Celtic Tiger starring Michael Flatley in Phoenix, AZ.  It was absolutely terrific--the best show anyone could ever hope to see! Michael's dancing was superb, as usual, and his troupe was magnificent.  Music, choreography, solos, cinematics, and special effects were top of the line--absolutely brilliant.  Sell your horse, your teeth, your hair--whatever you have to do to attend this show! You won't be sorry!",1131235200,11,465,5.342465753424658
2441926,5,B000BUE5DM,"I was very lucky to see this show twice: first I won a ticket to watch the recording of the DVD in Birmingham and, next thing I knew, I was on a plane to see the Madison Square Garden performance. It's absolutely brilliant and Michael is dancing even better, if that is at all possible. If you happen to know a little about Irish history, it'll help you understand. If you don't, it's pure, first class entertainment.",1130630400,13,417,4.428571428571429
2441927,5,B000BUE5DM,"I saw this show live at the Anaheim Pond, and it was spectacular! I had already seen Riverdance at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and I saw Feet Of Flames in Las Vegas. I think this show was as good as the other two. The primary difference was Michael Flatley did less dancing in this show (when he did dance he was superb). It surprised me when Michael picked up a flute and played a beautiful solo. He did a very good job I might add.

This show was not the same as the previously mentioned shows in that this show did not focus primarily on the Irish dancing. There were other styles of dancing (modern, tap, and ballet) in Celtic Tiger that weaved a story about the history of Ireland and the Irish people who came to America. I will agree with the other reviewer that there were some patriotic moments (regarding Ireland and America) that were really good. The finale spotlighted the song ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" that was written by George M. Cohan, who was a famous Irish American. What a wonderful way to end a wonderful show.

I cannot wait to get my DVD. I loved the show and I am sure that I will love the DVD. I was surprised that they were not selling the DVD at the show.

But no worries... as usual Amazon has the goods!",1130544000,55,1250,4.288135593220339
2441928,5,B000BUE5DM,"Our local TV station, WQED just showed this performance because Flatley is coming to PITTSBURGH in November!!  He's STILL got it, folks!  The same energy, the same passion, the same surprises.  I was concerned because it's been a while since we've heard from him.  Time has NOT taken any talent from the man!  If nothing else, he's MORE creative, and MORE energetic than ever.  He's added some ROCK, some PATRIOTIC stuff, and that's all I'm saying so it won't be ruined.  Michael Flatley fans will LOVE THIS!  Can't wait for the release of the DVD.",1130198400,11,548,4.6947368421052635

It is basically the story of Ireland, from the druids and the Saint Patrick story to the eventual immigration to America of many Irish citizens.  This dvd also includes a few extras, such as rehearsal footage and interviews with the cast, which is always fun to me.  Michael Flatley never disappoints, and I love that he always acknowledges the whole cast.  As I recall, in the live show there was a video roll call of influential Irish - Americans that I did miss, but all in all, a great dvd!",1429574400,,670,4.328

It's a great dvd, and we like it just as well as Lord of the Dance. It's got one scene in it however that I have to skip for my sons and that's the part where the lady strips down to her bikini. But other than that, it's a great show of very skilled dancers and great music. Michael Flatley playing the flute was a real treat too.",1394150400,,446,3.966666666666667
2441998,5,B000BUE5DM,"First loved Michael Flatley when I watched him in Riverdance. Ever since then, I have searched high and low for other productions he is either in or produced. Was happy when I found Celtic Tiger, and another one called Feet of Flames. Anyhoo, in Celtic Tiger, Michael Flatley performs and is the Director/Producer. First off, I love watching the Irish dances, how in sync they are, very impressive. In person, the tickets are outrageously priced. On DVD, I can watch repeatedly, for one low price! That is entertainment to me, and my frugal budget. This production, he takes us on a journey from early Ireland times, Vikings, Irish vs British soldiers, and on to America. His performances always includes at least 2 encores from the audience. It's a very thought out story, that has high energy dance choreography To try it out, check out You Tube, I am sure there are bits of performances on there to give you a taste of what to expect. For me, personally, the price was well worth it. I have watched it dozens of times, and when nothing else is on to watch, I will pull out one of his shows, and though I know the storyline, I never get tired of watching him and his fellow dancers do their thing!",1392768000,,1199,4.529953917050691

2442011,1,B000BUE5DM,"I just HATE to do this as I just LOVE Michael Flatley - ego and all.  He's brought me so much joy over the years and I was really hoping this would be a new thing to love.

It is just AWFUL on all levels: choreography, music, costumes.  Horrible.  I've always wished he had more than one show in him, but, bless him, he doesn't.  This is just a minor re-working of LOTD and FOF.

If you don't believe me, please rent it first, or watch some of it on youtube.  Embarrassingly and sadly awful.  In order to save someone else from buying, I threw it away.

Then I watched LOTD again to clear away the drivel and remind myself why he's one of my hero's!",1386028800,,649,4.087301587301587

2442014,5,B000BUE5DM,Telling the history of Ireland and Irish culture in the world from beginning to present day through interpretive dance and Irish dance is quite the concept. Flatley and company in this show do just that and succeed!,1364860800,,215,4.837837837837838
2442015,5,B000BUE5DM,"Yes this is a lot different than LOTD was and it was SUPPOSED TO BE!!! I would have been livid if I had paid 20 bucks for something very similar to LOTD. I was expecting something different and that is what I got. Michael uses different types of dance to tell this story of the history of the Irish. It can be hard to follow at some points if you don't know anything about Irish History (luckily I do) but in my opinion the dancing is wonderful. Yes, the striptease bit was a little unique to say the least but to each their own. Is this as good as LOTD? No. Is it a great show that deserves praise? Absolutely. If you're looking for something along the lines of LOTD, this is not for you. If you are looking for a different Michael Flatley show, by all means buy this and enjoy.",1355097600,,779,4.131578947368421
2442016,3,B000BUE5DM,"Flatley is a superb dancer and talented choreographer with a fine sense of rhythmic timing. At 54 years of age he still dances at dazzling speed and clearly has retained his star power.  The first part of the show was lovely and in keeping with the spirit of his previous shows. Also, I really enjoyed hearing Michael play the flute again.  However, it all went to potty beginning with the bit of the Irish immigration to America ~ so totally off base as to be laughable.  Uh, they didn't come in JETS geesh!  Was the gangster sequence a nod to the Irish gangs of NYC?  If so, why the Capone look? I don't need to ask what was on his mind with the foolish stripper sequence or with her prancing about miming playing a piccalo for Yankee Doodle Dandy but really, how dumb was that? Luckily the show got back to more of the troup dancing toward the end.  I will give high-fives to all the youngsters and their tremendous hard work!  Just watching them is energizing.",1353110400,,964,4.4124293785310735
2442017,2,B000BUE5DM,"I LOVE Riverdance. I grew up with it. I listen to the music. I'd give it 5 stars easily. But this...This is not Riverdance. I liked most of Lord of the Dance. Feet of Flames was ok. But this was terrible. I literally cringed at the USA themed dance. Where those cheerleader outfits?

What the what was with the stewardess dancing in high heels? Was that supposed to be taken seriously? Where do I even begin with the striptease??? Good Lord it was tacky. There were several moments where I just burst out laughing.

Also, the entire show had an enormous background screen that involved terrible things like jets, sports, blindingly bright flowers blooming, and snakes. People dressed up as animals, flowers, and butterflies and did boring dances that would be appropriate for a 2nd grade talent show. I think much of the audience must have been drunk to have cheered as much as they did.

Much of the music was not recognizably different than Flatley's past shows. The only redeeming points of this that I truly enjoyed were the first dance, which was gladiator themed, seeing men dressed in British military dress with white wigs ""Riverdancing,"" and the jazzy gangster scene. Those moments were enjoyable and up to par with the past shows. Everything else was laughable, cheesy, and highly unlike the original and far superior Riverdance. I couldn't take this show seriously. Don't pay money to watch this.

P.S. He's too old to go on stage without a shirt.......",1346371200,,1464,4.820717131474104
2442018,5,B000BUE5DM,"I became hooked on Michael Flatley and Irish Dancing after seeing a performance of Riverdance on TV.  Next I purchased the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Michael-Flatley-Collection-Lord-of-the-Dance-Feet-of-Flames-Michael-Flatley-Gold/dp/B0001FVDQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Michael Flatley Collection (Lord of the Dance/Feet of Flames/Michael Flatley Gold)</a>&nbsp;and enjoyed each performance more than the last.  At the time there were no DVD's of Celtic Tiger available but I learned the show was coming to Reno, NV, where I lived at the time.

Seeing the live performance of Celtic Tiger from the center of the 12th row left myself and my guests nearly speachless.  The dancing and the storyline were flawlessly inter-woven.  The feet of the dancers were nearly a blur as they tapped their way through the story.  Each time Michael appeared on stage his energy and fabulous performance electrified the audience bringing us to a higher level of excitement.  The abslute highlight was the finale and 2 encores of Yankee Doodle Dandy which brought tears to my eyes as the feeling of patriotism flowed through the audience.

The dvd of Celtic Tiger was released several months after the live performance that I was priveledged to view.  Watching the DVD allows me to re-live one of the high points of my life; the live performance of Celtic Tiger.  While the filmography is excellent nothing can compare to actually being there although the DVD does come close.  Highly Recommended!

I've read other reviewers comments that they do not believe Celtic Tiger is Michael's best work.  I disagree.  Celtic Tiger was an evolution bringing together the best of dance, showmanship, and choreography into a breathtaking performance.  Change is inevitable and without it comes stagnation.  However everone has a right to their own opinion.  To me, Celtic Tiger will always remain the highlight of Michael's danceing career.",1322956800,,1973,5.7020547945205475

Michael Flately has done it again.

 This movie was a treat for both the eyes and ears. The music was awesome and the dancing superb. It tells the story of Michael's own life through dance. Starting with the vikings and working to the present. The first side of the dvd shows Ireland and it's history to the present including The british invasion and Black Sunday. Side two is more americanized with the arrival of Michael's family to the United States!

2442036,2,B000BUE5DM,"I have studied Michael Flatley's other dance videos, and this one is simply not as uplifting as Feet of Flames. All of Flatley's dance videos have video switching on speed dial, some worse than others. For someone in complete awe of Irish music and dance, I want to study what the dancers are doing for more than 3/4 second. This is not the worst of the bunch; that prize goes to the original Lord of the Dance video; a sore sight for the eyes.
I have to admit to a fascination with Irish culture, especially the music. Feet of Flames was uplifting like no other video I have ever seen, bar none (but not because of the video treatment). By contrast, the opening sequence of The Celtic Tiger frustrated me. Why can't we see the dancers? All we can see are strobe lights.
But where The Celtic Tiger really fails is that the nationalistic tone is simply not as uplifting as Flatley's earlier work. I believe the purer the Irish music and dance, the better. The hymn to Irish independence might have caused the powers that be to shut down The Celtic Tiger, if the show had not failed on its own merits. (Imagine if someone had produced an American musical with the theme ""the South will rise again."") The pilots dancing number was cute until it became a striptease sequence. Ouch! The burning of Irish homes may have been factually accurate, but was still not uplifting; it was painful to watch.
Michael, please honor the tradition of Irish music and dance. Produce a video that lavishes attention on the dancers and musicians. Make a video that is Irish music and dance performance first, and a video event second. You may have to fight some video directors to get a product that is top quality, but you've shown the focus that's needed in a wide variety of performance disciplines. Rise above nationalism and stick to uplifting Irish music and dance.",1209945600,,1849,4.606060606060606

If you like Irish Dance and Excitement this DVD is a must purchase. It is absolutely fantastic and non stop dancing, singing and a good story line of the history of the Irish struggles and the Irish making it in America. It is a sexy show for sure and a lot of beautiful people, costumes and props. Very exciting, I would say. My daughter has been an Irish dancer for many years and the dancing in this DVD is just spectacular. There is a scene where a young lady flies over from Ireland and she changes in America and it is symbolized by her doing a striptease down to a patriotic two piece bathing suit. Any red blooded man would find it very exiting. It is clear that Michael did not want to hamper what he wanted to do with the show by making it fully for kids. He aims it at an adult audience. I would let any of my kids see it however. If the one scene bothers someone a little they can fast forward it. This show is pure excitement. It is very stylish and sexy at times. If I had a teenage daughter, I would let her see it and I am sure teens see a lot more than this on MTV. Great traditional songs such as Four green fields, A Nation Once Again, Wearing of the Green (I think?)  and several others. Don't listen to any critics buy it and judge for yourself. I almost did not buy it due to some critics I read. I understood the story line her better than any of the other shows Riverdance etc. The dancing was just incredible and the grand finale was mind boggling good and the grandest of any of them.

2442051,1,B000BUE5DM,"Michael, Michael, Michael -- what in the hell went wrong with you when you decided to put a show like this together?. I can understand the idea of bringing in new dance forms for experimentation purposes. But the product that came out from this vision was absolutley ridiculous. For one I don't think it says much for ""lady liberty"" to do a strip tease and for two for Ireland to become the ""celtic kitten"". With 100% emphasis on sexuality -- this show is 100% horrible. I would never suggest this on anyone. And I think that Michael Flatley should hang up the shoes now and let a new handsome idiot take his place. In conclusion -- this show annoyed the hell out of me and I cannot believe that he even produced such a product.",1183680000,7,728,4.4

2442053,5,B000BUE5DM,"I can't agree with all the knockers rubbishing Celtic Tiger.  I purchased my DVD from Amazon in March, and sat down to watch it without any prior knowledge of what it would be like.  I thought it was brilliant - the music by Ronan Hardiman is amazing and just gets better each time, and Michael Flatley was his usual talented and charismatic self.  He was 47 years old when he did that show so that's why he didn't dance all the time.  I have since watched this DVD about four or five times and each time I enjoy it more.  I just loved the Viking music with the boats and contrary to other people's opinions, I thought the strip scene was very colourful.  I thought it was great when Michael came on with the other pilots to greet the 'stewardess'and looked over the top of his sunglasses. It was a bit of fun, showing the contrast to the old Ireland and then the new life in the USA.  The Redcoats scene was very moving, especially when it showed the poor people being cast out of their homes.  The big screen with all the images was very well done.  Nobody's mentioned the flute played by Michael during that beautiful dance scene.  People can't expect this show to be another LOTD or Feet of Flames.  I loved every one of Michael's creations and I say - well done, Michael (dancer and choreographer) and well done, Ronan (composer).",1181001600,,1335,4.408163265306122
2442054,1,B000BUE5DM,"Overly glitzy show that actually has very little to do with the history of the Irish nation.  The musical numbers start off promisingly enough, but soon become overly long, deviating from the main concept of telling a story.  There are stripteases, mediocre soloists, bikini clad women, bump and grinds, lot's of fire, smoke and glitz, glitz, glitz.  Add that to Michael Flatley's ever growing ego, (and, my, does he enjoy displaying it onstage)and you have a very superficial hour and a half of rubbish.",1180828800,11,504,4.976190476190476

2442057,1,B000BUE5DM,"Finally purchased my copy of Celtic Tiger and looking forward to watching it as I have his other shows.  I kept waiting for the magic to start like it did from the very beginning of River dance or the entrance of the hooded dancers at the start of LOTD, but it never appeared.  It's not a DVD I'll watch over and over (if ever again) and if I had seen it before buying it, I would not have purchased it at all.

There is less focus on dancing (which is what I want to see when I see a Michael Flatley production - silly me, I guess) and what the heck was the striptease about??? In an audience with lots of children??? Not impressed at all.  The solo talent didn't seem up to par with what he has brought us in the past.  And like someone else mentioned all the different camera shots made it impossible to really focus on anything. There was no real focus on the dance troup itself.  I'd be hard pressed to pick out one of the troup after watching the DVD, unlike the others when there was a face to go with those feet.  Or perhaps that was the whole idea behind Mr. Flatley's decisions on this production.

I doubt that I'll buy a fifth production if Michael Flatley doesn't go back to his roots and focus once more on the great Irish dancing and music out there. It seems he hit his peak with LOTD, which is a shame.

Definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone who enjoys the dancing and music of LOTD and looking for a repeat.",1169337600,21,1431,4.193430656934306
2442068,3,B000BUE5DM,"There are a few good sequences, but overall it is nothing like Riverdance or Lord of the Dance. The filming of the show is especially annoying.

2442070,3,B000BUE5DM,"I enjoy Mr. Flatley, I admire his work, since he appeared with the Chieftains. He is still one of the greatest entertainers of this time. However Celtic Tiger is not t a great show. I agree 100% with JJ and John Morgan commentaries. The entire concept is a great idea, but similar shows have been done. I own a copy of ""Waves"" in which you see a family go through the famine times. It is a modest production but very enjoyable music and dancing (Tommy Makem appears in this show). It ends with the family in the USA with a great american-irish dance.
Now back to Celtic Tiger. I saw Michael live in the original Lord of the Dance, right before he left Riverdance and before LOTD separated into several troops around the world. THAT SHOW WAS AWESOME. I saw Riverdance, live, and even without Flatley or Jean Butler, I liked this show a lot. Then I bought the DVD Feet of Flames, GREAT! Later I bought the DVD Michael Flatley's GOLD, a definitely keeper.
But then I saw Celtic Tiger on DVD... I don't know if the live show had as much a cappella at the beginning as the DVD, if it did, it was too long. The Garden of Eden could have been enjoyable if it had been performed by little girls, since it didn't have the formality degree the Swan Lake has. I enjoyed ""St Patrick"". The Vikings part had a good intention. The first part of the show was good. I did love anything that had a visual representation of the famine. The Red Coats dance was very good, and the Bloody Sunday and 1916 rising were just awesome. On the second part, Celtic Kittens, were like Webber's CATS without the makeup. The international routines, including ballet, were not amateur, but not very professional either, maybe I have been watching too much ""So You Think You Can Dance"". They were not very original or authentic either. The flight attendant stripper was entirely unnecessary, unless I missed the point. The cheerleaders dance was pointless and simple. I did like the gangsters dancing, but it reminded me of the taps in ""Will Rogers Follies"".  Flatley's solos are great, but nothing new. In all, the second part felt like a 4th of July celebration. I thought: they were doing this in Budapest? The ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" kept on going forever. The music didn't do much for me either, but good and pretty fiddlers made it better. I will not go to see this show live unless I get free tickets. That's why I am glad I saw this DVD.",1155427200,8,2409,4.475

The choreography is dated and poor in many instances. In one case the dance reminded me of nothing more than Pan's People and in another, a garden scene with insects etc. it looked like a Joyce Grenfell Nursery school where the children had been told to ""pretend that you are an insect"". Added to the poor choregraphy is a political statement that has no place in what is supposed to be an evening of light entertainment and an overall concept that is bewildering in its lack of cohesion.

Although we thoroughly enjoyed Lord of the Dance, Celtic Tiger is truly as extravaganza!!!  The special effects are magnifigent!!!!!! It contained a greater, more meaningful story line that gives a warm insight into Irish families who migrated to America and takes you through the time in America when they arrived.  The costumes are certainly more elaborate and diversified, and the dancing is superb--more versatile and fluid.  The music--fantastic!

I felt exuberated after watching this show, proud to be of Irish heritage and always proud of be an American.

It's a wonderful show in spots, and not-so-great in others. The strip-tease scene should have been left out altogether, it was tacky and unnecessary...and the scene right before it with the stewardess and the airline pilots was slow. The music was wonderful for that part, but the choreography was just boring and didn't add to the story, in my opinion. Plus, what was with the orgasmic tigresses during that wonderful violin quartet music?? Other than a few spots like those, Celtic Tiger is very entertaining. I loved the ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" number at the end. It's always distracting to me when the crowd is screaming so loud that you can't hear the music or the taps, but that's just part of a live show that you can't help, I guess.

He is notorious for breaking rules and pushing limits.  Yet you can take Irish dancing only so far.  Mr. Flatley's work in ""The Celtic Tiger"" is anything but Irish dancing.  In fact, it hasn't been Irish dancing for a while.  I keep thinking of that scene in the Budapest version of ""Feet of Flame"", where Cleopatra (former Morrigan) performs a delightful little strip tease to the sounds of flamenco.

I would have given the DVD an unquestionable 5, except for several minor issues. Having viewed his incredible ""Feet of Flames"", this show falls just slightly below Feet of Flames, as that was one unsurpassable achievement by anyone, Michael Flately himself included. Also, there is just a little too much similarities between ""Feet of Flames"" and ""Celtic Tiger"" - several of the dance and compositions are nearly identical. At last, the show is a little bit too much ""Las Vegas"" than the genuine Irish dance show I was expecting... a few dance numbers stood out as ""out of place"".

Now I understand why Riverdance has changed and changed for the worse.  They are trying to compete with this kind of thing.  And they shouldn't!

The reason I even have this DVD is that my co-workers. Goddess bless' em, who all know how much I love RD, figured I'd like Celtic Tiger, but...they were wrong!

This has to be one of the tackiest things I've ever seen.  What the heck the strip number was about is quite puzzling and oh, how very much it adds to this WONDERFUL show to see her prancing around in her tacky looking bikini which resembles the trashy costumes for the Yankee Doodle Dandy number!

Can we say BAD TASTE!!!  And just like in his other show LOTD, the music is so-so.

Now, there is no denying the immense talent of Michael Flatley, but since he's left Riverdance, he has taken his ability and succumbed to the lure of the almighty dollar, thereby taking his gifts and surrounding them with a huge amount of needless hype that only detracts from his talent, just like another truly talented performer I mentioned  above, Elvis Presly.

Shame on you Michael Flatley!  You can do better!

Comments about specific parts of the show:  The start was interesting, but from the scene called Garden Of Eden, which was INCREDIBLY boring and vapid, onward the show got worse and worse!
