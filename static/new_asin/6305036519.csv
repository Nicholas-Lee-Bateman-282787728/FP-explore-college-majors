953062,5,6305036519,"The phrase ""no,no,no,no"" will never mean the same to you again in this very British comedy.  It is full of the usual self-depreciation that makes British comedy so funny, and gives the viewer some well defined  odd characters to look forward to in each episode. It is a welcome addition  to your comedy library.",916876800,3,311,4.722222222222222
953250,5,6305036519,"One of the very best British comedy series' in years with it being written by two highly accomplished and renowned writers, Richard Curtis (who enjoyed tremendous success with BLACKADDER) and Paul Mayhew-Archer. Dawn French, one of Britains very finest comidienne's, sparkles as the first lady vicar of the quiet, countryside village of Dibley. The astounding dialogue flows brilliantly with it bubbling with witty repartee and razor sharp wit. Its complimented by superb  support performances with most notably Emma Chambers as the dizzy and scatterbrained, Alice. Both Dawn French and Emma Chambers sparkle together as a duo but really the ultimate star of the show is Dawn French who without a doubt wiill have you in total hysterics. The comic timing and delivery is masterminded perfectly by everyone involved and every episode on this video is a classic. The first episode is particularly funny with Dawn French's superb performance. The opening episode really set the tone for the rest of the series. A fine British comedy classic! Highly recommended!",991958400,17,1058,5.2976190476190474
953251,5,6305036519,"Following a vote in the 90s allowing female vicars in the Church of England, Dawn French latched on to an unlikely, if topical, idea: there's comic gold in them there pews.  An odd notion, indeed, for a woman who'd been partly responsible for penning the most decadent comedy in the 90's: ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  Yet the idea equally intrigued Richard Curtis--best known for being a creative force behind BLACK ADDER, A THIN BLUE LINE, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, and NOTTING HILL--and together they created one of Britain's best, most trans-Atlantically understandable series.
What makes it so good is that it manages to make familiar that which most people never see: the personal life of their local religious leader.  It's all about the intersection of humanity with religion and the ways in which a Reverend, unafraid to admit her foibles, nevertheless leads her flock and community.
More than that, it's a comedy which takes the best elements from previous series Richard Curtis and Dawn French worked on, and improves them.  Chief among these legacies is the relationship between the two leads.  French's Vicar Geraldine and her friend, Alice, are in many ways like Curtis' Black Adder and Baldric.  Geraldine is just a wee bit smarter than Alice, and, as with Black Adder and Baldric, much humor is derived from watching explanations of the obvious unfold.  Yet the relationship is nowhere near as harsh as the delightfully abusive one in BLACK ADDER.  It's as if French's Patsy and Edina have rubbed off on Geraldine and Alice.  In AB FAB, Patsy and Edina kept each other in line, and here, too, Alice occasionally rescues Geraldine from herself.  Like Patsy and Edina, Alice and Geraldine are friends who genuinely need each other--not the sort of master and servant that are Black Adder and Baldric.  Plus, Emma Chamber's Alice may be dim at times, but she doesn't know it.  Hers is a blissful ignorance, as if she's looking at the world through glasses that make her vision of the world seem perfectly focussed.  More often than not, she's also the moral voice of the show--the conscience of her vicar.  In short, the buddy formula that both French and Curtis have used before to great effect has settles here into the form of affectionate, genuine friendship.
This first tape introduces us to these latter day buddies, along with the other characters who inhabit Dibley.  Though the show definitely hits its stride in later episodes, this first tape is indispensible for getting properly oriented to Dibley's inhabitants.",974246400,16,2533,4.997619047619048
953252,5,6305036519,"After being amused by english sitcoms that Dawn has worked on like  ""French and Saunders"" and ""ABFAB"" it is really  wonderful to find one that leaves me rolling around on the floor in tears.  I am addicted to this series now. While it has some site gags and some very  base humor it also has some seriously subtle humor as well. What is really  nice about this series is the humor is guilt free. It lacks some of cruelty  that is in Abfab, and has a kind compassionate spin! Really fresh and fun!  Dawn French is awesome!!",965865600,11,522,4.319587628865979
953253,5,6305036519,"Dawn French, one of the British long time treasures, has found her way  into the series so appropiately named ""The Vicar of Dibley"".  There are realitively few episodes of this series compared to U.S.  television standards, but each episode is a gem.
Dawn filmed most of  these episoes a few years ago, and recently the BBC America channel had her  4 new hour long shows, each named after the season of the year (Summer,  Spring....) that the show addresses.  These 4 new shows follow Dawn and her  zany villager paritioners through a complete year in the village (in TV  land).
I strongly recommend buying this episode and any others you can  get your hands on.  You won't be disappointed.  Television at its best,  made possible by the wife of another British TV star, Lenny Henery of CHEF  fame.  Dawn and Lenny have been married(hope they are still together) for s  number of years.",964656000,4,886,4.69281045751634

953255,5,6305036519,"I have bought all four of the ""Vicar"" tapes, but shall only comment on the first, because the rest is much of the same: some of the greatest comedy you're ever likely to see. Seldomn have creators of a TV  series succeeded in assembling such a marvelous collection of odd-balls.  Every character is intersting and hilarious. There is never, never a dull  moment. Dawn French is superbly funny as the Vicar, but her thunder is all  but obliterated by the extraordinary comic talents of Emma Chambers as  Alice and James Fleet as Hugo. I have watched the videos at least ten times  and still giggle myself to a stand-still every time.",951091200,6,632,4.648648648648648

7881222,5,6305036519,"Dawn French as the Vicar of Dibley is truly gifted.  This television series from England is one of the funniest ever to hit any shore.
When the ancient vicar of the tiny hamlet of Dibley dies on the pulpit, the archbishop sends a new vicar to the tiny village:  none other than Dawn French playing Geraldine, or Gerri.  While this might seem innocuous in this modern age, such modern thoughts are not necessarily present in this small town.  Confrontation is imminent - to a hilarious degree.
The cast includes: David, the head of the town council (and a wealthy, pompous bore); David's adult son, Hugo, a Kylie Minogue fanatic, and borderline idiot;  Frank, the dim bulb council secretary; Letitia, the aged council member, a self-proclaimed innovative cook (devils food cake with coffee and ketchup icing, anyone?); Owen, the curmudgeondy farmer, who always seems to have some sort of digestion troubles; Alice, the moronic verger and best friend to Gerri; and finally, no no no no no no no, yes, Jim, the befuddled excentric council member.
Most of the episodes deal with the council and their lives, but occasionally they deal with a bit broader subject matter.  Either way, this show cannot be beat for hilarity!
And after the credits roll, do NOT miss the dialogue between Gerri and Alice - each week Gerri tells the mutton headed Alice a joke which she undoubtedly doesn't understand.
Don't miss this one!",1032393600,9,1412,4.887029288702929
7881223,5,6305036519,"I first saw the first episode of The Vicar of Dibley last year while high above the Atlantic on British Airways--I don't think I've ever laughed as much, especially at 35,000 feet. I immediately went out and rented all the episodes I could find, and later bought them for my home video library. I love 'em all...The sarcasm of village squire David, the beyond-dim dimwittedness of Alice and Hugo, and, above all, the incredible comic talents of Dawn French. If you've ever seen her in Saunders and French, you'll know how terrific she is--but as the Reverend Geraldine, she's blessed with the time and the room to develop her character and work with a fine ensemble cast. What clinches it, for me, is the sincerity and tenderness with which Ms. French acts in the sadder emotional moments in the series--how many actors do you know who can go from the broadest of physical comedy to the gut-wrenching quiet of a deathbed scene with utter believability? Ms. French is fabulous, and I only wish that there were another six or eight Vicar of Dibley videos to buy. Absolutely not to be missed.",1027900800,12,1089,4.706806282722513

7881228,5,6305036519,"Over the years, many comedies have been compared to the classic Fawlty Towers. Never has that comparison been more justified than with The Vicar of Dibley. Without a doubt, this delightful comedy, co-written by Richard Curtis (who also co-wrote Mr. Bean and The Black Adder), is one of the most hilarious British comedies around. Set in the quaint, picturesque village of Dibley, this is the first video in the series. It contains three 30-minute episodes, and for newcomers, this is definitely the video with which to start.
Headed by the extremely talented Dawn French, who plays the witty and intelligent new vicar, Geraldine Granger, this series has one of the funniest casts of characters. Firstly, there is arrogant David Horton, whose role as the vicar's nemesis is established in the first episode when he objects to having a female vicar and attempts to have her replaced. Then there is the vicar's assistant, Alice Tinker, whose childlike naivete is the source of some of the most hilarious moments on the video. One must not forget Jim, who is incapable of uttering a sentence without preceding it by a half dozen ""No's"". Needless to say, he's certainly not the obvious choice to direct parking at the village fair! Then there is Frank, whose highly selective minute-taking at council meetings results in some extremely funny minutes being recorded. Rounding out this motley cast are David's goofy son Hugo, who rather fancies Alice but hasn't a clue what to do about it; farmer Owen, with his dodgy bowels and farmyard anecdotes of questionable taste; and finally Letitia, whose highly original culinary creations are the source of much discomfort and indigestion.
In conclusion, the humour in this delightful series is plentiful and, quite honestly, side-splittingly funny, but without ever being scathing. It is truly a classic and is extremely highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the very best that British comedy has to offer. This is one series that is a joy to watch over and over again!",1000080000,8,2009,5.036036036036036
7881229,5,6305036519,"The Vicar of Dibley is yet another comic offering from writer Richard Curtis (known for the movies 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Notting Hill', and 'Bean' as well as the BBC series 'Blackadder'.)  Starring Dawn French as the new female vicar of a tiny village with only six parishioners, this tape contains the first three episodes (30 minutes each) from the first season.
The first episode, 'Arrival', introduces the characters and the village of Dibley. After the longtime vicar dies, the town learns that a new one is being sent to replace him. The verger, Alice (Emma Chambers), gets to keep her job, but the new vicar, Geraldine, (Dawn French) has to fight for hers when Village Councillor David Horton (Gary Waldhorn) objects to the presence of a female vicar.
The second episode, 'Songs of Praise', sees Dibley selected to appear on a television program filmed each week in a different church. For United States viewers, some of the references in this episode may be a bit obscure. Nevertheless, the end of this episode features Alice and Geraldine in one of the funniest sequences I've ever witnessed on television. This is NOT to be missed.
The final episode is entitled 'Community Spirit'. Geraldine recruits Elton John to open the village's Autumn Faire after learning that he is Emma's cousin. I won't give away the ending, but the video's box cover says that this year's faire ""could be the most memorable fete since 1987 -- when someone put cannabis in the cupcakes.""
In case you're thinking that comedy about religion can't possibly be funny, let me reassure you that Dawn French's vicar downs liquor and chases men as often as she can. This isn't a tame series -- in fact, these people say things that American network television standards would never allow. The other characters in the village are also hilarious, especially Owen Newitt (played by Roger Lloyd Pack), the strange farmer. I can't recommend this series enough.",998092800,22,1943,4.941896024464832
