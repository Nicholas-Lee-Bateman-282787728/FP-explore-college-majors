8675358,5,B00MYQOQA8,"This DVDs the bomb. The music is awesome, of course, but to see the artists as they appeared on 60s television makes this extra fun. I saw this on PBS years ago and tried for years to find it. This is a real gem - it could be the centerpiece of a sixties - themed party. Well worth the money.",1524528000,,292,3.8833333333333333

8675360,5,B00MYQOQA8,"Very very beautiful. Some of the loveliest music we will ever have the privilege to experience.
Great classics all and very well restored performances. Sweet and so enjoyable.
This is a loving tribute for the work of Hal David and Burt Bacharach and the best one to date. Tremendous historical value.
I first saw this program on PBS a year or two ago and was stunned by the beauty and the overwhelming talent of all the artists.
The main reason I purchased this was for the performances of The Carpenters and the incomparable Dusty Springfield. Her rendition of The Look Of Love here is truly breathtaking and it is the original full length version, not the shorter 2 minute one on so many other Springfield video collections.
But all the artists featured give excellent performances. All are well photo graphed and directed and are original period pieces.
I believe you have to make a $150 donation during a PBS pledge drive to get this disc. Sad. They should offer it always for $20 - $25 so more can enjoy it.
As much as I love this I am frustrated by the lack of a chapter menu. There are a total of 22 and you just have to scroll your way through them as you watch. Very inconsiderate.
I would also prefer more audio options instead of just Dolby stereo 2.0.
All live video here has been filtered or softened to appear more film like, a practice I find curious (dubious?) but fairly common.

Overall I rate this release 5 stars for Quality of Content, 1 star for Design and Execution for no chapter menu and no audio options.
Not perfect but exceptionally worthwhile.",1481846400,,1572,4.554770318021202

8675364,5,B00MYQOQA8,"The only thing that will irritate you about this DVD is that it isn't 200 hours in length. It's the fastest one+ hour you've ever experienced watching the tube.

Hosted by Robert Wagner, this PBS special starts out with the best sung and choreographed music video Dionne Warwick ever made.

You're thinking: It can't get any better than this. But it's Burt Bacharach music...it always gets better. Here is a list of all the songs:

Walk On By, Dionne Warwick
I Say A Little Prayer, Dionne Warwick
Any Day Now, Chuck Jackson
What's New Pussycat, Tom Jones
The Look Of Love, Dusty Springfield
This Guy's In Love With You, Herb Alpert
This Girl's In Love With You, Dionne Warwick
Alfie, Dionne Warwick
Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, B.J. Thomas (Ed Sullivan)
One Less Bell To Answer, The Fifth Dimension
What the World Needs Now Is Love, Jackie DeShannon
(They Long To Be) Close To You, Carpenters
A House Is Not A Home, Dusty Springfield & Burt Bacharach
Arthur's Theme, Christopher Cross, Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager
That's What Friends Are For, Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight, Stevie Wonder

And later, a delightful:

I'll Never Fall In Love Again, Dionne Warwick and Glen Campbell

We are constantly teased with snippets of video from Burt's 1960s and early 1970s TV specials, which were irresistibly good...and never commercially released for home viewing.

The show is dedicated to the memory of Hal David

The main show is 56 minutes in length. It's followed by a documentary featuring Burt Bacharach, Hal David, and Dionne Warwick in the recording studio, 1967. Assorted clips and interviews follow, including Dionne, Jackie, and B.J. That adds another 12 minutes to the DVD.

Superb.",1430611200,10,1711,4.954545454545454
