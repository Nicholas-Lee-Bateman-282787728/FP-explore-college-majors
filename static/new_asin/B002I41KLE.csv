3935522,2,B002I41KLE,"When you hear the words Global Warming so many times at the beginning...i
thing that a special group paid for this film.  The film is pretty good
for what it is,,, but seems to be missing important elements...like more
effects...more gore...bigger creatures...etc...etc.
  Some of the special effects shots where the creatures are shown...you have
to look twice...as they are soo small...
  They also put the weight of the ending on the back of a young rooky film
star that i don't even know...that too took away a bit of the film.

  So its a good film for what it is...but something is missing and the film
ends up paying for it..... I like Val Kilmer...but in here...its only for
a paycheck...and he looks overfeed.",1257206400,3,718,4.733870967741935
3935523,5,B002I41KLE,"This is one creepy movie!  Set in a desolate Canadian landscape, THE THAW is a warning about global warming and how it might just affect mankind.  An eco-research team led by a dauntless Val Kilmer uncover a thawed mammoth that is host to a virulent vertebral parasite that quickly devours its hosts.  Enter three students and Kilmer's daughter and let the ""fun"" begin.  The bugs which look like big earwigs soon start their attack and it's relentlessly disturbing.
This is a pretty dark movie featuring tight direction and good performances.  A good horror flick.",1257120000,19,564,4.957446808510638
3935524,1,B002I41KLE,"OMG this was such a bad political movie. Man is responsible for killing the planet so he deserves to die by roach infestation. This was the theme of this movie.

3935525,4,B002I41KLE,"This movie was quite a satisfying 'isolation / paranoia / suspense / gore' movie! It's not a classic but it is very well done and should meet (and in some cases exceed) viewers' expectations. Inevitable comparisons to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' will arise (and indeed the initial setup is similar to 'The Thing'), but hopefully people won't attack this film because of that, as that wouldn't be entirely fair. The movie plays out differently than 'The Thing' and some of the sequences are truly unnerving in their own right. There is a major 'squirm' factor that permeates the movie with the parasites really 'getting under your skin' during some of the more disturbing infestation shots. It remains sufficiently suspenseful and unpredictable all the way to the satisfying conclusion. Val Kilmer is great as the obsessed scientist but he isn't in the movie very much, however this isn't a hinderance to the movie because the rest of the cast are quite capable themselves. The 'making of' documentary is entertaining and reveals many scenes that were apparently more difficult to shoot than they appeared in the film. Overall it was exactly the kind of movie I was expecting. Not a classic but very good and entertaining.",1255132800,40,1222,4.995098039215686
3935526,3,B002I41KLE,"The Ghost House Underground line of direct-to-DVD releases continues for a second year, only this time around we only get four films compared to last year's eight.  The most notable of which is The Thaw, which boasts some pretty decent production values and some chilling scares as well.  Martha MacIsaac (Superbad and The Last House on the Left) stars as the daughter of an environmental scientist (Val Kilmer) who accompanies a small group of students to a remote location where her father has discovered a well-preserved frozen woolly mammoth, and the parasitic bugs that lay dormant inside it as well.  Naturally, it isn't long before said bugs are on the loose and spreading.  Packed with gross-out moments and some brief shots of gorgeous cinematography, The Thaw is surprisingly good and definitely creepy.  It doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before in any random horror flick, but for what it's worth, The Thaw is worth a look.",1254787200,21,943,5.019230769230769

Otherwise your typical B dialogue/characters and half-baked pseudo-science.  Characters panic or turn on each other at the first sign of any problem, allowing the writing to remove common sense and any remnant of social skills from the equation.
The global warming debate is shoved in your face, despite the fact that the issue's causes and concerns have nothing to do with the movie aside from the critters originating in an ice melt.

Back in the 50's and 60's nukes were the culprits in many creature features today the alarmist's bell is ringing for climate change which is responsible for everything from acne to parasitic insects that infect and destroy. This is one of those. Val Kilmer, who is always good, plays a ecologist turned eco-terrorist and bugs are the vermin that are coming to destroy all life. If you are freaked-out by the creepy, crawlies then you will have a freaking good time. Very well done scenes of insect creepiness as they get under your skin and ultimately poke out of your eyes, nose and mouth after you are dead - very cool. The scene in which a guy gets his arm chopped off to avoid infection is particularly disturbing - and I mean that in a good way. Good movie.",1449532800,,794,4.520833333333333

Of course instead of an ALF causing all of the murder and mayhem, we have presented to us the end of the world thanks to a polar bear and an ancient parasite. This movie is totally offensive on so many fronts I haven't the space here. This is nothing but a platform for the ""climate change"" psychosis sweeping the planet. The ""hero"" Val Kilmer, is such a narcissistic sociopath with a god complex, he thinks nothing about spreading the parasite ""plague"" to the rest of the planet in order to reduce the world's population to ""acceptable"" levels and to hell with the common man. The sad truth is these psychotics really exist in today's world. I always wonder why they don't bravely show the rest of us ""non-believers"" the way by offing themselves first. Shame on Val Kilmer and his ilk who are god-less narcissists practicing their own brutal religion called ""evolution"" and woe to the rest of us who dare question their ""science"" so falsely called.",1448064000,,1012,4.659217877094972

The film, from minute one all the way to the credit crawl at the end, hits you over the head relentlessly with its simplistic (bordering on infantile) message about how man is destroying the planet via global warming. We are talking Birdemic levels of hamfistedness here.

Messaging aside, the film has the light beer drenched stench of Canada all over it, from the cheap sets and effects, to the terrible acting. Of note in particular is the female protagonist who is absolutely terrible (and who apparently refused to do a nude scene on the day they were scheduled to film it, so they left in an awkward scene where she strips down but the camera stays above her shoulders the whole time - how titillating).

A very bloated Val Kilmer makes an appearance, so that is a thing. They must have only had him for a day, because he never appears in the same scene and in the same room as anybody else. Even still, he couldn't manage to stay sober for that single afternoon, so he burps out all of his lines in a sort of groggy stupor. Sadly, he is the best part of the movie.

Or rather,  once or twice multiplied by a trillion.

No wonder Kilmer refused to appear physically,  on the same set at the same time,  with any of the folk responsible for turning the last 7/8ths of this feature into something that felt to me like a particularly trying dental appointment.

And the only thing more cinematically laughable than Prof. Kilmer's deerfly daughter plinking a full-sized copter out of the air with a Ruger Mini-14  .223-cal. ranch rifle was Bruce Willis's grimacing, wholly gunshy performance in"" Last Bald Midget Standing, ""  the egregious insult to Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune' s  ""Yojimbo  that's hit the Net recently.

3935844,5,B002I41KLE,"I admit, I'm a sucker for a good parasite invasion film. The Thaw delivers satisfyingly in that regard with heavy atmosphere, pretty good acting, but a couple strange flaws and character directions every so often as well.  It's about a group of ecology students who visit a deserted town up north.  For a good portion of the first half, they mainly stay in a facility to try and figure out the reason for the unexplainable condition of an older woman after she's discovered passed out right outside the factory with a 4-wheeler turned on (this scene had me convinced momentarily that somebody ELSE was around).  Soon the students realize there's parasite inside of her due to unusual marks on her belly, and parasites have invaded the entire area thanks to that dead polar bear.  Even worse, they're growing rapidly and looking for fresh meat to eat.

Martha Maclsaac, who's incredibly beautiful by the way (especially her smile- too bad she has nothing to smile about in this movie, heh) is the star of the movie.  She initially doesn't even want to visit this facility with the other students, but eventually she gives in.  Turns out to be the worst decision one could ever make!  It's amazing how young she looks in this film.  She looks 15.

Like I say above, the atmosphere is tremendous.  A very dreary setting with heavy cloud cover makes up the surroundings when the students are outside, and small cramped factory hallways make up the majority of the indoor settings.  The other actors could have been better though.  Martha Maclsaac is clearly the best actor.  The other students, especially that of Kyle Schmid, seem really off to me.  Perhaps his reaction to a potential deadly parasite roaming the facility is normal, but the way he took control of the situation by pointing a shotgun at the other students and demanding he's now in control is rather clumsy and unbeneficial.  I wouldn't say the other actors are anything special either.

I love how a couple students have the infection in their blood by way of either peeing blood or a mysterious arm bite but underplay it as no big deal, only to of course reveal it's more significant than they originally let on when they notice it spreading.  The movies eerie tone is a huge benefit and covers up some less than spectacular acting abilities.  There's also a storyline flaw- the boy with the shotgun demands Martha's character take her clothes off after walking into a parasite-covered room in order to go through with a quick experiment, but she never takes her socks and shoes off!  Considering the parasites were swarming the floor, her socks and shoes should have been number one priority and should've been checked first.

Watching the infected students slowly get worse offers several moments of interesting writing, and I highly recommend this movie to all horror lovers.  Also worth noting- the parasites never grow bigger than what you see.  Well at least, not the deformed mega-aggressive supersized monsters that most horror films would implement for exaggerated purposes. Keeping the parasites small assures their main means of aggression is relying on the sheer number of them spawning.  I like that.

The Thaw also has several topical elements, such as global warming which is the reason for this thaw occurring thus the creation of a deadly parasite found in a polar bear, and the timing of watching this movie is interesting because a huge arctic blast coming down from Canada right now and should hit my town in a couple days.  No warming being a factor this year!  Now I can breathe knowing these little parasites won't be coming for me!  Also all the mention of being quarantined is relevant because of the whole ebola crisis that's been in the news.  Great movie overall.",1415577600,,3757,4.835680751173709

The melting of a polar ice cap reveals a deadly new parasite that overtakes a small band of researchers in Northern Canada. It is up to them to prevent the bug from reaching civilization, or it may mean the end of humanity. Paranoia and suspense reign supreme in THE THAW, a winning combination that adds familiar elements from BUG, LONG WEEKEND, RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR, and THE THING together to form terrifying new thriller that is sure to get under your skin! One bite from these flesh-eating bugs can lay thousands of eggs, and once they hatch... Like in THE THING, the game is figuring out which of the students have become infected, and watching as the group falls apart out of fear and mistrust. The pace is perfectly planned around this unfolding drama, with plenty of gory gross-outs found along the way. THE THAW is rounded out by a solid cast and beautiful cinematography, making its only major weakness unfortunate timing, since it follows so many similar films in the past.

3935861,1,B002I41KLE,"the previews, are pretty much the best part, there was plot for this movie [until  the end kinda] still made no sense to me. the acting by some actors was great , but felt they were being rushed. big disappoint.:{",1359244800,,213,4.325
3935862,3,B002I41KLE,"There's something about horror films set in sub-zero conditions that just adds another dimension to movies for me: John Carpenter's The Thing, 30 Days of Night, and The Shining are all excellent examples of movies that have been greatly enhanced by the characters having to deal not only with their respective antagonists but also to contend with the adverse weather conditions and the isolation thrust upon them by the harsh climate.
Having watched the trailer for The Thaw, I thought it showed some promise...

Starring Val Kilmer (The Island of Dr Moreau, Heat, Twixt), Martha MacIsaac (Superbad), Kyle Schmid (A History of Violence, The Covenant, Joy Ride 2), Steph Song and Aaron Ashmore (Fear Island, The Shrine), The Thaw was filmed on location in British Columbia, Canada, the research station where proceedings largely play out is set in a suitably bleak and isolated site, adding another quandry for the visiting students to contend with along with the prehistoric bugs that have been unleashed.

The special effects are largely CGI and obviously so. The practical effects, when brought in to play, were on the whole well-done and one particular scene involving a meat cleaver genuinely left me wincing. The MPAA rated this film as an `R' for ""violence, disturbing images, language and brief sexuality"" and I would say that is appropriate. Some of the scenes here are not for the faint of heart or indeed for entomophobes.

With regards the acting, I'm afraid it was largely perfunctory. Divisive actor Val Kilmer is left with not very much to do in this film and I suggest he's probably been drafted in to add a bit of star pulling power to the project; a real shame since when given a chance to stretch his acting legs, he's capable of some excellent performances, such as his turn as Doc Holliday in Tombstone. MacIsaac's character turns from bratty teenager with daddy issues in the first half of the movie to some kind of brainbox paleoentomologist in the second half and this change is entirely unconvincing and somewhat annoying.
For my money, the best performance came from Schmid who displayed a wide range of emotion across the film as well as being able to present as a more physical actor when required to do so.

Horror movies are tremendous vehicles for conveying allegorical messages to your audience. Romero was noted for it with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead in particular. The Thaw attempts to follow this well-worn horror trend but the environmental message behind the film is laid on thick and without any subtlety whatsoever, rendering any prospective impact it may have had impotent.

At one point, I thought this film was going to play out like Eli Roth's Cabin Fever without the rampaging hormones that were at play in that movie; with some nasty body horror. However, The Thaw was distinctly more pedestrian and I feel that many opportunities were not exploited to their full potential here, making for a long 90 minute viewing.",1356134400,,2979,4.902777777777778

This one has vanishing vomit. Yes, it disappears, sometimes right before the character's eyes and no one seems to notice.

Let me explain. Out at the campsite in the tundra, a woman lies in a tent in a sleeping bag. She is ill. She sits up and vomits cotton balls right beside herself on the mat. A few momenst later, she needs to answer the radio which is across the tent....she crawls right where she vomited...but the vomit is gone.

said woman later arrives at the main camp and is deathly ill. She is placed in a bed and, again, vomit and bile are oozing from her mouth as she dies. In this scene...it comes and goes. One cut it's on her mouth, the next it's gone, then it's back, then it's gone...and none of the characters seem to notice. Even after this when ever her body is shown...it's there or changes shape. And no one notices.

Then there is another female character. She is bitten and falls ill. As she sits on a sofa talking to her boyfriend, she barfs right on the floor. He walks around it and acts like he doesn't see it...and it is gone for the rest of the film. No one is shown cleaning it up.

Later, same girl is in a main traffic hallway and hurls again in front of all the characters. they rush to he aide and apparently stand in it. But no one notices.

3935871,3,B002I41KLE,"Part of the Ghost House Underground series, The Thaw (2009) has an interesting if unoriginal premise that has some potential, but entrusted to youth, it sinks into an ocean of Babel where that potential isn't realized particularly well.  The film bears some obvious similarities to John Carpenter's The Thing (1981), as a group of scientists led by  Dr. David Kruipen (Val Kilmer) discovers an ancient parasite, in the remains of a frozen wooly mammoth embedded in an Alaskan glacier.  While the special effects are passable, unfortunately with college kids in control, reason and intelligence are in very short supply.  Spoilers follow, so you have been warned.

A polar bear infected from eating the mammoth, is captured by Dr. Krupien's team.  The bear soon dies at the group's basestation, and parasitic worms from the animal infect members of the team, who become sick and begin to die.  Kruipen tries to prevent his daughter Evelyn (Martha MacIssac) from joining a group of college students scheduled to arrive at the camp, but she boards a helicopter and lands with pilot Bart (Liv Leacock), and students Federico (Kyle Schmidt),  Ling (Steph Song), and Atom (Aaron Ashmore).  Krupien's group has set up a camp near the mammoth, so the students are on their own at the basestation, and before long, some of them are infected.  Fearing for her life, Jane (Anne Marie DeLuise), an infected member of Krupien's team, shoots Krupien.  She flees, and arrives back at the basestation, but dies after warning the group not to let the parasites spread.  Soon, the worms are on the loose inside the station, threatening the survivors who begin to turn on each other.

By featuring Evelyn (whose age isn't specified, but she often looks and acts like she is about 16), and a bunch of college students, as the main characters, the filmmakers apparently were not interested in appealing to an adult audience (somewhat odd, for an R rated science fiction thriller).  Dumbed down by the writing and some atrociously irritating dialog, the characters spend almost all their time arguing about what to do, and asking each other stupid questions about where they are going, and what are they doing.  The credit/blame appears to be squarely on director and co-writer Mark A. Lewis.  Most of his characters are so irritating and inept, that they distract from the story he is trying to tell.

Bart the pilot, seems intelligent, and you might expect that he would be an authority figure, but surprisingly he displays almost no leadership at all.  Dr. Krupien isn't around much, and he isn't exactly the most rational thinker.  Krupien is not a hero, he's a delusional loser, who leaves his daughter to die.  He should never have survived being shot, but then little about this film rings true.  On the plus side, the special effects while nothing new, and small in scale, are done pretty well.  Too bad the story wasn't better conceived.  Had some different choices been made, this film could have been much better than 2.5 stars.

The Thaw provides some mild entertainment value, although the mentally challenged individuals arguing about what to do, may drive you a bit mad.  The film has some pretentions about delivering a profound message about global warming, but the muddled story and characters that lack credibility, make any points being made hard to take seriously.",1306886400,,3363,4.973166368515206

3935875,3,B002I41KLE,"The Thaw (Mark A. Lewis, 2009)

Here's something I'm not sure I ever thought I'd see: a movie that shows up on the Chiller network that I hadn't heard about before the Chiller network started advertising it that actually doesn't suck. Don't get me wrong, it's a fur piece from great, but considering this is the station that brought us such unbearable crap as Zombie Town, this isn't a step in the right direction, it's a quantum leap.

In any case, the plot: there's a bunch of scientists and their helpers hanging out in the Arctic Circle headed up by Dr. Kruipen (Val Kilmer), a noted climate scientist and former crazy activist. He's up there with his assistant Jane (Anne Marie DeLuise, recently of the Black Christmas remake), their handyman Ed (Horsemen's John Callender), and their native guide-type person Nuti (Sleep Murder's Lamech Kadloo). They're in the midst of tracking a polar bear when they stumble upon a woolly mammoth encased in ice. Fast-forward two months and three university students are chosen to go up to the site and help them out with their research. They are Atom Galen (Smallville's Aaron Ashmore), Federico Fulce (A History of Violence's Kyle Schmid), and Ling Chen (Dim Sum Funeral's Steph Song, the Sexiest Woman in the World, according to FHM a few years back). There's some history between Fulce and Chen, but we don't know quite what until later in the movie. Also coming with them is Evelyn (Superbad's Martha MacIsaac), Kruipen's daughter, who was expressly warned to stay away but has a thing for not listening to her dad, and the helicopter pilot taking them out to the site, Bart (Hot Tub Time Machine's Viv Leacock).

First off: you will hear, in other reviews, all sorts of silliness about how, for a film that's supposed to be set above the Arctic Circle, there's very little snow and no one's breath plumes. That can't be realistic, right? Well, the movie was shot on location. You tell me, bub. Then there's Val Kilmer's performance. Which was bad, true, but compared to some of his other recent flicks (Moscow Zero, Alexander, MacGruber) it wasn't all that awful. What happened to the Val Kilmer who made Real Genius and Tombstone (and was great as recently as Wonderland)? I don't know, but you won't find him in any Val Kilmer movies from the past six years. And okay, William B. Davis is in the movie for about ten seconds. I'll give you that one. And the movie has set off all kinds of crazed global warming fanatics on both sides of the fence, which is irritating. So if I were you I'd ignore the global warming stuff, which isn't nearly as heavy-handed as one would expect given the debates that have been raging since the movie was released, and just take it as a bad horror flick. In which case, it's fun, the acting is at least average, and it has actual, honest-to-god bugs, or CGI good enough that I couldn't tell the difference (as opposed to every Sci-Fi Channel killer-bug movie from the past five years). Sure, there are plot holes and general low-buget horror-movie silliness. If you're expecting a Michael Bay movie, go elsehwere. For those of us who appreciate bad horror movies, this is no Lockout, but it has a lot more to offer than most. (And did no one but me catch that the final scene--and no, this isn't a spoiler, given the opening montage--was a straight-up homage to Cabin Fever? I thought that was hilarious...) ***",1281052800,3,3392,4.707070707070707
3935876,2,B002I41KLE,"Long-dormant bug-like creatures, now awake because of global warming, attack the researchers and college students on the Arctic tundra. Except the brief opening sequence where a disaster of enormous scale is implied, ""The Thaw"" remains a typical low-budget B horror movie with a new trick or two. In this case its trick is Val Kilmer's character, Dr. Kruipen, who is seen dictating something before the camera, or the nasty horror poised to make a huge impact on human beings. Well, that's what he thinks.

Maybe this is not exactly a very original concept, but still works as a serviceable plot. It is a familiar situation where unsuspecting characters, ethnically diverse and mostly young, are trapped in a remote location with unwelcome parasitic creatures. In ""The Thaw"" the creatures can attack from inside your body, and things only get worse when you have to deal with people who start behaving erratically.

The creature effects of ""The Thaw"" are fairly impressive, which means those who don't like bugs or worms crawling on the skin should stay away. The film also uses the beautiful location of British Columbia, effectively creating isolated atmosphere. Unfortunately, the narrative is predictable, sometimes preposterous, with the cardboard characters doing exactly what we know they do. Also, though the acting of Val Kilmer (who appears as a support) is not bad, obviously this is not his best, either.

3935881,4,B002I41KLE,"I was I have to admit a little doubtful at first about _The Thaw_. I knew it was a straight to DVD release and I worried that it would have bad acting, awful dialogue, or just otherwise low production values, perhaps like some of the other bad straight to DVD releases out there or some of the worst of the SyFy movies of the week (especially how they used to be a few years ago before they started improving in quality).

 The movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. In fact, I really liked it. Though the overall plot was not extraordinarily new it boasted one of my favorite go-to genre plots; the isolated Arctic/Antarctic research station having to contend with some horror that they can't get help (or help fast enough) from the outside world, a plotline used successfully in the _The Thing_, the _X-Files_ episode _Ice_ and in the mystery film _Whiteout_. This time though with a nod towards global warming has as its location a Canadian island in the high Arctic, a place that is shown largely snow and ice free, just open tundra with a nearly melted glacier.

 In fact, the movie has more than a nod towards global warming as it is a central theme of the movie. The opening montage shows news footage of global warming related disasters and talking heads on news shows arguing vociferously for or against global warming. I first feared that the film would be preachy (really, a preachy horror movie?) or that the horror would either outright gleefully mock climate change fears or embrace them wholeheartedly with a joy-killing earnestness. Thankfully, the movie did neither.

 The movie opened with a team lead by an environmental scientist played by Val Kilmer. Up there to study the effects of climate change on polar bears (they appear to have used a real polar bear in the filming, one in the wild as far as I could tell, impressive) they come across something. One of the native guides finds just barely covered in the ice of a melting glacier a thawing carcass of a very well preserved woolly mammoth, one so well preserved that the polar bear had been feeding on it.

 Early on there is something ominous though; the polar bear, which they had shot with a tranquiller gun so that they could study it, unexpectedly died off camera. This is a shock to the researchers. What is going on?

 No answers yet as we go to the United States to meet the rest of the cast, the chief scientist's estranged daughter and three graduate students , all of whom are to join the professor at his research camp (one of the students is played by Aaron Ashmore of _Smallville_ fame, a good actor and much appreciated).  Taking them to the research station is a bush helicopter pilot, a good man and a strong character in this film.

 Cutting back to the research station, or rather, the field station camp near the mammoth find, things are clearly not well. The researchers are sick, possibly dying, and Val Kilmer's character, looks defeated, depressed and is obviously making some sort of video diary that has the feel of a last will and testament. He warns the helicopter pilot to not bring his daughter up there (though crucially, and deliberately, says nothing of the students). What is going on?

 I don't think I am giving too much away to say that the threat is some sort of insect-like creature, a parasite, one that had infested the woolly mammoth and now (presumably thanks to global warming) was free, active, and  now making the research team sick. The insects are creepy, the effects they have on people chilling, and there was some really good tension and thrills regarding their threat (and key to the sub-genre of genre films, half the action is the growing paranoia, hysteria, and frustration of people in a very isolated part of the world, far from help, in a life or death situation against something truly unknown and deeply chilling, in a situation where the worst can come out in people and everyone fears everyone else). There however is more than meets the eye at first, truly muddying the waters and making any charge that this is a pro-environmentalist film a difficult one to make in my opinion.

 The cinematography is beautiful. I must confess I have not watched the making of special feature but clearly they were somewhere, not on a soundstage (except maybe while inside the station itself) and were somewhere doing great location shooting. If they weren't in the Canadian Arctic they found a good place to represent it. They also had real helicopters and the CGI was quite good.  There was action but nothing I thought too unrealistic, nothing that I thought the characters wouldn't try or couldn't achieve given their backgrounds.

 All in all a surprisingly good movie. My only complaint was that Val Kilmer seemed little used and tired at first, almost not wanting to be there, an opinion I revised when I saw the entire film, that the amount of time he was used and how he acted very much fit his character's mental state and served the overall plot of the film well. There were some gross scenes but I have seen much, much worse and what was shown I think was necessary to advance the plot and show the very real risk faced by the students and others in the film.",1265500800,2,5208,4.63300760043431

Dr. Kruipen's daughter, Evelyn tries to stop them before it is too late. I'd recommend THE THAW!!!",1258329600,,379,4.757575757575758
3935885,3,B002I41KLE,"Based on past GHOSTHOUSE releases...I didn't expect much. But the premise was such, I was willing to take a chance. A pretty solid Ecological thriller with shades of THE THING. Kilmer doesn't get as much screen time as You'd be led to believe. Good effects. Worth watching.",1258243200,2,273,4.829787234042553
3935886,4,B002I41KLE,"Although this movie is slow in certain parts, it still has a good amount of suspense. Val Kilmer plays his role very well. Kyle Scmid is the most noticeable character who shows a variety of emotions from compassion to apathy. The supporting cast is also impressive. One star has been removed due to some slow scenes.

This is a four star movie.",1257984000,2,344,4.548387096774194
3935887,4,B002I41KLE,"I've reviewed this movie everywhere else so I'll keep it short.  If you liked John Carpenter's The Thing, you will like this movie...at least chances are good.  This is Val Kilmer finally making a movie where he can play on his acting skills and not rely on action/combat skills (which he doesn't have many of).  It's creepy, the setting is perfect and the way it ends makes it all worth it.  At least worth a watch once, I loved this",1257638400,2,434,4.3875
3935888,3,B002I41KLE,"Digging up things in the artic sometimes yields unexpected results. The mammoths we find, for example, show us exactly what the past might have looked like, just as the bodies of people have done for us in the past. Still, there have to be things that would be better off lef to the snowdrifts, and what if one of hose were dug up and found? Could we close Pandora's box before it closed the worldwide chapter on this thing we call humanity? This seems to be the paradox that we might one day be faced with as we take pick and shovel to the snow, not really thinking about something nightmarish that could have been left behind.

As far as movies go, this is nothing new. It involves an outbreak in an isolated community, people trying to cope with the impact on themselves and on the world around hem, and just what they are willing to give up in order to stay alive. The problem the movie has is the fact that some of it is unbelievable and that it has been done over and over: the part that is hard to comprehend is the rate at which the ""thing"" spreads from person to person, and the overdone part is something that is bothersome because it shows just how much movies rely on plot recycling. Add to this some bad acting, some deaths that are horrible but that should have numbered in the ""everyone"" category (really, if you look at the station the people were in, you can see how easily it would be for something like this to get out and get everyone), and how the entire area that the dig as in would be considered a death zone. This sort of gets left on the backburner and leaves major holes in the story, but the movie is a B-movie in disguise and is hard to blame for these mistakes.

If you want to see some snow and some out breaking little legs that follow, then this could be something you might like. I personally enjoyed it but was surprised by the B-movie nature of it considering how it was billed, and this led to a little disappointment on my part. I know that expectation plays a role in this as well, but I'm not sure if hat is my fault or if it is the fault of the way the movie was presented to its audience. So, if expect nothing in the beginning and watch the movie, you might find it entertaining. I did on the second go in the middle of the night, but that was after I shrugged off the first screening and knew what I was getting into. I can't say I recommend it with good conscience to anyone but those who enjoy B-movie terrors, so know what you are getting into before watching the film.",1257379200,3,2516,4.228690228690229

8370643,1,B002I41KLE,"I saw this movie while scrolling through Amazon prime videos. I watched the trailer, saw Val Kilmer was in it, seemed decent, and so I put it in the ""maybe I'll like this"" movie list. Wife and I started to watch the movie and they start mentioning global warming. I was OK with it at first and continued on, I know they need their plot device. Then person after person keeps mentioning global warming and man made global warming. Finally after at least 30 minutes of being preached to repeatedly about global warming, I turned to my wife and said, ""Is global warming all they're going to talk about?"" ""That's what it seems like"" she replied. So on that note, I turned the movie off. Maybe it gets better after the first 30 minutes, but I didn't find out. If you're feeling like being preached to about global warming, perhaps you're Al Gore, this movie may be for you. But if you're not in the mood for that, I'd give this movie a hard pass.",1506902400,,941,4.382857142857143

It seemed like a cross between heavy-handed global warming propaganda and a bad LSD trip.  I was streaming it and at first I thought there was an issue with connectivity but then I realized that was how they chose to shoot the intro!  A two-year old with a smartphone could've done better!  I remember growing up and watching bad movies and trying to tell my parents that ""it will get better""... experience has since taught me that they rarely do.  I wasn't hanging around any longer waiting to see if this one would.  I have better things to do.",1505779200,2,683,4.416
