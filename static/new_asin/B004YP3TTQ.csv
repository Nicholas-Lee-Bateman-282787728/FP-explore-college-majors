Their CDs are great, but the DVD really made the music more alive and amazing.  The DVD was as close to enjoying them in person as possible.  We would recommend seeing them and their other Canadian singers the first chance you can - so alive and spirited with an excellent variety of songs.",1351728000,,430,4.283950617283951
8448705,5,B004YP3TTQ,"A wonderful introduction to three wonderful groups of female musicians - paying tribute to their country's best songwriters.

This review is of the copy I received from Canada where the DVD was released in 2010. I cannot say if the US release from Compass Records is identical.

The (approximately) 90-minute DVD was recorded at a concert in Ontario, Canada, which is where Dala (Amanda and Sheila) hail from. They met in music class in high school and for the last few years have been traveling North America making new friends and fans. I first saw and heard the duo two years ago at the Arts Presenters Conference in New York and most recently saw them (two weeks ago) at the Philly Folk Festival. This DVD really shows why they attached me in the first place: great original songs, some well-chosen ""covers"" and wonderful harmony!

Amanda is blond, parts her long hair on the left and plays guitar with her right hand. Sheila, conversely, has long black hair, parts it on the right, and plays guitar with her left hand! Both play piano. But they write and harmonize TOGETHER! After performing a group of original songs, they bring on stage Suzie Ungerleider - a fellow Canadian singer (who goes by the name Oh Susanna) to perform two numbers -one self-penned the other by Canadian songwriter Ian Tyson). Then Dala joins Suzie for a Leonard Cohen composition. Cohen is, of course, another Canadian. Spot a theme here?). Dala's next set of six songs includes two covers of Neil Young (Canadian!) songs, including ""Ohio"", the song about the May 4. 1970 shootings at Kent State, written years before either Amanda or Sheila were born.

Next up is my other favorite female Canadian group - The Good Lovelies - who wrap another Cohen song (""Hallelujah"") and a (Canadian) Gordon Lightfoot song around one of their originals. Dala returns for another tune and then all six women close out the show with the Band's (Canadian!) hit ""The Weight"", a wonderfully light Everly Brothers cover and Jesse Belvin's 50s hit ""Goodnight My Love"".

Though I urge you to catch all three of these musical groups live, this DVD is the next best thing to being there. I love the ""ladies""; I love the music and I LOVE this DVD.
