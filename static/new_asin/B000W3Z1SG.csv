8221144,1,B000W3Z1SG,"This is the worst Military DVD I've ever owned or viewed.  I often visit the HISTORY Channel and YouTube to view Military Streamed VIDEOs and I think that's what I should have done to get the scoop on the C-47s in Viet-Nam.  I was an Aircrew Member (ARDF Operator) on the EC-47's flying out of DaNang Viet-Nam and Nakhon Phanom (NKP) Thailand and believe me, our daily missions were much more exciting than this DVD could ever depict.  Too much touch and go film of LtCol Flannigan's C-47 Aircraft.  Not enough facts and action scenes about the EC-47's.  The best part of the DVD was the action scenes with A1C Lithgow and the AC-47.  I almost fell asleep watching the rest.  I do not recommend anyone looking for action scenes about the old Gooney Birds purchase this DVD.  I'm sorry I did and will be returning it for a refund!",1341878400,,829,4.48
