8074915,5,B000A6M9Q2,"An unlucky, slightly flaky guy meets a beautiful innocent runaway mental patient who changes his life for the better. What more story could you ask for?

Barefuss (Eng: Barefoot) is one of those romantic comedies that really caught me off guard. I didn't quite know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised throughout. The two leads, Til Schweiger and Johanna Wokalek, play well against each other's characters helping us believe they are who they play, with all their flaws, nuances and surprises that would come from such a relationship. When we expect anger we get compassion, when we expect smooth sailing we get disaster and when we expect a certain ending we get another, much better one. I loved this movie from start to finish and am sad this didn't see much if any US support or distribution. At least they didn't do a remake of it with familiar Hollywood faces because it's perfect as is. One of the best foreign films I've seen in awhile.

The only thing that might be slightly distracting for US viewers is the music. It works well with most scenes but occasionally dips into 'Boogie Woogie' at what most American's would find simply the wrong moment (e.g. heavy emotional scenes and the climax). My guess is that either American audiences associate different things with certain music genres than our German counterparts or the editor took a few creative liberties that don't work for this viewer. But it's a minor issue and, again, this is a great film.

Side note: Be certain your DVD player will play this regional format before purchasing. You don't want to get it and find your DVD player can't read it. Should that happen you might consider changing the region on your computer's DVD drive (this can usually be done through the drive software interface).",1340064000,3,1780,4.80718954248366
8074916,4,B000A6M9Q2,"What a great movie!  I am trying to learn German, and I have watched a number of German films, and ""Barfuss"" is one of the best.  Til Sweiger (Keinohrhasen & Inglorious Bastards) plays a down-and-out prodigal son, Nick Keller, who in desperation takes a janitorial job at a Psych-Hospital.  Of course, he screws-up and gets fired.  However, Leila (Alexandra Neidel), a sweet but highly unstable young woman follows Nick home.  Unable to talk Leila into returning to the hospital and at a loss of what to else to do, Nick takes Leila to his brother's wedding where family and judgment await him.  The odd couple slowly bond as they travel cross-country and arrive at the wedding looking almost like a normal pair of sweethearts. Nick and Leila quickly prove their fragile friendship cannot cope with the family's lofty expectations, and Nick abandons a trusting Leila to the authorities.  Realizing his mistake, Nick's heart pulls him back to Leila just as the authorities arrive and all seems lost.  Nick however will not abandon Leila a second time and proves himself worthy of her love contriving a delightfully happy reunion.  The film has English subtitles and a nice English/American soundtrack. However, the DVD will only play on PAL or Zone Free DVD players.  Zone Free DVD players are easy to get via the internet and are priced about the same as any conventional DVD player.  The investment is easily worth the price if you like foreign film culture as I do.  You'll love Barfuss!",1265155200,7,1489,4.865079365079365
8074917,5,B000A6M9Q2,"I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie, it is very open minded, kind, humanistic, tender,  genuine, emotional, and very deep. Everyone who is working in mental health sphere should watch this movie! Buy a Phillips DVD player at Wallmart for less than 100$ and it will play DVDs from other regions, including this one! It is about love, about what people need to be happy, and how people should treat each other!",1200441600,6,426,4.756756756756757
8074918,5,B000A6M9Q2,"Strong emotions mixed with comical situations and action events. Great love between Nick, an irresponsible worker, and Leila, a run-away mental patient whom Nick had saved from suicide. This is the setting from which unexpected things develop.",1194307200,7,243,5.594594594594595
