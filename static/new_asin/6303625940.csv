A young girl wants to buy Laura's pony but is refused. Pa tells about Christmas. The older girls count their pennies saved for Christmas. [Stores then were owner-operated.] Pa buys powder and lead, then bargains for a set of carriage wheels. [The leaves on the trees are green but that looks like snow on the ground.] Mary wants to work after school as a seamstress. Charles works on repairing wooden carriage wheels. Laura rides her horse Bunny to town. Carolyn bargains for a bolt of cloth. [Note the home-made box on the table.]

Mary knits at Mrs. Whipple's home. Charles is near to completing those wheels. Carey spends her penny on a star. Charles wants to buy a stove but it's sold. Later he shoots a turkey for food. Mr. Olesen delivers a heavy crate to the Ingall's home. Mary gets a warm fur shawl for Christmas. Pa gets a warm shirt. Laura gets a saddle for her pony. Ma gets a cast-iron stove (fuel efficient). They learn Laura traded her pony for that stove. Carey's star is placed on the tree. ""Merry Christmas!""

Could such a show be broadcast today? Why not? You will find the original books are better than a Hollywood recreation.",1348099200,,1198,4.588785046728972
7852905,5,6303625940,"If you want Christmas spirit, look no further than ""Christmas at Plum Creek."" This is a beautiful video with a good message. The entire Ingalls family is struggling to provide their fellow family members with good Christmas gifts, and they end up doing just that by working energetically and making substantial sacrifices. The sacrifice that young Laura makes for her beloved Ma is one that will melt your heart and bring you to embrace the true meaning of Christmas. Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon deliver wonderful performances, just like always. Buy it, you'll be glad u did, it's a wonderful story that has everything about Christmas that is important tied in with it.",1009411200,14,676,4.991150442477876
