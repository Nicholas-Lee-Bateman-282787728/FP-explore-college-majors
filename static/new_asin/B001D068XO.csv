8290594,3,B001D068XO,"Great performance, but barely watchable due to bad motion capture.  In my entire ballet collection, I only have three Blu-rays that have this problem: (1) this one; (2) the Mariinksy version of the same piece; and (3) a Dutch version of Don Quijote. Anything moving is blurred!  Just great for ballet, right!? Nonetheless, I do find myself watching this because I like the performance, especially the Emeralds. (If you watch with your eyes a little unfocused, it's not too bad!)  For one thing, unlike the Mariinsky version, the French don't leave out the final movement, La mort de Melisande, which helps preserve the wonderfully tragic air of the piece. However, the Sicilienne solo (Clairemaire Osla) is somewhat better in the Mariinsky version. All in all, the Mariinsky verson is better because they excel in both Rubies and Diamonds. But then we're comparing two stunning performances.",1507161600,,891,5.13103448275862
8290595,5,B001D068XO,"There are now two versions of this ballet to choose from on Blu-ray. This one by the Paris Opera ballet and recorded in 2005 and the Mariinsky version recorded in 2006 although not released until 2011.

The ballet is a totally abstract creation by George Balanchine based on music by Faure, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. The steps danced in both versions are identical of course and are equally well performed. Both stage settings focus on the colour of the three featured jewels, my preference being for the slightly more sumptuous sets at the Mariinsky theatre. The music is equally well performed and recorded by both teams and both offer finely detailed camera work giving a nice combination of close and panoramic views. The sound in both cases offers good quality surround sound or stereo.

Although this is an abstract creation as mentioned above, it is nevertheless very traditional as regards movements and dress. It best rewards repeat viewing as some people might find the lack of narrative and drama a little dull at first. The target is actually to illustrate grace and abstract beauty as appropriate to the perceived characteristics of emeralds, rubies and diamonds. The music moves from gentle Faure to spikier but accessible Stravinsky and concluding with typical Tchaikovsky but un-typically using the conclusion of his less well-known 3rd symphony.

So which to buy? In this case there is no clear winner in my view although I have a personal preference for the Mariinsky version. Choice could well be based simply on price. I personally would wish to own both as the choices of camera angles and use of close-up and panoramic views vary throughout, sometimes favouring the Paris production and sometimes the Russians.

Prospective purchasers would be safe with either version despite my very slight preference for the Mariinsky recording. As that is an entirely personal preference others could easily choose the other way round and for similar subjective reasons. In my opinion therefore, both are worth the full 5 stars and will give much satisfaction.",1343520000,4,2071,5.118343195266272
8290596,1,B001D068XO,"I had to chime in to (unfortunately) totally agree with Lars Sandell's ""Beware of fuzzy dancers"" review, in hopes that it might speed Opus Arte to remaster and re-release this wonderful ballet. This production of Jewells is beautifully danced by beautiful dancers but, as Mr. Sandell said, once they start moving, the blurring begins. And watching it did in fact begin to give me a headache. I'm a bit torn about a purchase of this blu-ray. I felt lucky to acquire it at a good price and, having never experienced this ballet before, loved being able to see it - sort of - but I can't recommend anyone purchase this particular disk. Opus Arte MUST remaster it. Otherwise, I suggest looking for a different production.",1335657600,4,717,4.744
8290597,3,B001D068XO,"The Paris Opera Ballet is a great company, but there is something missing from their performance of Balanchine's ballet.  They perform ""Emeralds"" and ""Diamonds"" with frosty perfection; only ""Rubies"" comes to life.",1306368000,,213,5.65625
8290598,1,B001D068XO,"Great ballet performances on Blu-ray are a joy to behold, not least because of the stunning HD image, but this one must have been incorrectly mastered as it goes horribly fuzzy as soon as the dancers move. Standing still, they are crystal clear. I own a dozen Blu-rays of ballets, including several produced by Opus Arte, and they all look magnificent and sharp - even in extremely fast movement. I previously bought the DVD of this title, but returned it to the shop as defective. So imagine my disappointment when I saw that the Blu-ray was just as blurry. Hopefully, Opus Arte will correct this when a new pressing is due, but that might take years, I'm afraid. I advise potential customers to stay away from ""Jewels"". Watching this ""smear"" gave me a headache and was painful to the eyes. What a pity, as this a a gorgeous balett.",1271808000,28,833,4.597315436241611
8290599,5,B001D068XO,"This is a perfect example of what a DVD of a ballet should be:  great video reproduction, great camera shots (these were so good you don't even take note) with minimum movement, a decent look at the gorgeous Garnier,  the audience, a view of the orchestra and conductor, each ballet starting with the curtain rising (there is nothing more frustrating than to be thrust into the first scene without a feeling approach to its beginning), interviews with the etoiles. the director, the director of the Paris Opera, and last but definitely not least, an interview and commentary by Christian Lacroix, and, oh yes, probably the greatest ballet company on the planet! All of the principal ballerinas were such pleasures to watch.  My fav was Auriel Dupont in Rubies. Balanchine at his best, and the greatest company in the world serving him.

What makes this so special, is not only the aforementioned, but the endearing and enduring music of  Faure, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky, and along with all the other accolades I can think of was the wonderful feeling that I had spent an evening at the ballet.  Hats off to the producers and those who made ""Balanchine Forever"".  Ooops, I almost forgot one of the sparkling personalities in the video:  Barbara Horgan, who became Balanchines assistant in the '50s, and who put everything in context.  Yup, Ms. Horgan was the wrapping on this gorgeous DVD.

Highly, recommended.",1268265600,2,1412,4.944915254237288
8290600,4,B001D068XO,"This is a modern ballet of 3 pieces performed in classical style - 1. Emeralds, danced in green to music by Faure; 2. Ruby, danced in red to music by Stravinsky; 3. Diamonds, danced in white to music by Tchaikovsky.
It is abstract ballet with no particular story although, as the accompanying documentary relates, that does not mean the dancing lacks emotion. The staging is deliberately free of distractions so one concentrates on the exceptional dancing. The piece was inspired by jewels Balanchine noticed in the window and this is the first time it has been proudly presented by the Ballet of the Opera national de Paris which claims credit as being one of the founding ballet companies in the world. I feel this is a disc one will appreciate more and more on repeated viewing. The Faure music is instantly appealing although the Stravinsky requires more familiarisation and the Tchaikovsky is a selection from the lesser known 3rd Symphony. The video is up to the usual BD standards but I was less impressed with the audio and did not find it up to the latest BD standards. It lacked the depth possible with the latest format.
So, bottom line of how this disc will appeal to you is how much you like ballet. The dancing is first class and that is the big plus for ""Jewels"". But if you are looking for spectacular staging with dramatic music and story then this might not appeal. That said it has a lot to offer and I suggest it is very helpful to look at the very good 1 hour documentary before viewing the work. So strongly recommended, but with a few cautions.",1249862400,,1567,4.580071174377224
