8284177,5,B001BPJ7V6,"Gorgeous story of Madame Maintenon.  If you love french history, especially the Bourbons, you'll eat this up like a box of candy.  Beautifully filmed, however dated, good sub-titling, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Realistic-looking people/actors as well which I appreciated.",1467072000,5,271,6.078947368421052
8284178,5,B001BPJ7V6,"While there seems to be no letup in the stream of Louis XIV books starting from when he was still a teenager, the screen has been much less well served. Despite the fact that new books on the Sun King (Hilton: Athenas, Mossiker: The Affair of the Poisons, Fraser: Love and Louis XIV) have appeared with regularity even in recent years, there are still few movies or miniseries about the King's reign, and even fewer that make an effort to stay close to the actual history. This is a big exception, and it is no surprise that it is the French who have made it (and yes, there is no English dubbing, only subtitles, but fans of this period would not want it any other way). All of the characters, and the court itself, are wonderfully portrayed, as the story follows Louis and Franoise from their thirties into a rather gloomy old age. A real plus, virtually unknown in films about this period, is the sound track conducted by French Baroque specialist Christophe Rousset, consisting exclusively of music from the period.

Louis comes across as a rather ordinary but hard-working and generally well-meaning man whose actions and self-importance certainly stem from the situation he was born into. This series, following the actual history as closely as one might expect, is essentially about a triangle: Louis, Athenas (the Marquise de Montespan)and the principle character, Franoise D'Aubign&eacute; (the widow Scarron, later Madame, and later still the Marquise de Maintenon). The story starts with Franoise's childhood, and we meet Athenas and her many friends long before Louis appears. When we do meet him he is at the height of his fascination for Athenas, who has chosen her friend Franoise, rescued by her from near poverty, as governess for her illegitimate children by the King.

As others have remarked, it was the children and the love and care Franoise gave them (in marked contrast to Athenas who could hardly wait for the next party) that gradually won the King. It's also clear that Franoise, whom he eventually married in secret, was one of the few women he knew who neither sought to exploit him or gave themselves up mindlessly to his physical attentions. Although not easy to portray in a series like this without losing focus, the King's growing pangs of conscience over his many adulteries and his fear of God's judgment made the deep but unostentatious piety of Franoise especially attractive to him.

The universe of Versailles in the reign of the Sun King was a large one, and lasted a long time, so one can always regret that many interesting characters are given scant notice, such as the King's brother Monsieur (he only has a brief walk-on near the end) and the artistic and literary figures that were the objects of the King's support (Lully, Le Ntre, Racine, Corneille and Moli&egrave;re). In compensation, the costumes, sets, and of course the music, are wonderful. Louis, his loves and his court have never been better served. Highly recommended.",1269907200,24,2977,4.902777777777778
8284179,5,B001BPJ7V6,I recently purchased this DVD it came quickly. It said original French version with English Version. Where's the English? It has subtitles is that what they mean?,1266364800,2,162,5.037037037037037
8284180,5,B001BPJ7V6,"This film is about the life of Madame de Maintenon and her relationship with King Louis XIV.  As a lavish period film it is very well done.  It is also filled with characters that are diverse and compelling.  The acting is good too and the story, though a bit linear, is also well worth 2 DVD's  This was originally a TV show in France not a theatrical release.

Of all the Louis XIV film's I have seen this is the best.

Do not make the mistake of trying to find an English dubbed version.  The French version is the best and just read the subtitles.",1236729600,36,551,4.190476190476191
