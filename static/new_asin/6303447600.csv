7846991,2,6303447600,"BUBBLEGUM CRISIS, an eight-part OAV series which first appeared in 1987, is significant in the history of Japanese animation as one of the earliest successes in the first wave of official anime video releases to hit the U.S. back in 1991. Set in Mega-Tokyo in the year 2032, it offered a mix of sci-fi cyberpunk, music video and crime thriller as it told the tale of the Knight Sabers, a private para-police group of attractive young women who don ""hard suits"" and go after rogue ""Boomers,"" bio-engineered androids who do much of the work in this dystopian future society. In the process, the girls frequently butt heads with their rivals, the A.D. Police.
The main reason to see this series today is because its such a vivid example of 1980s style sci-fi anime. The linework is clear and bold, the colors bright and the settings dramatic and finely etched. The character design may be too simple and rounded and the character animation stiffer than wed like, but the animators save up their juice for the plentiful action scenes in which the Knight Sabers speed through the streets and over the buildings of Mega-Tokyo, attacking rampaging Boomers with gusto and awesome amounts of firepower. Later versions of this story offer more graphic detail in terms of design and settings, but would be far less eye-catching.
The first story, ""Tinsel City,"" is the best of the three offered on this tape. At 46 minutes, its the longest (the others are 28 minutes each) and follows the Knight Sabers as they are hired by USSD (a space defense agency) to investigate the disappearance of a six-year-old girl and the USSD employee who may have kidnapped her. The Sabers search leads to the discovery of a monster creation linked to the all-powerful Genom Corporation. The other two stories, ""Born to Kill"" and ""Blow Up,"" are much less satisfying, given as they are to long, confusing tangents involving subsidiary, short-lived characters and a lack of adequate explanation. Even more troublesome is the lack of attention given to the girls character development. By the end of the third episode, we get some small sense of who rock singer Priss and heiress/clothing shop owner Sylia are, but we never quite get a handle on aerobics instructor Linna and police department operator Nene, at least in these early episodes. (The series reportedly gets better in later episodes.) Overall, the character development is handled much better in the 1998 TV remake, ""Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040."" This tape is English-dubbed and includes a number of songs, all English-language versions of the Japanese originals.",1058745600,,2593,4.990762124711316
7846992,5,6303447600,"""It is the Year 2032 A.D. Like a Phoenix, the city of Mega Tokyo is rising from the ashes of a devestating earthquake. In the twisted canyons of the megalopolis, the Knight Sabers, a small band of high-tech mercenaries, fight a lonely battle with the evil GENOM Corp. and it's sinister Androids, the ""Boomers.""
With those words, the world of Bubblegum Crisis emerges like the city that suffered the earthquake 7 years before in the series.
The Bubblegum Crisis Storyarc encompasses 8 Episodes and two ""Music"" Videos and setups a world where 4 women fight a battle where the future might as well be now. Underlying tones of Man vs. Machine and Technology run amuck encompass thru a gritty Industrial Rock Soundtrack and ""gritty"" Animation style.
The 4 main characters that comprise the Knight Sabers (Priss Asagiri (Punk Rock Singer and main ""Artist"" for many of the Songs in the Series), Linna Yamazaki (Aerobics Instructor), Nene Romanova (AD Police Officer), and Sylia Stingray (Owner of ""Silky Doll"" Lingerie Shop and ""leader"" of the Knight Sabers) fight a war against varying Boomers and GENOM itself. From a Rogue USSD Programmer and his little Sister (Episode 1, Tinsel City); 4 ""Sexy"" Boomers after the murder of Linna's Friend Irene over the matter of some Black-Ops development (Episode 2, Born to Kill); a GENOM re-development plan that claims the life of someone ""close"" to Priss and GENOM's Executive Mason trying to find out the true identities of the Knight Sabers (Episode 3, Blow Up); the Knight Sabers try and stop a Man getting revenge with a Horrible Masterpiece of Revenge (Episode 4, Revenge Road); A breakout of Several Women from an orbiting Space Station and Priss befriending someone that hides a horrible secret that could spell doom for Mega Tokyo (Episode 5, Moonlight Rambler), A mysterious New Opponent stalks the Knight Sabers by defaming their name and Priss trying to atone for her actions before (Episode 6, Red Eyes); A singer get's revenge over her sister that was murdered in ""Born to Kill"" that draws the Knight Sabers into the foray (Episode 7, Double Vision); and a inspiring reporter tries to reveal the true identity of the Knight Sabers (Episode 8, Scoop Chase), you'll find at least one episode for you to pique your interest.
Whether it's for the underlying BladeRunner references (GENOM Tower, Priss and THE REPLICANTS, etc.) to the gritty and jam-packed soundtrack, there's something for everyone.",1011657600,,2444,5.022167487684729
7846993,3,6303447600,"Great Animation, Great Music (especially the club scenes where Priss sings), and great Mecha suits. But I found the plot lacking. That's why I gave it a 3, but when I watched the next one I see that there is more to  this than meets the eye. It's worth getting because you need the first  movie in the series to understand the rest.
2040: Megolithic Tokyo,  seemingly run by a huge robot creation company. These robots, called  ""boomers"", are basically polite slave labor. Used to do the dirty  work (eg. Dishes, cunstruction, scribeing). But something can go wrong,  these ""boomers"" can go insane.
In come the ""Knight  Sabers"", these Mecha-Clad babes fight the mad boomers. Useing  high-tech weapons and armor to aid them. Priss, Linna, and Nene.. lead by  the daughter of the man who invented these robots.
There is more plot  then first meets the eyes, buy this one and then get the rest.",952560000,,891,4.690322580645161
7846994,4,6303447600,"As a Bubblegum crisis fan for many years, I snatched this up the moment I saw it on the shelf and have not been disappointed.  It is not the same old Bubblegum Crisis.  The characters have been redone, mostly for the better,  except Priss who is the same old Priss.  Sylia has suffered from this  rewrite in my opinion, turning into someone who is in need of a good  psychiatrist.  The music isn't as good as in the original, but the  animation is much better.
This first tape in the series starts off  somewhat slowly and it takes some patience to get to the action and the  boomers, or even the Knight Sabers for that matter.  The original started  with a a bang, this version starts in a more mundane fashion, but at the  same time, this is the dawn of the Knight Sabers existance as they are  first emurging onto the landscape of Mega-Tokyo.
I bought this tape in  only the subtitled version and found it to be good.  I have seen tape two  in both formats, and have to say that while I usually prefer subtatiled  anime, in this case I prefer the dubbed.  It is well done and there are  subtle points which are missed when reading the sub-titles which come  through more clearly in the dubbed version.
All in all, I am very happy  with the new Bubblegum Crisis and have already placed my orders for the  next two tapes in the series.",948153600,,1336,4.319838056680162
7846995,4,6303447600,"I never saw the original Bubblegum Crisis, so I don't know what I'm missing.  I saw an ad for this so I went out and bought it.  I was pretty suprised,everything was impressive, except for the wanky guitar jigs before  the commercial breaks.  A very good tape and an excellent start for those  new to anime.",941673600,,307,4.410714285714286
7846996,5,6303447600,The story is set in future tokyo (what sci-fi anime is not?) which is still recovering from a major earthquake. The story revolves around the fight between a corrupt company called GENOM and a group of female  vigilantes called Knight Sabers. This 8-part series has a excellent  collection of songs that make up its soundtrack. The music reminds me of  80's rock and roll. If you watch only one anime series in your life make it  this one. You won't be disappointed!!!!!,933811200,5,470,4.695121951219512
