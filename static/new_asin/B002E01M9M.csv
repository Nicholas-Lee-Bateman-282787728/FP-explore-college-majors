8366606,5,B002E01M9M,"The story of Gervaise reminded me, in many ways, of my beloved Les Miserables.  The atmosphere and expanse of storytelling more than anything else.  While the film does deal with similar themes, it is entirely its own story.  Still, the comparison was a benefit, at least for me, since it made me fall even quicker in love with this tale.

Gervaise tells the story of a young mother who is a gimp, working hard to support herself and her mooching boyfriend who eventually leaves her destitute and alone, and with her name smeared all over the towns gossip.  She moves on from this tragedy to find and fall for a seemingly charming man who wants to take care of her.  Sadly, on the eve of a life changing event (where Gervaise is going to become her own boss, buying a launderette), her husband has a tragic accident that costs him his job and his confidence.  While on the outset it may appear that they have collectively moved on from this tragedy, Gervaises husband Henri has turned to alcohol to kill his pain and this has caused a riff in their marriage.  Enter a few faces from the past that only bring with them conniving pain and misery and you have the story of Gervaises life.

Overall, this is a tremendous film from renowned French director Rene Clement.  The performances across the board are stellar, with the men in Gervaises life taking center stage.  Francois Perier is devastating as Henri, but for me it was Armand Mestral who stole the whole film as the conniving and self-centered Lantier.  Hes devilish in all the right places and completely gets under the skin with a single glace.  I love an actor that is working it, even when hes not the focal point of a scene.  He lingers in the background and his face says so much.  Maria Schell is very good here, except for the fact that she seemed to forget she had a gimp in some parts of the film, which was a shame.

Gervaise is a marvelously detailed film that will reach into your soul and yank a piece of it out!",1402012800,,1983,4.4515235457063715
8366607,5,B002E01M9M,"In Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's ""Gervaise"" from 1955, we get an unbiased and realistic depiction of the 'working-class', in the Paris of the 1870's. Based on &Eacute;mile Zola's novel ""L'assommoir"", Maria Schell gives an unforgettable performance in the title role of ""Gervaise"", she was simply magical! The film paints a very ugly truth and fact: in how women and children are the real victims of poverty! In romanized/chauvinistic societies like that of France (including Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Latin America for that matter), women have no real say (this of course, has moderated greatly since those days), and the exploited become exploiters themselves (especially the men, here however, the villainous character of 'Virginie' excellently played by Suzy Delair, easily gave the men a run for their money). An exception was the character of 'Goujet' (Jaques Harden), who truly symbolized the principles of ""Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity"", and offered 'Gervaise' a way out. She however, continued to make very poor choices and, was ensnared in her downward spiral. I don't want to give anymore away, so as to spoil it for anyone. An excellent film, by one of the world's true ""auteurs"" (I'm sure even David Lean must have been very impressed with the cinematography, editing, etc., etc.). I highly recommend this powerful film! This Criterion edition, is of course first-rate. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 117 mins.

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1397001600,,1465,5.369565217391305
8366608,5,B002E01M9M,"Director Rene Clement and actress Maria Schell excel in this adaptation of the novel ""L'Assommoir"" (""The Dram Shop"") by French literary writer Emile Zola.  Schell plays a young mother with a partially disabled leg, who works very hard to support her family by starting her own Laundry business in a working-class slum in Paris of the 19th century, only to have the fruits of her labor consumed and her work ultimately destroyed by two men: her unfaithful, parasitic ex-husband and her alcoholic, dead-beat second husband.  It is a tragic tale of the consequences for women of paternalistic property laws and restrictive divorce laws.  The last scene (""The Absinthe Drinker"" by Edgard Degas?) is not pretty.  One can only admire the spirit with which Gervaise struggles, against insuperable odds, to make a decent life for herself and her children.  The French have a knack of telling morality tales without sentimentality and with sensitivity and compassion.",1393718400,,958,5.194805194805195
8366609,5,B002E01M9M,"I had seen this a long time ago and had forgotten all the details. Seeing it again, I realized how Victor Hugo like it was, but with far more gritty realism. I do not think any American director could have come close to the impact this made on me. Maria Schell did this role perfectly and the rest of the cast was excellent, but Rene Clement was fabulous in his portrayals and editing. This is definitely one of the best films I have seen, and from a genre that is not normally one of my favorites.",1373241600,,498,4.197916666666667
8366610,5,B002E01M9M,"It is intersting that few (only one I can see) actually refers to the Criterion/Essential Art House release on DVD. SO.... First search for a good price. Mine $6.53 - an amazing price (plus postage to U/K of course). The Dvd box is secure and good. There is a useful little leaflet inside which includes a cast list (Thank You Criterion). The print is more than decent - it's very good - crystal clear B/W in 4.3 ratio. Subtitles are easy to read. So that's all good. Maria Schell is superb, and whilst the film is hardly a bunch of laughs, it is so beautifully, lovingly made that you can't help being sorry when it's over (well I couldn't). Be warned tho-It isn't for the faint hearted. Highly, unreservadly recomended",1354492800,2,720,4.546153846153846
8366611,5,B002E01M9M,"A story about life in the Parisian slums?  No maudlin sentimentality, no sex, no murder, no rape, no villains?  This is as dead realistic a view of the working class world of 19th century Europe as we are ever likely to see in film.  It is the very lack of fake sentimentality that distinguishes this, from let's say, a typical Dickens film.

Why is this a great picture?  The first reason is the marvelous performance of Maria Schell as ""Gervaise.""  Until the very end, when her small laundry business is trashed by her alcoholic, abusive husband, she faces her harsh life with optimism and sheer determination. There are touching scenes as when she celebrates her birthday with a delicious roast goose dripping with juice that is shared with her neighbors, friends, and employees...or when she reaches for a kiss from her lover. There are exciting moments when she gets into a vicious cat-fight with another laundress over her husband's infidelity. And there is the poignant last scene when she sinks into alcoholism herself after her business and self-worth is ultimately lost, through no fault of her own.

The director pays a lot of attention to all the characters in this rich film. In addition, he presents us with Paris scenes that are unbelievably realistic...down to the cobblestones, the worn clothes, and the dirty old street fronts.  Zola, even more than Victor Hugo, made the life of the working poor vivid in print.  Rene Clement should be congratulated for respecting the source material and bringing it to life as accurately as possible.",1337040000,3,1554,4.923371647509579
8366612,4,B002E01M9M,"A classic film of a classic book.
Seeing a film from 1956 now, is always a bit risky in terms of what to expect, but I was very pleasantly rewarded.  I had read the book too long ago to remember its details, but not its impact - and the film in no way came up short. It was very well acted by Maria Schell, and the supporting cast was generally very good.
I was urged to buy it since it was shortly going to be withdrawn from the catalogue, and am very glad I did so.
The print is very decent for its age, and although I would not elevate this film into the pantheon of all time greats, its classical pedigree and excellent period mood make it way above average for its vintage.",1333497600,4,678,4.059701492537314
8366613,5,B002E01M9M,"Gervaise and Forbidden Games both directed by Rene Clement are two of the most beautifully visual films ever made.  This director was certainly blessed with unparaleled artistic ability and it is a honor and joy to view these films.  And, of course, Maria Schell's once in a lifetime performance delivers a real knock out punch.  MUST SEE!",1327190400,3,339,4.912280701754386
8366614,5,B002E01M9M,"When I saw this movie, I forgot Schell playing ""Gervaise""--she was Gervaise! The great director,
Rene Clement had made a true masterpiece; and the entire acting was superb, most especially by
the most gifted actress--Ms. Maria Schell. Highly recommended!",1288915200,4,254,5.538461538461538
8366615,5,B002E01M9M,I was only 12 years old when I saw this film in 1957 in New Zealand and at that tender age rated it as one of the very best films that I had ever seen. Seeing  it on television  several times in recent years has not diminished  my feelings in calling this an unforgettable masterpiece. This is one of those rare  classics that still lingers in the mind fifty years later.,1255478400,11,371,4.183098591549296
