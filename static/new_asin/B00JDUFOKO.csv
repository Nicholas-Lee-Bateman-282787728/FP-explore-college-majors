6355340,4,B00JDUFOKO,This is a great film for a bit of escapism. What more could you want bikini girls and zaney one liners. Who would of thought a piece of cheese could have such drastic consequences.,1454284800,,180,4.323529411764706
6355341,5,B00JDUFOKO,"Over the weekend I watched a hilarious film by Kenneth Barker called Bikini Girls v Dinosaurs: The Movie. Had seen the trailer and was not really sure if it would be funny or if everyone who has seen it was just being nice! Laughed my head off, out loud, it's brilliant and original, well worth seeing. Congratulations to all the cast and crew and especially to the director!",1402444800,,375,4.529411764705882
6355342,5,B00JDUFOKO,"Heard about this film from a friend. Thought ""What the....?""

However, the title is misleading and makes it sound like some under the counter video from the 70's. In fact, there is nothing in this film I couldn't show my aged old Mum or my daughter (who loved it by the way)

This film is a fine example of what someone can do when lack of budget is more than made up by a great imagination. Some funny bits, some very funny bits and some not so funny but make you smile bits.

A lot of it I could not understand - and I guess i wasn't supposed to. There is no secret to enjoying this film - it is what it is - mad!

The highlight of the show was without a doubt a fine performance from ""Monkey Thing"". I see great things ahead for him/her/it.

Let loose. Buy it. There are worse things in the fridge than cheese.",1401667200,,813,4.05625
6355343,5,B00JDUFOKO,"This is clearly a film that doesn't take itself seriously. In the opening Star Wars-like text, we are told it is set somewhere where ""a packet of digestive biscuits will cost you well over 138"". For the rest of the exremely short 51 minute running time, the one-liners, film references and visual gags come thick and fast. My only real complaint is that it was over too quickly.

Bear in mind that this is a very low-budget film. Don't expect Jurassic Park or Star Wars standards of special effects and set design, more like an episode of Dr Who from the 80s. This actually suits the mood of the film quite well, and at times it even mocks its own special effects (the 'Made in China' engraving on the fighter windows for example).

It's possibly not for everyone, but SF fans with a sense of humour should love it.",1401408000,2,815,4.4630872483221475
6355344,5,B00JDUFOKO,"This is a gloriously funny indy film, which doffs its cap to various sci-fi films of the past.

Agreed, it's low budget, but I'm happy to report that the film-makers decided to skimp on costumes, cutting them to the bare minimum and concentrating instead on the story :)

Dinosaurs, boobies and a rollickingly good adventure.  What better way to spend an evening?",1398643200,,363,4.82258064516129
6355345,5,B00JDUFOKO,"Warning: this review contains excessive use of hyphens and portmanteaux.

I was fortunate enough to attend the premiere of this glorious wedge of indy cake, and I can honestly say it was one of the most joyous evenings of my life to date. However, a foreword.

When reviewing any work of art, one should always have half an eye on the resources that have been squirted into it; it is all too easy to be dazzled by Michael Bay's flashy (and ludicrously expensive) ILM robots and explosions, for instance, or James Cameron's impossibly extravagant Titanic replicas and blue aliens made with yet more CGI, or the slick editing and shiny suits in any music video of the last twenty years... one could almost be forgiven for being distracted from the essential banality of such cynical, corporatised output. Such is the case with much of mainstream film, music, TV, even some top-end theatre... anything designed primarily to make money rather than communicate something meaningful or beautiful or fun. High production values are often camouflage for a lack of soul.

Further down the budgetary food chain things get more difficult, and so the pieces which get made are propelled forward by the vision, energy, determination, sacrifice and heart of a small band of committed individuals or even a central, singular auteur. Such an auteur we find in Bikini Girls Vs Dinosaurs' writer / director / producer / editor / foley artist / set builder / costumier / barman (for the premiere) Kenneth Barker. His personal drive to produce a piece of independent sci-fi built on his own ideals of what makes such movies great has resulted in a sprawling, madly ambitious, reference-packed, often splendidly nonsensical slice of rollercoaster cinema which truly dropped my jaw in terms of how many of his lofty ambitions it achieves... and all this on a budget of roughly sixteen pence.

- Star Wars 'Red Three checking in' pastiche, complete with lovingly handcrafted space fighter cockpit (sorry, cockpits, obviously) from which all the suspiciously-similarly-helmeted pilots check in (and make toast)? Check.

- Bikini-clad hottie in barehanded punch-up a la Captain Kirk with astonishingly-rendered CGI dinosaur? Check.

- Gleefully villainous high-collared baddie with long-suffering android (definitely not Borg or C3PO, copyright fans) sidekick? Check.

- Fake NASA videos and Hitch-Hikers Guide tribute graphic-and-voiceover segments (of, it must be said, breathtakingly high quality given the budget)? Check and check.

- Screechingly deranged Bosley figure of indeterminate gender, ending every sentence with 'my gorgeous darlings'? Er... check.

- Abrupt pace shifts to dark-as-you-like bonkers science 'man' chillingly executing teddybears with injections of formaldehyde? Um... check. But 'his' motivation escapes me even if it was my favourite part. One more lingering (not to say immobile) gaze from the Ewok, please, Kenneth? Utterly hysterical. Best editing of the decade.

This gorgeous labour of love, the puppydog-affectionate test-tube offspring of Barbarella, One Million Years BC, Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill! and Spaceballs, is uneven in the best way - following a stylistic lead set by Russ Meyer and everything that ever featured Robbie the Robot. In common, too, with Meyer's actresses of limited wardrobe, BGvD's three energetic leads vanquish the threat of being outshone by small triangles of fabric: their swashbuckling enthusiasm for backflipping spaceships and duffing up dinos is infectious and endearing.

I began my review by talking about production values and budgets, but this is only to put this towering achievement into context; many filmmakers have achieved a lot less with a lot more, is what I'm saying. Kenneth Barker and his merry band have achieved the cinematic equivalent of flying to the sun using glue and feathers, but their wings certainly don't look like melting soon. I can't wait to see what comes next.",1397174400,3,3943,5.323151125401929

6355356,1,B00JDUFOKO,"Clocked out at 7:43.  Since the producers aimed about low as they could without shooting off their own kneecaps, it was immediately obvious that coherent and clever plotting, high production values, good camera work, competent acting, and all the other ingredients of a good movie were not only neglected, but unwelcome.  That left only the bikini girls. They weren't much to look at, and they were punishing to listen to.  Spare yourself the experience.",1479254400,4,454,5.108108108108108
