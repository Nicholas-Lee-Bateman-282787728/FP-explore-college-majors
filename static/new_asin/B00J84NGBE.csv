8648695,5,B00J84NGBE,Great seeing Jean Arthur in a Silent Movie.,1420761600,,43,4.5
8648696,5,B00J84NGBE,"Lots of effort went into bringing us this rare film and I appreciate it. Although I'm familiar with lots of silent films, the name Monty Banks had escaped me. I thoroughly enjoyed the musical score which was appropriate and added immensely to the film. The ""gags"" seemed a little familiar a few times, but over-all a very good comedy. I also was glad to have the chance to see Jean Arthur in one of her earlier films. I had heard on Nitrateville that there was a reported problem with the disc's soundtrack, so I listened for that. My copy did not have this problem. I watched both the film and the Lindbergh newsreel extras.",1399075200,6,625,4.491228070175438
8648697,5,B00J84NGBE,"Although he was a solid second or third tier comedian during the silent era, aside from a few short subjects, most of Monty Banks' films remain unavailable today. Fortunately, that oversight has been remedied with the release of 'Flying Luck', a solid piece of entertainment which is sure to delight not only film aficionados, but also anyone interested in early aviation. It's a first rate production, aided immensely by a whimsical story-line, and professionally handled by a score of talented character actors from the apex of the silent era, as well as an incredibly young and beautiful Jean Arthur, who would shine even brighter during the sound era (""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"", ""Shane"",  and many others). The source material for this film, and the DVD transfer are of high quality, with a snappy musical accompaniment that complements the action perfectly. An added bonus is the inclusion of rare newsreel footage documenting Charles Lindbergh, and his groundbreaking 1927 transatlantic flight. Don't pass up an opportunity to pick up this rare reflection of Americana. The subject matter encompasses a fascinating era of history which turned the world on its heels.",1399075200,2,1177,5.227513227513228
8648698,5,B00J84NGBE,"Monty Banks was a big comedy star in the 1920s and apart from starring in dozens of shorts, he made a number of top feature films too.
FLYING LUCK isn't the best feature he made but it IS very entertaining (and VERY rare!). The 35mm print is in pretty good shape and, amazingly, it's the only MONTY BANKS feature to have been released (so far) on DVD.
His superior features, ATTA BOY and PLAY SAFE, both reside at the Library of Congress and are crying out for DVD release (hey Ben, how about a Kickstarter?!)
Humungous congrats and respect to the powerhouse Ben ""fingers"" Model, as well as Bruce Lawton and the other guys who helped get this in front of our eyeballs.",1398470400,2,668,4.439024390243903
8648699,5,B00J84NGBE,"Original plot, great photography, wonderful print quality and JEAN ARTHUR.  Also, musical score for all of us who know a great score when we hear it.  I can't wait to watch the other releases from Model and company.",1398038400,6,215,4.631578947368421
8648700,4,B00J84NGBE,"Have to agree completely with the other reviewers. Monty is underrated and underrepresented on video. Hope Mr. Model can accidentally uncover more Banks' bonanzas. Or Raymond Griffiths', please.

As to the disc itself, something like 4-6 audio dropouts of the score occur throughout the presentation, which takes me out of the wonderful viewing experience of a comedian like Monty. Image is nice, but soft and rough. To be expected due to the lack of the availability of quality Monty Banks film sources.

Lots of fun. Thank you Mr. Model.",1397606400,4,539,5.044943820224719
8648701,5,B00J84NGBE,"Should there be another Oscar presented to a saviour of silent films-
let's call it the ""Brownlow Award""- may it go to Mr. Benjamin Model.
His expertly performed scores provide, in this instance,
the perfect accompaniment for
1.  An unjustly neglected comedian -Monty Banks- and comedy-Flying Luck.
2.  Three bonus Charles A. Lindbergh vintage newsreels.
Highly recommended.",1396483200,8,374,5.543859649122807
8648702,4,B00J84NGBE,"At last Monty Banks' silent feature FLYING LUCK is available on DVD.  For those unfamiliar with Banks, he was one of the great comedians of the silent era, who is today forgotten.  While some of Banks' short subjects have found their way to DVD (Grapevine video has a collection), I believe this is his first feature to do so.  Lindbergh's famous flight is referenced throughout, as Monty plays a pilot joining the army. Running a full hour, this is a good introduction to Monty Banks for the uninitiated.  Perhaps the future will bring some of his other features to DVD, like ATTA BOY or PLAY SAFE. In any case, we have FLYING LUCK, so we can enjoy it...and I suspect you will.",1396483200,9,678,4.532786885245901
