There were over 500 films made for African-American audiences, fewer than 100 of these films have survived, but here are 8 of those films all on a DVD set. I've replaced my VHS videotapes with these and other DVDs offered here, what a deal!",1418947200,5,366,4.825396825396825
3566522,5,B001FAGMO2,Perfect condition as described! Great Seller! Good old films - quality is mediocre because of the age of the films themselves. But it was a good gift for my 90 year old father who lived during this time in Black history.,1381276800,4,220,4.390243902439025

8301456,2,B001FAGMO2,I was excited to get this set and was looking forward to watching these old movies.  The music was good but OMG - the acting was sooo bad.  Couldn't even watch the movies all the way through.  Ended up donating them to Goodwill.,1478822400,,228,4.255813953488372

8301458,5,B001FAGMO2,Some of these are grainy however they are still watchable.  I just love watching old Black American movies and the talent they portrayed.

8301461,5,B001FAGMO2,Great old B&W movies from a time gone by and wonder what could have been if these artists would have been full exposure to early TV. Wonderful stuff.,1439164800,,149,4.357142857142857
