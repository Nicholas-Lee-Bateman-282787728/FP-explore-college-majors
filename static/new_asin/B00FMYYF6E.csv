8617067,4,B00FMYYF6E,"If you have already consumed the four major, multi-part documentaries and are looking for something else, this will satisfy. The maps are good. It is a comprehensive work on WWI but I would start with ""WWI: The Complete Story - 100th Memorial Edition.""",1469059200,,252,4.883720930232558

The title of this documentary can be a little confusing and I can assure you it is entirely a WWI focus, not a history or modern warfare.  The ""100 Years"" refers mainly to the centenary since the start of the war, and a little bit about the lasting effects in the century that followed (the constitution of European countries following the armistice etc...).  It begins explaining the issues and events leading up to war and flows all the way through to the armistice and some of it's consequences.  In that sense, it is a fairly broad overview of the war and fairly good in it's coverage.  That is not to say it is super in depth.  It is better than many documentaries I have seen, but shares a large amount of the exact same footage such as colorized footage I believe was in WWI In Color.  The narration is fairly standard and professional.  It is not as dramatic as some modern documentary styles which is either a plus or minus depending on your tastes.

Here is a recap of the episode titles in a little more condensed version that is hopefully easier to read:

 DISC 1:
 The Road to War
 A Botched Murder
 Schlieffen & His Plan
 The Western Front
 The Eastern Front

 DISC 2:
 Stale mate : Slaughter in the Trenches
 Gallipoli and the Ottoman Empire
 The Slaughter Continues
 The Naval War
 The Emergence of Air Power

DISC 3:
 Revolution : The End of Empires
 America Joins the War
 The Final Year
 Armistice: The Consequences of the Peace

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Though hard core enthusiasts might not find much new here that they didn't already own, this really is not a bad overview of the entire war for someone looking for that sort of thing.  It can be an economical choice if you get a good price, but there are tons of documentaries out there since 2015.  I don't suggest paying more than around $10 and there are other larger sets in that price range at time of writing this review.",1432771200,,1929,4.485549132947977

8617071,5,B00FMYYF6E,This is a very good program. I originally saw it on The Military Channel. It has now been issued as a 3 DVD set (12 episodes) in a commemorative tin case. Highly recommended.,1406505600,2,174,4.303030303030303
