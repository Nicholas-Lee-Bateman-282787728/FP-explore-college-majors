3040509,4,B000ZEC19Y,"The only reason this product didn't get a 5 star rating is because i felt it could have been a bit more in-depth about why certain processes worked the way they did. That said, the descriptions and examples of the processes and examples themselves were extremely easy to understand, and the examples were repeated enough to grasp the nature of the subject. However, it would be impossible to understand what was going on without a solid foundation of elementary algebra, so this DVD would be useless without being familiar with the basic concepts. I haven't seen the beginner algebra DVD by this same company, but if it is anything like this one it should suffice.",1216598400,9,664,4.782608695652174
3040510,4,B000ZEC19Y,"This DVD series is an excellent support for math courses up through Calculus. Is this the right choice for you, though? You must consider whether or not you want to learn mathematics or be entertained.  The presenter is not very entertaining - not boring, but hey, he's trying to present Calculus. Many videos are just a little less expensive but for 30 minute to one hour of instruction. These videos provide several hours of instruction. So $ for $ I found these extremely helpful compared to others.  I watched parts of a different series (from the library) that would cost $29.95 for each 30 minutes... ok, the other series has cool graphics, etc., but $ for $ learning wise this is the way to go.

If you do not have the option of video-recording your professor or having access to other on-line video lectures, this is a great supplement for the serious student who can ignore the speaker continually saying ""ok"" (a bit annoying - 30 times per hour) and who doesn't mind this being essentially a videotaped lecture.

The presentation of the topics is usually pretty clear. It's great being able to rewind sections. I even occasionally ran the DVD at 1.5 and 2X speed to get through review sections faster.

Hopefully in the next several years there will be enough of these presentations on line for free by various professors - but if you're taking a math class now then go for this one today.",1215820800,5,1399,4.647773279352227

You would also need the same company's DVD for precalculus. Another problem is that the instructor doesn't go into nearly enough depth; so unless you already have a solid background in college algebra, you will not pass the CLEP test without a much more rigorous course of study than is possible with these DVDs alone.

8235399,3,B000ZEC19Y,"For the 7 hours he teaches this course, it is good... You get your money's worth.

However, it is not long enough... Not nearly long enough.  If this course is suppose to cover college algebra, then I think in a lot of ways it succeeded, and in a lot of ways, it failed.

There should've been a lot more examples given & worked through.  There should've been a lot more complicated equations to solve, and a lot more advanced manipulation of numbers and variables.

I watched this course 3 whole times before taking a college algebra course... And although it helped me, and it was worth the money,  my college algebra course was a real struggle... There was so much I had to learn in that class & get good at that Jason barely mentioned, or didn't cover at all.

He says in the beginning that this DVD & his others are needed to ""A"" an algebra class... And that's just not true... They'll help a lot, but you'll need a lot more than just his algebra dvds.

For example, he has a section on the standard form for the equation of a circle in this DVD tutor - and he explains it very well! and gives good examples...
However, he doesn't cover hyperbolas, and doesn't cover an ellipse either... Both of which were in my college algebra course.

Even things like Decartes rule of signs was covered in my college algebra course - but it isn't mentioned in this course at all.

College algebra is an advanced subject... Full of tremendous details.  It doesn't make sense to me that this course is only 7 hours long.  Although Jason usually does a great job, in this case, it seemed lazy and rushed.  This course should've easily been over 10 hours long, and even then, it should've been part 1 of a 2 dvd set on Advanced algebra.  He spent a ton of time on his Calculus dvds, so I wonder why he spent so little time on the algebra dvds?  Was he bored?  But after all, algebra IS what makes Calculus so hard for people.

It's an excellent 7 hour course... I think you should buy it.  I just wish it was longer.  I would've gladly paid more money for an extra 3-4 hours.",1469491200,,2062,4.322916666666667
