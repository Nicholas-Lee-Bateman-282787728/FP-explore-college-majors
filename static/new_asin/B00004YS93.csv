1378267,5,B00004YS93,"I watched Voltron as a child.  Even when they show it on the Cartoon Network, I still like the show.  This was the best anime cartoon ever.  I miss those days when you could sit down and watch some good cartoons.  Some of these cartoons they air are sickening in graphics and illustration.  Artists need to look to the past and recreate their cartoons.",1083456000,2,352,4.4375

1378269,4,B00004YS93,"Before ""Anime"" was a household word, kids were tuning in to see the ultimate mecha, Voltron:Defender of the Universe every afternoon. A sort of Holy Grail of an episode is the ""Fleet of Doom"" installment, in which the the Golion (Lion Voltron)team and the DairuggerXV (vehichle Voltron)team up to battle an evil alliance between their respective nemesis, King Hazar, and the Drule Empire. I caught part of it once when I was a kid, and was never able to catch it again. I recently got this tape, however, and it does not dissapoint. Cheesy? Sure. Dated? You bet. Fun? YOU BETTER...BELIEVE IT!I could vege in front of this wonderful escapist fare for hours right now, just as easily as I did all those years ago. In fact, I think I'll order a few more tapes and do just that.",1032480000,14,774,4.575539568345324
1378270,5,B00004YS93,"This 2 hour made-for-television ""Voltron"" movie debuted near the end of Voltron's original run in late 1986 (it even aired on primetime where I lived!). In this sequence, (animated for American audiences) both the Lion and Vehicle Force Voltrons are featured, and they join up to battle King Zarkon and Prince Lotor's ""Fleet Of Doom"". In my humble opinion, the animation and music from this special (along with the 2nd season of the Lion Force Voltron) does not measure up to the original animation of Golion and Dairugger XV, the anime that the Voltron series was based on.
However, it is very cool to see the casts of both versions of the Voltron series interacting for the first time onscreen. For those who want to discover the magic of the Voltron series for the first time, I highly recommend starting with the original five episodes of the Lion Force Voltron, sometimes available as ""Castle Of Lions"", or on Amazon you will find at least the four of the first five episodes on ""Vol 2: Space Explores Captured"" and ""Vol. 3: A Ghost & Four Keys"".
Thanks for reading!

the menu looks nice
the blooper reel is pointless
nice to have a episode of lion force and a episode of vehicle force on it
sound is pretty good on the release

my gripes about this dvd is why is it so grainy?its say all new remastered film transfer.looks like it is untouched i have seen bootleg dvd versions look better than this from back in the day.
it is watchable don't get me wrong just wonder why it says remastered when clearly it is not.
the he man cartoons from 1983 on dvd looked better than this.

This short movie involves the traditional lion team Voltron meeting up with the Voltron made of, basically, cars and helicopters and battling against a horde of monsters...and even an evil Voltron-type monster. The picture quality is much what one would expect from a 30 year old tv special. The audio is just alright. Nothing amazing. Certainly not up to the standards of the incredible tin cased sets of the tv series.

(armadillo) Final fleet battle could have been better. I think the vehicle voltron episode where they cleaned house at the robeast garaqge was far better.,1261180800,,308,5.717391304347826
1378302,5,B00004YS93,"I don't think the other reviews of this product are very fair.

The picture and sound quality on this release is definetly superior to the previous release which was by the way was just a limited edition that WEP released themselves.

Media Blasters gave this feature the same respect they gave the rest of the Voltron series from Lion force to Vehicle force.

Before you go unfairly bashing this product, remember how crappy the first DVD release was. (The sound was the main issue)

If you as a collector or a casual fan want a really great copy of this special on DVD, this version is the one to get.

Stay away from the previous release at all costs.",1255132800,13,654,4.46218487394958
1378303,2,B00004YS93,"I love Voltron. I watched it everyday in the 80's and when it came out on dvd I even took the discs with me to Iraq for 14 months. I knew the 2 Voltrons met at some point and when this dvd was released I acted like a maniac waiting for it to come in the mail. I am so disappointed. The animation work is lacking in many scenes and the plot is open ended and mild. The robeasts in this episode are some of the lousiest ever: a rhinobeast, a flimsy scorpionbeast, an armadillobeast!? and a beetle? You can't be serious. Did Lotor visit his first zoo enroute? The vehicle voltron series had some pretty wicked and impressive robeasts. Surely they weren't all destroyed. Even Hagars creations were finer stock than a freakin armadillo beast. In the end Zarkon and the Drules are still around. Lotor combines his roadkill/safari beasts to form a giant ""zoobeast"" which he controls from within the head. Of course he escapes just as the 2 voltrons cut through it. Overall I felt that it was happy hour somewhere and the creators just through some stuff together and called it quits. It gets 1 star because its Voltron and another star because you are required to have this in your Voltron collection.",1250553600,4,1194,4.506912442396313
1378304,2,B00004YS93,"Voltron: Fleet of Doom is a one-hour special where the Lion Force Voltron team and the Vehicle Voltron team come together to fight an alliance between Planet Doom and the Drule Empire.  While this is supposed to be the premise, the two Voltrons and their respective pilots don't spend a lot of screen time together.  Much more emphasis is placed on the Lion Force Voltron characters, especially on a sub-plot concerning Zarkon's witch, Haggar, stealing Princess Allura's soul and Keith having to go into a ""dream dimension"" to save her.  While the idea of having the two Voltrons teaming up together is an interesting one, the potential for this idea is never fully realized within this story.

World Events Productions self-released the DVD for Fleet of Doom.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with this release.  There was a poor job done on the audio mastering; while the dialogue can be heard clearly, the background music and sound effects are soft and mixed so far into the background, that it can be hard to hear them.  Also, unlike the other Voltron DVD releases, significant ""dead space"" is left between the ""bumps"" for the commercial breaks; this ""dead space"" really hurts the flow of the special.

There are five special features included on the Fleet of Doom DVD release.  The first is ""Character/Vehicle Slide Show.""  This slide show combines production art and stills from both Vehicle Voltron and Lion Force Voltron, with some token shots from Fleet of Doom.  However, the viewer has no way of controlling when the pictures change, and the slideshow runs for way too long (especially for a slideshow that doesn't have any background music included).  This feature would have been stronger if it had been shorter, and put more focus on Fleet of Doom.

The next feature is ""Original Series Openers.""  This feature plays the openings for Lion Force Voltron and Vehicle Voltron back-to-back, instead of giving the viewer a menu and allowing the viewer to choose which opener they want to see.  ""Man on the Street"" is the exact same special feature that appeared on the Voltron Volume 4 set.  The ""Fan Films"" feature takes the ""Fan Films"" feature from the Voltron Volume 3 set, but removes the music video and replaces it with two new fan films not in the original special feature.  The final extra is ""Other WEP Cartoons"" (promos for the other animated programming that World Events Productions released).

I would only recommend Fleet of Doom for die-hard Voltron fans who have to own every Voltron-related DVD release.",1239667200,,2544,4.918032786885246

1378312,2,B00004YS93,"I have to agree with Brian's comments.  I only wish I had read it PRIOR to ordering this catastrophe of a DVD.  The only reason I didn't give it a rating of 1 is because of the simple fact that it is a great ""movie"", and to rate it based on the quality alone would be unjust.  Now here's my two cents on this release.  The quality of the video and audio both reminded me of an old school ""Laserdisc"" that is suffering from extreme laser ROT.  And Brian wasn't kidding when he referred to the EXTREMELY annoying 15 second or greater ""fade to black"" that seems to last an eternity during what apparently is supposed to be a ""commercial break"".  It reminded me of when I watched it back in the 80's on regular broadcast television.  The thing that I REALLY regret, is parting with my mint condition VHS of the same title.  I hate to say this, but the VHS was far SUPERIOR to this pathetic excuse for a DVD.  There was no 15 second lag between ""breaks"".  In fact it was a very well edited and smooth running ""movie"".  Not to mention there was an additional episode ta boot.  I shudder to think how they will translate ""Voltron I"" (Vehicle Force) and of course ""Dairugger XV"" (Original Vehicle Force), the ones that we really want to see anyhow, because we all know the Vehicle Force was FAR superior to the Lion Force *lol*.  Hopefully enough of us fans will send WEP enough ""hate mail"" and they will actually listen and give this classic feature the remaster treatment and 5.1 audio mix that is well deserved!  I really could care less about extra features, I just want a smooth running DVD translation without black screens that is at least on par with the VHS.  Luckily I was able to track down an unopened VHS of it online for a fair price.  At this point, the VHS translation is the way to go.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!

Whom ever ""Quote un Quote"" was the video editor for this release should be at the very least harshly reprimanded for his or her incompetency! The other five Voltron releases have an awful lot of grain and video noise as well as some obvious synchronicity issues but this one is just an absolute abomination!
The very first thing you see are the trailers for other WEP releases
 this is standard procedure and thus it is expected. These trailers are were you first notice the awful quality of this DVD release! The first preview looks like a very bad MPEG 4 video with lots of distortion. Can you say very low bit rate I can! NOT A GOOD START! The second preview is much worse! The tracking was very clearly off on there tape machine you can even spot the tape counter very briefly! Obviously NO body bothered to check the quality of this disc! The show it's self has some very notable problems as well. First the video is quite grainy and horribly out of sync. Unlike all the other Voltron releases there is NO 5.1 surround mix sound option! The most annoying thing about this slapped together pile of dung is the massively long black screens when the program goes to the Voltron will be right back bit. I kid you not there is a 15 second black screen before you see the we now return to Voltron image! This is unacceptably incompetent of there editing staff!
The special Voltron on the streets bonus feature has horrid tracking it is bouncing all around. HELLO THIS IS DVD NOT VHS!  If you are looking to complete your Voltron collection this is a start. Mind you not a very damn good one! If the Vehicle Force gets this kind of asinine treatment I will be returning it as defective. I spent $25.00 for a sucker punch in the face disguised as a fond childhood memory!

Since Voltron is currently off Cartoon Network and has yet to be released in DVD in the US (keeping fingers crossed about a imminent DVD release) do yourself a favor and pick up this tape so you can see how this timeless classic all began.  Thumbs up!",1113696000,2,689,4.229007633587786
1378319,5,B00004YS93,"When you watch Voltron you get transported back to a time when cartoons were truly fantastic and yet had a realism to them.  The bad guys were not just laughing buffoons (although there were some of those as well), but were truly out to harm and yes even kill (good heavens!) the good guys or innocent by-standers.

The good guys were often outnumbered and out-gunned but were willing to sacrifice themeselves anyway inorder to save innocent lives.  In other words they were hero's in the classic sense.  This was a very simple plot line by today's standards (which are basically soap-opera's),  and yet I could not but feel uplifted at the end of each episode.  These were also excellent examples of good role model behavior for young developing minds.  Not to mention that it encouraged a interest in science education and space exploration.",1098748800,2,843,4.853146853146853
1378320,5,B00004YS93,"Summery:

An anime made in the early 80s that has a very strong 70s Shoujo look to it. No matter how much of an a-hole Prince Shinkurain (Shinclyn aka LOTOR) is, the girls always pick him as favorite character. Princess Faara (Phahra aka Allura) has a bit more girl-power thing going for her than most girls in a fighting series. The actual Golion (Voltron) piolots are rather irritating.

SUGGESTION: Wait a few more months untill it comes out on DVD format or just get the Australian DVD & an all-reag. player, not only will you get to watch it in both languages (there are more eppisodes in Japanese) but pricewise, you get alot more for the DVD.",1096416000,2,649,4.538461538461538

There are not much extras to speak of and no additional inserts that come with the dvd.",1451174400,,362,4.5
