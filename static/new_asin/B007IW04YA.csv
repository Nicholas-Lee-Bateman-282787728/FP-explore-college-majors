8518048,5,B007IW04YA,I have been in love with the poetry of Nikki Giovanni since the 70's. My students love this interview. They also love her poetry with Bernard Diggs and the NY Community Choir.,1395360000,,175,4.5
8518049,5,B007IW04YA,"She's at it again!  I really enjoyed this conversation between Moyers and Nikki.  Bill had all the right questions and Nikki had the answers.  Watching them took me back to when Nikki came to Borders Bookstore in Downtown Chicago to promote her book Sacred Cows and Other Edibles.  She is truly a genuine person---and a real regular folk.  Nikki's books and CD/DVDs are the only ones that rival my collection of Maya Angelou works.  I am very glad to have them both.  Thanks!....ladies

DVD quality: Excellent.",1361404800,,510,4.848837209302325
