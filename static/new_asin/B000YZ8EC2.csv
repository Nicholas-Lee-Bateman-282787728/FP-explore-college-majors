First and foremost, this is a Dead Guys Cinema production. This is a company that specializes in ""guys-in-peril"" horror movies, a response, if you will, to the endless ""girls-in-peril"" horror films that are made.

With a Dead Guys Cinema film, you know exactly what you are getting: it is going to be a very-low budget film, without an intelligent plot or good writing, with guys in underwear and maybe so nudity -- and really fake deaths. In addition this film was directed by Alex Dove, who has done a number of guys-getting-killed film. Thus means the movie is likely going to get at its very best, a 2-star rating.

I bought this film at another website, at a cheaper price. I have a number of factors I consider when buying a film: the quality of the film, the length of it, the price, and how much it is something I really want to see and own.

I took these factors into consideration when buying this film. One of the things that made me decide to buy it, even though I knew it would be a bad (not even camp!) film was that the production information said it was 120 minutes long.

THIS IS A LIE. I just watched the film and it does NOT even last *45* MINUTES!

I think I know exactly what Dead Guys Cinema did when they sent out this product information film. They included in the overall length of the film the ""Extras"". This included over 20 minutes of ""Extended Death Scenes"" (oh, joy) and ""Trailers"", the trailers being not normal trailers, but just long, long, boring, single segments from their various movies that ran for anywhere from 5 minutes long. These were *not* trailers.

Adding the length of Extras to the length of the actual movie is just a cheat and a rip-off. I have never seen this done before by a production company and I hope never to see it again!

There isn't even *any* mention of the length of the film on the DVD's cover either.

I've submitted a production information correction of the time-length to Amazon and am now writing this review. Hopefully whoever might comes along that might even vaguely consider buying this film will see the *CORRECT* length of 45 minutes and *not* 120 minutes.

I am also contacting every website I can find that sells THE HANDYMAN and letting them know its *real* length.

Finally, I called the company I bought my copy of the DVD from and asked for a refund, explaining to them the rip-off.  They had absolutely no problem in giving me a refund for it.",1204156800,2,2573,4.451063829787234
