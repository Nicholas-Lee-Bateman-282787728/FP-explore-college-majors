3171293,4,B0017CW5TE,"This double feature dvd is a steal.  I highly recommend it to any 80's slasher fans.  Lets take a look at the two movies that are featured.

MY BLOODY VALENTINE:  It's what horror movies aren't anymore.  I found this movie entertaining from beginning to end,it never dragged on.  A tragic mining accident leaves only one survivor.  This miner hates Valentines Day with a passion and will kill everyone who dares even hang a paper heart outside.  The fun begins human hearts are being sent out in candy boxes with an eerie warning never to have the towns Valentine dance.  While the dance is canceled in fear of the townspeople's safety they decide to have a Valentines party instead,and everyone gets picked off one by one.  Boiled hearts and a dead body in a dryer make this a favorite of mine.

APRIL FOOLS DAY:  Not as good as ""My Bloody Valentine"" but it's a decent film for anyone's budget.  And buying the double feature saves you money as opposed to buying the movies separately.  It has a decent body count.  I like the scene near the beginning where the ferry crushes the side of a guys face.  Overall good mystery film.  Give this set a try.",1246320000,,1151,4.536585365853658
3171294,5,B0017CW5TE,The shipping on this was great. Got it within 6 days after I ordered it. The DVD was flawless. I'll definately order from them again.,1241395200,,133,4.36
3171295,1,B0017CW5TE,"This is the worst sub company I've ever purchased from. I ordered this dvd on Feb. 21st. its now April 6th. and I still haven't received the dvd yet. I wrote to the company and was told that they sent it by UPS, which I think is BS cause I received every movie I've ordered except this one.",1238976000,,290,4.017241379310345
3171296,1,B0017CW5TE,I have not received the movie's yet!  I'm still waiting.. DVDlegacy hasn't answered my emails!  I want my movies!,1237939200,,113,4.894736842105263
3171297,4,B0017CW5TE,"First off I have to state that I'm one of the cheapest S.O.B.'s around these parts(at least that's what my friends and family say!), so when you see the 4 star rating for this double feature of mediocre slasher fare you can be rest assured that it gets extra marks for costing me a measley $7.00 brand new and not because I in any way believe that these are ""the greatest films from the Slasher Frenzy Era that ran amok during the mid seventies to mid eighties(as quoted from a fellow reviewer here).""  These movies are far from slasher heaven(with Halloween and Black Christmas), but then again they aren't deserving of slasher hell either(with Driller Killer and every Hollywood slasher remake)... let's just put them comfortably in slasher purgatory where they belong(with House On Sorority Row and Maniac Cop).  My Bloody Valentine tells the tale of a town cursed to never celebrate Valentines Day again without unleashing the wrath of a miner who was the only survivor in a horrible accident that happened years ago on that day.  The premise is laughable in that all they have to do is NOT celebrate Valentines Day(at least on February 14th) and nobody dies... but apparently they love the holiday so much that they just can't resist-- do real people even celebrate Valentines Day?!  Anyhow, they throw a Valentines dance even with the possibility of certain doom and the slashing begins.  My Bloody Valentine plays like a slightly(and I do mean slightly, no gore here at all) edgier episode of Scooby Doo with the eventual unmasking of the ""evil miner"" by a hero who even dresses like Shaggy from the cartoon(I'm talking shirt open from the belly-button up with a scarf!).  A decent time waster though, with solid acting and a few nice moments of tension (a big budget remake is in production... because an 11 year old in Calgary demanded it LOL!).  April Fools Day(which has already had it's awful remake released) is the other movie included here and is the far better of the 2 films.  It starts with a group of college students heading out to a friends isolated island home to celebrate April Fools Day(again, do you know ANYONE who actually celebrates this?!).  A horrible tragedy takes place as soon they reach the island(the ferryman has his head crushed against the dock by the boat!) and shortly thereafter people begin getting slashed.  April Fools Day is a film that I absolutely loathed as a youth, with a finale that had me nearly to the point of putting my head through the TV screen... now that I'm older though, I can actualy appreciate the movies desire to deliver something original as well as some of the cheeky charm that when I was a kid I couldn't pick up on.  The movie also has a great cast and good direction throughout.  So like I said before, this double feature is a nice slice of slasher purgatory in that it probably won't wow you, but both films still deliver most of what a genre fan is after.  The DVD from Lionsgate is very good with both films shown in the Widescreen format with Dolby audio(though the levels seemed lower on My Bloody Valentine).",1221696000,11,3087,4.683918669131239
3171298,3,B0017CW5TE,"I have seen April Fools Day and like it very much, but I have not seen My Bloody Valentine, but thats not the reason I write this.

3171299,3,B0017CW5TE,"my bloody valentine is a pretty good generic slasher movie. set in a mining town, the final scenes in the mine with the mad killer on his rampage are quite effective. unfortunately the movie has been cut to get a very tame R rating. i liked it anyway. april fool's day on the other hand stinks. a bunch of rich college punks go to a mansion on a cut off island (no phones etc). they start getting knocked off one by one. suspicion falls on the host muffy. or is it her mad sister buffy? i won't give away the ending but i hated it. so, this dvd is two movies for the price of one. i liked one and hated the other. but who knows, maybe you'll like april fools day and hate my bloody valentine. at 7.49 i recommend it. it was pretty good fun. 3 and 1/2 stars.",1219622400,,757,4.0198675496688745
3171300,5,B0017CW5TE,"""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""April Fool's Day"" are two of the greatest films from the Slasher Frenzy Era that ran amok during the mid seventies to mid eighties.  Also, they are among my collection of holiday slasher fare.  Both are superb mysteries and both take place in creepy, isolated locales.

  In ""My Bloody Valentine,"" someone has been hurt by a past tragedy and will stop at nothing to prevent the annual Valentine's dance from taking place in their little mining town.  They will even rip out someone's heart and send it to the sheriff or stuff the dance's organizer into a dryer.  Rebellious high school friends boldly go to the mine where they are axed to death one by one.  This is a very creepy atmospheric thriller with quite a few gory death sequences.

  In ""April Fool's Day,"" a group of college friends descend on a rich friend's retreat on an isolated island.  There is an accident on the ferry; someone is badly disfigured.  Soon holiday pranks turn to holiday murders as one by one the friends begin to disappear.  Survivors frantically search for clues while the killer slashes their way through the guest list.  In order to keep the killer's identity a secret, most of the killings are done off screen.  If you like the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, you will enjoy ""April Fool's Day"" because the directors are the same and they share that outdoor woodsy atmosphere.

  ""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""April Fool's Day"" are extremely enjoyable.  This DVD is a great value and is highly recommended for those who enjoy good mysteries and/or good holiday slasher fare.  Note:  The title of my review is from the poster for my favorite slasher, ""The House That Screamed.""  It was too appropriate to resist.",1216080000,,1715,4.758503401360544

April Fool's Day had a beautiful cheese factor to it (which I adored) but it was a bit too creepy for it's time. The actors were very attractive and provocative. The language and innuendo was extreme, but the violence and gore was low!

MY Bloody Valentine had a boring plot and I found myself snoring throughout. The film had a disturbingly stupid opening and the ending results in the same manner. Very predictable. The Unrated/Uncut version may be best, but please pass up the TV-PG Version!
