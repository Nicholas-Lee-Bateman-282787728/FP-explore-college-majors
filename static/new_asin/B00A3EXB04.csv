5381206,5,B00A3EXB04,"""Things We Don't Talk About"" is a must-see for anyone interested in feminism, women's empowerment, or honoring the divine in women. It shines a light on what is possible when we dare to envision and create a women's culture based not on media or the marketplace, but instead rooted in authenticity, support, empowerment, and sovereignty. The director has beautifully captured the essence of the Red Tent movement and the depth of the healing that occurs within this special space. The documentary storytelling is so rich that every time I view this film I laugh, cry, and notice something new that I didn't see or hear before.

I own a copy of the DVD and have attended many screenings, even hosting one in my hometown. The screening was very well attended (80 women) and has helped launch a monthly Red Tent in our community. I highly recommend this film. It's something you'll want to share with your mother, sister, auntie, friends, and neighbors.",1390867200,6,950,4.864197530864198
5381207,3,B00A3EXB04,I was suggested this video as an outline for a Goddess group I started.  It was more of an informercial style.  I did a lot of my own leg work to set up my group.,1389830400,,162,3.6
5381208,5,B00A3EXB04,"I have watched this movie five times because my non profit, The Red Web Foundation, hosted multiple screenings. Each time I watched it I heard and saw new things in it, and I enjoyed it differently with each viewing. Like most women, a lot of my time is spent caring for others and the profound sharing among the women in the movie really touched that deep part within that yearns for more time in circles of women. The film is beautifully produced, showing women of all walks of life and all stages of life, laughing, crying, dancing and sharing. The film helped me get in touch with that part of me that needs more women in my life. I highly recommend it to all women.",1385510400,9,670,4.368
5381209,4,B00A3EXB04,"'Things We Don't Talk About' is exactly what we should be talking about.  This is a documentary that captures the importance of sharing life stories among women about being female.  The Red Tent movement honors the woman's journey - the physical changes and emotional complexities.  For many women, the 'sharings' in this movie are the first to be spoken and acknowledged in their own lives - not previous talked about by a mother, sister, or female friend.  The opportunity to watch this film with other women and then talk about it, invites a richness for all in attendance, a deepening of each one's own honoring of her body and her story.  Let me quickly add, this is an important film for men to watch as it helps them to better understand and love the women in their lives. Film director, Isadora Leidenfrost's caring approach in capturing these stories is such a gift!

5381211,5,B00A3EXB04,"A synopsis of a current movement growing among women, which presents different ways women can nurture each other, and help each other work out healing ways to be with each other.  Real women of all ages talking about real experiences.  Not polished, and that ads to its value for me.  Enjoy!

5381212,3,B00A3EXB04,"It has nothing to do with Sean Connery. It also has very little to do with Anita Diamant's novel.  This DVD is the launch site for a women's cultural movement, arguing that women need--and deserve--cultural spaces where we are free to recharge and celebrate ourselves and our experiences. Networking and building these communities creates protections making women less vulnerable to exploitation and violence.

Filmmaker Isadora Leidenfrost has little use for mythologizing traditions which did not exist. She is helping today's women create a world which celebrates our sense of self. As part of her academic work, this DVD was carefully researched.

Women from all backgrounds were interviewed about intensely personal life stories. We see how they are affected by society. But then how the sisterhood of the red tent gives them the chance to affect society. There is a process. Watching this alone, or especially with a group, is a moving experience. And I did have fun at the local women's gathering where this film was shown.

The only reason why I was not crazy about the movie was in fact that it seemed to do very little with menstruation at all, when advertizing outreach materials around the area themselves seemed to promote this. Better rewrite?",1367712000,3,1257,5.087378640776699
8546464,5,B00A3EXB04,"I found a Red Tent group soon after this and it is an amazing experience that all women should have. As a mother, it is something I've suggested to all 5 of my daughters and their friends, and reminiscent of the days when large, close-knot families brought up and educated their daughters together. Highly recommended!",1468886400,2,318,4.8
8546465,5,B00A3EXB04,"Makes me cry every time. If you are a woman, love a woman, or know a woman, you need to watch this movie. We need to own our power as Goddesses and take back the sacred feminine. This is a life changing experience, y'all.",1465257600,3,221,4.045454545454546
8546466,5,B00A3EXB04,"I watched the the movie ""The Red Tent"" and loved it, so I decided to give the documentary a try. I was not disappointed. It was very good",1450396800,,137,3.9285714285714284
8546467,5,B00A3EXB04,"For me, it was a great movie. It helped me to feel as though I am not alone in my feelings. Sometimes when we are in our deepest pain it can feel like the darkest place in the world.",1445731200,,182,3.6923076923076925

8546470,1,B00A3EXB04,I did not particularly like this film.  It felt surfacy and only got deep a couple of times.  I feel it was well intentioned but did not accomplish anything.,1433894400,,157,4.379310344827586

8546472,1,B00A3EXB04,"It was more about hippies in tents with feel good messages. I thought it was going to have something to do with the book, The Red Tent. It's basically a bunch of women getting together with crystals and other new agey practices while honoring your menstrual cycle. I'm not against that, but I was hoping this was going to have something to do WITH the book itself and it didn't. The idea these women took is from the book, but it's their spin on things.",1425168000,,453,4.341176470588235
8546473,3,B00A3EXB04,Not really a must see for men.  Kept waiting for something pithy I had not learned in 75 years of living with 5 sisters and 6 daughters. Clearly meant to make the subjects but not the audience feel significant.,1419292800,,210,4.384615384615385
