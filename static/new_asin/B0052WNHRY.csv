8454603,3,B0052WNHRY,"I came across this from a blip on youtube only latter to find out that there was a full length film called Phantom Pain. As a lover of foreign films reading the subtitles was par of the course, no problem there. My reference that this film has a little bit of everything is related to sports as he is a biker, he has a complicated relation with his ex-wife, young daughter and the new wife's lover who is the main character best friend/employer-sponsor, the new love in his life, and on top of all that he looses his leg in an accident!

I think I watched it one and half times to make sure I got all of the nuances. It was a good watch!",1361923200,,637,4.096

This one succeeds.
 I watched ""Phantom Pain"" over two nights. Til Sweiger is a very handsome man. It's interesting and compelling watching such a devil-may-care guy fall apart when he is run down by a car while tootling home on his Vespa.
I must confess that I was run down by a car one night. I had decided to go out jogging to improve my health. It made the movie very powerful for me.

Til's character has to choose whether to die or have his leg amputated. Under the persuasion of his friend and daughter, he chooses to live. And then he goes through some very hard times alone in his bed racked with pain. He survives all this and with the help of his friend gets a new mechanical leg.  Very confronting and inspiring for this fellow. I let go a big sigh when it ended.",1325203200,,839,4.264150943396227
