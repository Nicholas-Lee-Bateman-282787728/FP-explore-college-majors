2308682,3,B0009PAQNW,"Compared to other Colin Firth movies, this movie was very flat. I love period movies, and comparing to the likes of Jane Austin, this one pales in comparison. I had higher hopes for this film so was disappointed when I finished watching it.
The character of Camille was not well formed. She gave a sub-par performance. Firth seemed stilted and robotic at times.
The story line was a good one, and the potential for it being much more fleshed out would have made it much more endearing. So, it left me feeling like I wasted 100 minutes of my day.
So, chalk it up to one not so hot purchase.
I'll loan it to my daughter, with whom I LOVE to watch movies like this, but with a forwarning not to expect too much.
I would recommend saving the $$$ and watching Pride and Prejudice again!",1294704000,197,781,4.3561643835616435
2308683,5,B0009PAQNW,"Beautiful love storey with Greta Scacchi and Colin Firth.  They work beautifully together and the film is a delight to watch.  Its a simple story yet tragic...

Great to see an very under valued Greta Scacchi work as she is a class actress.",1291507200,103,240,4.534883720930233
2308684,4,B0009PAQNW,The movie was good by tv movie standards.  I liked seeing the young Colin Firth overacting in spots but all in all not bad.  Ben Kingsley was very good in the role of the father and would later work again with Firth in the Last Legion.,1231200000,,235,4.086956521739131

2308686,1,B0009PAQNW,"I love to watch Colin Firth act so I bought this tape, twice.

The first purchase was labeled as used, but the quality was terrible.  It looked like someone had taped it from the tv, stopping at commercials, and then made hundreds of copies. This tape being the hundred and first incarnation.  So when it showed up in an auction as ""New"" I hoped for a better quality video.  Nope.  Poor quality just like the other.

His hopes,dreams, commitment to both, are very good.",1402444800,,313,4.607142857142857

2308732,1,B0009PAQNW,"I am a big fan of Colin Firth, and before I saw this, I could not imagine how any movie in which he is a romantic and devoted lover could be bad.  The movie is loaded with great talents but that does not stop it from being dull.

Its weak script fails to persuade that the courtesan is tragic or that her young man is madly in love with her. The country girl runs away from the cruel father who mistreats her and, after some rough bumps in the city, stumbles upon a rich nobleman who wishes to treat her like a daughter. Although she appreciates his help and likes him, she chooses to be a courtesan. A different script could have made her choice seem interesting and conflicted rather than simply stupid. She also meets Armand, who is young and beautiful. Unfortunately, he is not quite rich enough to take her away from this life that she has chosen, much as he wishes he could.

Perhaps we are supposed to conclude that she receives what she needs too late and she is in too deep to be saved by love. But I found this telling of the classic story so irritating that just throwing the DVD into a trash bin was not enough. Hence, this review and the warning. Bad movie. Bad, boring movie.",1380412800,6,1189,4.275555555555556

2308735,3,B0009PAQNW,"Don't look for P & P in this, as the cover portrays that romantic feel. it was a good enough watch for a rainy Sunday afternoon with nothing else to do. Colin Firth is VERY young in this movie, so if you are looking for the older, more distinguished look, you will be disheartened",1375056000,2,280,4.203703703703703
2308736,3,B0009PAQNW,This is a rather odd film. I didn't really like the leading lady but who can resist Colin Firth. The leading lady is very flakey.,1374710400,2,129,4.2
2308747,2,B0009PAQNW,I did not care for this story at all.  I love Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice so purchased this thinking it would be another great movie with him.  But I did not like the story at all and couldn't even finish watching the movie because I dislike it so much.  Would not recommend.,1373932800,4,282,4.185185185185185

2308749,1,B0009PAQNW,The acting was wooden and amateurish like a high school production. This movie did not resemble the product description. It was so bad that I only watched half the movie. Boy was I  duped.,1364083200,2,188,4.529411764705882

2308751,3,B0009PAQNW,I was expecting more drama and mystery with such a good actor like Colin Firth.  The story lacked intrigue and romance.,1361491200,,119,4.666666666666667

2308753,1,B0009PAQNW,This was depressing and I did not like this movie.  It's one of those story lines that you hope will get better by the end and it did not.  Disappointed.,1359936000,,153,4.066666666666666
2308754,2,B0009PAQNW,I walked away from this movie before seeing the ending.  It was boring.  I did not like the sappy character Colin Firth played or the unfeeling tramp Camille was portrayed as.  I gotta fall in love with someone in the story in order for the love story to make me feel the passion.  Can I send it back for The Birds?,1358640000,2,315,4.114754098360656
2308755,3,B0009PAQNW,"I remember seeing this on tv when it first came out. My impression then was that Scacchi was a horrible actress who just sat on screen trying to look pretty. I had forgotten that Firth was also in it, so I'd say his performance was forgettable.

My tastes have changed so I was hoping that my take on the movie would also change. I love Dumas and know this to be a great story; however, this presentation of it falls short of the book. The movie lacks emotion. The viewer never gets a sense of Camille's motivation. She never becomes a sympathetic character. There is also very little chemistry between Firth and Scacchi. As the story relies on these two loving each other, this is a big blot on the enjoyment of the film.",1358121600,2,722,4.388059701492537
2308756,5,B0009PAQNW,"I like period stuff so this fit the bill.  Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors and I buy anything he is in.

2308768,2,B0009PAQNW,"I am so grateful that Colin Firth became such a well loved acting figure. If he had stayed in the level he had achieved in Camille, he would be broke today. Yes, he was young, but there had to be better young actors at the time. I have a feeling he was chosen for this role because he was then, as he is now, mesmerising to look at.",1355011200,,332,3.8970588235294117

2308771,4,B0009PAQNW,"(Spoilers ahead) I have waited for many years to see this on DVD and was elated to see it released in 2011.  I agree that the film did not fully exploit the talents of the superb cast, but the costumes and sets are well done, and--most of all--the story is true the fictionalized life of Marie Duplessis (by Alexandre Dumas the younger), the Parisian courtesan who died of tuberculosis in the early 1840s at the age of 23. (For opera lovers, this same story was turned into ""La Traviata."")

The reviewers who were ""shocked"" by the ""immorality"" evidently needed a lesson in history.  This film is a period piece.  The protagonist Marguerite was a courtesan--essentially a high-class prostitute.  What did they expect?  She was a ""companion"" for men of the upper-crust whose time was paid for in money, jewelry and other expensive gifts.

As a made-for-TV film of the 1980s, the budget (as mentioned) is not as lavish as a film from the silver screen, but the film still conveys the life of the aristocracy (the young lover was a duke and the son of a duke) and the demimonde in Paris of the mid-19th century.

If you are a fan of literature of the Romantic period or enjoy costumed films, you will enjoy this.",1346889600,15,1208,4.586046511627907

2308774,3,B0009PAQNW,"This movie is only interesting for seeing a young Colin Firth. ""The world's greatest romance"" quote on the cover is misleading. The film/video quality is poor. The story is kind of flat and overall the characters failed to get an attachment out of this viewer. Maybe the book is better, since it is by Alexandre Dumas. I doubt I would recommend this to anyone, but it is watchable if you're interested. Be prepared for a bit of immorality.",1324857600,,439,4.641025641025641
2308775,1,B0009PAQNW,I love Colin Firth so I bought this movie but was very disappointed in this movie.  Music was bad because it is an old movie so I kind of expected that but the acting was sub-par also.,1324598400,2,184,3.972972972972973

2308807,2,B0009PAQNW,"I ordered the movie, Camille, because I love the actor, Colin Firth.  He was very young in this movie.  It was a beautiful period piece. But, O my, the plot was lame.  Ben Kingsley and Greta Scacchi were wonderful, but you knew what was going to happen almost from the beginning. Next time, I order a movie I will do some research before I buy it.

I love the opera stories, including this one, which is the same story as Verdi's Traviata. I enjoyed the lead actors, particularly Colin Firth. It was a sweet movie in many ways, and it was fun to see those particular actors when they were so young.

I didn't like this drama because all the main actress did all through the movie was sleep with different men who could give her money or take care of her financially so she could move up in the world.

2308812,3,B0009PAQNW,"This is an average period piece with good actors and a passable plot.  What I found really ""wrong"" with this production is that it was made in 1984 and movies have come a very long way since then.  The scenery is nice and the costumes are beautiful, but the acting is a little cheesy and so is the music constantly swelling to a crecendo in the background.  The love scenes completely lack passion.  We've come to expect a lot more of Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley since the 80's and this was a bit of a letdown.",1299542400,5,511,4.237113402061856

2308827,4,B0009PAQNW,"I have been a Colin Firth admirer ever since seeing ""Pride & Prejudice"" on Masterpiece Classics, whether in a drama or comedy. I've purchased many of his old - and new - CD's and DVD's and enjoyed them all He is one of those actors who can bring to life whichever character he is portraying. ""Camile"" is one of those earlier movies of his which I enjoyed. I thought the rest of the actors were well cast, also.
Having seen ""The King's Speech"" this year, I look forward to the Academy Awards and Colin Firth winnihg the Oscsr. It will be certainly well deserved! If he doesn't win, it will be a travesty in justice again. I felt he should have won for ""The Single Man"" last year.",1298246400,5,678,4.3046875

This is not what one expects from a traditional period film. The acting was not that great.

The costumes, especially the men's hats, were cheesy and off-putting.  The writing and direction and production are below average.
Instead of this DVD, I recommend the wonderful Franco Zeferilli version of the opera starring Placido Domingo and the lovely Teresa Stratas.  Search on Amazon is:  Verdi: La Traviata Teresa Stratas.

She ""enjoys being a girl"" and we find ourselves naturally forgiving her for that. But the same can't be said for Colin Firth. He seems too young and immature for the part, and in more ways than one. Perhaps those of us who were impressed by his superb performance in ""Dorian Gray"" are being unjust in expecting more from his character who seems uncomfortable from the start. He seems unable to feel and experience the profound love that is really there in Camillle,  judging it by his own experience of ""loving her"". If he had, he would never have believed that her ""leaving"" him was in fact a betrayal of true love.
