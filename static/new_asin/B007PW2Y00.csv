8520774,5,B007PW2Y00,"When you find a movie that is easy on your ears and on your eyes, it makes you want to watch it again and again. Panda is a good DVD movie to watch without ALL the hard core action. It also teaches us about Life. Like helping one another, being kind to each other, no matter what. Thank You Amazon for entertaining me. GOD BLESS YOU.

8520775,2,B007PW2Y00,"this is a short ""2-D"" cartoon, not a 3d and not a group of 5-6 episodes, just the one.

8520776,5,B007PW2Y00,"That's right, 2D animated. Despite the cover including the 3D masters Ox, Rhino and Croc, they are 100% 2D in this Kung Fu Panda short. Featuring the delicious art style of the 2D sequences from the Kung Fu Panda films, this is a very enjoyable 20 minute short centering on three very likeable characters.

Rhino, Ox and Croc are three wayward street fighters with no real ambitions asides from gold and glory. That is, until Oogway (yes, Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda) sees their potential and asks them to stop three fiendish cat sisters who are planning to join all the criminal gangs to take over China. Our three would-be heroes are only persuaded by the lure of riches, but as we find out, each has real reasons, decency and will to do good.

Secrets of the Masters crams appeal by the bucketloads into its short running time. For one thing, it looks fantastic. The art direction and animation are both beyond beautiful. The story is also very well told. The three main characters are also very likeable and bounce off each other well, and their growth as characters is believable and feels natural. Not a dud element in sight.

I should note that Po only appears at the beginning and end of the film, for the story is told by him (linked at the beginning and end by him in the present, in 3D). Secrets of the Masters is a terrific short that is sure to engage you, especially if you've seen the Kung Fu Panda films, but it does just as good a job as entrancing on its own merits.",1336608000,4,1489,4.446886446886447
