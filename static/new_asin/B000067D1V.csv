1714715,5,B000067D1V,I saw this movie when it was first released in theatres .. thought it was funny then and it's still funny now... 30 years later.  30 years?  Yikes!,1361836800,,147,4.214285714285714
1714716,5,B000067D1V,This movie arrived quickly and was in mint condition.  We have enjoyed it several times and have shared it with friends and they too love it.,1267747200,,141,4.423076923076923
1714717,4,B000067D1V,"Most reviews of this movie say it misses the mark, that it isn't all that funny, etc.  I like it. Caan and Gould play excellent buffoons; in fact, few play a complete airhead like James Caan can (Tommy Smothers of course comes to mind).  This movie contains a real historical figure in the form of Adam Worth, an actual 19th century criminal mastermind who is the subject of an upcoming movie starring Christian Bales.  And, Shang Draper's really DID exist.  That historicity in itself makes it very unique. Anyway, the acting is first-rate in this show, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I laughed out loud several times.  The story is easy to follow and allows all involved to exercise their comic abilities.  So, get a copy and enjoy some really good actors in a light comedy that is really unique.",1179360000,7,804,4.619718309859155

7962665,5,B000067D1V,"This is the happiest movie EVER!  We finally got the DVD because our old VHS tape wore out. It is the kind of
movie that is ""safe"" to show five year olds, but is also fun for older groups (even VERY OLD groups).",1507680000,,211,3.9069767441860463
7962666,5,B000067D1V,"Its a mystery why H&WGTNY didn't do better when it was released. Maybe just bad timing. In any case, it has become a classic comedy.

This period romp is boisterous & droll; a curious mix of broad humor & nuanced acting. While its not quite as funny as The Wrong Box or Without A Clue, its way better than the trite, inane fluff that passes for comedy today.

The cast is A-list perfect. Michael Caine, Eliot Gould, James Caan, Dianne Keaton, Charles Durning & some great character actors like Jack Gilford & Burt Young. Normally Im not a big fan of broad comedy, but the acting here is so good it all works. These are real pros at the top of their game. Mark Rydells direction Is deft & meticulous.

The sets, props & costumes are authentic & the musical score is period vaudevillian. The script is complex but also clever. But there aren't a lot of verbal jokes; instead, the humor is in the acting, which is wonderfully visual. Broad at times, subtle at others, its zany without ever veering into full slapstick or going over the top.",1474848000,,1037,4.476190476190476
7962667,5,B000067D1V,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen!  The first time I watched it, I was laughing so hard that I was literally crying.  I couldn't breathe.  The scene where Eliot Gould and James Caan inserted themselves into the play in the theater, next door, while they're trying to break into a vault and are switching off, ad libbing as they go, is hilarious!

It's a movie of a different era, when humor was genuine and not snarky or campy the way comedies are, nowadays.",1445299200,,466,4.447058823529412
7962668,4,B000067D1V,"This was one of my favorite buddy adventure movies while growing up, along with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It really takes me back to watch it again.  It also had a great cast of stars. I didn't give it 5 stars because the video quality wasn't very good at all.",1432166400,,271,4.1923076923076925
7962669,3,B000067D1V,"We have here a notorious picture, one that was such a financial and critical disaster it almost singlehandedly killed COLUMBIA Studios. The film's director afterward complained that extreme editing done by the studio on the heels of universally thumbs down reviews removed all its best jokes.

Directed by Mark Rydelll and set in the year 1892, HARRY AND WALTER GO THE NEW YORK (1976) is a busy little comedy that stars James Caan and Elliott Gould as two mediocre vaudevillians who are even worse at lifting a few bills from the wallets of unsuspecting audience members during a phony mind reading act. Also figuring large in this story is Michael Caine as a renowned millionaire safecracker.

While Harry Dighby (Caan) and Walter Hill (Gould) are caught red-handed with some customer cash, Adam Worth (Caine) is simultaneously apprehended in Manhattan to be extradited to Massachusetts, where he'll stand trial for his most recent bank job.  A;ll three end up in Concord Prison, where Mr. Worth is treated like royalty and Harry & Walter act as his servants, very inept ones at that.

Without revealing the whole story, ultimately the two actor/con men buddies will find themselves in a larcenous race against their former boss. Alas, in the end a remarkable cast, a good premise and superior period costuming can't save a laughless final cut script.

Also with Diane Keaton, Charles Durning, Jack Gilford, Carol Kane, Lesley Ann Warren, Burt Young, Val Avery and Ted Cassidy.

It's no surprise that ""Harry & Walter"" has a middling IMDb rating.

One concession here:
The part where our two hams disrupt the finale song of a corny musical is fun.
Surprisingly, Caan and especially Gould are good song and dance men.

In retrospect, not really for Elliott. He met future wife Babs Streisand while appearing
in the 1962 Broadway musical I CAN GET IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE.",1428710400,,1867,4.961538461538462
7962670,5,B000067D1V,"Love love love this movie. Dean Devlin (from ""Leverage"") mentioned that his dad, worked on this movie. It reminded me that when I saw it at the movies, I laughed all the way through it, and sat through it a second time. So with that reminder from Dean, I ordered the DVD and enjoyed it all over again, this DVD is going to be played over and over and over. Soooo funny.",1412121600,,369,4.138888888888889
7962671,5,B000067D1V,"Quite a hip little caper comedy with Diane Keaton, James Caan, Elliot Gould and Michael Caine.  One of those nifty film surprises that you should have in your dvd collection.",1405209600,,174,4.8

7962673,4,B000067D1V,This is an entertaining light comedy.  It offers an excellent cast and a good story line.  My wife and I have upgraded our movie library from VHS to DVD and this is one that we've watched more than once.,1364947200,,203,4.17948717948718
