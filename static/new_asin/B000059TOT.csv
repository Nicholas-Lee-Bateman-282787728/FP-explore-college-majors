I promised my son who has a dx of DS/autism that we would help him read.
I have purchased many of these videos and am looking for the books to match.
Recommend to anyone who wants their preschooler to have a jump on reading.
Recommend to parents of special needs kids who like videos and who are extreme with their VISUAL learning.",1239148800,,421,4.329113924050633
1409435,4,B000059TOT,"If you aren't familiar with Between the Lions, I suggest you go to the PBS website and check the show out. [pbskids.org/lions]

In general, the show revolves around a library and a family of lions.  The lions and a host of other `eccentric'  characters teach phonics and basic reading by sketches, songs, storytelling and graphic art.

This particular show treats the short `i' sound.  The key word is ""little"".  Aesop's story of the `Lion and the Mouse' is read.

Four Stars.  Excellent educational fair that we wish was only longer.  My 3 and 5 year old children and I love it.",1125273600,,579,4.653465346534653
1409436,4,B000059TOT,"We just bought the entire 35 volume set of Between the Lions videos for our son as a posthumous gift from his grandmother, a librarian and storyteller, extraordinaire.  She would have LOVED this show.

This excellent PBS show feels like an update on Sesame Street with a strong pull for parents to participate and enjoy it along with their kids.  This Lion family in a Library teaches all of us that parents reading to their children every day is how a child will best learn to read.  The show's presentation is a lot like ""Saturday Night Live"" in the old format with some really funny similaries that include using the same music for Wayne's World (made famous by Dana Carvey and Mike Myers) in ""Gawain's Word"", a segment showing the daily creation of a word, and ""Dr. Ruth Wordheimer"" with her couch and office, counseling words and readers alike.

""The Vowels"" series are five of the first shows, based on the series numbers on the outside of the boxes.  These five tapes are very good, but our son much prefers some of the newer ones in the whole volume set because the stories are better and even more creative than the excellent, award-winning first ones!

We watch it every day, and our son, who is 4.5 and was born with probabilities of learning issues due to his inconsiderate birth giver, is already reading words to us on several of these shows and in his books!

Our ONLY complaint about these videos is that they are not available on DVD.  We know that our son will wear them out and we want them to last longer, as they are not cheap!

Our local library's VHS departmenthead told us that they did not have room to add more VHS tapes to their collection, so they would not be buying this series.  That is a CRIME.  These videos are one of the most helpful products I've known on reading, and I know what I'm talking about.  We owned Hooked on Phonics which I bought for my father when he was recovering from a stroke, and it pales in comparison.

We have contacted the management of this delightful PBS show to request that they produce and distribute this product in DVD and encourage you to do the same.

1409437,5,B000059TOT,"My kids just love these tapes and I even enjoy watching them. Very cleverly done, mixing different ways of teaching reading as well as different levels of difficulty. I thought my kids would lose interest after they started reading but they haven't. I like that the words are spelled on the screen so the kids see the letters as well as hearing them.",1038355200,12,350,4.571428571428571
1409438,5,B000059TOT,"I have a daughter, 7, who is struggling to learn to read.  We've tried Hooked on Phonics and other ways to help her learn, but nothing was ""clicking"" - until we discovered Between the Lions.  The videos are well worth the cost and if you have a VCR, I'd buy a few extra blank tapes and record the shows!!",1014076800,13,304,4.135593220338983
1409439,5,B000059TOT,"""Between the Lions Presents the Vowels"" contains some of the very best episodes of the Between the Lions teaching programs.  I just happened to come upon this unique PBS Kids program while taking care of my 2 year old grandson.  We both fell in love with the fast paced, enormously entertaining and highly educational program.  The Lion Family seems to capture the attention of my grandchildren ages 2 to 7.  Even their parents find it to be one of the best educational programs on television today. I find it so delightful that I sit down and watch the antics of all the characters along side my grandson. I only allow 1 hour of television a day and ""The Lions"" as he calls it is what he asks for.  Each video covers one of the vowels and it focuses on that vowel in a variety of fun and entertaining ways.  The music is upbeat and the characters are absolutely hilarious! No wonder this program has received numerous prestigious awards such as the Parents' Choice ""Gold Award"" and The Television Critics Associations' ""Outstanding Achievement in Children's Programming Award.  I have yet to find a more creative program.",991353600,22,1122,4.723076923076923
1409440,5,B000059TOT,"I would highly recommend purchasing the Between The Lions vowel video tapes.  As a mother of 3 young boys and an elementary school teacher, I fell in love with this video.  Not only has it captured the attention of my 3 year old preschooler, but it has also drawn my 1st grader to the TV for some educational fun and phonics review.  I teach early balanced literacy and I recognize the need for authentic, thematic and motivating material to grasp a child's attention and willingness to learn.  Between the Lions does just that.  I initially purchased this video as an Easter present for my 3 year old.  Both of us were immediately drawn to it, so I decided to purchase the two others that were available.  This video's focus is on the short vowel 'i'.  The others focus on short vowels 'a' and 'e'.  All of the videos also feature some long vowel examples too.  I cannot wait until the remaining videos in the series are released on June 12, 2001.
My preschooler use to watch the television show while getting ready for preschool in the morning.  Then the local PBS scheduling changed.  Since I am a working mom, graduate student and sports chauffer for my boys, I found that I was not disciplined enough to consistently tape the shows daily episodes.  It made much more sense for me to purchase and own the tape(s).  I am thrilled with the investment and payback.  I spend daily reading time with all of my children and I naturally focus on in an authentic way, the skills that 3 years old should be learning,i.e. shapes, colors, numbers, counting, letters, etc. within the context of read alouds, bedtime stories and just daily life.  This video is such a great reinforcement.  It shares some aspects of Sesame Street, a show which both my children and I have enjoyed over the years.
My 3 year is often caught uttering songs, phrases, words, and letter sounds from the show, so that I know that it is enjoyed by him.  I feel that by the time he reaches the primary grades, this video will have helped him with a better grasp of language besides all of the other ways that he is acquring language.
Kudos to the crew, the cast and all of their creativity.  I hope that other children, parents and teachers can reap the benefits that our family has shared!",989107200,9,2256,4.53960396039604
