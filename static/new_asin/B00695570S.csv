4980023,3,B00695570S,"Nick Blades (Adam ""Edge"" Copeland) is a New Orleans Detective currently being trial for corruption against Assistant District Attorney Theo Gold (Jamie Kennedy).  On the way to court, he arrest a man named Gil (Kevin Weisman) who was holding on strongly to a newspaper before taking it from him & putting him in the custody of Officer Garcia (Jennifer Esposito) & bumps into his favorite actress Lena Gold (Jessica Walter) in the hallway not knowing that her son is the lawyer trying to put him in jail.  Theo isn't have the best of luck either as his wife Kelly (Elena Lyons) has threatened to leave him & take the kids with her, has his father's (Philip Baker Hall) car stolen from his house, and gets no assistance & harassment from the police due to him having a fellow officer on trial.  Due to a string of incidents happening to both men that connected them together, they become unlikely partners in order for both men to get what they want but they must deal with masked kidnappers, a Police Meter Man who's actually a mob hitman, and figuring out who is behind the criminal plot both men fell into...if they can get along long enough with Theo always trying to play by the book while Nick doesn't mind bending a rule or two to get results.

This is a movie that catered directly to Edge's personality as being a cop who has a sarcastic personality but also smart & actually plays off Jamie Kennedy playing the straight man.  It had it's comedic moments while having a plot easy enough to understand with the only thing negative I have to say is that it's very short (a little over 80 minutes) but I enjoyed it so at least give it look at.",1334016000,4,1647,4.476666666666667
4980024,4,B00695570S,"First the disclaimers: I am not a fan of the WWE nor do I normally watch any of their productions outside of Steve Austin films and a few with that Piper guy. The only reason I got this film was that it was at the local flee market and I needed a fourth film to complete my 4 for $10 and had a choice between this or another copy of ""Hunger Games"" with Russian subtitles. It is with extreme reluctance and prejudice that I popped this film into my DVD, hoping it would not play and I could return it next week for something better.

Adam ""Edge"" Copeland stars as Nick Blades, an unorthodox plains clothes New Orleans detective with a gag name. He is on trial for corruption and is up against Theo Gold (Jamie Kennedy) the assistant DA. Theo is dedicated, uncharismatic, and disliked by nearly everyone including his family. There are a number of odd things going on and about midway through the film the plot is explained to us by an under utilized Pruitt Taylor Vince in a doughnut shop.

There were some LOL moments such as when Blades talks to a young girl sitting on her doorstep. Then there were very slow scenes involving Gold's father. It was a decent second tier comedy/action/cop drama that had the feel of a television pilot. They could have cast better than Jamie Kennedy who did a lame job playing a lame guy. Good sound track.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity",1333843200,2,1367,4.416666666666667
4980025,3,B00695570S,"""In one week Willy Bieber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise."" Detective Nick Blades (Edge) is on trial for corruption and Assistant DA Gold (Kennedy) is the one prosecuting him. After a mistrial occurs and Gold's car is stolen it is up to the two adversaries to work together to solve the crime that gets increasingly more sinister. Yet another movie starring a wrestler. I will have to admit that this is one of the better ones and at least they realize that it is hard to make a serious movie with one. While this boils down to just another buddy movie it is actually not that bad and kind of entertaining. There is enough comedy in this to keep you watching and even though this is fairly predictable it is still very much worth a watch. Fans of wrestler movies will love this, everyone else will enjoy this. At least I did. Overall, much better then the recent wrestler movies. I kinda liked it. I give it a B.",1332633600,,937,4.421965317919075

4980038,5,B00695570S,"I was sooooo entertained. What a fun movie. let me explain....don't expect academy awards here but do expect lots of fun. Jamie kennedy as a stiff-necked District Attorney who is prsecuting Adam Copeland (wrestling's Edge) for being a ""bad"" cop. yes he has taken a few liberties with his duties but he is a good cop, nonetheless. Now there 2 need to work together and solve a case. Jamie is funny and has to finally give in to the charms of Edge who is funny and so charming.  I originally got this movie because I seem to enjoy many of these movies that wrestlers get into, no sure why I do but I'm 80% loving them. This movie Jamie is so good but the movie is stolen by Adam Copeland....Edge. He gives such a sweet and charming performance....I'm a huge fan, not of wrestling but of his.

4980045,4,B00695570S,"My exposure to Adam Copeland (better known as The Edge) comes from the Syfy series Haven, so when I learned of this movie, I had to get it.

I was not disappointed, Adam is utterly charming. Even that was his first acting gig, you can't help but fall for the man. His true personality bleeds through and wins you over. Seriously, the first five minutes had me laughing and praising my purchase.

The movie was hilarious and fun. Jamie Kennedy will always do a fine job and he and Adam were a perfect pair. It's now my guilty pleasure movie.",1359504000,,540,4.39

8495107,2,B00695570S,"WWE Superstars aren't seen as actors, but in fact make some of the best action heroes on the big screen. They may be athletes showing off impossible moves in the ring, but they are also actors, who portray characters and memorize lines on a weekly basis. They are tailor made action stars, who even do their own stunts. That's why I was looking forward to Bending The Rules, It's star Edge is one of the most charismatic superstars in WWE history and he certainly didn't disappoint, unlike the script. The story follows a by the book District Attorney, who turns to an unconventional cop to help him, when his late father's prized possession is stolen. In order to score points with the man who is out to get him, the officer agrees, having no idea the case would take him into something much bigger. As I said Edge was great, the stunts were terrific, he was funny, and had great chemistry with Jamie Kennedy. This comedic duo could have made a great film together, if they didn't get stuck with a script that made little sense and was all over the place. This film randomly jumps between scenes without any context and without completing the scene before it, A lot of it just doesn't make sense. The whole premise is a bit ridiculous to begin with, a D.A. turning to the cop he's trying to bust to help him get back a stolen car, which leads to an international conspiracy, involving the police, the D.A., the FBI, gangsters, drug dealers, gang-bangers, and everyone else they could throw in there. Honestly, I continued to watch this film for it's humor and it's exemplary choreographed action sequences, beyond that, Bending The Rules is a pretty forgettable film.",1495238400,,1668,4.657627118644068

I like that kind of thing, but don't usually find it in B-movies starring pro-wrestlers. That earned it a fourth star from me.",1460592000,,251,4.478260869565218

I am a huge fan of movies and of the WWE as well. So when the two get together it is a win win for me. So I am excited every time one of these WWE films comes out, theatrical or straight to DVD. This was a straight to DVD release which usually means it was a lower budget flick, which of course I don't mind. This one stars WWE's Adam Edge Copeland and Jamie Kennedy.

The film follows Detective Nick Blades and Assistant D.A. Theo Gold as Blades is on trail for being corrupt. The two naturally are on opposite sides until Gold's car is stolen. But being that he goes after cops the police are not there to help out, except Blades. The two become unlikely allies as the search for the car but stumble upon something far more sinister.

I always thought that Edge would be good in a movie or show especially if it was a comedy. He did very well here and was funny but he was just being himself. Kennedy was good at playing the loser as he has played roles like this before. Acting wise the film was good and the story was good for a direct to DVD adventure. Writer Dylan Schaffer did a good job with his second film for the WWE, the first being Inside Out. Of course those are his only two films but still this was good.

This was also Artie Mandelberg's second feature for the WWE but was the director on both. I feel like he did a good job with both but like Dylan I am still not sure which I like better. Any way this was a good flick that was fun and had its moments. Sure this was not the best film made or even the best WWE film but it was good. In all I would say pick it up if you are a Edge fan.",1430006400,,1623,3.9693251533742333
