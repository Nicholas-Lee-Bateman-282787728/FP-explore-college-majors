4444794,5,B004PZWV08,"See the Light Shine is a Christian ministry that has developed a video art curriculum.  There are 9 DVDs in the set.  Pat Knepley is the artist teaching the lessons in the series.  Each DVD has 4 lessons in it with one bonus lesson.  They are short, only about 15 minutes in length.  Each lesson also talks about God and His Word.  The art concepts are all related to biblical concepts and our faith.  It was neat to me to see how the art teacher wove in lessons about God.  Art does reflect the beauty of God and His creation.  Art is also a very special act because it is a way that we reflect our creator.

There is a sample of the first three lessons on their site. My children have done the first four lessons (as have I).  I have wanted to draw for a while now.  I even bought a set of watercolor paints.  But, I struggled to know what to do with them.  I needed someone to show me.  I was reminded of my difficulty as I watched these videos.  There are many wonderful art curriculums that consist of a written text.  Because videos are a different medium, they  have different strengths and weaknesses, which I want to elaborate on.

One of the greatest strength of videos is that you can actually ""see"" someone create a work of art.  You can see how they move their hands and all the little steps involved (if they show them).  If you don't have access to an art teacher, or you yourself aren't experienced in teaching art, there are likely many tricks and techniques you won't be able to demonstrate.  I appreciated ""seeing"" Pat's demonstration of how to hold the pencil so that you can shade.  She was very specific and clear in her directions.  I also liked her explanation of how to draw a lighter or darker line by holding the pencil differently.  I think it was very appropriate and easy to understand for children.  Other strengths of this art curriculum, which is best suited to children in grades 1-6, are that the lessons are easy to follow and simple.  The lessons build on one another.  Also, the art materials needed are inexpensive and easy to obtain.

The one weakness of this curriculum is that the lessons don't give specific assignments to continue the techniques in the lesson.  Pat gives general assignments, but as the assistant art teacher/homeschool parent, you'll want to make specific assignments for your children.  For example, I would suggest that you repeat lesson number 2 with a different object.  I do want to note that after ten times drawing the same object for my contour dressing, my drawing still didn't look right.  Your child may have the same experience.  Lesson 4 could be repeated with another object.  If you're anything like me, write these plans into your lesson planner.  I'd also suggest that you do these lessons with your children.  Usually, when my children watch a video, I use that time to take care of other things that I need to.  In this case, that's not the best idea.  Because these lessons need practice, and additional reinforcement, you need to know what's on them.  You will learn along with your children.  I find that with every year I learn so much right alongside my children.  Many of the gaps in my own education are being filled in.

You may wonder how my children liked the lessons.  Their reaction was a mixed one that requires explanation.  The week before I let them do these art lessons, they watched God's Runaway, another video by See The Light Shine.  They loved the story and the art that they created with one of the lessons on the DVD.  When they watched these lessons, the video wasn't as ""entertaining"".  These art lessons are intended to develop foundational drawing skills in your children.  Most children, and people for that matter, want to create a work of art before they learn how to shade and draw a light or dark line.  So, as you might expect, my children thought lessons 1and 2 were ""okay"".  They were expecting every lesson to be like God's Runaway.  But, by the time we got to lesson 4, they had adjusted their thinking and really enjoyed drawing their shoes.  I think that they would enjoy it more as the lessons progressed and they were drawing more pictures.  The first few lessons just happen to be very basic--and needed!  The great thing about the lessons is that they are short and work well with multiple ages at the same time.  If you're having a hard time fitting art into your schedule--whether because of time or expensive supplies, these videos could be a great fit for your family.

Using an art curriculum, or any curriculum really, needs input and ideas from the parent to make it fit for your family.  I let my children watch the first two lessons on their own.  I shouldn't have done that.  I watched the fourth lesson with them.  We paused the video when we needed to and I explained and reinforced what the art teacher was instructing them to do.  My older daughter wanted to rush and not really ""look"" closely at the contours of her shoe.  I encouraged her to slow down and take time to ""look"" at it as she drew.  You may find that it is helpful to watch it through once and then draw together.  Or you may find that it is most helpful to pause the video several times during the lesson and discuss what the teacher is talking about.  I would definitely say that it was helpful for my children to see me drawing alongside them and explaining to them what curves I saw in my shoe.

When I'm considering curriculum for my children, I have a couple of priorities:  1) Will it teach them what I want them to know?  2  Is it doable or will it feel burdensome?  3  Does it appeal to me--do I want to teach it?  If I don't, I will put it off every day.  4  Do I think my children will enjoy it and will they be able to learn well from this curriculum?  5  Will it fit in our budget?  Number 4 is a conversation for another day, but when it comes to art I want my children to really enjoy it.  It is not an academic subject in my eyes.  I've addressed the other questions in this review already except for #5.  Cost.  The set of DVDs is $100.  On the website, it says that the curriculum could be used over a year.  If you give extra assignments, you could alternate each week between 1 video lesson and 1 extra assignment given by you and stretch out the curriculum to 2 years.  There is another option of a monthly subsccription for $10/month.  Each month 4 lessons (or 1 DVD) becomes available to you.  I think the DVD option is better, though, and much more economical.

This is a long review, but hopefully a very thorough and helpful one.

Please note that I received a complimentary copy of the first DVD in this series for review from See The Light Shine.",1316995200,65,6678,4.432811211871393
4444795,5,B004PZWV08,"We received the first DVD to review in the See the Light Art Curriculum Art Class: Volume One which includes lessons one through four.  Each lesson is about ten minutes long, and this first DVD covers the basics, the basic tools needed, contours and composition, etc. Master artist Pat Knepley is a fantastic teacher, and my 10 yr old really understood the basics after watching this DVD. She is still practicing, but her knowledge of art techniques in general has improved. With her love of art and drawing, I'm sure we will soon have a large collection of DVDs from See the Light!

This curriculum is faith-based and creates an encouraging and inspirational atmosphere.",1300752000,3,671,4.87719298245614
4444796,5,B004PZWV08,"As per the DVD descriptor, ""Each [See the Light Art Class] lesson provides kids with progressive, hands-on tools to learn everything from basic art skills like perspective and shape before tackling tougher challenges and more advanced topics and techniques."" The lesson segments last between 10 to 15 minutes and are taught by the energetic, engaging Pat Knepley.

I found myself itching to create my own artwork after watching the Art Class lessons. Knepley does a wonderful job of tying in Christian themes while teaching artwork. For example, in the first lesson of the series, Knepley explains about the basic tools needed for an artist. She then relates this to the basic tool needed for a Christian - the Bible. These segues were natural and didn't feel forced or ""preachy.""

I thought the length of the lessons were just right. I imagine a child anywhere from first grade to fifth grade being engaged by the material. Knepley also ties in art history into her lessons, which - as an art history junkie - I thought was awesome.

Overall, I'd strongly recommend this product to those looking for a fresh, affordable, enjoyable curriculum to implement into their classroom, be that in the standard school or homeschool setting.

4444797,4,B004PZWV08,"Great series for elementary age children or children that do not have previous art instruction.  The series combines art lessons, art history and Biblical teaching in each lesson.  I have a complete review posted here:  [...]",1299888000,2,225,5.194444444444445
4444798,5,B004PZWV08,"This is a really neat DVD for home schoolers or any family who wants to teach children about Art. It was made for elementary-aged children/classrooms. I received the first Volume-Art Lessons 1-4. The titles of the lessons are: Lesson 1-Tools of the Trade, Lesson 2-It all starts with a line, Lesson 3-Contours & Composition. The lessons are about 10 minutes each with a very nice part where a Bible passage is read and a little explaination. These are short enough to keep the attention of any child. The instructor Pat Knepley is very clear in her teaching and has a very sweet disposition. When my children first started school we home schooled them and we never had anything this wonderful. I believe your home school would really benefit from such wonderful, clear teaching. Also as a bonus on this DVD shows a Chalk Artist and she instructs children on how to do a chalk drawing. That was really amazing to me, because I love Chalk Artist. Also her instructions were very clear and easy to follow.
I highly recommend this set of Art Lessons. It would be a great gift for yourself, your children or grandchildren.

8437831,5,B004PZWV08,"We have homeschooled for several years and fumbled through a few different art curriculums. We haven't really enjoyed or learned from our past curriculums. See The Light Art Class is the first art curriculum that all of my children (and myself) have enjoyed and learned from. I appreciate the simple to follow instructions with (usually) basic materials that can be found around the house. Also, it is wonderful that every lesson is tied back to scripture. My children look forward to our lessons and are excited to practice what they've learned throughout the week.",1514332800,,566,5.031914893617022
8437832,4,B004PZWV08,I really thought this set would be great for a homeschool art class as the kids could just follow the discs. They were able to do that and enjoyed it to a degree but it was not as great as I expected. For the price I paid for this I could have put them in a class at the local community center and I think they would have gotten more out of it. The discs to cover all the basic skills which is a plus and it is good for a rainy day to just do it again.,1495411200,,452,3.622448979591837

8437835,5,B004PZWV08,This is the homeschooling art curriculum we had been looking for. Simple yet comprehensive content combined with the sheer ease of DVD use makes it perfect for our needs. I hope to try others in this series.,1471996800,3,207,4.621621621621622
8437836,5,B004PZWV08,"I had originally planned to use these at least once a week, but kiddos like it so much we end up doing this 2 to 3 times a week.  It's a big thumbs up from us.  My youngest at 6 yrs does not like art, but will sit through this and really enjoy it.  He claims he feels like he is really learning and not just coloring.  It isn't busy work but teaches how and what to do to get what you want. For example in the first few lessons they learned how to hold a pencil to get different results.  They have been learning to shade and how to position objects to draw at whatever angle they want.  We aren't even half way through the DVDS but they have already leaned so much and most importantly enjoy it.  It is just the right length of time so they don't get bored and it ends on a positive note, with a reading from the Bible.  This is a Christian based program and works well with what we teach and do in our homeschool.",1471305600,4,915,3.9617486338797816
8437837,5,B004PZWV08,"I cannot say enough great things about thsi series. My 7 year old daughter loves art and while i  was worried that this class would be too advanced for her, I purchased it anyways because she loves art so much! These lessons are easy to follow. She tells you in the first lesson the supplies you need which are fairly basic: paper, pastel chalk, black marker, a gummy eraser, a white eraser, charcoal, and several different pencils. She does a wonderful job introducing different techniques and always ties in a bible verse at the end. Though I don't share all of her same beliefs (I'm LDS) I found that nothing was so dramatically different that they were faith altering. If anything, they brought up a great faith based discussion about what we believe that might be different and or the same. My 4 year old sometimes joined in on the fun and loved it too, thought it is very hard for him. My 12 year old did some amazing pieces also. I was quite impressed with her ability to teach with ease and that my kids could duplicate it. There are enough lessons in this series to last for a few years of homeschooling if you did practice in between videos. Great series! You won't be disappointed.",1444521600,8,1192,4.493087557603687

8437840,5,B004PZWV08,See The Light art curriculum has been a blessing in our home.  Teaching my children biblical principles through their artwork has brought Art education to a new level.  This program is easy to use and thorough.  My daughter can use it on her own with little instruction from me and is able to create wonderful projects all on her own. See The Light is going to be used around here for a long time.  Thanks Holts' for creating such an amazing program!,1370476800,3,450,4.451219512195122
