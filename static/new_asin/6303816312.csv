704081,5,6303816312,"I really like this video.  The moves can be a little difficult to pick up at first, but there are several sections of a series of moves.  I concentrated on one section at a time, and I still had a lot of fun and was able to learn the moves.  They are shown in a progression, with a few done at half time before doing them at full tempo.
When all the moves are put together they look pretty cool.  The music is upbeat and the video is just plain fun, which makes this is my favorite workout video.",987552000,6,496,3.9797979797979797
7852864,5,6303816312,"I am so happy to have found this video again.(I wish it was a DVD though) I purchased it when it first came out in 1997 and we loved it!  I'm going to give it a try again.  Please note: If you lack coordination and rhythm this video is NOT for you it's Hip Hop, even being from the 90's it's quite a bit to keep up with. This video is a workout for those that can dance and keep up with the beat. If you are up for a challenge they do walk you through the steps before they pick up the pace.",1507680000,,491,3.7115384615384617

it became worn out ,I love this video so much it is truly a workout I feel  it is still relevant, fantastic they should bring hip-hop body shop back ... I would watch it , I wish it were available in dvd",1335571200,,277,4.12962962962963
7852868,4,6303816312,"First of all let's be real, this is not ""Hip Hop"", but it is FUN. At least for me it is. One reviewer said they couldn't keep up and I aggree the first time I watched this I was frustrated because yes, they go fast. However that is the case with every exercise tape I've ever watched. I said the same thing about dancing to the oldies for goodness sake. But  once you get into it and  replay it a few times you ""get it"". It just takes takes practice.

Look, I am a BIG girl and if my big butt can do it anyone can. And once you learn the routines you feel like you've accomplished something. Now I wouldn't go out to a party thinkin' I could get down, but at home I can feel like a hip hop dancer who can hang. Just don't give up if it goes too fast. Thats what rewind is for.",1202601600,2,776,3.8679245283018866
7852869,1,6303816312,"I hated this video.  You have to be advanced for this.  They go over the steps one time, and then....BAM!  NEVER AGAIN!!",1200960000,,120,4.363636363636363
7852870,5,6303816312,"I love the Hip Hop Body Shop Series.  The dancers have great energy and the moves are not too difficult to master.  This is the second tape I have tried and it's fun each time I pop in the tape. I just wish it was on DVD. The twister abs really work if you do it everyday for like 15 minutes.  YOu will see results!  Even though I consider myself coordinated I still have a hard time mastering the routines but that's why it's a tape. Just rewind it, Duh!!",1087084800,2,456,4.033333333333333
7852871,1,6303816312,"I am a teacher of personal fitness and tae-bo.  I gave this video to my students to watch, and it was the worst video I have ever seen! I can do better moves than this while I crap. Why is it all black people and one mexican girl? Where's all of the Native Americans? And i think the mitlitary move is highly ineffective. What soldier would use this in a drill!?! I can't believe I spent two dollars on this.",1075593600,3,408,4.1
7852872,3,6303816312,"The dance class veteran who criticized the video over not counting and left versus right doesn't get it- this video is NOT for dance class veterans. It is for people who like street dance. The music is dated, but better than most of the stuff out there masquerading as workout music. THe moves are NOT for beginners. If you have no coordination, don't buy this video.
I disagree with the reviewer who argues it is not a workout. My husband and I (in our 30s) mastered the video in 4 sessions. We also lost weight doing it. It won't build muscle, but it works the abs very well. If you are in good shape already, it may not be the workout for you. It is not for the ballet and Darrin's Dance Grooves crowd.
I have to admit, I like modern neo-soul, new jack swing, hiphop, and 80s r&b (anything from Run DMC to Luther, through Mary J. Blige). Most workouts assume r&b and modern urban music fans will simply go along with the neo-elevator music out there. I applaud anything that ditches the elevator music. At least this music had a beat to it.",1037577600,22,1043,4.3538461538461535
7852873,4,6303816312,"The instructors attire and music were quite dated - making it a little difficult in the beginning to get enthused. However the quality of the dancers and dance routine is great! This video is for the choreographically inclined with dance moves on the moderate level. One extrememly great benefit is that you can add your own style to every move, and the routine will still look great. For those with lots of dance experience, you will learn the routine first time through. EXCELLENT AEROBIC/CARDIOVASCULAR WORKOUT",1005091200,14,513,5.047058823529412
