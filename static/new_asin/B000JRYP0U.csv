2678456,4,B000JRYP0U,"This is an excellent DVD with amazing images and quality.

Living and working in education in Brazil, found this to be very interesting and spot on with the facts and figures.  It really does tell the story of Brazil though her people.  Most importantly it does capture the real heart and nature of the Brazilian!

Worth watching if you are interested in Brazil and/or Latin America.

One downside - no subtitles in any language.  The dvd itself is all in English, but sometimes with language learners it is handy to have English subtitles at the same time.",1179014400,2,557,4.690721649484536
2678457,5,B000JRYP0U,"As in all the countries so far in this series (Italy, China, Australia, Brazil) this is a dazzling look at the culture of a country in superb photography and intimate portraits of the people and lifestyles of the inhabitants.  Wonderful education and entertaining viewing.",1178496000,3,272,5.181818181818182
2678458,5,B000JRYP0U,Discovery Channel has done a superb job.  HD is the way to go going forward for documentaries as it really brings high definition to a whole other level.  I can't wait for the Planet Earth to come out on Blu-ray disc in a couple of weeks.,1176595200,2,238,4.1521739130434785
2678484,4,B000JRYP0U,"This is a very well produced documentary about the biggest country in Latin America. I live in Brazil, so I can tell it's a little bit focused on poverty - it seems it's like a synonym to Brazil despite you can find that in most cities nowadays. The are lots of natural wonders this video missed, such as Iguacu Falls, the Pantanal area (brazilian Everglades), wonderful beaches in the northeast, the german/italian background in the south, the several agro and high tech industry cities in the countryside of Sao Paulo State etc. However it is worth watching.",1233532800,7,560,4.783505154639175
2678485,4,B000JRYP0U,"I really enjoyed this.  And the High-Definition aspect of it really enhanced the viewing experience here.  The colors were brought to life and you could get so much more of a feelign for Brasil and the people and the culture.

Basically, the narrators and photographers give you views of Brasil through different people's lives and experiences.  There's the aspiring footballer, the aspiring bull-rider and a child attempting to escape the realities of life in a favela through capoeira just to name a few.  Through the stories of the individuals, you get to see more of the country and the vastness of the culture and people and traditions that are rooted from so many other countries and cultures.  From the gritty and seasoned river-boat trader (and... to be a little cynical, I gathered that not all of those vases were empty or available for straight trade...) you can see the awesome Amazon river.  From the pretty young helicopter pilot, you can actually see more than just one's dreams, but another spectrum of life in Brasil, which is that of the slightly upper-class and an opportunity that may not be available to some of the other individuals highlighted.  From the beautiful girl on Easter and the colors of her city, you can see different religious beliefs in the country as well.  And from the sad story of the boy that seemed to have no way out & devastated by his family, you can see a story that's unfortunately a little too common in Brasil - but thankfully with a more promising outcome.

Not to give too much of their stories away, I really liked that they didn't just focus on the poverty in Brasil but rather tried to give an account of life in Brasil from several different perspectives to paint a much more colorful picture that's certainly reflective of the country in general.  There are so many different people with all types of different backgrounds.  I do wish they would have shown a bit more of the interior or the pantanal, but there was only so much time.  Still, I'd recommend this.  The stories are touching and the photography was stunning.  Hopefully they will make another one of Brasil as there are just so many more stories to tell, and places to see there.",1230508800,2,2199,4.704960835509138
2678486,4,B000JRYP0U,"Brazil is a very complex country and full of different angles. It is as big as the US, but very misunderstood... and for some it is even totally unknown.

For the great majority of the world, Brazil is still perceived as the country of Pele (the soccer player), the coffee drinks, a crazy Carnival, bananas everywhere, the pretty ladies, and little else.

Well, this DVD will show you something more than just the ordinary by looking into the ordinary of this land. It will show you another side of the Carnival, another side of soccer, a few characters living with their daily chores, the beauty of nature and the abysmal differences of cultures from north to south.

It is almost complete, for it could not fit in some other geographical areas of the country(like the sunny Northeast and the Europeanish South, for instance). As a matter of fact, it'd need a full collection of many DVDs in order to make someone really understand what this big country seems to be.",1226793600,2,967,4.676470588235294
2678487,4,B000JRYP0U,"This documentary was pretty well done. The best part is the visuals because they look really cool in HD. They followed a diverse group of seven people to give you different perspectives of the Brazilian experience. Each of the segments is very informative with lots of trivia and history.

My only knock is that it seemed overly dramatic at times. They played up the suspense when the audience may not be looking for drama. For each of the characters, the film suggests there's point that they might not make it.

But the overall film is strong and I recommend it.

Also this HD DVD doesn't come in a normal HD DVD case. I comes in a box-like container, similar to some of the first DVD snap cases.",1206316800,3,698,4.480314960629921
2678488,5,B000JRYP0U,"I think this shows pretty much everything about Brazil and brazilains, it was a great show, the discovery channel is always good at what they do. I just didn't like the fact that there was no subtitles available, but still, it's very good information.",1201305600,,251,4.7272727272727275
2678489,5,B000JRYP0U,"I am a professor of geography with a lot of experience in Brazil. I will be using this DVD a lot in my teaching, especially with students I am sending on exchanges. No video can capture an entire country, but this does a terrific job, by documenting the lives of seven people -- of different ages, races, social classes, and sexes -- from very different parts of the country. It makes me nostalgic for some of the places I've been in Brazil and anxious to visit some new ones.

I am looking forward to other videos in this series.",1199232000,2,530,4.353535353535354
2678490,5,B000JRYP0U,"It is a shame that there are people who don't bother to READ what these documentaries are about BEFORE they buy them and are disappointed.

The oft-stated aim of Discovery Atlas is not a history lesson ... it is a unique look at countries through the eyes and personal stories of a select group of individuals.

What better ways to learn the true feelings and emotions than by this manner.

Exquisitely shot, wonderfully narrated, these videos provide a unique look into each of these nations that one would not otherwise EVER be party to.",1198800000,5,539,4.712765957446808
2678491,4,B000JRYP0U,"Great imagery of Brazil, but annoying when people speaking Portuguese are ""dubbed over"" into English, subtitles would be preferred.  The video completely fills a 16:9 widescreen TV (no black bars). The DVD defaults to 2.0 stereo playback. Unusual that you have to enter your DVD player menu to play the 5.1 surround soundtrack.  There are no setup options on the DVD menu.",1185667200,3,372,4.983870967741935
2678492,5,B000JRYP0U,"This will pop your eyes out! This HD-DVD has fantastic color and pin point detail. There's beautiful women on a beautiful beach, awesome cityscapes, jungle expanses,pictures from space, cowboys, carnival, fireworks, martial arts...this disc has it all. If you are looking for 1 disc to keep around the house to show off your HD equipment, this Brazil disc will get straight to what HD-DVD is...you won't go wrong.",1181865600,6,413,5.088235294117647

8152735,5,B000JRYP0U,"I rated this superb  video five stars even though it only focused on the average people of Brazil through the lives of 7 people, most of them young: an old guy running his boat far up the Amazon tributaries to deliver supplies and avoid pirates; a young girl seeking to escape humdrum life as a maid through soccer; a young lady who has become a commercial helicopter pilot in Sao Paulo; a young government worker lady who temporarily escapes business life by dancing the samba in the Carnival parade in Rio in an elaborate costume (but almost unnoticed among the thousands of dancers);  a young girl in a small town preparing a carpet of colored sawdust for the Easter religious parade  with her as an angel; a young cowboy who seeks glory in the rodeo; and the only dismal story of a teen boy coping with the dangerous life in a slum area of Salvador. The visuals include many spectacular airborne views of Brazil. The caveat is that it does not show much of the nature life or natural wonders  the focus is on people. It achieves this goal by tastefully showing much of the spectacle of Carnival, the cities and the country through the lens of lower-class people trying to eke out a living. But it dramatically shows the infectious joy of life that even poor Brazilians have that we should emulate in our affluent country, where many are clinically depressed.",1478304000,,1362,4.615702479338843

8152741,5,B000JRYP0U,"This same blu-ray disc was much cheaper than the HD-DVD version. That's because HD-DVD is lost format. Anyway, the seller did a stellar job in packaging a good product. In addition, this seller did an excellent job of mailing the product much further ahead of time. Thanks. I would recommend this sellar for any product they advertise.",1279152000,,335,4.894736842105263
8152742,4,B000JRYP0U,"Enjoyed immensely. Especially the following of several ordinary peoples lives. Getting to know how they live and what work they do. Customs of their country are enlightening.
If you are a traveller and want to check it out before you make a final decision this is better & faster than reading a book. Great entertainment for any age.",1264032000,,333,4.758620689655173
8152743,4,B000JRYP0U,"I purchased this dvd for my ""Brasil"" collection.  It's an informative dvd, showing Brazil through the lives of 7 Brazilians, and what the Brazilian life is about.  The producer could have improved Sao Paulo part, my hometown, but it only mentions how it is the biggest city of South America.  It does not mention the melting pot of various ethnicities (Asians, Arabians, Europeans, Africa-Brazilians), and the fact that a lot of Brazilians are multiracial.  It also doesn't mention some of the other important regions, such as the central, the Northwest and the Southern part of Brazil( The south region is like the little Europe & the home of the largest & majestic waterfall on earth called ""iguacu"", pronouced i-gua-soo).
In my opinion, one important information a foreign country dvd ""must"" include in the video is its food/cuisine.. too bad this one doesn't.  The Brazilian cuisine is one of a kind!  Over all, I enjoyed this video & its quality overall.  There are beautiful sceneries/picturesques, and the narration is as story telling.  The narrator talks about one person's life in one region of Brazil, and moves on to another, and then goes back to the previous ones and then back & forth.  At the end, she concludes all 7 lives.  Most of all, I enjoy Rio de Janeiro, Ouro Preto, and the Amazon scenes... too bad it doesn't include Foz do Iguacu (Iguacu Falls)

p.s. Everyone in here says that there is no subtitle in it, but usually, in my experience, this kind of informative videos don't have any subtitles.",1234310400,4,1521,4.833976833976834
