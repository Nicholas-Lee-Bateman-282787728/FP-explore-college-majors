2412480,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Indeed, this was a stellar show.  It even had R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor.  However, this show came out 2 years before Starship Troopers, not after.  I actually thought ""Troopers"" was a S:AAB movie from the first trailer.",1127433600,2,230,4.7
2412481,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Like everyone else who has reviewed this set, I am also quite pleased that it finally made it to DVD.  Space Above and Beyond was a show far before its time, which in my opinion is the reason it only ran for one season (that and the show's huge budget, and as we all know, Fox hates spending money on Sci-Fi shows ( like, *cough*, Firefly).  It appears that this DVD set has been recalled with a new version on the way (without the illegal use of the Babylon 5 station which was totally inappropriate).  So perhaps the new one will hopefully have corrected this.  While other people have had problems with the quality of the DVD's that included skips and the like, I have not encountered these problems (most likely because I have a region free player that tends to compensate for issues like that).  But I am quite glad this show was finally released on DVD and can be viewed in its epic entirety.",1126915200,7,898,4.385542168674699
2412482,5,B000BCCAEQ,"It is very disapointing that Fox one of their most expensive productions put in such a price saving packageing. However it is still afabelous TV show with very good special effects. And I think the producers did an excellent job in developing the characters in the first season that well. Even Babylon5 which is another one of my favorite shows wasn't able to develop the characters that well in the first season.

I like the series, even there is a lot of action there also is a very good developed story line. And in comparison to other Sci-Fi shows it shows the humans not at the noble and peaceful beeings. Than the Chiggs are not the brutal and agressive Aliens like in other Sci-Fi shows. Unfortunately it made it just to the first season which in my oppinion was caused by the lack of commercials for it. Because everybody I recomended this show so far liked it even if they were not into Sci-Fi.

Because of this amazing story I give this show the highest rating and I hope it also will soon will get released in the European market and hopefully with a little bit better quality.",1126915200,8,1088,4.48989898989899
2412483,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Well I picked this up from best buy 10 days ago (I went there for millennium s3, and was offered S:AaB for just 20 bucks more !!) and I'm going to have to agree with everyone else: the babylon 5 station in the background is a bit tacky, and almost certainly copyright infringement. The second episode is downright unplayable for a good 5 minutes unless you're watching on a progressive scan dvd player. The first disk even has 4.5 hours of video on it (compared to the industry standard 3), which noticeably reduces image/sound quality on my tv/ss system. And finally, the dvds are double sided and packed 2 to a slimcase. Not only is the constant flipping tedious, but having two dvds in a slimcase increases the chance of scratches.

The show itself is wonderful, and I'd recommend the dvd to any hardcore fans of it.",1126915200,7,819,4.571428571428571

2412486,4,B000BCCAEQ,"I loved this show when it was on Fox 10 years ago.  They always seem to pull the shows I like. I liked the DVD's, I do wish they would have spaced them out for better quality, but at least they released them.  I did notice the huge graphic error on the DVD Menus.  In case you're not a Babylon 5 fan, thpicture of the B5 station ere is a slightly altered on the SAAB Main Menu.  Not only is it not the same universe, but it's a Warner Brothers copyrighted material on a Fox DVD.  So check it out and laugh along with me.",1126396800,,520,3.914285714285714
2412487,5,B000BCCAEQ,"""Space Above and Beyond"" seemed like a good idea the time. Inspired by the TV show ""Combat"" and the novel ""Starship Troopers"", ""Space"" seemed a natural for network TV. Creators Glen Morgan and James Wong (writers and producers on both ""The X-Files"" and ""Millennium"")created 23 episodes(including the original two part pilot)of a compelling drama among the stars. Featuring a largely unknown cast, the series is much closer in spirit to the novel by Robert Heinlein that inspired the movie ""Starship Troopers"" than that film.

Earth suddenly finds itself at war with an alien race called the Chiggs when Earth begins colonizing other planets. When Nathan West (Morgan Weisser)is forced out of his position on one of the colony ships, he joins the Marines in hopes of being near his girlfriend. When his girlfriend is taken as a prisoner by the Chigs, his mission is to find and save her. Others that end up serving with him have their own reasons for joining the Marine Corps Space Aviator Calvary. Shane Vansen's (Kristen Cloke who also made memorable appearences in ""The X-Files"" and ""Millennium"" as well as ""Final Desintation"") family were murdered by rogue ""replicants"" (shades of ""Blade Runner""!)and is inspired to serve by her deceased parents. Cooper (Rodney Rowland) is a Tank i.e., someone born in a lab and wants to escape the prejudice he faces on Earth including an attempt to hang him by bigots.

Well written by Morgan and Wong (they wrote the bulk of the first season) and directed by TV vets (David Nutter-""The X-File"", ""ER"" and Winrich Kolbe-""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" among them), it's a gritty TV show that doesn't pull its punches. The show only lasted a season so never moved beyond finding its legs and developing the storyarcs that were planned.

This five disc set isn't without its flaws. Some folks are having some problems with the discs freezing and skipping (mostly on X-Box players and computers)but it seems the discs play fine on progressive scan DVD players. I'm not reallly happy with the packaging. Fox has housed four of the discs in two slimline holders so there is a chance the dual sided, dual layered discs could become damaged. While the image quality is really, really good but could be better.  I'm at a loss as to why Fox didn't put this out in other holders. I'm sure fans would have been willing to pay 5 or 6 bucks more for better packaging. That's a minor complaint that viewers can fix themselves by purchasing DVD holders.

For those looking to buy this for the extras there's bad news. There aren't any to speak of. Sure, we get the promos but there's no commentary tracks or making of featurettes like was done for ""The Lone Gunmen"" set. I could see why a featurette wasn't done but to not have any commentary tracks from the writers, actors or optical effects supervisors is a bit disappointing. Still, it doesn't diminish the overall quality of the series itself.

Until October ""Space Above and Beyond"" can only be obtained at Best Buy. After that time, you'll be able to get it at amazon.com, other sites and stores.",1126310400,293,3077,4.80718336483932

If the price is right for the DVD set then I would still recommend the series just for the ride. Too bad that the ride ended at a cliff though.",1485907200,,471,4.175824175824176

2412518,4,B000BCCAEQ,"I ordered this box set to relive what I mostly missed back in 1995. At the time, my work prevented me from watching our being able to record this series when it was making its initial run. As such, a series I was actually wanting to watch want an option at the time.

20 years later I can now binge watch this. For the series was made, it certainly does have that 90's cheese that is promised in the description. The special effects, by today's standards, aren't even up to B grade gaming standards, but if you place yourself in the time that this was made, is passable. I find the stories behind the characters more interesting now than I would have when it first aired.

There are a lot of plot issues, in that pilots aren't ever sent on ground combat missions, but I guess in space everyone has to multitask and pull some extra weight.

Other than that one issue, I am enjoying this series.

Delivery and packaging were fine. No complaints.",1482364800,2,943,4.402298850574713
2412519,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Like several other sci-fi shows (The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Firefly, Almost Human), Space: Above and Beyond was a victim of the Fox Cancellation Machine and only got one season.  At first glance, it may look like USMC Kicks Alien Ass: The Series, but it's a lot more than it appears, presenting thoughtful commentary on racism and propaganda, setting up a myth arc that looked really interesting (there's more to the war than first appears:  perhaps the real enemies are other humans, not the alien invaders), and doing its level best to present the full experience of Marines on the front lines of an absolutely hellish war, not just brainless action.

2412545,3,B000BCCAEQ,"This was an ok series for the time period.  The characters play off as whiney brats most of the time.  The acting of the supporting actors are top notch but the main group of ""kids"" not so much.  Conceptually this was a great storyline with some varying degrees of religious and philosophical tones, greatly underplayed.  When this was new I rather enjoyed it, but that was the mid 90's and shows like this appealed to me.  However when watching back to back episodes when I bought this in 2010 on DVD it wasn't quite as enjoyable.

The box set is rather annoying.  I paid $20 in 2010 for this.  These are double-sided DVDs, so you have to flip the disc every couple of episodes.  That is one of those things you find in some of these earlier boxed sets but it is an annoyance.  Also, for anyone who thinks $70 is a good deal on this set, well it really isn't.  I've watched this series on my set all the way through once.  Since then it has been shelved in a climate controlled home and some of my discs have gone bad.  Not a single scratch or blemish, but the media did not last even a decade.  Mine could have been a bad transfer, bad batch or the like, but it is disheartening.

Regardless, if you want this, look elsewhere it still sells for around $20, just not on Amazon.",1460332800,,1278,4.266666666666667

2412547,1,B000BCCAEQ,"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie series as bad as this one.
I barely managed to get through all of disc one until I got so completely disgusted I had to shut the damned thing off.
Why?
Everything. All of it.
Lets start with the plot. If thats what one could actually call it. Whoever did the research and costuming had absolutely zero idea what they were doing. The bad aliens are supposed to be attacking planet earth and opposing them are our heroes, eight or twelve Marine pilots who are supposedly crack ace pilots after only a week or two of training. When these crack ace pilots go into combat, the very first thing they did was to completely disobey orders to go off on their own tangents whenever the urge hits them and there are no consequences whatsoever for their actions. They repeatedly disobey orders to do whatever they want.
I put Marines in quotes in this case because (1) I was a Marine in the 1960s and these eight or 12 hotshot pilots are supposed to be Marine Corps officers. Theyre disgusting, disrespectful and dishonorable to the Marine Corps. The female officers are wearing their hair down past the middle of their back and the male officers all have long hair that juts out from under their uniform barracks covers like broken bales of hay, making them look like some street gang who stole uniforms to dress up and play Marine. They were continuously disrespectful and mouthy towards their superior officers. In the actual Marine Corps behavior like this would have landed them in the brig so fast they wouldnt know what hit them. The ONLY actor in the series that knew what he was doing and was completely believable was Gunnery Sergeant R. Le Ermy and that was because that man was a real man. I can only begin to imagine the disgust he must have felt inwardly seeing the long hair and lousy acting while wearing U.S. Marine Corps uniforms.
Besides looking and acting like hippies in Marine uniforms, the acting was stilted, immature and melodramatic. The plot was weak, scattered and strung out as though they were making it up as they went along. I feel like this series was written and directed by a disorganized group of high school kids with B and C averages in their schoolwork who didn't bother whatsoever to do any research as long as the chicks were really hot and the guys were real hunks. The characters, acting, uniforms and special effects were childish and immature.
All I can say is, I am certain this was a very, very low budget movie and if you are science fiction aficionados as I am, I plead with you to not bother wasting your money on this movie.",1459036800,,2613,4.526427061310782
2412565,5,B000BCCAEQ,Classic 90's SciFi at its best and worst.  All the cheese plus all the grit they could muster during prime time.  Worth a binge watch for sure.,1456704000,,143,4.2592592592592595

This was excellent.  Didn't realize how dark it was at the time, but now, after having watched the improved BG and more recent Doctor Who, I can see it.  Shame that this only lasted a short time and wasn't continued.  With all the other crap that gets rehashed 3-4+ times this definitely deserves a look.  Plots, subplots, backstories... all have been great.  Only picked this back up on a deal a week ago, and already half way through and not at all disappointed.  A lot of the major themes are still relevant and while the time line is in the near future, it still has plausibility (other than an occasional older reference, like CDs).

I ordered it used, in very good condition (casing was a little worked over, but the DVDs were in good double sided condition).

Originally planned for five seasons, it ran only for the single 1995-1996 season. i remember watching this when i was around 14-15 and just loving it! every (I think) Tuesday night at 7pm I was in front of the tv! and i was soo mad that the 2nd season never happened.
the story is centered on a squad of marines in the future fighting a unknown alien thats destroyed our colonies. but its not just a sci-fi war pic, its got aton of history and side stories that go with the fight scenes and the characters. you end up feeling your part of the squad as they fight for the future of the human race. the graphics and special effects aint that great but then this was 95 and 96 so really pretty good for then. but the storyline was soo well thought out. the show was created by Glen Morgan and James Wong who also worked on the x-files.

Years later it reminded me of the Battle Star Galactica remake, but I'd say SAAB had more potential since it was new and great from the very first episode.  Many series take some time to get their groove going, but SAAB really hit the ground running and was great from the start.  I remember that every review I read from critics (which was quite a few) were all positive.  Everyone who watched it seemed to like it.  It was a great show.  Unfortunately, for some incredibly stupid reason, the show's producer didn't personally like it so they did literally everything possible to kill it.  Seriously.  They changed its time slot several times, they put it up against the Simpsons (which was THE powerhouse and a death sentence at the time) and they would even skip a week or two between new episodes.  In decades of watching TV I've never seen any other series get such incredibly bad placement and scheduling turmoil.

2412696,4,B000BCCAEQ,"My only complaint was that it wasn't able to be completed!

Here goes the adventures of the Wild Cards Space Marines. Following a format that the more famous 2004 BSG would perfect, it shows a dark future, in which human discrimination hasn't been done away with. The UN has complete control of the planet. And aliens are gunning for us!

Pros: I really love how this show depicts a war with aliens as not being something that we would win so easily. It's tough work, and they keep making throwback references to WWII to give examples of just how grim the war is going. The characters might be wooden at times, but the characters are believable enough. It's also an interesting idea to portray the aliens as attacking us because our leaders wouldn't listen to them. Part of the appeal I have for the show is the X-Files feeling of government conspiracy. That whole, deny everything and confirm nothing feel. The series also ends on a very good cliff-hanger and makes one wish they had done at least another season.

Cons: True, part of where it fails is the main character is so....anti-hero almost, that every single time he is given a medal, he rejects it. He enters the marines to go find his girl, so WHY wouldn't he want lots of medals to flash at her, even if he didn't agree with the government? Also I felt the whole idea behind their AI and artificial life was simply to give actors with no talents something to do.

2412716,3,B000BCCAEQ,"let me say this the series itself is great from the first disc to the last but i felt fox cold have done more with this.

First off let me get some pet peeves out of the way.

I HATE DOUBLE SIDED DVD'S OR BLU RAY

look i get it it is a way to save money but I HATE THEM why they don't have a safe side and it is way to easy to get them dirty. i understand you got to cut costs to bring this out on the dvd set but doing the whole double sided dvd is a lazy way of making a quick buck when you could do a single side with a safe side to make getting them dirty a lot less easy and making it easier for someone who aint very dvd friendly.

PUT SOME EXTRAS ON DVDS

secondly if you are going to bring out a dvd set put some extras on it. This is a straight to dvd show wile the show is great some extras, trailers, out takes, visions of what would have happened in the future had the series continues, reflections something and this dvd set would have been better. this really makes me mad when tv companies bring a great series out without any extras for the fans.

With the pet peeves out of the way lets get to the good
this is a great series, if you love scifi, halo, action, story telling that aint rushed then this is the series for you. You could see where CGI on tv was going by looking at this series, the space dogfight scenes are like a mixture of star wars and the old war movie midway. The characters are not perfect from the daughter trying to run from the memory of her parents deaths to the guy trying to find his wife missing among the stars, to the human born in a test tube but forced to join because of a bad turn of events these are characters that you can relate to. this was before American Idol, Survivor, the voice, or big brother ruled the tv. This was the time of storytellers and this series is a great story of fighting not for a country or an idea but for the man, or woman beside you. If you can get beyond the bad choices the network made in using the double sided dvds and lack of extras this is a series

PS. I put in disk one in my blu ray player on both sides and it worked great i have heard there have been disc read errors but that did not happen to me.",1397174400,,2189,3.883668903803132

2412744,2,B000BCCAEQ,"I originally bought this because it came out during a period I was at sea and couldn't watch it live. However after allowing it sit on my shelf for about two years to marinate, I decided to take it out and go on a spree. I cant get that time back now, and regret it deeply.

While the notion of a world at war with an outside power is an attractive one generally, what kills this series is the long periods of time the ""Wildcards"" spend navel gazing. If I timed it, I imagine a couple of hours could be clocked of the main characters  obsessing about their inner turmoil, personal and professional issues, and relationships. Anyone who navel gazes this much is either vertically challenged or choses to keep their eyes near waist level. After awhile you want to tell them to suck it up and get on with it.

Some of the redeeming characteristics of the show are the inclusion of Tucker Smallwood as the Commodore, and the accurate portrayal of navy colors and protocol on board ship, and Sgt Lee Ermy. Being a former Navy man there is nothing more annoying than bad portrayals of the small details of military life. As for Tucker Smallwood, he is always an excellent actor that projects a commanding presence no matter what part he is in. As for Lee Ermy, he's is outstanding no matter what he is in. But his inclusion during the first episode could not carry this show and seemed to be a gimmick used by the show runners to up their ratings going into the season.

As a Sci-Fi lover, I can suspend disbelief, and allow for a lot in a well constructed universe. However I feel this was a bit ahead of its time, and could have been better written. Overall, it was a solid premise, badly written and poorly executed.",1384128000,,1713,4.4113924050632916

1. the writing was very well done, the stories were put together well and made you want to keep with the show.
2. the actors did a excellent job portraying the charecters well.
3. the set design was extreemly atentive to detail, all of their suroundings had scrapes and dents to look realistic, it just had a well lived in / worked around look to them.

as for the dvds, the transfer was done rather sloppely, its kind of grainy to a degree. also if your into science there are some science referances that were made that even most high school kids would know were wrong.

I think this show would have gone longer, if it was not pre-empted by Football. many shows were put off when Football went into overtime, or not shown at all in favor of X-files.

2412805,5,B000BCCAEQ,"WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS

The show was the creation of James Wong and Glen Morgan, trading off the heat they were producing from their sterling work on The X-Files.

Set in 2063, the show follows the adventures of the Wildcards: a rough, tough land, sea, air and space combat squad serving in the war between mankind and a mysterious alien race dubbed the Chigs. Stationed on their huge spaceship USS Saratoga, the troops embark on thrilling missions, either as ground-based infantry or in their Hammerhead fighter planes, which can operate in Space and in the atmosphere of planets.

It turns out humans have just come out of a long and bloody war with their own Humanoid robots-gone-bad, the Silicates, who have collaborated with the new alien enemy. What's more, there are these artificially gestated humans around: the In-Vitros (Tanks or Nipple Necks, to use the Vernacular, almost like a racial epithet in the show) who are rapidly developed than ""born"" at the age of 18. One of the main Wildcards, Cooper Hawkes, is one such being. Everything about the In-Vitros is brilliantly handled: they are often nave in their outlook, yet angry at being treated like third-class citizens. Hawkes finds himself uneasily becoming part of a tight team after years of shunning human contact.

Occasionally, traditional battle tales are cleverly updated for the advanced outer space setting: in one episode, the Wildcards send a captured enemy fighter on a surprise Trojan horse mission, as they believe the Chigs have no equivalent tale in their lore; similarly, a Chig pilot comes to pose a Red Baron-style threat to the humans. Vernacular

Wong and Morgan's clout meant the show was handsomely back dropped, rumoured to have cost around $1m an episode. The special effects may now look like something from a low-rent video game, but they get the job done. Clearly influenced by Starship Troopers (the novel). Five seasons were planned, yet only one was made - an enticing glimpse of what could have grown into something truly great, shame on the `BLANK' network for cancelling this great show. I received a non-American disc set, so my review lacks further DVD details.",1345507200,,2165,5.0194986072423395

2412808,4,B000BCCAEQ,"After watching the Battlestar Gallactica series in it's entirety, I tend to judge all scifi series against that series. To me, BSG is the paradigm of modern scifi series.

Space is also damn good. It does not quite reach the standards that BSG had, but it is (overall) an excellent series; unfortunately cut short before it could properly finish, as BSG did.

I think that the character development in Space was excellent. Most of the characters were likeable and endearing, not overly complex. The stories were mostly very good. A couple of episodes were not so good, but that is acceptable. What series does / did not have at least one or two episodes that were not at the ""best"" level?

You always hear ""gritty"" used to describe this series. Sure, why not? It is ""gritty"", much the same way that BSG was, but I did not find that to be the defining characteristic of the series. I thiought that the characters really made the series special, with the writing a strong second. This was a very entertaining series, and worth the coin at 30 bucks or less.

I find myself falling into the cliche of wanting to see a celebrity actor in this series.  Its a bunch of no-name actors, and this show did not last long enough to make any of these guys famous.  James Morrison, the colonel on the battleship, looks familiar, but just familiar.  a lot of scenes are stuff reworked from battlestar galatica, and terminator.  the show struggles to find its own unique flavor.  the episodes are cliche story lines of soldiers with attitudes going into battle-hardened frontlines.  its a war that never ends.  and we don't really get to understand what the enemy is all about.",1323388800,2,912,4.69620253164557

You have humans, ""Chiggs""(Short for Chiggers little flea like bugs that live in wood that will borrow in your skin) Chiggs are the unknown ""Aliens"" who  unproved attack Human Colonies on other planets and whom also are bent on Conqering earth, You also have A.I.'s Human built androids who decided to ""Take a chance"" on starting a war (Previous to the series) with humans and then stealing space ships and running into space and As you will find out in the series become ""Pirates"" and another enemy to humans. Humans have also people called ""Tanks"" and you will see how humans react to them and how they are treated.

It is interesting look back on the production quality and special effects of just 6 years ago and see a huge difference between say the Ronald D. Moore BattleStar Galactica effects and this series.  If you can ignore the production issues and realize that this is what the Hard Eight crew had to work with, it is still a well done gritty adventure with at decent backstory.

Hinweis: Rezension bezieht sich eigtl. auf die TV - Serie (! ! !)

Nur, da diese ja ganz offensichtlich (dh. noch ?) nicht auf VHS bzw. DVD mit deutscher Tonspur erschienen ist, und somit nur wschl. mehr den Fans aus den diversen Free - TV Wiederholungen ein Begriff ist, mach ich's eben gleich ber diesen ""Umweg"". Auch, fr Leute, die sich (wie ich selbst), entweder zuerst das Buch besorgen und dann hinterher den Film, - die Serie ansehen, um zu vergleichen oder umgekehrt. Sowie ebenfalls, weil es hier endlich mal Zeit wird fr eine natrlich (alte Synchro) deutschsprachige DVD - Auflage !

""Space 2063"" - alias - ""Space - Above and Beyond"" ist eine relativ kurze SF - Serie (auf gewisse Weise in sich ""abgeschlossen"" in nur einer einzigen Staffel, oder es wurden trotz dem etwas offenen Ende wschl. auf Grund von geringen Einschaltquoten keine weiteren, bereits geplant gewesenen ""Nachfolger"" - Teile mehr gedreht !?), aus den Jahren 1995 - 1996.

Spter, auf deutsch (synchronisiert), lief sie zuerst im Free - TV auf VOX, - wurde spter nochmal von Pro 7 wiederholt. Etwas kritischer betrachtet zwar im groen und ganzen schon ein einziger Abgesang bzw. eine z. T. manchmal nervige Lobeshymne auf das United States Marine Corps, so das sich der Verdacht einer Finanzierung/ Beteiligung stndigt aufdrngt. Und sich hier auch nicht vllig abstreiten lsst.

Aber doch (auch wegen der vergleichsweise noch relativ primitiven Technik bzw. weil inzwischen die Handlung bereits schon in ""unserem"" Jahrhundert spielt) eine ganz grundsolide und bestens unterhaltende Science Fiction Serie, die sich nicht hinter ""Star Trek"" mit all seinen ""Ablegern"" oder auch ""Spacecenter Babylon 5"" zu verstecken braucht.

Viele der gezeigten Parallelen ...

(In - Vitro's bzw. ""Tanks"" = also, Menschen, die eben durch Geburtenrckgnge und Verlust von Soldaten knstlich in Kammern gezchtet, um gleich mit 18 Jahren voll ausgewachsen ""geboren"" zu werden.

Silikanten = fast nicht von echten Menschen zu unterscheidende Androiden, die nicht mehr an die inzwischen in vielen Filmen und Serien gezeigten und gerne zitierten ""3 Gesetze"" von Isaac Asimov gebunden sind usw. usf.)

 ... sind mittlerweile auch schon heutzutage bereits in Anstzen zu erkennen und somit nicht mehr nur direkt als ferne ""Zukunftsmusik"" zu bezeichnen.

Aber nun erstmal etwas zum Inhalt dieses Taschenbuch's: Wir schreiben das Jahr 2063 ... die Menschheit lebt in Frieden und glaubt, allein im Universum zu sein. Sie macht sich auf, fremde Planeten zu erforschen und zu besiedeln. Doch unter der Oberflche dieser ""schnen neuen Welt"" ist dieselbe Korruption zu finden, wie (damals) im 20. Jahrhundert auch.

Pltzlich werden 2 ihrer Kolonien von einer unbekannten ausserirdischen Macht angegriffen und vernichtet, ob es berlebende/Gefangene gegeben hat, ist nicht genau bekannt. AeroTech, ein Unternehmen mit weltweiten Monopol und Verbindungen in die allerhchsten Kreise des Militrs und der Politik (""Akte - X"" lsst hier ganz gewaltig ""gren"" !), das die Besiedlung leitet, ignoriert(e) die Warnungen der ""Einheimischen"", nicht auf ihren Planeten zu siedeln.

, - kein Wunder, die Produzenten Glen Morgan und James Wong waren viele Jahre an ""Axte - X"" beteiligt, Darstellerin Kristen Cloke kam auch schon in einer Episode vor , -

Es kommt zwangslufig zum (interstellaren) Krieg, dessen Ausgang noch ungewiss ist und der das Ende der gesamten Menschheit bedeuten knnte. Aus fnf jungen Leuten, die aus verschiedenen Grnden zum US Marine Corps gegangen sind, wird eine Kamptruppe gebildet, die unter einem altgedienten Colonel gegen die Auerirdischen, die so genannten ""Chigs"", in die Schlacht ziehen.

Aber nicht nur die Chigs alleine sind die Feinde der Menschheit, sondern auch die ""Silikanten"". Diese waren einstmals Geschpfe der Menschen gewesen. Aber einer ihrer Entwickler hatte einen Virus entwickelt, der sie umprogrammiert hat, so das sie sich schlielich gegen ihre Erbauer auflehnten (auch ein nur allzu bekanntes Thema in der SF - Literatur).

Es begann ein auf der Erde viele Jahre andauernder Krieg mit den ""knstlichen Intelligenzen"". Wegen dieses Kriegs wurden auch die ""Tanks"" gezchtet. ""Tanks"" sind genmanipulierte Menschen und werden ""In - Vitro"" (knstliche Befruchtung im Reagenzglas) gezchtet und bis zu ihrem 18. Lebensjahr in Behltern aufbewahrt, um dann bei Bedarf und somit gleich quasi auf ""Abruf"" geboren zu werden.

 - , per Wachstumsbeschleunigung natrlich, dh. 18 ""normale"" Lebensjahre werden hier dann wohl auch nur noch lediglich ein paar Tage bzw. Stunden betragen !? , -

Die Tanks siegten dann im Krieg ber die Silikanten. Aber einige verbliebene Silikanten schafften es, in gestohlenen Raumschiffen von der Erde ins All zu fliehen. Dieser Krieg war also gerade noch gewonnen, und es begann danach ein jahrzehntelanger, trgerischer Frieden. Die Menschheit konnte sich erholen und machte eben genau das, was sie immer in solchen Fllen macht ... sich vermehren und noch weiter auszubreiten bzw. nun auch im All zu expandieren, - bis zu jenen Tag im Jahre 2063, - als der erste Kontakt mit einer fremden Rasse sogleich in einen neuen Krieg mndete.

,- ""Stoff"" genug wre also vorhanden gewesen fr eine ziemlich langatmige Serie in den gleichen Dimensionen wie etliche andere. Nur leider kam es aus den oben bereits genannten Grnden wschl. eben halt nicht (mehr) dazu. ,-

Darum werden Fans und Kenner also auch niemals erfahren, was mit Shane Vansen und Damphousse wirklich nach ihrem Shuttleabsturz passierte. Und ob Wang in dem Container (der aber nicht explodiert, sondern nur lediglich auseinanderbrach) evtl. doch vieleicht berlebt haben knnte. Oder, wie der Krieg gegen die Chigs denn nun weiter, - bzw. ausgegangen ist !?

Nachtrag: sehr alte Rezension, - inzwischen scheint ja so etwas wie eine (exakt genau 5 DVD's) englischsprachige Box erschienen zu sein. Laufzeit leider nur 60 Minuten, - ungenaue Angaben, wschl. sind damit aber doch die Minuten pro Folge gemeint, also komplette Staffel !?

2412836,4,B000BCCAEQ,"This series is as good as I remember it. The effects were state-of-the-art for the 1990's. Some of the effects were weak, the plastic on the fighters at times did wiggle and the clank of closing the canopy did not always match up with the picture.

It's too bad the series never had an ending. I guess I will never know if the world did end as we knew it.

My only problem was with the discs. They are double sided and impossible to read the labels without a magnifying glass.

All of my discs played without a glitch.",1311033600,,518,4.212121212121212
2412837,5,B000BCCAEQ,"This is a very well done SF series.  Well developed characters, good plot lines (though a bit worn in hindsight), and outstanding sense of place and story.  It is a shame that the series didn't continue.  I found I was longing for more of the saga.

Great series.",1307404800,,263,4.416666666666667
2412838,3,B000BCCAEQ,"I missed this when it was on air in the 90's, and found it cheap at Best Buy recently and picked it up.  The story gets rolling right off the bat as a civilian science astronaut gets cut from his mission and then joins the US Marine Corp to get into space and look for his girlfriend who was not cut from civilian mission.  I thought that was a good way to set up the whole series: 2 lovers separated in space.  The rest you'll have to watch, but I'll tell you there is a major space war going on.

The best thing about this show is the characters.  The sets all look good, fairly believable, with interiors looking more like naval ships than Star Trek's Enterprise.  The special effects are decent.  The only problem I had is that a couple episodes seemed slow paced and more like filler.  But overall very enjoyable, especially if you don't want your space squeeky clean like Star Trek, and if you think Marine corp uniforms look better than Star Trek ballerina costumes

EDIT TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: I took off one star as I am re-watching some episodes and I notice that about 2/3 through the series it seems to really change gears.  The writing and stories get very predictable, the main character seems to becoming a little whiney brat, no one follows direct orders in combat, combat/action scenes are boring and go no where. Somewhere this series got off track and wanders aimlessly for much of the last episodes.",1304208000,,1416,4.49609375
2412839,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Just a shame that TV cannot sustain a tremendously thoughtful, directed and inspiring series. I often wonder what it says about our society. Innovative shows that aren't about sex or sophomoric humor have little chance of making another season.

That being said, this is a superb and engaging series where one becomes truly involved with the characters and is worth watching over and over.",1299110400,,389,5.078125
2412840,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Great series that never quite had a chance for an audience share. If you take the old series Combat and Star Trek, you would end up with something similar.

2412841,5,B000BCCAEQ,I always wondered what happened to this series. It is one of the best made for TV sci-fi series ever. The social issues they dealt with were reminiscient of Star Trek of the sixties. I would like to see a redux of this series using the great CGI techniques we have today. Several episodes reminded me of scenes from movies like Apocolypse Now. This would be a great feature film.,1297036800,,379,4.428571428571429
2412842,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Space: Above and Beyond was a late 1990's series that focused on young Marines who were typically deployed on a variety of missions: Infantry, Piloting, Recon, Protection, Patrol. They are the Space Aviator Cavalry, 58th Squadron, stationed on the USS Saratoga.

The main series protagonist were a race of aliens known as the Chigs; these spacesuit/armor wearing beings always keep the united States Marine Corps hopping, but this is just one story arc of many introduced during the series' first and only season.

Spotlighting some of the Story Arcs:

Aero-Tech and the UN (covert cover ups)
The Silicates (Artificially intelligent Humanoids/Androids)
In Vitroes (also known as Nipple Necks, these are artificial Human clones - 1st Lt. Cooper Hawkes and Lt. Col McQueen are IV's)

I only caught Space sporadically when the series first aired; I grabbed the DVD set because the reviews and the product interested me. The special effects are par for the course for the late 1990's, but what really drew me into the series were the young Marines of the 58th Squadron and their adventures.

I enjoy the piloting aspects of the series, and like the versatility as the 58th is deployed on a variety of missions both space bound and planetary bound. The actors and their performances also make the show a good family show to watch as well.

Favorite episodes include (though the entire series was a joy to watch):

""Dark Side of the Sun"" - encountering Silicates who have taken over a mining facility
""Ray Butts"" - focuses on a classified mission (and a tough as nails Marine) objective that causes some issues
""Stay With the Dead"" - one lone survivor from the 58th makes it back to the Saratoga...but are the others still alive?
""Toy Soldier"" - a younger brother of one of the 58th joins the Marines
""Sugar Dirt"" - survival on a blockaded planet
""Who Monitors the Birds?"" - One shot focusing on Cooper Hawkes
""The River of Stars"" - just a good sci-fi Christmas themed episode

I'd recommend Space Above and Beyond for anyone that would like to check out a non-Star Trek (and I love Star Trek) science fiction series that offers much more in the way of focusing on a Marine element with some good potential story arcs showing the potential of a wider universe.",1290816000,,2254,4.8062015503875966
2412843,4,B000BCCAEQ,As a fan of SciFi I remembered this TV series from some time ago and wondered if it was available on DVD and sure enough it was - I missed most of the episodes of what was an engaging story of human survival against alien aggression.

I loved the journey and I can say, without a doubt, that this show is the father of modern sci-fi on television. This brutal, in-you-face style is now seen in Battlestar Galatica, Caprica, and Stargate: Universe. This is a great time for science fiction and im enjoying every minute of it!

I saw an interview of the two producers, the asian guy and the other one, they said that the mockup of the hammerhead plane was sitting at the docks from transport and that Chinese spies were seen photographing the mockup and ran away, guess they weren't sure it was all fiberglass.
Thank goodness they didn't try to do one of the more modern endings that end with disaster, like the last Lost episode, the last Farscape, and the last Battlestar Galactica epsiode/s, I mean, what tragedies of waste of time, insult to intelligence, etc, so at least SAAB wasn't soiled with a worthless ""ending"", I mean, can you imagine what would have been done now(?), I know I can, probably a episode of how the earth needs to surrender and intermarry with the chigs, or like a lost episode where everyone is already dead, or a farscape ending where continued fighting with the chigs will destroy the universe, or like in Battlestar Galactica(newer) that earth is destroyed but the survivors find a planet and go native, without technology.

I wound up caring about the characters and, although a couple of the episodes were a little slow, cared too about the arc of the story. As the story ends peace is NOT breaking out -- the heroes have become players in an enemy plot to kill high-ranking Earth military figures,but have rescued a number of Earthers who had been held captive for some time. Some of our heroes have died, but a couple remain. There's enough left so that someone could blow on the embers and relight this one!

2412864,5,B000BCCAEQ,"I was glancing through the reviews of this show left by many people and discovered here are a few people that did not like this show, or complained about its value without any real answers.  When this series first aired on Fox, DVD players had not been invented,  Computers were just starting to get a windows upgrade, and Primestar was supposedly the next big thing in the satellite television competition against the high price of cable.  Now that we have that stated lets go on to the series itself.

When this show first aired on FOX, I recorded every episode on VHS.  I did not notice any episodes missing from the series, but if there were one or two, they were probably the few episodes that a) I did not like much or b) Episodes that did not move the storyline along.  Another gripe I noticed from other reviews is ""Why Did Fox cancel this series?""  Being an avid TV Guide reader in the early / mid 90's, TV Guide stated that the time slot and expense of producing each episode was far outweighing the amount of viewers.  At the time each episode was costing Fox in excess of $1,000,000.  This may not seem like alot of money today but it was in the early 90's.

One of the greatest things about this series was that it was the return to Great Space shows on television.  This show was not ""Star Trek"", it was not ""Battlestar Gallactica"", nor was it a return to ""Buck Rodgers in the 25th Century"".  It was an original.  The space ships blown up in space did not have the firey graphics that most of the space movies have, and the battles appeared a little more realistic.  Afterall to produce fire you need oxygen, and there is not any oxygen in space, so why would a spaceship actually burst into flames?

I also noticed that some people have compared this Television series to ""Starship Troopers.""  However, the only thing similar to this series is that it the military in space.  They are not fighting gigantic bugs (although the chigs may remind some of a cockroach), and instead of major land battles most of the fighting happens in spaceships.

Now that i have these gripes out of the way, lets go to what the show does offer.

For starters, Earth is at peace.  The entire planet has 1 army.  We are no longer fighting one another, instead we are expanding our space program.  The few previous wars that lead us up to this great space war was one created from A.I.'s (robots we created for fighting that eventually became self aware and started attacking us <Star Trek fans, Think of Borgs>).  To battle these cyborgs we created Tanks (Humans born in test tube facilities to become soldiers.)  However, after the war ended Tanks were no longer needed, so what did the world do with these ""Tanks.""  Here is were we witness a world where prejudice issues do not fall upon a race of people, but instead those born in test tubes for military purposes.  I will not discuss the Tank situation further because I think everyone understand s the idea of Prejudice.  Carry On.  We still think we are alone in the Universe, UNTIL....

We are attacked by people from a distant planet.  None of our weapons have any effect on these aliens. Furthermore they are faster,  more advanced, and have a better understanding of combat.  Even those Earthlings trained for the most extreme fighting (Think Green Beret or Navy Seals) have no advantage against these invaders.  Along comes a group of misfit soldiers (the Wildcards), who in fact win Earth's first victory against these aliens.  This is how the series begins in the two hour pilot and continues from there on.

The only gripe I have about this series is the fact that it only lasted one season.  It was done well enough to produce a ton of movies (Similar to Star Trek or Star Wars).  But no one wanted to go any further.  My main advice to anyone who is thinking about buying this DVD set but is unsure of it, is to buy it only if you are a fan of Star Wars or Star Trek.  Although it was created by former X-Files writers, it has nothing to do with that series.  Also it was created way before many of the television shows that some people are attempting to compare it to, so I wonder if someone did not steal this idea and attempt to ramp it up in theri show.

Overall it is a great deal.  Maybe that was the main reason I purchased this DVD, the day it was released at Best Buy.",1260230400,3,4337,4.431099873577749
2412865,1,B000BCCAEQ,"I am a huge fan of sci-fi, love Firefly and was hoping to find something interesting like it. I was hugely dissapointed. I tried to overlook the wooden acting because some of the characters had potential, but the writing got worse and worse each episode.  The dialog was unbelievably banal and predictable.  And so were the storylines.  After getting painfully through the ""River of Stars"" episode (on disk 3), I finally gave up.  That one was the last straw for me. I really cannot recommend this series to anyone except perhaps to the fans of the movie Starship Troopers 3. I know they are out there....somewhere.",1259107200,14,615,4.773584905660377
2412866,1,B000BCCAEQ,"Unimaginative, flat, and cliche-ridden. The writing is at the high school level; the actors are not good enough to overcome it. It's neither good enough to make you care nor bad enough to make you laugh; it's down in the unenjoyable valley with Robot Jox.

One would expect people writing a military sci-fi show to, for example, understand the use of the word ""niner"", or know that a light year is not a unit of time.

This show was simply awesome, and had a great aesthetic that we are seeing in modern Sci-Fi shows now like Battlestar Galactica and the new Star Trek. I highly recommend it.

Here is where I got in trouble- I was watching, and getting really confused because things seemed to be jumping ahead really fast. You need to flip the disk over! There are episodes on both sides. I had to back track to the beginning to watch the episodes I missed.

While this show could have really used a Battlestar sized budget for graphics, the actors are good, and the story line is clever. Two thumbs up!",1243209600,3,846,4.152439024390244

Good acting, generally good scripts and CGI light years ahead of the (then) competition, this is good sci-fi.",1242604800,,359,4.538461538461538
2412898,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Even though it has been a real long time since this show came out (and then ended too soon), it still holds up, and is as good, if not better than much of the newer Sci-Fi on TV today.

It's not a big budget TV franchise or mini series. The show and stories focused on a squadron of solders and their immediate surroundings, much like the old WW2 TV series Combat and/or The Gallant men.  Also the effects then (mid 90s) were not what they are today. But the show was entertaining and did not get bogged down in the ""same ole"" filler, soap-opera story lines almost every week, like some Sci-Fi TV shows seem to do.

Also If you watch this complete series and then see some of the newer shows, you will see bits, pieces and whole plots and ideas taken from this series. I think the look and feel of the new Battle Star Galactica series is a good example of what I mean.

Space Above and Beyond was a good show that should have had a longer run. But at least you can see it now DVD....

If you like SCI/FI this will probably make you love it and run down to join the USMC. Okay, I'm exaggerating  a little...It truly was a work of SCI/FI art. And please don't compare it to those horrible Starship Trooper movies. I would love to bitch slap the people who made those.  Buy this you won't regret it!

2412902,2,B000BCCAEQ,"I purchased this set after recently ""discovering"" Firefly, which I thought was superb. If only this show had been created after the Starship Troopers movie and Firefly, I think the writers and directors would have realized how much more they could do with the show. In the end, the characters aren't as intriguing or endearing as Joss Wheadon's characters. The potential was there, but definitely not realized - it's obvious why the show was taken off the air.

I trudged through the entire season and found the show only started becoming entertaining during the last few episodes. The scripts are atrotious, plagued by one-dimentional main charaters, cliche-laden dialogue and plot holes you can drive a truck through.

The overarching storyline is that humans are at war with an advanced alien race. While the viewer is to assume millions of humans are involved in the offensive against the aliens, the story is narrowly situated on a five-man squadron and their CO. Somehow the team evolves from being rookies guarding supply lines to an elite, higly regarded commando squadron over the course of a few episodes, which doesn't make much sense as they don't seem to be involved in any major combat. These five seem to consistently be on their own in what one would assume would be an enormous war. I'm sure these plots kept CGI and extras costs down. Regardless, the writing could've greatly benefited from a grander scope, or at least creating a few dozen more CGI spacefighters so it's not five moderately competent pilots saving the human race.

The special effects/CGI are subpar to what the Star Trek franchise was creating at the time (not a Trekkie, just using it for reference). The actors, while no-names, are all good, though I think better writing and directon could've benefitted their performances.

If you're looking for another ""one season wonder"" like Firefly, this isn't it.",1216425600,5,1893,5.0
2412903,3,B000BCCAEQ,"I caught several episodes of this short lived series and loved it. I had never seen the pilot and, while I believe Sci-Fi picked it up for a short run I still missed most of it.

I like the way the characters developed through the series and the writing, while a little corny in places was generally well done and played by the actors. I like the fact that this wasn't a ""Starship Troopers"" rip-off but a gritty and human look at people in real situations and the problems we face and are able to overcome without coming back and walking through cheering throngs to have the Princess give you a big medal for saving the Universe and everyone lives happily ever after. Soldiers are heros and ""do what they do"" and go home to live the rest of their lives with that experience. They train, fight, and grow as a unit and come to trust each other implicitly regardless of shortcomings and backgrounds.

What I didn't like was the presentation and packaging. Basically I think someone had these on tape, hooked it to a DVD recorder and let it rip. There were no additional goodies in the menus and the packaging was mediocre at best.

That said it was well worth what I paid just to be able to watch the whole series through again. I just wish they hadn't cancelled it so soon.",1216252800,5,1271,4.4

I had slight trouble with the first dvd getting it to play during the final chapter of the first episode.  All other dvd's have had no problem.
The play quality on my dvd player is not perfect.  I think its because my player is not a region 1 player (its multi-region).  Basically there is a slight stutter every hundred frames or so, which makes panning shots very choppy.

Some for the good, others for the bad, still others bond together with the mutual trauma of things constantly faced.

I've read many reviews where folks have compared the make-believe space command ranks and procedures to real military protocals and ranks. It was a TV show. A Fantastic one. A realistic one from a human stand point. Some have made a point that they don't like the titles of the last two episodes: ""If they lay us down to rest,"" and ""tell our moms we done our best."" It's part of a marching cadence learned in basic training:
If they lay us down to rest,
Tell our moms we done our best,
In our coffins we will lie,
Grounded to inspection side.

There is order to everything in the military, even in death. This series lets people have a closer look inside a soldier, even though it's a fantasy program. We see the innocence of the characters leave, replaced by the desire to just survive and go home. And after all the deep insight, it's still a tv show. From a fellow veteran, it's just a tv show.

2412910,4,B000BCCAEQ,"""Space Above and Beyond"" debuted on FOX in 1996. The Show was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of the FOX line up. It followed the FOX formula quirky twist on a tried and true idea (Vic Morrow's Combat in Space). It had the requisite cast of attractive young actors. The Production team that had given Fox's big hit ""The X-Files."" Interesting storylines. Special effect that if not ground breaking were at least acceptable. This show had everything going for it except an audience. After it's debut it plummeted to the basement ratings wise and never caught on. It is both Gritty and campy without being dull and it builds a rather Future including some sort of Robot War, Vegas in Space, ex-vetro humans ( Tanks), Gigantic Carrier Ships, Fighters, Transports and Deep Space Travel and Politics. Given the complexity of the ""SABAB"" universe it would have been interesting to see where the second season would have gone but alas that was not to be. However this 23 episode collection is a great companion for ""Firefly"" and well worth the money. It doesn't have the society through the looking glass scenarios of ""Max Headroom"" the concepts are more elemental soldiers fighting a war far from home I would recommend it",1202860800,,1222,4.796208530805687

Like Firefly which came later, it was a victim of cancellation by Fox executives who continue to prove they don't know good SF much less good shows. Aside from the nostalgia factor, Space Above and Beyond stands the test of time. The writing is strong and the characters are all unique and engaging. One can also see where the new BSG borrowed a lot of their gritty and ""in the trenches"" look. That said, some aspects of the show were a bit painful to watch: The CGI special effects looked clumsy; some ordinary SFX and ""high tech"" props were plain bad; the action set pieces were at times badly choreographed and amateurish. The pilot and first two or three episodes were especially plagued by these issues. After that, production values seemed to have increased.

And what is their job... are they fighter pilots, special ops or grunts? Shouldn't they be doing more training if they do this many jobs?

After watching a few episodes I have to say I'm a little dissapointed. It's a little more corny than I recall and the stories are rather thin plotwise. Not bad but definately not great.",1187308800,3,446,4.01123595505618
2412944,3,B000BCCAEQ,"I joined Blockbuster Online to watch the entire James Bond Series, and after I completed that mission, I decided that I wanted to complete this series. When Space first aried in 1995, I only saw the first few episodes and then went off to college and didn't get to watch the rest of the season. Now with DVD I finally had my chance. I just completed watching the entire series in sequence.

The first episode was a great start to the series. The premise was excellent: a marine squadron who flies starfighters and carriers, as well as does ground combat duty, for Earth forces waging war against a newly discovered alien race, with InVitros and Silicates in the mix. And throughout the series, I felt most of the actors were pretty good, except Rodney Rowland (Cooper Hawkes) - he was an awful actor, and one of the producers even admitted it in an old issue of Starlog I still have. He was the obvious choice to play the InVitro squadmate, but wasn't really even good enough for that.

But a great start, premise, and some decent actors were not enough. Over the course of the series, the quality was very inconsistent from episode to episode. Some episodes were good ideas that were poorly written or produced (and acted in the case of Rodney Rowland). Some things just appeared in one lame episode and then were abandoned, like Damphousse's physic intuition. Some episodes didn't have any redeeming qualities at all.

Well, at least I can say I gave it a shot from start to finish. People can make up a lot of excuses for the show, and sure the show could have somewhat performed better if the TV factors were different. I am dissappointed that the main reason the series died is because it was mediocre at best. Sadly there isn't enough interest to revive/revamp this show in the form of a modern movie (with modern effects), or even another TV series.

But since the idea is great and the Chig War is left unresolved, I think the DVD series would make a great premise for a roleplaying game (table-top, pen, paper & dice). If that game came out then I would suggest the gamemaster watch the series to prepare for running the game. Otherwise, I can't reccommend this series.",1186531200,2,2178,4.591259640102828

This series was very well done and had a great, gritty feel to it. I loved space marines. It was like a TV series with Quake/Doom/Halo characters in it. It had a good concept and great story. The actors weren't that bad either.

One gripe I had about the set as a whole is the lackluster packaging job that Fox did on the DVDs. Fox didn't even spare the extra few cents to print extra DVDs, and instead printed DVDs double-sided. The inserts are lame too. The show had a huge cliff-hanger of an end to the first and only season. I guess we'll never know what happened with all those stories.",1184544000,3,703,4.366412213740458

2412948,3,B000BCCAEQ,"On the surface, this series was very appealing to me--I am a former U. S. Marine and a huge sci-fi fan.  Unfortunately, the writers of this show don't know ANYTHING about the Marine Corps; rank structure, training processes, anything.  There isn't even a single incident of nautical jargon until halfway through the series--which is especially disappointing, since R. Lee Ermy has a major role in the first episode.
Rather, all military references seem to be taken from the Army, or from a soldier's (poor) understanding of Naval procedure.  For example, one of the Marine pilots is promoted to captain, and is elated that she will finally be able to use the ""Captains'"" restroom aboard the naval space carrier upon which she serves.  Unfortuantely, a Naval Captain is three ranks higher than a Marine Corps Captain; the equivalent of a Marine Colonel.
The sci-fi element is equally disappointing; the advanced alien race which we are fighting apparently uses the same tactics as North Korean and Viet Cong troops in 20th century Terrestrial warfare; the only difference being that their weapons have a bigger ""boom.""

He was told that if he successfully completed his mission, the rest of his sentence would be wiped and he could then leave the unit.

I watched this series as re-runs on the Sci-Fi Channel in the late nineties, so I saw everything out of order. At the time, I liked the feel of several episodes and thought the show had potential. That being the case, after becoming a Blockbuster Online subscriber, I wanted to re-visit this show to see if it was as good as I remembered.

In short, after watching the new Battlestar Galactica, ""Space"" is super cheese. However, I enjoy seeking the redeeming qualities of any given show and this show has a few, Kristen Cloak (Vansen) being one of them.

The idea for the series is decent, being that the producers went for a grittier, dirtier action-sci-fi look and feel, but somehow it gets off on the wrong foot with flow and development. Just about the time I saw the potential for a longer story arc, it was cancelled. What could have saved it was a nice girl-on-girl tryst between Vansen and Damphousse, but that's just me.

If you have been tainted by the new Battlestar Galactica, you probably won't appreciate this series. Overall, it's a decent time-killer, if you've run out of other things to watch and have finished your two page to-do list that begins with cleaning out the garage and ends with getting a vasectomy.

The show also has some cool guest stars like David Duchovny.

The Video and Audio look are up to scratch, but the set is lacking in extras, apart from some TV Spots.

The set is nicely packaged, but a booklet with some info on the show would have been nice. I definitely like the thin packs, but not the Dual Sided discs, however this doesn't affect the bitrate used, as most of the discs have two episodes per side.

2413010,4,B000BCCAEQ,"This was one of the better series of its time and was vastly under-appreciated.  The acting, while often a bit over the top, was not so out of line for the genre.

It was about overcoming the fear of the unknown as well as the fear of the perceived, racism, Political Correctness, and the need to always be RIGHT!

The characters were well drawn, human, with flaws which not only endeared them but made them fallible and believable.  As with all allegories, much is simplified and repeated.  Themes are played out again and again.  Those who do not trust tend to not trust, etc.  The ""tank"" goes from asserting aggressively that he has no human emotions to knowing what it means to be and have a friend.

While it ain't perfect, it is certainly worth seeing and deserved a better fate (and a longer run) than it got.  Another two or three years and it could have been one of the best Sci-fi series of all time.  But such was not to be.  Tucker Smallwood is a jewel!",1168387200,,965,4.365168539325842

I enjoyed them, was sad to hear the show had been cancelled, and always hoped to one day be able to see the series in its entirety. When I saw that the DVD had been released I was estactic. That having been said, I watched the pilot, it was HORRIBLE, as pilots generally are, but this was even worse than could have been imagined. The main characters were completely miscast and unsympathetic: the skinny male lead glaring with jaws constantly clenched in resolution acting the part of the tough guy when its obvious he's a nancy. The female squad leader who assumes control for no apparent reason, has all of the answers and leads with laughable shouts of military decisiveness, a third white male who plays the obligatory renegade to the aforementioned and is obviously the odd man out when it comes to the romantic competition. Two token minorities whose only roles are to make the other three look good with a laughably weak black female playing the runt of the litter, only there to ask her superiors whats going on and to make black women look absoultely insipid. The incompetent black commodore who is always showed up by his second in command in a nod to those who have been offended by affirmative action. It goes on and on.

Note:The odd thing about racism in this country is that no white people admit that it exists,and predictably very few who read this review will have any idea what I'm talking about. This show is a monument to white supremacy and the ignorance of its pervasivness.

But beyond all of this(which only deals with the first 9 episodes, I just can't watch anymore), the show is just SO STUPID! If you find watching anglicized asians prove their middle class bona fides by constantly and obsequiously refering to Chicago sports quaint, get these DVDs. If you like watching square jawed nancys

talk back to their superiors with righteuos indignation(and get away with it) while they quest for and find captured girlfriends by chance on the other end of the galaxy get this DVD.The show is an emptiness, you only watch it hoping it will get better, and through the first 9 episodes, it doesnt. I have read here that the main characters are killed off in the final episode. I'll probably watch their presumably heroic demise and leave it at that. The fact that this show was cancelled after its first season, shows that maybe there is hope for this country after all.",1160697600,10,2474,4.65675057208238

The new ""Battlestar Galactica"" has slipped alot of ""similar"" material from this series into their show. And BG feels alot more like SAB than it does the original BG.  If you like that, you will like this show.

The show was well done (for a 90's show) and it is a true shame it did not go past 1 season thanks to FOX for not seeing things thru and being concerned about immediate results instead of seeing things thru. Most shows truly do not hit the big time till the 2nd season, rarely is it the first. This is one of the very few shows during the last 10 or so years that I liked and tried though I failed to watch on a normal basis, though I never owned a TV.

As far as DVD sets go I cannot say I like the dual sided disc. The packaging is fine as I prefer the less flashy anyway. The menu screens are simple and basic and are quickly navigated, big bonus for me! Most DVD sets try to make it way to fancy and you spend minutes just to navigate to a show with all those bells and whistles first.

Very grainy in most scenes, even film lines in some areas. But as the series continues, it seems like the quality improves, which means I'm either getting used to it, or the show got a higher budget and was able to improve on things; and yes, I know this show, and therefore the technology, is 10 years old.

Another Series that I love is the New Battlestar Galactica series, they have a nice blend of Ground, Space, Interaction of the Characters on the Ship. It blends well, and is very entertaining.

I tried to Love Space Above and Beyond but in my opinion, there wasn't hardly any ""Space"" ""Above"" or ""Beyond"". Perhaps the show didn't satisfy my particular taste, or perhaps this is why it is no longer a show...

2413056,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Please note, The Amazon.com review is incorrect: '...Nathan West (Morgan Weisser) has joined the Marines to save a girlfriend captured by the aliens...' - West, in fact, joins in hopes that by becoming a Colonial guard he will be stationed near the Tellus colony he and his girlfriend had planned on settling together; A sudden attempt at segregation by substituting invitro-born humans for some of the ""colonists"" forces West and his girlfriend to choose which one of them goes, and which one stays. At the time of their decision, there is no war; West is well into Marine training when the planned Tellus colony is destroyed, some of it's inhabitants missing, most killed. Following this, early into his service, West's main objective is to get to Tellus, to find his girlfriend, and he makes bad decisions to do so. This would be a tiresome theme had it continued longer than it did, but West eventually comes to grips with his duty, and accepts what he cannot control.

I have not had the chance to see S:AAB since it originally aired (some episodes I missed due to work schedule and Faux messing with timeslots)- and I gambled on wanting the box set, fearing sentimentality and poor memory made it better in my mind than it was. When I began watching the Pilot for the first time since September of '95, I admit it horrified me. The writing was overly melodramatic, the acting brutally corny, the premise contrived and the effects poor. My thought, repeated painful scene after painful scene was 'Oh God, what were they *thinking*?' Creators/Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong, some of the finest talent from the X-files, surely could not have written this....

However, in taking the pilot as it may have been meant, expository for the benefit of pitching the series to network, I saw it through to the end. In hindsight, I also realize the pilot may have been written to mirror the war movies of old, so strongly were the stereotypes played; I understand the attempt, even if I found it silly to watch. I would not recommend skipping the pilot to anyone who has not seen the series yet, because the backstory is important - although certain points are touched on more than once thoughout the series, it is a very linear storyline, and the first step in the character's development.

I give this set a strong four stars because despite some occasionally uninteresting episodes it is hard to not be drawn into the series, as I was over ten years ago. Portrayed well is the morality of war, from the point of view of the enlisted. These are people who chose the Corp, although they do not necessarily want to kill they understand the importance of the fight. Some want glory, some want opportunity, some join because they feel service is the right thing, and some join because they don't know what else to do. Despite their personal feelings of like or dislike, however, they are all dedicated to duty. I find this compelling, although 10+ years ago it may have seemed a romantic notion, compaired to today's media barrage of ""the poor, victimized soldier""; There are no bleeding hearts here - Nathan West could have become the most annoying of characters, but he easily evolves into one of the most interesting. Having known many Marines in my life, the kind of people these friends and family of mine are, S:AAB's p.o.v. does not seem far off the mark.

This series is not perfect, but so few of them are. Taken as a whole, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction, without much science involved. (Also, for X-files fans, there are a few nods to the mytharc in that series. Nothing you can live without, but still cool. David Duchovny's appearance as an AI appears to be a rating grab for sweeps, more than anything.)

This box set loses the 5th star, as many before me have noted, because of the *lack* of extras. Most infuriating, like The X-files boxes, because you cannot convince me there is NOTHING in the way of supplemental material available to add. Commentary is nice, when it adds insight into the story, and with a series cut short like this one, some closure would have been appreciated - the final episode helps some with that, but curiousity is still left unsatisfied. Also noted by others, the double sided discs *are* irritating. I'm not so lazy that I can't walk to the player to flip the disc, but I was almost to disc five - and wondering why I had not seen some episodes I remembered - before I discovered this.

The video playback is good, and what little digital effects there are progress in quality as the series advances. Effects are not the point, however, because this is a human story. I am sorry it was cancelled, but I am glad I am able to see it again, and appreciate it for what it was. If you know someone who owns the set, ask to borrow it. If you like it, buy it; If you don't like it, it didn't cost you a dime.

I would recommened this series to anyone looking for something they can watch with encroaching-on-teenage children. There are strong military themes, violence, and language. Taken in context with the subject matter, however, these things are not as gratuitious as they seem, but young children may be disturbed by it.",1152316800,11,5190,4.647058823529412
2413057,5,B000BCCAEQ,"""Space: Above and Beyond"" begins in the 2060s, and follows 5 young Americans who are undergoing accelerated officer training for the United States Marine Corps Space Aviator Cavalry.  These people all have different reasons for joining the Marines in peacetime:

- In hopes of rejoining a lost love: Nathan West (Morgan Weisser)

- Carrying on a family tradition: Shane Vansen (Kristen Cloke)

- As an alternative to prison: Cooper Hawkes (Rodney Rowland)

- The military paid for engineering school: Vanessa Damphousse (Lanei Chapman)

- To escape a life of poverty: Paul Wang (Joel de la Fuente)

Except for spacecraft rather than aircraft and different-looking guns, little is changed from today's U.S. Marines.  The uniforms are very similar; ""every man a rifleman"" is still the dictum.

What's new in 2063:

The U.N. is running world politics, but individual countries control their own military.  Faster-than-light travel is available, although it's very expensive so commercial use is mostly directed through naturally-occurring wormholes.  Two fledgling colonies have been established in other solar systems.  There was a war with A.I. androids (""silicates""), and they departed Earth.  Tank-grown human clones (""tanks"") were developed to form troops to fight against the silicates.

As these new officer candidates near the end of their training the peace ends, suddenly, when a previously unknown enemy (the ""Chigs"") destroys the two extraterrestrial human colonies and captures many of the colonists, including Nathan West's fiance.

While S:AaB featured a great deal of emphasis on accurately depicting military life, there was little emphasis on accurately depicting physics.  Space helmets don't seal at the neck.  You hear sounds of flight and battle in a vacuum.  Small solar cell arrays power large vehicles.  Space fighters thrust continuously to get to their targets, and bank for turns.  This is all bunk, of course, but don't let that put you off the series.  Despite the future setting, S:AaB is almost exclusively a war show rather than a science fiction series.  As a war show the series excelled, and its roster of largely unknown actors did an excellent job of portraying young people forced to become battle veterans at a frantic pace.

Just as the original Star Trek series used SF metaphors to highlight current 1960s events, S:AaB uses the fight with the ""Chigs"" to illustrate recurring themes of war:

o Demonization of a poorly-understood enemy

o Prejudice in the military mirroring prejudice in the larger society

o Large corporation with a hidden agenda, profiting from the war

o Sneaky politicians using skulduggery to further their personal aims

o Psychological warfare

o Wounded soldiers striving to return to combat

o Making friends, then losing them in battle

o Younger brother volunteering for the war

o Glory-hound commander putting his troops at risk needlessly

o Separation from family

o Interaction with different branches of the military

o Fraternization with fellow soldiers

o Problems with not enough R&R, followed by problems disengaging from R&R

o Being cut off and left without support for extended periods

o Deciding whether natives are bystanders or enemy supporters

The 5 young members of the 58th Squadron are augmented by their commander, Lt. Col. T.C. McQueen (James Morrison).  Recurring roles include Tucker Smallwood as Commodore Glen Ross, Tasia Valenza as Lt. Kelly Winslow, and Harriet Sansom Harris as Ambassador/U.N. President Diane Hayden.

The DVD collection of S:AaB includes the double-length pilot plus 22 more ""hour"" (45 minute) episodes, on 5 double-sided DVDs.  Discs 1 & 5 ""A"" sides hold 4 45-minute segments each; all the others hold 2 segments/side.  Since they obviously could have done the whole thing as 4 segments per side, there's no reason for the doubled-sided discs except to make production cheaper.

The extras are restricted to the FOX promotional advertisement spots.  There are no commentaries.  In fact, no material at all was produced after the series ended in 1996.

""Space: Above and Beyond"" suffered the usual FOX treatment for science fiction shows.  It was shuffled around the 1995-1996 broadcast schedule, and a new series intro was introduced halfway through the season.  You'll also note that there are many more promo spots included before the pilot aired than for the last 3/4 of the series run.  (Once FOX decides a show isn't a hit, it's pretty much doomed to failure from then on.)

The two-part series ender (""If They Lay Us Down to Rest ..."" and ""... Tell Our Moms We Done Our Best"") was obviously finished knowing that the series was already, or likely to be, cancelled.  This ends with one of our 58th Squadron stars killed in action, two missing, and one wounded.  The two remaining soldiers lie down in their bunks, staring at the ceiling and bleakly contemplating their loss.  I'm sure that's a metaphor for how show creators Glen Morgan and James Wong reacted to the demise of S:AaB.

Despite the shabby FOX treatment, both in its original airing and on this DVD set, I recommend ""Space: Above and Beyond"" highly.",1151366400,18,5138,5.1761846901579585

2413060,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Yes, the wording is important in the title. Can't give more than a 4 star rating 'cause of the packaging and the way the DVD's were distributed, or the features (what features?).

Well, if they gave half points I'd go with 3.5 stars, but no such luck. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt 'cause I like the show and would like more people to see and like the show.

Long and short of it: double-sided discs are a no-no! I hate double-sided discs. I really do. Sure, you can cut costs slightly on discs and packaging by double-siding discs, but c'mon, they justl ook like cheaply burned copies. Is that any way to treat a venerable show like S:AAB? I think not. Besides, that's two sides of the disc you have to worry about cleaning and keeping fingerprints off. No easy task!

The packaging was okay, but nothing special, with double-disc cases. Kept the size to a reasonable 3 cases + box which has a small shelf footprint. Still... I wouldn't have minded if they'd single-sided the discs, put some nice art on the discs and gone with 5 double-disc slim cases. Wouldn't have impacted the shelf footprint much, and would have looked a lot nicer.

In terms of features, well, what features? The discs are pretty bare episodes. I forget if they had trailer for the episodes or not? The ""features"" were pretty non-existent.

All that aside, the video and audio were wonderful, and the show, well the show was always great! I wish Fox had kept it on for one more season, and I wish they'd wrapped up the first season a little more neatly than they did. Nothing like having a cliff-hanger be the season/series finale. *Sigh*

Still, if you like space sci-fi and military-type dramas with a little futurism thrown in, you'll probably like the series. Pick it up. One of my many personal favorites.",1148601600,11,1794,4.573208722741433
2413061,4,B000BCCAEQ,"I hated the computer graphics in this at the time, though now it ironically doesn't bother me as much, and also the Battlestar Gallactica (original series) aspect of having the same soldiers both flying aircraft and fighting on the ground.  That's a bit wanky strategy, but it's good for TV.  I agree the music cues sometimes seem arbitrary.  The acting, or more accurately the direction and choosing of which takes to print, is what I'd call schmaltzy, especially the early episodes.  The writing lacks subtlety;  rarely is anything just implied.  Mostly this series was not great, but it never felt compromised to me from the standpoint of giving into top-down pressures.  Though the visuals may be limited, the writers seemed able to get their stories across without corruption.  It's worth persevering through those first few awkward, obvious, forced episodes.  ""Who Monitors the Birds"", an episode where Tank is part of a 2-man SPECOPs insertion, could even stand alone as a short film.  There are lots of little well-thought-out technical details like using LADAR for secure communications with scout ships.  Obviously there was more practical advising, not just technical but in all areas, for this show than, say, any of the Star Treks.  You don't see much interchangeable, throwaway techno-babble here.  The score was also unique in that it was composed by a woman...very rare for TV/Film, even more so with science fiction/military subject matter.

I'd also like to commend this series for the emotional characteristics of the soldiers.  I've seen enough footage of the young, closely-knit US ground troops in Iraq & Afghanistan, their heartbreak, and their tears with the death of friends not, to discount what was trying to be honestly conveyed in that particular respect.  The Marines' portrayal here is maybe not as gung-ho, jarheaded, and testosterone as the real life Corps (and it has its share), but you must keep in mind that this series is based on a total war, with both male and female enlisted (without MOS sex restrictions) of all economic backgrounds. Here the Navy is the primary ""Space Force"" service branch, with the Marines encompassing all the space-borne soldier/pilots.  It's hard to know what such a personnel makeup would be like.  The young, female sergeant is too frequently either angry or on the verge of tears, but that might just be the range of the actress.  If young women were leading squads/flights in a war this big, I suppose you can't rule anything out.  The Russian front in WWII, where women served alongside men, had its share of melodrama and sexual tension...so who really knows.  From a warfighting standpoint, as long as they can do the job, a little PMS isn't a deal breaker.  The fact that the show even allowed this to come through at times might be a good sign of their artistic integrity.  And of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fascinating character Elroy-El.  Doug Hutchison never disappoints.  I'm pleased to see this entire series available for such a low price.",1144886400,11,3039,4.982142857142857

If you are a fan, you already bought this and don't need to read the review. If you are not a fan and you want a glimpse at a truly unique show, read on...

The formula for Space: Above and Beyond seemed just that at the time: formulaic. Earth thinks it is alone, they start colonizing nearby stars, and then they are attacked by aliens and the ensuing war is the main plot device for the show. BUT...

Because this show comes form two veterans of ""The X-Files,"" things rapidly become more complex. Glen Morgan and James Wong take us on a season long look at the military industrial complex, conspiracies, political machinations, military intelligence and their attempts to subvert the enemy,  racial discrimination, and if that weren't enough, they also attempt to answer two age-old questions: ""Why do we fight?"" and ""What would you die for?""

Slickly produced and expensive for its time because of the effects, ""S:AAB"" as fans call it was bumped around the schedule mercilessly by Fox and unsurprisingly cancelled when it failed to find an audience. Too bad, because in spite of it's somewhat unrealistic portrayal of the military, the producers were on to a good thing. The storytelling was superb, and the outstanding acting was complimented by the fact that all of the principals were largely unknown.

As far as the DVD release is concerned, it gets an overall C+. The video is adequate and the audio is pristine. However, lack of commentary from Morgan or Wong or any actors as well as the fact that the set was burned onto two-sided discs seriously detract from what could have been a superb set. On the plus side, the menus are elegantly simple with scene selection available, and there is Spanish and French captioning as well as English. All of the network promos are also included.

If you want a good taste of the episodes without getting involved in the story arc, try to check out the episode ""R & R"" which has appearances by David Duchovny as the sinsister android Alvin; Janet Gunn as a genetically engineered prostitute; and Coolio as the emcee of the pleasure ship ""Bacchus."" Another highlight was the episode ""Stay with the Dead,"" which explores war from the viewpoint of someone seriously wounded in battle. Perhaps the best episode of the set is the Christmas episode entitled ""River of Stars."" The contrast in the opening scenes is intense and will grab you full on.

So do what the silicates in the show tell you to do and:

Both science fiction and war drama, ""Space: Above and Beyond"" hold its own when compared with the best produced in either category.

The cast is first-rate -- each actor shines in superbly realized roles.  Through the course of the show's two seasons, each actor's character seems to have been featured in an episode, and all gave standout performances...performances that were courageous and exhilarating and performances that were intensely moving.

The writing of each episode was intelligent and thought-provoking and true to the overall mission of the Marine squadron sent into the furthest reaches of space to fight a vastly superior enemy.

2413110,4,B000BCCAEQ,"**Minor spoilers ahead**

The science fiction club that I help to run at my university enjoys watching episodes from well known sci-fi shows.  In the past, we have showed episodes from Stargate SG-1, and more recently, we've watched episodes from Farscape and the new Battlestar Galactica series.  When I pulled out my Space: Above and Beyond DVD's, the initial reaction of almost all our club members was...Space: what?  Yes, the unfortunate fact is that many science fiction fans out there have not seen this great show.  However, when I showed them the Pilot episode, and the 2-parter with the Chig stealth fighter, everyone in attendance thought it was great.  Also, many remarked that they simply could not fathom why Fox would cancel this show after only one season.  I couldn't agree more.

Created by Glen Morgan and James Wong, Space: Above and Beyond is one of the grittiest shows ever made for television.  The series follows the exploits of the United States Marine Corps 58th Squadron, and their battles against an alien species called the Chigs, who started a war with Earth after attacking two Earth colonies.  The squadron is lead by Lt. Col. McQueen, an Invitro (artificially gestated human), who leads the 58th after the squadron he originally lead was destroyed by the Chigs.  Other members include Nathan West, whose girlfriend was on one of the colony ships when it was attacked, Shane Vansen, whose parents were military officers that were killed by the AI's (androids who rebelled against the human race), and Cooper Hawkes, an Invitro who was sentenced to service in the Marine Corps.

One of the main reasons why I loved this show so much is that it is completely different from a lot of science fiction shows (and television shows in general).  Even though it is a sci-fi show at heart, it also attempts to re-create the feeling and drama of many war movies and TV shows.  Also, this show is not like Star Trek: The Next Generation, where every character has almost no flaws in their personalities.  The characters in Space: Above and Beyond are very ""human"".  Nathan only joined the Corps for the possibility that he could be with his girlfriend.  One time, when the opportunity arose to look for her, Nathan illegally took a space fighter into enemy territory in a vain attempt to find her.  Cooper often had to endure racist insults because he is an Invitro, and has butted head with other soldiers because of that.  Personally, my favourite character is Lt. Col. McQueen (played by James Morrison).  He is a person who cares deeply about those under his command (although he tends not to show it), yet at the same time he is willing to risk their lives (and his) if it will get the mission done.  McQueen, as depicted in one episode, is also a person who tried to have a ""normal"" life (i.e. a wife and children), but couldn't.  As such, he decided to devote his entire self to the service of the Marine Corps.

Another great aspect of this show was the amazing battle scenes in space.  Seeing human and Chig fighters battling it out in the depths of space is truly a sight to behold.  Also, I have to give some kudos to the computer animators of this show, because even though this Space: Above and Beyond is a decade old, many of its special effects still stand the test of time.  My only complaint with this show (and it's a minor one) is that some of the ground combat scenes could have been better choreographed.  Although these scenes were good overall, there were a couple of episodes where the ground combat looked a little stilted.  Again, this is a minor complaint.

As for the DVD set itself, while I am happy that this show came out on DVD at all, I was a little disappointed with the slim extras that were included in the set.  Aside from a few TV spots, there is really nothing extra included in this set.  As many people have already stated, this set could have definitely benefited from features such as a ""making of"" documentary, or audio commentary from the show's creators and actors.  Personally, I don't see why Fox could not have taken the time to include features such as these on the set.

In the end, Space: Above and Beyond was another in a long string of TV shows on Fox that were cancelled before its time.  It was unlike any show on TV at the time, and looking back, that may be one of its downfalls.  Perhaps people were expecting something more Star Trek-ish (please note I like Star Trek too), but were turned off by the series' darker tone.  It's a crying shame that this show was not picked up for another season.  Whether you're a fan of science fiction, drama, and/or war movies, if you have never seen this series at all, I urge you to pick it up.  Just like the people in my club who have never seen this show before, I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised.

The DVD set is absolutely bare bones, with nothing but the episodes themselves to offer. The thing I haven't heard anyone else mention is the bizarre fact that the main menu screens on the discs feature Babylon 5 itself in the top right corner. Whaa?!!!???",1136678400,2,492,4.788235294117647
2413126,5,B000BCCAEQ,"1995 was a great year for sci-fi buffs over here in Britain, Babylon 5 was in full swing, this was followed by the excellent American Gothic and there was a buzz in the air about a new series that was about to start on BBC2. It was already popular over in the States and was brought to the screen courtesy of Morgan and Wong (the team behind The X Files).  This show was Space: Above and Beyond.

As with the other shows, S:a+b was slotted into the schedules ridiculously late to allow room for sport and reruns of vintage comedies on a Friday night but like many loyal fans I stayed up religiously to watch it every week and I wasn't disappointed with a single episode, not one!

The show, at a glance could be linked to the likes of 'Starship Troopers', with the marines pitted against bug like aliens called 'chigs' in the far reaches of space, but it is altogether more gritty, sacrificing blatent gore for character driven storylines allowing every one of the mains a moment in the spotlight.  Don't get me wrong, it can get bloody when needed but just enough for realism.

Time for some Space:Above and Beyond 101 - it's the second half of the twenty first century - man has started to colonise other planets.  Back on Earth, the A.I.s were created (artificial policemen to keep the population in check).  A computer virus (take a chance) drove them mad and they left for space.  In Vitros (Humans grown in large tanks) were created to fight these A.Is who were now plundering the galaxy obsessed with risk taking and chaos.  After being treated abominably the In Vitros also rebelled (does anyone else see a pattern here) but were given 'rights' and the platoons were dispanded.

It's here where we join up with the series and the 58th squadron (also known as 'The Wild Cards'), each marine has a reason for joining the corp or a back story, which are too long to get into at this stage but what I can say is there's a healthy mixture of In Vitros and natural born humans thrown together and forced to put past grievences and prejudices aside when just days after the completion of their training, an intergalactic war breaks out, up to a point its all very 'Topgun' in space but it expands on this from ariel battles to ground assaults and back again.  The show is rivetting from its quiet beginnings to its emotional 'wild bunch' style series finale (not giving too much away, there are losses, it's quite devastating)!  Since you care about all the characters, its worse.  There's romance and intrigue, there's heartache and also some lighter moments, there's life lessons to be learnt, I could go on for ever but I won't, I'll just say, WATCH IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!

Like American Gothic, Space: Above and Beyond was cancelled too soon. It finished and left a lot of people wanting more.  The boxset also unfortunately shows similarities.  The special features are non-existant and the discs are double-sided, but like I said with the other series, it doesn't matter, the show is what counts and after ten long years I can be proud to say it's in my collection, A MUST WATCH FOR ALL SCI-FI FANS!

2413127,4,B000BCCAEQ,"There are many things to like about Space Above and Beyond. The characters were interesting and well drawn. And the background story was reasonably well-thought out (although they set it at least 50 years too soon). There were good production values and, by and large, reasonably good acting.

So, why oh why couldn't they spend a few bucks and hire a junior high science teacher as a science advisor. That's all it would have taken. At the very least, the science teacher could have told them how big the universe is and explained other basic points to them. The science in this show was awful. Yes, I know it's fiction, and for most shows I can overlook some science errors (Star Trek has its share). But Space Above and Beyond errors were so bad that at times they became distracting.

Overall, though, there are enough positive features about this series that it's worth watching. I wish there had been another season.",1136332800,3,922,4.720496894409938

They couldn't just exchange them at the store, nooooooooooooooo I had to get my money back from the online store.  I quit buying from ""Worst Buy"" right there and then.

2413130,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Space: Above and Beyond was a show full of potential and, like many other shows, especially on Fox, met it's end before all the potential could be realized.

Following a unit of Marines/Pilots on a space carrier set in 2063, the story begins when Earth goes to war with an advanced alien race.

Each character is completely different and well developed. You won't get one confused with another at any time, and each has their own driving force which is explored in different episodes. You watch as the characters evolve, going through ups and downs and growing each episode.

The writers, the same as the X-Files and Millenium, continued their in depth story telling with this series. They make the right mix of action and drama to keep you entertained through the whole episode, and the single season that was made. Sadly, the series ended in a cliff hanger and on a story arc that would have promised a great second season.

The the real life effects (ie. guns and other props) are believable and do have a semi-futuristic feel. The CG is a bit sub-par for the time, but is good enough and won't take away from enjoying the scenes. The soundtrack has a military theme (drums and trumpets) but has a modern feel, making it a perfect fit for the series.

Not much effort was really put into the DVD's sadly. Packaging is ok at best, and there are no extras, which is very sad. A behind the scenes look, or even just interviews with the writers would have been good.

Space: Above and Beyond is a good series that wasn't given the chance it deserved. Being ten years older now, I find myself liking the series more this time around than when it aired because I can appreciate the character and plot depth much more. I really wish this series had continued, and it gives me yet another reason to shake my head at Fox executives.",1135814400,5,1826,4.5349544072948325
2413131,5,B000BCCAEQ,"When I first started watching the series in '96 I thought it was just going to be another hoo-yar marines in space shoot em up. But I was wrong. I soon realised the characterisations were outstanding and each story is a unique stand alone which always manages to move either the main story or understanding of each character forward. The series soon developes far beyond the shoot em up and the twists and turns of a complex plot begin to unravel until by the end you start to see what an eye-opener it is and no wonder Fox exectuives weren't ineterested in a second series. But the interest in the DVD since it recently became available must have even shown them how short-sighted and wrong they were not to commission another.

Update: Amazon replaced the set and it plays well. I read elsewhere on the Web that the DVD manufacturer for this set is not the best.  Love the series.  The pilot is hard to take, then the series just gets better and better.  ""Who Monitors the Birds?"" and ""River of Stars"" are B+ movie quality, the first may even be an A.  I too am a Firefly fan.

2413133,4,B000BCCAEQ,"I'm taking away one star just because of the complete lack of extras on the dvd.  Normally, I wouldn't do that with an excellent show like this.  However, I REALLY wanted to find out what they would have done with the show if there had been a second season (which there should have been, but oh, hey - it was on Fox, so no).  The only way to find out would have been through a dvd commentary, which we didn't get.  Anyway, the show as a whole was excellent.  As a war show, in the vein of Combat or The Rat Patrol (which will also be released on dvd sometime early next year), it was excellent and carried on that fine tradition.  In the more general category of space-based sci-fi, it also stands up quite well - not quite as great as Firefly or the new Battlestar Galactica, but better than most other shows.  The CGI effects really date it sometimes.  A lot of the CGI shots are really fake looking compared to what is being done now.  But, hey, that's just technology.  The acting on the show was excellent and the writing, while not as uniformly excellent as Firefly or Galactica, was mostly good.  The only warning I have for potential purchasers is that the one season you get on this dvd leaves more questions asked than answered.  The show was excellent as far as it went, but if you can't stand being left without resolution to some important story lines, you might want to skip this one.  I bought it anyway and am quite happy with it, except for that almost complete lack of resolution (one really important story line was resolved, but many others weren't).  Damn Fox.",1133913600,7,1581,4.406896551724138
2413134,5,B000BCCAEQ,"The first few episodes are kind of slow but afterwards the show really finds its feet. The show follows 6 Marine Corps space aviators in the year 2063, during a war with an alien invader who has (seemingly) launched an unprovoked attack on Earth Colonies in another solar system.

Gritty, dark and realistic this show doesn't rely on ""particles of the week"" or technobabble like lots of other Sci-Fi. Everything from the sets to the props to the uniforms is very close to gear you would expect to find in the modern military but with a slightly more advanced look. Spacecraft fly as they should ships that do a 180-degree turn will keep moving along their original direction. Although a few science concessions have been made to the average viewer that really don't degrade on the primary focus of the show- the characters.

Throughout the show we see just how a real life war taxes solders. Morale dips and soars, characters question if they can win and why they are fighting. Despite the greater enemy the characters clash on several occasions and even ignore the greater good for their own needs.

The final two episodes really leave you hanging but I have heard that the show's creators didn't intend for it to be an end of season cliffhanger but a clean end to the first season. Even if that's so it really needed and deserved a second season to continue the story.

There were a few problems with the disk 1s in the first run of the set. I have had the honor of exchanging three sets before I got a good set. But it looks like they have final worked the bugs out. The set isn't of exceptional quality but it gets the job done. Having only two or three episodes on each side of the DVD is annoying and leads to an odd number of disks (5) but just having this show on my shelf is worth dealing with every minor problem.

At least one report on the Space: Above and Beyond fan discussion boards attests that the new sets from Amazon work fine.  To the best of my knowledge, Best Buy and other stores are still selling the original release with the problems on disc one, or at least have made no effort to get them off the shelves to distinguish them from new corrected sets.

2413148,4,B000BCCAEQ,"""Space: Above and Beyond"" was a show that would probably feel more relevant today than when it debuted in 1995, given the current military actions going on in the world at this time.  The show was always a war drama first, and a science-fiction show second, which was the intent of series creators Glen Morgan and James Wong.  The ensemble cast or relative unknown actors that made up the 58th Squadron (Morgan Weisser, Kristen Cloke, Rodney Rowland, Joel de la Fuente, and Lanei Chapman) formed a very strong chemistry on-screen, which contributed to their overall performance.  Sure some of the episodes are rather cheesy, and the special effects do feel a little dated, but this was overall a character-based show, and Morgan and Wong, as well as the cast, did a wonderful job of bringing those characters to life, giving them a humanity that could be connected to by the viewing audience (which in turn makes the final episode still painful to watch).  Morgan and Wong were also not afraid to push the envelope when it came to the show, notably the ""Who Monitors the Birds?"" episode, which contained very little dialogue (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" would copy this a couple of years later to rave reviews).  The show's cast and creators also had a strong rapport with it's Internet fan base, and many episodes later in the series were filled with little in-jokes and references to the online community.  In fact, if the Internet was as strong a presence in 1995-1996 as it is today, the show might not have been cancelled (although it might not have mattered since the show was pretty much buried to make room for ""Millennium"", but that's another story).

If I was reviewing ""Space: Above and Beyond"" as just the show itself, it would get a 5-star rating hands down, but I have to bring it down a star for the DVD because it's so skimpy when it could have been so much more (word has it that Morgan and Wong had approached Fox about doing some special features for the DVD, even paying for it themselves, but Fox pretty much blew them off).  In that sense, I am grateful to have the show finally released on DVD (and even more grateful that the DVD set I bought was free from the defects that seem to be running rampant.  I have not had any noticeable problems with disc 1 freezing during episodes 1 or 2, and I have a fairly old Memorex player.  Maybe I just got lucky, and at least it sounds like Fox is willing to swap out the bad discs.).

This was a tremendous show that had real heart and promise.  Unfortunately, it was cancelled long before it should have been, and it's been given a rather cheap DVD treatment.  While there are no real extras to speak of, just having the show on DVD is satisfying enough.",1129593600,26,2718,4.5564681724846
2413149,3,B000BCCAEQ,"I absolutely loved this show when it first aired and was as upset as anyone when it was canceled.  In all honesty though, it could have met a much worse fate.  So often now networks, especially Fox, throw in the towel on a series before it has any time to grow.  At least SAAB got a full season and some sort of closure.  In fact, the open ending lends even more credibility to a series that was about war and its human toll.

That being said, boy, this series did not age well, at least for me.  Watching these episodes now, some of them are very poorly written and high on the cheese factor.  However the Chig Red Baron arc as well as that last Roundhammer arc are still very exciting and emotional.  The price of the set was worth it to me just for those last few episodes if nothing else.

As far as the problem being reported with disc 1, I have not had an issue.  I have a fairly new Toshiba player, but so far so good, so I have nothing to report on that front.

As far as extra features, I can't complain that there are none because 1) I didn't really expect there to be any and 2) I feel we're pretty lucky to get a DVD set at all even in this current trend of releasing whatever you have lying around the archives.  I'm just glad I can ditch my old VHS recordings.

Finally, and I hesitate to mention it because it is kind of stupid, but my solution to the double sided double disc slim case is just to slip a piece of mini-legal pad paper into the case to separate the two discs.  It is a perfect fit and cuts down on disc to disc friction when trying to get those stubborn cases open.

Other than that, these reviews are kind of amusing in their rhetoric.  If you liked the show buy it, you will suffocate holding your breath for a deluxe set.  If you don't like the show, don't buy it, spend the money on AA batteries or something.  (Everyone needs batteries right???)",1129507200,8,1881,4.149171270718232
2413150,1,B000BCCAEQ,"I purchased this set - twice.  And returned it - twice.

Seems there was a manufacturing defect in the production run, 2nd episode on disc one, side a, froze up a few minutes into the episode.  A close inspection of the disc revealed several small bubbles embedded in the plastic around the perimeter of the disc, causing read errors.  I figured this was a fluke, so returned it to the local retailer I purchased it from, and exchanged the set for another one.  Near the same spot, episode 2 on disc 1, it froze up again.  Looking at the disc showed the same problem as the first one.  Once again, I returned it to my local retailer, but insisted on a refund this time.

I MIGHT purchase this series again in the future (Maybe in a year or two), if the manufacturer can work out their problems, but would recommend that anyone thinking about purchasing this series wait a while until the defective production run is recalled.

  The first episodes build the characters, so that when the final episodes come around you are incredibly hooked, and attached to the fate of these humans engaged in intergalactic battle. This is essentually a tale much alike starship troopers, but with a nod to history, and the bravery of the marines, and my favourite episode, sugar dirt, dedicated to the marines who fought in Iwo Jima really amazed me, and showed me that these series is one of the best ever sci-fi productions ever made.

  Even though it was fairly shortlived, the last episodes will still unstill a sense of closure, and you will be left completelly satisfied. If you are at all interested in military and science fiction , this is a must for you.",1129248000,4,1122,4.585
2413152,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Space: Above and Beyond was a fantastic show that came before its time.  Unfortunately, the show, its producers and fans were treated poorly while it was on TV.  (For example, its time was shuffled around a lot, so I actually missed a lot of episodes.  It was supposed to have a second season, but its plug was pulled rather suddenly.)

But, finally, it is on DVD, about ten years later. I HIGHLY recommend it. Here's some basic stuff about the show and DVD:

1) About the show:  It's a war drama set in space, focusing on a Marine squadron, and the war is chiefly against a newly discovered alien race.  The storytelling and subplots are excellent, infused with wonderful subtleties like shadowy government conspiracies, character-development and character-driven story lines, WWII allusions and allegories, and poetry.  Serious themes like sacrifice, predestination, loyalty, racism and what it means to be human are explored, and yes, it's also defintely got witty and situational humor as well as plenty of plot twists and surprises.  Of course, there is also a lot of action, i.e. fight scenes in space, combat scenes.

To sum it up, this show makes you think, has excellent acting and stories, great action, good effects, and good music.  It paints a sad picture of war but still maintains that there is hope.

2)  About the DVDs:  They're bare-bones, so again, this show is not being treated with respect.  There are no special commentaries, but I knew that before buying the set.  The quality and sound are FAR better than any VCR copy I've seen and heard.  The original music is intact as far as I can tell, including important songs by Patsy Cline, Johnny Cash, and the Ramones (there was a rumor that certain music licenses could not be bought).  There are some Babylon 5 graphics on the menu screen, which I don't understand, because I don't think FOX owns that.

For forty bucks, it's still a good deal even without commentaries.  The show is like several good movies, whereas you can only buy a 2-3 normal movies for the same amount of money.

I am just happy S:AAB is out on DVD!  You should buy it!

And if the DVD sales go well, perhaps the show can be resurrected.  Even if that does not happen, this will prove that the show deserves more respect.  Then perhaps we can even get a commentary bonus DVD in the future, who knows?",1129075200,6,2345,4.67481662591687
2413153,3,B000BCCAEQ,"Created by X-Files collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong, Space: Above and Beyond was one of countless sci-fi series' (Strange Luck, Milennium, Harsh Realm, etc.) that were created as a companion to the megahit X-Files, and like those aforementioned shows, it only lasted a season before getting the axe (although Milennium lasted a full 3 before Fox gave up on it).  The series begins with Earth colonizing other planets, and soon finding themselves in an interstellar war with a mysterious alien race.  The show mainly focuses on a group of soldiers, all of whom have their various back stories (one is searching for his missing lover, another was created in a lab) that make for some interesting arcs.  The series has it's share of faults, chief among them are the choppy special effects and some wooden acting, but the realm of potential was unbelievably high for what might have been had Fox put more faith in it.  The series reaches it's highpoint in mid-season, and the final episode is amazingly poignant, but who knows what might have been.  All in all, Space: Above and Beyond isn't anything too special upon first viewing, but it's hard not to appreciate the imagination and heart that Morgan, Wong, and co. put into it.  Fox also dropped the ball with the DVD release as well, there's no extras to be found, and at least a commentary or interviews with Morgan and Wong would have been more than welcome here.",1128988800,104,1423,4.7877551020408164
2413154,5,B000BCCAEQ,"I loved this show when it was on TV.  It was probably my favorite program of it's time.  My rating of 5 stars reflects the show itself, not the quality of the DVDs.  I have gone through 3 box sets, trying to find one without problems.  That is really unacceptable.  I think Fox could've done much better, knowing how much devoted fans were waiting for this.  I tend to wonder if any restoration and quality control efforts were made at all.

Having said all that, this is still a wonderful slice of sci-fi fun and nostalgia from not too long ago.  The thing that impressed me the most was probably the feel of realism.  This seemed like a future that could be possible.  It was never too fantastic, never absurd, just good.",1128902400,,723,4.409090909090909
2413155,2,B000BCCAEQ,"Sure, if I don't like the packaging I can buy my own DVD holders, but why should I have to anyway?

I could get over the double-sided two disc per sleeve packaging that makes damage almost inevitable unless you handle them like you were doing brain surgery, but I'm having playback problems too.  I've skipped one episode completely because it froze in the first few minutes and I couldn't get past that part of the episode, and now there's a disc where one side causes my player to freeze completely between the FOX screen and the main menu.  I had to unplug my DVD player and plug it back in just to get it to function again.

So, my advice is to wait a year or so and see if they can get the bugs out of the pressing of this set.  And, they're going to have to re-work it anyway to get the Babylon-5 space station off all the title menus.  Har har!!

Too bad because it's a fun show.

Postscript:  I retract what I wrote about playback problems.  I was playing the DVDs on a cheap, awful DVD player which I have since gotten rid of.  When I tried the discs on my other DVD players they played fine.

2413156,5,B000BCCAEQ,"First off, let me say in my opinion, this is still one of the best TV shows ever.  The writing and stories still hold up and are top notch.  The effects 10 years later look a little dated, but they still work.  I would love to know what would have happened if Morgan and Wong were given the chance to further develop the stories they layed out.

If you like the new Battlestar Galactica then you'll appreciate how good this show was and could have been.  You only have to look at the success of the new BSG to realize that if this show was given the chance it deserved, it would have been huge. I hope somewhere Fox executive's are kicking themselves for not giving this show the support it deserved.  When quality programs like this are canceled it's no wonder why Fox continues to be a lame 2nd rate (make that 4th rate) network.  Get a clue guys!

To add insult to injury, Fox has done the lamest DVD ever.  The cheap two sided discs and the lack of any is just pitiful.

It annoys me that the discs are akin to The West Wing - both sides are uncovered (increasing the chance of scratching in a DVD case).

Additionally, there's no commentaries, no nothing. It's a pretty bland boxset.

THAT SAID:

Out of all the TV shows I've watched, this is one of the best. The CGI was pretty crap on the first three episodes (most notably, the pilot episodes); and when you see it, it'll remind you of Star Wars.

But the ensemble has great chemistry, and if you're a fan of action (a la Firefly, Saving Private Ryan, etc)... S:AAB is for you. The show had a cult status, and I must admit, I'd been waiting for a long time for this release. I didn't think I'd ever have it see the light of day.

2413158,5,B000BCCAEQ,I just wish there was some commentary from the cast. I keep wishing for more and still get upset that it was cancelled even though the ratings were good and received Emmy nominations.,1128124800,2,183,4.575757575757576
2413159,5,B000BCCAEQ,"The show is as excellent as I remember. It's like Aliens: the TV series done right and I highly recommend it. The performances are great, the leads likable, and the effects stack up even now.

If you purchase this title and the first disc is bad, Fox is going to send us replacement discs when they can press them. Amazon policy forbids me from handing out the number, but if you call Fox and tell them the specifics, they will take care of it.",1128038400,3,444,4.285714285714286
2413160,4,B000BCCAEQ,"Epsoide 2 seems to have 14 minutes of broken footage.

Seems to be on every Box Set. Must have been a production error.",1127952000,6,119,4.173913043478261
2413161,5,B000BCCAEQ,"Space: Above and Beyond is by far one of the best shows I have been priviledged enough to see. I caught it on it's first run back in 1995 and have waited for what seems like forever for this day to come.

It is pure brilliance on the part of creators/writers Glen Morgan and James Wong. An assembly of actors who give an outstanding performance in portraying a space Marine squadron, the 58th, a true band of brothers. Great character development, writing, acting. I can hardly think of one bad thing about this show except that the 3d graphics are now outdated.  But that's really a minor detail that hardly takes from the story and feel of the show.

I think the best part of the show is that even though it is set against a Sci-fi backdrop there is really a lot of exploration in to human nature. And it's written and acted beautifully so that you actually believe in these characters. If you like the new Battlestar Galactica then you will love this show.

And even if you didn't like the new BSG you will love this show. Because there is less of the beating around the bush...they are grunts, there's a war on, and stuff gets done.  Think Starship Troopers meets Battlestar Galactica meets Band of Brothers.  Trust me you won't be disappointed by this show.",1127952000,5,1262,4.489082969432315
2413162,4,B000BCCAEQ,"SPACE ABOVE AND BEYOND is a great example of good scifi.

A bunch of marines thrown together to battle a nearly unstoppable enemy (very much like STARSHIP TROOPERS, a film that came out MUCH later).

RANT:

Unfortunatly, television programs with character development, complex stories, and excellent production design are not understood by television executives... anything more complex than BAYWATCH and they don't get it and they start fiddling with it.

When the ratings get low from all the constant changes, they kill the series because of low ratings! The BABYLON5 spinoff CRUSADE was a victim of similar fiddling, and there are MANY other examples... Grrr..

DVD Set:

As with THE PRETENDER, FOX seems to put very little or nothing in the way of extras on their DVD sets... but as with THE PRETENDER I was so happy to see it out on DVD, I don't really care much about extras...

... I just have one question: What's the deal with the BABYLON5 station in the background on the DVD? Like scifi watchers aren't going to notice! Warner Bros. is going to get irratated!",1127865600,3,1071,4.819672131147541
2413163,4,B000BCCAEQ,"I'm appalled by what I read about the treatment this show got going onto DVD. This is yet another good show that Fox themselves ruined; X-FILES actually got people to watch their network, and indicated what kind of shows people would like to see on it... and these morons bounced the timeslots around and didn't give the shows the same time to develop that they gave to X-Files, which was not the smoothest show when it first aired.

They did this to SPACE, VR5, my personal favorite STRANGE LUCK, HARSH REALM, and countless others. SPACE's fate is particularly sad because of the amazing work by Kristen Kloke whom I've never seen since, outside of X-Files spin-off shows.

Also deserving of mention is the single best performance I've ever seen by a porn actress branching out into mainstream work; Ashlyn Gere, billed on TV as Kimberly Ashlyn Gere, does very good work in two episodes as an alien. She was also in an X-FILES ep and yes, she's hot, too.

This series always had good surprises in the writing, and it made you feel you were watching stars in the making. I want to see all the eps, which I never did... BUT IF THE STUPID DVD PACKAGERS ARE READING THIS, YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT I'LL CAMP OUT OVERNIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SCI-FI CHANNEL WITH A VCR AND BLANK TAPES FOR SIX YEARS!!!... RATHER THAN BUY THIS FINE SERIES IN THE MAIMED AND CARELESSLY PACKAGED CONDITION DESCRIBED IN THE OTHER REVIEWS. SURE, IT WASN'T A HIT, SO WE DON'T GET EXTRAS... BUT HOW ABOUT GIVING US DISCS THAT ACTUALLY WORK, MORONS????!!!!!",1127779200,4,1521,4.584558823529412

GREAT STORIES / Good ACTING / Great effects ( it's 10 years old ) I watched it avery chance i got. but it was HARD to find. I remember one time a NEW EPISODE was shown at 10:00 p.m on a wednesday I beleive it was. So if you never heard of it. i am not suprised. I thought that FOX HAD HATED THERE OWN SHOW!!!! . sadley it was cancelled ( suprising ??? ) FOX seems to let people work hard on shows only to abandon them even before they air ( see:firefly ) The Quality could be better. but at least it's here!!",1127520000,3,663,3.8043478260869565
