2546158,3,B000EXZFOE,"Joseph Graham both wrote and directed the first of the two short films on this DVD.  He has some interesting ideas both textually and visually and manages to condense into 47 minutes a film that packs a wallop.

'VANILLA' is anything but vanilla, if the term refers to the dichotomies between vanilla and kinky in the usual sense.  A young lad Jeff (Ryan A. Allen) is a highschool photographer who happens upon the kneeling suicide victim body of a beefy serial killer in the Bay Area. Questioned by the police and his father, he becomes obsessed with the string of murders linked to sexual encounters with young men, and his curiosity contributes to an art project as well as his own drive to experience how the murders took place.  Just how far his curiosity leads him is the fairly dramatic conclusion to this short film. The acting is pretty 'basic' cum weak, and the acting out of the trysts is heavy, but Graham does use his story as a romance with the camera: the film is appropriately shot in both black and white and color with the uses of each more important than they first appear.

'A LITTLE COMFORT' ('Just un pea de recon fort...') is a brief 36 minute French film by director Armand Lamellose that employs better actors and better cinematography, and actually a better story.  Arnaud (Arthur Moncla) is a young teenager coping with his attraction to the popular hunk Guillaume (Remi Bresson) who has a steady girlfriend. Arnaud imitates his idol trying cigarettes, alcohol and sex, finds a girlfriend, but when both girls leave their beaus, Guillaume (whose mother is dying and who has no family) seeks refuge with Arnaud, whose mother is more than happy to have Arnaud's 'best friend' stay with them rather than in a foster home.  At last, in the comfort zone, away from the outside world, Arnaud and Guillaume bond, fall in love, and actually fit into the society that they feared would ostracize them.  OR is this little tale merely the acting out of a dream for the tender little Arnaud....it is up to the audience to decide.

Films such as these, though each feel like works in progress, at least serve the intelligence of the film audience well.  It has not been very long since such films would have never made it to the shelves  of Amazon.com or the video stores.  The success of 'Brokeback Mountain' has opened a lot of windows, and for that we should be grateful. Now let's see the polished films of similar content that languish in the darker interstices.

8115703,3,B000EXZFOE,"I wouldnt say that Vanilla is the worst gay film Ive seen last years, but it isn't far from it. The problem stays mainly with the actual filming of the flick. With a great story in hand, the producing and directing resulted very poor, barely touching the thriller it could have been, The plot revolves around a man with homicide potential. Starting by killing an almost willing victim, for which he seemed deeply concerned, he evolves into a frenzy of killing people by hands while making sex. This is poorly developed, until he himself commits suicide. There comes the second part of the story, where the dead maniac is spotted by a sightseeing person, who becomes obsessed  with the murdered and the maniac himself. This tale could have been absorbing, but its just boring. The poor film making spoils all, not helped by bad acting. To avoid
The medium length is joined by another  -  A Little comfort to whom it bears no resemblance at all. This is a small French film dealing with the luring a guy has for another, who presently has a girlfriend. Its about the tortures of love not well corresponded, which leads little Arnaud to doing things we don't whether are good or not for him, like smoking, finding a girlfriendAll for the love of Guillaume, whom we have seen in the opening scenes of the film, is easily attired to girls. But the story has some changes and Guillaume, to avoid going to a foster house, finishes by living in Arnauds house. There, hell give him a little comfort which we never know for sure if its a retribution for living with him. Near the end, hopes again flame on Arnaud, in the person of a bright charming chevalier on this bright bicycle, when he finds Arnaud in a camp where he was supposed to be with Guillaume, who left he alone there. Maybe a new chance on love for Arnaud?
The film is very tender, and deserves a 5 for the feelings it aroused on me.",1452470400,,1888,4.498542274052478

8115707,5,B000EXZFOE,"I do believe that you would have had to have seen this movie for the first time on a big movie screen to really embrace the imagery of Vanilla. AND the message.  It is something that you have to see again and again to truly understand how much Joseph wants you to wonder about.

Being that I was a silent character who only had the opportunity to work ONE day on the set of the film, and my scenes are imagery based and I was the GOGODANCER, I can say that there was a lot more going on in this film than I even knew until I actually was allowed to view the final piece for the opening night in San Francisco.

I never read the script for I was directed to conduct my own choreography for my role, since at the time I had been gogodancing in San Francisco for real.  BUT to see what the finished product was compared to the 12 hours on set, I was blown away.

There is many aspects to filming and a film that one cannot truly discuss about Vanilla if compared to the other indie film it was paired with for DVD.  It's unfair to even try.

AND out of fairness to the film that I participated in, and upon acquiring my own copy of this film, I HAVE never seen the other film 'A Little Comfort' and I have no desire to.  It brings me no interest, despite if it has good reviews or not.  I don't think this movie should have be lumped in with Vanilla.  TLA should have just given Joseph Graham his own packaging, and the other one as well.

Neither of these films had anything to do with one another.  It's a shame too, because Joseph Graham is an EXTREMELY talented gay director.",1287705600,,1576,4.11437908496732

8115709,4,B000EXZFOE,"I had to watch VANILLA a couple times before I ""got"" it, but it was worth it. This movie is imaginative, provocative, disturbing and beautiful -- though not for everyone. If you like David Lynch or the writers Dennis Cooper or Jean Genet, you might like this movie. I was impressed by how ambitious it was, thematically and visually, and how sensuous and surprizingly emotional it was. The ending made little sense logically (like  a dream) but it made perfect sense emotionally. And although some of the acting was crude, the scene where the boy loses his virginity -- both in the real world and then in his dream world -- was a tour-de-force of vulnerability, honesty, courage and truth. While I found the French movie vague and predictable, i have to applaude the makers of Vanilla for taking risks and telling their strange, daring, story in original ways. I look forward to more work from these filmmakers.",1174694400,9,911,4.765822784810126
8115710,3,B000EXZFOE,"I totally know why there are two movies here... the first, Vanilla, is one of the worst movies in history.  It's painfully bad.  The acting is horrible, the special effects are laugh out loud funny, and the men themselves are not attractive at all.  The movie is sorta like The Grudge gay style with a dash of...well...stupidity.  The story is about a boy that is a virgin that finds the dead corpse of a gay killer.  After he finds the body he starts seeing ghosts everywhere that basically do nothing.  The murderer comes back to life for some reason and magic stuff starts happening that makes no sense.  I actually think the writers were on drugs while making this.  The ending is one of the worst endings in movie history. (if this can even be called a movie).

A Little Comfort on the other hand is actually good.  The acting is solid and the writing is strong.  It seems to be an honest account of what life is like for a young gay boy living around straight people.  The ending is extremely weak and changes the movie from a personal account to a fairy tale.  Besides the silly ending the movie is good especially for a short film.",1164672000,6,1139,4.418269230769231

(FIVE STARS for ""......Comfort""  /  TWO STARS for ""Vanilla"")

Don't waste your time on the ""Vanilla"" portion of this DVD.......unless you're into the weird and surreal.  The director presumably is projecting a ""message"" in this work, but this viewer is not at all sure it's worth discovering. (2-Stars awarded for filming technique and not-the-world's-worst acting levels).

On the other hand, for all you romantics out there, take comfort in the great little second feature on this disc.  It's one that can make us all feel young again (oh, gosh, do we really want that?).

Poor little Arnaud, he's a real sweetie.  He pretty much knows, sexually, who he is and what he wants, but it's the desire for the who-he-wants that's giving him problems.  And, unfortunately for his peace of mind, the ""hotness"" of that desire manifests itself.....even during sleep (though Mom is very sympathetic at a time like that, does she actually realize the problem's cause........hmm, perhaps more than we know).

Arnaud, of course, must make one of life's first mistakes, one which so many of us make:  choosing the wrong object of desire, the wrong person to fixate on.  And, here, this reviewer's interpretation of Guillaume's role in Arnaud's life is at polar opposites from the opinion expressed by another viewer/writer on this site.  In my eyes, G. is the epitomy of the ""mixed-up kid"" (and, perhaps with good reason, considering his family/home situation).  He's a tease, concerned primarily with his own gratification, and, in the end, is someone who can relate to our sweet little hero only if pretense is involved (the nature of that pretense you'll easily discover with your own eyes.....er.....uh.....I mean, ears).

In concluding this little reflection of mine on teen life (a life-period which often needs more than the title's little comfort), let me say we can only hope that the angel of a cyclist who appears at film's end is there to provide much more than just 'a little comfort' to our Arnaud.  He deserves it.

PS--Pulling us right into the scenes with him, Arthur Moncla does a great job with his character of Arnaud.......especially considering he was only about 17 at the time (yeah, more like 17 going on 40).
