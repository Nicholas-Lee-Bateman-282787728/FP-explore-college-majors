I watched a funny edited video on a popular video website comprised of clips from this film, and so I became curious and decided to purchase it myself on the cheap a few years ago, mostly for kitschy purposes, and just to have a copy of it. It's pretty bizarre, with crazy, nonconforming animation. The plot is out there, and I can't help but wonder if the animators were under the influence of something. The same voice talent that voiced Chucky from Rugrats voices the title character, David, but I didn't even know that until I looked it up because everything in this movie was so trippy and distracting that I could not tell.

It's definitely not in the same league with Disney films of the same vintage, but I get a great laugh every time I watch this thing. Again, bizarre!",1318032000,,834,4.450980392156863
