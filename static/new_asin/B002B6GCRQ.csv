The plot is the life of Mei LangFang between the end of the Heavenly Empire, the years of the Republic of China, the Japanese invasion, and, the first years of the Communist regime.
But, more than that, it is the story of people that have helped, influenced and shaped his life and acting in the Beijing Opera. The layer that became his protector, the relentless wife, the graceful Xiaodong, all plot around LangFang, and bring to him facial expression and feelings that his role would not have otherwise had.
