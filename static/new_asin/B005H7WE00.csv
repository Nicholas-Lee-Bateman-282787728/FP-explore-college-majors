8472742,2,B005H7WE00,"All in all, this is a rather disappointing film. In the 1830s Franz Liszt initiated a passionate affair with Marie d'Agoult, a married woman, who eventually bore him three children. During the first flame of their romance they traveled extensively, exploring together the beauties of nature in Switzerland and the beauties of art and literature in Italy. The most notable result was two wonderful suites for piano, the ""Annes de plrinage"" (Years of Pilgrimage), Books I and II. The title of the film implies that it is a study of this fascinating period in Liszt's life, but it is not. The Liszt/d'Agoult affair is discussed in some detail, though it emphasizes only the Italian segment of their ""pilgrimage""; the Swiss segment is scarcely mentioned. On the upside, there are some interesting excerpts from letters, diaries, and memoirs; on the downside, we see much pantomime by two actors who purport to represent the lovers, and who bear no resemblance to either. The rest of the film consists of a superficial overview of Liszt's entire career, with several Italian critics and scholars offering commentary that is mostly obvious and sometimes inaccurate. There are some more perceptive and interesting comments by musicians, notably Charles Rosen, Leslie Howard (oddly, speaking Italian), and Antonio Pappano (speaking perfect English). The music heard is entirely brief excerpts. So the film is not entirely bad, but it could have been much better if, as the title suggests, it had concentrated on Franz and Marie's complicated relationship and/or the marvelous music that came out of it. Perhaps worth seeing once.",1317168000,5,1621,5.21455938697318
