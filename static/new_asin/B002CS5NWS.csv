3907014,5,B002CS5NWS,"If you want a laugh out loud, laugh your butt off, and a most laughable time......get this video!!!  You will enjoy it!",1358553600,,119,4.409090909090909
3907015,5,B002CS5NWS,"I have listened to these jokes many times on YouTube and wanted to have these videos in a more permanent form so that I could watch them at my leisure or when I am away from the computer.  Funny, funny stuff!",1338508800,,208,4.073170731707317
3907016,4,B002CS5NWS,"Many of these appeared on youtube but having them all on DVD is convenient.  The format is to have seemingly ordinary people tell their favorite jokes -- generally the sort of joke that has ""Jewish humor,"" such as explained by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin in his book ""Jewish Humor.""  By the way, I highly recommend that book as well.

One can see that most of these folks are not professionals.  You can tell when the scene has been reshot and different takes are combined to be smoother.  But the jokes are funny and the whole concept is delightful.  Some of them are familiar, others were new to me, and a few had me laughing so hard I had to press the pause button.

For those who enjoy this sort of humor I recommend it.  But it is an acquired taste.

Try it -- you'll like it.",1319500800,2,776,4.296551724137931
3907017,1,B002CS5NWS,"I was very disappointed with this video.  I purchased it to use as part of a comedy program I was planning for a group I am chairperson of, but after reviewing it with a committee of 6 members, it was decided not to use it.  We didn't think the jokes were particularly funny, and the delivery of some of them was too fast.  All if all, this wasn't worth watching.",1299456000,,363,4.1571428571428575
3907018,4,B002CS5NWS,If you are the type of person who can't wait for a family gathering just so you can hear the funny uncle tell jokes that make your eyes roll...this dvd is for you.  Makes a good gift for alta kochers (if they can figure out how to use their dvd player).,1291248000,,253,3.9607843137254903
3907019,2,B002CS5NWS,"I bought this DVD and was disappointed because it is just not that funny. It is like watching a retirement home talent show. The jokes are ones we have heard before,nothing new.",1258502400,3,177,4.5625
3907020,5,B002CS5NWS,So there I was at home...working as usual...not in a particularly good mood. I take a break turning on my AppleTV and discover this podcast with an amusing title.  I play one of the jokes (can't remember which one) and just break out laughing out loud till tears came out! They're not all quite that good but most are hilarious...ever since they never fail to make me laugh or at least get me into a much better mood.,1256860800,5,417,4.346153846153846
3907021,5,B002CS5NWS,"It's exactly what you think it is: Funny, stale, risqu (and not-so-funny and hot so stale and not so risqu) jokes, backed with Klezmer music, told by elderly men and women of the Jewish faith. What makes these 55 minutes so fascinating is that the joke tellers are not pros, but rather doctors, lawyers, salespeople-you know, just like your Uncle Mort and Aunt Fannie. Some of the jokers have such mesmerizing mannerisms and bouncy styles that they could go onto show-biz careers. But, hey, a deigeh hob ich?

3907022,5,B002CS5NWS,"If ever there was a film (though this is really a digitally shot video) whose title told it like it is, this is it.  For 44 minutes you watch, and hear, 16 men and two women - all Jewish and ""moderately"" old - telling jokes. Some tell a couple so there are 38 jokes in all. The only issue is whether the storytellers are ""old"". ""Old is a relative term and most of the participants - each of who stands before an unseen small (based on the laughter) audience while a white curtain acts as scenery. Most are between 65 and 70 years old with the eldest being 75.

Think of this as ""Comedy Night at your local synagogue"". None are professionals but they have a good deadpan delivery. Some of the jokes hit you about 10 seconds after you hear the drum thud at the end. And many are REALLY funny. A few of the storytellers (there are short funny stories as well as one-two jokes) cover other ethnicities (Italians, for one) but most are the Jews laughing at themselves. There are quite a few ""risqu"" ones and private parts are often described so don't play this in front of your young kids. (They probably wouldn't get the joke anyway).

There are no real Special Features. There is a ""find a joke"" option - which is just the Chapter index and a ""hear a new joke"" option, which just displays a web site where you can hear more.

It is a lot of fun and makes a great gift for that parent or relative for a birthday or holiday. Giving the gift of laughter is a blessing and there's enough fun here to entertain the viewer for 44 minutes.

8364372,2,B002CS5NWS,"I got this as a present for my mother, then watched it with her. It's 40 minutes long and has 39 jokes, 28 of which are about sex, foul language, or farting. I counted.

Considering the simplicity of the production, they could've made this a lot longer for the price. But it probably would've just been more fart jokes.

There is a long tradition of great Jewish humor. This isn't in it.",1420675200,3,387,4.361111111111111

8364377,1,B002CS5NWS,"Maybe the first 10 minutes were ok, but after that it became a snoozefest.  The DVD was a parade of people standing up presenting a single joke and then going on to the next person.  The lighting was flat.  there was no attempt for any stage interest -- flat lighting, no makeup, no changed camera angles, nothing.",1395100800,,314,4.473684210526316
8364378,3,B002CS5NWS,"These are ordinary people (mostly retired persons) doing stand-up joke delivery. They tell one joke at at time, and editor switches between joke tellers between every joke.

About half the jokes were good clean fun; the other half are a brand of graphic, raunchy, pornographic jokes that I would be ashamed for my parents or grandparents to tell.",1392249600,,346,4.9655172413793105
