The originals are both black & white, the quality of picture is as you would expect with most old movies, not very good.  This remake is in color & 'CINEMASCOPE'  (very WIDE  screen).  The story line is the same but a far better interpretation of it, it stars Angela Lansbury, Cybil Shepherd, Elliot Gould & Herbert Lom & is set in Germany just before the outbreak of World War 11.  The inferior originals of both of these movies are available in Region 1 but unfortunately the far superior remakes of both of the movies I mention here are only available on DVD in Region 2 !",1387756800,,805,4.398648648648648
