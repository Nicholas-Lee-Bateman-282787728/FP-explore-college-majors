8585113,5,B00CQRNM7I,"I'm confused on this set. I would like to also purchase this set among us other 10 million people out there who love Alfred Hitchock, but I'm too in the USA, where now syndication on these shows are rarely showed, and/or unable to see without sattalite. I'm not clear about the type of player needed to watch this set, which means? I pay for a whole new DVD player, just to watch these shows? Did they riganate this on purpose so most Americans have a difficult time purchasing these? I agree with the others comments on why is this set so difficult for a ready sell, without all this confusion in the process?? Where are you Alfred to solve this case??? I will wait for response before purchasing, sad American missing out on my favorite shows with my favorite actors.--",1521244800,,771,4.514285714285714

8585119,1,B00CQRNM7I,"I don't own this Hitchcock dvd. I have a region 1 dvd/blu-ray player. I would very much like to own this Hitchcock dvd and all other Hitchcock dvd's not released for region 1. Maybe this is a copyright thing, as region 1 has a huge market. Can anyone enlighten us region 1 viewers currently orbiting a seemingly restricted Hitchcock universe as to why they are not being released in region1?",1468886400,11,391,4.6
