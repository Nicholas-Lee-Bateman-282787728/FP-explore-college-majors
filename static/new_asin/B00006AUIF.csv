7966553,5,B00006AUIF,I have been listening to the Mississippi Choir for a long time. I have enjoyed listening and watching them on DVD. The Amazing Love DVD is filled with all of the great songs you hear on the CD. I have enjoyed watching this DVD. My favorite song on the DVD is Holding On and I Won't Let Go! The Mississippi Mass Choir keeps singing and uplifting Jesus in these songs!,1252713600,,366,4.242857142857143
