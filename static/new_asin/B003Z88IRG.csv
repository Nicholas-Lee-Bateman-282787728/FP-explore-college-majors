8409974,1,B003Z88IRG,"This bio is awful!!! It's way rushed. It leaves out so much about who David Letterman is. I miss the bios of yesteryear. They used to take there time to tell who the person is or was. I was hoping it was the other bio that came out about ten years ago. If anyone wants to know what the old bios of years past was like,watch the bio on Marilyn Monroe from 96. That was a great bio.",1412899200,4,380,3.8846153846153846
