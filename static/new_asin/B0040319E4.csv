4237698,5,B0040319E4,"Comic Party Revolution is NOT ""Comic Party the Sequel"", Comic Party Part two"", or ""Comic Party Continued"". But apparently that's what frustrated some people.
It is a revolving series of stories involving the original cast.  Frankly I find it entertaining.  In fact I feel that the original Comic Party series had some major flaws.  The story line involving Mizuki was frustrating because it was so one sided and the series ended at the beginning.  Everything had been leading up to the Comic Party-and stopped.  What's up with that?

I personally love the stories.  The baseball story was funny and the ""Please Listen to my feelings"" story was poignant.

I can see why some people are disappointed.  The acting IS more frantic and more clichs are used.  So what?  This series is different, that's all.",1342137600,5,801,4.902985074626866
4237699,3,B0040319E4,"I was very happy to see Comic Party Revolution released as one of Funamation's S.A.V.E. titles because I'd enjoyed the original Comic Party quite a bit and was looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with Kazuki, Taishi, Mizuki, and the rest of the gang of doujinshi creators, cosplayers, and the like.  I could scarcely have been more disappointed when I got to view this sequel.  In the original, there is a definite story, wherein the manic Taishi introduces then coerces his friend Kazuki to the heady world of doujinshi or ametur fan comics, so much a part of popular Japanese culture.  This is much to the displeasure of Kazuki's longtime would-be girlfriend Mizuki, who slowly learns to first accept and then appreciate the positive influence the creative process has on the object of her affections.  The first season ends with Kauzki's high school graduation and intent to pursue his newfound artistic muse.

Unfortunately, Revolution chooses to largely ignore the established premise in favor of making it just another typical ""harem"" comedy with the main character surrounded by an even greater number of available and admiring females.  In addition to those already introduced, there are several expanded into romantic possibilities and at least one, Subaru, that appears totally without introduction, apparantly ""borrowed"" from the manga this is based on.  Oddly, the fiercely competetive manga-writing duo of Yuu and Eimi are somewhat reversed in importance in this version with the green-haired Eimi recieving the most attention.  Character designs are similar to the first, but somehow seem more angular and less original or interesting.  The English-speaking voice actors are all different from the original; naturally the Japanese cast remains the same, with veteran Masami Kikuchi as Kazuki. ( He has plenty of experience with roles such as this, being the voice of Tenchi in that long-running series! )

Most irritating is the abandonment of any real storyline for what essentially is a set of thirteen stand-alone ""filler"" episodes that do almost nothing to develop the too-many characters, becoming merely an excuse to trot out the staple anime situations: the ""haunted"" school, tennis and baseball matches, trips to the beach and mountains, etc. etc.  It's in only a few disjointed episodes that we return to the basic premise of the series: the writing and marketing of manga, both doujinshi and professional.  The only saving grace is to be found in these few episodes, particularly the penultimate one where Kauzki and his quiet friend Aya, and cosplayer Reika and Mizuki pair up to tour respectively aspects of creating and marketing professional comics.  This all-too-brief return is all that saves Revolution from its otherwise total immersion in boredom.",1306454400,5,2788,5.280542986425339
4237700,3,B0040319E4,"Not the worst anime comedy I've seen, but certainly not the best. The whole series just feels like it's desparate to get a laugh out of the viewer, and even the good jokes get pushed too hard. What might have been a belly laugh if the writers had used a little subtlety gets reduced to a polite chuckle by their strained efforts. Voice acting is as over-done as the writing no matter which side of the pond you're into. The animation is decent and the characters designs are passable, but nothing amazing here in the visuals department. I'm glad I got what was already a S.A.V.E. title on sale, otherwise I would've felt like I over paid.",1298505600,6,638,4.461538461538462
4237701,4,B0040319E4,A good follow up to the original story but having less to do with publishing comics and more on side adventures of the gang.,1274227200,2,124,4.208333333333333
4237702,3,B0040319E4,"I've become a bit renown (for better or worse) for picking up established anime franchises late then backtracking to the beginning in effort to make sense out of the ending (which I started with).  Enter Comic Party Revolution - The Complete Series from Funimation.  The whole ""Revolution"" part of the name should have clued me in to the fact that this was a sequel to a series aptly named ""Comic Party"".  The good news is that watching the original Comic Party isn't a requisite to enjoying Revolution, but it certainly enhances the experience.  But before I get into all that, let's take a look at the cold hard facts:

Released across two discs, Comic Party Revolution The Complete Series comes packaged in a standard DVD case and consists of episodes 1-13.  The show comes in at a total runtime of 325 minutes and wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to a few clothed butt shots, a little light swearing, and typical anime silliness.

Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub and original Japanese soundtrack (either in stereo) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.

Extras include textless opening and closing songs, and a host of fresh Funimation trailers on the second disc.

The story goes something like this: Kazuki, Mizuki and a few of their college pals aren't into just reading manga (comics), they actually self-published their own books (a process called doujinshi in Japan).  Kazuki, who's own book sells moderately well, ends up coming to enjoy spending time with Aya: a shy girl he meets at a manga convention (Comic Party) who hasn't been having any success with her own book.

Sure my summary overlooks many of the side plots and small tangents that viewers will be carried along on throughout the 13-episode run, the fact is that the show is far more character oriented than it is plot-driven.  In fact, while attempting to ""trim off the fat"" of the story to fit into a paragraph or two, I became aware of the fact that the show certainly prides itself on a lighthearted, offbeat and often humorous take on what could be an intriguing premise.  In other words, Comic Party Revolution makes it a habit of not taking itself too seriously and expects its viewers to do the same.

The self-published Japanese comic book industry is definitely the type of environment I just adore as a backdrop for the lead characters but, and sadly, it is little more than a minute background element here with romantic comedy, slapstick, and sheer goofiness taking the spotlight.  The episodes in which the grand plot (particularly the ones where the gang visits a magazine publishing office) are superbly done with just enough realism to spark the imagination of the viewer.  However, and more often than not, prepare to witness baseball games, tennis matches, paintball tournaments and other action-laden sequences that serve as little more than tangents to fill episodes.

The humor element is present (if at times forced) in either language option.  I was convinced at first that enjoying the production in the original Japanese dialog was the superior language option of the two but then discovered some of the charm only present in the English track (Yu's Brooklyn accent, the Arnold Schwarzenegger impression in the paintball episode, Eimi Ooba's near-constant mispronunciations and so on).  The Japanese cast delivers the material better but the English version is laced with humor that Americans will get.

In all Comic Party Revolution picks up with the cast and gags that made the first series so successful and fans of the original will find much to like in the sequel.  Those looking for increased plot development may be disappointed in the lack of evolution found here.  I personally found the series laced with interesting bits and potential plot threads that are unfortunately lost to the zaniness in the foreground (there's one whole episode devoted to Eimi's efforts to keep her summer school enrollment secret as per the advice of the talking fish she consorts with on her Sega Dreamcast so that she can live her dream of one day going to the beach).

I've been told to check out a series called Genshiken for a more serious stab at the same genre and just may do so considering the hints of promise that shine through in Comic Party Revolution.",1255996800,5,4320,4.855585831062671
8411708,5,B0040319E4,"This continuation uses some different voice actors from the original ""Comic Party"" but still faithful to the original characters.  If you liked the original, you'll like Revolution.
If you're unfamiliar with this series, it's about a guy who is prodded into producing and selling his own doujinshi or ""fan comics""and the people he is introduced to along the way, much to the chagrin of a unrequited love interest. This new story is animated similar to the older production original series and you will notice it in the artwork; if your the kind of viewer who has the propensity to critique every detail of your anime, you will find a lot wrong with with this show.  The story is pretty basic and easy to follow.  The characters range from the average filler to the obnoxiously outrageous with an English dub that follows in kind.  It's a fun occasional watch, not groundbreaking by any means, like having a pint between meals; just kick your feet up and watch something silly.  This is a good buy and a great addition to your anime collection.",1514419200,,1043,4.740331491712707
