1804547,5,B00007AJHU,"This second video in Rainbeau Mars 4 tape set ""Sacred Yoga"" is really wonderful!
 This tape has a beautiful sequence of poses that gently open your hips, shoulders and overall body. What is really great is that not only does it prepare your body for sitting meditation, but the entire tape is done like a meditation.
 Rainbeau leads you thru this practice at a gentle pace which lets you really move into the poses gradually and stay in them long enough to really melt into them and receive the most from them physically, mentally and spiritually.
 Her instructions are very easy to follow she has a wonderful relaxed and natural way of putting everything across.
  The scenery is beautiful and the music is a perfect compliment to it which helps create a really wonderful atmosphere to practice with.
 Highly recommended!
 Namaste.",1042588800,15,832,4.858156028368795

She takes you through slow and easy stretching with deep breathing and by the end of the exercise, you feel your body has been given well oxygenated blood to all muscles, which makes you feel more limber and tranquil.",1371513600,,315,4.833333333333333
1804549,5,B00007AJHU,I cant give a recommendation for anything more than this tape.  SHE IS THE BEST.  I own many many yoga tapes and this is the best beginner tapes there are.  I love her as a yoga instructor.  You will be please with anything she does.  Thank you Rainbeau Mars for your yoga tapes.

You can modify the practice to make it more challanging! The music, setting and her soothing voice make it SO fantastic!!! Rainbow Mars is very centered, calm and knows her stuff and you can tell she is truly committed to yoga!",1346716800,,369,4.211267605633803

1804552,5,B00007AJHU,i've only been practicing yoga for a few months.  i am amazed at how athletic AND calming this dvd is!  her instructions are extremely helpful!  Rainbeau's vision is enlightening!  very helpful in a physical way and mindfulness way!  i will definately keep my eye out for more of her!,1334016000,,284,4.714285714285714
1804553,5,B00007AJHU,"I used this everyday for a month November of 2010.  After about 2 weeks, I added Rodney Yee's Yoga Burn practice every other day immediately following this session and I went from doing 0 pull-ups to around 5.  In ONE MONTH'S TIME!  I've read that Yoga is really all you need for the body and I'm convinced that that's true.  After that month, I stopped because I never had time once I began my new job.  I lost all that I had gained but have recently started up again from scratch.  Once again using this DVD 5 days a week, and when I feel ready, incorporating Rodney's practices.

I love Rainbeau's approach to teaching.  It's light and easy going.  Being someone who had no strength at all (trembling core, thin arms) I found her exercises to be a good place to start where I wasn't hurting too bad but could still feel a burn.  Her voice is very soothing as well and it helps to really let me focus in on how I'm doing.  I also usually spend over 20 minutes meditating in Savasana at the end of her lesson for maximum integration.

If there are any cons to this DVD, I don't know of any from my experience.  She even teaches you alternatives to some poses if you can't do the original for whatever reason.  I've recommend this to a bunch of people and will continue to do so.  This is a great DVD and am eager to try her others in the series.",1317081600,2,1346,4.223529411764706
1804554,5,B00007AJHU,"Rainbeau is such an awesome instructor, so personable and knowledgable in her work. This is by far my most favourite workout dvd of her's. It's intense enough but quite easy to follow and it leaves me feeling taller and stretched and present afterwards every time. The setting is on the beach and so relaxing. Out of all her 4 'Pure' dvds this one is by far the best.",1311984000,,367,4.411764705882353
1804555,5,B00007AJHU,"I am a teenage girl who suffers from body dysmorphic disorder. When I bought this, I bought it for one purpose only: I was determined to loose weight.

My entire life, I have hated my body. My mom knew something was wrong when at nine years old, in Disney World, I refused to put on a bathing suit and go swimming with the rest of my family. A few doctors and therapists later, we knew the truth.

It has been hard living this way. My family are the only people that know, so I feel uncomfortable in lots of situations. Going to the beach with friends terrifies me. In my mind, they will see how grossly ugly I am and immediately hate me. My body probably is fine, but I can't see it. Instead, I've spent my life feeling trapped in this disgusting prison that is my body.

Anyway, back to the video (have I been rambling, sorry). I originally bought it to cure my fat ugliness once and for all. But, it did something entirely different for me.

You would think that looking at Rainbeau's amazingly perfect body, it would make me feel even uglier and fatter. Well, at first, it did. But I continued the video, with an open mind, and it was amazing.

No, the video isn't the incredibly challenging, intense workout that I was looking for. It's only like 30 minutes, and it causes me to merely break a light sweat. But I don't care about that anymore. Somehow, perhaps it was the breathing, or the calmness, or the poses, or Rainbeau's words, somehow, at the end of it, I felt beautiful.

After completing the video I looked down and my legs and smiled. This was shocking and amazing to me. I truly felt beautiful with my body exactly the way it was. The feeling is almost impossible to describe, I felt free and happy and just content with my body for the first time in a very, very long time.

No, its not a permanent fix to my disorder, the feeling doesn't last all day long (I did it on Monday, didn't do it on Tuesday, and then did it just now on Wednesday). But for me, this video is worth it.

I recommend buying this video. Not for just your body, but for your mind. It helped me with my biggest fear/problem in life, so maybe it can help other people. Just give it an honest, open try. You will not be disappointed.",1305676800,2,2221,4.284009546539379
1804556,1,B00007AJHU,"As I was looking everywhere on the box for the length of time on this DVD I found it odd that it doesn't indicate how long the workout is going to last. Then as I excitedly tried the workout since I enjoyed Rainbow Mars on The Exercise chanel on TV, I found out why. It is way too short, and too simple. I am one disappointed  Yogi. What a waist!!!",1298419200,,348,3.9714285714285715
1804557,5,B00007AJHU,"This is a true beginners yoga video. However, I have found that when I just need to slow down and enjoy an easy vinyasa practice this is what I grab off the shelf. My son (he is 11) has ADHD and is overweight. He enjoys this practice because it helps calm his mind and reduces stress in his body. The pose's and postures are done slow enough that he can keep up. I think it also helps that he has a crush on Rainbeau! Another great practice my son uses is pure tranquility by Rainbeau Mars. It is a practice to prepare you for meditation, you do the practice sitting down and laying down. That truly calms his mind and body. Thanks Rainbeau for all you have done.",1282694400,3,663,4.1875
1804559,4,B00007AJHU,I have a deteriorating disc in by lumbar region and I've found that yoga helps. This CD is great for building up to more difficult asanas.  I would reccommend this Cd to anyone trying to start getting back into shape.,1271289600,3,217,4.425
1804560,4,B00007AJHU,"That's what Rainbeau Mars reminds us throughout this inspirational and invigorating 35 minute workout. I enjoyed PURE SWEAT however it didn't actually make me sweat. It was however somewhat challenging especially in the lower body and hips and I wouldn't recommend this to beginners because of the difficulty level and lack of detailed instruction. A problem for me was that Rainbeau doesn't always tell you which leg to move foreword she just says ""other leg"" and I often forgot which leg I had already done. The length of this program was just right for me to be able to fit into my schedule and the windy Hawaiian beach, gorgeous. The entire practice has dubbed in cuing and Rainbeau does tend to talk a lot but I enjoyed her spiritual motivation.

15 minute gradually building Sun Salutations
15 minute Standing series
5 minute Savasana including cool down

Beginning in Chair pose Rainbeau leads us through 15 minutes of gradually building Sun Salutations (Down dog, Push up, Cobra) before putting them all together into a nice flow. We then start the 15 minute standing pose section which includes;  Warrior 2, Side Angle, a very difficult 3-legged dog pose (which is also done to the side) Standing prayer twists, ending in Childs pose, some brief stretching and a delicious 5 minute savasana. All the standing poses are interspaced with Vinyasas and I definitely felt this in my legs and hips.

1804562,5,B00007AJHU,"Ok- she is awesome. This is the best yoga video we have ever used in our practice. We love this instructor. She has superb guidance with a hippie feel in her words and a great personality. The poses are easy to do and most of  the 45 minutes is floor based- which i like since i get dizzy easily when doing yoga while standing up.

1804564,5,B00007AJHU,"I had originally started Yoga with Rainbeau Mars via an On Demand exercise program.  Fortunately, I was able to tape that segment because it was removed from the On Demand programing.  Since I had cut off the beginning of the session, all I remembered was that her name was Rainbow and I was obviously spelling it wrong.  Long story short and to the point;  I absolutely LOVED her form of yoga and wanted more of it.  Took me almost a year to find this and I'm so glad I did.  The Vinyasa Flow: Beginners is the extended version of what I had taped.  It is done at a nice slow and relaxing pace.  She gives you the time to embrace the breathing technique as well as the yoga positions.  Of course, if you are a beginner, you may still need pause, rewind, & replay the DVD a few times to make sure your in the proper position.  I still do it since I am not familiar with the extended portion on the DVD that was not included on the On Demand version I copied.  But once you get the positions, and they are not that hard, you will be able to ""flow"" through the session without even looking at the TV.  This is not for people looking for ""Power Yoga"" or other intense type versions of yoga.  This is for people who are looking for a yoga program to relax & calm them while offering some stretching, toning, & flexibility.  I am still working on getting through this DVD completely but, I already have her next one on my wish list.",1225065600,2,1427,4.217712177121771
1804565,4,B00007AJHU,"I've been doing Yoga for 3-4 months now so I'm definitely still a beginner.  I'm moderately fit but definitely have room to improve.  While there are many many poses I have yet to master, chaturanga being my current challenge, I did not find this video tape too difficult for an average beginner.  There are modifications given for most of the more difficult poses.

Yes, it is very challenging, particularly towards the end, but it's doable with some determination.  IMO, it's pretty much basic poses that focus on lower body strength.  There were two poses that were very challenging, the 3 legged down dog and one where you lift one leg to the side in a forward bend.  There's no way I looked like Rainbeau did on the DVD but I went at my own pace, lifted my leg as far as I could without losing form and accepted my current level of ability.

I really like Rainbeau Mars as an instructor she has the ability to talk a lot during the practice but it's not annoying chatter.  Instead she motivates you with the beautiful things she says.  The fact that she sometimes tells you what benefits you get from particular poses as you are in them is a big plus to me.

I did notice some dubing issues and usually I prefer a longer workout with more floor poses after a vigorous flowing sequence but the length of this video, @35 min, is perfect so that you can do a gentler more restorative practice afterwards if you want to.  As to the ""sweat"" part of the workout, I didn't really break a sweat until 20 minutes into it but once it started, it kept on comin'!!  I felt invigorated afterwards!

I'd say this is a nice challenging workout in which there is room for me to grow and improve my poses!  There are many reviews here that would scare off the average beginner, I almost didn't even try this, but I would encourage anyone with who is moderately fit and has some basic knowledge of poses to try it.  You might surprise yourself like I did!",1218585600,,1942,4.412921348314606
1804566,2,B00007AJHU,"Similar to ""Pure power"",too simple, too short and not really a flowing sequence . The cover here algo has NOTHING to do with the actual practice.

1804568,4,B00007AJHU,"Rainbeau Mars warm personality infuses this yoga practice with a subtle energy. The poses are perfect for beginners or relaxing for intermediates. As Rainbeau leads you through a flowing set of asanas the pleasant narrations is subtly calming. This is perfect for the end of the day when you want to nourish the body with breath. During the first 30 minutes you will be doing Cat/Cow, Downward Facing Dog, Child's Pose, Table, Moving Cat, Forward Bends, Low Lunges and Cobra. The session ends with a final relaxation pose or you can choose to do five additional poses shown from the front or side view.

1804569,5,B00007AJHU,"Rainbeau Mars invites you into a tranquil space where you can fully surrender into each yoga pose. Her escapes into pure focus demonstrate perfect techniques and she gives key pointers to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly with a sense of dedication. At times she starts talking about the movements slightly ahead of time, but this is OK because then you are well prepared for the next step. She has a beautiful spirit and never sinks into mediocrity. Each pose is perfected and performed like a work of art.

The relaxing beach setting and calming music are perfect for a less active form of yoga. The session begins and ends in a seated position. There is a focus on spine twists and forward bends. Throughout the entire workout you will find yourself developing patience and relaxing deeply into the poses. As you surrender to gravity, ocean waves crash on rocks. There is a balance between the ocean's energy and Rainbeau Mars inner tranquility. As you nourish the body with breath, you gain a sense of calm to face life's chaos.

1804570,4,B00007AJHU,"Many people wrote great reviews already. I want to add that Rainbeau has great body awareness, she is very calm & inspiring. She teaches very patiently, gives modifications for those who aren't as flexible or as strong. There are some ""new agey"" terms or mantra to cultivate the spiritual side & mind/body awareness connection, but much less then her ""power sweat"" or ""power"" dvds.
For each pose/stretch, she tells you what organs it benefits, body system, ailments, or for which people it would help depending on which sport they participate in. She is not overly chatty at all and is good on details making sure you don't overdo it.
She mostly concentrates on simple lying down stretch, 2 lying down spinal twists, downward dog, standing fwd bends, cat/cow stretching w/1 leg up & then also w/knee to nose, crescent (lower leg on ground), mountain & baby cobra.
The setting is a beautiful beach w/waves, dolphin light music and it's in 2.0 or 5.1 surround sound.
The extras are to work w/o narration and a detailed teaching of mountain, downward dog, lunge, baby cobra, and chair seen in it's entirety of side or front views w/even more detailed straight forward instruction.

This is best for those who are beginners, those who want a more spiritual aware basic instruction, or those who want a slow relaxing workout that isn't too physically demanding. Those who want a normal speed workout should try her ""power"" for strength & ""sweat"" for cardio dvds.

You can see an idea of her personality at youtube under her name that shows her other dvd workouts or her advanced, graceful ability.",1190073600,2,1592,4.849264705882353
1804571,5,B00007AJHU,"I LOVE RAINBEAU MARS BEGINNER YOGA DVD.  I purchased this after using Simply Yoga by Yolanda Pettinato.  It was an awesome transition for me as I am in my upper 50's.  This tape is about 40 minutes.  Since I like Rainbeau Mars so much I purchased the set of Beginner, Power, Sweat & Tranquility.  The Power and Sweat were too strenuous for me to advance to after her beginner DVD so I purchased her Dawn & Dusk.  The Dawn is too advanced for me and the Dusk is too slow and definitely for dusk only.  I love her style and am still looking for a DVD to move into after her beginner tape with not such fast movement from one pose to another as I found on her Power, Sweat & Dawn DVD's.  I definitely recommend this tape as a good starter for a young person or as a great intermediate for an older person.  I took yoga classes when I was in my 30's so yoga is not totally new to me.  I feel like the classes help one position oneself correctly and get the breathing right which is hard to get on a DVD.  I hope this helps!",1179619200,4,1019,4.045
1804572,4,B00007AJHU,"This DVD provides a nice lower body workout, and is not too short nor is too long.  Rainbeau has a very soothing voice and the moves are easy enough to follow.  So far my favorite Yoga DVD's have been Baron Baptiste, and I still enjoy him, however I think Baron's are better upper body and this DVD of Mars' is better for lower body.  It is worth the money.",1170720000,2,357,4.144927536231884
1804573,1,B00007AJHU,"If you are not new to yoga and consider yourself intermediate to advanced, you will be wasting your money if you purchase this DVD.  Although the view is perfect and the crashing waves are serene and soothing, for the more experienced yogi, this workout DOES NOT make you sweat.  Additionally, this DVD does not showcase true vinyasa flow yoga.  Rainbeau does not flow, but rather fidgets into, throughout and out of every single pose.  Her voice is also quite annoying, and it definitely does not leave you in a calm and peaceful state of mind after completion.  I did not find this DVD to be challenging, a workout or pure sweat.  If you would like to sweat, build muscle, increase cardiovascular endurance and flexibility, and lose weight/keep in shape then this DVD is not for you.  Instead try ashtanga yoga - that is definitely a weight reducing, sweat producing, muscle building type of yoga.",1170115200,3,899,4.798701298701299
1804574,4,B00007AJHU,"The video is shot on a beautiful Hawaiian island and features Rainbeau Mars performing her Yoga practice on a rock bed with the ocean waters surrounding her. This setting is not only beautiful but the accompanying new age music is both tranquil and blissful.

Rainbeau has a pleasant personality, using many Sanskrit names for the poses, as she leads a series of Hatha Vinyasa style Yoga poses beginning lying down. The moves are somewhat gentle and slow-placed but require enough strength to keep a beginner feeling challenged. While the Yoga practice of this video will certainly leave you feeling very relaxed, it is not exactly ""Yoga for relaxation"" per se, as the poses do engage the muscles some. Rainbeau's ""Pure Tranquility"" DVD would be a better choice for that.

Overall this is a great DVD for Yoga beginners. The only slight drawback for me is that I prefer an all-relaxing Yoga DVD for when I want to relax, and a more challenging Yoga DVD for when I want to really sweat. The Yoga practice of this DVD however, falls somewhere inbetween, and therefore slightly short of either. However, everything else about this video - the set, the instructor and the music - is wonderful, and I'd eagerly recommend this to beginners.",1169337600,5,1234,4.843601895734597

1804576,5,B00007AJHU,"""Uncoil yourself like a flower searching for sunlight."" ~Rainbeau Mars

Rainbeau Mars presents a challenging practice for intermediate to advanced students who want to develop an additional dimension of strength and may I say, patience. The poses require not only strength, but a determination to hold the pose and see results. Downward dog now becomes an exercise where balance becomes a vital part of the exercise. By lifting a leg, you now must not only remain upside down, you must prevent yourself from falling over.

Intermediate and advanced students will love this challenge, but I don't recommend this DVD for beginners. The vigorous strengthening poses flow quickly and alignment and flexibility are assumed. Don't be surprised if suddenly you are crying or feeling an emotional release as some of the poses can help you let go of stored sadness or other negative emotions.

The flowing sequences of poses (moving from mountain pose, to plank, to cobra, to down dog, to warrior) purify and detox the body, so you may also notice nausea or dizziness and definite heat in your body. Breathing heavier should be expected and now and then if out of breath, take a rest in child's pose. Chair pose and deep squats are also part of this exercise session and I found it all very healing and deeply satisfying when I could hold the poses and deepen my awareness. The poses seem to be designed to teach patience and a sense of powerful calm.

Since everyone already wrote all the great & different poses & variations she uses which is diff then most yoga dvds, I can add only that it also has the option of 5.1 surround sound so you can hear the Hawaiian ocean waves behind her.
Her personality is great, she's matter of fact with gentle optimism. Some lines are ""stay conscious of the back, so you're not overreaching, the lower back houses the kidneys, maintain a fullness in your back to optimize good health & alignment,"" ""You must sink to rise up,"" ""extend strongly though the feet, the inner thighs will follow,"" ""with strength in your arms, lower yourself to the floor,"" ""remember to balance your effort w/surrender"" ""if you need to modify, it's perfectly ok, you will still build strength,"" ""even the most beautiful lotus grows in dirtiest of ponds."" She is great with cues to remind you to keep going such as what organs each pose helps, not to get discouraged, that certain postures to open up the hips will help detoxify you which can cause extra heat, etc. & to move through it.

It moves thru a gentle sequence of poses, with emphasis on breathing, that will open your body, mind and spirit in a gentle way. It's particularly excellent if you are having stiffness or pain in your lower back.

Rainbeau is a gifted teacher who comes across very naturally and openly. She radiates sincerity and grace.

The scenery is beautiful which is always a nice addition and is nice to wake up to (especially in the middle of January:) )and the music is a perfect compliment to it.

I would highly recommend this to those new to yoga or those (like me) who have been doing it for years but want to have a gentle routine for those days when you want to do some yoga but don't want to push too hard. I felt amazing after doing this tape (and I've got over 80 Yoga videos) and will use this regularly on those more ""Gentle"" days.

Instructor Rainbeau Mars begins in chair pose, and for the first half of the video, she gradually introduces the poses from sun salutation B--including down dog, plank, push-up pose, and cobra--finally putting all of these poses together in a more flowing series. Next comes a series of standing poses, including warrior 2, side angle warrior, crescent lunge, and chair pose variations. You will also do a balance sequence (includes 3-legged dog pose and leg lifts while in standing forward bend) as well as several standing twists. In addition, short vinyasas from chair to plank to push-up to cobra to down dog are interspersed throughout the practice. At the end of the standing flow series, Rainbeau guides you down to the floor for child's pose and then leads you into a nice relaxation to end the practice at 35 minutes.

I am fairly new to yoga but certainly not a beginner and it is still a little fast for me. I love the bonus section the with five moves or stretches for you to do. She has great instructions and explanations for what each one would do for you. Invigorating and revivng routine. love the pure sweat!,1113004800,5,554,4.336538461538462
1804585,4,B00007AJHU,"Pure sweat is an intense yoga practice which will test your strength, particularly in the lower body.  Instructor Rainbeau Mars begins in chair pose, and for the first half of the video, she gradually introduces the poses from sun salutation B--including down dog, plank, push-up pose, and cobra--finally putting all of these poses together in a more flowing series.  Next comes a series of standing poses, including warrior 2, side angle warrior, crescent lunge, and chair pose variations.  You will also do a balance sequence (includes 3-legged dog pose and leg lifts while in standing forward bend) as well as several standing twists.  In addition, short vinyasas from chair to plank to push-up to cobra to down dog are interspersed throughout the practice.  At the end of the standing flow series, Rainbeau guides you down to the floor for child's pose and then leads you into a nice relaxation to end the practice at 35 minutes.  If you are looking for an intermediate practice to challenge your lower body and leave your thighs burning, Pure Sweat will fit the bill perfectly.",1102032000,,1082,4.9502762430939224
1804586,4,B00007AJHU,"This is the first video of Rainbeau Mars' Sacred Yoga Practice: Vinyasa Flow series. Although it is labelled as a ""Beginners"" workout, I would not recommend it for those totally new to yoga, as 1) the instruction is not overly detailed, and 2) some of the poses present a bit of a challenge and require some strength.  Beginners might also find more helpful to start with Mars' ""Pure Tranquility"" video prior to using this one.

Rainbeau begins the practice lying on the floor in relaxation pose--a nice change--and slowly leads you through some basic breathing and warm up stretches. She then moves to an all-fours position (table pose) for some nice back stretches: there are several different sequences involving cat pose plus a few downward dogs, some of which are held for a fairly lengthy period of time. From here, Rainbeau guides you into a standing forward bend with bent legs, gently encouraging you to open up further into this pose with several repetitions. She also spends a bit of time in a mountain pose variation before moving on to a single sun salutation. This series is done at very slow pace: Rainbeau goes through lunges on both sides and then lowers to the floor in push-up pose, which brings the practice to an end at 28 total minutes.

Rainbeau comes across as sort of a young, hippy chick. She is obviously very knowledgable about yoga--she sometimes uses the Sanskrit names for the postures and provides detailed anatomical information--and she is gently encouraging throughout the practice. Although she cues well, at times her voiceover cuing was slightly out-of-sync with her on-screen movements.

Overall, I enjoyed this practice, which I would describe as gently challenging rather than gentle per se. This is not the video I would choose for pure relaxation, but I definitely will reach for it again when I want a moderate-length, not-too-difficult practice.",1093564800,34,1890,4.9904761904761905
1804587,5,B00007AJHU,"Pure Tranquility is a yoga practice designed to prepare you for meditation by relaxing your body and clearing your mind.  Even more so than Rainbeau Mars' Beginners video, this is a truly gentle routine--the entire 27-minute practice is performed on the floor.  Throughout the practice, Rainbeau reminds you to concentrate on your breathing in order to allow your mind to become focused.  She then leads you through a series of gentle stretches, many of which are recognizable from more traditional stretching programs, such as shoulder and tricep stretches.  After throughoutly releasing muscles in the upper body, Rainbeau moves on to gentle twists for the lower body, always focusing on opening the hips as well.  Although the practice ends rather abruptly, it leaves you in a perfect position for continuing in a seated meditation or reclining on the floor for relaxation pose.

Rainbeau comes across as sort of a young, happy, hippy chick. She provides excellent mirrored cuing and is obviously very knowledgable about yoga. This is perfect practice for anyone who wants a very gentle, very relaxing yoga program, but it would also be a great video for those totally new to yoga and wanting to increase their flexibility through very simple yoga stretches.  Highly recommended!",1092960000,,1282,5.194174757281553

1804589,5,B00007AJHU,"i absolutely love this dvd.  rainbeau mars is a wonderful guide on the journey to inner and outer peace.  this is the first dvd or class to really get me into yoga, and it has honestly made a huge impact on my daily life.  the reason for this is that it's primarily (for me, anyway) a spiritual, meditative practice - not just stretching.  for a beginner with little to no experience with yoga, i would highly recommend this dvd.  it will help you relax and ""let go"" of day-to-day struggles and just appreciate BEING.  other reviewers have mentioned the lack of real physical challenge in this practice, but i've found it challenging because i was very inflexible when i started using it.  again, for a complete beginner with an inflexible, stress-ravaged body and mind, this practice can work wonders.",1084665600,8,802,4.726618705035971
1804590,5,B00007AJHU,"This is a fabulous yoga practice!  Rainbeau, the instructor, is clearly a beautiful person from the inside out.  Her beauty just shines through while she instructs with a picturesque and serene view of the ocean as her backdrop.  The exercises flow nicely as she directs you to either challenge yourself, or to take it easy on yourself by showing you alternative postures.  The thing I love the most are the lovely and beautiful mantras she interjects throughout the video, reminding us of what is truly important in this life, in this body.  Which is without a doubt, the challenge of life itself now days.  If I couldn't do the exercises, I'd play it just to listen to her lovely and beautiful messages.  Enjoy your breath!!!",1084320000,6,727,4.768
1804591,2,B00007AJHU,"Too easy. Even for a beginner, this is a slow and very simple video. I did not find it challenging at all, not even the first time. If you are looking for just a few stretches then check this video out, but if you are looking for a full yoga workout, this will be a disappointment.",1083715200,5,281,4.035714285714286
1804592,5,B00007AJHU,"This has been my favorite video so far. I've been practicing yoga for 6 months now, so I'm still relatively new at this. For me, this is a great morning routine. The poses are intense and that is what leads to sweating. It is not aerobic, like some other ""fat burning"" yoga videos that feel more like aerobics than yoga. The instructor is inspiring and soothing. She reminds you to move with your breath, something that is left out of many of the popular yoga videos.",1076198400,7,467,4.441860465116279
1804593,5,B00007AJHU,"This is my second review of this excellent program. I often like to do a review based on my first impression and then later after living with a program for a while to see how I feel over time.
 I've done this routine quite a few times since I purchased it and it continues to be a very challenging routine. It focuses a lot on the lower body, in particular the hips, through lunge type movements (crescent lunges, warrior 2, reverse crescent lunge, side stretch) as well as ""chair"" movements, which are squat movements. Much of this is also tied in by building through Sun Salutation B.
 This is definitely not a routine for someone who just wants to ""coast"" along because your legs will ""burn"" (at least mine do:)) and you'll truly need to connect with your breath (if you want to benefit in the truest sense of yoga) to maintain some semblence of equanimity in the midst of these movements:)
 Of course the pain should only ever be on the discomfort level (and it can be fairly uncomfortable :) ) without ever crossing over into a level of pain that could result in injury. It is important to maintain complete awareness (which is the main point of Yoga anyway).
  One thing you can do is to start a little above the discomfort and then ease into the pose more and more as you breathe so that you can open up safely. Yoga is definitely NOT a ""no-pain no-gain"" practice so leave that sort of ""gym mentality"" behind if you are new to yoga.
 If you are looking for a challenging and yet still ""real"" yoga practice with an inspiring and knowledgeable teacher I highly recommend this program as well as the other 3 in the ""Sacred Yoga"" series.
 I would suggest buying the 4 program set and you'll have enough variety to work with for a long time (variety in terms of challenges, keeping yourself fresh and excited about your practice so that it doesn't become predictable and variety in terms of being able to respect and work with your energy level).

1804594,5,B00007AJHU,"This is my second review of this tape and after using it for about a year or so I must express again how wonderful it is. These days I have over 60 yoga videos and have been doing yoga daily for over six years (I study with a wonderful teacher as well) so I've got a fair bit of experience with both yoga and yoga videos.
 This tape is Pure Bliss. An excellent tape for anytime you want to completely let go of the tension in your body, mind and soul.
 One way in particular that I love this tape is to use it as a night time winddown. I just finished doing it a little while ago after a long and stressful day and it worked wonders.
 If you are looking for a gentle tape, that is easy to follow and is also enhanced by soothing tropical ocean scenery and perfect background music, then I highly recommend this tape. Rainbeau Mars also is a wonderful teacher who  leads you with grace and clarity.
 Enjoy,

1804595,4,B00007AJHU,"They call this ""pure sweat"" for a reason. This is an advanced Yoga workout for the advanced. Or at least, I felt this workout was a challenge for me and I've been doing yoga for years. Rainbeau Mars really likes ""chair pose.""

Let's just say you do a lot of push-ups without realizing it and I felt like I was upside down for a lot longer in many of the poses. The Vinyasa Flow consists of a lot of down dog and cobra poses. Your face will just be glowing from the increased blood flow/oxygen.

The Ashtanga method tends to produce internal heat and a purifying sweat to detoxify your muscles and organs. You will notice improved circulation and you might even feel a little nauseous or heady at first.

Yoga can heal you when other exercises can just make you stressed. It depends on the level. This workout will help you detoxify, listen to your body, send oxygen to all the body?s tissue and enhance a state of serenity. Yoga helps to clear your mind for days after you workout. You will learn to love this calm state in your mind. You will crave it.

After doing this video, I feel stronger and yet really, really tired. This is a complete all-over body workout. In fact, I think this is comparable to walking on your treadmill for 30 minutes although it is a lot more enjoyable to do yoga.

The setting is spectacular, so if you are looking for an outdoor setting by the ocean, this is one of the Natural Journeys Sacred Yoga videos you will want to own.

Advanced ""Ashtanga-inspired"" Yoga Workout. Great for the winter when you really want to warm your body. In the summer, find a fan!

My daughter started doing yoga, so I thought I would look into it.  As a raw beginner and de-conditioned, I wondered how to start.  The beginner's tape/DVD is perfectly paced with supplemental poses for when you need more.  Of course, the other disks in the set will take you farther as well, but I was so pleased to get going on this and it feels amazing.  I was not very interested in the more ethereal side of yoga as a bio major, but her references are very tolerable and she does relax you.  Also, as a beginner, I have found her instructions to be very clear and helpful in performing the various poses and getting a lot out of them. This is a great way to get a feel for this, although my daughter was skeptical that a tape would be as helpful as an instructor; but I have found the beginner tape to be so effective that I will only need a studio, if I think I am not progressing.  Who wants to go to a studio and feel like a beginner dud?  (This happened the one time I went with my daughter to a beginner class--and I was in reasonable shape at that time) which put me off yoga for years.  BTW the Jane Fonda tape is <NOT> yoga--it was just a regular exercise tape with yoga poses; sort of yoga disco.  Bleh  So, this set has surprised me that it has co-opted me into yoga.  I noticed that it is not currently available but since last fall, I have seen this set and dvd's come and go and come back at various prices.  Also you could start with the separate beginner's tape or dvd and see how it goes.  BTW the download of each of these disks is available on the Rainbeau Mars website for $9.99 each.
