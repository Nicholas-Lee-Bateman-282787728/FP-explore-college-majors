5767821,4,B00D2UMHC4,"I have TA Mat DVD, MetaTeen, 2 dance DVDs, Post-Pregnancy, and one designer series DVD. Yes, I have a lot of them!
This is the FIRST one to really give you good instructions throughout! It is truly for the beginner! There are less reps with each exercise and she goes slowly AND talks to you the entire time! She is encouraging too. This may be too easy for the seasoned TA vet, but she really does emphasize position. It would be a good quick workout on days you don't have time for her longer DVDs. If it's not enough, then do both workouts! There are 2.
So here is why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5. I really thought as I was going through it, 'wow, this one is totally 5 stars!' Then I got to the end, which is cardio, and there was no cool down! Nada! I really would have liked a little something...anything! You have your heart pumping and then she's like, ""Bye!"" Other than that, I totally recommend this one! It's great to get you started!",1376265600,218,949,4.21978021978022
5767822,5,B00D2UMHC4,"This DVD is a must have for any Tracy Anderson Method follower. I loved both 30 minute workouts.
Even though I have been doing the Tracy Anderson Method for several years, this DVD was
very valuable. Tracy explains every move in detail and the workouts really allow you to build
connectivity between your muscles and throughout your body. Both of these workouts are each
different and unique. They are not the same workouts as are found in her book or other DVDs.
The first 30 minute workout is done standing and with weights on your wrists and ankles. It looks
easy but you really have to connect to your body to keep your balance and perform each movement correctly.
The second 30 minute workout is more like her original mat DVD.I highly recommend this DVD for everyone-
whether you are new to the method or you have been doing it for some time.",1376179200,30,848,4.549019607843137
5767823,4,B00D2UMHC4,"I'm reviewing this after doing the second 30 minute workout on this dvd.

I have never done a Tracy Anderson workout until I got this one 2 days ago. I do own Omni but never tired it as I was working my way though another system. I really appreciate that Tracy explains each move as precisely as possible. She also uses great imagery to help you understand the positions i.e. pretend you are holding a basketball and don't want to drop it or pretend you're holding a pizza. You can see her excitement in sharing her method with others and I'm so glad the whole 3 lb thing was explained. The moves seem easy but you will feel the burn. I even had minor DOMs.

I would highly recommend to anyone interested in Tracy's method.",1375920000,98,723,4.348148148148148
5767844,4,B00D2UMHC4,"Yes, it is very basic and definitely for the beginner...but in a GOOD WAY.  Good ""form"" is so important so it's worth getting it right.  Tracy states in the video that once you get the moves down, you should just mute her and put on your favorite music while doing the workout. This is definitely something you're going to want to do so you don't go crazy. It's worth it in the end though.  If you do the moves correctly, they really tone the body the way a woman wants to.  If you are a work-out rock star then I suggest just renting the video so you understand her method before moving on to her other videos.",1493596800,2,611,4.196581196581197

5767846,1,B00D2UMHC4,"I understand that this is for beginners, but it is SO basic and SO slow.  I tried it a couple times and seriously there was nothing that felt like a workout in it.

I wish I could return it but I bought it on my way out of country so I could work out.  big mistake.  BIG.",1491350400,,271,3.7017543859649122
5767847,4,B00D2UMHC4,I bought this together with TA's cardio dance for beginners. This is my first experience with Tracy Anderson but I get why people love her. She's positive and encouraging but not annoying and takes the time to explain all the moves. After several weeks of doing this workout a few times a week (usually followed up with 15 minutes of her cardio dance for an extra boost) I haven't really lost any weight but have noticed that clothes are fitting better and i have more energy. The moves aren't super high impact but I can feel a burn during the workout and my muscles are that good kind of sore afterwards. I'm excited to move on to some of her other videos now that I'm pretty comfortable with the intro level moves. This video is good for someone who wants to learn the basics of her method before advancing and/or is easing back into a workout routine and needs to build up some basic endurance.,1491004800,8,898,4.448484848484848

5767851,3,B00D2UMHC4,"I thought I was buying a series of 30 minute low intensity workouts, but it is actually a very slow long DVD. It would be great for people who have never worked out before, because she slows down the movements to a snails pace, but I was looking for a regular short workout DVD that was not too intense. This is not what I was looking for.",1482278400,,339,4.074626865671642

5767866,4,B00D2UMHC4,"Great beginning DVD for Tracy Anderson. I've tried her other videos before and became frustrated trying to understand the moves. After using the Method for Beginners, I feel more confident moving onto her other dvds that give less direction.",1479254400,2,241,5.205128205128205
5767867,4,B00D2UMHC4,"I enjoy working out to the video and I certainly see changes in my body, the flow of the video is sometimes not great - I'm waiting in a position while she is talking through it and it gets uncomfortable.  Tracy is good at explaining the positions but I don't have a chair similar to what she has so I'm concerned I'm not doing the positions correctly.

I'd like to buy more of her workouts if there is not too many extra props to be used.",1477440000,2,439,4.093023255813954

Beginners- be careful of doing the ""grand plies "" if you're not used to them. Do the demi plies.  I had to take two weeks off exercise so my knees could heal.  Now they're fine and I can do the full plie. I find a lot of exercise routines boring, but this one wasn't due to a few dance steps in it.",1473033600,,455,3.8191489361702127

5767873,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I really like this DVD!  I was having a hard time getting back into exercise at 46.  I used to be a yoga instructor and a year ago took a desk job and sit for most of the day.  It is amazing how tired you get from sitting and thinking all day!  I was really feeling down about my body and I could tell things were south going fast.  I would go all out for two or three days and then fall off the wagon and repeat this often.  I could not get into any rhythm or be excited about any one thing, other than walking my dogs.  I have a ton of other workout DVDs', pretty much all the popular ones, and various pilates (got boring quick) and a treadmill at home.  I was just not excited about anything I had done in the past.  I am so excited I found this DVD.  It is just the right amount to do 2 times a day, before work and before bed and I really like doing it, it is fun, to me!  I look forward to keep going with this program.  I am not sure which one to do after this one.  Suggestions for the next level to try?",1471996800,,1013,3.789473684210526

This one you need accessories like leg/arm weights (which you can actually get by without) and a chair (which everyone should have). But I didn't like it because you need a LOT of room to move around to do the video. We live in the city with a small place and I constantly feel like I am going to kick something or knock something over.

5767914,4,B00D2UMHC4,"If you haven't done Tracy Anderson's workouts before this is a great place to start. She's known for being a little lacking in explaining her workouts, they're more Zumba style where you follow along rather than listen to her instructions. But this video she takes a step back and really talks you through the movements and what areas the movements are for. Be sure to take the time to understand and learn these movements because they really pay off in the long run with her workouts if you do them right.

If you've done Tracy before and regularly workout this video will be too easy for you.",1461801600,6,594,4.5514018691588785

5767922,5,B00D2UMHC4,"Get this before ordering Metamorphosis!
First I ordered her Metamorphosis collection, and felt I was free styling the cardio dance part too much.  So after doing a little research I found out that this dvd was available.  Now everything seems to make sense and I am catching on really fast.  I have no dance background at all so this can be a little challenging at times.  I started out without the ankle and wrist band weights until I got the hang of it.  The added weights help you to burn more calories while you do the basics.
There is a ""method"" to her teaching and it makes total sense.
You just have to stick with it until you master the routine and then move on the more advanced level.
I think this dvd should actually be a part of Metamorphosis so you know from the beginning what to expect, but I am not complaining because I feel great results are taking place.",1454976000,24,873,4.364197530864198
5767923,5,B00D2UMHC4,"Here's the deal.  I bought several of the TA beginner videos.  I have been plagued with various knee and foot injuries, and consistent exercise has been difficult.  Trying to get back in the swing of things and it's winter, so thought this would be a good start.  I am fairly healthy, not necessarily overweight, but not thin and fit either.  In warmer weather, I'm relatively active.  Having said that, I thought this video was very good.  It wasn't ""get my heart racing cardio type thing"", but she does use weights in this video and that is what made things challenging.  Someone else pointed out you do need weights for this.  You need 2lb or 3lb weights (I used 3 and was fine), you also need wrist weights-- bought mine at Target.  They were 3lbs, so 1.5lb per wrist and that is what TA used.  You also need leg weights.  I didn't have any, so I just did it without and focused on technique.  I think TA used 2lb weights for her ankles. After, I did one of the beginning cardio/dance videos just for some extra cardio workout.  The second part is also very good, but I am satisfied doing 1 30 minute workout and then moving on to another 10 minute or 15 minute segment from another beginner video.",1454025600,6,1202,4.429223744292237

5767946,4,B00D2UMHC4,"This is a nice video to those new to exercise or someone really out of shape (like me!). The movements look deceptively easy, but you really can feel the effort your muscles have to exert. The movements are controlled, like Pilates or Yoga. They don't require extreme flexibility to begin with, but over time, you can progress to harder variations. Hand weights, ankle weights, and wrist weights are used in this DVD. If you are short on funds, weighted water bottles and other things you have around the house can be substituted. The extra weight increases the benefits. She has an upbeat personality without being annoying, and there is no cheesy music. My one complaint is that she takes time to to explain various things during the exercise routine, and that breaks up the flow. Once you know how to do the exercise, you want to just do the whole set without interruption. I wish she had done a demo of the moves, and then went on to do the set without stopping. This is silly, but the shorts she wears on the cover picture bug me because they look like they are about to fall off.

5767950,3,B00D2UMHC4,"Tracy gives a good overview of her method of opposing forces to get maximum workout results, but often it is hard without a partner or a mirror to know if you are using the proper form that she covers in this DVD.  Since I found her other tapes too stressful on my bad knees, I stopped using her tapes, but if you can physically handle her workouts then this is a necessary introduction to make sure you have proper form and technique for maximum results",1436918400,,454,4.341176470588235

I usually don't really feel what I've done in exercise until the day after or even 2 days after but I'm already feeling every move I made! She uses ankle & wrist weights in the ""dancing"" exercises which I did NOT do. In my past experience I've been injured using them so opted not to. I don't believe I missed anything in not using them and in fact think I would have never been able to do it with them. Either way I got quite a work out and am very anxious to continue so I can see what results I'll get. I do wish it was mentioned on the cover or before the exercises started that you need a chair, 3# barbells and the other weights if you want to use them. I had to stop the DVD, get what I needed then start over. No big deal.....now I know. The one other thing it lacks is that there's no cool down or stretching after the workout. I did my own because if I didn't I'm pretty sure I'd be wishing I had later.

Due to an old back injury (compression fractures) I have been unable to run or do cardio of any kind for years. After I turned 30 yoga was unable to keep me in the shape I wanted - this DVD has filled the void! I am not disciplined enough to utilize the diet TA recommends in her book but am very happy with the results of the DVD on a bi-weekly basis.
I read a few reviews stating the DVDs did not include enough instruction but I feel they are just right. To me, there is nothing worse than a chirpy, continuous voice telling you what to do during your workout :) She gives instruction, never stop moving and is easy to follow.",1428451200,11,745,4.109589041095891

5767994,4,B00D2UMHC4,"I've had this DVD and the Mat workout sitting on my shelf since last Fall, not really paying attention to them, but about two and a half months ago, I decided to factor the  ""cool "" out of my procrastination (my kryptonite). So, I've been alternating both DVDs, practicing three to four times a week.

What I like about TA's Beginner's:
She does a better job at cuing that in the Mat one.  Well, at least, the cuing is not completely MIA as it is in her Cardio Dance DVDs which I quickly sold back on Amazon.
Her arms and abs sections are KILLER! Trust me. I'm not heavy-set yet far from ""athletic"" and although this DVD is not supposed to be heavy on toning, I have seen real results in the two months and a half I've been doing them. If you truly pay attention to the technique, becoming aware of the ""opposite forces,"" yada, yada, yada., you'll be bringing PURPOSE to each movement.
There's also this sort of grounded yet fluid assertiveness about her approach and demeanor that make me read her as genuine.

What can be improved:
TA could dash more emphasis on how certain movements should look and feel, the where and the how never hurt.
She could do away with the ""good job"" remarks.  At least with how frequent she harps them.  Others may be appreciative of the motivational intent but I simply cringe when I hear them.

Personal preferences aside and over all, I think this DVD is a good intro to her method.",1426032000,3,1416,4.423076923076923

I popped this in last week and had 2 complaints right off the bat.
1. It does not list anywhere that there is equipment needed. I thought if anything my dumbells or kettle bell would be used, but I do not own wrist or ankle weights.
2. This definitely not for beginners, or the less corrdinated of us. Tracey goes right into the moves with little to no explanation. She also does very few reps (4-6), so you don't even have a chance to learn. By the time I got the first move, she was onto the next.
This might be great for someone more coordinated, but not for me. I thought the fast paced issue was just with her beginner dance dvd, but I guess that is just how she operates.

I had surgery on my knee less than a year ago and unfortunately will need surgery for a few herniated discs soon as well. Before that I wanted to get in better shape both to help strengthen my knees and make recovering from my next surgery faster and easier. I can't begin to say how great this is. As it is Tracy's DVD for beginners, it is definitely low-impact which is great. There's no jumping around like a lot of cardio sets. However, your heart rate and breathing will get up enough to make this a very effective work out. It's not super easy which I think is encouraging as you will see results fast, particularly in your arms. It is easy to follow and I like how she doesn't sound too peppy. I don't want to hit her until after a set and only because my muscles are burning! I have already seen some great weight loss results and based on my current path, hopefully will lose an additional 10lbs in a little over a month.

I am a 44  year old female who is learning how to transition from being an energetic jock/athletic driven body (tennis, kick-boxing, hiking, running---that was beginning to experience debilitating sports related injuries for the first time due to natural wear and tear) into a realistic , but still challenging and fun, new era for my personal fitness and joy.

Be patient with yourself, laugh, and start with this video.  Best 10 bux spent in a long while.

The video contains two separate 30 minute sessions -- one is more of a dance cardio with hand and leg weights; while the other is 30 mins. of her mat and arm lessons.

If you are new to Tracy Anderson then you may want to get this video but once you familiarize yourself with her ""method"" you will find yourself never watching this video again.

I would recommend skipping to her Precision Toning workout video if you are looking for more of a challenge. The Precision Toning is four 15-minute workout videos that target different parts of your body. You will find more value in that workout video versus this one.

It really does seem like a direct answer to criticism over the total lack of instruction in her other dvds.

5768045,4,B00D2UMHC4,"great beginning intro to her method

coming from the Westernized ""more is better"", faster is better, bigger muscle is better, mass hypnosis of the fitness industry, it has been a lesson in self awareness, finding my own personal rhythm, chi, and slowing things WAY down..

I have taken dance, martial arts, yoga, gymnastics, Pilates, done intense bodybuilding, taught classes, etc..  so I know how to adapt and change.. and I know learning anything new takes repetitive consistent attention.

i have been doing 3 of her DVD's and the moves are all very simpler, the angles- and rhythm (a gentle - inner self awareness)

this one takes the (from her other DVD's) basic arm and leg angles / movements and combines them standing, with more of an 8 count dance fluid motion- its slow, controlled, and specific- not jumpy or typical western intense style--

it is really effective. this month I have noticed so much change in my body, and energy level. i am reconnecting to my own deep inner source!!

its very martial art based chi - slow, controlled, (tight but loose- use all the body) at the same time-
difficult to explain, the fine, important details are in the repetitive watching and studying, (as she states) and keeping an eye on ones own body.

It's not the typical ""hip hop"", or other bouncy, fast, ""westernized"" motions of ""dance"" we are used to.. ""high energy"".. It's grounding, centered, focused, slow, but flowing... finding your own deep inner energy, focusing on correct angles.. control, small, movements, but not sharp or forced like ballet.

she starts with a warm up/ stretches, arm movement, leg movements, then combines arms and legs (same movements as other DVDs I have) - in repetitive style of constant gentle motion- which raises the heart rate- as well as toning, lengthening and strengthening muscle.

i have fibromyalgia and arthritis and never get pain flares from her DVDS as I do with more intense, fast paced, heavy weight type (faster & heavier are better) exercise programs-

2 30minute segments..

You don't ""need"" anything, but you can choose to use ankle and or wrist weights, or hand weights (weighted gloves), (very light)...  it's not necessary, especially in the beginning when focusing on your body, your form, finding your center, is key..

Just like anything in life, something may or may not be what you want, need, like, or are used to, and lee only know by trying it.  I had her DVD's for years , before really starting to use and enjoy them regularly.. I just wasn't ""ready"", to dig deeper into myself, and let go of all the cultural ideas of ""exercise, fitness, body type, muscles, etc..""...

At 53, I want to go back to my real true self, the me I was as a kid... lanky, thin, lean, tone, energetic.  I've been curvy, enjoyed that.. I've been very lean and muscular for years... , I've been heavy, and ill, in constant pain, and now it's time to return to my true self...  This is helping me do that!!

purchased Jan16.2014
used once or twice.  until this week Aug. 16.2014

I have many other ""exercise"" tools that have traveled with me over the years, that I was just ""not "" ready for, but now I am..

My background - wide - gymnastics, dance, ice skating, ballet, martial arts,  personal trainer, runner, resistance training, kickboxing..loved the cardio class..

 female, but always felt the more powerful, strong, tough energy - rather than the soft flowing energy in this body.

her lack of ""real"" formal instructions (like my brain is used to with ""western exercise""/  result driven, specific muscles or goals  - perfect form - become a 'rock'.. a 'machine' ) was frustrating, yet refreezing, because ""been there, done that""..  plus, since I'm getting older, and the heavy body building, running a mile or 2 a day,  days are gone..  Being a ""hard body "",  was fun, but now I want to learn to control my ""chi"" energy qi -  and flow , and still be strong as I get ""up"" there in the earthly numbers

 Glad I am finally ready to push through the learning curve (of learning any thing new) and just ""do it""...  it ""comes' after we just repeat something over and over.  which is exactly what she says.

I feel my energy flowing in my body like never before after just a few uses this week.. I do 30 minutes a day usually of something ( I have a wide collection of DVD's on all the disciplines I still enjoy - and the only other one that comes close is KATA in the Combat DVD collection.

This is like learning how to use my wings in the arms section, and bring in energy I want, and push away energy I do not want.  Same with the legs , butt and abs... Her angles are hard to see often with the camera guys (I bet) focusing on certain areas of her body, but I thought maybe she wants that , so we focus on our own energy, and not outside comparison...  To feel what is happening in my own body, rather than try to look just like her.  She explained the angles very clearly, and to learn those take time, but by doing, we learn, and we learn by doing... its very TAO - energy flow, opening blocked areas of the body -  I did arms twice yesterday  -  I've always had long arms , large scapula and shoulder bones, and also tend to build muscle very quickly there with traditional pushup / weight type exercise, which actually has limited my ability to use my energy correctly my whole life...

so this is transforming, if you are ready for the ride, or have that flowing, soft, energy already, and just want to get in shape - this is great for you...  No matter what, I believe if you don't like it, wait, and maybe you'll be ready one day, or gift it to someone

If you're ready to spread your wings and fly - and learn to ""feel"" your body, and feel the energy flowing in your body, and start getting really comfortable from inside out - -  from the energy -- flowing - this is for you...

I have a few of her other ones as well.. and they are different but similar. I know now why she calls them metamorphosis..  it's spiritually mentally and physically calming - I have felt more peace and a grounding relaxing sense of my energy than I can ever remember!!",1409270400,16,6104,4.5136612021857925

5768049,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I am a very active individual and was a regular gym-goer.  About 9 months ago I decided to try home workout videos to save time.  I started with Jillian Michaels (where else?) and enjoyed her DVDs, but found that my knees and hips were hurting from all the jumping and plyometrics.  Also, it didn't really seem to be attacking my problem areas.  After doing some research, I decided to try Tracy, and I haven't looked back!

This is a great intro to Tracy, and this is where I started.  Although I was already in pretty good shape, the beginning video was a bit of a challenge.  Tracy's method is a lot different, and you are working muscles that are usually ignored.  The muscles in my hips especially were very weak and tight, and I could immediately sense this when starting this program.

Some of Tracy's ideas (unweighted arms and standing abs) just seemed so bizarre to me, but dang it they give RESULTS.  After doing the intro video for a week or two, I moved on to Precision Toning and Perfect Design Series.

Here are some suggestions that were helpful for me:
Work out in front of a mirror.  Tracy's moves require control, finesse, and some grace. As she says, ""the results are in the details.""  You want to be sure that you are doing the movement correctly so that you get the results and don't get injured.

MASTER THE ATTITUDE.  This was something that was so difficult for me to do, at least correctly.  Because my hip muscles were very stiff and inflexible, and if you have a desk job like me, yours probably are too.  She uses the attitude position over and over again in all of her videos, and if you don't get it down, you can't do the exercise right and/or will just hurt yourself.

I totally love TAM, and I haven't done any Jillian for quite some time. I am getting results that I have never had before, and having FUN with Tracy at the same time!  I highly recommend!",1404777600,84,1889,4.423188405797101

5768068,5,B00D2UMHC4,"Update #2
I ended up SEVERELY  injuring my back when I started doing some of Tracy Anderson's other videos religiously.  I wish I had stopped when I felt the pain but like a dummy I thought I would make it better somehow by continuing to exercise through the pain. I don't recommend that!!!!!!!!!! Listen to your body!!!!! The pain forced me to move to some ultra low impact cardio (swimming/elliptical) which I really do enjoy.  You may wonder why I don't delete the original glowing review below.  Here's the truth: at the end of the day, after many months of recovery time, I still do NOT regret starting my fitness journey with Tracy.  This video got me off my duff and for the first time in my life I actually had fun exercising.  Even with the injury I've lost and kept off 30lbs and it all started with the first half of this video.  If you're looking for a first baby step into exercise, I still recommend this video.  Just listen to your body while you embark on your own fitness journey.  Good luck!

Original review
My name is Anne Athema and I am woefully uncoordinated.  My brain and body movements just do not correspond quickly enough to do dance/aerobics/sports.  It's pretty bad.  I cannot join in the Electric Slide at public gatherings.  Even on a good day I can barely participate in the Chicken Dance.  When it comes to dance aerobics I'm the one in the back row 5 steps behind, dying of shame, and hoping some of the people that I'm bumping into may think I'm freestyling. Suffice to say that in my life dance = anxiety.

That brings me to this video.  As the other reviewers mentioned it is very basic; and that why I love it.  In the first half of the video Tracy teaches you the fundamentals of those basic movements that she very SLOWLY builds into a SIMPLE dance routine.  The first time I did the video I followed the best I could until I was tripping over my feet and gave up to watch the rest of the routine from the couch.  The second time I attempted it I was almost able to finish it without ending in a face plant on the living room floor.  The third time was complete success!  I did the the whole routine WITH KICKS and me and my living room furniture are intact!  Woohoo!

I guess the bottom line is that if you're a beginner, embrace it and consider trying this beginner video.  I don't know if these movements are featured in any of her other videos; there may be no future pay off for learning these steps.  But for clumsy me, the satisfaction I have gained by nailing them was well worth the $9.99.

Equipment needed:
She uses wrist weights (1 lb), ankle weights (2.5 lbs), dumbbells (3 lb), and a chair in the video.  In the beginning I did it without the weights and worked myself up to using them.

Update:
I have lived with pretty much constant lower back pain for much of my life.  The first 30 minutes of the video feels like is I'm getting a massage for my lumbar/sacrum from the inside.  During the warm up there is a point at which I have to keep my knees bent when she is bending to stretch the floor or else I feel that oh so familiar shooting pain - but then during the routine my back starts cracking and popping as the muscles loosen up with the movements.  Afterwards my lower back feels STRONG and warm and blissfully pain free.  I don't know if it's the ankle weights or the stretches or the combination of both but it has been amazing to be free from pain for days at a time.

She states in the video that you should graduate to the next level of difficulty once the video feels too easy.  I made the mistake of dabbling in the Ballet Beautiful videos when I thought I had outgrown this one.  Some of the exercises in those videos seem DESIGNED to throw my back out!  OUCH!  I quickly learned my lesson and have now purchased the next levels of Tracy Anderson videos but still keep this one in regular rotation even though it's been months since I first started this ""beginner""  video.  It has ultimately made me a believer in Tracy Anderson's method.  She has helped me build ""connected strength"" and I feel empowered after her videos in a way that cannot be taken for granted.  I feel so thankful that I was lucky enough to stumble on this video when beginning my journey from couch potato to functioning human being.

Finally, I am really sorry for this long review.  It's just that when something changes your life, you gotta share it, ya know?",1402099200,101,4407,4.374384236453202

I made the mistake of starting with the Metamorphosis Ab centric Program, having never done any of her workouts before.

When I did, I noticed that the sound was messed up on the 2nd workout on the DVD.  At first there was no sound then the sound didn't match Ms. Anderson talking.  However, once I tried the workout I liked the workout so I thought I would purchase a replacement  workout DVD.  This one I ordered from Amazon.
The second DVD came and I got it out of the case and placed it in my DVD player only to find out that the sound was messed up on this one too. The sound must be a problem from the manufacture.  Oh well, that has been my luck and I can still follow along with the workout.
Other than the sound issues, I love this DVD.  The workout is challenging.  It is different from any other workout I have tried before.  I would definitely recommend the workout.  In fact, I have already recommended the workout to several of my friends.",1400371200,2,950,4.131147540983607

My daughter recommended this and her follow up tapes as a supplement to walking, pilates, yoga, and aerobics.  It's helping with the waist area and lower belly that is so hard to improve.  It seems really easy at first, but with all the reps, it gets more intense.",1399420800,6,429,4.693333333333333
5768072,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I read some of the above comments about this being to easy or not challenging enough, and after trying it I have to say to the people writing that, that you clearly most not be a beginner. This video kicked my butt and at times was hard to keep up with the pace since I am a beginner, which I love, the more I do it, the better I get. I am very happy with this product. If I had to pick something I did not care for it would have  be that she does not have you stretch at the beginning or end of the video. There were some parts that she did not explain clearly enough and I did not like the fact that she did not target the stomach muscles that much, but she does explain in the video the reason for that is that this video is to strengthen the small muscles before your larger muscles. And obviously she knows what she is talking about.",1398729600,8,838,3.9585798816568047
5768073,5,B00D2UMHC4,"This DVD is great for those new to TAM.  I am not new but wanted to brush up on the rotations and really learned a lot from her visualizations. Here's the format: Two 30-minute workouts, both mostly toning but the first one covers a bit of the dance movements (without the jumping aspects in the cardio.)  There are some complaints about needing ankle and wrist weights.  This video is instructional but you will get a good beginners workout. She states that the ankle and wrist weights are not necessary but helpful if you want to burn more calories since the workout is not too strenuous for some.  Also, some complained about the talking. I personally loved getting the thorough instruction. She advises people to mute the video and play music of their choice once familiar with the instruction.

  Overall, great beginners workout, much more polished than her earlier DVDS, excellent instruction.  Yes, the music is typical TAM music, but you will be listening to her more.  Also, i is true that there are not many reps but also the movements are a lot slower often which can be more challenging for some.  Enjoy!",1398470400,8,1117,4.740932642487047

I've also used this video to introduce others to her method.",1397779200,6,350,3.943661971830986

How do I know it works that quick - because the first time I did the dvd I was ONLY able to do one side of my leg - that was it... I didn't even do the second side - and I happened to check in the mirror by mistake and my one side of the butt (the one I had exercised) was at least one inch higher than the other one!! That was it for me!!  I have now started doing Tracy's workouts - for 10 minutes a day - I do a body part every other day and it WORKS!!",1397520000,5,607,3.488888888888889

That always made me nervous. How are you supposed to use the correct form if you're moving your body wrong so you can see what she's doing?  That's what I didn't like about the mat dvd and others. I'm pretty good about catching on after a few times but for other people that seems hazardous.

But this dvd has very good instruction. Finally!  She goes through the moves slowly enough and talks about how they should be done. I've only done the first workout today. And I was very pleased with how she changed things up. Very good for beginners.",1396915200,4,720,4.4393939393939394

I know there are those who don't believe what she teaches is worth much..........but I get what she is trying to teach and for me, it has helped me reshape parts of my body (i say parts because I've not done her complete Metamorphosis DVDs yet.  Part of it is because I don't have the space to do stuff like her cardio dance.........but THIS DVD is great.

5768131,3,B00D2UMHC4,"Ive been interested in trying a new workout, Tracy Anderson in particular, for a while now. She even made my top 10 list for 2014 goals, so Im happy to report that its January and Ive picked up her beginner DVD. I thought this DVD might be too basic for me, but Im really committed to trying her full method and other DVDs so I figured I should start from the beginning. This DVD has two parts, and the first part is very basic. If you are like me and work out regularly, it probably won't be much of challenge for you. There is a section of stretches using a chair, an arms section with weights, and then a little dance section that has some toning and a little cardio. She does recommend using wrist and ankle weights, which help tremendously to feel something doing the exercises. I did the first week without them and they were just too easy for me. The second week with the weights was definitely more challenging. Overall, the first part would be good for someone easing into a workout routine, because Tracy does a good job breaking her moves down and starting from the beginning. If you are more advanced, be sure to use those weights.
I am just starting the second part this week for the next two weeks, so Ill give an update on how that goes for me! Happy 2014 and I hope you're keeping with your goals and resolutions!",1390262400,13,1329,4.341365461847389

You'll need a chair and some hand weights but you'll also need arm and leg weights  as well.  I didn't have those but continued with the workout anyway.  I was able to  keep up, which was a nice surprise and now that several hours have passed, I can feel the burn in my arms and legs.

5768173,4,B00D2UMHC4,"Unlike Tracy's other videos, even people who don't work out at all and are looking to start doing so can do this video.  Her other videos are difficult for people who aren't already at least somewhat fit.  I like that she goes over the details of the movements in this one.  There are 2 workouts on the dvd- each 30 minutes long.  I personally prefer workout #2 on the dvd because there's less leg/but work and more arm/ab work.  My butt and thighs have a tendancy to get quite bulky after a few weeks of any fitness routine so I try to not do so much strengthening of those areas.  Tracy claims that her movements won't cause bulk and I hope that's true, but I still keep the butt and thigh work to a minimum so I tend to skip the first workout and go to the second.

She uses 2 dumbells and suggests they be between 1-3 lbs. She also uses wrist and ankle weights.  I just use my 1 lb wrist weights for anything she requires weights with.  I don't see why dumbells are needed as I think the wrist weights alone will do the same.",1386720000,6,1029,4.156565656565657

5768190,4,B00D2UMHC4,"I've been getting into the Tracy Anderson Method very slowly for the past two years. Recently I dropped out of working out because I had my second baby. I found this DVD was a great way to get back into the workout scene and back into the TAM.

If you have fallen out of working out, need something simple to get going again, or want a great intro to the Tracy Anderson Method than this DVD is a perfect option. Tracy takes a lot of time to explain to you how to do the moves correctly for the most effective workout and the best results. I did the 1st workout for ten days and then the 2nd work out for ten days and felt stronger and more prepared to jump into Tracy's 1st Post Pregnancy workout.

Pros:

1) Great intro to Tracy's method.
2) Clear vocal instructions from Tracy on how to do each move.
3) Tracy is, as usual, very kind and patient without being patronizing as she works you through each segment.

Cons:

1) If you are familiar with the TAM method you know that they reuse the same music over and over again. This workout is no exception.
2) Once you've gotten familiar with Tracy's instructions you might find them to be a bit disruptive as you try to smoothly go from one move to the next. I just memorized most of it by the time I had done the 2nd one a few times and would just stop the video while I did all the moves.
3) No cardio. If you want to pair this with cardio you should pick up one of her other DVDs to pair this with.",1384214400,39,1450,4.091549295774648

I'm mad that I wasted time doing this workout - and really, it doesn't deserve to be called that, I hardly worked.  I did the first 1/2 hour of this DVD, and she did so much talking, I probably only moved half of that time.  And what I did was so basic, so easy I was not challenged in the least.  I think I would not have minded so much if at least she worked us the whole time, even if the moves were simple, but there was way too much pausing and her listening to herself talk.  If you're going to play this DVD over and over, as most of us do with our exercise DVDs, the explanations she gives become nothing more than time wasters.  She should have done an instructional piece at the beginning, if she felt she needed to give so much information and demonstration.  If you're looking for the most basic of places to start an exercise routine, I suppose you could give this a try, but you'll have outgrown it in just a few views.  You want to really work out, try something from another Tracey - Tracey Mallett.",1383091200,14,1129,4.054054054054054

I love intro 1 because of the dance routine using weights and I feel like the definition in my legs now are more defined thanks to her Mat DVD and this Intro DVD.

I too, am a Jillian Michaels fan as well... I incorporate them both in my daily work out routine. I like Jillian's pep and upbeat personality to get me going in the am, and Tracy's subdued ways in the evening.",1381104000,6,586,4.051724137931035
5768228,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I really enjoyed the two workouts on this DVD. Note: you will need ankle weights, dumbbells, and a chair for the first workout and just dumbbells and a chair for the second workout. I have done the second workout more simply because it requires less equipment. The first workout is more aerobic with some toning. She does some dance moves slowly but with ankle weight and hand weight to keep the intensity up. I really like this because I just couldn't do any of her dance DVDs. It helps you learn some of her signature moves while still workout at an intermediate level. The second workout is just toning. She does a brief warmup and then onto about 8-9 minutes of arms which I like because it really works the arms from all angles. Then she does about 5 moves for lower body using the chair, 20 reps on each side. I like that we're not doing endless reps but it's still an effective workout. She does talk for a fair amount between moves, but I just keep doing the reps while she talks. Then she ends with a brief standing abs section and stretch. I wish she had done more ab moves and less talking. Overall, I think it's a great introduction to her method as the same moves (with varying intensity) will be on her more intermediate/advanced DVD's.",1380758400,6,1250,4.439130434782609

5768230,4,B00D2UMHC4,"I decided to try the beginners dvd before investing in more of Tracy's dvds just to see if I liked her method.  So far I like it, but the reason for the four stars is because there is a lot of talking and I like to keep moving. On the contrary she does a great job explaining everything.  I do have a dancing background so her moves were a snap.",1380672000,5,345,3.914285714285714

The video also focuses on Tracy's face at times and really, I need to see the exercise-movement to follow along approprately.  It's cheaper to purchase a DVD than to attend most studios so the cost is the same or less if I popped into a class to sample it.  This would be fun for someone who is bubbly who has the space and wants to jump/bop around the room.",1380499200,3,512,4.3125

5768235,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I think this is a fantastic DVD for those that want to try the Tracy Anderson Method (TAM) but find her original workouts too advanced/frustrating to start with.  I'm fairly uncoordinated and have tight hips (forget grand plies!), so I appreciated the slower pace, repetition counts and form pointers.  It's meant to build you up to the next level of her workouts so that you continue to get results and not plateau.  The DVD has two workouts. The first one focuses on arms, glutes, and includes slow/low impact dance steps with ankle weights to help with balance work. The second one is about arms, standing ab work, and legs.",1379289600,3,627,4.73394495412844

I'm open minded and always willing to try something new...including having purchased thousands of dollars worth of equipment...but I always end up back at my bench and free weights for strength, yoga mat for flexibility and running (or walking/hiking) for aerobics.  I'm still vertical and going strong.  I watch some of these flash-in-the-pan videos and honestly don't think they look safe all of the time or particularly effective.  I purchased this DVD despite the also annoying cover (what's with the almost-not-there shorts) and was disappointed.  Her claim to work smaller muscles that are overlooked in conventional methods lacked substance, in my opinion.  Back to my free weights.",1379203200,13,839,5.17037037037037

I work out on a regular, Zumba, Aqua Fit, own about 200 Fitness DVDS, would consider myself an Intermediate Exerciser and this one got my heart rate up a bit. It was my first time doing anything by Tracy Anderson and I found her very easy to follow. The moves were different and I think for that reason my heart rate climbed a bit, not Zumba high but maybe in my low range. I will definitely be doing this one again! Good intro to the Tracy Anderson Method!",1379030400,4,478,4.206521739130435

5768239,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I recently decided to diet and exercise because it was just time and I was looking for an exercise video that was easy to follow, challenging without being crazy like Zumba! This is it! Tracy talks you through each step and also provides alternatives to the more difficult exercises. I didn't have any weights so instead i used 2, 1 pound cans of beans as weights. This DVD offers 2 half hour tutorials but I just started with the first one and I was sweating after. I felt good, energized and accomplished. I did not attempt the second half hour video because I am now starting to exercise after years. I am 150lbs, 5'6"" and want to lose 20lbs for my birthday.

I wanted a low and slow workout to counter doing Crossfit so I thought I would give her another go.
She doesn't breeze through the workouts, but it is a bit sluggish and too ""slow"" for me.",1378598400,4,346,4.164179104477612
5768241,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I have been a TAM devotee for almost 2 years and I can not recommend this video enough. Unlike the Mat video (which is also a good intro to the Method) these two 30 minute workouts are truly designed for beginners who can't physically make it through an hour workout without killing themselves.

Even if you own other TAM videos, in this series she takes the time to really explain the ideas and techniques behind the moves. This video has helped me maximize my results in my other Tracy workouts. It is also nice to have an easier 30 minute workout for the days I am sore or in a hurry.

Heads up! The 2nd workout is where I would start. It is much more in line with a typical Tracy workout. The first workout is good and covers some of her approach to dance cardio, but it is not indicative of other videos.",1378598400,11,809,4.246753246753247

I really like it and I can really feel that it is doing something.  She goes slow and explains everything so you really know what you are doing.  Only thing - there is so much talking about advancing to the next level once you've mastered this - its fine at first, and I do plan on doing that eventually - but I don't like my workout being interrupted by the sales pitch.  I wish there were two versions of each workout on the DVD - the first explaining everything including moving up and the second just doing the workout without interruption.",1378425600,2,730,4.268115942028985

I am so glad that she came out with this DVD because this is the perfect introduction to her method. She explains all the moves in the DVD very well so you really understand what parts of the body you are working and what you should feel as you do each exercises. Yes, she talks quite a bit in the DVD and there are a few cases where there is downtime as you are setting up the next exercise. Regardless, I find this DVD very useful and I will use it for a few weeks before I buy her new precision toning dvd.

The DVD has two workouts. One of the workouts is very similar to the Mat DVD but shorter and easier.",1378080000,20,708,4.01418439716312

This is perfect for me because I tried to start out with the 30 day method book and dvd and although I absolutely loved it, I wasn't yet strong enough to reallydo it and wasn't always sure about my form.  This is still a really good work out and I plan to do this for a couple weeks and then restart the more advanced program.  Also, this workout is all done standing up which very different from her mat work so this provides a modified version for anyone who may have knee problems.  I love this workout!  also, Tracy is really warm, fun and friendly in this workout, guiding you every step of the way.  you will still feel the burn!",1377820800,17,822,4.2709677419354835
5768245,5,B00D2UMHC4,"I am not new to Tracy Anderson and her Method and have actually been doing her workouts off and on since I purchased her original Mat dvd in 2009. I own almost every single dvd and program she has put out (Perfect Design, Metamorphosis, rebounder workouts, etc.) and I am still really pleased that I picked this up. Tracy comes across as very sincere and genuine as she guides you through the moves and explains her unique Method. She counts out reps evenly and explains how to get the most out of her workout, encouraging you to keep at it until you can do the same amount of reps or improve your range of motion. There are two 30 minute routines; the first one is a combination of toning and some beginner dance cardio work and the second is all toning. I have always had difficulty with her dance cardio and in this dvd she really breaks it down into something more manageable (much better than the Perfect Design series Beginner Cardio in terms of instruction). I do believe with practice that I might actually be able to do it someday. This is really the place to start if you are new to Tracy Anderson and her workout. Even if you aren't I think there is value in this dvd. I was worried the difficulty level for me would be too easy and while I am definitely not a beginner in terms of working out or Tracy's Method, it really helped me understand where I should be feeling a move. She is very sweet and does an excellent job with introducing her Method. I highly recommend this dvd and I am looking forward to her release of Precision Toning later this year as well!",1376611200,87,1574,4.357142857142857

The only downside is that after having done this a few times it gets annoying that you have to wait for her to explain the moves so I kind of start dancing or moving around so I don't lose the heat and sweat. I wish it came with two versions, one that you get all the explanations for the first times you do it and one that you can just mirror her once you learned the moves.",1514332800,4,521,3.8333333333333335

Other fitness experts criticized her approach.  Wow! I am so glad that I picked up a couple of her dvds last week because I think that she is going to be my fitness guru!  I started with the Precision Toning dvd,  which is so fun and challenging. The Method for Beginners dvd is quite a bit easier, but I see myself using it weekly. Tracy advises that we should be working out daily so I think that this particular dvd would be great for a ""rest day"".  That's not to say that it isn't a great workout. I definitely feel the burn in my legs, triceps and glutes after completing this.  I have been working out with dvds for well over 15 years ( The Firm, Jillian Michaels, Turbo Jam, Barre and Ballet Body and all sorts of yoga).  Tracy Anderson offers workouts that are fun, creative and challenging. She focuses on light weights, high reps and working the smaller muscles to create a lean build. At 4' 10"" I have to be careful not to bulk up too much.  I can not see myself getting bored with her programs and look forward to accumulating the rest of her dvds.",1500854400,5,1189,4.324324324324325

8588647,5,B00D2UMHC4,"After trying a couple Tracy's workouts on youtube, I bought this dvd along with the Mat Workout for Beginners. I started with the Method for Beginners and did both workouts on the dvd for a week or two before going to the Mat dvd. Now I rotate the dvd's depending on my energy level. Tracy slows down the moves making it easier to learn and explains what each move is working and her cross vector approach, which I like. The moves are very different so it took me a bit to master them. I had flashbacks to my childhood ballet classes -  second position, grand pleas, attitude positions - it's great!  I love Tracy's style - she's not yelling reps or jumping around. She's intense but in a calm, controlled approach. Bottom line is I'm seeing results and would recommend the workout.",1499558400,6,782,4.5
8588648,3,B00D2UMHC4,"I was ready to return this DVD after doing the first workout (there are two on the disk)  I was incredibly dissapointed with how simplistic the workout was.  I have just finished doing Tracy's postnatal DVD for about a month and a half (I'm almost 3 months postpartum) and have really enjoyed watching my body come back together.  Almost all of the moves in it had started to get easy except her double leg ab lifts.  How the heck is a woman that just popped a baby out supposed to do that!?  Anyways, I decided to try the method for beginners before diving into the actual thing since I still can barely get both legs off the ground at once.

The first work out was so simple, I didn't even have my heart rate go up.  It's basically 10 minutes of stretching, 10 minutes of dancing around, and another 10 minutes of stretching.  If it was easy for me (and I just had a baby) and can't imagine who it would be challenging for!  The second workout did redeem it a bit however.  It was still fairly simplistic, but at least I could feel my muscles working during the leg excersizes.  I think I'll do it a few more times and then probably move on to metamorphasis.

Conclusion:  I've decided not to return it, but if you can do the postnatal series fairly well, this will be too easy!!",1498780800,3,1281,4.309623430962343
