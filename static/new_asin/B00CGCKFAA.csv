8581583,5,B00CGCKFAA,"This is a classic Angelina Ballerina DVD that is full of dancing and songs.  Very cute and musical.  My kids (my boys and my 2 year old daughter) enjoyed it and we have watched it a few times now.  I love though how Angelina and her friends work together to solve problems, make decisions and be a good friend.  It is full of great lessons for preschoolers and very simple for kids to understand.  This is a great DVD whether you have an old or new Angelina fan!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1377648000,,536,4.257425742574258

8581585,5,B00CGCKFAA,"My three year old daughter Paige is going to be the musical one in the family as she loves anything to do with music and dance. She has always loved Angelina Ballerina but I knew she'd be especially excited to watch Mousical Medleys since it has an emphasis on music as well as dance.

Angelina is a spunky little mouse with a talent for dance and fun friends that she has many adventures with. Things don't always go according to plan for Angelina but she has a way of working things out. I like that this DVD encourages working together and solving problems; perfect for my three year old!

""Angelina's Camembert Parade"" was Paige's favorite episode because we recently went to a parade and she can't stop talking about it. It's funny the things that stick in kids mind at certain ages. We have been to many parades before but this is the first time it really made an impact.

Angelina Ballerina: Mousical Medleys is clean fun for your toddler and even those that aren't into music and dance like my son will enjoy!",1373414400,,1017,4.516304347826087
