1896949,5,B00009Y3S7,"This workout has helped me tremendously!  I started using it in my 2nd trimester, and am now in my 3rd.  Because the workout is fairly short, I'm able to do it almost every morning.  It helps tremendously with lower back pain, my major pregnancy complaint. When I miss a day, my body complains.  I like that the workout is fairly short--if it were any longer, it would be harder to fit into my schedule.  Thank you, I just ordered the post natal workout and am greatly looking forward to it.",1073260800,23,491,4.411111111111111
1896950,5,B00009Y3S7,"This DVD was highly recommended to me and I couldn't wait to buy it. After I read the review on Amazon, I was concerned about not being able to skip to each workout.  I contacted the company directly through pilatesforpregnancy.com and they assured me that this problem has been fixed.  They were right and I have been reaping the benefits of this workout ever since.  I am in my third trimester and I feel fit, relaxed and in great shape!  I cna't wait to buy the post-natal DVD and to get the chance to workout with my baby.",1064707200,26,526,4.336734693877551
1896951,3,B00009Y3S7,"I like it, however, I was expecting an hour long workout. It was only about 30 min. It's great if you want some exercise, but don't have a lot of time. I'm a yoga insturctor so I was hoping for something a little more, but maybe I'm being too hard on it due to my experience.",1142380800,,275,3.9285714285714284
1896952,3,B00009Y3S7,"I did quite a bit of pilates before pregnancy and was a little dissapointed at the simplicity and lack of challenge of this video. Overall it is pleasant and not outdated like many prenatal videos, but I just didn't find the challenge I was looking for...and of course many traditional Pilates moves can't be done after your first trimester because they are on your back. However, if you are new to either Pilates or exercize (and have plenty of pillows for the props) it is a pleasant beginners video and has a workout for each trimester.",1142208000,5,539,4.625
1896953,2,B00009Y3S7,"I rented this, and did it for the first time this morning. It has three different workouts, one for each trimester. I did the second trimester one.

At the beginning of each workout, it tells you who is doing the workout, and at what stage of pregnancy she is. That is nice. The ""instructor"" sits or stands alongside the pregnant lady, coaching her in the poses and such (wouldn't it be nice if we all had that help?). The instructions come in the form of voice-over.

Ok, what I like about this workout:

- It takes some of the pilates that I know and love from pre-pregnancy and modifies them so that I can still do them. Things that I used to do flat on my back are now done on an incline (pillows and blankets)

- It looks like it was filmed in a living room, and that is cool.

- It felt good to do some pilates again. I miss it.

 Here are the flaws, as I see them:

 - WAY too short!! I think that each workout takes maybe 20 minutes, BUT - half that time is explanation (How to Build Your Incline). There should be a straight through workout for those who are used to the program.

- I always hate things that call for you to stand against a wall, because all my walls are covered with furniture! I can use the archway into the livingroom, but it always annoys me.

- It uses soupcans as weights, and doesn't mention that you could also use weights (I did).

- The breathing is not very clear.

- I wanted more ""interaction"" with the instructor and the pregnant lady. I felt like an observer, not a participant. I am going to try some other pre-natal pilates workouts.

I don't see this as keeping me happy for months to come. I am glad I rented and did not buy.",1133308800,19,1670,4.161993769470405

1896955,4,B00009Y3S7,"As an avid fan of pilates, this video allows me to continue with some of my pre-pregnancy moves (modified of course) and is brief enough that I can squeeze it in with the rest of my workouts during the week.",1111190400,8,207,4.2
1896956,5,B00009Y3S7,"Pilates is a terrific exercise form for developing the deep core muscles needed for giving birth. I credit this video with helping me (a first time mom) have a relatively short labor and delivery and a fairly quick recovery.

This video offers clear, concise instructions about how to do pilates exercises while you are pregnant and how to maintain strength and length throughout your entire pregnancy. The video does a great job  demonstrating proper technique and modifying exercises for each trimester.

I recommend this to any mom-to-be who wants to stay strong during pregnancy.",1110067200,9,583,5.180851063829787

1896958,5,B00009Y3S7,"I'm in my third trimester and am beginning to feel tired, heavy and uncomfortable. This workout was just the perfect amount of exercise and intensity for how I am feeling. I know I'm supposed to workout regularly, but am really not in the mood lately. This DVD allows me to get my workout in, without overdoing it.

It is also a great accompaniment to your usual aerobic activity.

Thank you Prenatal Pilates! I look forward to using your other products after my baby is born.",1097020800,12,476,4.588235294117647
1896959,3,B00009Y3S7,"The 2nd trimester program runs only 14 1/2 mins, and I imagine the other 2 trimester workouts are similarly less than 20 minutes since the dvd as a whole only runs for 57 minutes, and that includes instructions.

It's still not a bad program -- but less than 15 minutes is a bit dissatisfying.",1096416000,13,293,4.425925925925926
1896960,3,B00009Y3S7,"I'm in my second trimester.  I practiced Pilates to relieve lower back pain before conceiving and was disappointed when I realized I couldn't continue beyond my first trimester since most of the exercises have you lying flat on your back.  This video, however, shows modifications so that I can continue doing the exercises I love.  True, it's not as intense as regular Pilates, but the point now is to maintain fitness and relieve aches and pains, not to make fitness gains.  I find that I get a good workout if I do the second trimester sequence twice (20 minutes total) and really focus on the muscles I'm working.  I had started to re-experience lower back pain when I had to stop regular Pilates but thanks to this video, it's starting to fade.  I think this video would be best for women who've had some Pilates experience since the instructor doesn't talk much about technique, but beginners could still benefit.",1090627200,7,919,4.748427672955975
1896961,4,B00009Y3S7,"I'm not one who exercises regularly but when I got pregnant I was told (again and AGAIN) that I must. I don't like walking and I refused to buy a maternity swimsuit (it's not so much the vanity as the price of these tents!) so I decided to try yoga. I bought a yoga book and a yoga mat... but alas, yoga wasn't for me. Not only did I find it extremely difficult to follow written directions (yoga directions are anything but succinct) but I also fell asleep while doing the breathing exercises. So I learned my lesson: I need something that shows me what to do and something that requires a bit more movement. This is where this DVD comes in. I found the directions simple to follow, especially as they were acted out in the DVD; I found the exercises easy to complete and the time required was short enough that I could actually stick to doing this routine (well, most of the time...).

There were some flaws however:

1. the woman giving instructions talks in a weird intonation and there were some things I just couldn't understand regardless of how many times I re-played them. E.g., I still don't know if she says to breath out my nose or my mouth!

2. the instructions don't always synch perfectly with the action, especially when she goes off on a tangent mid-exercise; so when you're supposed to be breathing in she suddenly says to breath out. What I did was learn the exercises (for the final trimester I just watched the DVD and wrote down the exercises since at this point I knew the names pretty well) and do them without the DVD playing in the background to distract me.

3. I couldn't do all the exercises for various reasons (my writsts are too weak for a couple of the routines, and I don't have a wall in my house I can use to lean against with enough space to follow the directions). But I found that what I could do was sufficient for my level and I can definitely feel the benefits of a stronger back, legs, and muscles.

In short, if you're not an exercise-daddict I recommend this DVD and this routine for you; I liked it enough to buy the post-natal version. If, however, you're very athletic and already in good shape you may want something a little longer and probably a little more active (I'm assuming... I don't know how athletic people cope with pregnancy since I'm not one of them).",1090540800,79,2313,4.42018779342723
1896962,1,B00009Y3S7,"I had just found out I was pregnant and wanted to get a couple of DVDs to do at home to replace my non-prenatal DVDs.  I had never done pilates before and after seeing the reviews thought that this would be a good DVD to try. I only did the DVD once and that was enough.  My biggest complaint is that the instructor did not take the time to explain the proceedures up front so that you could learn the move and then do the exercise. I found this so extremely frustrating that I just stopped trying.  Also, I found the tone/ambiance of the DVD to be somber to the point of being boring.",1086998400,3,585,4.114035087719298

I was hoping to have a video that I could do at home, but this was a giant dissapointment.  It is now collecting dust in the back of my DVD collection.",1333065600,,314,4.016129032258065
7994324,3,B00009Y3S7,It's OK but not what I expected. It divides the workout in trimester. Each workout lasts about 20 minutes. Short workout for me but cool when I don't have much time.,1298332800,,165,4.354838709677419
7994325,2,B00009Y3S7,"This DVD was very disappointing to me. I didn't realize when I purchased it all the things you need to work out with and all the space you need. They require 2 soup cans, blankets and pillows. The worse of all is the space situation. They do most of the exercises against a wall that you need lots of space for. I actually hang pictures and such on my walls and couldn't find a big enough section of my wall with nothing on it or nothing infront of it. Also they don't tell you this but you need to do the floor exercises leaning up against a hard surface like a couch. I have a coffee table infront of my couch and being 7 months pregnant it is solid wood and too heavy to move on my own. And just to add to everything else, the pace of the workouts are very fast. When you are starting out and are not familiar with the exercises it is very hard to keep up with them. They go so quickly from one work out to the next.",1289260800,,919,3.972972972972973
7994326,3,B00009Y3S7,"I checked this out from the library and did the 2nd trimester workout.  I probably won't do it again.  I would say that doing this dvd was better than doing prenatal Pilates exercises from a book, which I've tried before, but the instruction was confusing and too fast and just the way it was presented in this DVD makes me not want to do it again.  It's too bad, because I feel like I'd like a private teacher to take me through the same exercises and I bet I'd get a lot out of it--but there's just too many questions I couldn't ask the DVD--definitions, breath, etc.--and I don't feel like watching the same thing repeatedly to see if I could understand it better.

Maybe it would be good for someone who's done a lot of Pilates before--I've done some, but not tons--but I think someone who's done enough to easily understand this DVD wouldn't need to do it, as they'd already know enough to do it on their own.

Each of the trimester workouts is so short; I don't understand why they couldn't have been lengthened to include a bit more instruction prior to jumping into each exercise.",1250380800,,1088,4.447236180904523
7994327,2,B00009Y3S7,"At first I really thought I liked this DVD, but after my third pregnancy my opinions have changed. It is impossible to do any of these exercises with kids, because so many our on the floor. And when I get on the floor, my kids think ""tackle mom!"" Also, as you progress you need someone with you. My husband and I can't consistently carve out that time when we have our 2 boys, dog, and house to take care of, as well as prepare for our 3rd child. And if we could carve out that alone time, let's just say an exercise video wouldn't be our top priority. Also, I can not find a wall where I can do the exercises while still watching the video, and I've lived in different places and had different living room set ups.

I must say Sarah is darling. I enjoyed her tremendously, and I don't doubt this keeps you strong, but it isn't practical for me. I thought I didn't like fit mama with my first and now I realize it is my essential workout for labor and delivery. Amazing how time and kids change your opinion. By the way, I am a stay at home mom.",1193616000,,1045,4.122549019607843
7994328,5,B00009Y3S7,"This DVD was a great addtion to my work-out routine.  I love to go for a brisk walk and come home and do this DVD.  Sometimes I had more energy to ""add"" an additional set while the instructors were transitioning.  While doing the DVD sometimes I thought I wasn't doing much, but by the time I was finished I could feel my muscles were very fatigued.  That is the great thing about Pilates! I bought this DVD when I was pregnant with my 3rd baby.  I gained 18 pounds less with that preganancy than my others.  I will be using it again fatihfully now that I am expecting #4!!!",1150848000,4,574,4.220183486238532
7994329,5,B00009Y3S7,"I got this as a gift, and I love it. It might not be for the woman who was a hard-core exerciser before she was pregnant, but it's perfect for the rest of us. Workouts are short enough that you aren't just watching the clock wondering how much more you have to do, but long enough that I feel I've done something good for myself and my baby. The workouts are nice and gentle, like a prenatal exercise program should be. Especially as I get bigger, I really appreciate the features that others have complained about.",1149552000,3,515,4.375
7994330,2,B00009Y3S7,"I gave this DVD a try, despite the other negative reviews that stated the work out was non-existant.  I had been doing pilates at a beginners/moderate level for 6 months prior to becoming pregnant, and figured that perhaps what was too easy for most, would be ok for me.  WRONG.

This DVD is comprised of 3 workouts- one for each trimester.  Each is approximately 15 minutes long.  And in that 15 minutes, you're doing about 8 minutes of a workout.  Honestly, if you can call it that, because when I was done, I felt like I had done nothing.  I spent more time getting the ""supplies"" needed for the workouts, than I did working out!  (For the 2nd tri you need something like 4 blankets, 3 pillows, 2 soup cans, 2 towels.)

Anyway, I don't see how doing this workout could do much for your body.  And, I felt that still being a moderate pilates user, they didn't do the best of job explaining some of the techniques either- which made for some rewinding of the DVD to get it right.  Honestly, I tried each of the trimester work outs and then I sold this DVD.  Not worth keeping around.",1149120000,9,1084,4.365
