8371104,5,B002IRYYL4,"Chagum, Balsa, Tanda, and Torogai have set out for the village of the Yukue to learn more about the destiny of the Guardian of the Spirit. They hear the legend of the previous Guardian. He was cut in half by a demon that eats the egg hidden within the Guardians body. They escape the village after the Emperor's troops arrive. Torogai was able to turn them away and convince Shuga to go home and try to find a way to kill the demon that will soon appear for the egg.

After leaving the Yukue village, they decide to seek shelter from the harsh winter. A large cave that has been converted into a living space will be their home until spring. They stay there and await the time when Chagum will seek out the place to let the egg hatch.

This is a great volume, the emotions of the characters really start to surface. All the pain, desperation, and love that the characters have experienced so far has reached it's bursting point. Now more than ever, they need to stay with each other and be strong. The only way they can save their country from a terrible drought is to protect each other. This series gets better all the time. I think that everyone should watch Moribito. It's a great story.",1357862400,,1191,4.384615384615385
8371105,5,B002IRYYL4,What can I say about this Anime besides good story and great animation? I was happy to hear that Funimation picked up this title after the collapse of Geneon. and it has been worth the wait! Morabito has intriguing characters and I certainly hope that the other Morabito book gets made into a series as well.,1257897600,,308,4.517857142857143
