8202873,5,6302123070,"I just received this and so far it hasn't been removed from my VHS player, (I believe this was only available in the VHS format, from 1988) Excellant all around, if you are a Level 42 fan you will love watching this musical tape that has some of the rarest footage and some of the best tunes around!  Sure it's an much older tape, but that's really what makes this so special, you see Mark King's delightful sense of humor, Mike Lindup is also a gem.  Both with the nicest personality and of course the talent really shows through as well as there is lots of music and concert shots as well, if you like watching Mark play (and who doesnt?), then you will be in heaven watching this as well.  And he can talk without sounding like some conceited rock star, he is a gentleman all the way, he speaks of he and wife just having a baby and you even though he is quite light about it, he is beaming from the birth of his new child.  Lots of great insight on their begingings and where they are going, or have been. It's just that nice.  The guys are funny as well, makes for great entertainment, Love the Music, always have and it's a true joy to own this tape.  100% Recommmended.",1184198400,,1176,4.227678571428571
