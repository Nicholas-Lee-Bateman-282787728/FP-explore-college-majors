This thing was unwatchable save for the sport my friends and I had at its expense.  The real shame is that its not even in the ""so bad its good"" category.  Its in the just bad...its bad category.

6454770,5,B00KZJX8S2,"Hazmat isn't available on DVD yet, but it is on Hulu and that's where I watched it. It's a very good slasher movie that reminded me a lot of My Bloody Valentine. It is not only gory (though not too gory), it is also suspenseful and scary, which is something that most of today's slasher films can't boast. And the ending sets up a sequel, that I hope does happen as Hazmat is one of the best horror films of the year!",1407024000,4,417,4.097560975609756
6454771,5,B00KZJX8S2,"This movie was excellent. As a lifelong Horror Hound always trying to find the next great film in psychological slashers, I tend to go through roughly 15 bad films till I come across a satisfying one. This movie satisfied me on all levels. It has to do with a reality TV show called Scary Antics. The show features friends setting up each other, scaring them. This particular show goes horribly awry...
If you are a lover of Psychological Slasher Horror Films such as myself, you probably won't be disappointed with this one.",1406678400,2,525,4.717391304347826
6454772,2,B00KZJX8S2,"A reality TV show that sets people up to be scared opts to film in an abandoned chemical plant that had a fire (good luck with that permit). It seems Jacob (Norbert Velez) whose father worked there and he played there as a kid, thinks it is haunted. He appears to be obsessed with the idea so much his friends have grown tired of him to the point of playing a professional prank with the aid of a film crew and make-up artist.

Of course the first ""twist"" comes after they pan in on a new fire ax which then goes missing after Jacob thinks his friend was murdered. I kept hoping for a real twist, i.e. a joke being played on the girls or the camera crew, etc. because the film grew into a real boring slasher.

This is a very generic slasher film, one you will quickly forget. The acting was sad with Daniela Larez unable to deliver a line.

6454773,5,B00KZJX8S2,"This movie is straightforward slasher flick; and on that note it delivers. Do not expect deep character development - the genre does not lend itself to that, and besides, that would only take away from what you came to see.

The movie's premise is ingenious: a group of friends sets an unsuspecting ""victim"" up on a hidden-camera TV show. The point is to scare him and laugh about it later, only things go horribly wrong.

It's an enjoyable slasher flick, and good for a few nifty scares.",1456704000,,488,4.597701149425287

6454777,4,B00KZJX8S2,"When I discovered that director/producer/screenwriter Lou Simon (THE AWAKENED - 2012; AGORAPHOBIA - 2015) was actually a woman, truth be told, I was taken aback a little bit. Not because this is a bad film, but because there is not one bit of feminism in this slasher film. As a matter of fact, two of the main actresses' characters are real pain in the asses. The film opens with two young women trapped in a hotel with a psycho chasing them. One of the girls stabs the psycho and he shoots her dead. The psycho points the gun at the other woman and says, ""Are you scared?"". It all turns out to be a prank played by the dead girl on the living one on a TV show called ""Scary Antics"" hosted by David (Todd Bruno), also known as ""Scary Dave"" and their regular psycho player is Tim (Mario Nalini). The show is in trouble of getting cancelled if the ratings don't improve, so David makes the pranks being pulled meaner and meaner, which upsets makeup person/special effects artist Brenda (Aneila McGuinness), who also happens to be in love with David. Their next episode is set up by Adam (Reggie Peters). His friend Jacob (Norbert Velez) is getting weirder and weirder, so much so, that his nickname is now ""Creepy Jacob"", so David wants to shock him back into reality. Also in on the joke are Carla (Daniela Larez) and Melanie (Gema Galero), who are really doing this for the TV exposure, hoping to turn their appearances into show business jobs (How many real-life reality stars have done the same thing and failed miserably? Some even committing suicide because their dreams didn't come true?). Adam picks an old warehouse, where there was a deadly fire years ago that killed many people and now it is said to be haunted, but it seems Jacob knows everything about it because his father worked there (More on that later.). Something tells me that this practical joke is going to go very, very wrong, especially since most psychiatrists would diagnose Jacob as being emotionally unhinged. The foursome enter the warehouse after David and his crew have set up the internet and hidden cameras (their budget is so low, they are only able to rig the front half of the warehouse, so everything in the back of the warehouse is not covered) and Jacob heads directly for the office, which is the Control Room for David and his team. The walls are thick and a big metal bar slides across the metal door, so it is impossible to get in unless you are let in. If Jacob were strong enough to break down that door, the joke would be blown and the episode scrapped, which would mean certain cancellation, so Adam talks him out of it and they all go exploring. Jacob use to spend a lot of time at the warehouse when he was a kid, so he and Adam go off together, while the two girls are left on their own. Jacob tells Adam that his late father once worked here and he believed the place was haunted. Jacob says his father once saw a man's skin dissolve off his body, but when the police arrived, the man was dead, but he had all his skin (Is it possible that Jacob's father was a murderer?). Adam is disgusted by the story and tells Jacob that he is losing touch with reality before he walks away. Jacob finds a white hazmat suit in a locker and puts it on, which scares the hell out of Adam. You see, Tim is supposed to appear in the very same type of hazmat suit and ""kill"" Adam. Tim puts on the suit and Adam screams (part of the joke). When Jacob and the two girls find Adam, he is bloody and ""dead"" (also part of the joke). Jacob and the two girls run in different directions and, so far, the practical joke is going perfectly. Both girls scream in different directions, leaving Jacob to decide which way to go (again, still part of the joke). Tim comes behind Jacob in his white hazmat suit and gets a fire axe planted in his stomach (definitely not part of the joke). David and his crew witness the whole thing from the Control Room and Jacob disappears from the hidden cameras by going to the back of the warehouse. Adam and the two girls have no idea what is going on, so David leaves the Control Room to warn them and to also tell Jacob that this was all a practical joke. It seems Jacob has picked up some of his dead father's bad habits, though, as he kills Adam with the axe to his stomach when he sees he's really alive. Everyone in the Control Room know that everything that happens is now their fault. Jacob, dressed in a bloody white hazmat suit and gasmask, begins destroying all the cameras he can see, which limits what the Control Room can see (Steven [Tom Stedman] says, ""I think he knows he's on the show!""). David finds Adam's dead body and is nearly killed by Jacob, but he ducks Jacob's axe swing and barely makes it back to the safety of the Control Room. One of their technicians, Gary (Geordan Deaz), is still outside the Control Room, so David tries to radio him to call the police, but the thick walls and metal door garbles the transmission and Gary makes it to the Control Room (Of course, David made everyone leave their cell phones in the van so there would not be any interruptions). Carla and Melanie discover Tim's dead body and realize the joke is over (but only after kicking his dead body a few times!). Jacob appears behind them and plants the axe in Carla's back, as Melanie runs towards the Control Room. David doesn't want to let her in, but level-headed Brenda opens the door and lets her in just in time. Ed (Dennis Spain), one of the show's techs, returns to the warehouse to pick up the equipment (the show should have been long over), but Jacob pulls him into the building and chops off one of his arms. Ed and Jacob appear at the Control Room door and Ed says Jacob will kill him in 30 seconds if they don't let him in. Needless to say, Ed ends up with an axe blade implanted in his stomach. David and Steven sneak out of the Control Room to find the back door (the map is on Tim's dead body), but Jacob finds them and Steven ends up with the axe planted in his skull. David tells Brenda (via helmet camera) that he loves her and he makes it to the back door, only to be pulled back in by Jacob and we see David's decapitated head fall to the ground. Jacob kicks David's head back into the warehouse and closes the back door. The last three left, Brenda, Gary and Melinda, leave the safety of the Control Room to get out the front door, but Jacob has made it impossible to open. They head back to the Control Room and find another exit on the map. Brenda leaves to see if it is open. Alas, it isn't, so Jacob chases her back to the Control Room, only they aren't able to close the door in time and Jacob gets in. He impales one of Gary's eyes with the pointy end of the fire axe, while Brenda and Melanie run for their lives. Melanie is killed when she has one of her arms cut off while holding hands with Brenda as they are running away and Brenda is choked and lifted off the ground by her neck while Jacob reaches for the axe, which is propped against a wall. The axe falls to the ground and Brenda is able to break free. She is able to make it to the door and outside, but then she is pulled back in and the film ends with the screen turning red.  I could have thought of a better ending with my eyes closed (How about the whole thing was a huge practical joke on Brenda for wanting to leave the network?), but director Lou Simon apparently ran out of ideas with her screenplay (my suggestion would have worked perfectly) and gave us the cop-out ending, leaving it wide open for a sequel, but for a slasher film (also known as HAZARD), it's not that bad. It's a mixture of ""found footage"" and normal filmmaking, but since all the cameras are basically stationary, it didn't hurt the story (it still had that sickly green night-vision that I hate with a passion). This is slightly above-average for a slasher film, but would have been so much better if Jacob used various weapons, not just an axe. While there is extreme gore on view, some of it goes by so fast that you have to pause the disc (or your streaming service) to see it better. I get the feeling that Ms. Simon was trying to create a new horror icon here and it would have worked if we didn't see his normal human face and if he had above-average powers (although he did a good job lifting Brenda in the air by her throat). It's apparent that Jacob has a few screws loose, but there's nothing here that puts him in the same class as Michael, Jason or Freddy. It works perfectly as a slasher film (using a reality show as a backdrop is old hat by now, though) and it would be interesting to see what direction it would take in a sequel, but give him more than an axe to work with the next time. All technical levels of the film are above-average and so is the acting by a cast of relative unknowns, but it could have been much, much better if Jacob was given more to work with besides an axe. Everyone is talking about the Soska Sisters, but this film is better than most of their films. People should start talking about Lou Simon. Made in Miami, Florida. Also featuring Brandi Rudicil and Massiel Checo as the two women in the beginning of the film. An Uncork'd Entertainment DVD Release.",1449014400,3,9187,4.331979106210099

8662862,3,B00KZJX8S2,"In the beginning of Hazmat we see two female friends afraid for their lives in a building holding knives and looking for a way out.  They can't open the exit door so the one friend stabs the killer when he appears.  What the!!!  It was all a set up!  The one friend and the bald headed guy were both in on it.  She was a member of a show called Scary Antics, a show about poor and innocent people who are set up by those they love and trust just for the purpose of scaring and embarrassing them.  A guy named Dave introduces viewers to this Scary Antics show. We see a building that was home of a horrible chemical explosion in the 60's.  In a blunder the black co-worker wears the wrong shirt, they can't get the front door open but mention they have to adhere to the fire code.

Dave interviews a man who says his friend Jacob changed a lot.  Another woman thinks this  Jacob dude is creepy because he doesn't say anything and when he does, he creeps people out.  The people who know him think he's a serial killer.  Others think he's awkward, dark and unlikeable.  Jacob has a crush on one girl.  Jacob thinks this chemical building became haunted after his father died.  The group thinks if they scare the crap out of Jacob he'll loosen up and be a normal person again.

A female worker/girlfriend of Dave's complains about not getting enough money.  Dave says he can't help it since the company keeps cutting his budget.  The woman says she'll stay if he makes some changes.  She says the pranks are getting meaner and meaner, but Dave says that's what the audience wants.  He says he does what he does for his girlfriend and his daughter.  An electrician tries to hook up the lights in the back and says he hates this job.  The group goes over the plan- trying to convince this Jacob guy that this building is really haunted.  One man will dress in a biohazard suit.  A camera will be installed in the helmet.  The girls will find a body, scream and run over.  The guy wearing the suit will jump out and scare Jacob.

Jacob arrives with a few friends.  He speculates that the government was responsible for a chemical accident, or maybe they set the place on fire on purpose to get rid of the evidence with the workers inside.  Workers kept having freak accidents so they had to shut the chemical building down.  They unload lanterns from the trunk of Jacob's car and head inside.  Meanwhile the production crew watches Jacob and his black friend enter.  Jacob struggles to get the door open.  He notices the security system on the ceiling.  The production team recommends moving quickly in case Jacob finds something to break the door in.

Jacob mentions he spent a lot of time here as a kid.  The women split up and head down dark hallways.  The TV production team compliment themselves on how well they covered this building.  Jacob says he doesn't believe his father's death was an accident and told Jacob he thinks the place is haunted.  The father apparently saw one of his workers get possessed.  They found a guy's body whose skin wasn't intact.  Jacob's black friend says he has to stop telling these stories and that it's getting harder to be his friend because he creeps people out.  ""This is why people don't like you Jacob"".  To be honest Jacob strikes me as very normal.  Just saying.  He's nothing at all like the criticisms I've heard about him.  He seems enthusiastic to enter this place and discover something.  That's not the sign of someone who's weird.

The two girls get into an argument.  The one says someone has to shake up Jacob before he loses touch with reality, but the girl disagrees and thinks the other girl is all about being obsessed with her boyfriend.  She responds by reminding the girl why she's here- to be on national TV.  ""How's that working out for you?""  Jacob finds something, but he insists they get out of here.  The guy from the TV production team puts on his biohazard suit.  The one guy from the production team says this is his last show and he's moving up.  This upsets the female employee who threatened to leave earlier.  She thinks she deserves a promotion.  ""Is it because I'm single?""  The one guy responds ""No, it's because you're a woman"" and she flicks his head.

Jacob sees the man in the biohazard suit.  He's lying there dead.  Jacob thinks the ghosts killed him.  The women scream which scares Jacob some more, since for now he has no idea this is all an act.  In a moment that is NOT an act, Jacob stabs the guy in the biohazard suit when he feels his life is in danger.  Jacob stabs the dude right in the stomach and kills him!  The black friend with Jacob has blood dripping out of his mouth and wants to know how much longer he has to stay here.  The guy from the production team is like ""Meh, just stay there longer yo.  We'll scare Jacob good!""

The guy from the production crew says he has to stop this after Jacob kills that guy in the biohazard suit.  The TV production crew say ""How did we know Jacob was going to freak out like that!""  You'd think the production crew would say ""Okay, this is enough, we have to go tell Jacob this is all an act that went wrong so we can send the guy in the biohazard suit to the hospital"" but no!  Instead it's ""Wow Jacob kills a guy, caught onto us and now he has a hunger for more killings!  What do we do!""  Jacob dresses in the biohazard suit and takes an ax to his black friend.  He tries to crawl away but can't.  The TV crew figures out that Jacob knows he's on the show when he smashes the camera.

Jacob in his new biohazard suit chases after the one TV crew guy when he tries to stop him.  He barely gets through the door in time.  Meanwhile the two girls are still walking around in the dark.  They argue a bit.  One decides to end this but they get lost and can't find their way back to the main room with the TV crew.  One guy has a brain and tells his fellow employee he has  to call the police because Jacob's going crazy and chasing people around with an ax.  They determine they'll make a run for it if they have to.

The ladies find a dead body lying on the floor but they think it's an act.  They don't know what's going on yet.  The one girl kneels down and says she doesn't feel a pulse.  Just then Jacob sneaks around the corner and with tremendous force takes his ax and smacks the kneeling girl across the back with it.  The other frightened girl runs back to the TV crew's door but the guy says he can't risk the lives of everyone in the room over one girl so he won't let her in.  He hopes she's able to find that second entrance.  She does.  Jacob destroys another camera with his ax, and this makes it harder for the TV crew to spot him.  The frightened girl wonders if this is all part of the joke but the TV crew says Jacob just snapped and went crazy when he realized these people were trying to mess with him.

A man named Ed with a cooler pulls up outside.  The TV crew asks him to go get the police.  He thinks they're crazy.  The one guy swears they're trapped in here with a lunatic and if Ed comes in we'll all die.  Just then Jacob pulls the guy inside and chops off his arm with that ax.  The TV crew worries they'll run out of water.  The female employee thinks the network will get help but... Dave has an announcement.  The network doesn't know they're here.  He says not to worry since he thinks Jacob will get hungry or tired and have to leave.  Just then we see Jacob pull the cooler inside. Well maybe he'll get tired, lol.

The frightened woman thinks Jacob will kill them one by one because of their attempt to try and scare him.  They think of a plan to run outside and get the keys to the SUV, but they don't know where the keys are.  Another guy recommends running for help.  The female employee/girlfriend defends Dave from the TV crew criticisms by saying ""Hey, we were all okay with this show as long as we were getting a paycheck"".

The TV crew can see where Jacob's hiding and blocking the only way out.  Ed's alive!  Ed says if the TV crew opens the door Jacob will kill him, but he begs for them to open the door anyway.  When they refuse Jacob kills him.  They speculate that Jacob might have the volume on in the helmet he's wearing and can hear the conversations the TV crew are having.  They determine they're going to wait.  The second battery providing light to the room dies.  One more left.

The TV crew looks through maps to try and find a door that can help them escape.  They argue over who should go.  Two men leave quietly while looking at the map.  Suddenly Jacob jumps out from behind a wooden wall and attacks the one guy with an ax.  Someone turns off the lights afterwards, but luckily for us it's not too dark to see.  The second guy hides in a dark room and notifies the TV crew that he's close to an exit.  They see the man make it to the exit, open the door, almost to freedom!!!... when suddenly he disappears.  We then see his head fly through the exit!  Oh Jacob why!  Jacob shakes his finger into the camera signaling ""That was a naughty thing to do!""

The one TV crew man determines that since Jacob is busy back there they can escape through the front door.  The TV crew runs for it but there's a wooden board on the other side preventing the door from opening.  They run back to their room.  The one frightened girl mentions the watch she's wearing is her dad's and he died when she was 16.  She asks the crew how many times they pulled a prank like this.  The girl says 3 seasons, 22 episodes per season, 2 pranks per show.... 1 too many.

The one crew guy says the biggest problem he had this morning is finding out he made his pregnant girlfriend.  He didn't want the baby but the mother does.  The frightened girl says they'll die from dehydration before starvation.  The other girl sarcastically says the frightened girl is such an angel she never did anything wrong.  They have the camera evidence that the frightened girl only wanted her 15 minutes of fame and girls like her rejected Jacob and made him go crazy.  But uh, the whole crew went along with it so everyone's to blame!  The guy says he doesn't want to go out and get the map because he has a baby to think about, but the girl reminds him ""A baby you didn't want just a moment ago!""

The girl goes instead.  She walks down the dark hallway as the frightened girl and man watch from the camera room.  For us, this time it's too dark to see anything.  And if there's one time we don't need to withstand total darkness, it's during the key moment of the story as we approach the end!  Jacob hears the girl.  She runs when he finds her.  Jacob finally breaks into the TV crew room and kills the man who didn't want his baby by taking an ax to his face.  The frightened girl runs away.  Two girls left.  Jacob almost sees the frightened girl when he appears to glance into her room as she stands against a wall with the other girl close by, but somehow doesn't.

Just then Jacob cuts the frightened girl across the throat while holding hands with the other girl.  The other girl hides but Jacob pulls her out of her hiding spot.  He strangles her.  He reaches for his ax but it falls down, allowing the girl time to free herself, unlock the door and run.  But she struggles to find the right key!  Right when the door opens Jacob pulls her back in and... the end!  Awesome ending!  The good people don't always have to succeed now do they?  Then again they're the ones who picked on Jacob and made him this way, so how good can they be?

This movie's almost worthy of 4 stars believe it or not.  There's a little downtime at the end while Jacob wanders around doing nothing, and the story overall could have been a tad better in certain spots but otherwise I think it's pretty solid with decent suspense.  3.5 stars.  Oh and Jacob?  Okay maybe he *did* have some problems.  Anyone who acts like a typical enthusiastic young man eager to enter the abandoned chemical building then suddenly turns into a killer when he realizes these men and women are planning a prank has at least a little issues.  Just a little!",1501891200,,12076,4.292758773878276

8662869,3,B00KZJX8S2,"Not bad if you're looking for something to watch to kill some time.  There were many times the characters did things that made no sense whatsoever, and the foreshadowing for certain events was much to obvious - but that's the case with a lot of these types of movies.
