7964093,4,B0000687EM,This is a really good book on the little car; Mini Cooper. I think it has always been cool and this book is a good resource on that coolness.,1222992000,,141,3.896551724137931
7964094,3,B0000687EM,"Made right after the new Minis began coming off the assembly line, it does have some interesting background info on the history of the Mini, but spends a lot of time on Mini ""reunions."" We were more interested in the new model, which is writing its own history.",1167955200,2,261,4.458333333333333
7964095,2,B0000687EM,"I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend who's been interested in Mini Coopers ever since the original model came out. Mistake. There is information about the origins of the car. Portions show like stock footage from an AutoWeek show. Some shots are repeated in different portions of the DVD. Lots of time devoted to scan shots of different meets, especially the 40th Anniversary. ""Stunning selection of images and photos"" doesn't seem accurate. All things considered, the price is too steep for what's offerred.",1073174400,21,515,5.0
7964096,4,B0000687EM,"You know there's something up when this DVD is being featured along with the one for The Italian Job re-make. Let's see, which extended commercial for Minis is more entertaining? The one that is blatantly a commercial or the one that treads on movie ground we've seen before in a slick marketing ploy to move Minis?
Well, I gave the other one three stars!
(wasn't that evil guy in Austin Powers called ""mini: something or other?"" Is there a connection there, as well?)",1070841600,9,468,4.650602409638554
