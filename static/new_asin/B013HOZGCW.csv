7365597,5,B013HOZGCW,"How many times have you watched a movie in your favourite genre and thought ""Hey, I could do better than that!""  And yet, few of us ever do.

The creators of ""Chill: The Killing Games"" DID do that, and the results are a delight for horror fans of any age.  The basic plot is: Some friends decide to revive a role-playing game called ""Chill"", where the players draw roles from a box, and one of them is designated as the ""killer"" (think a live-action role-playing game for horror fans).  The goal is to survive the night without the ""killer"" getting you.  The game had been banned on the college campus where the film is set because of several REAL deaths that had happened the last time it had been played.  And, as you can imagine, someone decides to revive THAT part of things as well.

The cast is delightful... from veteran indie horror pro Roger Conners to relative newcomers Kelly Rogers, Angelia DeLuca and DJ Remark, they're all believable and compelling in their roles (I especially loved Kelly Roger's spooky goth and Jason Orr's narcissistic pretty-boy) .  Special credit goes to Director of Photography Noelle Bye... many indie horror films suffer from poor lighting and amateurish execution, but Bye's camera-work is professional and VERY effective, setting a mood that the script and cast deliver on in spades.

In an era where ""found-footage"" films bore us and zombies are more comical than scary, ""Chill"" is a wonderful homage to the 80's-era slasher films that so many of us grew up on.  Though clearly an homage, the story is original enough to keep even the most jaded horror fan interested.

This is THE film for your Halloween horror marathons this year... don't miss it!",1444694400,7,1692,4.760273972602739

7365599,2,B013HOZGCW,"Yes, the budget of this film was near zero. But that doesn't necessarily make a bad movie. It was poorly acted, but I've seen worse in multi million dollar movies. I think the main problem with the film is that it's not about anything. They spend the first half of the movie talking about this 'game' called chill. Well I never got what the game was. ""the next dungeon and dragons"" you can see in some newspaper clippings... What why? From what I understand, the only ""role playing"" part of the game is playing dead after you have been killed. That's stupid. There are even some dice in the cover of the movie. Why was that? Also, the killer makes no sense. Who's that again? What was the motivation? Also, it's pretty ridiculous there was no way out and Windows were indestructible. Such a large building and the killer always managed to find precisely who was being sought after. I never sensed any urgency or desire to escape from the victims. Were they as bored as I was? However, I do have to accept I saw the full movie. As boring and pointless as it was, at least it made me want to see the conclusion. That's why I give it two stars instead of 1. In the end, I think I did not hate it, just consider it worthless. I'm thankful it comes with the prime subscription. Having paid for it... now that would be the real tragedy",1473811200,,1329,4.341365461847389

7365604,4,B013HOZGCW,"Not a bad movie once it got going with the game remake.  The idea of the chill game is also a very real possibility.

7365608,5,B013HOZGCW,"If you're a fan of independent cinema you will more than likely really enjoy this film. The official IMDB states this was produced for under $8,000.00 which makes it all the more impressive! The camera work, lighting, locations, etc. all surpassed my expectations! The cast is diverse and some certainly read stronger than others, but the majority of the actors clearly have a steady grasp on the material and deliver their dialogue well. Stand-outs include Angelia DeLuca as the sarcastic and slightly embittered Madison and Kelly Rogers as the comedic and intentionally over-the-top Raven. Those girls steal every scene they're in and I hope to see more from them in the near future! The pacing is a bit slow at times but the story is constantly developing and there are even several moments of solid humor that gives this piece an ever more unique approach that helps it stand out against all of the other slasher out there right now!
The DVD itself is pretty simple and doesn't offer too much in the sense of bonus material that won't do much to excite the average viewer. The one exception to this is the large amount of cut-scenes included. There are several genuinely entertaining scenes that were omitted from the final cut of the film. It baffles me why they would have cut this solid material, but I suspect it would have to be attributed to the all-ready lengthy time-frame of the film. Adding in many more scenes would have brought this film close to 2 hours and, in the term of indies, that does seem a bit excessive!
Overall, a great story executed but a talented and clearly devoted crew who really look like they had a blast making this flick! If you're a lover of B horror, this movie is more than likely going to leave you pleasantly surprised!",1472860800,4,1762,4.687096774193549

7365611,1,B013HOZGCW,"Who in their right mind would rate this above one-star? The plot and so-called killer could be compared to a very low-budget ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" killer; the acting was horrible (you can see the dead make-up lady still breathing), and the killer over-exaggerates the motions when stabbing his victims which is totally unnecessary. I believe any sensible viewer comprehends what is going on even if they cannot see the victim at the time of the killing, i.e, Raven. The unknown, self-proclaimed, famous actor hammed it up way too much (all the actors/actresses must have volunteered) and the amount of blood, in some scenes, was way too much for the injury inflicted upon the victim. Then we find that there are three psychos instead of one. If this movie was available in Red Box I would seriously want my dollar back.",1472688000,,831,4.777777777777778

7365617,2,B013HOZGCW,"Cheesy. Only watched enough to make that determination, and just to put an ""FYI"" up. There at least was an actual PnP horror RPG called ""Chill"" of that era.

But, if you want a solid film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then make some popcorn, turn off the lights, buckle up, and enjoy the thrilling ride of this indie masterpiece.",1467331200,,542,4.776595744680851

7365621,4,B013HOZGCW,"I am a big fan of slasher movies. I grew up on the 80s slashers. Besides seeing the trailer, I wasn't positive what I would expect from Chill: The Killing Games. I was really surprised at how well this movie was. There are a few down points to the movie, that I will get to in a bit. I'm first going to start off with the positives.

Positives:
Acting - Three actors stood out to me. Roger Conners (Kyle), Brad Arner (Jared), and Angelia DeLuca (Maddison). All three of them were literally perfect for these roles. Brad played the douche-bag to perfection. I loved the interaction between Roger and Angelia. They showed real chemistry between them. I'm not taking anything away from any of the other actors. I enjoyed everyone's performances. Kelly Rogers (Raven), David Gilmore (Donnie), and Erinn Bakun (Kelly) were fantastic as well. I wish there was more scenes with Donnie and Kelly as well. Really great job to everyone involved.  Another great point for the acting. Each character was different. You didn't have similar characters in the movie. So it is very easy to get behind a character and root for them to survive at the end.

Story - 100% original. This is what you want with a horror movie, especially a slasher movie. Yes it does play the ""who done it"" role, which is typical now a days. But the story keeps you focused throughout and you never lose your interest.  The dialogue had some corny lines here and there. But there was some GREAT lines from Kyle, Roger, and Maddison throughout the entire movie. You also don't see the ending coming at all. That was a great surprise.

Special Effects - I'm not quite sure on the budget of the movie. Regardless what it was. The special effects were on point and not cheaply done. It is very easy to tell, that a lot of thought and effort was put into those scenes. Beautifully done.

Negatives -

Beginning of the movie - The first act of the movie is really slow. This isn't a bad negative. But I can see how some people could get turned off by the movie. A good majority of the first act, is only dialogue and builds the story up. The movie doesn't get going, until the game is about to be played. Then the pacing throughout moves really fast and you don't lose your focus.

Audio - It is very easy to tell there was some audio issues, especially during the indoor scenes. The audio isn't horrible, by any means. But you can tell there was some problems throughout. There was some times during the climax moments, that you couldn't understand the dialogue from the actors.

Even with those two negatives, Chill: The Killing Games is a well put together independent horror movie. I would really recommend this movie to any fan of the genre. You really do get everything you want in a horror movie. Great story, great actors, and fantastic gore.",1449014400,2,2805,4.549603174603175
7365622,3,B013HOZGCW,"Decent film. I think It was entertaining enough for people to see. It had decent f/x & some funny parts, with a better budget it could of been a lot better, with like any indie film, But chill was clever. I enjoyed it. I think these filmmakers have something you don't see often & that's heart, I look FWD to seeing more from these guys.",1446336000,2,337,4.2
7365623,5,B013HOZGCW,Suspenseful and wholly entertaining from beginning to end.  Roger Connors is a tour de force in this film!,1445212800,,106,4.888888888888889
7365624,5,B013HOZGCW,"A unique take on the urban legend slasher film, ""Chill"" delivers on everything from effective and creative camera work, great cinematography, an exciting, eclectic cast of indie actors, and a quirky script that weaves the right amount of humor in with the terror. In addition, the found footage truly does look ""found"" and it isn't overdone as it is in most found footage films over the last decade. This is a ""can't miss"" for anyone looking for an alternative to their horror movie repertoire!",1445126400,5,494,4.892857142857143

7365627,5,B013HOZGCW,"A few years ago I was treated to a rough edit of Chill: The Killing Games and still gave it an extremely positive review. Now that it is out for purchase, I was more than happy to purchase a copy of my own. And ya know what? I was entertained throughout my second viewing because Chill: The Killing Games has tremendous re-watchability. It has dry humor, mystery, gore, suspense, a cast that is attractive AND talented, It has moments when you'll cheer and moments when you'll be sad. At its core, the movie is a good ol' fashion murder mystery meets slasher film and one that is aimed towards the current generation of horror viewers.
