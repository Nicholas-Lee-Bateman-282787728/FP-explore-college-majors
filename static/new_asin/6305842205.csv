It was so classic and had my favorite ship of all time. The rest of the tape was fun as well. While not something I'd let small children watch.  Let's face it Happy isn't for anyone under 14.

 I found the tape to be a great buy for any fan of Ranma. A little short which is why I'm giving four stars. And the opening for this season isn't my favorite by a long shot.  However but it's way cheaper to buy the vhs than dvds. So for someone who can't shell out for the dvd set. or doesn't want too. This is just the ticket.  My copy came to me in wonderful shape.  While the box color was a little faded. The tape was perfect. Which is what counts.  This was a great buy for me.",1178928000,,828,3.8294117647058825

As you can imagine if you ever aeen any of these great shows before this is positively hilarious. If you  never have seen these before than may I suggest you start now. The second  episode is also hilarious. Kuno having troubles deciding whom he should love  as usual ends updeciding on nabiki.you have got to see this,it's great. The  first time I saw this video I laughed so hard I almost puked .Buy it now.",949881600,,529,4.36734693877551
