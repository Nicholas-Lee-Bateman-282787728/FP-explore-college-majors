8470718,2,B005FWEQYY,"The stage production and singers are reasonably good. I am a big fan of Luca Pisaroni although he is not at his best here.  The musical direction by Jes&uacute;s L&oacute;pez Cobos is poor to say the less. The overture lacks vigor and brightness and the orchestra goes, most of the times, behind the pace of the singers which is quite unbeareable to the ear.  There are tons of versions of this wonderful opera, some of them outstanding and some other quite bad.  This one lies on the mediocre side",1466208000,,498,4.573033707865169
8470719,3,B005FWEQYY,"The music is unquestionably beautiful because it was written by Mozart. However, the orchestra in this production was louder than the voices. This issue was caused by the sound engineer who should have made the proper corrections before releasing the Blu ray. Susana's vocal skills are fine but not great. She was too old for Figaro (age 38) and her acting was just so so. The sets were gorgeous and ample to perform a double wedding Figaro- Susana and Marcellina-Bartolo. Overall, the production had the potential to be excellent, but failed short. I don't usually compare artists, but it would be unfair to the production with Mia Persson as Susana and Ekaterina Siurina(Susana) and Luca Pisaroni (as Figaro). Both productions are available in blu ray format at amazon.",1411776000,2,771,5.03125
8470720,2,B005FWEQYY,"So far, I have purchased Marriage from Royal Opera House, Teatro Real de Madrid and Opera Australia. The singing and the orchestra in all were excellent. I have no problems there, but in the sets, dramatic actions, overture drama, and the non-verbal parts I encountered some major differences.

I was upset with the use of anachronistic set design with the Opera Australia, particularly the use of a floor hair dryer, red lounge chair, and electric iron, etc amid 17th century costuming and sets. This puts this version at the bottom of my list.

In the version from Madrid, I found the set design much better, especially hiding under the bed scene and the Spanish influence in the set design. However, I found a lack of dramatic non-verbal action in the faces/bodies of the main characters. It reminded me of a stand up singing of a pop star. I would place this version second on my list. I was pleased to see Barbara Fritoli whom I have not seen since the Met's Carmen.

The best version came from London. The non-verbal story during the Overture and the dissolving into the room which slowly glided onstage to allow the transition into the first act. The four plot lines (countess/count, Figaro/Susanna, Bartolo/Marcelina and the eves dropping servants) kept me glued to the story. In addition, all of the non-verbal facial expressions and body language gave depth to the story. In one sense, one could watch this version without the sound and still understand the storyline. One example, the scene at the beginning of the third act in which Susanna has refused the count's lustful advances (all displayed in his face and body language) when she suddenly says, ""Yes!"" and he jerks his head around with the surprised look on his face. This version was riddled with non-verbal action to further the plot lines. All the characters including the servants and the cleaning woman made this story a delight to watch over and over again, which I did.",1355788800,5,1945,4.817365269461078
8470721,3,B005FWEQYY,"I bought the Blu-ray disc based on all the five-star reviews posted here.  I, too, might have given it four or five stars, if it were not for the fact that I already own two other ""Marriage of Figaro"" and was able to make some comparisons.  I did not like this one for the following reasons:

(1) Barbara Frittoli as countess Almaviva.  I assume you all have watched at least one DVD of Rossini's The Barber of Sevilla.  Remember how clever and vivacious Rosina was then; marriage, apparently, turned her into a simpering, silly grown up.  Compare her with the countesses of Hillevi Martinpelto (Archiv Production, John Elio Gardiner) and Dorothea Rschmann:  they are ""the real thing"", loving wives who suffer from their husband's infidelities. (I also saw Barbara Frittoli as Micaela in Carmen, with Alagna as Don Jose; she did not seem too bright in that role either.)

(2) Ludovic Tzier as count Almaviva.  Two stars only (being generous) when compared with Gerald Finley and Rodney Gilfry.  Especially Rodney Gilfry: watching him, you understand right away why his wife loves him so much; he is no good, but so charming!  Tzier sings the role all right, but at no time does he ""become"" count Almaviva.

(3) Isabel Rey as Suzanna:  Blu-ray technology is very harsh for women, and Isabel Rey is obviously well past the age of playing Suzanna.  Not only does the picture reveal every crease in her face and neck, it also shows that her breasts are propped up with some high-tech bra that cannot, however, conceal the fact that they are sagging (especially in Acts 4 and 5).  This is something the costume designer could have easily prevented by giving her a dress with a higher neckline (like Marcellina's).

(4) The staging:  too ""busy"" for my taste.  The stage director, Emilio Sagi, has added a number of women who do nothing but eavesdrop, sometimes while cleaning the floors and windows.  Plus, at one point, in the background, you see Cherubino chasing Barbarina.  These are gratuitous additions to the libretto (McVicar does the same thing in Massenet's Manon); it is distracting and I find it unpleasant.

In brief, if you want a really good Marriage of Figaro, I would recommend one of these two:

- The 1993 version from Le Chtelet in Paris (John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir with Bryn Terfel, Rodney Gilfry, Hillevi Martinpelto, and Alison Hagley -- a perfect Suzanna, including the right age).  The settings are ""minimalist"", but that is all Mozart's masterpiece needs.

- For the singing and acting only:  the Royal Opera House production (Opus Arte, with Miah Persson, Gerald Finley and Dorothea Rschmann).  For some reason, the stage director (David McVicar), or perhaps the costume designer (Tanya McCallin), updated it to around 1830, which does not make sense considering that the action takes place before the French Revolution.  If you can ignore that nonsense, this is a most enjoyable production.

There is a more recent production, from the Paris Opera, but it is also with Ludovic Tzier and Barbara Frittoli; I do not intend to buy it.",1354233600,4,3071,4.876447876447877
8470722,5,B005FWEQYY,"This is a traditional-modern production. Traditional in the sense that time and place are kept as Mozart and Da Ponte intended. It takes place in Seville (Spain) before the French Revolution.  It is modern because the sets are very fresh, sophisticated and not overwhelming.  The use of a front semi-transparent curtain, and the lighted background is very effective.
But of course, the most important ingredient is the music. Singers are up to the task with the music and active acting. The orchestra is just wonderful.  There are some few instances when seemed to me that the singer and the orchestra where not in perfect synchronization. Also, at some points, the orchestra volume masked some the voices. I assume it is a recording issue. In the theater it was probably different.
The plot is a critic on aristocracy of its time and can easily be boring or confusing to contemporary audiences. This production makes it alive, enjoyable and easy to follow. I watched the Blu-ray version, and it is just perfect. In fact, it would seem that the stage director had in mind that it will be filmed. Some of the video shots composition are very artistic and beautiful. My kudos to the camera director.
The extras are in Spanish (with subtitles), interesting but not too deep. For those that know the opera, it will not provide any new insights.
Overall, I highly recommend this Blu-ray. Enjoy Mozart at his best.",1349654400,3,1408,4.858333333333333
8470723,5,B005FWEQYY,"Have watched Amadeus many, many times. Finally sat down to watch this beautiful opera. It was magnificent. With our home theater to play it on, we were delighted.",1348272000,,162,4.821428571428571
8470724,5,B005FWEQYY,"This performance from 2009 is a new production of the opera by Emilio Sagi and is of the full non-cut version of the opera. This is important as it makes sure that the original balance of the composition as conceived by Mozart is retained with all characters fully drawn by the appropriate recitatives and arias. This desire for completeness was very important to Sagi and conductor Lopez Cobos as they individually explain in the accompanying bonus interview.

This approach extends to the staging which is not only generous in its sumptuousness but also manages to create a great sense of 3D. This is done through imaginative and frequent use of intermediate gauze curtaining beyond which relevant action continues supplementing that of the foreground. The fine costuming continues these themes of historically accurate and generous detailing.

In summary therefore it would be fair to state that this is a remarkably satisfying feast for the eyes and the senses in terms of staging.

Great attention has been brought to bear on the roles of all the characters seen on the stage at any one time and also wherever positioned both in terms of drama and stage depth. These roles never cease to act their parts fully in character even when not the prime focus of attention, thus giving a great boost to the continuing sense of reality. This was a prime aim of the director and in that he totally succeeds. He also has firmly established the various connections with Seville by underlining Mozart's inclusion of the Fandango which would have been known to both the Count and the Countess as well as Figaro. (See Rossini's Barber of Seville).

Musically this is a first rate production with characterful singing of accuracy delivered by everyone without exception. Tezier, as the Count, gives the most impressive performance I have ever seen from him largely because he is so fully inside the part that he is able to rise beyond the notes and is really able to communicate to those on stage throughout. He is ably supported by Barbara Frittoli as the Countess, now ten years older than when she gave a wonderful rendition of Mrs Ford, a Merry Wife of Windsor, in the Royal Opera's production of Verdi's Falstaff. At this point in the story she is just about the correct age to be believably paired with Tezier as his wife.

Luca Pisaroni is also outstanding as the rather nave, young Figaro partnered by Isabel Rey as Susanna, his new wife, and claimed by Jeannette Fischer as Marcellina, ultimately revealed as his long-lost mother. Both sing and act their parts with all the skill resulting from years of operatic experience. However, as the clarity of the excellent recording only makes too clear, both of these women are about the same age as each other and certainly much more advanced in years as the much younger groom/son they covet. This, in a production that aims at such veracity of detail, may seem a little odd to some while others will not consider it a matter of importance especially as their roles are otherwise so well done. All the other parts are taken and delivered with equal commitment and complete conviction, and I include the many non-singing roles.

The recording provides excellent DTS-HD sound as well as stereo and reveals the excellence of the orchestra and the many orchestral details so frequently brought out by Lopos Corbos under his exhilarating musical direction. The visual recording is in the same league with crisp and accurate camera work. Technically we seem to be moving into a new era of technical excellence as this is not the only such example that I have been fortunate enough to experience lately.

This outstanding issue must surely please a great number of people for a great deal of the time. In my opinion it would be less than just to award less than the full 5 stars, so well done Teatro Real for yet another fine recording on your new `own' label.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

A feast for the eyes, but.....
When listening with headphones I sometimes noticed a slight roar or humming. Of course it's not loud, but in quiet passages(recitatives e.g.) a bit annoying.
Anyone else who has noticed that? (U.K. review)

I have not tested this issue in that way but the Shostakovich 5 on EuroArts clearly picks up the air conditioning low rumble which is particularly distracting in all quiet passages - and there are many. I shall check this issue with headphones when I have the chance but my sub woofer goes down to 13hz and would normally detect this sort of problem.
Ian Giles

You can hear it best in the first two acts. Afterwards it gradually decreases.
Air conditioning, yes, it sounds plausible. The recording was made in July, at that time it can be pretty hot in Madrid. (U.K. review)",1341878400,7,4828,4.84
8470725,5,B005FWEQYY,"I've been collecting video versions of this work for 30 years, first on VHS, then on laserdisc, next on DVD, and finally on blu-ray.  There is certainly no lack of excellent versions of this work with superb casts, direction, sets and camerawork.  I was mainly seeking something as good as what I already have, but with more wide screen, 5.1 DTS sound and sharper image.  I wasn't prepared for this being as good as it is.  Yes, all principals are cute, animated, attractive and superb of voice, including an extremely charismatic Cherubino, lacking in several other, recent issues.  But what really stands out are the sets and lighting.

Taking advantage of the sharpness of blu-ray and the huge stage at Madrid, this allows for filmic, visuals of a quality I've rarely seen before.  In many scenes we are aware of, not just the foreground, but what is happening through windows, room dividers, in other rooms or garden areas of the manor.  It really has the feeling of a movie, but on stage in a live performance.  And the lighting!  Brilliant ""day"" light streaming through windows, reflected off back walls giving an overall luminosity and sparkle to the scenes.  Also, many directorial bits of added actions, almost acrobatic motions on the part of the principals.  Be prepared for a sonic and visual experience a quantum leap above anything else you may have seen on video, film or live!

Update - Cast is:
Luca Pisaroni as Figaro
Isabel Ray as Susanna
Marina Comparato as Cherubino
Ludovic Tezier as Count Almaviva
Barbara Frittoli as Countess Alaviva
