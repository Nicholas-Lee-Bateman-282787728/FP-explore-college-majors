Good stories plus they help everyone no matter what your age to learn for the first time or remember how to have good relations with others.

8368625,5,B002EZLOGS,"My son loves to watch movies (and I love to let him watch things that are ""good"" for him).  This one was absolutely wonderful.  He will watch the video over and over.  With messages about dependability, responsibility, goodwill, consideration, and obedience, I am more than willing to let him.  I have already recommended these videos to some friends for their little ones because the message is good, the cartoons are cute, and the kids love it!  As a mom, I can say that I love Auto-B-Good too (and so will you!).  Be sure to check them out!",1266796800,2,543,4.546391752577319
