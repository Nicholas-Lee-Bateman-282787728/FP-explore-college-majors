3414640,5,B0018BEG5K,"I have been ""firming"" for years and this is one of the better new releases to come from them.  I like Allison as an instructor, but she likes to incorporate ""dance-y"" type moves into her workouts and I have 2 left feet!  However, I found this workout easier to follow along than some of her previous ones.  I did feel the burn using the resistance loop, which was great for my legs.  I tried to use my normal 8lb. weights for the upper body parts of this workout and had to switch to my 5lb. ones instead, so start with your lighter weights the first time you do this workout.  I highly recommend this one!!!",1221436800,,608,4.252173913043478
3414641,5,B0018BEG5K,"Once again FIRM instructor Alison Davis did a great job of delivering a fun and effective workout.  I can't believe how quickly the 55+ minutes went by. She incorporated a lot of new and different cardio moves that we haven't seen in FIRM workouts before. The lower body workout using the loop is great as well, you can feel your muscles engaging immediately. She ends it with a good ab routine using a few new moves. I suggest previewing the workout once or twice before actually doing the workout.",1221091200,4,499,4.606741573033708
3414642,5,B0018BEG5K,"I just completed this workout for the first time and it is AWESOME!!  I started using The Firm in February and this is by far the best one yet!  The cardio sections were fun and almost felt a little like a dance class again.  Alison does a good job with cueing, so it is easy to pick up the footwork.  The band is a great tool for adding resistance for the lower body and abs.  The one caveat with this workout is that it would be hard to keep pace if you are not already familiar with some of the Firm's standard moves.  Dangerous Curves Ahead will be a great addition to my workout rotation!!",1220745600,3,594,4.121739130434783
3414643,5,B0018BEG5K,"The Firm have been impressing me lately.  I wasn't always a fan of theirs but their latest releases have been so good I am going back to them now and really enjoying them.  Alison is back and doing another terrific job with cuing and motivating you.  She's encouraging without being over the top and she lets you know what's up next in time to get it down.
This workout uses a mix of aerobics with toning and comes with a cool looped band.  The intervals are about 8 minutes each and keep your heart rate up and tone your muscles at the same time which to me, seems to be the best way to shape up quick.  There is also ab work done on the floor so it really does get to your entire body.  It is probably best suited for intermediate to advanced exercisers and even for me (intermediate-ish), it's challenging enough.  My legs were burning while doing the lower-body portion and that gives me encouragement to keep going because I know I'm doing some good.
I really enjoy this.  It's fun and fat burning and led so well.  It's a new favourite of mine and hope that The Firm will keep bringing out quality workouts like this.",1220572800,33,1123,4.3349282296650715

3414648,5,B0018BEG5K,"Love this workout! The firm always guarantees results within 10 workouts....I got results after 5 workouts. I like the fact that there are two express cardio/sculpt workouts that you can choose from instead of doing the full hour workout...the instructor is easy to follow....I will say that this is a tough workout but they do provide beginner moves...I needed a workout to help me lose my stubborn baby weight and this dvd did it....I weigh around 145-150lbs and my heart rate monitor said I burned close to 560 calories(doing the whole workout of course)  definitely seeing the weight go bye-bye

3414651,5,B0018BEG5K,"Don't let the cute title fool you... this is a serious workout!  Alison is one of my favorites because her cuing is always really good.  I like using the loop; however I used a lighter resistance loop.  (You can get them cheap on e-bay)  I felt it right away.  I also don't do as high impact as they are, but you can stick with Emily if you don't want the jarring.",1323129600,,364,4.070422535211268
3414652,3,B0018BEG5K,"I am a HUGE Firm follower. This is definitely not my favorite. There is lots of jumping. I am okay with the occassional jumps or leaps within the sessions. With this workout, it seems like every cardio session had jumping that I found to be a bit jarring. All that said, it will give you a good sweat. And I enjoy Allison immensely as an instructor. Her cues are clear and her energy is always at a perfect level.",1310774400,,413,4.2405063291139244
3414653,4,B0018BEG5K,"I like that this DVD comes with a resistance band instead of only using weights. However, as other reviewers have noted, I don't think the band is as stretchy as the ones they have in the DVD.
The 'four complete workouts' are just different combinations of the full length workout. Definitely a nice option if you want a shorter workout or are looking to just work a certain area.",1305244800,,380,4.521739130434782
3414654,4,B0018BEG5K,"This is a pretty good workout. As with all workouts, the more effort you put into it, the better the workout. It's more of a beginner to intermediate level, but does the job and gets most muscles. I suggest interspersing with other exercise activities in your weekly routine.",1304294400,,275,4.75
3414655,5,B0018BEG5K,"I love this dvd! It's 60 minutes that delivers such a great workout! The band adds such a different form of resistance, and you can really feel it working. The band the dvd comes with is awful, not gunna lie. But I bought a substitue because it's worth it.",1303171200,,256,4.244897959183674
3414656,5,B0018BEG5K,"I love all of The Firm workouts that are lead by Alison Davis-McLean.  She instructs and explains the moves with enough time to follow her before she completes the move.  This is one of the more exerting Firm videos.  It comes with the resistance band, which I liked working out with.  It's a different challenge then the routines that have you use free weights.  I work out five times a week, and this workout is great for intermediate exercisers.  If you're a beginner, I wouldn't get discouraged from any of the moves.  They're easy to pick up after viewing it a few times.  Great video!",1301616000,,590,4.552380952380952
3414657,3,B0018BEG5K,I felt a little constricted in this video... It is great for toning but not the best for cardio. For the price I got it for on amazon I can't complain to much about it. :),1299888000,,171,3.7777777777777777
3414658,4,B0018BEG5K,"I've only ever tried one of Allison's Firm Dvds, and I wasn't a fan of that one, so I wasn't sure about this. But it was under $3 on sale and had some good reviews, so I decided to risk it and went ahead and bought it. I think I'm glad I did. I like the length of the workout. The 35-40 min workouts have their place, but I like to work out for longer than that some days. Allison's instruction and cueing are very good. I found it to be a fairly challenging workout, especially when working with the loop. The steps were difficult for me to master the first time out, but that has been the case with other Firm workouts, and I've generally found that if I do it a few times, I'll get the steps down. All in all, a solid addition to my library.",1299715200,,744,4.0
3414659,2,B0018BEG5K,I'm a big fan of the firm videos but this one never get's played because the volume of the background music is barely louder than a whisper. If you don't mind working out without music buy it; otherwise steer clear.,1291680000,,215,4.4
3414660,3,B0018BEG5K,"I am a fan of The FIRM. I usually find most challenging and motivating.  I also like Allison Davis as an instructor.  Dangerous Curves Ahead is definitely a challenging workout because it has alot of jumping  and lunging. And the use of the band is also an extra challenge albeit uncomfortable at times.  I just found the warm up and the cool down movements odd and uncomfortable.  I didn't like the music.  Also after several months of using it at least once or twice a week the band broke which is an integral part of the toning segments.  And I can't find a way to replace it even through the FIRM website.  I do like that you can break the work out in to 3 smaller workouts.  I wish more of them did that.  The title is weird too.  So overall I give it a B-.  I feel like I had a good workout after I'm done, I just also feel annoyed with it too.",1289952000,2,850,4.084848484848485
3414661,1,B0018BEG5K,"I like The Firm and have several of their fitness workout videos -- 10 to 15 to be exact -- and their videos helped me to get in great shape; so The Firm workouts do work and will get you the results you want.  That is definitely NOT the case with this workout.  For a start, it is extremely repetitive, which is really really boring.  The workout just drags on and on it seems.  The aerobic moves are really wierd which is very hard on your knees and joints and ACL ligaments and achilles heel/calf muscles.  Trust me, if you've ever had one of these types of injuries, you don't want one again -- they are painful and take ages to heal.  Alison is an ok instructor and her cueing is ok but whoever choreographed this workout apparantly doesn't know anything about decent warm-ups, good variety (which is part of what keeps you motivated to do the workout again and again), and doesn't care about stupid moves that might create a painful injury).  I have another Firm workout where Alison is the instructor and it is also very repetitive -- maybe this instructor just prefers that type of workout but to me it's just plain boring.  Anyway, I'm in great shape -- I run, I bike, I swim and have a very active lifestyle.  I have been working out and competing for years and know which workouts are good and which ones aren't.  This one belongs in the latter category.  To recap: The aerobic moves are bizarre, the tempo is way too fast, it's highly repetitive and boring, and the moves will definitely get you an injury.  I think this workout should be called ""Dangerous Injuries Ahead""  because if you keep doing this workout, that's exactly what you will have.",1280448000,3,1660,4.493333333333333
3414662,4,B0018BEG5K,"I am not a huge fan of Alison Davis' workouts by The Firm.  However, I decided to give this workout a chance after watching a preview of it on another Firm DVD I owned, and based on the positive reviews it got here on Amazon.  I'm glad I did; overall, I enjoyed this workout because it provides some very good cardio conditioning, and uses the loop in an effective way, not in a ""we're trying to sell more DVDs so we decided to use this little gadget to suck in more money"" kind of way.  Here's the breakdown:

THE GOOD:

1) Like I said, the cardio intervals are VERY GOOD.  They feature some higher-impact cardio moves, but I love to jump around while working out, so I found the combinations fun and easier to do than most of Alison's workouts.  They really got my heart rate up, and were long enough to get the job done.  All moves are done in the ""add on"" style, and are repeated enough times so you can actually master them.  Others might find this repetition boring, but I find it refreshing.
2) There are two sculpting intervals--one for the lower body (1st) and one for the upper body (2nd).  The lower body sculpting interval uses the loop, and the exercises done with the loop were effective and easy to do.  For the upper body, you use light weights (I used 5 pounds), and, again, the exercises were simple and effective.
3) The ab section at the end using the loop was good; at first, you might think the loop isn't going to do much, but she adds on newer moves, and then you really feel how the loop adds a new dimension to your workout.  For example, she does side plank raises first, and then has you lift the top leg with the loop around your ankles. . tough!
3) Alison's cueing in this video, in my opinion, was MUCH better than in her other videos.  Not only did she tell you what move was coming, or whether or not she was starting a combo over from the top, but she also stated which leg you were starting on.  This last little cute helped me out immensely; I am not coordinated, and I need to be reminded what foot/leg to start on!  It made it much easier for me to master the moves.
4) Emily does modify the moves in this video, and it's always nice to have a modifier there in case my feet get all tripped up learning the moves.  However, I wouldn't say she was modifying for beginners. . .this video, it seems, is geared more towards the intermediate/advanced exerciser.
5) The workout is 55 minutes long, and I like that--it doesn't end too soon, so you feel like you got a great workout in.  I also love the fact that they broke up this workout into three smaller workouts--one that's just cardio, one that just includes the sculpting segments, and one for the ab/core.  This will be fabulous for days where you just want cardio and no sculpting, or vice-versa.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

1) The loop that comes with the workout is VERY inflexible; I started the workout with that loop (it's green), but found I just couldn't do some of the exercises with a good range of motion.  I'm sure it just needs to be stretched out, but, on the first try of this workout, I didn't want to be ""hampered"" by the very thing that's supposed to work me.  Since I also own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-FIRM-Cardio-To-Go-Kit/dp/B0014N005W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The FIRM Cardio-To-Go Kit</a>, I used the pink loop that came with that kit--it was MUCH more flexible (I had never used it before this workout, so it hadn't been stretched out).  I will eventually use the green one, but didn't want to start using this workout frustrated.
2) Someone new to The Firm and their ""add on"" style could be tripped up (literally!) with the fast pace of some of the combos. In the very last cardio section, it seemed like Alison was adding on moves at a much more rapid pace than in the previous sections, and some of the moves were a bit more dancey; I had the most trouble keeping up during this segment.

I was actually surprised at how much I liked this workout.  I wouldn't say it's for someone looking for serious weight training; the sculpting segments weren't that intense.  I would say the ""dangerous curves"" are going to come by burning off fat during the intense cardio segments!  If you want some good cardio and strength training together, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Get-Chisel-d/dp/B001D261TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Get Chisel'd</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firm-500-Calorie-Workout/dp/B001D261SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firm: 500 Calorie Workout</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michelle-Dozois-Your-Body-Breakthru-Your-Best-Body-Circuit-Includes-Free-Resistance-Band/dp/B000P1YNA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michelle Dozois: Your Body Breakthru - Your Best Body Circuit, Includes Free Resistance Band!</a>.  However, if you're like me, and alternate strength and cardio days, this workout is perfect for your cardio days (just use light weights for the upper body segment).

Edited to add:  The next day after doing this workout, my outer thighs were sore.  I didn't think using the band would be that intense, but apparently so--and I used the more flexible loop.  So, it's not just another fitness gadget--it was working some of my ""problem areas"" pretty good!",1275696000,,5398,5.1058020477815695
3414663,5,B0018BEG5K,"I got a FIRM dvd instructed by Alison a couple years ago and she is the only instructor I feel comfortable buying. She is a good instructor, does all the moves with you, and is not annoying. You might get a little lost the first time but don't give up because you will get it. Her workouts always get me going even if I'm tired, she makes you want to workout with her. I will continue to buy her dvds, I have four by her and she hasn't let me down yet.",1267142400,,452,3.9239130434782608
3414664,3,B0018BEG5K,"As other reviewers said, this is a great workout for intermediate levels and above.  There is more cardio than some of the other videos I have but it is good for days I want that.  However.... I have problems following the moves.  The instructor doesn't explain the moves at all and there is no time left to practice a move before moving on to the next one or adding to it.  I found myself having to choose between getting a workout at all or trying to follow the moves, so I chose the first and just did something random whenever I couldn't follow what was going on - which was a lot.  I usually need a move or two to switch from one sequence to the next, and if she only does it one on each side and moves onto the next, I have lost half the workout.

It is frustrating because I am not going to spend time just to learn the moves, I want a workout.  Otherwise this would be just at the right level for me.",1263772800,5,908,4.039106145251397
3414665,4,B0018BEG5K,"I like this video but it is challenging. Not my favorite yet but there is potential.  Well choreographed as all The Firm videos.  Alison is a great leader, excellent cueing.  Lower impact moves are demonstrated and just following those gives a great workout too.",1261180800,,262,4.909090909090909
3414666,3,B0018BEG5K,"I love the firm workouts and this is one of my favourites. But I wasn't too impressed with the resistance loop. Sure, it's free, but I noticed after doing the workout around 10 times that it was getting thin in a couple of places, and then eventually it snapped. I wasn't over-stretching it or doing anything more with it than what was instructed in the video. I'd prefer to pay a bit more for the set with a loop that lasts a bit longer! Now I have to go out and buy my own loop.",1246060800,,480,4.063157894736842
3414667,4,B0018BEG5K,"This DVD is broken into three parts. There is a sculpting part, a cardio part, and a part where the previous two are combined. It is quite obvious that they taped the longer combined segment then cut and pasted to make the other two parts. That being said, I really do like the cardio express part. I feel like I get a decent workout after my weight training. I do not like sculpting work as I do that with my weight training, so I have not tried that segment. I did try the long segment and found the band awkward. It would roll up and become uncomfortable. I would recommend the DVD though just for the express cardio option.",1245801600,2,627,4.277310924369748
3414668,5,B0018BEG5K,"Alison nailed this tape!  Good overall workout that you will definitely feel the next day.  She builds up to the moves, so there's something for every level.  The cardio segments really get your heart rate going and the sculpting sections are challenging.  The band really works your muscles in a different way and the moves are highly effective.  I really enjoy this workout and it's now in my normal rotation.  I use this tape to replace a gym workout.  Alison rocked with her cues, instruction and enthusiam!",1244419200,,511,4.804597701149425

3414670,4,B0018BEG5K,"I enjoyed this workout, especially the areas where the loop is used.  I found the cardio segments to be effective and found some new moves that I really enjoyed.  I definitely enjoy having this one in my DVD library.",1239235200,,216,4.512820512820513

The workout is ok, but there are so many jumps, bounces, and calf pumps, it gets old pretty fast. I don't think this is one of those DVDs I'll do over and over again. It's just a little too repetitive. Also, maybe it's just the copy I have (though it shouldn't be, I bought it new) but the video quality is terrible. I was stunned to read this was made in 2008.

I prefer to select which exercesis I am going to do rather than doing the whole DVD is very long although you get to swet, but still have good results. It is funny when the instructor says ""Listen"" very serious haha

I recommend this DVD if you like to work out hard.

3414674,3,B0018BEG5K,"Let me begin by stating that I am a HUGE fan of The Firm's new line of workout DVDs.  I find them addictively fun, energizing, challenging and they have left me with the sexiest body I've ever had and will ever have.  That being said, I found this particular title a little...lacking.
My 1st problem:  The production quality of this program is dismal!  I absolutely loved the original bright window set (seen in pretty much every early ""pink box"" DVD such as ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout,"" """"Slim & Sculpt Stability Ball Workout,""""Bootcamp: Max Calorie Burn,"" etc.). Very cheery and just pleasant.  It put me in a good mood!  The 2nd set (used in ""Cardio Core Fusion,"" Cardio Dance Fusion,"" ""Power Half Hour,"" etc.) is also nice with the ""Mediterranean-style"" view in the background.  Also gives me a little bit of escapism.  And then, for some reason, they changed to this set.
Ugh! It reminds me of a basement! Dark and depressing.  No light at all. The workout actors all seem to have dark circles and hollow cheeks just because of the horrible lighting.  Furthermore, the music is barely audible, but the sound of feet hitting the floor is VERY audible. For me, one of the components that make a great workout is good, energizing music, and the fact that it is so low here is a shame, b/c if I turn my TV up VERY loud, I can  (barely) hear that it is a decent soundtrack.
Now on to the workout itself.  Like most Firm workouts, it alternates cardio with sculpting in a cycle. This particular workout is about an hour, and has 3 cardio segments interspersed with 3 sculpting segments. However, the sculpting segments are not the traditional 4-limb variety that has made The Firm so effective.  There is lower body toning (using a resistance loop that comes with the DVD), then upper body toning (using one pair of dumbbells), then abs sculpting (again using the resistance loop).  Now, I LOVED using the loop.  One (slight, for me) problem: The loop that is used in the DVD is NOT the same as the one you are given. The loop Alison and crew utilize obviously has more give and is able to be stretched further. Yours will (at least initially) hardly stretch at all. As a result, you may become frustrated when you cannot do a move as large/wide as you are supposed to (i.e. they will lift their leg knee level and you won't be able to get yours 2 inches off the ground!). However, I really enjoy fitness tools and was happy to find a different way to tone my body other than the usual (though very effective) methods. So what if I can't stretch it that far?  I still enjoy using it! However, because you are only sculpting one part of your body at a time, it is not nearly as intense. I found my heart rate lowered considerably during these sculpting sections.
The cardio is very high impact with lots of hopping and a little bit of plyo jumping. As far as intensity goes, however, the only truly intense segment (in my opinion) is the 2nd one.  It goes from hamstring curls with a hop, to a Nordi-Track-like ski move that kicks my rear!  Then there's that side-to-side ski move...I get pretty winded!  And then my heart comes back down again with the last cardio, which is fun but not terribly challenging.
When all is said and done, I actually get the most use out of this title by using one of the express workout options in combination with another half hour workout DVD. For example, I do the Dangerous Curves Ahead Express Sculpt right after The Firm's Power Half Hour and I sweat and burn a TON! Or I do DCA Express Cardio right before another half hour toning DVD and again, I sweat a TON! But if I do this full workout as is, it's just not challenging enough. No real burn there!
So in the end, DCA is not perfect, far from it, but the loop, for me, makes it worth it.  Something a little different!  If you would like to see a clip of this, check out The Firm's site.",1235347200,10,3880,4.451977401129944
3414675,5,B0018BEG5K,"This DVD really gets your heart going. It's fun and is a nice change from my old Firm workout DVD's. The loop is not the same as the one that they use in the DVD. It's doesn't have a lot of give, but you still can do the moves.",1233619200,,227,3.6530612244897958
3414676,4,B0018BEG5K,"I won't lie: This work out was difficult to figure out the first couple times I used it. However, by the third time I began to master most of the footwork. Now that I have mastered the footwork I find this work out to be fun and exceptionally effective. That said, if this work out has a weak point it would have to be the sculpting segments that employ the use of the band and light weights. It just does not do a lot for me. However, I do believe that the cardio and strength training segments blend well together. Nonetheless, I do believe interval training, which is essentially what this is, is highly effective. I also believe that everybody needs at least two days of intense strength training a week. For that I prefer Jari Love's ""Ripped & Chiseled"". If you are looking for a well-rounded work out then this one is the one for you, especially if you are intermediate or advanced.",1232496000,2,888,4.420731707317073
3414677,5,B0018BEG5K,"I've had other Gaiam products, and although their quality is really great, their cardio dvds are usually too intense for me. Somehow, I have been able to do entire 30-minute workouts with this dvd. It is REALLY a great dvd. The short (25-35 minute) workouts are broken into 5-10 minute segments, so it is very easy to pause for a quick water break! The band it comes with is also great and effective. The dance-like routines that are incorporated in this dvd can be confusing at first, but after a few tries it's easy to follow.

I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is looking for an exciting dvd that will make you WANT to exercise, and anyone who is looking for an exercise dvd in order to lose some lbs!",1231891200,,711,4.386363636363637

I've tried this one about 6-7 times and find it extremely frustrating due to all the fancy footwork.  The instructor changes the moves quickly too, and doesn't explain the move, just jumps into it - both arms and legs. She has some fancy terms for her moves, and if you're a dancer, they may be familiar.  I never took dance other than ballroom, so perhaps that is why I cannot figure them out.  Too bad there is not a tutorial on all the dance moves as a bonus feature, because the workout moves are way too fast to learn them.  I never thought of myself as uncoordinated until I got this DVD.  I wanted to get a workout, but I feel like half the time I need to run in place because she loses me - NOT because I am not fit enough. I don't recommend this video to people unless they are trained dancers.",1231891200,6,933,4.121546961325967

3414682,4,B0018BEG5K,"This is a total body workout with one 55 min workout, and three separate express segments; one for cardio, one for sculpting, and one that is cardio-abs. 145 minutes total, and I got a band! I really enjoyed doing this workout.  I have been a FIRM junkie for 10 years now, have done everything from Susan Harris and Traci Long videos to the newest Transfirmation system. This one falls somewhere towards the top of my ratings.
What I liked:
This is another video with Allison Davis-McLain as the lead. She is very motivating. I thought that Emily did a great job as the ""modifier."" There were a couple of new faces too that were energetic. Time did seem to cruise on by, I sweated, and my ab muscles ached the next day, which is always a good sign to me.
What I didn't like:
This video contained a lot of calf-pump type jumping exercises, which for me, is a killer on my knees and my calfs (Duh, right?). There was also something Allison called the ""lunge plyo"" where I was supposed to go into lunge position jumping when I switched legs. I didn't attempt to do that one.. looked kind of scary to me. I also didn't like that Allison would say every once in awhile ""Now listen!"" I don't like being talked down to in an exercise video; I kind of felt like I was in kindergarten when she did that.
All in all, a lot of fun, and a lot of bang for my buck.",1227052800,17,1351,4.256809338521401
3414683,5,B0018BEG5K,I bought this dvd to try a different type of aerobic exircise.. I used Richard Simmons tapes after having my son.. but while they helped me lose weight.. it was low impact and I didn't always feel the burn.. and I didn't always sweat.. I've had this video for a week.. and I've done it three times so far (i work weekends so I limit it to 4 times a week..).. and let me tell you.. sweat pours off of me and I'm not one that sweats easily.. I love this work out.. The moves are hard..but after a few times I've got them down pretty well.. i'm not trying to lose a lot of weight (I'm 130) I want it to help maintain my curves and sculpt my muscles.. and I feel the burn with this one... with the full workout I really feel I get a good high impact cardo workout and tone.. since the toning is inbetween the cardio segments.. i feel liek my muscles are working that much harder.. I highly reccomend this video.. I think its fun.. and fullfilling,1225843200,,942,4.125

They actually had new moves to do!  The DVD comes with a band.  It's not that impressive, but it does give a bit of a break from weights.

3414685,5,B0018BEG5K,"This is Allisons best yet.  I loved her boot camp training for it's intensity, and her cardio overdrive for it's easy and super fun segments.

I have been with The Firm for 10 years and Allison has just made a great addition to the team!!!!I look forward to trying the new Firm Wave!!",1225584000,,341,4.467741935483871
3414686,5,B0018BEG5K,"I buy everything The Firm puts out, and for the longest time, I couldn't imagine a Firm workout without thinking of ""three sets of dumbbells, light, medium, and heavy"" and some kind of step.  Dangerous Curves Ahead is a departure from this formula.  The aerobic work is all done on the floor, and you use just one pair of light-ish dumbbells, plus the ""resistance loop.""  (The exercisers in this workout use The Firm's Cardio Weights, so if you already have these, you can choose how heavy you make your weights.  If not, you can use dumbbells you already own.  I use 5 pounds for this workout.)

I was surprised at how effective this workout is.  I exercise 5-7 days a week, an hour at a time.  The footwork is fairly easy to pick up, especially if you're kind of used to Alison Davis' choreography.  There are a couple spots during the full workout where the cueing is a little off, but once you do the workout a few times, you'll know it well enough to know what's coming up.  The work you'll do with your dumbbells is fairly predictable and mostly 4-limb.  There's some good focus on triceps in this one.  The Resistance Loop must be a little more intense than the one Alison and Company use, because I've been at exercising for a while, and I found myself following Emily's ""beginner"" modification during the side-plank series.  But if the Resistance Loop is a little too tight for you to begin with, you could probably make your own by looping a Dyna Band so you'd have more stretch, then work your way up to the Resistance Loop that comes with this workout.

What I particularly like about Dangerous Curves Ahead is that you're able to tailor this workout to the length of workout you have time for and to the kind of workout you want to do on a given day: cardio, sculpt/tone, or the whole 55-minute workout.  It isn't really geared for beginners, but it's definitely something you can modify (don't use the band or dumbbells, make the cardio moves less intense), and grow into.",1225238400,6,1986,4.53932584269663
3414687,5,B0018BEG5K,This is another firm workout I ordered when I got the firm kettle bell and exercise dvd.  I really enjoy the use of the  band and weights combined.

3414688,4,B0018BEG5K,"Let me start by saying that I really like Allison's workouts - her cueing is always very precise and she is, in my opinion, a very likeable and motivating instructor.
However, I have a bit of a problem with the cardio section of this particular routine. I have to be quite careful when it comes to high impact moves and this workout has a lot of those. If I follow Allison and do all of them I can feel my knees acting up but I get a decent workout. If I follow the modifications shown my knees are safe but I burn only 100-150 kcal on average, which is not too good for 55 min spent exercising. I can only hope it will get better or that I'll come up with some better ways of modifying the moves.
Otherwise it is a very good workout, I really liked the sculpting section with the ( provided ) band. 55 mins go by without you noticing it, but if you don't have time you can choose one of the premixed shorter workouts. Great idea!",1224201600,4,930,4.115384615384615
3414689,4,B0018BEG5K,"This workout really burns calories!  The cardio has some fun, unique moves I really enjoy.  The problem I have with it is that the performers other than Alison aren't very nice to watch.  One seems to have a deformity of her belly and it is very distracting and unpleasant.  One of the performers looks like a skeleton with hair and the other two are chubby.  I like to watch performers who look like they have improved their bodies by doing the workout - that helps motivate me.  Watching these women is very discouraging.",1222473600,2,523,4.56989247311828

I am now a SOLID BAND excersier! I hope the Firm makes more workouts using this band! GREAT DEAL! You can do a full 55 min workout-or do just cardio-or just the toning segments! FUN! I even use the band to tone my inner thighs, and legs even when I'm not using this dvd!! You can even fit the band in your purse and take it to work!!!! My only complaint on this workout is that I wish the toning parts (using the green band) were a little longer, and I hope and pray they make tons of more Firm workouts using the little ""green guy"". Alison is PERFECT when it comes to cueing. Her soft tone voice always puts you at ease-and she is motivating! If you do want a longer leg workout-I do the toning part of the lower body-then rewind and do it 2 or 3 times for extra toning too! Absolutly genious what they've done with this workout! A SOLID A++++++++++!!

The only negative to this workout is that I believe the band wasn't used enough and the cardio segments were too repetitive and boring after a few minutes.",1221696000,3,1154,4.245454545454545

The 55 minutes passed very quickly and for occasions when I don't have that amount of time, there are 3 express workout options.  Alison's cueing is supurb and she generally stays in tempo.  When the resistance band is utilized, she allows adequate time for the band to be properly placed.  Although there are the usual ""beginner modifications,"" they generally are not referred to this way and I think that's a big hint that this is not quite the place for beginners to start.  (Speaking of which, the only downside of the entire workout is that Alison gets a little bossy with Emily, who is performing the modifications.)  The cardio portions are very challenging, even when one opts out of the plyometric power options available.  The resistance portions are excellent as well.
