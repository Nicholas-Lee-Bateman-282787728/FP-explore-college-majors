5315123,5,B009C30ROU,"The growing relationship between Hank and his driver, Silas was fantastic.  The acting was believable, and the story just pulled you along.  I have already watched it three times, and I am getting ready for the fourth in a few minutes.  Then, I'll probably watch Walk the Line, the The Last Ride again.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie for ALL country music fans, fans of the South in the 1950s, and real movie fans.  Tim Jackson and Harry Thomason, you've really done it this time.  Thanks!  More, please!",1370304000,20,504,4.659090909090909
5315124,5,B009C30ROU,"A Really Great Movie,I attended the Premiere at the Keith-Albee Theater in Huntington,WV (February, 2012). Was impressed!  Tony Ramey wrote and performed the title song (The Last Ride)at this Premiere show. What a talent! You can download this song and purchase his cds online at TonyRameyMusic.com. The song is beautiful and has a lot of meaning, very inspirational and moving as is all of his music.",1366934400,4,401,5.075757575757576

5315134,2,B009C30ROU,"The big star of this film was the beautiful 1952 baby blue Cadillac convertible. Nice photography. Everything else was ho-hum. I was hoping it would be much better. Too much fiction. Not enough Hank Williams songs sung in the Hank Williams manner. Not a good representation of Hank. The best part was the photographs at the end with Johnny Cash singing ""The Night Hank Williams Came to Town"".",1493856000,,392,4.779411764705882

5315136,3,B009C30ROU,"This movie covers the last few days of his life. Entertaining but don't expect much singing. Most of this is speculative and not based on actual events.

Excellent  recreation of that era.
Great actors ,  no one over does it,
I think  it was very well detailed,  very subtle beauty in the film.
The Johnny Cash song at the end

 ""The Night Hank Williams came to Town""
Very well done film... I'm from Lake Ozark MO
as was one of the producers...

Saw ""127-Rose avenue"" this Year

5315152,3,B009C30ROU,Great acting in a very disappointing interpretation. The mood of time frame in the film is the only positive aspect of the film. The screen play is pathetic. Where ideas for the events depicted came from are beyond comprehension. The Great Gatsby of the late '60s is the closest disaster I can recall. Brilliant cast with a deplorable sceen play.,1478304000,,346,4.783333333333333

5315166,1,B009C30ROU,"No! The singing wasn't too good, nothing like Hank. Maybe should of played more of his music... I didn't hear much of his music at all!  The only thing I liked was the old cars, . Even my 88 year old dad hated it, sorry but it's the truth.",1466812800,2,239,3.877551020408163

5315168,2,B009C30ROU,"I've never made a movie, but I can empathize with the time, effort and resources involved. With that said, it seems to me a few things could have been tweaked in this film. First of all, Jesse James looks nothing like Hank, nor captures any of his mannerisms. And what's up with him not being referred to as ""Hank""?  There is little chemistry between James and Henry Thomas. The script/dialogue is bland and there's nothing funny exchanged between them, no ""life lessons"" passed on, no discussion of music, no tension, just riding in the car with a few stops. It's apparent this was produced on a budget. Check out the ""snow,"" as well as the obviously fake airplane ride that adds nothing to the story (did that even actually happen - those of you who saw the movie know what I'm talking about). I did enjoy seeing the vintage cars, though if you look closely you'll notice they're spotless. I guess the owners didn't want any authentic dirt and road grime on their babies. This production did little to engage me except make me curious about the real event, which you can read about in more detail.",1465430400,,1099,4.5786802030456855
5315169,3,B009C30ROU,"Had never heard about the fight outside the roadhouse.  The film was interesting, and I did not know he had been born with spinal bifida (sp).  I did do some research to confirm his medical condition.  It needed some direction, I would not watch it a second time.  Something was missing.",1465257600,,287,4.568627450980392
5315170,5,B009C30ROU,The Last Ride is very interesting.  Enjoyed the characters and the story.,1464393600,,73,5.083333333333333

5315183,5,B009C30ROU,This was a great movie if you love Classic Country. The story takes place over a period of the day or two that it takes a young man to drive Hank Williams to a New Year's Eve engagement. It's literally Williams' last ride. The film is interesting visually and the soundtrack is chock full of good country music. I watched it on Amazon with my prime subscription and then bought a copy to send as a gift.,1456185600,,403,4.246753246753247

5315187,3,B009C30ROU,"I believe there was an honest effort to try and capture the essence of the real Hank Williams while he was dealing with what would become his Last Ride indeed.  In all respects this was a sad and untimely end to a brilliant song writing legend, but he was so much more than that to his family, friends, and fans.  He was after all human, and loved with all his faults.  That love remains to this day.  This movie portrayed a man we might not like if this was all we knew of him, but since he was loved by so many, and for as many reasons, his story will always be a hard one to tell, or get right.  If anyone did, how would we know?  I was curious how his passing, and most notable; evidence of a beating shortly before would be explained.  This version seems plausible, at least an attack was acknowledged.  I was a little disappointed in how Hank was portrayed throughout the movie.  While he was the catalyst for the movie, the real story was about the driver, and ultimately a girl.  But in the end, perhaps it's just my perception as a fan that was off.  I watched it once, but probably will not again.",1453420800,4,1107,4.199052132701421
5315188,5,B009C30ROU,Anything Hank related is up my alley.  While not a look at Hank Sr's complete life it's an interesting look into the 3 days preceeding his death.,1452988800,,145,4.37037037037037

5315193,5,B009C30ROU,"This was a story about Hank Williams manager hiring a young man to drive him to some winter dates with the responsibility of keeping Hank on time and sober.
The attention made to detail regarding our country during this time was very accurate in home things were represented.
A much simpler time in some perspectives but decisions and actions were often much more consequential than they are today.  This Harry Thomason work followed the honesty I have found in all of his work.  You can smell the motor oil, the leather seats and the whiskey spilt in the floorboard.  Great story that anyone who lived in middle America over the past 50 - 70 years can relate to what transpires on the screen.",1449964800,,693,4.617886178861789

5315195,5,B009C30ROU,This movie surprised me. I had heard good things about the movie but after watching it I found it to be even better than what I had been told. The casting was perfect and the story line was excellent. I enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end. Well done by all involved.,1449964800,,279,4.185185185185185
5315196,5,B009C30ROU,"How daring of a director to not only do a film about a fifties icon but to direct and cut it at a pace perfectly matched to the fifties. It must have taken great discipline to hold the course and not fall to the temptation to cut it at the sophomoric pace of most present day movies and surrender the ambiance and feelings of it 1950's roots.  You actually felt you had been transported back to the days before TV and the Internet in this one.  Kudos to the director and actors.  I can't leave out the fact that the set design was spot on correct and the music was a pure evocation of the state of music in the fifties. It was a realistic ""back to the past"" experience!",1449964800,,669,4.130769230769231

5315207,2,B009C30ROU,"Hubby and I did not like this movie much at all. We love music and road stories and are Hank (& even Henry Thomas and Kaley Cuoco) fans, but found ourselves aggravated at the lack of good music and good acting in the film. The production value was comically awful and the writing was elementary. The bonus features were equally terrible, both in content and production - seriously, I've seen better video shot on a phone. I can't believe this movie has such high reviews from others - it was so bad. We'd give it 1.5 stars if we could, just cause there was SOME music in it. Shame.",1442016000,,581,4.339449541284404

5315209,3,B009C30ROU,"Ok if you are a die hard Hank fan and can take anything they throw down the pike, just a big shame that the cast a Yankee kind of guy to play old Hank when we got plenty of good ol boys we could of used.  Hank III looks and sounds like his granddad, they could of gone a bit more into it, but Id watch an etch a sketch about Hank if that's all there was.  So I liked it, but why make up the hokey stuff that Hank gave him the car, Hank JR drove that car in high school, he did not give that away.  Plus all the music is like a city version of country music, all the Hank sounds sound like they are sung by Tony Bennet.",1440979200,,618,3.6666666666666665

His wife just bought a computer and he is a bit tech challenged, so I thought that he would like to have something that he
could watch on the computer. He had hinted a few times that he loved Hank Williams and his name being Hank too, this would
be a great little gift. It would also nudge him to use that new computer.

5315239,4,B009C30ROU,"there's much not right here. & most of y'all know this. i don't believe it calls for a rehash from me.
i liked it. i liked it a lot.

that said, the definitive hank williams sr. flick will not see the light of day without hank williams 3 in it, as he is his grandpa's reincarnation in all the good & some of the bad ways. this is my formal proclamation &/or protest.

this is perhaps the most iconic & tragic ""road trip"" ever. the film is infused with a sense of foreboding that's more than just based on the fact we Know it ain't gonna end well.
great soundtrack, though williams doesn't sing a note on it. the tunes were chosen & presented well, providing a rich sense of time & place.
dialogue, wardrobe, accents, attitudes, the cars(!), settings, & a clear part of poor hank's spirit all seem natural & genuine....

i ain't ashamed of neither.

Most reviewers wanted a different movie (If it's about Hank Williams, why isn't he singing?). I loved its evocation of the landscape and people of my childhood (one reviewer thought it was full of southern stereotypes; I guess one person's realism can be another person's stereotype--but I bet this reviewer was NOT southern). I saw it as a friend's movie rental and liked it so much that I bought it. The reviews described it as an indie movie that had limited distribution.

5315262,1,B009C30ROU,"I chose this rating for many reasons with the most dominant being that the acting and plot were terrible. If you had no idea who Hank Williams was and picked this film for pure entertainment you would be grossly disappointed. And you would probably have no better appreciation for who the man was because it's not really revealed in the story. If you *did* know who he was you would learn, like I, that the use of his character is merely a ploy to get fans to watch it by using his name in the title. It tells nothing of what his career or life were really like. It just describes his last days alive. And this might be fictitious.

The young driver new Williams all his life.  They were friendly and got along famously as a couple of young guys on a road trip would and people along the way would have recognized him!!!  Oh and how about some music by Hank Williams himself - wow that might have helped!

The actual driver was Charles Carr, a first-year college student, who was driving Mr. Hank Williams to the concerts he needed to attend. Hank Williams was already ill and the cold weather didn't help either. Hank Williams was drinking whiskey and was given a B-12 shots and morphine. Hank became so weak, he had to be carried out by the porters to the car from a hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee. On January 1, 1953 as Carr had been driving and was now in Oak Hill, West Virginia, he found Hank Williams had passed away in the back seat of the car in the same position as he was put in the car earlier. Hank Williams was only 29.
  Charles Carr continued living in Montgomery, Alabama where is worked in investment and real estate until he retired. He passed away in July 2013 at the age of 79.

5315304,4,B009C30ROU,"Live fast, die young, and make a good corpse is a mantra that Hank Williams' who last ride before his premature death is the subject of the film under review, ah, called The Last Ride,  lived by. Every generation, every niche cultural enclave has its iconic wild boys (thus far mainly wild boys, although if things even out the wild women, wild women in my sense, should not be far behind) who stirred the imagination, who made their devotees believe, believe that the moment had to be seized and shaken for what it was worth. Names like John Reed, Hemingway, the young Marlon Brando, James Dean, Jack Keroauc (and his mad band of associates, Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and William Burroughs), Jim Morrison of The Doors, Hunter Thompson and so on. Not all of them died young as Hank William did, although not for not trying, but they all listened to their own drummer and left a cultural marker on the planet.

Of course Hank's niche was new style (then new style -okay) country music that shifted the beat from slow mournful old timey Jimmy Rodgers back road and Carter Family mountain-etched music to more contemporary and personal concerns with a jump band as back up. My connection, my tenuous and rebellious connection, to Hank's kind of music was hearing it waft through my growing up in the late1950s house in Hullsville south of Boston when my father, a son of Appalachia, would play or listen to old Hank and companions. I, a child of rock and roll insistent in listening  my own drummer, took a long time, a very long time to learn to appreciate Hank beyond my father's hard rock-etched  dreams.

All this above as prelude to the simple fact that as a late-comer I was not privy to a lot of Hank Williams' life story and so rather let his music speak for him. So I was not aware until viewing this film about the manner of his death, although I had an inkling from reading liner notes on some of his CDs that he was another in that short line of wild boys who had to keep moving, had to keep pushing the envelope, had to live out there on edge city where the wild boys need to hang out.

So the plot here is not what drives this film, hell, the title says it all, it's a cinematic recreation of Hank's last ride but what drive it is the bonding between an essentially lonely, sick man (at only 29 so you know he sowed some serious wild oats) and the last man who saw him alive, his young hired for the ocassion of getting him to his next concert chauffer. What drives this thing is the interplay between the two, between the country boy chauffer's coming of age and Hank's tumble into that die young good night. Most of the interchange done inside that big old Caddy that was a symbol that one had arrived in the big time in America. And that simple plot interplay worked whatever the cinematic licenses were taken about the actual facts of Brother Williams' death. But see dying young for some guys (or gals) is only prelude, some sixty years later his songs like Cold ,Cold Heart that I heard like I said almost from the cradle still sound fresh. And the soundtrack here has some very good material acting as backdrop as Hank moves to that last long lonely ride.",1376956800,,3191,4.455479452054795

Since there is much driving there are several cars, they are in a 1950's Caddy, it is a character itself.  Fred Thompson plays Wells' manager during some phone calls.

When they do not make the show in Virginia they head to Ohio, two times they get fuel for $6 and $8.  Kaley Cuoco appears in the Third Act as a local love interest.

This is not a fast-paced action film, but the actors did a good job and held my attention well.  I found myself drawn to the driver.

5315330,4,B009C30ROU,"I admit that I'm not an expert on Hank Williams though I think I've reviewed every reissue of his music over the last 15 years and I got the soundtrack CD earlier this year. I missed the film when it played in theaters and was anxious to see it on DVD/BD.  Overall I liked it, but don't expect ""Oscar"" winning performances. It was pretty much independently produced in 2010 but didn't get a distributor (Fox) until 2012. And it took till this year (2013) to get to home video.

You'll hear a lot about Hank Williams in the review but not hear his name mentioned in the film - except on the radio. Even the intro refers to ""Luke the Drifter"", Williams ""alter-ego"". And the screen says ""Based on a true story"" at the beginning but in the bonus feature (more on that in a minute) they say that most of it is fiction. I don't think I'm giving anything away ( I hate spoilers too) by saying that ""Luke"" dies in the back of his Cadillac, and that is true. Whether anyone else was inside is not known for certain.

The film features lots of music including alol Hank Williams' hits as well as new songs performed by a band, whose members I didn't recognize. Of the musicians on the score, I did recognize one name, Jimmy Capps, who is a regular on Larry Black's ""Country's Family Reunion"" TV show. So country and Hank fans will enjoy this.
Hank/Luke is played by Henry Thomas - who has certainly grown since he starred in ""E.T.""! I think he overdoes the ""drunken""  thing but not enough to dissuade folks from seeing this. If you spot Kaley Cuoco's name on the package and lover her - as I do - from The Big Bang Theory, you will find that she doesn't appear until 2/3 of the way through the film and doesn't get a lot of screen time. So don't come here expecting a lot of Kaley.

The sole bonus - at least on the Bluray-  is a 6 minute  featurette "" A  Look Inside The Last Ride"", which contains interviews from three of the cast members but not the Director or Screenwriter. I'm not sure it added much. And, unlike the film which is in widescreen 1.78:1 screen ratio, the bonus is in full screen aspect. Strange.
So I give the film a ""thumbs up"" because it's entertaining and worth a watch. But, know going in, that is not a factual biography.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I don't want to give too many details concidering the people have to watch it as a blank sheet, an empty canvas.

I appreciate the product, but nothing beats the atmosphere of the film: the show he never gave.

I've written a radio series about Hank which will be on air later this year.
It features a lot of scenes which i've written, just as the people in this movie the last ride did.
It's great to do and makes de man come alive.
The radio program is called ramblin' man - the hank williams radio tribute.
It will feature all of his recordings and his life story.

About the movie.
much of it is fantasy, the decor is nice but not reel somehow.
the actors are o.k, but its not dramatic enough althoug i love some beautifully made scenes and de guy who plays Hank does his best.

The details are often used abused and re-written.
Its not the reel story but a mix of events and fantasy.

I love the opening of the film which mixes hank on the radio with his daughter Jett. GREAT!

I don't like the background music and a lot of the music used in this film is not well choosen, sorry mister gaiter.

But buy it and enjoy it anyway.

Thanks for making this film and I hope they will make a television series of Hank and his life.
They could even use my radioprogram scenes and story for the script.

5315333,3,B009C30ROU,"Agree with the prior reviewer that the pronouncement at the start of the film ""Most of which follows is true"" is a tip off that this film is another fictionalized version of events surrounding Hank Williams' death.

As one who thinks the contributions Hank Williams has made to country music, in fact, music in general, is second to none (with Merle Haggard either tied and a very close second with respect to country music), I will scoop up any new Hank Williams themed material with some anticipation and expectations. That being the case, this film 'The Last Ride' which received some hype in country music advertising markets, proved to be a disappointment,  As a film, it's very slow action and seems more like a stage play. As a even a dramatized version given the ""Hollywood treatment"" of Hank's last trip (and Charlie Carr's role as the driver), it's far more fiction than fact. For real Hank fans, the biggest disappointment is that there's virtually no Hank music (except covers as part of the soundtrack) which I assume may have something to do with licensing rights issues (an issue that plagued prior Hank films).  So essentially, it's a move about Hank's last days, without accuracy and without Hank's music. Not much left to commend it.

If you're a real Hank fan, you'll recognize kernels of truth in Hank's life (was the musician on the side of the road that Hank has the driver stop so he can visit with him supposed to be Tee Tot?) but overall the film stretches literary/artistic license to levels of Oliver Stone's 'JFK' film of a decade plus ago. Over the years the mystery around Hank's last ride has been scrutinized and investigated to the point were his route those two days has been nailed down -- if the directors of this film were going to fictionalize it to the point they have -- a special feature consisting of a short documentary of a more accurate account and of the problems that being Hank's driver caused Charlie Carr over his life, would have been appropriate.

If you're trying to choose between the Hank DVD/Blu Ray selections here, the one entitled ""Hank, the Show He Never Gave"" by Sneezy Waters (I think I have the singer/actor's name right) is the better choice. It actually has a good selection of Hank's songs performed suitably well by the star of the film.  This film is really for Hank fans who getting everything with a Hank theme in their collection of DVDs and music. Not much of a market/ audience for this film beyond that.",1371254400,4,2477,4.682758620689655

This one begins with a statement that ""Most of what follows is true."" No... it should be ""Some of what follows is true."" And that :some"" is very little.
Still, I can't refuse anything on Hank Williams and will keep searching. This movie drags a bit, makes a lot of assumptions, and downright gets it wrong often. The characters do well, except the man playing Hank, who was not cast very well.
