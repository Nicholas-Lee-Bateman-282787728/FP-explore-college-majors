7844235,3,6303356583,"I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi movies over the years.  This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.

All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,3,366,4.260869565217392
7844236,3,6303356583,"This delightful film is and interesting blend of 20th century meets the future.  I enjoyed it as most SciFi fans would.  Not the big money action film of today, however it has interesting challenges.  On the whole, I consider it Star trek meets TJ Hooker.",986169600,,255,4.622222222222222
7844237,3,6303356583,"The movie has good cast members for the various roles! Evigan is perfect as Jake Cardigan, and you actually get to see old William Shatner in a movie that was based on his first best-selling novel of the same name! The only problem I have is that it's totally unlike the novel which is set in the 22nd century! You would think that since this is Shatner's baby, he should have had more control over it rather than let someone else do damage to a book! If I was Shatner, I would have let Paramount Pictures produce a big-screen version of the movie, and of coarse allowed Shatner to Direct it! Universal did a good movie, but I wish they did better!",972777600,5,648,4.319672131147541
