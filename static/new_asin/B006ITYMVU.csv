4991681,4,B006ITYMVU,"Much better than I thought, and with price gone down (or at leased when I purchased it), not sure of price now?  It was now worth the cost. It's a very unique little movie; Sarah Hagan, ""Jess"" in the movie, plays a despaired, almost hopeless, charactor.  Lost in her own delusional reality, at times, of who she really is, her atmosphere around her, etc. Austin Vickers, ""Moss"", in the movie, is kind of her reality check.  Thu, he has some issues of his own.  Both are so isolated; living in the back woods of Western Kentucky, coupled with unusual up-bring, well what else is there to say. The cover does not do the movie justice, it is not a violent movie, and the cover really dose not have anything to do with movie. Worth watching, maybe on Amazon, and worth purchasing, if price is 10.00 or below.",1422921600,2,804,4.448979591836735

4991683,2,B006ITYMVU,"Not sure what the story line is even about.  In the end is he alone, is she dead, what?",1416441600,,87,3.5789473684210527
4991684,5,B006ITYMVU,"This is a somewhat quirky movie that has sketchy areas, but it is interesting. Took me several viewings to sort through some areas. I suspect it may have been difficult for the female lead to be so empty so much of the time. For the boy this was not so difficult, but he did come across as having some persona.",1411603200,6,310,4.183333333333334
4991685,5,B006ITYMVU,Saw this film at Sundance and again at Nashville. Very moving film. The use of different film stocks to produce the qualities of the way we are able to recall is amazing. How do you remember your childhood? This movie will make you question not only your own memories but also those of all of the people who insist they remember what is real. Be prepared to retake stock of what you think.,1326931200,12,389,4.342465753424658
4991686,5,B006ITYMVU,Saw this at Sundance last year.  It reminded me of some classic American films of the 70's and also of George Washington.  See it on a bigger screen than your iphone and you will be rewarded.,1326326400,7,191,4.277777777777778

8498865,5,B006ITYMVU,Simply brilliant. While it might appear scattered or disjointed everything fit together just write. excellent film not for the many,1509667200,,131,5.6
8498866,3,B006ITYMVU,"Three stars for beautiful cinematography, but the movie was boring.  Nothing ever happens.  Just two cousins hanging out doing stuff.",1508976000,,133,5.6
8498867,3,B006ITYMVU,The movie did not connect with me as much as I thought it would.,1500508800,,64,3.642857142857143
8498868,4,B006ITYMVU,"Though not following a traditional narrative arc, JESS + MOSS is a beautiful film about youth and friendship and summer.",1498953600,,120,5.05
8498869,4,B006ITYMVU,Finally had an opportunity to watch Jess and Moss the other evening. It basically tells the story of two second cousins who live in Western Kentucky. They have no adult supervision and are learning about themselves as well as life in general. When watching you really have to pay close attention because it tells their story in the form of mini vignettes. This is the kind of movie you could watch a second time and receive more from it than what you gained the first time.,1480204800,,473,4.511627906976744
8498870,5,B006ITYMVU,arrived on time and as expected,1452816000,,31,4.333333333333333
8498871,4,B006ITYMVU,"One of those films that you have to piece together as it goes on.  Ultimately, a good film.  But a little strange.",1447804800,,114,4.136363636363637
8498872,5,B006ITYMVU,"It was a good movie, weird. I love watching indie film seeing what first time directors or directors in their early years come up with. This movie you have to pay attention to the dialog to somewhat figure out what's happening other then these characters just wondering around. As you start figuring out what's going on you ge a better sence of the film and an appreciation for the surroundings. Good movie hate the ending.",1446681600,,423,4.653333333333333
