4372875,5,B004GGQMT2,"I have enjoyed watching these videos of selected performances Selena gave to the audiences of Johnny Canales countless times. I will watch them countless times yet to come. Her voice, dancing, smiles, and interaction with the crowd are very well documented. I never tire of watching Selena glide across the stage as she sings and dances, exuding the style, warmth, and even mischievous humor that pops out in subtle ways. Just remember, the videos are at least 17 years old, so the quality is not as sharp as they could be, but the sound is great.",1342310400,7,547,4.708333333333333

4372879,5,B004GGQMT2,"Viva La Selena, the undisputed, forever Queen of Tejano Rock!!!! This is a great continuation of the dvd ""Selena Performances"". It's up close & personal. These performances of Selena & her band, were very well filmed on the Johnny Canales Show, during 1991, 1993, & 1994. It contains different performances than the ones on the ""Selena Performances"" DVD, and it is the perfect companion dvd to that other dvd. Both dvds are fantastic, and a ""must-have"", for any serious Selena fan, and I am definitely one. All of this is in Spanish, but whether you know Spanish or not, you'll still enjoy these fantastic, up close, performances. You get to see Selena up close, and also her band members including her sister, Suzette on drums, and her husband, Chris Perez on lead electric guitar, and also other band members. Chris later founded the Chris Perez Band, and had a big 1999 hit with the song ""My Resurrection"".

The sound on the back of the dvd case states that it is 5.1 & DTS Surround Sound.

If you love Selena like I do, you'll really enjoy both of these ""previously unrealeased"" performances dvds of Selena & her band. Thanks very much!!!!",1313452800,5,1143,4.71

8428700,4,B004GGQMT2,"There are two different DVDS. This one said ""Performances Live""; which I assumed meant there would actual live audio. It's not. It's studio tracks with Selena and the band ""performing"" on the Johnny Canales Show. I won't give it a bad rating solely for the fact that it's better quality watching it on dvd than most uploads from youtube.",1399680000,,337,4.728813559322034
