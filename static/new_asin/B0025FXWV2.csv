3848102,5,B0025FXWV2,I saw this at the Palm Springs film Festival and it was a wonderful story.  The ending was outstanding ! ! !  For all ages.,1270166400,,123,3.88
3848103,3,B0025FXWV2,"**You will need a multi-region player to play this DVD**

As 50-year old parents of an 18-year Autistic son, the better half and I sat down to watch ""The Black Balloon"" with an open mind. She thought it was honest, true to life and moving - I thought it was brutal, clinically exploitive and deeply hurtful to those of us who actually have to live with - and grow old with - this difficult condition.

First up - Autism doesn't sell - so the cover of the DVD slyly tries to pan it off as a teenage love story - when most of movie is dominated by the lead character's Autistic brother whose inappropriate, but unintentional outbursts make life for him, his parents and their family - a living hell.

This is an Icon Production - Mel Gibson's company - and I've found his movies bludgeon you over the head in order to extract emotion. If he can't gore it up, he'll hurt it up. As other reviewers have pointed out, the brother's behaviour is wild (rubbing excrement into the carpet, punch outs at home, tantrums in supermarkets) - some of which does happen, but most doesn't.  No experienced parents would take their son to such situations precisely because it will precipitate such behaviour - these film parents are conveniently clueless - and that just doesn't wash. Then there's the horrific cruelty of the Australian school kids and neighbours - again all of it so over the top as to beggar belief.

But the worst scene is after a particularly horrific home incident, the special needs brother Charlie (played by Luke Ford) supposedly apologises in sign language to his brother Thomas (played by Rhys Wakefield) - this just wouldn't happen. It is precisely because of Autism that Charlie would never make this cognitive leap - and in the real world - it's in this maddening knowledge - that lies so much hurt for siblings. Your brother doesn't progress - your sister doesn't get any better - and most people - including the authorities - couldn't give a toss. But this is a film - and after all that battering-ram stuff - the makers must offer you some hope...

Autism has been used in movies before - and to some good effect; ""Mercury Rising"" with Bruce Willis and most famously Dustin Hoffman as the Savant in ""Rain Man"". But these were simplistic versions of the condition without any of the really nasty self-injurious stuff and effect on the family. ""The Black Balloon"" seems to want to bludgeon you over the head with only the gross stuff- and then somehow arrive at a magical point of tolerance at the end. The real world, however, is slightly different.

It's not all grim of course - it isn't. There's a moment of extraordinary tenderness and one of the best 'growing up' sexy scenes I've ever seen. The gorgeous Gemma Ward plays Jackie (legs as long as the M1 motorway and a face the camera adores) who fancies the slightly odd she suspects brave Thomas (constantly defending his brother).  Along with all the other swimmers, they are at a school safety exercise lesson lying down by the poolside; she leans over him in her dripping swimsuit to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as per her instructor. He has his eyes shut - supposedly drowned. She has to apply mouth-to-mouth - up and down - blowing in air. The way the sunlight catches her wet hair - the drops falling on him - the proximity of such loveliness - the lips that nearly touch, but can't because people are watching - it's beautifully done - really ace stuff...

Also on the up side is Luke Ford's performance as the Autistic Charlie - his mannerisms are very good and at times uncomfortably accurate - our boy displays some of the same. Erik Thompson and Toni Collette are gripping as the parents trying to cope and keep their family together.

I'm not adverse to a difficult watch worth the difficulty, but I found this movie strangely exploitive - and for all the wrong reasons. I'll admit that anything that hurts children - especially special needs children - makes me wince and rage - so perhaps my opinion of the movie simply can't be anything other than biased. My wife thought it was brilliant - finally exposing the pain and difficulty parents of special needs children have to go through. I on the other hand would smash Mel Gibson over the head with a mallet...

One review on the DVD box tells us the movie is ""...life-affirming..."" and ""...a sheer delight..."" Balls.

Make up your own mind folks. As ever, one man's Heaven is....",1239062400,11,4426,4.638569604086846

3848107,2,B0025FXWV2,"I'm a high school teacher and I bought this to show my classes b/c it was only rated PG-13.  There was a lot of sexual inferences and suggestions.  I felt that it would have been inappropriate to show my students.  At first I thought that it wasn't that bad, but every few minutes in the movie there was another comment made, or scene that seemed inappropriate.",1380931200,2,361,4.4393939393939394
3848108,5,B0025FXWV2,"Describing why I like the ""The Black Balloon"" is hard. It's not the usual type of movie I'm drawn to. It doesn't have big explosions or lots of quirky comedy. I also don't particularly relate to anyone in the cast either--I've never been to Australia nor am a teenage boy or have someone with special needs that I'm close to. The plot doesn't have some big plot twist at the end or really any plot at all other than just a few days in the life of a family. And yet, this movie effects me in a way that just cuts me down.

Basic plot: Thomas is a teenage boy with a brother with special needs, Charlie. The two brothers and two parents (Toni Collette is amazing as the mother) live in what reminds me of military like housing, somewhere in Australia, and probably sometime in the 80s. The setting and time is both unique as well as timeless. It neither feels old nor new really--just present. Charlie is both lovable at times, as well as is truly heartbreaking. The movie does not shy away from showing the tremendous stress, exhaustion and even anger that can be part of trying to love and live with someone with tremendous needs. Thomas is just trying to grow up. To put this movie in a box, it could be easily classified as just another ""coming of age film."" And yet, it's so much more.

When I see this movie, I see fundamentally good people all trying to do ""the right thing."" But sometimes, life and our emotions just get in the way. Navigating the tricky landscape of trying to be your own person, yet with family responsibilities both thrust upon you as well as welcomed. Thomas loves his brother Charlie, and yet is constantly feeling like he's being ignored by his parents and comes to resent always having to look after Charlie. And even when Thomas finds a girl who not only puts up with Charlie always being around--but who also really cares for Charlie as well, everything comes crashing down anyway. Not because so much of what Charlie did, or even how Jackie initially reacted--but how Thomas reacted to the ""big confrontation.""

I admit that this movie may have been too depressing for me as a whole if it hadn't had ended on a rather light note, but I also know that I wouldn't feel remotely the same about this movie if it was all just awkward situations and the usual difficulties that come with puberty. I guess that's really the point though--this movie feels a whole lot more like real life than most Hollywood fare. It's messy and complicated and difficult. And yet, there is still a beacon of light and hope that shines throughout it all. And to be cheesy yet honest, it give me hope as well. And I guess that's why it effects me so much.

This movie certainly isn't for everyone, but if you grow tired of watching car chases and soap operas maybe try a movie that might just help you see the world a little bit clearer and with a little bit more joy.",1368230400,,2875,4.429111531190927
3848109,5,B0025FXWV2,"Lots of water symbolism in this movie, like with Charlie's Noah's Ark play, and his brother Thomas' lifeguard training. And there's a bathtub scene at the end!

There's also a scene at an abandoned army training field with Thomas' girlfriend who kind of looks like Amanda Seyfried that probably also has some symbolic undercurrent, like after Thomas gives her a ""beautiful"" empty ammunition shell pendant (during a rain storm), she tells him to close his eyes, and says she imagines beyond the fuzzy blackness, she can see her mom. Charlie is there too!

Thomas' mom's name is Maggie, which is a diminutive of Margaret, which derives from the Greek word for pearl. So maybe the shell had something to do with mom (pearl)? Mom's portrayed by Toni Collette, who later had a role on the United States of Tara (Leeland) as a mom of a daughter who sat on balloons for a web-cam fetish site. Coincidence!?! Probably! She's a good actress!

Thomas' dad works for the Army. His name is Simon and he consults a teddy bear named Rex for advice, and his home life is a disaster! The part where he finally outwits the bullies and rides around the block on his big-wheel is probably the best part of the film!

See this movie, even if it's Australian and doesn't have Noah Taylor. It features an artistic kid rubbing poop into carpet and has a great soundtrack!",1367798400,,1348,4.651260504201681
3848110,4,B0025FXWV2,"THE BLACK BALLOON is an immediately real Australian film about Charlie, a boy-man with severe autism and ADD, and his family. Neither gratuitously shocking nor sugar-coated, it expertly captures the life of the Mollison family. Very fine acting and dialogue, especially from Toni Collette as Charlie's mother. The focal character here is Thomas, Charlie's slightly younger brother, similarly well-played by Rhys Wakefield, and the film effectively captures the love-hate relationship between the ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" brothers. While it gives a rather dim view of adolescence in regards to Thomas's male classmates--not all high school boys are this cruel--it's still very revealing of the complications Thomas experiences in school and in his budding relationship with Jackie, another memorable character convincingly played by Gemma Ward.

Though it has something of an arc, the storyline is mostly episodic and slice-of-life. Plenty of interesting stuff happens, but I still sometimes wished for more of a beginning, middle, and end.

THE BLACK BALLOON contains no really serious gore or violence (at least none where anyone is seriously hurt or killed); still, it pulls no punches in showing the baser aspects of severe autism (e.g., a scene of Charlie rubbing crap on himself). I also have to say--though there's nothing truly ""wrong"" or incorrect about it--that the final scene irked me a little.",1363132800,,1404,5.465437788018433
3848111,5,B0025FXWV2,"Of the very few films currently available that revolve around characters with autism, ""The Black Balloon"" is simply the best. Tristram Miall, the producer of this film, comments in the extras that ""the bar is set very high when you think of Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man', you think of Leonardo DiCaprio in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'"", and because ""these are extraordinary performances, we knew we had to at least match that"". In my opinion as the father of a son diagnosed with moderate level autism, this movie far exceeds either of these two movies in this regard.

Luke Ford, who plays the fifteen-year-old autistic boy Charlie, is phenomenal. And it is satisfying to listen to Ford talk in the extras about his film role, because he just gets it. In discussing his brother Thomas, played by Rhys Wakefield in the film, Ford comments that ""all of his life he's had to deal with his older brother Charlie who suffers heavily from autism, and the film really covers his internal struggle with the hardships that come along with it.""

While I am not familiar with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", the movie ""Rain Man"", while entertaining, is about Savant Syndrome rather than autism, and very much removed from reality. Not only does ""The Black Balloon"" accurately portray a boy with a severe case of autism, it also convincingly depicts life around him, especially his hard-working parents who struggle to care for him, as well as his younger brother, who is often sidelined because of the attention his sibling demands from those around him.

The realistic portrayals in the film are due to their being based on real individuals. In the extras, director and co-writer Elissa Down comments that ""the script was very much inspired from my family and very crazy and eventful life, I've got two brothers that have autism, and the character of Charlie, we based that off my brother who has autism and ADD."" In the movie, Charlie's mother Maggie, played by Toni Collette, mentions in passing that her nonverbal son used to talk when he was very young, which points to a common case of regressive autism rather than the classic case of autism that some other reviewers here suggest.

Maggie accurately sums up her character in the extras: ""I think more than anything, like any good mother, she ultimately loves both her kids so much she'd do anything for them, and I guess the story itself is about an imbalance of focus and attention."" Spoken like a true warrior mother. She is very sensitive toward her son in the film, but at the same time often shows frustration, especially when confronted by recurring events such as fecal smearing, which another reviewer here found humorous, but is a very real and depressing struggle for many parents of autistic children.

In discussing the film, Erik Thomson, who plays father Simon, comments that ""Having spoken to Elissa's dad and spoken to Elissa a lot about it, the journey - for my character anyway, in terms of his relationship with Thomas - is by the end of the film he realizes he's been marginalizing Thomas. It's a small journey, but a big shift for everyone to realize what you subconsciously do in that situation. Charlie is this special needs child who gets all the attention.""

Well recommended to anyone with autism in their lives, and anyone who is trying to understand the struggles of families caring for the 1 in 88 (latest U.S. statistic) and counting. While not every case of autism is as severe as the one depicted in this film, the story line shares so many common elements across the spectrum that it is difficult to have many qualms about it.

In this sense, my opinion here is similar to that of the ""With the Light: Raising an Autistic Child"" series of manga by Keiko Tobe, although in these cases, plots take place 10-20 years ago, before biomedical treatments were common, so some of the behaviors exhibited by these characters are more easily remedied now, and healing is taking place in many cases, due to the research that has been done since that time period. The fact that watching this film has the potential to be especially depressing for parents with young autistic children, however, needs to be realized for those interested in watching it.",1360368000,2,4219,4.803030303030303

3848113,5,B0025FXWV2,"This movie (as one reviewer put, boring, uninteresting and not for him) has just now become one of my favorite movies.  It is SO non [h]ollywood.  The plot carries the movie.  It does not need hollywood action to keep it afloat. Although I like (and own) several genres moves such as action, drama, suspense, comedy, etc, I don't need to be sustained by hollywood's descriptive confines.  Yes, it could be seen as a 'B' movie, but I absolutely loved it.  This movie is most definitely plausible and thought provoking. I believe it is VERY interesting and 'out of the box' yet it has culture, romance, grace, forgiveness and other good qualities. Saw it on Netflix and now I will spend money to purchase it from Amazon.",1344124800,,718,4.666666666666667
3848114,4,B0025FXWV2,"It is a story of a family supporting an autism-stricken son more and more affecting the life of his coming-in-the-age brother.

Also some might prize a family's determination, a movie -willingly or unwittingly- triggers many questions of at least a practical deployment of pre-birth diagnosis and abortion-related issues.",1343952000,,321,5.6875
3848115,5,B0025FXWV2,"Great movie! It had everything. Romantic comedy, emotion, realism and at times just plain funny. A lot of people would think this is (coming of age movie) but I actually believe it is the (age that is coming at us movie.) I so got into the mothers character. The fathers character was so funny yet at times so strong. What was really fantastic was the acting by the young man with autism. He did a great job. Over all I think everyone should see this movie. It should be a required watch for all high schoolers. This generation is going to be dealing with a lot of people with autism and they need to see how much these families have to deal with. Maybe they will have more compassion and not be so judgemental. This movie shows that there is so much more to families then what you see on the outside. When I can laugh, cry, and feel like I just got a gift from watching a movie then I know it is A MUST SEE for everyone!
I bought this DVD and it was my 16yr old son who told me too. He said every teenager should see this movie. So am sharing it with as many people as I can. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family did.(Two warnings, there is some bad words, but they are placed in a realistic way, in places that you would expect. The other warning is for parents with newly diagnosed children with autism, this may not be the time for you to see this movie. Wait a few years because as time goes on you too will be able to appreciate this movie without feeling too overwhelmed.)",1338076800,,1483,4.117241379310345
3848116,5,B0025FXWV2,"I felt like I was watching a home movie and the characters were my family.  While the film may be disturbing to many, it is our day to day life, in such coincidental detail, I cried (happy, happy tears--it was a gift, really).  While there are many documentaries about autism, as well as dramas, I never felt anyone was brave enough to portray severe classic autism.

This is a must-see for parents, siblings, caregivers and teachers of whom deal with persons with severe classic autism.  It reveals (some of!) the secrets of our home lives, which, to us, are all quite normal after awhile.

To my delight, this film is about acceptance to non-acceptance to acceptance again.  It is about genuine love, truth, commitment, and family.  It is real.  I also appreciate that there's no psychobabble to help pull them through...they are weak and strong intermittently, and continue to move onward, for the love of ""Charlie"", and because that's what we all must do.",1304294400,5,959,4.804878048780488
3848117,4,B0025FXWV2,"This is a fabulous movie. It tells the story of the Mollison family and how they deal with the very autistic Charlie. There is a particular focus on Thomas, Charlie's brother and how he copes with adolescence in the face of Charlie's very complicating behaviour. There is also an interesting look at how dedicated parents deal with a very high needs child (he's late teens actually) with dignity and determination. Strangely the most notable actor, Toni Collette as the mother, gets the smaller role here. Husband Erik Thomson, is extremely impressive with a strong role where he lives the creed of looking after your own. He is inspiring!

There is so much to like. The budding relationship between Thomas and Jackie, the stunning Gemma Ward, is wonderfully revealed with tenderness and humour. Everything though is subject to Charlie's unpredictable behaviour. At times it is hilarious but some of his `episodes' are harrowing in the sense you wouldn't know how to respond. So while these can make autism (of this level) a little frightening, it also shows the family at its best and somr of these scenes are extremely rewarding. There are many layers to this film, it has some great things to say about family and growing up and really deserves to be seen. It also has a great Australian music soundtrack!",1295568000,2,1308,4.891891891891892
3848118,3,B0025FXWV2,"I've been watching more and more Australian films over the last few years, mostly because there are a lot of great actors coming out of Australia and when I look into their body of work, I come across their films from there. After discovering young Aussie actor Rhys Wakefield in the trailer to the upcoming film Sanctum (2011), I checked out his recent short film Clearing the Air (2009), and also added his film The Black Balloon (2008) to my Netflix queue.

What I was struck by more than anything else while watching this small foreign indie film today, was the amazing care and craftsmanship that obviously went into it. The movie starts with an incredibly creative opening credit sequence set to good Australian pop/rock music. The graphics for the titles are really cool, creative, and unusual in the way they are presented, which I really enjoyed and felt inspired by. Australian director Elissa Down wrote and directed this film based on her own family and childhood. The Black Balloon is basically a coming-of-age film, following in the footsteps of so many before it, but adding a new unique tale to the collection.

The story centers around Thomas, played very well by Wakefield, and his family. Toni Collette plays the typical ""weird"" mother that we've become accustomed to her playing in The Sixth Sense (1999), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), and About A Boy (2002). And Luke Ford plays Charlie, Thomas' severely autistic brother. Having a ""spastic"", as kids love to call Charlie, presents a lot of challenges for Thomas and his family. Thomas is a teenager who of course feels the pressure of fitting in and just wants a normal brother, a normal family, and a normal teenage life. But meeting Jackie, played nicely by model/actress Gemma Ward, through Charlie's crazy actions, gradually changes things. As Jackie and Thomas become good friends and develop crushes, Thomas learns that not everyone his age judges him based on his brother. And he learns to gradually accept Charlie for who he is.

In terms of filmmaking, the cinematography is outstanding. There are quite a few scenes involving water, both at the pool and at a lake or river. The rich colors and interesting camera moves bring the house and suburban neighborhood where most of the film takes place to life. Set in the early 90's, the costumes and production design easily take you back to that time period. While the acting never rises above good, it also never falls into cheesy Lifetime-esque movie of the week mode. I found the story interesting and the pacing/editing of the film just right.

The Black Balloon doesn't rise above the typical coming-of-age genre film, but it does present another good story for a genre that always has a new batch of young filmgoers to address, and an aging film crowd who never seems to tire of reliving the awkward glory days of their youth. I give The Black Balloon 3 stars out of 5, and recommend it as a weekend afternoon rental for the entire family.",1295222400,4,2972,4.82156862745098

This Australian film is about an army family who has been on the move constantly, moving in to a suburb of Sydney. The family is dad Simon (Erik Thomson) army man, mom Maggie (Toni Collette) who is pregnant, Thomas (Rhys Wakefield) and his autistic brother Charlie (Luke Ford). The story follows their life but also deals with the daily challenges that a family faces when dealing with a child or brother with autism.

3848122,5,B0025FXWV2,"This is not a tearjerker about a handicapped young man and his saintly family, thank goodness.  It's the story of an Australian family rattling along like a train about to derail at any minute.  A very honest, accurate portrait of life with a mentally handicapped teenager.  It's a fun but serious story, often funny, moving and heartbreaking sometimes.

Toni Collette is wonderful and lovable as the mother!

The main character, Thomas, is a quiet teenager who has started at a new high school and spies a girl in his gym class.  Beyond those challenges he has an older brother, Charlie, with fairly severe autism and ADD.  Life at home is wild and unpredictable.  When keys are accidentally left in the front door, Charlie opens it and runs down the middle of the street.  He happens to be wearing only sneakers, underwear and his favorite monkey-ears hat.  It's funny and frightening at the same, because he's obviously in danger of harming himself.  Brother Thomas runs after him, and we get the feeling Thomas has probably been rescuing his brother for all of his life.

It's a very good story, the characters are fun to watch.  All families should be blessed with the love, stamina and sense of humor that these folks have.  But the film is never syrupy or preachy.

Personal note: I have a teenage son with autism.  I would not recommend this movie to families who have a little child w/autism, because it would probably be very depressing.  It's not possible to really predict what level of impairment an autistic child will have when they reach their teens.  I just feel that this movie could easily add fear and stress to parents of, say, a Kindergartner with autism -- and those folks need only love and support!

OTOH, I enjoyed 'Black Balloon' immensely because the teenage years have arrived for us, and it's fun to see another family like ours.  No surprise that the Australian director and cowriter grew up with an autistic brother.

I just have to mention the childrens novel 'Rules' by Cynthia Lord, which is the story of a 12-year-old girl who is coping with a younger brother w/autism.  As with 'The Black Balloon,' it's intriguing to see things through the eyes of the sibling and the family as a whole.

Here's to families who face a major challenge and find ways to get by, even laughing about it some days!",1275091200,11,2330,4.6987654320987655
3848123,4,B0025FXWV2,"This is pretty much the Aussie version of What's Eating Gilbert Grape. The difference here is the special needs brother is severely autistic and he also has A.D.D. While the DiCaprio character in Gilbert Grape was challenged, he never got into any serious trouble. In The Black Balloon, Charlie Mollinson needs near constant attention. I was exhausted after only 10 minutes of watching him.

So here's the rub. Mom's pregnant and is having a hard time keeping up. She'll need to enter the hospital shortly before due date. Dad works in the army so he's gone 40 hours a week, so much of the burden falls on brother Thomas' shoulders. He's the new kid in his high school and the insensitivity of his fellow students makes the task of caring for his brother seem even more daunting.

He does manage (as in Gilbert Grape) to hook up with a young lady who is not put off by his brother's challenges. Love blossoms but it's still a rough road and Thomas blames his autistic brother (beats him) when everything seems it might fall apart.

This is a genuinely good movie. Toni Collette does a great job as the mom (she also helped produce). Luke ford does an outstanding job as the autistic brother Charlie Mollinson. And while Rhys Wakefield does a solid job playing Thomas, it's a just a bit tough to really notice him next to Ford's performance.

If there is any complaint I have about the movie it's that it really doesn't end, it just kind of stops. Yes you see the two brothers in a final scene and yes Thomas is accepting what his life will be with his challenged brother, and the scene is structured to let the viewer know that life will go on for all of these people. But I just didn't feel satisfied. I was actually caught off guard when the credits began to roll because I assumed there was more to come. But this is a somewhat minor complaint given the overall quality of the film. It's well worth the time investment.",1270252800,4,1922,4.498567335243553

8351013,2,B0025FXWV2,"As this film was a Berlin Film Festival Award winner, I anticipated this being more than what, for all intents and purposes, could be a made-for-tv-after-school special.  That's how it plays, and worth watching, but don't expect any depth or emotional nuance.",1437091200,,259,5.166666666666667

Life is not all rainbows and unicorns for anyone, and to laugh along the way in a not so happy situation sometimes is exactly what I need.
