8067925,4,B0009W5LA8,I was able to use this product only briefly as I had surgery on my hand. I was able to play some simple stuff before having to quit playing. Planning to start using this soon as I liked the format and simplicity.,1274400000,,212,4.071428571428571
8067926,4,B0009W5LA8,"Having taken up the mandolin after a 45 year hiatus, I received 2 copies of this book as gifts. One has an instructional CD, the other version is an identical book with a DVD. The DVD is Ok, but you learn more from the CD. It is important when starting out with an instrument that you hear all the selections in the book to make sure you are playing them correctly.

The book covers much and a variety of music styles. It contains tablature and standard notation. The layout is logical. Recommended.",1208736000,,499,4.423913043478261
8067927,5,B0009W5LA8,"I bought the whole 3-book set with DVD+CD's.  For an ultra-novice such as myself, this Method takes the ""baby steps"" I need to establish a firm base for mastering the mandolin.  If you already play a stringed instrument, you can pick up the lessons where you need it.  Great product, great fun!",1194307200,2,294,4.615384615384615
