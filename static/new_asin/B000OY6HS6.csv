8187149,5,B000OY6HS6,I really don't care about what they say about the show. I still a big fan. Any episodes that can give me a laugh will do fine. Also the storyline always keep to thinking and get me to know some of the unsolved questions.,1241913600,,220,4.0227272727272725
8187150,5,B000OY6HS6,"Volume 6 is a great addition to the series. After the boxes gather in the temple of the Great One, the animals become adversely affected by the negative energy emitting from the gathered boxes.  Even the friendship of the maid trio is affected in one episode.  In this volume you get to see King Yuri's real strength played out more... not the power of his demon king form, but the power of his own kindness and heart.  Still, through this proving of himself, one look at the sage Murata makes you feel that it still might be enough for what's coming.  Look for great laughs, touching scenes, and the return of Yuki Gunter and Okiku Gunter.  For anyone who's been keeping up with this series, Volume 6 is certain not to dissapoint.",1227225600,,731,4.507575757575758
8187151,5,B000OY6HS6,"Well, it looks like Kyou Kara Maoh will live to see another day! According to Anime on DVD, Funimation has picked up the distribution rights, and is going to start releasing where Geneon left off. As for this volume, it's definitely what I would consider the ""calm before the storm"". Though some of the episodes are a bit darker (see episode 65), there is still a decent amount of comedy and humor on this disc. I'm definitely looking forward to rounding out my set!",1215043200,5,466,4.559523809523809
8187152,5,B000OY6HS6,"I'm very sad that Geneon has gone out of business. I love Kyou Kara Maoh! It is so fun and interesting and has a lot of intrigue and its just so fun and usually light hearted with some real drama from time to time. A series worth watching over and over again, both Seasons 1 and 2.  I hope season 2 gets picked up again and redistributed with the same voice actors and drawing styles. I hope season 2 will eventually be completed for those of us who wait breathlessly for the next installment. Such a cute and sweet anime. I cannot recommend this anime enough! And I hear on the grapevine that a season 3 is now in production over in Japan! So cool!",1204588800,,649,4.192
8187153,4,B000OY6HS6,"The two previous reviews to me don't seem to be actual reviews on the Kyo Kara Maoh. The series is for the most part light hearted and funny with the occasional dark side thrown in. While it does look like the series will no longer be continuing, I think that's sad because it was entertaining while it lasted. Hopfully another compnay picks it up and doesn't change the voice actors or overall style like what was done with Saiyuki! Please like what mentioned by another reviewer keep in mind that the series might not continue but it is still worth a watch or 2",1200441600,5,563,4.423076923076923
