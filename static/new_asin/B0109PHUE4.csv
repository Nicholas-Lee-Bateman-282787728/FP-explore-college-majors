8721695,2,B0109PHUE4,"I was expecting to laugh at the commentary, but it wasn't good at all.  This was filmed at the juggalo gathering in the wee hours of post 3 am.  Most of the people talking sounded tired and unenthusiastic.  The commentators were goofy and semi serious, even though the wrestling was poor.  I was expecting some brutal deathmatches and commentary in the likes of stranglemania, not at all.  The wrestlers themselves were out of shape, drunk, high, etc, not all, but most.  The matches themselves were just barely passable, in the likes of bad backyard wrestling.  75% of the dvd is forgettable, and 25% is just ok, I wouldn't recommend this one.",1502409600,,644,4.747747747747748
