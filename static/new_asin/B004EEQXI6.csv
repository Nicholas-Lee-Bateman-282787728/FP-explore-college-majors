8426817,5,B004EEQXI6,"I have yet to meet the Claude Lelouch film I don't love.  I love some more than others, but they are all unique, one-off films and if the word auteur has any meaning, and I'm not sure it does for most directors, it certainly must apply to Lelouch.  I've seen most of his close to fifty films and I'm never less than enchanted, mystified, spellbound, and ultimately emotional.  Many of his films seem so convoluted at first and you sit there wondering how it all can possibly play out, but Lelouch, like all great cinema magicians, always seems to pull the rabbit out of the hat.

Now, let's get the bad news out of the way first: Whatever moron changed the title of Mr. Lelouch's film to completely subvert the entire film should be friend in cod liver oil.  The box art, the title all make it seem like a war film - while the war plays a part it is anything but a war film.  The literal translation of the film's original title is something along the lines of: These Loves.  So, the alternate title to this is much better: What Love May Bring.  If you go into this film thinking you're going to see a sprawling war story, of course you'll be disappointed.  The film is hugely autobiographical and tells several stories, and somehow by the end, Lelouch ties it all up beautifully and the emotion of that, as always, just sneaks up on you.  Highly recommended.  The transfer is very nice and the film looks gorgeous.",1522886400,,1415,4.424710424710424
8426818,5,B004EEQXI6,"Any movie by Director Claude Lelouch is great. His Story is interwowen with many lives from different people,very nicely  told and the filming is always very beautiful in pictures,he is a master in that,plus the soundtrack is great too.",1422489600,,236,5.051282051282051
8426819,2,B004EEQXI6,"Ilva, a film projectionists' daughter in pre-world war II France, finds irony's hand upon her when war comes, but don't watch ""What War May Bring"" thinking you're going the see a fine war film. Unfortunately it's not much of a holocaust film either.
It's not these events, but the light mix of vaudeville or variety occurring onstage during Ilva's teenage life that sets the sensibilities of the film. Yet as background for a story about irony and survival, a discordant and slightly surreal tone is created. Ilva's life is not so much in the theater as it IS theater, and somehow this entitles her to escape many consequences. The greater irony is that Ilva's choices have grave consequences for almost everyone else she knows or meets along the way.
So if world war II impinges upon Ilva, it does not crush; and when the Normandy landings arrive, they seem out of place. Ilva does not need the coming 'liberation' [Ilva avoids the holocaust almost completely by consorting with a ranking German].
Overall, the movie struck me as akin to a melding of ""Sunshine"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" with overtones of ""The Producers"" thrown in for fun, but it does not succeed at the intimacy of the former film and it does not succeed at creating the historical scale of either one.
Before the allies arrive, dense montages of strutting German occupiers have a vaudevillian tone of their own- director LeLouch's own personal judgement seeming rather too transparent at those moments. And in a strong preface to the main story, an expose of Ilva's family's experiences in the 1st world war- intended to lend historical continuity (for irony had a strong hand then as well)- somehow fails to mesh. What happens to them, happens to THEM; and as such it has rather less to do with Ilva than more. The result was that for me, such prefacing did not lend to my understanding of- or sympathy for- the protagonist.
I feel the best characters in film do more than inform; they teach- and if done well, they resonate within us with truths that we may never otherwise know personally. There is nothing to learn here. And all of these themes have been treated with with greater beauty, greater irony and stronger storylines in the other films I mention. I simply could not make the stretch and suspend my disbelief.
Footnote: at 119 minutes run time, this dvd is 4 minutes longer than the current Blu-ray disc, but the extra material does little to clarify the story- or to change my opinion that the film is too long in either format.",1381276800,,2513,4.7266514806378135

8426821,5,B004EEQXI6,"Every once in a while you see a movie that changes you and makes you grateful that you saw that movie.  Slumdog Millionaire was one of those movies for me.  I saw this film, What War May Bring (or What Love May Bring) at an international film festival in Chicago and I was blown away.  I think you'll really enjoy this film, it's a little long but totally worth it in the end.",1357257600,,376,4.123287671232877
