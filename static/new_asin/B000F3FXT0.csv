8116762,1,B000F3FXT0,"I ordered this DVD without realizing that it is the the same as another the I already have. ""The Rolling Stones The Ultimate  LA '75 "" is the same DVD. (The disk itself is titled ""The Rolling Stones Ultimate LA Blues 1975) So, I have the program contained in the DVD but I do not have this DVD's particular disk. Don't know why this is the case!",1418083200,,345,4.149253731343284
8116763,5,B000F3FXT0,Great performance by the Stones on their 25th anniversary Steel Wheels Tour from 1989..I was there in Philly at the Vet for the tour and its great to see a good cd from an old vhs tape.,1399334400,,185,4.027027027027027
8116764,4,B000F3FXT0,"I AM GIVING THIS A FOUR STAR RATING BECAUSE STONES FOOTAGE FROM THE 1975 TOUR IS SO HARD TO COME BY. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS FROM FAIR TO POOR BUT STILL BETTER THAN NOTHING,THE SOUND IS FAIR. I AM STILL GLAD I PURCHASED THIS.",1362441600,5,224,4.113636363636363
8116765,5,B000F3FXT0,"It's German MAWA PAL Region 2 Music DVD, Ain't Import USA - Canada NTSC !!!!! Besides, it's great music concert movie for Stoner all over the world",1310774400,,147,4.481481481481482
8116766,3,B000F3FXT0,"This was a great concert. I should know, because I was there. The DVD does not do justice to the actual show. This is not an official Rolling Stones release, but it was pro shot. Why anyone would want to pay money for this when you can get it for FREE at any of the various DVD trader's sites, I don't know. Don't put money into bootlegger's pockets. If you'd like to see this concert, google ""dvd traders"", and look for it that way. As far as the concert dvd is concerned. I give it 3 stars because the audio is not 5.1 and while it is pro shot, it isn't the best quality I've ever seen.",1182038400,2,588,4.034188034188034
