3714509,5,B000066C9F,Max McLean's way of speaking of Scripture is amazing!!  He brings the gospel so true to life.  It is the whole gospel memorized!!  What a great DVD!,1360281600,2,148,4.407407407407407
3714510,5,B000066C9F,I enjoyed it immensely. The words and flavor of the message hung about me for days afterwards...in a lovely way. A wonderful experience.,1352160000,,136,4.956521739130435
3714511,5,B000066C9F,I found the reading very soothing and was helped by the simplicity of the stage setting and the voice of the actor who expressed the different moods within the text.,1337558400,,165,4.533333333333333
3714512,5,B000066C9F,"Faith aside, this is a beautiful and fully engaged performance by a marvelous actor and great storyteller. He reminds us of the power, tension and brevity of the Gospel of Mark. No wasted words by the author. No wasted gestures by the actor. A tremendous fit and an inspiration to storytellers everywhere.",1332547200,,305,4.884615384615385
3714513,4,B000066C9F,"I ordered both this version and the original stage presentation DVD that this one replaces&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mark-s-Gospel-as-Told-by-Max-McLean-DVD-All-Regions/dp/B0001F2U4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mark's Gospel as Told by Max McLean - DVD - All Regions</a>&nbsp;because I wasn't sure which I would like better and I could always share the other copy with someone who would enjoy it. I ordered it having seen various clips on Youtube, so I already knew that I would like the overall presentation regardless. But in trying to decide which version to buy, I had hoped that there would be a comparison of the two so that I could make a good decision. Not having found that, I offer it here from my own point of view.

Max McLean is definitely a master storyteller and to have any of the Gospels told in such a way is always a treat.
The original stage presentation (not this one) presents Max McLean simply telling the story of Mark, reciting the Scripture in an intimately familiar, storytelling way - and doing so very compellingly under a spotlight on a dark stage with only a chair as a prop. The new version (this one) is also a stage presentation, but brighter and with the occasional smattering of maps and dramatic sound/light effects that in my opinion add to, rather than detract from, the sense of what is going on at various points in its telling. But in watching the two back-to-back, I find that am struck more by the simple storytelling quality of the original presentation.

That might not be so, however, were it not for the fact that - at least to me - Max McLean just talks a lot faster in this one. A little too fast, in my opinion. I gather there had been some time restraints onstage, maybe? Maybe it's my rural southern roots where we talk a little more slowly than some. That's entirely possible. But sometimes I have to listen extra closely just to try to follow what he is saying, and in a way it loses a little something. But I still wouldn't turn my nose up at it if this were the only one I could get my hands on. Both are just really good.",1331769600,19,2127,4.79291553133515
3714514,5,B000066C9F,"Max McLean is at his best in this dramatic presentation of the Gospel of Mark.  For every person with an interest in God's Word, Max makes the words jump off the page and gives the reader a sense of the very presence of Jesus being in the room as each chapter is recited.

I will play this DVD regularly through out my years of Bible study.",1300492800,4,340,4.136363636363637
3714515,4,B000066C9F,"Most people read the Bible in small portions, but hearing Max McLean's 94 minute one man performance of the entire Gospel of Mark will give you a new and powerful encounter with God's Word.

Mark's Gospel is non-stop action as it describes the 3 1/2 year public ministry of Jesus Christ. McLean recites the Gospel nearly word-for-word from the NIV and his acting interprets many scenes well. For example, he shows the humor in Mark 1:37-38, where after an early morning search for Jesus, the disciples tell him, ""Everyone is looking for you!"" In reply, Jesus ironically says, ""Let's go somewhere else!"" In Mark 5, McLean beautifully draws out the tender disappointment of the formerly demon possessed man when Jesus tells him to stay put in his hometown and tell others what he had done for him.

There were moments, like immediately at 1:1-3, where it seemed like McLean was merely reciting, and as a result, minimizing its significance. Mark's claim in verse 1:1 that Jesus is the, ""Son of God"" is an important inclusio with centurion's likewise declaration at 15:39. Also, at chapter 16, McLean includes the highly disputed words of 16:9-20, which probably wasn't an original part of Mark, but added later. Most likely, Mark ends with 16:8. I would love to have seen how McLean concluded the Gospel at that point.

All in all, this is an excellent resource. It can be shown in two parts in a Sunday School class, or all at once in a small group setting. For best effect, get rid of all distractions, so you can focus on the performance without interruption. The original listeners of Mark's Gospel heard it in its entirety. You should too.",1296864000,10,1642,4.774647887323944
3714516,4,B000066C9F,"Max Mclean's trained voice and dramatic readings are truly a pleasure to watch. The only reason I've given this four stars rather than five is because I've also seen his ""Genesis"" video, which was ever so slightly better in my opinion.
Anyone who thinks reading the Bible seems dry, boring and difficult needs to watch this video and the ""Genesis"" video and see how it can be exciting! And seeing someone read (recite, actually) so dramatically will spill over into your personal reading of other sections of scripture, and you'll begin seeing just how exciting it can be!",1069286400,10,572,4.846938775510204

3714522,5,B000066C9F,"One of the best, if not THE best DVDs to have in your library and give to others. Many people have never read the Gospels in their entirety.  You can hear and watch the Gospel of Mark, word for word, performed in 94 minutes, with helpful props such as maps that help you understand, for example, where Jesus and his followers are traveling from and to.  Why would you not do that, multiple times?  Why would you not get groups of people - family, friends, and yes, even enemies - to watch it with you?

You will probably pick up on some of the humor and emotion of Jesus and the Gospel by watching Max's performance that you would miss in your own reading of the same text, but which is clearly there.",1407628800,2,701,4.2481203007518795

3714524,3,B000066C9F,"Purchased for small group showing and study.

Pros: an engaging one person dramitazation of the Book of Mark.
  Faithful to the English versions of Mark.

Cons: No menu option
  Thus no chapter index
  Very rapid presentation, doesn't allow time to digest content.
  Live recording complete with laughter from the audience

Conclusion: Not really suitable for small group study, but would be useful as an overview prior to starting an in depth study. Some may be put off by the British accent.",1390867200,,493,4.962962962962963
