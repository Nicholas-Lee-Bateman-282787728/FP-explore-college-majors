8581562,1,B00CGCSX0Y,"Very biased view of the events that happened on 9/11. Very poor animation. Limited in facts. This is a whitewashed, biased version of what really happened. There are always two sides to every story and this only portrays one side. Children will be misled into thinking one thing, then distrustful of adults who don't tell the truth when they find out the facts. Not recommended.",1483660800,,378,4.8307692307692305
