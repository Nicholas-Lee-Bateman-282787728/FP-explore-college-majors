8440941,3,B004TTOQQ2,"The last of the three movies Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda made together, and certainly the least enjoyable -- The Lady Eve, hands down their best (and one of the funniest films ever made), and The Mad Miss Manton (their first), an enjoyable mystery/comedy from the late 1930s, both far superior to this rather lackluster effort.  You can't not like these two, but they're far better together elsewhere.",1439164800,,406,4.970588235294118

8440943,5,B004TTOQQ2,One of Barbara Stanwyck's lesser-known (but in my opinion) entertaining comedies backed by the superb Henry Fonda.  A sweet romance that you're sure to enjoy.,1388793600,,158,5.32
8440944,3,B004TTOQQ2,"There are films where you drink up every moment of celluloid; a thirst that isn't quenched when the curtain is drawn because you want more. Then the inevitable deep sadness that comes when you realize that there isn't any more. A quick click of the remote and suddenly, like myself, you screen that same film over and over again. To date, and I'm not the type to keep a scorecard, I've probably watched 'The Lady Eve' and 'The Mad Miss Manton' more than a dozen times a piece - that's how much I love the pairing of Fonda and Stanwyck.

Okay, that said, now we come to 'You Belong To Me'.

This 1941 production was the third and final time the two stars were together on-screen. And given the dearth of laughs in this middling romantic comedy - you have to wonder if this movie was the reason.

So heartbroken over the failure of this film.

True, that spark of energy, that undefinable chemistry between the pair is unquestionably there. But the lack of cogent direction is readily apparent.

Swinging wildly between slapstick and drudge melodrama, Director Wesley Ruggles constantly tears the pair apart, to only have them come back together, repeatedly, and with no real purpose other than multiple attempts at ham-fisted emotional manipulation.

Believe I counted about a dozen such set-ups. Mind you, this is a 94 minute film, so we're talking an average of every seven minutes where Fonda's character, Peter, makes one terrible jealousy-fueled mistake after another, then runs down (literally in some cases) Stanwyck's character, Dr. Helen Hunt. An impassioned and fevered clench, a desperate kiss, and all is made well again. Again, repeatedly.

What the heck?

This film is damn near unwatchable given this ridiculous see-saw tempo. And in truth, no woman, even in 1941, would've been able to handle this man's jealousy driven madness. Love, and I recognize the irony given that this is a romantic comedy, love isn't a deep well that forever disgorges an unending supply of forgiveness. Most women will draw a line. Push against it too hard and they will cut you off. So there's a real sense of unreality, almost a man's wishful ideal in her character. Complete nonsense of course, but that's the uncomfortable premise permeating the entire movie.

Spotlighting the obvious failure of Director Ruggles, note that in that same year of this film's release, these same two actors produced a romantic-comedy classic by way of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lady-Eve/dp/B00005JH9B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lady Eve</a>'.

Clearly he wasn't up to the task. And worse, possibly sank the impetus for potential future films that Fonda and Stanwyck might've made.

Despite what the new Orwellian social-media groupthink says about talent being universal, some really do have it and other do not. Ruggles did not. And a brief review of his filmography proves that he wasn't a director of note. I happened to screen two other films he helmed - both were disappointments.

To truly enjoy the wonderful energy possible when Stanwyck and Fonda were on screen, please check out the aforementioned '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mad-Miss-Manton/dp/B0029BK1PW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mad Miss Manton</a>' and 'The Lady Eve'. Leave screening this flick to movie completists and/or the hardcore OCD stricken.

I would tag this as a 2 star, but my conscience wouldn't let me rest knowing I did it to such a fine pair of actors.",1379808000,5,3515,5.26654740608229
8440945,5,B004TTOQQ2,"Very cute movie with Barbara Stanwyck as Henry Fonda's doctor and then she becomes his wife. A great comedy. Not as well-known as their pairing in ""The Lady Eve"" but an enjoyable film none the less. Grab it while you can.",1345248000,,221,4.414634146341464
8440946,3,B004TTOQQ2,"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the
stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders...",1334620800,3,1785,4.894389438943894
