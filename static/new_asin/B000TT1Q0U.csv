However, I just want to add some comments to the earlier review which I assume will be shown above.  I agree with the review as given, so I do not want to be redundant.  I recorded this movie on on my DVR about a week ago and just watched it over the weekend.  I really loved it.  The first thing I do when I find such a movie, is to check its availability on DVD.  To my disappointment this movie is only available in PAL region 2 which is not compatable with the USA region 1 format.  Many movies I just watch and delete, but when I find one that I really like, if it is available, I buy it so I can enjoy it again.  I don't understand why so many movies are not available to the US market, especially when they are made for American networks like Syfy or LMN.  I'm running out of space on my DVR trying to save movies that I can't buy or rent on DVD.  Without constantly checking availability of films, it is impossible to check on the status of their future availabilty.",1275177600,3,1057,4.038461538461538
8210867,4,B000TT1Q0U,"I watched ""The Dead Will Tell"" on LMN tonight and loved it. I was hoping to get the DVD for my mom as she loves supernatural-themed mysteries but unfortunately it's not available on DVD (well, the available DVDs are Region 2 and 4 which are incompatible with US players). Set in New Orleans (and the cinematography is quite beautiful), this 2004 movie stars Anne Heche as Emily Parker, a successful attorney who meets and falls in love with Billy (Jonathan LaPaglia) a photographer. Emily receives an antique engagement ring from Billy and from that point on, begins experiencing visions of a woman who seems to be in some kind of torment and who is trying to send Emily a message. When Emily begins investigating, she uncovers some startling facts - the woman she 'sees' is long dead and missing for 35 years, presumed to have been murdered. The suspect, Paul Miller (Chris Sarandon) is still alive, leading the life of a reclusive gardener.

As Emily digs deeper, she uncovers some even stranger truths, like her fiance's mother's (played by Kathleen Quinlan)connection to the dead woman. The story flows really well, and is highly atmospheric, giving it a Gothic feel. The credible acting, especially by Heche and Sarandon make this a compelling watch (oh, and there's a supporting role by Eva Longoria as Heche's assistant). The element of suspense holds up throughout the movie, and makes this an above average suspense thriller.",1268611200,,1434,4.950207468879668
