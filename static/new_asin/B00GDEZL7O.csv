Andrews Blu-ray Review: Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949) A jet black as comedies come, 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' makes even multiple murders seem funny and even somewhat endearing. Now re-released in cinemas ahead of a Blu-ray release, it's the perfect time to relive this delicious slice of class obliteration. The plot is well known: a destitute man [Dennis Price] is very distantly related to royalty  the same royal family that snubbed his mother's cries on her deathbed when she needed help the most. Swearing revenge, Louis [Dennis Price] decides to kill his way to the dukedom.

The twist is that every member of the ill-fated D'Ascoyne family is played by Alec Guinness, and of course he does it to perfection. If anyone needs proof of the great actor's range, this is required reading. It's hard to imagine Stanley Kubrick casting Peter Sellers in multiple roles for 'Dr Strangelove' without 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' paving the way. Casting the same actor in a wealth of roles could be considered a gimmick, but even if this were true and eight different actors played the royals, 'Kind Hearts' still has enough juice in the script department to get by as a blisteringly fierce social satire.

Robert Hamer's direction does not play up to the wildness of the story, instead remaining grounded and slow  almost deadpan; observant; shying from intimacy or taking sides. This isn't a silly film either. Dennis Price plays the murderer with cool conviction and slimy calm instead of cackling with glee, while Guinness crafts a range of characters that are either truly likable, entirely loathsome or just innocent bystanders to the carnage that befalls them. A true classic and another stellar restoration job from Optimum.

The Lavender Hill Mob (Charles Crichton, 1951) Once again Optimum are doing a fine job restoring the old Ealing classics for the big screen and their Blu-ray debuts, and 'The Lavender Hill Mob' is certainly no exception. The restoration job (as evidenced in the brief comparison feature on the disc) is outstanding, removing huge patches of grain and restoring the contrast back to its optimum levels. It's a fine way to sample this classic film if you haven't already. The film has Sir Alec Guinness excellently cast (and in Oscar nominated form) in the lead as a mild-mannered gold bullion manager for the Bank of England. For years he's been cunningly plotting to rob the gold for himself and when he meets an eccentric artist [Stanley Holloway], who has an ingenious method of transporting melted down metals, the plan is set.

According to the filmed Martin Scorsese introduction on the Blu-ray, screenwriter T.E.B. Clarke researched the heist by simply asking bank staff how they'd go about it. The ins and outs of those loose security policies formed the backbone of his witty, deservedly Oscar winning script, but what's more interesting than the caper that reaches fever pitch is the characterisations.

Looking at the film now, the relationship between Sur Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway seems almost homoerotic when they hold each other and look down at their gold and retort with a swoon-like ""our first born"" Regardless of which way you look at it, their chemistry is superb. It drives the silliness into sincerity. Once again, a true classic and another stellar restoration job from Optimum.

The Man in the White Suit (Alexander Mackendrick, 1952) 'The Man in the White Suit' has got a lovely plot hook that it fails to reel in: A chemist [Sir Alec Guinness] named Sidney Stratton creates a new type of fabric that doesn't wear out or get stained, prompting fierce interest from rival mill owners who instead of wanting to use his invention actually want to bury it so they can continue earning more from disposable fabrics. This opens the door to a pessimistic view of the dangers of new science, the cruelty of steadfast business, the stupidity of small-minded townsfolk, the disregard of a brainy man's invention against tradition.

It's a complex issue but Oscar nominated script from Roger MacDougall, John Dighton and Alexander Mackendrick essentially just sends Sidney on a silly run-around town when it should've built on a winning romance between Sidney and a mill owners daughter Joan Greenwood (a brilliant character actress of 'Kind Hearts & coronets' fame). 'The Man in the White Suit' is enjoyable yes and unlike many comedies, it's actually got something to say. But when it tries? Mothballs...

StudioCanal's beautiful restored Blu-ray presents this beloved Ealing comedy with a wonderful print. Bonus-wise, there's a 13 minute appreciation piece, a Restoration Comparison, a Stills Gallery and a Trailer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There is only one audio track on all 3 Blu-ray discs: English 2.0 LPCM Mono. For the record, Optimum Home Entertainment has provided optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. The audio has been optimised as best as possible. Understandably, the English 2.0 LPCM Mono track has a rather limited dynamic amplitude, but the sound is consistently crisp and more importantly stable. There are no problematic audio distortions. I also did not detect any pops, cracks, and excessive hiss to report in this review for all 3 discs.

Finally, if asked to decipher the secret of the Ealing Comedies success, you could do worse than highlight the films Guinness made for them, and in particular the three StudioCanal have chosen for their first Ealing Blu-ray Collection. These delights of British cinema epitomise everything good about the studio and, some would say, an age of this country's history now sadly long gone. The public were looking for escapism during the years immediately following the Second World War and Ealing gave it to them. In films like Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Man in the White Suit, the underdog - all working-class heroes, in two cases played by Alec Guinness (in Kind Hearts, the role went to Dennis Price) - always comes out on top. Little remains today of Ealing or its star player Alec Guinness other than the images captured for posterity on film - but what wonderful memories they invoke. I was going to start purchasing the individual Ealing Comedies, but I am glad I held back, as this Volume 1 is totally stunning and well worth I waited to add it to my Blu-ray Collection and I cant wait for the next set of The Ealing Studios Collections Blu-ray releases and if they are as stunning as this first set of 3 films, then we are in for some really fantastic ultimate re-mastered Blu-ray releases. Very Highly Recommended!
