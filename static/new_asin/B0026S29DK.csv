3856902,5,B0026S29DK,"Okay, I bought this from one of the vendors on Amazon under the new section for about $8.00 and for that amount it was well worth it. Now I'm not really a beginner, but I haven't played in a long time and wanted to see what I can learn from it. What I really liked about it was that in the beginning the instructor talks about how to get that Metal sound from the Amp and effects, and he doesn't use or illustrates expensive guitar equipment to show you, he used items that anyone can buy at a low cost. The one thing I wish the DVD had was downloadable PDF's of the lessons. Now if you have played guitar and feel you are still pretty much a beginner this DVD is for you, but one worming...this DVD does start out slow and builds from there. All in All it's a good DVD.",1269302400,22,770,4.03921568627451
3856903,5,B0026S29DK,This DVD really open my mind about the basic one should now to play the metal type of music. I believe that i can actually improve myself from here to play metal sound,1267315200,3,167,4.090909090909091
3856904,5,B0026S29DK,this a great video and helpful I use it just about every day. the best,1264809600,5,70,3.7333333333333334
3856915,5,B0026S29DK,"I have a number of dvd's by Mr. Sternal and every one of them are great and present a lot of information. I think these dvd's are a great addition to any collection, even if you're familiar with a subject the dvd's are laid out in a way that makes them very easy to look up a subject and see it explained in detail.",1421452800,2,315,3.9375
3856916,5,B0026S29DK,Looks good! Perfect for beginners. Instead of teaching a song he gives a blueprint for metal improv. Really neat.,1420761600,2,113,5.0

3856918,5,B0026S29DK,"Great learning ,easy to do and to follow.",1417910400,,41,4.25
3856919,5,B0026S29DK,Would not say easy but some really good riffs here.,1406937600,,51,4.2
3856920,3,B0026S29DK,"This is great for beginners because it has clear achievable goals to get to which is the entire song, which I think psychologically develops confidence if you can play an entire song even if it is relatively easy, and the pacing is great.
However, this is not for intermediates, I'd think intermediate would involve tapping, legato and some more techniques and levels of challenge not covered here.
Also, I got the VOD version so it does not come with separate tabs which is a big bummer.

But definitely recommended for that metal enthusiast who is just picking up the guitar.",1398816000,2,577,4.77
3856921,4,B0026S29DK,"It is a cool video, but I bought the Amazon instant video. It does not have the bonus stuff such as the play along and the guitar chords guide referred to in the video constantly. I wish I had just bought the DVD instead. Amazon you should definitely include it or not put it up for an online video.",1394496000,2,299,4.084745762711864
3856922,5,B0026S29DK,"I've only been through this once so I don't have it down yet.
But, I was surprised how well I did.
The instructor walks you through amp settings and gives great tip for getting that true metal sound from your guitar.
This includes a few simple ""songs"" the instructor has come up with for players to hone their skills.
I will play this over and over again until I have it down.  I think it's a fantastic tool for learning lead playing metal.  I have been concentrating mostly on rhythm but this is easy to follow and understand.
It's the FIRST instructional video I've purchased where the instructor actually started from the beginning, working up to a complete song without losing me.
Great Video, I will use it often until it's second nature.
5 PLUS stars for this one.
If you are a beginner, this is the ONE for you.",1394064000,3,818,4.446666666666666
3856923,5,B0026S29DK,"I like a no nonsense approach to learning new stuff, and this course is a very to the point approach to learning serious Metal guitar. There's little fluff to get in the way of learning the proper way to play Metal, and it's pretty fast paced with a great method(tempo)employed to help you get the chords down in a jiffy. Great additional items are also included ,like a proper gear list to get the great Metal sound and tips on how to use said equipment, nice.

All told, this is the easiest to follow, best done example of how to play Metal guitar right, no muss, no fuss. Highly recommended!",1391558400,3,594,4.4
3856924,5,B0026S29DK,"Dvd arrived very quickly, thank you. The lesson on the DVD are well organised providing a good preogression for a beginner like me. This Dvd is very easy and nice for a beginner. I hope to lerning fast.",1390262400,,202,4.342105263157895
3856925,3,B0026S29DK,it really doesn't show anything to help you. i would not recommand it to no one.the guy talking is really loud and funny.,1365465600,,121,4.304347826086956
3856926,5,B0026S29DK,Well worth it.  Very easy and a nice pace for a beginner.  I like going back to review chapters. I see a major difference in my progress in a very short time.,1362096000,6,158,3.90625
3856927,5,B0026S29DK,Got this for my son as part of his Christmas gift along with Fender Presents and easy guitar scales. He loves them and learning fast!,1359417600,3,133,4.36
3856928,5,B0026S29DK,"I know some what of a lot of guitar theory and such. This DVD is absolutely what it sets out to do teach you three metal songs that the author has created. Way too many people expect this DVD to turn you into Mark Morton (All That Remains Guitarist) that comes with years and practice. But this DVD will set you on the right path, it teaches you all the foundation techniques in order to understand and play metal. He gives good examples in the music to show you how the tecniques are applied musically. I also own his lick by lick Metallica which is amazing, too many people out there try to write tabs for music and some of those people tab the music wrong the author gets it right in a easy to understand format without all the laden guitar terminology. This book is good for a beginner or advance beginner.",1357430400,3,810,4.300653594771242
3856929,5,B0026S29DK,"i like this dvd for alot of reasons.it is thorough,and goes slowly for the beginner,it gives you excercises for developing chops,and i could go on and on.",1338854400,3,154,4.7407407407407405
3856930,4,B0026S29DK,"I play guitar and have played since the late 80s but am by no means a maestro on the instrument and am always trying to find a new way to do what I enjoy doing. Mark John Sternal has done an acceptable job with how he shows a simple way to play some of the typical things Heavy Metal guitarists play like chuggin on the low E string as well as using a scale (here he uses the E minor pentatonic scale) and explains why he's doing and how he's going to do it.

Not sure if I'd label this intermediate because while some of the tricks may seem intermediate they aren't really. Metal guitar gets heavily into Modal Scales as well as heavy arpeggiated riffs which aren't discussed here.

What Mark DOES do is explain things like how to get a heavy tone by how to set up your amps as well as your stomp box settings. Then he explains some of the things Metal guitarists use such as pull offs, hammer-ons as well as scale use. The material is graduated to a point where you are playing the very song that plays through while the DVD is parked at the Menu. It's not a bad tune but nothing all that intermediate.

If you're an intermediate player, you may want to pass on this however if you're a beginner and you've been wanting to learn how to jam with some of the big boys, this DVD will give you a step in the right direction. If you learn the song on here, you can pick it apart in pieces & use them to comp with others in a garage band.

Overall I give this DVD 4 out of 5 stars due to it being an excellent beginner starting point but not quite intermediate (in MY opinion - your mileage may vary).",1336694400,19,1597,4.108974358974359
3856931,5,B0026S29DK,"I'm a self-taught church keyboard player for over 10 years and beginner classical/pianist, I've been playing and learning guitar on the side for 5 maybe 6 years. When I purchased this for direct download I didn't know what to expect. But when I played it for the first time I ended up finding a tremendous amount of information although I already know how to use and am proficient at ""Power Chords"", this video includes much more than power chords. You'll learn many ""riffs"", ""solos"", and ""hammer-ons"" used in modern metal songs. The techniques and chords he shows you can all be put together to play different ""songs"" and I guarantee every time that you watch this video you will find something worth while. He slows down so he could teach you how to play it step-by-step, then he teaches you to keep the pulse or the rhythm by adding a metronome. I'll admit that this video doesn't cover everything that you'd need to know but if you want to be a well-rounded guitarist you need to add as many playing style to your arsenal as possible. Every guitarist aspiring, beginner, or intermediate should buy this.",1330387200,5,1107,4.682051282051282
3856932,4,B0026S29DK,"I am fairly new to guitar and found this dvd.  I could not find much info on it so i rented it.  I scanned through it before i tried to play it and was disappointed.  Next day i sat down and played along and was very happy.  The instructor's method of teaching was very good, he actually approached the teaching as if it was on dvd as opposed to others that just explain and play.  He would slowly show you how and where to play notes/chords and the music tabs were directly below him playing which was awesome.  He then would play it in a ""play along"" style (tabs on screen) to a metronome.  I felt that this approach was very helpful and kept me interested.  It was pretty basic stuff but it all came together to make different songs which i liked.  I would have given int 5 stars if i could access the music tabs but i could not and suspect that if you purchase via download you would have the same issue.  The only other dvd set i have tried was Rock House Method's Rock guitar and i enjoyed the Easy Metal Guitar video a bit more.",1330041600,3,1035,4.13
3856933,5,B0026S29DK,"Well here goes, when I started playing guitar in the 80's, all i wanted to do was learn songs, and it was usually a familiar intro or favorite solo here and there, didn't take the time or have the patience to learn how chords fit together with scales,playing in the right key etc. now that i have really got into this DVD, it is an excellent learning tool, learning notes,scales and chords by the key that I've always played but didn't take the time to get educated, was in to much of a hurry to be a ""rockstar"" back then and not learn the essentials, $12.00 give or take for this DVD is a steal, I would say beginners through intermediate, would get a lot out of this DVD, do yourself a favor, buy it,lock yourself in a room for the weekend, put this baby on and start jamming, wish they had quality DVD's like this back then. I have the AC/DC DVD as well, its great and the EVH is on the way Thank you Mark John Sternal, for keeping it simple and making it a blast to play/learn again.

For my surprise I realized that it was a dvd, so no matter I'll try it, I thought... Well, I just can say this is not a good stuff if you are looking for something to help improve your skills and knowledge don't try this nor any other product from these series Easy Guitar bla bla bla, don't tell that I didn't warn you!",1296259200,,487,3.979591836734694

8353568,5,B0026S29DK,"I am very impressed with this DVD. Mark John Sternal is an excellent instructor, The close up filming makes learning really easy. It starts out at a slow easy pace and gradually speeds up. I was able to make something that sounded like music as opposed to what sounded like a cat being murdered before !!!! I did such after only watching the DVD for less than an hour !!! This video will give you a great start to being able to play music. I plan on buying more of these videos after I have mastered what this one contains. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to play heavy metal music. Most music teachers want to teach you traditional cords and music theory and after several visits (and a couple hundred bucks) you still can't play anything that sounds cool. With this video you will be able to play cool metal riffs after just a few hours. I am still taking professional music lessons, but now I am getting more out of each lesson than I ever did before !!! This video has kept me interested in learning to play where before I was frustrated and about to give up on learning to play.  This DVD touches lightly on how to adjust your amp and a little bit on effects pedals... I would like to find a video that is more extensive on how to use those.",1443657600,2,1270,4.24793388429752
