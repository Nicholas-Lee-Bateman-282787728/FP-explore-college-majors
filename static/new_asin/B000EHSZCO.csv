8110352,4,B000EHSZCO,Well done and very funny!  Hard to believe much of it was adlibbed.  Kudos to the actors for being so funny and believable.  Director Jared Johnson's bizarre sense of humor is at its best in this piece of fiction made to look like a documentary.  The idea of a documentary about a man who may have turned into a horse is an idea only he would cook up.  If you want to see something truly original then I recommend this short movie.,1144454400,4,431,4.2073170731707314
