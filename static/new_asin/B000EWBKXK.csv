8115126,3,B000EWBKXK,"This movie follows a young Aum disciple who acts as the spokesperson for their cult while ""The Master"" is on trial. He has to deal with an agressive media and angry citizens.

I was expecting an explanation of the attack, but the people filmed do not appear to have been involved in it. It does give an interesting insight into Japanese life. The people who give the young man advice tell him to get a job and work hard. The police operate differently and that's pretty interesting.

I have to admit, I watched it in fast forward through lots of it because there are long stretches where nothing happens. I would've fallen asleep if I hadn't.

I'd like to see what the spokesman is doing now(10 years later), and I'd like to see police and psychologist interviews and I'd like it to be shorter. I guess I'm an average impatient dude.",1168387200,2,833,4.503311258278146
