8600275,4,B00E1UJ0JM,"Very well done transfer to DVD from the original film.  Its fun to watch the original ""Our Gang"" before they became ""The Little Rascals"" on television. Recommended!",1406505600,,164,5.074074074074074
8600276,5,B00E1UJ0JM,"Five more glorious ""Our Gang"" shorts are contained herein and like the previous two it's a lot of fun. We actually get so see that not only was Mickey Daniels very expressive of face but the best actor in the gang. Fr'instance, when he's living with his rich aunt in 'High Society' there's a daring scene for 1923 when he's being bathed he steps out of the tub from the back and full frontal! That's not the best thing about this collection it was just a warning to parents that might want their little'uns to see the classic silent films from Hollywood's Golden Age and infancy. To me there's nothing like the silent era from 1918 to 1928 'til the advent of sound. Filmmakers were much more creative back then and every one gets to see that in these shorts. In volume four if there's going to be one I hope included will be the best of the silent Gang shorts ""Mary, Queen of Tots' and you'll see why these films are as clever and timeless today as they were 91 years ago. Here's to hoping for more. If you and your kids and grand kids want to laugh and have a good time together order these three silent Our Gang DVD collections well worth the money and time spent. These are the rascals that started it all the very first members of the Our Gang (Later the Little Rascals for TV)comedy troupe. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Porky and Buckwheat came much later in the talkies of the 1930's. This proves the silence is golden. And yes my favourite cutie-pie Jackie Condon is in these delightful shorts you remember the boy with the frizzy egg-beater hair if you read my previous reviews.",1378944000,4,1581,4.436426116838488
