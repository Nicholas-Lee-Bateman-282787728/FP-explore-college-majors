8025153,4,B00029X07E,"Ok, ok, I know this is kind of a hokey video,but I liked it. If you like Grandpa from the Munsters program, then you may like seeing him host a lot of monster movie trailers. Well, at least it's sort of an original idea and you can be assured that Grandpa will not be putting out any more videos. He passed away  several years ago, but his works live on. This video is good for a good rainy night when there is nothing to watch on TV. It's amusing and the price is right. They don't make classic trailers like these any more. Old black and white videos like this still can be entertaining. if you have the movies to go with them. I mean who ca resist Al Lewis as Grandpa. He's cute in a monster sort of way. Buy it on Amazon. I did.",1357603200,3,732,4.013698630136986
