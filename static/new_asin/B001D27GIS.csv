3522627,3,B001D27GIS,I'll go with the general consensus. Pretty poor acting of what could be a decent story. Pia Zadora is cute and sexy which helps.,1474329600,,128,4.375

3522642,1,B001D27GIS,The picture on the add for this movie was very misleading. Pia Zadora is a great singer but a terrible actress. There needed to be a lot more nudity and sex.,1466208000,,157,4.096774193548387

But skimming thru it, it just felt like a bad, slow, unexciting movie from the 70's about incest among country folk out in Montana or somewhere. There are definitely better things to skim thru if you happen find yourself suffering from a bit of boredom ... do not waste your time!",1463184000,,408,4.381578947368421

3522658,1,B001D27GIS,"Couldn't even make it past the scene where Keach and Pia meet. Was so completely disgusted that I immediately cut it off.

Stacy is excellent. Dated, but still plays well. A small budget film, enjoyable. You just
can't take your eyes off Pia. Her acting is so-so. It's a shame she never reached her
potential as an actress, She was never taken seriously.",1461369600,,322,4.767857142857143

Zadora has a baby, and when the father comes to fetch her to marry her, Keach finds out whether he is or is not Zadora's real father.  Great to see James Franciscus, Lois Nettleton, June Lockhart and Ed McMahon, but I thought Keach was too good for this movie.  It was a little bit of a stretch to hang in there to see the whole movie play out.",1459641600,,459,4.193181818181818

Blood does not seem to automatically keep a person from automatically being attracted to another despite the blood linkage, especially when both creatures have never met before.

I mean, ***SPOILER ALERT***, Stacey Keach thought Pia Zadora was his daughter when he fondled her!!!  It turns out he wasn't her father and when they found out they weren't related he banged her caveman style, but still, he still went for it when he thought she was his daughter so how do you give a plot like that a good rating?  Once you find out he's not related you can start critiquing the movie.  Based on how hot Pia Zadora was it is a 5 star flick, but it loses a star for sound quality!  It should lose more for sound quality but Pia steals every scene she's in and it's hard to focus on plots and what not when you see her running around in a sundress acting slutty!  Hollywood missed their opportunity in the 80's to put Bernadette Peters, Pia Zadora and Christina Applegate in a movie together where they play grandma, daughter and granddaughter at a brothel!

During every scene with Stacey Keach I kept thinking of the scene in ""Up In Smoke"" where he's on the CB talking to Cheech Marin saying, ""This is code name Hard Hat, code name Hard Hat!"" and Cheech asks, ""Did you say Lard A$$?""!  :P  LOL

Anyway, this movie is dark and disturbing.  Even though Stacey Keach didn't bang his daughter the guy who was her real father did bang her, but Stacey Keach had killed him.

Orson Welles was absolutely bizarre!  I have no idea who cast him but Grandpa Al Lewis would've been a better choice as judge!

Pia had quite a music career in the 80's.  Check out YouTube to see some of the cheesiest videos that were ever made!  She was hot and there was no incest but I never heard any of these songs in the 80's!",1455840000,,1704,4.278125

3523664,5,B001D27GIS,"I remember reading about Pia years ago. Apparently her husband (ex ?) has millions of dollars and was willing to make her a well known movie star and invest in her career. However, there was a huge backlash of those who felt she was paying her way to stardom. Her movies were panned and many critized her abilities.

Tonight, I watched Butterfly, and I thought it was riveting. Pia stars as Kady, a young woman who returns to the father she never knew and attempts to get him to steal silver from the mine he is guarding. Stacy Keech plays the father and other talented actors like James Francisco round out the cast. Pia looks gorgeous and convinced me with her acting. She has talent, looks, ability and star quality. She is totally believable as Kady, generating heat, youth and a knowing of what she needs and how to get it all at once.

The movie includes a bonus segment where the actors talk about the movie and Pia still looks awesome 26 years later. She speaks very intelligently and represents herself well.

It seems that real fame eluded Pia... and I wonder if without the money her husband put into her career and the resentment it caused, she would have accomplished her goals.

3523665,4,B001D27GIS,"Back in the 80s, Butterfly was one of those movies you always heard about, but never actually saw.  Men's magazines at the time talked a lot about it, and then there were all those Razzie awards.  Pia won a Golden Globe, but scandal struck when it was suggested that Butterfly producer and Zadora husband M. Riklis BOUGHT the award for her. (This inuendo is discussed in the commentary and in the 44-minute featurette on this DVD.) Well, what a surprise!  The movie is pretty good, in a scenery chewing, John Waters kind of way. It's short on skin, long on sleaze and NEVER BORING.  Orson Welles hams it up, Stacy Keach tries his level best to rise above the material, even Ed McMahon and June Lockhart (Mom Robinson from Lost in Space) show up.  Besides Keach, the only performance that rises above the material is Kate Nelligan, who seems to be acting in a completely different (high quality) movie.  Director Matt Cimber frequently gets a bad rap for his pictures, mainly because lots of people like to paint him as the bad guy in his marriage to Jayne Mansfield (two sides to every story, you know), but his direction here is very effective. If you like this, you should also check out another Cimber film, The Witch Who Came from the Sea, an interesting movie that does NOT feature a witch. In Butterfly, the cinematography is splendid, the Ennio Morricone soundtrack majestic, the script so-so, the acting very uneven, but if you like good B-pictures, C-pictures and D-pictures, you'll love it. Unlike another commentator, I've never been a big fan of Pia Zadora, but I'll admit: Nobody else could play the part as well. And hats off to Stacy Keach for trying so hard to take the material seriously.  Also a pat on the back to Orson Welles for his willingness to cash the check.  One thing to watch for: When Keach and Zadora go into the silver mine, the scene is shot almost identically to an early shot in Welles' own Mr. Arkadin.  But Welles would never horn in on directorial duties on somebody else's picture, would he?  Anyhow, this movie really is worth seeing.",1224633600,,2074,4.64207650273224
3523666,4,B001D27GIS,"I'm gonna get a lot of heat for this, but I'm a fan of Pia Zadora. I don't think she's the greatest actress or personality or even singer, but there's something about her that makes me giggle. Sure, she's been in a lot of questionable movies (to my count, her husband financed four of them - BUTTERFLY, FAKE-OUT, THE LONELY LADY, and VOYAGE OF THE ROCK ALIENS), but she seems to have a wicked sense of humor playing in all of them, like she's in on the joke. Maybe she was or maybe she wasn't, but FINALLY her ""first"" film, BUTTERFLY, has been officially released on DVD. I say ""officially"" because JER Films has had a bootleg DVD release on the market for several years now, mastered from the early 80s Vestron Laserdisc, a better source than a VHS tape minted from the same transfer but still a poor choice considering how blurry, blown-out, and speckly the print and noisy Laserdisc pressing were.

And now the official release from Industrial Films, a label I've never heard of, in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen from a new hi-def master, complete with a 45-minute featurette and commentary track with Pia herself! To say I'm shocked is an understatement, but I felt I should let the other dozen or so people in the world who might be interested in this release know of its quality.

The mastering isn't perfect, as there is a strange ghosting issue which appears to be from poor conversion from the hi-def master (I've seen this on some other independent DVD releases), and the audio commentary is woefully out of synchronization for the first half of the film (the film's audio is mixed in low and it reveals a large 3-4 second gap in sync). I still expected FAR worse than I got, and I'm very pleased with this disc. Even the packaging is quite nice with a slipcover that has the BUTTERFLY logo in raised red foil. The back cover gives a url, Welcome to butterfly-movie.com!, that is nothing more than a site registered for selling domain names! Weird...

DVDTown is the only review I've been able to find for the DVD so far, and I think it was a little harsh. If the reviewer only knew how poor the previous video master was...

I hope that more of Ms. Zadora's oeuvre is on its way to DVD, but from what she states in the commentary track I doubt it. ""The other movies sucked,"" she says, citing FAKE-OUT as terrible and THE LONELY LADY as being intentionally over-the-top but it ended up being, ""what it was."" No mention of VOYAGE OF THE ROCK ALIENS at all. *sigh* The face of the actual DVD has a 2008 copyright credit for Par-Par Productions, from which I can only surmise Ms. Zadora had something to do with allowing this film to be released. She seems to have a good sense of humor on her commentary track about herself and her films, but I'm not convinced she thinks putting out a special edition of THE LONELY LADY or VOYAGE OF THE ROCK ALIENS is a good idea (but Pia, if you're reading this, I think they deserve DVD releases!!!)

If you are on the fence about this release, BUY IT! Some effort obviously went into this one, and I only hope sales figures convince Ms. Zadora to let some of her other films out of the vault. No, I won't hold my breath, but I never expected this one to get released either.

She used her beauty to her advantage as a flirt and seductress. Stacy Keach and the other actors were okay but the courtroom scenes with Orson Welles were tedious, long, and boring. There was jealousy, sex, love, murder, and dramatic dialogue to keep my interest. I watched this movie primarily because this was Pia Zadora's first major role and she did okay in her performance. The ending was slightly confusing and convoluted as the different relationships were explained and resolved. I almost forgot that Pia was such a great singer. The song in the ending credits showed her prowess in that regard.

8291336,2,B001D27GIS,"Stacy Keach is a great actor who does well in all of his roles. Pia Zadora was at the time of this movie, very pleasing to the eye. This movie just happens to be slow and boring. The subject matter is also controversial in that insest is implied. Pia's character is a promiscuous and loose girl who has no problem trying to seduce the local preacher and even her own father. Or at least who we are at first led to believe is her father. The 'bathtub scene' between Stacy and Pia where he thinks she is his long lost daughter is to be sure extremely erotic. The direction is subtle and the acting superb. But even as I viewed this scene I couldn't help but be greatly creeped out. I am not a prude as I have written and published a couple of erotic novels myself but sex between a parent and a child is way beyond the realm of acceptance for me. I have a fairly large dvd collection containing some unusual movies but my conscience cannot let me include this film because of this particular subject matter. It is later revealed that Stacy's character is not her father but at the time he believed he was and he still had no problem lusting for her. In the movies defense, if you consider the time and place the storyline takes place you can try to understand how this sort of thing would not be that far fetched or even unusual. Incest has and always will be a taboo subject but if you go back in history a few thousand years, family members marrying and having children was basically normal. I view the Old Testament in the Bible as an historical account . Just consider the story of Lot and how after his wife was turned into a pillar of stone his daughters got him drunk and seduced him in order to become pregnant and continue their family. Up until the late 1800's it was fairly common for cousins to marry and have children until medical research began to find that close blood ties were related to birth defects in a small percentage of cases and most states made it illegal for family members to wed. I will admit that in one of my books the main character has sexual relationships with two of his cousins who are sisters. There is another movie based on a true account titled 'Savage Grace' in which Julianna Moore's character has fully clothed sex with her 20 something year old son who is not a particularly willing participant. I will admit that I found the scene to be extremely erotic in the heat of the moment as she straddles herself onto his lap on a couch and brings herself to climax and after dismounting she realizes he didn't finish, and she proceeds to bring him to arrival manually. The scene is directed subtly and Julianna's performance is stellar as always as she quenches her need. You feel empathy for her but once again l couldn't help but feel the creepiness of the act and did not keep the movie for my collection. Maybe I am a hypocrite to say I found these scenes erotic and then to condemn them but it is what it is. It doesn't hurt in my dismissal of these films that I just didn't find them to be very good movies.",1496534400,,3050,4.333916083916084
