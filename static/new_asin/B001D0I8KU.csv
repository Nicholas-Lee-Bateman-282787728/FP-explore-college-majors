8290802,5,B001D0I8KU,"Bob Elliott & Ray Goulding were the funniest comedians who were never comedians. Their career spanned from the 1940s to the 1980s, yet they never set foot in a nightclub, never donned tuxedos to do four shows a night in Vegas, and never played a one-night stand at Grossinger's in the Catskills. They never entered that sweaty nocturnal underworld. They did all their comedy during the day, wearing clean shirts in air-conditioned studios.

In those studios they became ""Bob and Ray"", and as a duo they fathered a unique and hilarious comic voice. Theirs is the comedy of mediocrity. Their characters aspire to greatness, gravity and grandeur, but the most any of them can manage is dry white toast. If there is a theme to Bob and Ray's comedy it is the undeniable fact of human under-achievement.

""An Award Winning Film by Bob & Ray"" is the only documentary footage ever shot of the pair working in the studio. It's 22 minutes of beautifully grainy black-and-white film, like a Drew Friedman illustration come to life. We see Bob and Ray on the microphone and off, speaking to each other in something close to the secret language of twins.

The DVD also includes clips from the ""Tonight Show"", an audio episode of ""Mary Backstayge"" accompanied by a slideshow of rare photos, and a five page essay by Keith Olbermann, which is one of the best assessments of Bob and Ray's work I've read.

At this point I should say that the casual or new fan should probably not start here. Go elsewhere first, and listen to their radio shows, their handful of now out-of-print albums (if you can find them), and bask in their astounding body of work. Then, when you have convinced yourself that there is no way these two mild-mannered men could have sat behind microphones and spun such a fully realized three-dimensional world out of thin air, come back and see the evidence for yourself. At that point this film will be like finding the Dead Sea Scrolls (the late edition, with tomorrow's pollen report).

There is a moment towards the end of the film that I find breathtaking. The pair go into their classic ""Komodo Dragon expert"" sketch, which they performed countless times before and after this recording. Perhaps out of boredom, or their famous desire to make one another laugh, they start improvising, which leads to this unexpectedly hilarious exchange: ""Ray: Do they mate in captivity? Bob: They haven't as yet."" Bob Elliott says four completely unfunny words, and says them in a completely unfunny way, yet somehow, by pausing the exact right amount and giving them the exact right inflection, makes them as funny as they could possibly be. To anyone who understands and appreciates what I just wrote, this DVD is for you.

For me, watching this film was like watching Mozart and Beethoven deciding what to order in a deli - it's just hard to believe they were ordinary men.",1304899200,3,2871,4.766599597585513
8290803,2,B001D0I8KU,"I was extremely surprised that, after a glowing review, this DVR is very short, has only fair video quality, very poor audio quality and a terrible selection of Bob & Ray skits. The publicity suggests that it's typical of their work. I listened to them dsily for many years on a local AM station. (WTIC: The Bob Steele Show)
I feel that this disc is extremely overpriced since there are only two short segments (done on The Johnny Carson Show) that actually represent their humor; the others do not.",1255478400,11,499,4.617977528089888

8290806,4,B001D0I8KU,"We will never see the likes of these two wonderful guys again.  Their deadpan, absurd humor manages to be both mundane and other worldly.  I think they started or refined  the comedy of inertia.  Their characters in skits never seem to get anywhere or accomplish anything,  and the not getting there is hilarious.  I'm afraid a lot of the younger generation won't get their type of humor,  which doesn't rely on shock or vulgarity,  but that is their genius.  To me, they have been like two demented uncles that I love to just listen to.  I wish there was a lot more video of them on this DVD,  but the final piece is a delight to see them at work.  I love these guys.",1238889600,,668,4.298387096774194
8290807,4,B001D0I8KU,"I enjoyed seeing and having this film, as I love all things Bob & Ray. At the same time, I guess I expected something zanier, totally forgetting the time period in which it was produced. Sometimes, ""behind the scenes"" type films a bit duller than fans would desire. Overall, an enjoyable DVD, but don't push your expectations higher than is needed.",1233532800,5,348,4.721311475409836

Very well done film.",1218499200,7,183,4.870967741935484
