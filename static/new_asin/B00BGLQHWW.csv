5619703,5,B00BGLQHWW,"I have a ton of WWII docs and am not easily impressed with new ones that come out but boy was this show a find. What it does best and better than any other WWII show I've seen, is really give you a 'global view' of the multiple conflicts taking place on several continents at once. You get a better understanding of how vast the conflict was with war happening on multiple fronts at the same time. The ""From Space"" in the title isn't so much about seeing the 'details' of battles 5 miles up in the sky, its about getting a real sense what they mean when they say ""World War"". Added to the great graphics is crisp narration, and a fast paced show and you get proof that indeed 'new shows' about a war that ended nearly 60 years ago are still possible.",1376006400,2,750,4.179310344827586
5619704,5,B00BGLQHWW,"Rather than dwell on the ""politics and hardware"" of World War II, this excellent British-made documentary tries to uncover the ""whys"".  After watching it, you can almost still hear the echo of what may have been America's finest moment on the world stage as she mustered up the Arsenal of Democracy to help defeat two evil empires.  You will know more about WW II than you ever did before, and will leave you with a newfound respect for America's ideals.  This documentary should be seen and discussed by every high school and college history class. A very, very powerful piece of work .....",1370217600,17,591,4.718446601941747
5619705,5,B00BGLQHWW,"I saw this on cable first and was extremely impressed. I had to have it when it came out to show to friends and family. This is how you do historical documentaries! I've always had a natural interest in history, but never really developed it in high school or college beyond the classes that I took. If there were presentations like this back then, who knows. This should definitely be pitched to high schools and colleges.

The pacing and weaving together of the soundtrack, narration, commentators, graphical re-enactments and fact presentations, fluid top-down perspectives around the world, I've never seen it flow so impressively and with such high quality as here.

I would love to see this kind of effort put into other historical topics and conflicts, from broad overviews down to in-depth .",1369872000,4,799,4.955223880597015

5619754,4,B00BGLQHWW,"This is a hard documentary to review, but I will provide what I saw and how I felt while watching this 2 hour documentary. One important aspect is that its almost about the US entry of WWII from Pearl Harbour, few glimpses during the 2 hours take us back to Poland, South East Asia, Britain or the Russian Front but nothing that really shows what was happening. A Better Title would be US Involvement is WWII from Space.  I do understand that WWII had many key events and campaigns on various fronts and going through each one of them is almost impossible as each outcome had a direct or indirect impact on the whole war.  Think of this documentary as a Summary or Review after watching World at War, Midway, Pacific, Enemy at the Gates, Saving Private Ryan, Battle of England and various other Documentaries and Movies including some of the German Ones such as Stalingrad. Watching it gave me a Top View of the Events that help see that picture as a whole. I would like to give it 3 Stars for the good effort but failing to be interesting. But I choose a 4 because its worth watching even once.
- Pros : Top View Summary, 6 Years of War in 2 Hours, Effective
- Cons: Missing Most of Non-US involvement. Could be a bit Deeper.",1469923200,5,1226,4.37280701754386

I don't have enough historical knowledge of World War II, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the information presented. That being said, this documentary was fascinating! I loved how WWII was presented ""from space."" It made the devastating accounts of WWII that much more compelling. I would watch this again.

5619765,5,B00BGLQHWW,"Excellent depiction of WWII. The ""From Space"" part refers to the view of Earth that is used when referencing any particular point or area of conflict.

We owe so much to so many.",1459987200,,377,4.641791044776119
5619776,4,B00BGLQHWW,This program discusses a number of important events of the conflict showing how the battles looked from space as the various contenders jostled for position and resulted in eventual victory for one side. it makes you wonder if the various officers in charge could see enemy dispositions for these battles from the view of space how they may have acted,1459123200,,351,4.866666666666666
5619777,3,B00BGLQHWW,"""from space"" just means an overhead view of a world map with lines being drawn from one spot to another.

It was a very good overview of the war in relevant large scale politics and economy, and the limits and the actual industrial capabilities that comes in to play. This documentary definitely introduces new perspectives of a war, the reason for the alliance. Of course its objectives is to teach the big ideas. not individual stories and heroism. I think its very game-like, visualizing the logistics, mobilization and casualty ratio.

Its viewpoint is definitely from the American side. It explores how crazy humans will spend billions of dollars, generations and power to build great machines and structures and proceed to murder each other with it. Beautiful. Must watch 10/10",1445731200,,749,5.139344262295082

5619791,5,B00BGLQHWW,"An enlightening (and admittedly entertaining) recounting of the events that led to WWII and throughout, told in a very different way: from a sky-high global perspective. Utterly engaging. It was fascinating to watch Hitler's, America's, and the Russian Armies move across Europe and the Pacific from miles above the earth--a vivid depiction of the disturbingly vast extent of the war and of Hitler's ambitions. This would be a great introduction for someone who wanted to get a broad view of the WWII story.",1444953600,,507,5.120481927710843

5619796,5,B00BGLQHWW,"Saw this movie on Netflix last week. I wasn't expecting much, but it blew me away! I learned things that I never knew before, like that FDR traded our help to England for all of their west Pacific bases.
Who knew in the world of Obama's vacant redlines, that a President actually got something in negotiations, with our FRIENDS, not even enemys!

Every school in America should show this movie so that our youth can understand what freedom costs.",1440979200,,446,4.6455696202531644

5619799,5,B00BGLQHWW,"Turning points of WWII are covered in this new show, with an emphasis on the technological edge that was either held by the Allies or the Axis powers.  Air power figures prominently, and the US achieved air superiority fairly early.  The rise of American industry, the Arsenal of Democracy, supported by large numbers of American buying war bonds is well described.  The producers' also seem to believe that advanced technology and access to oil resources were determinative in the war's results, which is mostly true.
The show provides a panoramic view of WWII and naturally glosses over many aspects of the war.  More focused documentary films can be found on Netflix, Amazon, and public libraries.  For example, ""War of the Century:  When Hitler Fought Stalin"" has incredibly in-depth interviews and footage about WWII in Eastern Europe.  German leaders mistakenly believed they needed more land, and negotiated with the Soviet Union for the partition of Poland and the Baltic States.  That particular history is well covered in the new film ""The Soviet Story"" by Edvins Snore.",1439424000,,1080,5.131428571428572

I have tried many projects but this is definitely been the best. they all get engaged.. high school boys AND girls! At the end of the video, I ask them in their opinion which country won? This can be taken in many ways. I try to leave it open so there are many correct answers! Only thing I don't like is that it is mostly from the American side for my World History class but no big deal we talk about that before the video.",1438128000,5,524,3.861111111111111

Maybe there could be, but this is the best documentary I've seen that gave a concise, comprehensive overview of the the events leading up to WWII, how it progressed, and visually showed from an aerial perspective how everything played out and why. Being that I am a ""visual learner"" this truly was a ""one picture is worth a thousand words"" educational experience. I highly recommend watching it.

5619844,5,B00BGLQHWW,"Not really from space, but a good history lesson on the actual phases of the war. Seems to focus a lot on maps and expansion, etc. For me, that was enjoyable. I've recently watched other WWII documentaries that bring you into the battle which is great - this one is a little bit more macro and would serve as a good general history lesson. For that reason I'm giving it 5 stars. Great companion to another more detailed documentary.",1403395200,,432,4.481012658227848
5619845,5,B00BGLQHWW,"I have many WW 2 documentaries, this is well made and won't put you to sleep.... far from boring! While no DVD can cover every single battle this does the best job of delivering the essentials on one DVD in only 2 hours! This is better than my 7 volume 22 hours multi DVD set!
It effectively covers BOTH European and Pacific theaters....It's the best for the price!
I really enjoy it!",1401235200,,384,4.347222222222222
5619846,1,B00BGLQHWW,"I've given this ""documentary"" a one star rating just out of courtesy, but it really deserves none.  If this is the level of scholarship provided by the History Channel, then they should stick to icy roads and pawn shops.  I was about to buy this dvd recently until I saw it on the Military Channel.  I couldn't believe what my ears were hearing.  At the section on the Battle of Midway the narrator states that the US fleet approached the Japanese fleet from the northwest to avoid ""Japanese radar.""  What?  Since when?  If the IJN had radar their carriers would never have been caught flat-footed by McClusky's SBD's. Also, they state US had FOUR aircraft carriers at Midway.  Really? Since when?  Yorktown, Enterprise, Hornet; that makes three. Lastly, the scholars on the program perpetuate the myth that the Japanese carriers were crowded with aircraft ready for launching.  Bull!  They obviously had not read Shattered Sword. I suggest they do so before they do another documentary about Midway.",1395360000,9,1000,4.92814371257485
5619847,5,B00BGLQHWW,Used this video to help teach high school WW II history.  Best video I've found to keep students interested and engaged.,1393977600,,120,4.714285714285714
5619848,5,B00BGLQHWW,"This new and different way to present the history of WWII certainly makes it highly entertaining and very interesting. The narrator keeps ones intrigued by going into detail on the many different battles and events. The ""birds eye view"" of the war really allows one to see just how massive this event was and how all the battles moved across the land. Very pleased when I saw this documentary, just wish it was longer because it is so good. Worth buying.",1388793600,,454,4.617283950617284
5619849,5,B00BGLQHWW,"As an educator, I think this is a fabulous resource for a student who is studying WWII.  I haven't seen a better overall presentation that a student can sit down and learn from in a way he/she will retain the information.

As a lifelong learner myself, I find this to be one of the best portrayals of the war I've seen.  Very nicely done.",1387324800,20,338,4.25

5619851,5,B00BGLQHWW,"I was pleasantly surprised how the producers of this production gave a new perspective of WW2.  I didn't know what to expect just looking at the title, but yes, this is definitely a five star plus video to own.  it easily put the entire concept of WW2 into easy, understandable viewing.  This would be excellent at the high school level to bring the war into understanding, on the war strategy of the war and how the Allies claimed victory.  Did I say high school level?  Well, in fact, adults will love this presentation also.  As a student of WW2 history, this production brought insight and  new information I'd not hear of before.  I totally recommend this to any history bluff and student.",1386374400,32,694,4.631147540983607
5619852,5,B00BGLQHWW,AWESOME documentary. Learned so much about the war and it's very entertaining. Simply great. Hope they do one for Vietnam.,1384300800,,122,5.15
5619853,5,B00BGLQHWW,"I have been watching documentaries and reading books about WW2 for over 15 years. I know a good amount about the War but am always hungry to learn more. This program did an amazing job of providing a high level overview of the entire war in a way I have not seen done. Additionally information and insights new to me became apparent due to how the program was structured. For example, I realized how Germans need for oil drove their invasion of the USSR and the strategic decisions made thereafter. Additionally, this program did an excellent job of showcasing the brutality and futility of fighting the Japanese in the Pacific theater with ground troops and the necessity of nuclear bombs. I am going to buy a copy of this so I can show it to my children when they get older.",1381017600,22,776,4.51063829787234
5619854,5,B00BGLQHWW,What a great documentary on WW2 ... Certainly the best war documentary that I have ever seen. This is a must watch.,1380931200,,115,4.2727272727272725
5619855,3,B00BGLQHWW,"I bought this disk based on previous 4-reviews but quickly realized after viewing it that a more accurate and critical review of this disk is needed.

Essentially, this is a global overview of WWII from the point of view of the US side but sadly missing many salient points of the war (e.g, in the Pacific, the Solomons Campaign including Guadalcanal was omitted while in Europe, the Italian campaign, Operation Market Garden).

Moreover, it also contains many errors in its CGI video (e.g., U-boats firing torpedoes that detonate under the keel of a surface ship, breaking the ship's back and sinking it - these torpedoes are of modern design; Russian SU-152 self-propelled gun landing on the beaches in Normandy during D-Day in Operation Overlord).

Perhaps it is understandable that there will be major and important gaps in the efforts to provide the overview of WWII due to the scope of the subject and the limited time available in a single disk but the glaring errors in the CGI as well as in the commentary of some of those  interviewed could easily be avoided by someone with a modicum of understanding of WWII.

Consider this disk as nothing more than a cursory and incomplete overview of the war from the point of view of the US with some nice CGIs and the disk will be passable.  Taking it as anything more serious than that would be a mistake.",1377129600,37,1356,4.70042194092827
8568229,5,B00BGLQHWW,"Some critics gave this documentary unfavorable reviews, but as a history buff I thoroughly enjoyed it and even learned several fairly significant things I didn't know (like what really finished the British Empire), and was reminded of a few I had forgotten.  WWII is big and sprawling, and it is nice to see this 60,000 ft. view (pun intended) that hits the high points and explains the strategies.  With its relatively short runtime, I was able to get my head around the whole war in one sitting, which is not an easy thing to accomplish.  Its also a great way to teach your teenagers about the war.  The presentation is interesting and the pace is fast enough that they shouldn't get bored.",1530057600,,692,4.647540983606557
