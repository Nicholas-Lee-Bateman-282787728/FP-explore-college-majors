2509503,3,B000E8N9DI,A corny old Hollywood B movie with a very loose plot.  Ok to fill time with if you don't get bored too easily.,1363219200,,110,3.782608695652174
2509504,1,B000E8N9DI,This video was of such poor quality we could nt continue to watch it. Very dissapointing. This is not the first movie we have been unable to watch due to poor quality.,1361923200,,167,4.25
2509505,5,B000E8N9DI,A very funny movie. Brings back a lot of good memores.  The days of just plain fun movies are still alive.,1361145600,2,106,4.0476190476190474
2509506,5,B000E8N9DI,I bought this for a friend who lives in an Assisted Living Facility.  It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition.  She loves the movie.,1360972800,2,151,4.769230769230769
2509507,2,B000E8N9DI,"I'd never heard of this and watched for Ginger. If this is not one of the worst films of her career, I don't know what is. Pretty awful!",1356220800,,136,3.892857142857143
2509508,2,B000E8N9DI,"THE GROOM WORE SPURS was for decades one of Ginger Rogers' most obscure movies. Ginger herself frequently mentioned it as one of her worst. Little seen since it's original release, in the last decade however it apparently has gone into public domain (it was an independent production theatrically released by Universal) and as a result has shown up in cheapie DVD issues by several companies. I own the Alpha release, the print quality of which is good but not great. Seeing the film at long last, one can confirm Ginger Rogers was indeed correct.

This is a silly, wafer-thin comedy about a cowboy movie star who doesn't like horses (Jack Carson) and his entanglement with a lady lawyer (Ginger) whom he marries on impulse in Las Vegas. Things get off to a bad start with an awful title song. There are occasionally some good laughs but much of the script and certainly the direction and editing leave a lot to be desired. The direction is quite bad with many wider shots with virtually no closeups or reaction shots edited in to them, rather inexplicable given director Richard Whorf had previously directed the well-regarded TIL CLOUDS ROLL BY and CHAMPAGNE FOR CAESAR and would later helm several excellent episodes of TV'S THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.The film turns into a lame murder mystery the last fifteen minutes of the film complete with an absurd resolution.

One suspects Ginger was initially attracted to the script for a chance to play sharp lawyer, certainly a change of pace for her. At age 40 she evokes a mature glamour and is still quite a looker but she and Carson are mismatched, never seeming genuinely attracted to each other, but then the script doesn't help make their ""romance"" seem credible either.

Joan Davis as Ginger's pal is as usual sometimes funny, sometimes working too hard to be funny. Of note the unbilled young actor playing Joan's alarm-clocking fixing beau is Ross Hunter, a failed heartthrob of 1940's ""B"" movies in his last acting gig just before he launched an extremely successful career as a film producer.",1254268800,5,2049,4.865329512893982
2509509,2,B000E8N9DI,"Give Ginger Rogers and Jack Carson a lot of credit for trying to make the inferior material they've been saddled with here seem funnier than it actually is. But talented performers can only coast so long on integrity and good intentions before it becomes apparent that there's nothing particularly amusing or interesting about this uninspired comedy-mystery. It's dispiriting to see this pair get suffocated by the film's lackluster script and direction. Among the squandered assets, the reliable Joan Davis is wasted in a minor supporting role as Ginger's gal pal.

Carson is perfectly cast as an affable windbag and teaming him with Ginger's pragmatic character should have been a winning combination. If only they had been given a vehicle worthy of their abilities. Instead, we get a series of silly comedy scenes, with a lackluster murder-mystery plot tossed in. Even the climactic sequence involving a runaway airplane falls flat.

The print quality of this Alpha Video disc is mediocre at best, which no doubt impacted my unenthused assessment. However, even a pristine, digitally-restored copy wouldn't have altered my opinion ... it would have made things easier on the eyes, but not on the funny bone.

My advice is to take a pass on this one, even if you're a fan of these stars. There are other, superior Ginger Rogers comedies available -- for instance, check out THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR (1941). As for Jack Carson, let's hope that his hilarious slapstick farce THE GOOD HUMOR MAN (1950) gets released on DVD in the near future.",1219622400,7,1540,5.0078125
2509510,5,B000E8N9DI,"I had been looking for this old movie for a long time, thus I was very pleased to receive it. It's corny, of course, but that's the way movies were back then. This 1951 movie stars Ginger Rogers and Jack Carson. Pure nostalgia.",1154649600,,227,4.3023255813953485

2509552,3,B000E8N9DI,"Not a great comedy, but it certainly had it's humorous moments.  Great for Ginger Rodgers fans.",1458345600,,95,4.9375
2509553,2,B000E8N9DI,"This film is innocent but lame, well beneath the talents of its two stars.  We saw it through to the end, but wouldn't watch it again.",1458000000,,134,4.153846153846154

2509556,3,B000E8N9DI,This movie was just ok.  It just didn't keep my interest.,1442966400,,57,4.181818181818182

2509582,4,B000E8N9DI,"A different way of looking at Ginger Rogers and Jack Carson, Jack is kind of a jerk in this movie, my son said, ""Mom did he really say that and did they really treat women that way back then""? He is 31. But it is entertaining and fun.",1417564800,,234,3.8958333333333335

2509584,5,B000E8N9DI,It was really good.,1412121600,,19,4.0
2509585,2,B000E8N9DI,Watched because I wanted to see Joan Davis.  I was ready for the typical romantic comedy of the 40s & 50s but this one didn't measure up.  Ginger Rogers should have turned down this script.  Not enough Joan Davis and her brand of comedy.,1411689600,,237,4.340909090909091
2509586,3,B000E8N9DI,"Buy this if you are a fan of Ginger Rogers, but otherwise give it a miss. The quality is not great, in fact I began to believe I might need to change my glasses. Such a shame as I am a fan of Ginger's and however awful a script I would have liked to have seen her in sharp detail instead of a blurry image of her and the rest of the cast. Here we go, the story could have been good with a little more attention to reality, yes I know it is meant to be a comedy, but really did it mean to be this silly. Ginger deserved better as a class comedienne and actress, then she did her best with what she was asked to do. This kind of slapstick was beneath her. A case of not many good roles for females of her class then.
Earlier up on a former comment, there was mention of her maturity. Well considering she had been in show business since she was fourteen and was now in her early forties, Ginger was in this movie as beautiful as ever. I believe she made a mistake in appearing in this lightly fluffy film, but then we can all make mistakes in life and Ginger was no exception in this.  Watch a couple of her movies made after this, she surely underlined her talent in those. Look them up they are worth buying.",1409616000,,1208,4.012448132780083

2509588,4,B000E8N9DI,It was cute and a happy ending.  My husband also enjoyed it.,1407196800,,60,4.0
2509589,4,B000E8N9DI,"This is a crazy romantic comedy, that really doesn't have much to do with cowboys and spurs. If you like Ginger Rogers as an actress you'll enjoy it.",1406851200,,149,4.357142857142857
2509590,3,B000E8N9DI,"I am a fan of colorizing movies because it actually makes someone go back and fix the graininess of a Black and white movie.
The acting and plot in this movie are just OK.  The lack of detail visible in Black and White is a  big detraction for me.
Remaster it and put it in color would probably help quite a bit.",1406505600,,312,4.016129032258065
2509591,4,B000E8N9DI,It was ok and it was fun to see the stars from many years ago.,1406160000,,62,3.2
2509592,2,B000E8N9DI,"Is it me or is Ginger Rogers showing her age here ? I've seen her play the same character so many times, I'm wondering if she's not an actress, she's just herself ! Unbelievable plot : educated serious woman gets' star struck by big lug fake cowboy actor who uses her to get out of a financial difficulty. He truly seems smitten with her looks, but has no moral conscience. He drinks to excess, womanizes & lies about who he is....what a catch ? Yes, a man just needs the right woman and he will reform himself into husband material....there is no romance here, only stupid people acting stupid",1405296000,,594,4.458715596330276
2509593,3,B000E8N9DI,"Ever predictable, but Ginger Rogers is so classy-it's one you're not sorry you watched, but you don't need to see it again.",1400803200,,123,4.636363636363637
2509594,1,B000E8N9DI,"This is too vilely inept and desperately unfunny to warrant anyone's attention, even diehard fans of the deliberately unappealing cast. Its sole redeeming virtues are accidental and trivial; a quickie stock footage montage showing that wicked fleshpot Las Vegas ca. 1950, and the final (quickie) acting appearance of Ross Hunter before he moved on to producing the Douglas Sirk masterpieces. Mr. Hunter, it pains me to say, steals the show.",1398729600,,440,5.3

2509596,3,B000E8N9DI,"This was slighly better than boring. The story was really rather non-plausable--and smart female attorney with a bad case of movie star worship, marries they guy on less than 24 hours acquaintance only to find out he's a complete phoney, more interested in her connections than in her.",1391299200,,285,4.958333333333333
2509597,3,B000E8N9DI,Fun to watch. Good to have classic movies available for good clean watching. Worth being a prime member to watch all these.,1388793600,2,123,4.636363636363637
2509598,3,B000E8N9DI,I think Ginger Rogers must have regretted this film...not really much to compliment but okay as a time killer - I've seen much worse movies...,1385769600,,142,4.72
2509599,4,B000E8N9DI,"Can not believe that there was a Ginger Rogers movie that I had never seen before!  Always a joy to watch her talent and of course Jack Carson is good for fun times and  happy laughs.  Lighthearted movie and will leave you feeling good but I would comment that even though it is an OLD black and white movie,  I found it often too dark (color/lighting, not mood) which was disappointing when so much of the film was hard to see. Still lots of fun despite that little annoyance.",1375142400,,477,4.325842696629214
