8615277,3,B00FFK9L6E,"People at a Los Angeles advertising firm are winning clients, getting promoted, and making money -- while losing their souls in the process. Literally. And when it's time to pay the price, the ""soul killer"" appears to deliver their souls to the devil.

Nice girl Natalie has been working hard for years, trying to get ahead, and it didn't work. So she turns bad girl, intent on sleeping her way to the top. That's when she starts seeing the Soul Killer killing her co-workers. Has she time to reform her ways -- and stop the Soul Killer -- before it's too late?

This is the director's first feature film, and it shows. The script lacks subtext. The dialog is obvious and ""on the nose."" Characters are always telling us their beliefs, motivations, intentions, and frustrations. Some of that dialog could have been trimmed, and what's left, made more oblique. More showing, less telling.

The pace should be quicker, especially in the exchange of dialog. Some of the talkier scenes drag, the conversations drawn out. Actors are savoring moments that need not be savored. With a tighter script, and quicker pacing, the film could be 15 minutes shorter, give or take, without losing anything.

The no-name cast is decent, neither exceptional nor terrible. Mostly youngish, low-budget actors, still learning their craft. Some are a bit wooden (the cop/love interest is wooden and bland), while others chew a bit of scenery.

The special effects aren't too slick. The Soul Killer swings his blade, his victims go ""Ah!"" then slump to the ground.

The theology is a curious mix of soft/feel-good Christianity and New Agey occultism. One character, who I'd interpret as a ""good witch,"" talks about ""sin"" and the ""devil,"" and helps Natalie fight the Soul Killer.

One reviewer said that SOUL KILLER has a ""kickass female lead."" No, not really. Natalie only starts kicking ass at the very end, and only for a few minutes.

I don't need gore, but SOUL KILLER is not scary in any way. Yet its workplace drama, bolstered by some meaty themes, held my interest. Natalie is both pretty and likeable, and struggles to do the right thing in a supernatural setting.

Because I'm a fan of micro-budgeted horror films, I enjoyed SOUL KILLER despite its flaws, so I'll give it a generous 3 stars.",1382745600,,2275,4.827763496143959
8615278,5,B00FFK9L6E,"This movie fits a really neat genre, it's suspenseful without being gory/violent. Make no mistake, it is very much a tale for ""grownups"" but it doesn't pander to the gross-out factor. It has suspense and action and a witty humor to it - similar to Buffy-style - and it has a kickass female in the lead role! It has a fun sci-fi/mystical element that keeps you guessing and it has a moral center as well. It's just plain fun.",1381449600,,424,4.379746835443038
