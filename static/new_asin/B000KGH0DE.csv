8156775,5,B000KGH0DE,My boyfriend brought this for me and I was thrilled. I love old classic silent movies and Gloria Swanson is my favorite from the early movie era.,1524441600,,145,4.407407407407407
8156776,2,B000KGH0DE,"This compilation has poor video quality and - the largest sin of all - it leaves out the final reel of ""Don't Change Your Husband""! If you are a silent film lover, leave this mess alone and buy the higher quality DVD's which are available for most of the titles. Now I still have to buy a copy of ""Don't Change Your Husband"" to get the entire film.",1237593600,10,348,4.132352941176471
8156777,5,B000KGH0DE,"i initially overlooked this dvd because i had almost a dozen others i wanted to study that seemed much more entertaining. so today i happend to have a chance to really pay attn. to the wonderful dvd and am i glad i did!  the crispness of the movie is simply astounding and male and female really captivated me. I RECOMEND THIS ONE HIGHLY! so nice to see how people looked and acted in a gentler time.  horse and buggy looking autos and slave like servents.  GRANTED IT ALL CAME CRASHING DOWN SOON ENOUGH. the depression, the horrid antisemitism, the awfulness of the times to come as well as the realities of the poor and the darker complected citizens, isn't even hinted at in these silent flicks.
i guess i'm lucky i cleaned my bedroom and dug this one out.
simply had to share my delight!
I AM ALSO GLAD THAT THIS WORLD HAS CHANGED-I WOULD'VE HATED THE AWFUL APARTIDE THIS COUNTRY HAD. so many people were very trapped and excluded by society back in the day.",1200960000,2,962,4.454545454545454
8156778,4,B000KGH0DE,"Containing 10 films, 6 of them features, this set could be a nice way for someone on a shoestring budget to start adding some Gloria Swanson films to one's library.  The shorts, 'His New Job' (1915, and really a Chaplin film), 'The Danger Girl' (1916), 'Teddy at the Throttle' (1917), and 'The Sultan's Wife' (1917), are a rather interesting change of pace for the average viewer who is probably only familiar with her work in later features.  Gloria actually got started acting in Keystone comedies, and displays great comedic timing and ability in these shorts.  They also show her paired with Bobby Vernon, an actor who now seems to be largely forgotten, and with her then-husband Wallace Beery in 'Teddy at the Throttle.'  These shorts show that she wasn't just adept in dramatic acting.  The depiction of India and Indians in 'The Sultan's Wife' is highly inaccurate, but one shouldn't expect too much in the way of cultural sensitivity and awareness in anything from 1917.

Four of the features are ones she made with Cecil B. DeMille, 'Male and Female' (1919), 'Don't Change Your Husband' (1919), 'Why Change Your Wife?' (1920), and 'The Affairs of Anatol' (1921).  A lot of people think of DeMille as a director of over the top Biblical stories, decadent indulgent extravagant films, and preachy morality plays, but he actually did more films like these, light-hearted morality plays and comedies about romance and domestic life.  While there are some of his trademark touches of decadence and over the top scenes, such as the Babylonian dream scenes in 'Male and Female,' overall they're enjoyable, believable, and down to earth.  Gloria had some great co-stars in these films too, such as Wallace Reid, Thomas Meighan, Bebe Daniels, and Theodore Roberts.  'Sadie Thompson' (1928), believed by many to be one of her greatest silent roles, is another highlight of this set, though sadly the final reel is lost, making the remainder of the story be told through stills and explanatory intertitles, and just when the dramatic intensity was at its height and leading up to what was a really riveting final reel, too.  'Indiscreet' (1931) is a typical early talkie, with very still cameras, not a lot of action shots, and below-par audio quality.  It's an interesting way to kill time, but not really that memorable or great.  It's also not a good sign when the villain is a lot more interesting and believable than the supposed good guy.  Still, Gloria does a great job with the mediocre material, and does it all--singing, comedy, emoting, and dramatic moments.  Included as bonus features are a short documentary, a 'Hollywood Biography' episode, interviews, and a newsreel consisting of clips of her films and non-acting footage.

In spite of the good points, though, this is a budget set, and when it comes to technology, one generally gets what one pays for.  After viewing the entire set, one can probably guess why so many great films were issued for such an unbelievably generous price.  Most of them have already been issued on DVD, only the versions here do not have the same nice prints or custom-made soundtracks.  For example, this version of 'The Affairs of Anatol' doesn't have the beautiful scenes near the end that are in early Technicolor on the official DVD.  Finding out about how Passport Video has a history of pirating the hard work of other people makes one wonder if perhaps these too weren't taken without permission.  There's also a bug on the lower right-hand corner of the screen, and while it can be tuned out periodically because it's a rather transparent white against black and white images, it's still annoying and distracting, and has no reason to be there.  One expects that when watching something taped off of the tv, not on a supposedly professional DVD!  Still, this is a really good price for someone who might not be able to afford all of the individual higher-quality DVDs that have these films, and it's not like one should expect a really high standard from such a budget boxed set.",1189641600,29,4032,4.8883994126284875

I have hundreds of pieces of Swanson Memorabilia and I am delighted to have been able to buy this set for the price of a cup of coffee at Starbucks. Thank you always Gloria for creating the role of Norma Desmond......All my love always......Dennis
