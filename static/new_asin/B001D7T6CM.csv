3527312,5,B001D7T6CM,Written by a newcomer. Excellent and completely relatable. Such a sad commentary on violence and society.

3527321,4,B001D7T6CM,"Really good movie.  Slow-building intensity, gets really good, I thought and has an unexpected ending. If you ever saw ""The Vanishing,"" with Jeff Bridges, the subject matter is much different, but it is definitely on that level.",1487808000,,228,5.162162162162162
3527322,5,B001D7T6CM,"""Arlington Road"" with Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins is an only slightly tacky movie.  Everything about it basically screams: ""The world is being dissolved and destroyed by caucasian terrorists and they are very serious.""  That's the plot, in essentials: Jeff Bridges is a man who had a wife working in the FBI--killed, incidentally, by a brainwashed white power lady--and he is sort of the opposite of anyone who could work in any militia or institution.  He is a kind guy who sees the threat but does not act in time: every compassionate instinct he has is preyed upon by fellow terrorist neighbor Tim Robbins.

Tim Robbins almost gives a good performance but because he is a sort of Upper West Manhattan yuppie liberal he never talks the way these guys actually talk: to do that would be to stain his immaculate image.  Jeff Bridges is more believable as a baby boomer who is still idealistic.

Every piece of the dialogue could be applied to the invasion of Iraq, the Twin Towers; it is almost perfect.  I think Ann Coulter plagiarized some of what Tim Robbins says.  Watching this now is something.",1486857600,,1101,4.727748691099476

3527330,3,B001D7T6CM,"Another fine film where the good guys don't turn things around, and a good introduction to the atmospheric skills of composer Badalamenti (also composed the score for Lynch's Mulholland Drive, and others)

However implausible some of the plot points/twists are in this film, especially those that evolve as the story approaches its ironic conclusion, the very end scenes play out as a template for our paranoid friends, who see potentially plausible conspiracies at much higher levels.

Instead of the mentally deranged, ultra patriot whack job terrorists who have an axe to grind with government agencies (as portrayed by Robbins), or the home grown lunatic, under-educated neo-nazi bomb plotters, just think on the international banker/""power broker"", war monger level (who of course, could conceivably finance and inspire much larger operations) and you're having much more fun with it.

Admittedly, I did not see the end coming; very cleverly done",1476144000,,951,5.412162162162162

3527332,5,B001D7T6CM,I agree. This movie is suspenseful and had me glued to the Tv. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. The plot is great.  I've always been a fan of Jeff Bridges so I knew it would be good. This movie does not get old. I went to see it at the movies and after watching it again it was just as good watching it now. It's similar to The Ruby Ridge story if you're familiar with that. A must see!!,1474070400,,401,3.8313253012048194

3527338,5,B001D7T6CM,"Disturbing but Realistic Premise - A Startling Ending.  I just recently discovered this movie after taking an acting class with one of the actors in this movie.  Being a Tim Robbins fan, I was surprised at the role that he plays in this movie.  Joan Cusack is fantastic and scary in a role that is a departure from what she usually does.  After years in the ""civilian military complex,"" I totally bought into the premise of this movie and I realized the ending of this movie about the same time Jeff Bridges does - and it is tragic.  There is a very disturbing opening sequence with a young boy walking down an empty neighborhood street that sets the tone - nothing at all is what it appears to be.  Released in 1999 and given the nature of what is happening all over the world right now, this movie is still timely in the message.  You never really know who is living right next door to you.",1471824000,,892,4.337349397590361

3527342,4,B001D7T6CM,"This movie offers a rather poignant question:  what if your next-door-neighbor was a Timothy McVeigh type?  What if you knew he was a terrorist who was up to no good, but you didn't have any proof of nefarious or insidious activities?  What would you do?  How far would you go to stop him?  Such are the questions posed by this movie.

Jeff Bridges plays a professor of history @ George Washington university.  He has an obsession with terrorist acts as his late wife died in an F.B.I. raid gone bad (similar to the infamous incident at Ruby Ridge).  He has friends @ the F.B.I. who were co-workers of his late wife.  Tim Robbins plays our friendly neighborhood terrorist.....or is he?  Something is just not quite right about his story.....but it's unclear what he is up to.

This is a thoughtful movie.....some of it a wee bit far fetched, but that's OK.  If you like suspense / thrillers, then it's certainly worth your while to pay a visit to Arlington Road!",1470268800,,962,4.594117647058823

3527362,5,B001D7T6CM,"Honestly, I can't believe I got this combo for less than $7 and shipped to my door for free.  I mean, it doesn't get too much better than that.  This review is for both the movies and not necessarily for the packaging or the special features the movies came with.  I once watched Arlington Road when it first came out on video (I actually watched it on VHS, that's how long ago it was). It was not a good night to watch it on (Christmas Eve) but it stayed with me for a really long time.  What a thriller.

I've never seen Devil in a Blue Dress but I've always wanted to.  I was determined to buy Arlington Road to show my husband, so I was really happy to see this combined with another movie that I actually have always wanted to see.  It's definitely not one of the more well known movies of Denzel Washington though it's very well done.  Great direction and acting.  The storyline is fabulous, too.  Apparently this launched Don Cheadle (I was not aware of this).  Have to say: Cheadle was dead on fabulous for his ruthless character in this film.

I highly recommend this combo pack - especially if you've never seen either movies before and you like thrillers.  I was very happy with my purchase.",1455062400,,1202,4.36036036036036

3527373,4,B001D7T6CM,"A good thriller but with a gaping hole in the heart of the script

SUMMARY: A political thriller about a professor who gets suspicious about his neighbors. He thinks the neighbors might be terrorists in disguise, planning to strike against the United States. Well, could your neighbors be the same folks who blew up the U.S. federal building in a large Midwestern metropolis? Are they intending to do even worse right in the heart of the nations capital?

*** Do you know?

Do you know who the heck your friendly neighbors (the husband played by Tim Robbins) actually are?

Could your neighbors be the same folks who blew up the U.S. federal building in a large Midwestern metropolis? Are they intending to do even worse right in the heart of the nations capital?

What should you do as a citizen and a neighbor?

*** The Deadly Dilemma

What are the risks of reporting your neighbors to law enforcement on a gut feeling and launching a series of irretraceable events, versus, sitting on your suspicion, playing it safe and erring on the side of caution?

Thats the fatal dilemma at the heart of this tight gripping thriller.

*** The Central Question

The central question is, can a history professor (Jeff Bridges), who has lost his FBI agent wife in a bust that went very wrong a few years back, save us from an impending disaster?

Ehren Krugers script is directed by Mark Pellington.

*** WARNING -- Plot Points revealed ***

*** Ending with a Twist

This political thriller, with a script that won the prestigious Nichols screenplay competition in 1996, is a good watch. The ending is especially noteworthy. It is as good as the ending of the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Both lead actors do their jobs well. No problem there either.

Supporting cast also shine.

*** Too Much Coincidence

But there is a whopper of a coincidence towards the end of the movie that enables Bridges to see and follow the white van that carry both his kidnapped son and the explosives  that is hard to swallow! Just too much.

*** Forced Tension Resolution

What are the chances of just seeing The Van drive by when you are checking out the public phone at a shopping mall that your murdered girlfriend has last seen using? How many times in life people just happen to stumble upon such crucial evidence in broad daylight, in as busy a public domain as a shopping mall? That ruined the whole viewing experience for me.

A good thriller if you can just gloss over that kind of a gaping hole in the script.",1445644800,,2517,4.608988764044944

It's a remake of ""The commies are everywhere"" propaganda from the Cold War, only this time it's US patriots.  Even the death van has""Liberty"" on its side.

Not only is the rewrite of history extremely offensive, the movie itself is superficial and formulaic, with a hokey car-racing-through-town-in-the-wrong-lane-and-driving-on-the-sidewalk scene that is intended, in a ham-fisted sort of way to generate a bit of nail-biting suspense to keep the 12 year olds entertained.

Plus, I really enjoyed both these actors in previous films, which is the only reason I watched it..  Robbins does a pretty good bad guy, but Bridges just doesn't carry off the crazy-angry incompentent alpha male very well.

The professor talks about a bombing of a building: was there a conspiracy? Is his lecture convincing? When has a politician ever been a rle model?

Faraday does some snooping into the background of ""Oliver Lang"". ""People lie all the time."" Faraday identifies his neighbor from a yearbook. [Are copies sent to government agencies?] There is a flashback to the FBI raid on a suspect's home. It is explained as the result of a misunderstanding! Did the computer make a mistake? ""Garbage in, garbage out."" Faraday continues his research into his neighbors, and uses a ruse to enter his home. Later he finds a crime in Kansas City. Why is Brooke against him? Fenimore explains his background to Faraday. Then Brooke sees something suspicious, and follows an old car (too closely)? But she is seen. Brooke makes a phone call, then something happens.

Faraday learns his answering machine was erased. Who could have done it? [Can this be ever prevented?] Faraday learns of a link with a bomber. It connects to his son. Is there some horrible plot going on? Can Faraday talk to his FBI friend? Does he see suspicious packages? Do people abuse rental cars? Is there an infernal plot against a government building? Will there be an exciting chase to perk up the story? Will a fall guy be used to plant a bomb?

This is a very clever film that is low-keyed until the end. Is the story incredible? Can the villains be that clever in their fool-proof planning? Only big experienced organizations can be so precise in their planning. Even then there are few perfect plans, except in movies. [Does this film remind you of ""The Parallax View""?]",1426550400,,2264,4.797435897435897
3527407,1,B001D7T6CM,"The ending to ARLINGTON ROAD totally sucks. It defies all logic and ruins the film. Sadly, that ending was undoubtedly the first thing that the screenplay writers invented ... LIKE THE PUNCH-LINE OF A VERY BAD JOKE.

SPOILERS: Tim Robbins plays a domestic terrorist who gradually is suspected by his neighbor, played by Jeff Bridges. Towards the end, Bridges' character knows he is right and is following a delivery van that contains his kidnapped son and a bomb that will be used to blow up the FBI building in Washington, D.C.

MORE SPOILERS: Suddenly Tim Robbins' character cuts off Bridges' car, stops him, beats him up ... and then in turn is beaten up by Jeff Bridges' character ... who does not kill him, knock him out, or even tie him up. Instead, Bridges' character gets into his car and continues following the delivery van to the FBI building ... and gets PAST all FBI gate security and underneath the FBI building behind the van. NO BOMB is in the van ... nor is the kidnapped son.

EVEN MORE SPOILERS: Where is the bomb? During the fist fight, Tim Robbins' character had his accomplices MOVE the bomb OUT of the van and INTO the trunk of Bridges' car ... where Bridges ironically sees it 2 seconds before it blows up him AND the FBI building.

HOW could Tim Robbins' character have predicted with 100 percent certainty that Jeff Bridges' character would (1) get away from him and not just drive to the FBI's building but would (2) get the car past all their security and safely get underneath the building? Eh?

And (3) WHEN did Robbins' character have the time to instruct his accomplices to remove the bomb from the van and put it in the trunk of Bridges' car? (And was that improvised on the spot or, even stupider yet, planned days or weeks in advance??)  And (4) HOW did Robbins' character know that Bridges' character would leave him alive and conscious AND untied, so he could easily telephone further instructions to one of his accomplices, who would detonate the bomb in Bridges' car with a remote radio device after it got driven underneath the FBI building? Eh? Eh?

To me, that ""twist ending"" ... and the ""twist aftermath"" of Bridges' character being totally blamed as the solo bomber ... totally destroyed the interest of the first 90 minutes of the film.

I have no objections to films ending with ""evil triumphant"" ... provided there is SOME LOGIC to the plot ... and provided the script is designed with something more than ""shock"" as its motive. COOL HAND LUKE and A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST are successful examples, but this movie is NOT.",1426291200,,2600,4.624728850325379

Jeff Bridges plays a college professor who teaches a conspiracy theory type class and Tim Robbins is the very dark conspiracy agitator who just moves in next door.

3527436,1,B001D7T6CM,"Plot: Guy professor who teaches classes on US ""home grown"" terrorists groups. The groups that we were taught about in the 90s . . . Americans . . . for generations . . . wanting to destroy government, not foreigners wanting to invade and destroy us. He not teaches classes about this group because we learn his wife, a former FBI agent, was killed by a bomb. So some people move in next door. One thing leads to another. The guy suspects that his neighbors are terrorists. So you have to decide . . . are they? Or is the guy crazy because of what happened to his wife and what he thinks about all the time given his profession?

Comments: This is a liberals dream come true movie. It shows ""rednecks"" who value their guns killing government agents. It talks about ""Christians"" who are violent. Etc. And the movie makes you think that they are everywhere and just evil and out to get you. It creates all the suspicions about the people that liberals despise. The problem here is the groups stereotyped in this movie are not the enemy. It is about as fake as the setting. You see a sprawling green campus that is supposed to be George Washington University. GWU is in downtown DC and is lined by city sidewalks. But the camera spans and shows the US Capitol building. Fake. Reston Mall? More fakery in this movie. The drama built up was kinda cheap. You have bright lights shown on the actors' scared faces. You have screaming background music (not an actor screaming but the music) while someone is thumbing through a newspaper or book and sees someone. It is just absurd. The only reason I even gave this movie one star other than I had to select at least one was the ending. It was kinda shocking and clever.

3527448,2,B001D7T6CM,"It's not a coincidence that I almost grew to hate this film; it was filled with so many coincidences that you'll feel that way too after watching.

From people mysteriously bumping into each other to others being killed in mysterious ways, I grew weary.  People intuitively know that some unlikely event is bound to happen in their lives occasionally, but if you take the odds of each event -- assuming that they are independent -- and multiply those odds by all the odds of the other unlikely events occurring. . . well, you reach a near impossibility.  And to me this movie was almost impossible.

But what seems really impossible (if ""impossible"" could be a relative thing; do we really need the ""really"" part?):  how did this fine group of actors read this script and still decide to make a go of it?  That really boggles the mind.  From Jeff Bridges to Tim Robbins to Joan Cusack to Hope Davis, you'd think that at least one of them would have read the script and just said, ""Phooey!""  I never read the script and that's what I said afterwards after ""seeing"" the script in my mind.

It seemed to me that Mr. Bridges played the liberal guy; after all, he was a college professor.  How many professors have you met that are conservative?  And Mr. Robbins was supposed to be the hard-core right wing nut job; after all, he had a dark past after having done some ""right wing"" things.  (I always find it amusing, if not exasperating, to always portray the right as a bomb-throwing bunch.  Just look at all of the left-wing nut jobs that come out and ""demonstrate peacefully"" by trashing small businesses, like what just happened with the Trayvon Martin verdict.  But Hollywood is so far left they always want to slam the right, even if it defies logic.)  But each of these two actor's actions seem to be contradictory, so after watching, I'm not sure what the director was trying to say.

I believe that the ending was changed after the fact.  Why?  I won't tell you the ending -- you'll have to find out yourself if you are foolish enough to screen this big screen mess -- but I did a double take just before the credits rolled.  I believe that the director didn't buy all the coincidences himself, and so changed the story last minute so that he could wave all of those coincidences away with one hand.

It also says that a perception of truth could exist in which a respected senior female FBI agent is happily married for a long time to a guy who then turns out to be one of America's worst home-grown terrorists, and THE MEDIA WOULD NEVER QUESTION THIS. I think our media are often not what we need them to be, and have a lot to answer for, but this movie suggests all the best reporters and researchers are basically asleep!

So this movie has no credibility, and yet it got made, and a majority of reviewers here give it 5 stars. What is going on?

Answer : The screenwriter had an agenda that truth and logic got sacrificed to, the studio guy who approved it had no idea what he was doing, and the 5 star reviewers here either have agendas of their own, or (more likely) are simply not intelligent enough to think through the implications of the story.

3527466,4,B001D7T6CM,"In two words: great movie! Of course it had flaws, as all films do, but essentially they were few and far between and relatively insignificant. The basis of the film lies in terrorism. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who teaches a class in extremists at a local university, begins to suspect his neighbors Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusak) of being more than what they appear. Faraday begins to find inconsistencies in the stories Oliver gives him and what the truth reveals and the story unfolds from there.

Jeff Bridges did a good job, but with a lot of heavy breathing, which I'm sure was convey panic and fear, however it tended to get on my nerves. Also in his classes, he would be talking about terrorist groups and events which they clearly must not have been able to use actual names and places where true attacks occurred, so instead they showed the faces of people we all know, but gave them different names which was intriguing, but also somewhat distracting.

Tim Robbins just did a wonderful job, and I was thrilled to see him in such a good film, joined by Joan Cusak who gave an worthy performance...and even though you didn't see a whole lot of their kids, they managed to carry off a definite spookiness that really added to the atmosphere and mood of that whole house. Something else that impressed me was that such a relatively small nucleus of a cast managed to pull off such an involved plot and storyline. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film.

The ending which I won't give away, but have to let it be said that I thought it was incredibly thought provoking and perfect for the film. Couldn't have been a better ending and that's important. In many cases an ending can make or break the film. The last movie I saw was great, but the ending could have been a lot better which really hurt the overall film.

It's been several days since I watched this movie, and I can't stop thinking about all the implications of the events that transpired in this movie.  I keep stringing together ""what about this . . ."" and ""what ifs . . ."" that go way beyond the movie itself and enter into my everyday life -- the terrorism that has crept into all of our lives since 9/11.

I think what is scariest about this movie is the idea that such an educated person could be so easily manipulated and used as a tool for a terrorist group.  If a man who lectures about the perils of terrorism to his students in such a thought-provoking way can be sucked into such a horrible scheme, how do we less-educated or less-perceptive individuals avoid such dangers?  As a parent, I honestly could see myself reacting exactly the same way to the boy in the street, to my child wanting to be included and have more friends, and ultimately to doing anything to protect my child who is in danger.

I used to wonder how any rational human being could be sucked into these terrorist groups to the point of turning against their own country.  After watching this movie, it seems like it would be just a matter of finding a person's trigger point.  That scares me.

The film's musings on terrorism in a pre-9/11 America are interesting food for thought, particularly in that they seem to be challenging many of the knee-jerk reactions that eventually would take place.

3527489,3,B001D7T6CM,"I have been on something of a tear lately in the wake of Jeff Bridges' Oscar victory this year for his portrayal of broken-down country singer/songwriter Bad Blake in the film Crazy Hearts. In my previous reviews my main premise had been that there was a strong thread running through many of Bridges' performances that harked back to his role as future good old boy, Duane Jackson, in the classic Texas-based coming of age film The Last Picture Show and that culminated in Crazy Hearts.

This film, Arlington Road, speaks to another thread, the intrepid, if sometimes foolhardy warrior prince fighting against evil (or at least the unknown). A previous well-known example was Blow-Up where he held off the Irish Republican Army (IRA) single-handedly (well, one agent in Boston anyway). This political thriller filled a niche after the tragic Oklahoma City bombings by native terrorists and before the axis shifted to 9/11 type foreign-based acts of terror. Thus, the notion to put a microscope to view a small but extensively-engaged proto-survivalist right wing-conspiracy against the federal (or state for that matter) government for some grievances had a certain timeliness then.

Bridges, as an undaunted professor, out to solve some baffling mystery (and also as a grieving victim of a governmental screw-up which killed his wife) that has cropped up and ensnared him in its web and Tim Robbins as the avenger bad angel and ensnarer battle this one out. Not Bridges' best performance because he is just too manic (and the script is a little too politically heavy-handed and obvious) in the end but kind of an interesting period piece just the same.

3527494,1,B001D7T6CM,I like Jeff bridges and read the movie description on the back at Blockbuster and thought it would be a good conspiracy movie. The plot has many twists and turns. Jeff Bridges plays a collage professor who teaches a course on the history of American terrorism and begins investigating a neighbor he suspects of belonging to a right wing terrorist organization. The professor surprisingly shows how federal agents botched a raid on a family (Parsons family) it wrongly suspected of being part of a right wing terrorist group who were innocent resulting in the deaths of Parsons's wife and youngest son. He also mistakingly describes the Oklahoma bomber's attack on the federal building as using C 4 explosives rather than fertilizer which was actually used. The professor's suspicions of his neighbor were laid arrest for a while until his girlfriend was murdered by the right wing terrorist organization. The ending was meant to appease left wing extremist paranoia and convince the general public that there is a vast right wing terrorist conspiracy which cannot be uncovered by our government,1254355200,,1094,5.11731843575419

3527496,2,B001D7T6CM,"Okay, look at this objectively and realize that it is not that good.  Please, do that for me.  I know that it stars two of the better actors around and on of the best supporting ladies out there, and sure, the action is well paced and it has one unbelievably great ending, but when you stack up all the faults here it becomes apparent that this is not as good as it should have been.

The film is smarter than it looks, but sadly it comes off rather dull thanks to uninspired direction.

The film centers around Michael Faraday, a college professor teaching an American History class on terrorism.  His wife, a former FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty and the circumstances surrounding her death have thrown Michael into a state of seeming paranoia.  This paranoia is only heightened when he meets his next door neighbors Oliver and Cheryl.  They seem sweet enough, but there is just something off that raises concern in Michael.  Everything he talks to thinks he's crazy, but is he really?

I don't want to give away too much, but the movie does that for you already.  That's one of my main concerns.  We are expected throughout the first half of the film to slip into Michael's paranoia with him, and feel that he is blowing things out of proportion; but Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack won't allow us to do that.  They play their characters with so much obvious `strangeness' that it's shocking Michael is the ONLY one who thinks they are terrorists.  I love both actors, but Cusack plays Cheryl like she were a joke really, and Robbins is so unconvincing as a `normal guy' that even when he supposedly convinces Michael he's not a terrorist all he manages to do is further convince us that he is.

My second issue is with the whole middle of the film, and parts of the ending as well.  It goes from this `trying to be smart' psychological thriller into this `lets be stupid' action thriller that just throws off any real tension they were trying to build.  When Hope Davis hangs up the phone and sees Joan Cusack giving her that ridiculous smile I knew that the movie was just going down hill.

Now, many have mentioned that the end of the film is intelligent and well done, and I agree.  The final frames are brilliant, but brilliant to a fault.  It's so smart that it makes me hate the balance of the film even more.

Why would they waste such a marvelously thought out revelation on a poorly constructed B-Grade thriller?

That said, Jeff Bridges works very, very hard to elevate this movie, and he manages to get us on his side throughout.  He is convincing, even when his surroundings are not.  We believe him, and so I hate to fault the film so much because he tries so hard.  Oh well, I still love him and I respect him for giving this a try.  It seemed good on paper I'm sure.  How was he to know that Cusack and Robbins were going to make a mockery of this script?  How were we to expect that a film starring some of the most impressive talents working today was going to be such a waste of potential?

In other words; watch something else.",1233273600,,3057,4.410714285714286

Another pleasant surprise was Joan Cusack, who was very effective as Robbins' creepy wife. If you're paranoid, you should like this story. I owned the DVD and traded it, but would like to see it again. It's worth several looks if you wait long enough between viewings to forget some of those twists.",1232236800,,643,4.6902654867256635
3527498,1,B001D7T6CM,"The ending was so anti-climatic; because if you've seen these type of movies, you know what's going on, and what's going to happen.

You see how Jeff Bridges is Professor Michael Faraday; being manipulated by the terrorists as he feeds off the death of his wife who was a Federal Agent who died in a shootout (a subtle reference to Randy Weaver family at Ruby Ridge); and his disdain for the Gov't not taking the blame for her death the deaths of others at an IRS building (another subtle reference: The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing). The terrorists put to good use, his paranoia, annoying and insipid behavior to paint a very unbecoming portrait of a man on the verge of the breaking point but, [above] suspicion.....until the end.

3527499,5,B001D7T6CM,"Hollywood hasn't made a literate white-knuckled conspiracy thriller like director's Mark Pellington's ""Arlington Road"" in many moons. The genre ran out of steam in the late 1970s. The late Alan J. Pakula came closest to capturing the essence of the conspiracy thriller with two memorable efforts ""The Parallax View"" (1974) and ""All The President's Men"" (1976). Oliver Stone revived the genre briefly with ""JFK,"" but this star-studded marathon as good as it was lacked the visceral qualities of either Alfred Hitchcock's work or Pakula's pictures. Nothing about ""JFK"" surprised audiences. Stone, a filmmaker more controversial than any controversy he aroused, concerned himself more with uncovering the truth than captivating moviegoers. Indeed, David Miller's ""Executive Action"" (1973), a penny-thrifty thriller about the Kennedy assassination, entertains more than ""JFK"" on a fraction of its modest budget. Richard Donner's ""Conspiracy Theory"" (1997) and George P. Cosmatos' ""Shadow Conspiracy"" (1996) vanished almost as quickly as they showed up. Playwright David Mamet recaptured the ambiance of the conspiracy thriller with ""The Spanish Prisoner"", but the studio packed it off to the video rental shelves without much thought. Happily, after some doubts about whether it would open itself, ""Arlington Road"" made it to the big-screen. If he were alive, Alfred Hitchcock would probably applaud Mark Pellington for picking up where he left off.

""Arlington Road"" appropriates many of Hitchcock's conventions. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges of ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"") resembles the quintessential Hitchcock hero. He is an average Joe with a white-collar job. He doesn't sleep with a gun under his pillow, and he doesn't careen around in a souped-up sports car with fancy gadgets. He wears a necktie instead of a pistol. Actually, he teaches American history, and he is a widowed, single-father raising his nine-year old son, Grant Faraday (Spencer Clark Treat). Further, Hitchcock staged scenes of nail-gnawing suspense in the least dangerous settings. Remember the sun-lit cornfield in ""North by Northwest?"" Or the shower in ""Psycho?"" Or the church in ""Vertigo?"" Similarly, the action in ""Arlington Road"" takes place in areas usually considered crime free. Wide open public meeting areas, shopping malls, well-lit university classrooms, and the idyllic seclusion of the suburbs, replete with backyard barbecues and dinner parties with wholesome neighbors. The people that made ""Arlington Road"" rely on this deceptive faade of tranquility to distract audiences long enough before they hit them with the year's best paranoid thriller.

""Arlington Road"" opens with chilling images of a juvenile, Brady Lang (Mason Gamble), shambling down the middle of a street in an upper-middle-class, Virginia suburb on a bright sunny day. He clutches the charred stump of his hands. Blood dribbles onto his sneakers. Driving home from George Washington University where he lectures about terrorism, Michael Faraday spot the injured youth and speeds him to the emergency room. Michael neither knows who Brady is nor where he lives. Later, at the hospital, Brady's grateful parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins of ""Mystic River"") and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack of ""Grosse Pointe Blank""), arrive and thank him. Initially, Michael is surprised to learn that the Langs live across the street from him. Oliver explains that Brady hurt himself while apparently fooling around with fireworks, but he dismisses the accident as nothing more than ""a failed rocketry experiment."" Gradually, a closely knit relationship develops between Michael and the Langs. At the same time, Brady and Grant become fast friends. ""Our house is your house,"" Cheryl says with irony: ""We're here for you, we really are."" At a dinner party, Faraday introduces the Langs to Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis of ""The Matador""), a former graduate student who is now his girlfriend and colleague. Cheryl compliments them; they make a cute couple. Oliver exhibits the work he does as a structural architect. Cheryl confines herself to the home as the happy housewife that never complains while she rears their two daughters and son. Apparently, the only difference between the Langs and TV's ""Brady Bunch"" is three children and a housekeeper.

Meanwhile, ""Reindeer Games"" scenarist Ehren Kruger's award-winning script parcels out bits and pieces of exposition about Michael. Faraday's late wife (Laura Poe) worked for the FBI and died tragically in the line-of-duty when the Feds bungled a raid on the cabin of a suspected terrorist. ""Leah died for her country,"" Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), Leah's old partner at the FBI, consoles Michael. ""She didn't have to,"" Michael shakes his head in grief at her gravesite. Grant still suffers from the loss of his mom and bridles at the presence of Brooke, the new woman in Faraday's life. Michael himself has not totally recovered his Leah's death and pours his anxieties into his lectures about terrorism. As a history professor, Michael enjoys lecturing about domestic terrorism. He promotes conspiracy theories in the classroom and provides his students with hand-outs teeming with photos and news articles about anarchy. He refuses to believe that a single individual, no matter how resourceful, could carry out an act of terrorism on American soil without help.

""The Mothman Prophecies"" director Mark Pellington acquits himself admirably as a cinematic stylist of the highest order. After a whirlwind opening, Pellington lets the dust settle and carefully lets the tension build. Although Michael and the Langs grow closer as friends, our hero ferrets out incriminating evidence about the Langs that surprises and then disturbs him. He alienates his own son and Brooke thinks that he has lost his mind. As it turns out, Oliver isn't the man that he claims to be and Michael has the college year books to prove his point. Lenser Bobby Bukowski and Pellington surround Faraday with darkness and isolate him in their pictorial compositions. Even Wit Carver has doubts about Michael's sanity and warns him that he is heading toward oblivion. Pellington frames Faraday in increasingly tighter close-ups to suggest the mental claustrophobia that his crusade is causing him. Altogether, conspiracy theorists will want to watch ""Arlington Road"" over and over, especially in light of 9/11.",1228694400,,6366,5.414314516129032

Also, there was more than a whiff of political B.S. -- as you might expect from any movie Tim Robbins is in -- particularly when it comes to painting the FBI as bad guys and the fanatics as right-wingers.

3527505,5,B001D7T6CM,"Normally Jeff Bridges isn't one of my favorite actors but in this suspense he does a great job.  There's a couple small problems with the film.  The acting isn't up to standards by pretty much everyone except Jeff.  Seriously his wife (played by Hope Davis) sounds monotone and uninterested in her role, and the bad guy -his neighbor Tim Robbins who Jeff's suspects is part of an extremist group capable of blowing up homes and buildings- seems like the wrong choice for extremist guy because he's just too nice and mellow of a person.  Wrong choice!  Then again a nice mellow person would normally be the right choice based on the surprise factor, however when he gets angry later it doesn't seem believable enough.

Anyway the story is that Jeff and Tim get along really well... until Jeff suspects Tim isn't who he claims he is with a false name and troubled history as a teenager blowing stuff up.  And because Jeff's is a college professor who craves researching anything he can, he wants to dig up as much information on Tim as possible (even risking getting caught by Tim himself!) For most of the first half we see Tim and Jeff's family having normal conversations and being friendly neighbors, but eventually Jeff's snooping around catches up to him and Tim's true intentions are revealed.  However they're revealed in a way that really makes the storyline compelling.

Joan Cusack is Tim's REALLY fruity wife.  She's sort of hilarious in an unintentional kind of way how she comes across as unnaturally happy most of the time.  No this isn't because she's a happy house mom!  She's of course part of Tim's extremist plans but disguises it perhaps a little too well!  Speaking of unintentional humor, check out the way  Tim pushes Jeff around after Jeff's suspicions catch up to him, lol.  I think if Jeff really wanted to retaliate he'd be the aggressive one, but I could be wrong!  It's surprising seeing Jeff getting pushed around like he was.

Anyway there's a HUGE surprise at the end.  Wow I didn't see that coming at all!  I won't spoil it though.  I will say Jeff's wife and son play a part in the main chunk of the story.  Tim becomes obsessed with Jeff's son and insists that the boy come along on a scouting trip with Tim and his family based on how well the boy accepts this family, but of course Jeff doesn't want his son to go anywhere as his suspicions get more intense.  This results in some disagreements and fighting between Jeff and his son.

Also, and this isn't a spoiler because it's based on an event that happened in the past, be prepared for a VERY intense segment that shows FBI agents in the woods trying to track down an extremist hiding in his house.  They first stumble upon the young son of the extremist who happens to be walking by the FBI agents after a fishing trip home, which results in a really crazy shootout a moment later.  Crazy indeed!

Oh and too bad about Hope being in the wrong place and wrong time.  What are the odds!  Never should have made that call!  Plus the aspect of whether Jeff is imagining his neighbors intentions or whether it's just Jeff being increasingly anxious comes into the story which is nice.  These are clearly the best moments between Hope and Jeff.  I love the atmosphere and growing feeling of concern during these parts that a bombing is going to happen, all the while Tim across the street is probably overhearing and enjoying all of it.

This is a 5-star movie.  You can tell this is a 1999 film just the way the story develops and the way the entire cast give their acting performances.  I never thought that year would ever become dated but well, it has.  While the acting isn't particularly impressive, the storyline contains enough suspense and twists that should leave viewers satisfied.",1196294400,,3777,4.611694152923538
3527506,5,B001D7T6CM,"This is a movie that I think everyone should watch.  We watched it some years ago and several times since.  Everytime, it is impactful.  I started thinking about this movie recently when reading about more terror propaganda in the UK.  I was reminded of an article in the papers that described one of the 7/7 bombers as just a ""normal, average guy"" who had a regular job and loved soccer, ""just like many other young Britons, his neighbors said"".

That really hits home when you watch Arlington Road.  Everybody should be aware that THEY, too, can be manipulated to ""carry the bomb into the building.""  The references to Ruby Ridge and The OK bombing in the movie reflect the time it was made/released, but it is even more meaningful after 911.

The movie may seem to begin a bit slowly - that was my initial impression - and it was only afterward that I realized that this was a perfect metaphor for how ""normal life"" can totally mask what is really going on. But don't worry, it soon grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go until the final, horrifying revelations at the end.

Jeff Bridges plays his part very well - a guy so blinded by emotion that he is putty in the hands of cold-blooded manipulators.  Bridges (as the hero) thinks he's got a handle on what's going on, but in fact, this is hubris. One could say the same for most ""conspiracy theorists.""  You only know what ""they"" want you to know or figure out.

Some people think the plot is too complex, too far-fetched, but I think that's not the case.  You don't need much imagination to see how such an elaborate set-up could easily be achieved in anyone's life.  There are plenty of movies that talk about that aspect of things.  The only thing is, they all make it seem like such dramatic, high adventure, that we forget that it is the mundane, the ordinary, the ho-hum existence, that veils truly evil things.

The psychological slamming is all there at the end and that's exactly it; how it MUST be in real life.  Life is so ""ordinary, so boring, so tedious, so commonplace, that it lulls us into complacency.  And that is undoubtedly what the filmmaker was trying to convey... that sense of ordinariness, mundane life that covers another reality of conspiracy and evil-doing.

For example, only AFTER the end of the movie do you realize that the bleeding kid at the beginning was all part of the set-up, that the terrorist/parents actually used their own child as bait, and even caused a severe injury to the child in order to make that bait more compelling.  Was the kid brain-washed or terrorized?  Probably.  What kind of monsters would do that to a child?

And that makes the final scene even more chilling, where the terrorists stand there in front of the house for sale and wear their ""mask of sanity,"" saying the world is getting too scary...

Yes, the good guys die and the bad guys continue on... but then, isn't that reality?",1194307200,,2909,4.55

It is an idea that everyone can be manipulated to do what the real terrorists wanted them to do or to ""bring the bomb into the building"" without their being aware of it.

It's an intriguing look at terrorism in a way I've never seen portrayed on film. It's heartbreaking and breathtaking often at the same time. It's finely acted, superbly directed, and completely unpredictable. Not a bad combination! The movie does border on complete unbelievability for a brief time but by the time the credits roll you will be a believer in the message.

This Blu-Ray version is totally capable. There is little grain in dark scenes and the colors remain vivid throughout the movie. Sadly, there are no ""extra"" extras we didn't already have on the standard edition, but what's here is adequate.

The acting is good, Bridges giving the strongest performance, though it's always a pleasure to see Joan Cusack in ANYTHING. The script is good, the direction is good... but the movie as a whole left me empty and a little irritated.

It's unclear what this film would like to do, aside from entertain. Should we walk out feeling that terrorists are much more complex than they seem? Should we walk out feeling unsafe and suspecting everyone? There are scenes in this movie where Jeff Bridges is teaching a class in terrorism, and he talks about how illusory our feeling of safety is... and that's fine, but I wanted one of the students to ask ""So what do you want us to do? Be afraid? Worry? Never leave the house? What?"" In that way the movie seems to want to just stir up a lot of fear without giving it any direction or offering any possible solution. Of course there ISN'T a solution, but I feel that this movie stirs up a lot of fear and paranoia just to draw the audience into some excitement, and then makes the audience feel bad for being excited by such a thing. I felt manipulated and annoyed after it ended.

I also think this entire subject is a little too sensitive to be trying to milk entertainment dollars out of. If you want to make a serious drama, go ahead, but don't try to both draw us in with the promise of ""spooky terrorist thrills"" and then want to have a serious look at the issue. I was also a little bit uncomfortable with the sheer number of children-in-extreme-peril scenes. Again, if you want to treat this subject seriously, go ahead, but don't invite us to be ""thrilled"" by it.

I will say that the cinematography [by Bobby Bukowski] in this film was amazing. It makes SUCH a difference simply to have some visually interesting compositions up on the screen for once, instead of having movies that have all the compositional thought of snapshots. It just gives you something to LOOK at. My favorite scenes were the one with the RED phones against the grey sky, and the fence with the grey roofs above it. Amazing! Kudos to you, guys! This was literally my favorite part of the movie.

As for the ""surprise"" ending-- Woo Hoo, Big Deal.

I have come to like this movie less and less since I saw it [and that was pre-9/11]. This is one I would say you could skip completely, not even wait for the video. Just skip it. It leaves you with nothing but a bad taste in your mouth.",1181260800,,2511,4.400862068965517
3527514,1,B001D7T6CM,"Horrible.  Absolutely horrible in characters, story and atmospherics.

Jeff Bridges' character is so inconsistent and contradictory that he is not only unbelievable, but grating.  The story fails in every way possible.  The bad guy's plan depends not only upon being able to predict (not just manipulate) actions of multiple characters, but to intricately synchronize them, even when they have only indirect access.  Even worse, their plan depends upon Bridges' character making critical inferences on a precise schedule.  But the cardinal sin is that script has as a key element of the bad guys' plan an ultra-sophisticated attempt to negate/disrupt another key element of that plan, that is, that Bridges' character by a stroke of luck/coincidence combined with a flash of brilliance will thwart the bad guys' effort to sabotage their own plan.

Pacing and other atmospherics can overcome substantial flaws in the script, but in this movie, they are so amateurish that they emphasize and exacerbate those problems.",1176595200,,1016,5.3924050632911396
3527515,4,B001D7T6CM,"I avoid calling this a good ""political"" thriller, as I think the movie director might like to bill it, because the political motivations invoked to set the villains in motion here are almost ludicrous. This movie was made before 9/11 - so the film's ""terrorists"" are presented as a ""vast right-wing conspiracy.""

However even this simple-minded conception of the threat of terrorism is muddied by Jeff Bridges' fervid ranting.  Bridges plays a college professor teaching classes in government, civil liberties, and terrorism. However he seems to be almost unhinged and perhaps suspiciously complicit in terrorist acts himself as he spirals off into confused diatribes against - first lone right-wing bombers like the Unibomber - then pervasive right-wing conspiracies - then the U.S. government itself, and specifically the F.B.I. Bridges blames all these entities for his wife's death, and his lectures apparently consist of little more than projected pictures of severed limbs and bleeding bodies left in the wake of such terrorist attacks. Furthermore, he incites his students to similar suspicion and hatred. I doubt that a professor who conducted his classes in such a way would hold his job very long.

So in order to enjoy this movie, it might be best to disregard all its muddled political assumptions. Just take it as a contest between some scary villains and some good guys. Then you can sit back and appreciate the very real suspense that this movie builds.

""Arlington Road"" has one of the eeriest opening sequences I've seen in any movie. And then most memorable of all - is a scene involving Joan Cusack.

3527517,5,B001D7T6CM,"Noon. A suburb of Washington, DC, a street dotted with houses just a shade too small to be McMansions. No one is around.

Wait --- here comes someone. A boy. White, of course. About 9 years old. Dressed in jeans and high-top sneakers. Walking unsteadily in the middle of the street. Lurching, really.

And now we see why: blood dots his sneakers, makes a trail on the pavement.

Luckily, a resident comes along --- Michael Faraday (yes, he has the same name as the great scientist who experimented with electricity and magnetism). He scoops the boy up, rushes him to the hospital. Eventually, the boy's parents show up, grateful beyond measure that the rocket their son set off wasn't more powerful --- and that they have such a good neighbor.

And now we see the opening credits: distorted photos of suburban life. They look anything but peaceful. Clever movie lovers will recall shots like this in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" Clearly, something evil thrives alongside the barbeques.

But how could that be? Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a history professor who teaches college courses in terrorism. He's widowed --- his wife was an FBI agent, killed in a botched raid --- and only recently dating a graduate student (Hope Davis). All he wants is to raise his nine-year-old son and find some peace.

And the neighbors, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack) couldn't be nicer. They sense Faraday's loneliness, and they take steps --- inviting him over, including his son in their family outings.

Until, one day.....right, the Langs are too perfect. Faraday senses that when a letter for Lang is wrongly delivered to his mailbox. It's forwarded from the University of Pennyslvania., Odd. Didn't Lang say he went to Kansas State?

And so it begins: a neighbor furtively investigating his neighbor. And finding that there's something wrong in his story, that he may not be who he says he is.

At the same time, Faraday is teaching his class. That bombing in St. Louis (really, the Oklahoma City bombing). Scary, wasn't it? But remember how much better you felt the next day, when the FBI produced a single suspect: ""We want one man, one name, and we want it fast because we want our security back.""

Here's the problem with Farraday: He may teach terrorism, but he's a lousy detective. That is, his suspect knows what's going on. And confronts him. There's a scene in Faraday's back yard that's as menacing as any conversation on film: Faraday looking at a college year book that proves Lang has changed his name, Lang sneaking up on him. And then the reversal of expectation: It's Lang who's mad. Because he has an explanation, a damned good one. And if Faraday only had the decency to ask....

What's happening? Faraday can't tell. Is Lang really a structural engineer working on a mall in Reston? Or is he a leader of a terrorist cell plotting mass murder in Washington?

Then Faraday's girlfriend sees....Then Faraday's girlfriend rushes to a pay phone...Then Faraday's girlfriend turns around....

The secret of thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock explained, is to give people a fear bigger than the fears they live with every day. Movies with special effects and ridiculous plots do this poorly. Movies based on brilliant ""what ifs?"" make you pee your pants. Like ""Rosemary's Baby"" --- what if a man makes a deal with Satan? Or ""Arlington Road"" --- what if your neighbor is Satan?

There are critics who have called ""Arlington Road"" overheated and improbable --- especially the end. Well, it fooled me. And terrified me. The cinematography, the music, the rising paranoia of Bridges, the spookily friendly Robbins and Cusack: all the elements work together to make you scared of parking lots, mini-vans, the repairman outside your house.

As for the end, it forces you to reexamine everything. Was it just good fortune that the Langs were Faraday's neighbors? That letter in Faraday's mailbox --- did the mailman do that? Hey, what about their injured son at the beginning --- could that be...? For God's sake, where did this plot begin?

3527522,3,B001D7T6CM,"What shocks me about many of the movie reviews written on these boards is the apparent blindness to possible political manipulation or propaganda that might exist in any well known movie. Is that to say that hollywood is politcally neutral? Is tim robbins politically neutral? What is the message here? That being white, republican and christian is a dangerous thing? That those who would blow up innocent children are not that far removed from the typical conservative? Certainly. You would have to be an idiot not to see that.

Consider two quotes in this film. One by faraday the bridges character who is teaching a class on domestic terrorism. Referring to the oklahoma city bombing which is depited here as the st luois bombimg faraday puts forth his theory that the killer did not act alone. He says that the killer was a ""moderate republican."" What does that mean? That a real conservative can be expected to kill 300 people? In another quote the robbin's character, the terrorist says ""there are millions of us"" and indeed it seems that they are. These pasty faced ultra pale people are everywhere in this film manipulating your children in a boy scout group, following you everywhere you go and listening in on your phone calls. The bad guys are so smart and so large in number that in the end they not only succeed in blowing up a federal building but are able to kill and pin the crime on faraday.

This film a fairly taut thriller with a pleasantly unusaul ending. The good guy doesn't win. Yes it is intense with many ultra close up shots so that you can't see who may be in the background. At first faraday is a little suspicious of his neighbors though he has little reason to be suspicious. And while faraday is far too suspicous it almost seems plausable because of his background as a teacher of terrorists and the fact his fbi wife was killed by them. Still he jumpes to conclusions and finds out what is about to take place but he can't stop it.",1121558400,,1965,4.579545454545454

3527524,3,B001D7T6CM,"Winner of the Nicholl Fellowship Screenwriting competition sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Arlington Road is only the sixth winner of the award to actually make it onto the big screen. Sporting a star-studded cast, the film creates an aura of tension and suspense that keeps the audience glued to the screen. With a thought-twisting and surprising plotline, Arlington Road reinforces the post-September 11th (even though it's a 1999 movie) mentality that terrorists lurk around every corner. Tim Robbins puts in his best performance since appearing in the critically acclaimed Shawshank Redemption, and Jeff Bridges turns in a memorable performance himself. Both are fitting, since Arlington Road is a memorable movie...

Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college professor who specializes in studying homegrown terrorists in the United States. A resident of Northern Virginia, his FBI agent wife died in the midst of a botched Ruby Ridge-style government raid. With a ten-year-old son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), to raise, Michael becomes an expert on the mindset and methods of terrorists such as Timothy McVeigh. Studying the terrorist threat becomes the central focus of his life, and its domination of his thoughts causes Michael to develop an acute form of paranoia.

But when the Arlington Road (the street where Michael lives) house next door is purchased by Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), Michael's life begins to change for the better. The friendliness of his new neighbors creates new inroads in Michael's ability to coup with the loss of his wife, and Grant becomes best friends with the Langs' son Brady (Mason Gamble). Things are going smoothly between the Faradays and the Langs until Michael catches Oliver in a petty lie. Immediately, his paranoia kicks in, and as the Langs continue their strange behavior (such as hiding a set of blueprints from him), Michael's fears get the best of him.

Investigating the background of the Langs, Michael finds out that they are not who they claim to be. In fact, Oliver is actually known as William Fenimore. Convinced that the Langs are planning an attack on the FBI headquarters (one on par with the Oklahoma City bombing), Michael attempts to convince his son, his colleagues, and anyone who will listen. But no one seems to understand. Will Michael convince the FBI before it's too late? Or is he only a delusional madman living out his paranoid fantasies in the aftermath of his wife's death?

Wrought with suspense and peppered with hair-raising moments, Arlington Road is a unique and compelling film. The premise is befitting of a post-September 11th terrorist film, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood remakes the film using Islamic terrorists instead of the homegrown brand from this movie. With a surprise ending which will keep you guessing until the end (and probably afterward since the whole thing tends to stretch the limits of reality), Arlington Road is a fun and interesting film. Possessing a well-maintained level of suspense and an interesting set of characters, Arlington Road is a definite must-see film...

3527525,4,B001D7T6CM,"I can still remember ARLINGTON ROAD surprising me the first time I watched it.  The film sets you up to expect a kind of everyday, run-of-the-mill, suburban thriller.  But then, as Jeff Bridges descends into a passionate mission to discover the truth about his next-door neighbor, fueled by an intense yearning to honor his wife by studying the ""underground"" factions in the United States, the film develops into something unusual, intelligent, and exciting.  While the acting performance of Bridges tends to get a little over the top and heavy-handed (as it often does in other films), his intensity seems strangely appropriate for this film.  As the plot thickens and begins to burn, the audience is fueled by Bridges's emotion and anger, leading all the way up to the film's incredible climax.  Seriously folks, the ending is pretty killer and forces you to think back over the entire film.

This film is not ""leftist"" propaganda and it is not a film that attacks the outer limits of the conservative right.  Director Mark Pellington manages to achieve a sense of moral ambiguity.  On the one hand, we feel for Jeff Bridges: we experience his anger at the government's lack of competence in dealing with violent acts of terrorism.  We too feel frustrated by the government's attempt to pacify its citizens and instill a sense of security.  On the other hand, we shy away from the extremist tendencies of Tim Robbins and understand a need to change the system from within.  A lack of responsibility and morality in government does not warrant a violent response against unsuspecting civilians.  You will spend time rooting for both sides in this film, if only a little bit.  I highly recommend ARLINGTON ROAD to anyone who enjoys an intelligent thriller.",1113696000,,1756,4.952218430034129

Tim Robbins turns in an engaging performance and always manages to keep a small part of me on his side- no matter how evil it may be. Jeff Bridges and his character's girlfriend were a little lacking, but Robbins and the ever-fabulous Joan Cusack more than made up for it. The kids in this movie were good too- exuding a strange ""Children of the Corn"" feel despite their limited screen time.

Its a timely film as well in this era of fear and terrorism- pertaining more to the una-bomber and Oklahoma City and such internal militia groups or activists, than foreign attackers such as in the World Trade Center.

I found it to be generally well rounded and acted. The cinematic style was appealing, and the story engaging. I loved the use of light in the scenes, and the mis-en-scene it could create. Also, the colors of the costumes and the use of metal and decor spoke to me on a different level than the script. Each detail was telling you some additional information. Its a more character driven story in my opinion, but the climax and typical twist are satisfying, and the end is intelligent and thought provoking.

Thankfully Mark Pellington (Director) opted for something more realistic than that stereotypical portrayal.
There are no madmen, in the conventional sense, in this film, just ordinary people with grudges. People who have been hurt by the government and want to get back at it for what they perceive to be injustices. Pellington also reminds us that we are so quick to find scapegoats to blame because it gives us a sense of relief, a feeling that all is once again right with the world, and that acts of terrorism can only be carried out by `others' not by people like us. I don't want to give you the wrong impression however, because this is certainly not a didactic movie.
As to the movie itself, the plot is cleverly written and you definitely feel the tension and suspense building as the movie progresses. The characters are believable and frightening because of their normality. Joan Cusack was perfectly cast as the wife of the half-sane, half mad terrorist. I still can't get forget that sinister smile of hers.  Tim Robbin's character was credible, with the right balance of insanity and reason. He definitely wasn't the `typical villain.' As for Bridges, he was the one who made this whole movie work, without him the movie would have flopped.
I would highly recommend this movie, I don't give too many movies 5 stars but this one definitely deserved it. Arlington Road has a great cast, a great storyline, but best of all, it gets you to thinking about terrorism and what motivates terrorists. This is a very relevant movie, especially after the events of 9/11.",1089158400,,1780,4.760517799352751

If he is black, a black Muslim, or some such thing, he gets the hidden suspect treatment. ""Arlington Road"" is Robbins as a right-wing wacko who plans to blow up the government. The message is that the right in this country is dominated by white racists who think nothing of killing many, because they are Fascists. It is heavy-handed and compared with Truth fails miserably.

3527532,4,B001D7T6CM,"Director:  Mark Pellington
Cast:  Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis, Robert Gossett.
Running Time:  117 minutes.
Rated R for some bomb violence and language.
A gripping look at the horror that terroism can bring is very effective due to idea that it is a threat that can hit close to home.  The film opens with college professor Michael Faraday (played extremely well by Jeff Bridges) finding an child on the streets of his neighborhood with half his hand blown off due to a fireworks accident.  Faraday rushes the boy to the hospital, not knowing his identity or who his parents are.  He later finds out that the boy is the son of the all-American neighborrs Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack; in equal chilling performances that make will make your skin crawl) who have just moved across the street in on Arlington Road.
As Faraday gets to know the Lang family more intimately, he begins to suspect that they are not all that they claim and seem to be.  Faraday's girlfriend (Hope Davis) believes that he is just paranoid due to the tragic death of his wife, who was gunned down by a right-wing group who was suspected to be terrorists.  The professor is uncertain what to be believe--is he really just consumed with the Langs because of a haunted past, or is Oliver really a part of a horrific terrorist conspiracy that be lethal to his community?
Director Mark Pellington creates an intense, riveting film that does not skip a beat--it unravels from the very start with the eerie introduction and the truth is revealed exceptionally well with a superb, twisted finale.  The cast does an great job, especially Robbins, who is stellar as the suspected mad-bomber.  The DVD has some nice features, including some nice commentary from Pellington and Bridges, as well as an alternative ending that is equally as surprising.  A fine, brainy thriller that is sure to shock and keep the audience on the edge of their toes.",1085702400,,1953,4.765578635014837
3527533,5,B001D7T6CM,"First, raspberries to the reviewers who felt impelled to give away the ending.  It would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it, guys!!!
Anyway, ARLINGTON ROAD is one dark and disturbing movie, fueled with paranoia, suspicions, and mistrust.  Jeff Bridges, looking for the first time like an elderly gentleman (not old, just aging), gives a tense performance as a history teacher who lost his FBI wife in a botched raid.  He now teaches terrorism at a college in the DC area.  The movie's opening is gutwrenching from the start, but necessary to involve Bridges with his new neighbors, played like Stepford Wives by Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins.  But all is not as it seems.  Bridges is sure Robbins is a terrorist, responsible for a dreadful bombing in St. Louis, and is ultimately planning more bombings.  Bridges' live-in girl friend (Hope Davis) at first doesn't buy into Bridges' theory, but later finds proof that brings her to Bridges' side.  From there on, though, it's a frightening change of pace as Bridges races to stop Robbins' plot and save his son in the meantime.  Mark Pellington's direction is right on, and the ending is quite unexpected.
This is not a conventional movie, and not one that brightens your day, but it is an intense, well-done and unusual thriller.

Despite the demanding label of ""political thriller"", having taken into consideration all the ingredients above, I was convinced that Arlington Road would offer me an enjoyable time.
I admit that I finished viewing the movie with a feeling of disappointment and disbelief. To be fair, there is not doubt that Arlington Road provides a great dosage of suspense throughout its duration. But if you make the mistake and try to think of what you just saw, after the end titles, everything seems to fall apart.
The basic character of our story is Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges). He is working as a professor of political history, with terrorism being its main focus. This, combined with the loss of his wife caused by a wrong judgment by FBI, renders him particularly sensitive to relevant stimuli. We can sense from the beginning that his fragile psyche will play an important role as the story evolves. After a strong opening sequence we see Faraday developing friendly relations with his new neighbors. Until the day an unexpected event puts doubts in his clouded mind. The question is clear: Are his neighbors involved in a terrorist group? That was it. Arlington Road now resorts to a series of easy clichs. Its obvious purpose is to surprise the viewer with the known plot twist of the neighbor who is not as innocent as we thought at the beginning - or could he be innocent, after all?
Tim Robbins gives a satisfactory performance in the role of the mysterious neighbor. On the other hand, Jeff Bridges, whose role as the ""Dude"" in Big Lebowski was absolutely amazing, here constantly gave me an impression of being over the top: his performance featured numerous hysteric reactions and grimaces. Some viewers may explain them based on Faraday's unstable mental condition; nevertheless they failed to convince me.
Director Mark Pellington does a more than adequate job with the script he has in his hands. Still, he is capable for a lot more things as revealed by his next and undoubtedly better creation, Mothman Prophecies.
I will conclude with a short comment regarding the highly praised film's closing sequence. Without revealing anything, here is what crossed my mind when watching it: Each of the terrorists should have had at least 3 Ph. D. degrees in Psychology. Only such collected knowledge would enable them to predict with the shown accuracy the reactions of so many people on so many occasions.

The suspense was incredible, the camera work was great (with several Hitchcock-esque shots added in the mix), the plot was nicely twisted. It was a great movie! If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, go check this movie out. It had my heart pumping at twice my optimal heart rate from the first minute of the movie. I can't really give any of the details of the movie away, because it would really ruin a lot of it. Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins were the perfect choice for both characters. I really wish I could say more about the movie, but this is the type of movie that would be ruined by knowing too much. Don't even read the cover of the movie
A few words of caution: this movie is not for the faint of heart. However, if you think you are partially faint hearted, just don't watch the first 5 minutes...which (at least for me), was the most disturbing part of the movie. There are several scenes of violence, and there is blood, but the violence isn't what makes this movie so intense..it is the suspense. The camera angles and the film score make the movie almost unbearable when it comes to suspense. I could have shared my seat with several other people because I *only* used the edge of it! There are many, many ""jump scenes"" (scenes that make you jump out of your seat), despite what Screenit.com says. The language isn't great, but it isn't horrible either.

The story is one that makes you think and that fact overcomes the underlining problem of being a bit slow at times.  All in all it is a good movie and well worth watching.

3527546,4,B001D7T6CM,"Arlington Road is a film that takes some of the elements from the Oklahoma City bombing and the Ruby Ridge incident, and cleverly weaves them into a story of domestic terrorism and paranoia.  Delivering a message, the film explores the subject of manipulation.  Manipulation of one man, the historical record, and the audience.  The final result is an example of master planning, and anticipation of action, that is incredible.  In the end, we see that isolated ""facts"" when combined do not always add up to the ""truth"".
The story centers on Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), a professor of American history at George Washington University.  Two years ago, his wife, an FBI agent, was killed during a botched agency operation at a farmhouse.  Disillusioned with the Government, and left alone to raise a son, Faraday struggles to move on in his life with his new girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis).  After coming to the aid of a neighbor's son, Faraday and the boy's grateful parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), become friends.
Soon however, Faraday becomes suspicious that Oliver Lang, a structural engineer, is not what he appears.  Faraday begins to check into his background.  His girlfriend doesn't understand his suspicions, but he can't keep himself from probing into Lang's mysterious past.  Against his better judgment, he permits his son to go on a camping trip with Lang's boy.  Events begin to snowball, and Faraday finds his life spiraling out of control.  Desperation drives him to acts of near madness, attempting to prevent a disaster, and save the life of his son.  The results are atypical, to say the least.
Jeff Bridges gives a powerful performance as an obsessed man driven over the edge.  Tim Robbins, and Hope Davis are also very good, although Robbins starts to go a bit too far near the end.  Joan Cusack, was a bit harder to accept in her role.
This movie succeeds in being provocative.  For these events to be credible however, we would need to believe that human action can be predicted down to the nth degree, and with near perfect timing.

It is, however, well produced and directed.  It grabs us from the first with the neighbor boy badly injured by 4th of July fireworks....something symbolic about that.  Along with college professor Jeff Bridges, we become better acquainted with the neighbors who reminded me, while there is no marked similarity between the two films, of Rosemary's neighbors in ROSEMARY'S BABY.
This is a thriller, and during the final 20 minutes appears to be leading to a predictable though exciting climax.  Don't be fooled, though.
However, it did leave me with a question.  As in many thrillers, the bad guys are right wing zealots.  Aren't there any dangerous liberals out there?",1024876800,,936,4.929936305732484

Exciting, tense, a frightening shocker of an ending and characters who are all very flawed and not always likable. A realistic approach that helped to make it a little less of the clean-cut good vs. bad deal.

3527549,4,B001D7T6CM,"An engaging if slightly melodramatic thriller, distinguished by the bravery of its shockingly downbeat ending.  Kruger's thematically strong and neatly structured screenplay doesn't pull any punches with its climax, and that's the way it should be.  That even the most earnest opponents of terror can still be manipulated by it, and by the way it's reported, is the whole point of this story.  So I'm astonished that so many reviewers criticize the ending.  Does every film have to leave you with a warm and fuzzy glow?  Can't a movie actually be ABOUT something?  Even something important?  Of course it can, but that sometimes means the viewer has to take a pretty solid kick in the guts.  Congratulations to Kruger, Pellington and their financial backers for having the nerve to go through with this.  And shame on an audience who, in the same year, spent almost five times as much on tickets to 'Wild Wild West.'  For the love of God, America.  Wake up to yourselves before it's too late.",1023235200,,992,4.810650887573964
3527550,4,B001D7T6CM,"I've rented this on VHS before September 11th and watched it alone. I was horrified and thrilled. Now I bought it on DVD and watched it after ""the event"" with my girlfriend. The impact of it was significantly lower (which is to be expected) after I saw Twin Towers crumble into dust.
Many, many movies dealt with terrorism, but none with such courage and, I dare myself say it, vision.
Those who characherize this movie as evil, bad and malignant are the same people who can't believe the pedofilia occures among thier priests and that Church was hiding it or that goverment, politicians and big company execs care about the people, the animals or the Earth itself. Those people are repeatedly going to be hit in the face with whatever life throws their way.
This movie is serious piece of work. It's not just a movie, but a movie with a message to America and americans to stop living in the state of mind that they are above the rest of the world.
Plot in a sentence or two: a recently widowed college professor holding classes on terrorism gets new neighbour he starts suspecting he's the anti-goverment terrorist. But is it just his paranoia over his dead wife or you know what...
The premise is intriguing and the performances are good, but not great. Some pathetic acting is evident and some characters could've been developed better. Tension is built slowly and gradually, stopping here and there to (successfully) take you off track.
Nevertheless, this is an excellent movie with great finale, far better than  the most of today's Hollywood brainless junk.
The DVD itself is rather good (with alternate endings and commentary), but the sound is rather weak - it looks like it was lip-synched afterwards in the studio without real care. High tones are somewhat metallic and deep bass in non-existant. That's the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars.
Rent it first, and if you like it - buy it.

3527552,4,B001D7T6CM,"Arlington Road is a paranoid thriller, which means that the main character is paranoid (but usually correct) about the movie's villain.  In this movie, Jeff Bridges plays Micheal Faraday, a college professor who's wife was an FBI agent who died investigating a family mistakenly thought to be terrorists.  His new neighbor Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) becomes his friend after Faraday saves his kid's life one day.  But after a while, Faraday begins to notice odd occurences with Lang.  I'll stop there because I don't want to give too much away.
The acting in this movie is astounding, and Robbins once again plays a great two-faced character (I say again because I saw Antitrust first, even though that was made later).  The only downside is that the ending leaves you wondering what happens next.  I have never before seen an ending like this movie's, and I was unable to predict it until one minute before it happened (usually I can predict an ending a mile away).

3527553,3,B001D7T6CM,"I love a great thriller. While Arlington Road is not a great one, it's a decent one. It suffers from a modern-day Hollywood plague I have dubbed The Plot Virus. This malady can occur in several ways. The people who brought the script are not bright enough to see how lacking it is. Or, the script is great, but people with egos bigger than Texas can't resists tampering with it. Or, at least one powerful executive's kid didn't like it at a preview, so it gets re-editied. Whatever the cause, the results are the usually the same. The big surprise ending isn't logical, leaving one feeling deflated and a bit cheated.
Arlington Road starts off like a racehorse out of the gate. We see a dazed young boy stumbling down the middle of a suburban road. Michael Faraday [Jeff Bridges] drives up and gets out to help. Seeing that the lad is badly injured, he rushes him to the hospital. A little later, in the emergency room, he meets the boy's grateful parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang [Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack]. Turns out they are new neighbors of Faraday's. Soon, a friendship blossoms.
Faraday is already a basket case. He teaches a course in terrorism at a local university. Wouldn't you know it? His wife was killed three years earlier in a botch FBI raid on a suspected terrorist group. His young son is withdrawn, but comes back to life when he starts hanging out with the Lang's now recovered kid. As for Oliver and Cheryl, there is something not quite right about them. When Faraday gets suspicious and starts investigating, he finds himself being dragged into some very dark business.
The movie's stars - Bridges, Robbins and Cusack - are among our best actors. Bridges is typically masculine yet vulnerable here, while Robbins is his usual otherworldly self. It is Cusack who shines the brightest. Her Cheryl is a woman who says kind, warm things with just the slightest lack of sincerity on her void. She's one of those people with a helpful facade who can wreak havoc in everyone's lives.
Another plus is the musical score by Angelo Badalamenti and Tomandandy [Tom Hadiu and Andy Milburn]. For once, we are not bombarded by songs meant to fill a CD. The music here is pure thriller - loud, jagged and often cacophonous. It greatly enhances the mood of the film.
Sadly, for all the good elements in Arlington Road, we are left with that plot. In the best of thrillers, such as this year's smash hit The Sixth Sense, even if the story may is implausible, the seemingly odd and off-kilter events that occur all make sense in a logical and surprising conclusion. You look back and think, Oh, that's why this and that happened. They fooled me until the end, and I got my money's worth. An inferior script, like Arlington Road's, may have a riveting, edge-of your-seat climax, but it only serves to make what leads up to it totally improbable.

3527557,5,B001D7T6CM,"A movie like Arlington Road would probably not be made today, given the impression of sensitivity to the events of September 11 that Hollywood would like to give.  That's a pity, because many of the points made by the movie are important and timely issues worth consideration.  As one of the characters, Professor Michael Faraday (portrayed by Jeff Bridges), is a college professor teaching a course on American Terrorism, the scriptwriters have the opportunity to delve into these issues in as much detail as any Hollywood movie ever could.  Issues of personal safety, of terrorist's motivation, and of government misconduct are discussed with some sophistication; few answers are provided and even the terrorists themselves are revealed as people in search of safety.  This is not to say that Arlington Road is sympathetic to mass murderers; but it shows us the complexities of the issues.  Ultimately the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad; but that's not known to the world at large.
The acting is exceptional.  Tim Robbins has long been one of my favorite actors.  I've especially appreciated his concern for the quality of the scripts he chooses and I've managed to forgive him for Mission to Mars.  Here he is at his finest, never overacting but conveying extremes from geniality to ferocity, and his understated malice is comparable to none.  Jeff Bridges makes an excellent choice as his foil.  I've tended to underrate Bridges as an actor--he certainly hasn't exercised the judgement of Robbins where scripts are concerned--but with movies such as The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Vanishing, and the Fischer King he's proven his worth.  Here he does indulge a bit in overacting, but for the most part is very convincing.
Director Mark Pellington deserves much of the film's credit, beyond that of the acting and script.  Camerawork is terrific, and the whole is suffused with a sense of style and a personal vision that points the movie to its stunning conclusion.  That neither Bridges nor Robbins are Superstar Icons with Tom Cruise-like looks or Schwarzenegger-esque muscles makes the film all the more believable.
Finally, the music by Angelo Badalamenti (of Twin Peaks fame) perfectly assists in creating the dramatic sense.  It is not so strange as the Twin Peaks music, but nonetheless subtle and quite sophisticated, refraining from the musical equivalent of overacting.",1010275200,,2393,5.102564102564102
3527558,4,B001D7T6CM,"There is no doubt about it, ""Arlington Road"" is definitely one of the most disturbing, horrifying, shocking, heart-pounding thrillers made.  Now, after the horrifying and unspeakable terrorist attacks on this country on September 11th, this movie is even more horrifying and hard to stomach.  Be warned; this is a very shocking and uneasy movie that you will never forget, even if you want to.
""Arlington Road"" stars Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.  After meeting the all-too-perfect family, Bridges starts to suspect that his neighbor, Robbins, just might not be the standup guy that he appears to be.  After seeing some shocking and questioning clues to Robbins' past, he starts to suspect that a terrorist is living in his neighborhood and plans to do unspeakable damage and terror somewhere.  Is Bridges just plain paranoid, or has he stumbled on a conspiracy that can destroy many lives?  All I can say without giving too much, the ending will scare the hell out of you, and will leave you devastated.
This movie was already disturbing way before September 11th, but now the movie is even more shocking and horrifying.  It shows you that terror can strike anywhere and can hide behind anyone.  Terror has no true identity and has no face.  It shows us just how little we know about the world we live in.  It also shows us that sometimes the most ordinary person can do unspeakable things.
Is the movie disturbing and hard to watch?  Yes.  Will the ending either terrify or anger you?  Most likely.  But this movie succeeded in terrifying me and keeping me at the edge of my seat.  The primary goal of a thriller is to keep you guessing and on edge, no matter how gruesome and disturbing the movie may be.  I thought this was a great thriller that will never leave my mind and that it was very well directed and acted out.  Disturbing as it may be, it is a brilliant thriller that you will never forget.  There are some fine extras on the DVD, including a behind-the-scenes feature, commentary, and a theatrical trailer of the movie.  (You may want to save the trailer for when you finish the movie.  I feel that it gives away the movie a little.)
I hope this review hasn't given away too many secrets, for there are many haunting ones you will encounter in this dark film.  There are many people who will hate this movie and be angered by it.  I think it's a grim reminder that we don't live in a perfect and safe world after all.  Watch this one at your own risk.",1009411200,,2467,4.582191780821918

The film begins with Jeff Bridges's character finding a young man wandering down his street bleeding from apparent wounds from explosives. He rushes him to the hospital and is thanked heartily by the boy's parents (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), who have recently moved in on Bridges's street. Bridges portrays a college professor who teaches about conspiracies, about terrorism and modern society. His own wife had been killed in the line of duty (CIA operative), and this left him with a lot of bitterness and a son to rear on his own. As Bridges gets to know his new neighbours, he grows more and more suspicious of them and starts to delve deeper into their past. Bridges's girlfriend (played by Hope Davis) finds his suspicions to be paranoid and unfounded. However, the more he learns the more alarmed he is. He finds that these people are not at all who they claim to be. Of course it does not take long before the neighbours discover that he is digging into their lives. In fact, you get the feeling that they knew he would. Bridges is the perfect dupe and will eventually take the fall for unspeakable acts carried out by Robbins and his cohorts.

It really likes to play with your mind and even in the first few minutes or so, Arlington Road's twists and turns give you the chillie willies.  The movie explores the characters and their emotions before going into the thrills, and it worked like a charm. I wish all thrillers were like this, but Arlington Road is a rare kind, it's unique, brilliantly made and amazingly scripted. The mood and atmosphere of Arlington Road is creepy and misty and the way above-average techno horror soundtrack matches all the chilling sequences is neat. The performances are outstanding, with Jeff Bridges giving an excellent performance of a man who's paranoia is slowing killing him, while Tim Robbins is wonderfully evil and mysterious as the not-so-nice next door neighbour. Joan Cusack is a great supporting character but she should've had more to do with the evil side of things. The movie has one of the most chilling opening sequences of 1999 and the climax is brilliant and gut-punching and it is one of the best in any movie of any year.

For a moment I wondered if Mark would risk making a movie about a terrorist that isn't actually a terrorist.  But then I realized that would be a pretty boring movie.
Getting back to the end of the movie, it brought the whole thing together.  It tied in with the classes that Jeff Bridges' character taught.  He said in his classes that these terrorist that blow up buildings usually have good things going for them (just got a raise, etc.).

Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins give first-rate performances in this great thriller which tells a story about a college professor who thinks that his neighbor is a terrorist. Bridges hasn't been this good since The Big Lebowski and Robbins is absolutely terrifying as the poker-faced Oliver Lang.
The opening scene - which is one the best I've seen recently - sets the tone for the things to come. The plot is good, although there are some weaknesses. For instance the course on terrorism, which Michael Faraday (Bridges) teaches, seems a bit trivial to be taught by a history professor. (Well, what do I know, I'm a student from Europe...)
Anyway, the film does remind me of films by the great Hitchcock (see North by Northwest or The Man Who Knew Too Much...), and the claustrophobic mood is great.

3527575,4,B001D7T6CM,"""Arlington Road"" is a large breath of fresh air for the suspense genre, giving new life to the meaning of the word ""originality."" It's full of splendid ideas and plot twists, it has an ensemble of characters that we care about and watch, and it has one of the best and most satisfying movie endings I've ever seen on film. It's a story of one man's battle against his not-so-nice neighbors while also being a personal battle as he sinks into the depths of paranoia and uncertainty.
Right from the beginning, the movie begins packing in the chills. A small boy is walking down the center of a road with his hand severely bloodied and scorched, when he is snatched up by Michael Faraday, a resident of Arlington Road, and rushed off to the emergency room. The scene as a whole is charged with a unique blend of close-ups and unsettling bass impacts from the soundtrack which will set the tone for the rest of the movie. Faraday soon meets the boy's parents at the hospital, Oliver and Cheryl Lang, and converses with them about their son before returning to his home, where he confides to his girlfriend Brooke that he felt bad for not knowing the boy's name.
As the movie progresses, it takes its time in revealing the climax that is to come. We learn that Faraday is a college professor who teaches a class on terrorism in America. He once was married to an FBI agent who was killed in a massacre of right wing activists in the woods. His memories haunt him at certain moments in the film, but instead of dragging it out, these memories serve as the reason for which Faraday becomes so wrapped up in the true history and character of his neighbors, the Langs.
A mysterious letter addressed to someone of a different name also has Oliver's name on it, which leads Faraday to discover some secret blueprints when he returns the letter to his neighbor. He begins to become more uncertain and uncomfortable with the situation, and dives into a discreet investigation of Lang's past, discovering that he changed his name numerous times, and that he was once arrested for constructing pipe bombs on his father's farm. Whlie this heavily raises his suspicions of Oliver, Oliver is able to calm Faraday's notion that he is dangerous, and sets his mind at ease with an explanation of morality for his change of name.
It is at this point that the film picks up to an incredible pace, but to tell you anymore would ruin the many surprises it has to offer. Brooke begins to realize that Michael may be right in his suspicions, which leads her into danger. Faraday is given the ultimate ultimatum by Oliver, who, by this point in the movie, has every aspect of his neighbor's life bugged and tapped. He is keeping close dibs on Faraday, and it is evident by this time that Faraday is not paranoid. What he knows can destroy his life, but he is about to become someone who will be remembered on a much grander scale, and in the ending, he will serve as a model for his own teachings and opinions.
Throughout the whole movie, there is never a moment where we are not involved in some sort of race against time, in which Faraday must try to bring his criminal neighbors out into the open for the world to see. This allows for a highly introspective look at Faraday, who is seen as becoming obsessed with his notions and discoveries. The people in his life, his close friends and family, do not believe him when he tries to disclose his findings, so this leaves the intensity up to actor Jeff Bridges, who carries it on his shoulders with a stunning ability all his own.
The story as a whole is highly original and complex, involving and impacting. It's really two stories rolled into one: one is the struggle of a man to stop a deadly event from happening, and another is the struggle of the same man to deal with what he finds out and make sure that he is correct and not passing false judgement. The second story works out because actor Tim Robbins and actress Joan Cusack are able to make the audience as well as Faraday believe that they are not what he accuses them of being. They play out the actions and manipulations perfectly, and even when we realize they have a dark and frightening side, they carry it off so well.
With every other thriller basing its story on old ideas and scripts, ""Arlington Road"" is a hostile and inviting film that breaks free of the moorings of simplicity and chooses to give us a movie that keeps us in suspense until the gut-punch ending, which will leave you absolutely breathless. We care for the characters, we enjoy the story, and we get a terrifically twisted look at the lives of those who are not what they appear to be on the outside.",981763200,,4663,4.5064935064935066

Let's just say both are in the double digits, most coming in the last 20 minutes of the film.
The basic idea here is great: the mild-mannered terrorist next door. But getting from there to the film's preposterous ending in one believable piece is something these writers were simply not capable of, even if the actors were.",976406400,,569,4.7

The opening sequence is also top-notch creepiness. The story is top-notch. This was also directed by the same Mark Pellington who did The Mothman Prophecies, I reccomend buying this movie for a good solid paranoid thriller.

When Michael Faraday, played by Jeff Bridges (in one of his best roles since STARMAN), sees the boy across the road wandering aimlessly in the street, he finds his hands are horribly mutilated in a firework accident. The friendly neighbours, the Lang family, are more than grateful for Faraday's help. But are they all they seem? Michael pries into Oliver(Tim Robbins) and his life after seeing a wrongly addressed letter. Michael also teaches anti-government paranoia terrorist studies at his local university and since his wife's death in a bungled FBI raid on a patriot militia group, he is becoming increasingly obsessed with the subject. As he investigates Oliver Lang, evidence he finds makes him more scared that Lang is in reality an unhinged but professional terrorist planning a major attack in Washington. And it seems only Faraday can stop him when things get worse - the authorities refuse to belive his findings! Be warned, the ending is not what you think! You will be surprised, and this movie, while tackling an oft-told theme, will surprise you and hold your attention throughout. It comes highly recommended!",974505600,,1234,5.083743842364532

3527580,4,B001D7T6CM,"Arlington Road is a tense, taunt suspense thriller that relies on subtlety to deliver it's messages and is all the more effective for it.  Mark Pellington had taken a big step in the right direction with this one as he pits Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins against eachother as neighbors suspicious to the other's behavior.  For those of you who haven't seen the trailer - don't.  It gives away too much of the plot and seems intent on letting us know right away who the 'bad neighbor' is.  Bridges is an eccentric father, scared by the loss of his FBI agent wife, teaching a course on militant terrorist groups.  And since his wife's passing he's grown increasingly obsessed so when he begins to suspect his neighbors aren't who they seem, he's met with skepisism from his new girlfriend and FBI buddy Whitt.  Filling the roles of the all-too-perfect family are Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, who plays her role to melvolent perfection.  But are they terrorist?  After all, Bridges is the one with the motive, he blames the feds for his wife's death.  He's the one teaching these courses, he's the one growing increasingly more paranoid and the answers aren't revealed to the very end (which offers last years best twist ending in my opinion).  This movie is fabulous to look at, the photography catpures every nuance of these great actors faces which convey so much expression and unlying thoughtfulness.  The commentary track by Bridges and Pellington offers some of the best give and take moments in the short history of DVD.  For people engaged by a tightly wound, smartly written (by Ehren Krruger who also penned Reindeer Games) thriller - this one's for you.",971481600,,1660,4.7859649122807015

3527583,4,B001D7T6CM,"This is one chilling movie. It begins with the opening sequence, when we see a little boy dazed in the street, his hand bloody, and Prof. Michael  Farraday (Jeff Bridges) comes to his aid. The boy is the son of Oliver and  Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), a nice, suburban couple. But  things start to change. Behind the faade of suburbia, Farraday, already  paranoid as a terrorism expert and as the widower of an FBI agent murdered  in a Waco-style raid, starts to suspect that the Langs are quite different  that he expected. From there, the story twists and turns towards one  disturbing conclusion.
Arlington Road not only has a bizarre and twisting  story, but has a unique visual look as well, thanks to director Mark  Pellington. In fact, the film at times looks similar the the music video  for Pearl Jam's song `Jeremy', which Pellington also directed. Bridges,  perhaps the most underrated actor there is, is terrific and has a similar  role in many ways to 1994's Blown Away. Robbins is an actor who is so  versatile, that he can play both the innocent simpleton (The Hudsucker  Proxy) or a conniving senatorial candidate (Bob Roberts), here displays a  few new sides to his personality.

Its dark ending is unique, but I didn't enjoy it all  that much.  Plus there were so many analogies with the tragedy involving  the Oklahoma City bombing that it made the the film much less enjoyable.  In addition, there's an analogy with the Waco tragedy as well.
The film  at first almost validates the concerns of militia groups with government  intervention in people's lives.  Then, the movie breaks down into a  conspiracy theory mode involving an evil anti-government terrorist group  that is American-based.
I'll give it three stars because of the unique  premise and story.  But, the tragic topics that the film makes reference to  quickly add to the downward spiral of bleakness the movie falls into  towards the end.
For those who still want to see the film (there is a  fairly intense plot thread that drives a majority of the movie), I'd  recommend only renting it.  This one's not a keeper.",963619200,,1078,4.663101604278075

So, his hypersensitive state of mind means that he's probably  overreacting...or is he? Bridges's increasingly claustrophobic nightmare  continues to crush him as every effort to uncover the truth about Robbins  backfires and his friends and loved ones begin to see him as the stranger.  Superb lead performances, with Bridges producing an emotional tour de  force, and an unflagging plot dragged me by the scruff of the neck towards  an apocalyptic climax which left me feeling drained, but strangely  satisfied. This is not a cosy, feet-up film, not a movie to watch if your  penchant is for safe blockbuster thrillers where everything turns to roses  in the end.

After that, the movie takes some time to show the characters lives and explain everything. If you  don't really pay attention this could be a bit boring but it is needed to  make this movie so good and suspensefull.  But this also makes this a movie  wich is very thrilling and good when you see it for the first time, but not  to watch it for a second time.
But the best thing of the movie is, like a  lot people are saying, the ending. It is very disturbing but logic. I won't  say more about it than that it is the best ending I have seen in a movie  for quite a long time.
The performances of Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins  are very good but especialy Joan Cusack is very good though it is a bit  strange to see her in this kind of movie. But she is very believable as  Cheryl Lang.

I believe the cause for the lame box office  earnings and subpar reviews was for an intelligent and well thought out  ending.  These days, a predicatble and happy ending is necessary in order  for a movie to become well liked.  With a movie like Arlington Road, you  don't get a sense of a real ""resolution"" to the characters.  I  believe that this ending was perfect to the way that the beginning was  built up.
In other words, this movie would have cheated itself and its  viewers had it concluded with a happy ending and the bad guys being sent to  jail.  The beauty of this movie, and why I think it stands out above the  pack of many other movies in the same genre (i.e. ""The Siege""),  is the fact that we realize, sometimes the good guys don't win.

If this movie was so suspensefull, why was I  fforwarding through most of the final 30 minutes?  I started to get annoyed  early at the corny coincedences that you see in bad suspense movies.  Then  it got worse when I was able to easily guess what would always happen next,  until the end, which I will concede would have been great with a half way  decent lead up.  Finally, the movie became unbearable when certain simple  scenes were made excrutiatingly long.  Just add alot of suspense music and  some car chases and you have most of the last 15 minutes.

Instead  you get an ending which, without revealing it, I will say is deeply  disturbing.  It left me severely rattled for a long time after watching it.  Not a scary ending, just a chilling one.
The only real problem I had  with this film was Tim Robbins.  He is just not an actor I believed as a  villain.  He didn't exude evil the way some movie bad guys do; and this was  too much of a stretch from his previous work.

However, this film is not  one of those.  You don't often find me saying ""wow"" to the movie  that I have just watched, but this film is an exception.  It was the most  satisfying story that I have ever seen.  I like movies that actually have  meanings, unlike movies that are made just for the profit purposes.  I like  movies that blows me away.  And this was one of those.  Tim Robbins like  always, was amazingly attractive.  Though as scary as his character was, I  was attraced to him than ever before.

The sound and  colors on the DVD are good but in terms of sound this movie is more of a  dialogue driven movie, so don't expect any major sound effects until the  action begins near the end of the movie.
As for extra's, there is the  commentary and the featurette which you may want to listen to and learn why  the director did what he did.  This is one shining point for why to buy the  DVD release.  After listening to the director explain his reasoning, the  movie made sense.
It's a good plot, don't get me wrong.  The movie has a  lot of action, it holds your attention throughout the movie.
Prepare for  a story that can be based on reality.

One of my other friends has complained that  this movie is slow-moving, and that may very well be true but I find that  the reason it may seem that way at times is due to the highly intricate  character development that goes on during the movie.  I normally like Tim  Robbins and I think he was even more stupendous in this movie than usual.  The work of Jeff Bridges was beyond anything I have seen him do in the  past.

While THE NEGOTIATOR was the surprise hit of 1998, ARLINGTON ROAD,  at least I hope so, is going to be the sleeper of 1999-2000.
The first 10  minutes of the movie reveal a great filmmaker who knows how to create  uneasiness in the audience. Uneasiness is the adequate word to qualify the  state of mind of the viewer during the whole movie. ARLINGTON ROAD could  have been another film exploring the activities of the extremist groups  that have recently appeared in the U.S.A. but, fortunately, the movie is  more an above-average thriller than a political and social study.
Secret  conspiracies are one of the themes Hollywood has treated by the dozen since  50 years ; communists, KKK, CIA, FBI, The Organisation, intellectuals and  martians's plots have been discovered and heavily punished by our favorite  heroes. It seems that there will always be a worm to be crushed in the  american apple.
Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges give performances that will  linger a long time in my memory, along with the strange character played by  Joan Cusack. All in all, ARLINGTON ROAD deserves to be considered as one of  the rare good american movies of 1999.

3527612,4,B001D7T6CM,"Contrary to what you may think initially, nothing happens by coincidence on ""Arlington Road.""  Outstanding performances by Jeff Bridges (As Michael Faraday) and Tim Robbins (Oliver Lang) highlight this taut thriller about  terrorism in America, a disturbing film instilled with a sense of loss,  fear and paranoia.  Director Mark Pellington perhaps does not mine this  vein to the depths, but there is still a silver lining in this movie, which  contains elements of two of Alfred Hitchcock's classics, ""The Man Who Knew  Too Much,"" and ""North By Northwest.""  Had this film been made forty years  ago, in fact, Hitchcock would have been at the helm and we would have had  James Stewart instead of Bridges and Richard Widmark in place of Robbins.  When Jeff Bridges stars in a thriller, you can usually bet that the project  is going to be a cut above the average fare of the genre, and this one is  no exception, arguably his best of it's kind since ""Jagged Edge.""  This is  a riveting film, and the tension builds steadily throughout as we uncover,  along with Faraday, the dark secrets which ultimately lead to an explosive  climax.  The excellent supporting cast includes Joan Cusack, Hope Davis and  Robert Gossett.  A trip to ""Arlington Road"" is a jolt to the senses and may  cause you to stop and rethink a few things about your life.  At the very  least, you're going to want to finally meet that neighbor who moved in  across the street last year.",953596800,,1455,4.751004016064257

3527614,2,B001D7T6CM,"Given the events of the past decade, ""Arlington Road""  is certainly timely enough to scare an audience.  The movie adeptly plays on our paranoia -- who WOULDN'T be suspicious of the robotically smiling Tim  Robbins and Joan Cusack, let alone their daughter who apparently stepped  out of  ""Children of the Corn""  to slum it in the suburbs?  The  set-up is wacky:  this creepy family moves in next-door to a professor of  terrorism  (portrayed by Jeff Bridges).  The overplotted movie soon renders  that coincidence less stunning.  I found myself doubting that the suburban  terrorists could so easily jerk our hero around like a puppet.  As played  (brilliantly, in my opinion)  by Bridges, this character is too high-strung  and downright mentally disturbed to be manipulated into pursuing his own  investigation of his neighbors . . . I mean, this guy looks as if he can  barely tie his shoes.  Bridges'  performance makes you uncomfortable  because his grief over his dead wife is real in an ugly, non-leading-man  way.  It's a brave job.  Robbins, on the other hand, with his militia  haircut and monotone voice doesn't convey normalcy for one second -- it's a  typical  ""villain""  portrayal.  Acting like a real human being  would've profited the film, adding to the suspense:  as in, is he a  terrorist or isn't he?  Bridges, with his roiling eyeballs and sweaty face,  is the prime source of suspense herein.
The ending, by the way, is a  cheap shot.  The purpose seems to be to shock the audience rather than  follow the logic of the story.",952300800,,1548,4.848837209302325
3527615,3,B001D7T6CM,"I'm still making my mind about this movie, to know if it is good or not. There are some sequences very good, but Bridges'acting is very poor. Robbins is always good. I liked the fact that ""evil"" won this  time.",951177600,,210,4.25

The overwhelming impression he leaves is  that he spends the whole movie screaming his lines or crying....he doesn't  of course, but watching him go through this movie is torture.  It's  impossible to understand how the director couldn't see that the performance  was horrible.
The plot is highly contrived.  One can only assume that  Jeff Bridge's character must not have a clue about the subject matter that  he teaches because everything catches him by surprise.  That would be more  believeable if the main character wasn't supposed to have spent  considerable time studying this stuff.  But then given the plot all  semblance of logic and reason is thrown out the window about 10 minutes  into the movie.  The movie veers from creating a subversive, paranoid  vision of suburbia to a car chase laden, fight scene action movie.  And the  ""punch in the gut ending"" plays out in ridiculous fashion as it's  only patently obvious what's happening and yet no one takes any action.

3527618,3,B001D7T6CM,"I only have one complaint about Arlington Road; If Jeff Bridges' character Faraday would've cried one more time, I would've  smacked the screen. True, his character went through living hell with the death of his FBI agent  wife. Yet, seeing his performance reminded me of one of his earlier movie  roles as an alcoholic.
Other performances were top notch and creepy to  say the least. Tim Robbins is one of those versatile actors who can play  either villain or hero without a hitch. Joan Cusack turns in an almost  evil-comical performance as a cross between a Stepford wife and June  Cleaver; kind of a lunatic mom with a warm apple pie in one hand up front  while concealing a blunt sharp object behind her for the kill. Though, her  character is far from benign I was surprised to see her use her usual  comical appeal for such an evil character with hidden agendas.
After  seeing the featurette included on the dvd, I now understand the shocking  climax of the movie. Without being accused as a reviewer of giving away the  ending I can only say that in a way I'm glad the writer or director decided  to go with a non-conventional ""Hollywood"" ending...",947894400,,1157,4.635467980295567

Arlington Road is a well-done thriller about  domestic terrorism and paranoia that seems very appropo for our times  (forget the anti-Clinton rantings of the idiot, er, reviewer below who  appears more interested in promoting some paranoid right wing agenda than  in honestly  and objectively reviewing a movie).  The ending is quite  surprising and alone justifies watching this movie.  Robbins and Bridges  both turn in very good performances, as does Joan Cusack as the wife of a  terrorist bomber.

Initially I was intrigued, only to be disgusted by an improbable sequence of events at the  end. Without giving away the ending (which is rather interesting), I can  only say that the final car chase is a ridiculous sequence of events that  could probably never happen in D.C. without someone getting caught by the  police. Furthermore, how the movie's antagonist could have set up this  chase to lead to the movie's unpredictable end result is also  puzzling..
For what it's worth, this film was enjoyable, a good romp I  suppose, with a very bleak message at the end. It did keep me guessing most  of the way through.
Sound was moderate, nothing special even in Dolby 5.1  with a home theater system. Picture quality was nice and crisp.
For those  of you who own JVC DVD players, be advised, accessing the special features  section of this DVD can lead to some strange hardware malfunctions. When I  tried watching the ""Alternate Ending"" my player froze, then would  not play this movie at all.

The friendship grows but becomes suspect when it appears the neighbor has a dark past and current secret life.  The theme of the plot is about domestic terrorism.

The first 2/3 of this movie is excellent.  The plot is believable, the pacing is spot on, the acting is great.  But the last 1/3 of the film becomes an action movie cliche.  Suddenly, the antagonists can sneak around undetected, can suddenly appear out of the blue behind the good guys at critical moments and can manipulate events to their favor contrary to believe-ability.  The characters, which were third dimensional, believe-able and sympathetic suddenly become one dimensional and stereotypical.  The actors go over the top and lose all credibility with the exception of Jeff Bridges who is excellent throughout.  The final ending of the film, however, is incredible.  The ending is unexpected and one of the best of any film I've ever seen.

One major thing I hate about this movie is the anti-Christian overtone in the movie.  I did not catch it (which is why it is an overtone) until listening to the commentary.  The director of the film keeps pointing out his anti-Christian rhetoric during the commentary which makes Jeff Bridges say ""You don't like Christians?"".  The director replies with a smirky sarcasm in his voice ""I like Christians.  Christians are good.  Christian are good people.""  This is followed by a long silence in the commentary like an elephant just entered the room.  The director's voice is just full of sarcasm when making his ""Christians are good people"" comment.
