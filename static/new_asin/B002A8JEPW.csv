but this is a great drama more with both legal and medical aspects and shows how doctors cover up. the only problem is that the seller, AsianMotionPicturesEnterprise' isn't as good as i thought, the seller is nice but liar,
its clear they pirate the cds, they sent 3 times 3 set of this dvd and same problem occurred, you can see from the back around the center, it was burned, when you try to watch the last episode, it freezes constantly or boxes up then freezes and skips.",1268265600,,672,4.2578125
