7795191,5,0983577617,"This  Is the most valuable item that I have in my possession. Absolutely highly recommended for all Seth readers. Lynda has brought to light the most fundamental teachings of Seth, with great clarity and logic. Her lecture is easy to follow but has so much depth and understanding of the Seth material that it leaves the viewer finally able to understand what Seth was trying to teach us all those years ago. This DVD is a MUST if you want to expand your knowledge of reality. For those who Have not read any Seth I recommend starting with ""The Nature of Personal Reality"" a Seth book, before getting this DVD.",1423785600,4,610,4.545454545454546
