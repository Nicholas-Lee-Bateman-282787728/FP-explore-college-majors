6381507,5,B00JM2ZDVI,"This is a fun collection of commercials of yesteryear, bound to make you feel like there's an antenna on your roof again. Watch Rory Raccoon push Post Corn Flakes, Don Knotts peddle dog food, and Joe Namath sell sheets. See long gone products like That's My Color Hair Dye, Vigran Vitamins, and Wondra Lotion. Of course many ads are for products still around today, such as Clearasil, Crest,Lipton Soup and Joy Detergent. The animation, the jingles, the pitchmen, it's just fun stuff.",1279929600,31,484,4.914634146341464

8652309,5,B00JM2ZDVI,"This ia a fun collection of commercials from TV's bygone era. As a television addicted baby boomer, I recognize a lot of these products, some of which no longer exist. A fun trip down memory lane.",1409011200,2,196,4.472222222222222
8652310,2,B00JM2ZDVI,"It's ok.  As a child of the 70's I was hoping to see a lot more than I actually recognized.  There are a lot of old commercials that are not national, so I'd never seen or heard of them.  They are also not separated like TV episodes; they seem to be strung together.  All in all, not thrilled, but not horrible.",1409011200,2,311,4.049180327868853
8652311,4,B00JM2ZDVI,The selection of commercials fulfilled my needs. Resolution is grainy but that was expected due to the origin of the recordings.,1394150400,7,128,5.142857142857143
8652312,5,B00JM2ZDVI,"This dvd has some of the best commercials from the 60s and 50s. I felt like a kid again watching these. Back then the products advertised were so simple, cigarettes, soda, cereal. Now aday I see ads for C-Pap devises and artificial joints, yuck. Oh, to go back to these days.",1382572800,7,275,4.411764705882353
8652313,1,B00JM2ZDVI,"I was looking for the humorous Alka Seltz'er, and Volkswagen commercials. Not a one. Mostly cigarette commercials, and many of the same brand",1382400000,3,141,5.173913043478261
8652314,3,B00JM2ZDVI,"this was interesting if you want to study old commercials but there was no index/menu, no categorization of videos, no way to go back and find something you wanted to study again.

Would have been great to have some ""set up"" dialog so that you could have understood context of each product or at least each category..

so it is worth the small price I paid and it is interesting but the clips are just slopped together in no particular order.",1360195200,6,442,4.444444444444445
8652315,5,B00JM2ZDVI,Bought this for a Christmas present for my Daughter and Son-in-law. Their reaction was really great. They were surprised and loved it!,1357084800,4,134,5.136363636363637
