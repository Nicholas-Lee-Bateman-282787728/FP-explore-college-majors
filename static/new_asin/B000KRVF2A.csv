8158879,5,B000KRVF2A,"I used to watch this constantly when I was a kid, and would recommend it to any parent. The classic animation infused with the timeless music is a wonderful way to entertain a kid for endless hours (as my parents quickly found out). To this day, when I hear ""Baby Love"" by the Supremes I think of Dumbo, and ""When I Grow Up to Be a Man"" by The Beachboys, I think of Donald Duck and his nephews racing around in a 60's era sports car. Its hard to tell by the cover but this movie is a real gem that I can say for certain, from my own experience, is an invaluble addition to any parents movie collection.",1180828800,8,602,4.067226890756302
