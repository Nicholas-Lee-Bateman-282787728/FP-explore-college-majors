8581671,3,B00CH30NYQ,"It's hard to tell where the main feature(s) end and the bonus material begins on this odd DVD.  You get full-length bio of mystery writer Mickey Spillane, with a commentary track featuring Max Allan Collins, author of the ""Road to Perdition"" graphic novel.  Then there's the ""lost"" TV pilot to ""Mike Hammer"" starring Brian Keith.  Three short films including ""A Matter of Principal"" [sic?] and ""Eliot Ness: An Untouchable Life"".  Add a handful of trailers, a making-of featurette, and a 1954 recording of Mickey Spillane singing ""Tonight My Love"".  If you're ever nostalgic for the days of Mike Hammer and the hard-boiled detective story, this may make for an enjoyable evening.",1382659200,,678,5.072072072072072
