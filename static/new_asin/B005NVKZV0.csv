4849803,5,B005NVKZV0,It is great to find these online. In fact that is the ONLY place I can find this series at. I order them for my parents who love this show! I will buy again for sure.,1358294400,,166,3.638888888888889
4849804,5,B005NVKZV0,"There is a reason this series lasted for 24 seasons, it's funny.  The neat thing about old people is they can do some of the sillest things and still survive.  In ""Last of the Summer Wine"" there were cast changes, but the location and most of the characters stayed the same.  And their antics from week to week, although sometime a little outrageous, was never not funny.  Good clean comedy is hard to find, but this show has it from Series 1 thru Series 24.  Buy it and enjoy.  I did.",1357171200,3,485,4.274725274725275

8480780,5,B005NVKZV0,"For me, very personal opinion, only Jeeves and Wooster competes with this series.

The complete series is not available in the US format. Since I watch them on a Windows computer, I can fill in the gaps by ordering the versions from the UK, Australia and New Zealand.",1455494400,,267,4.5625
8480781,5,B005NVKZV0,Greatest show ever,1433548800,,18,5.333333333333333
8480782,5,B005NVKZV0,This is a British Program I really enjoy.  There are quite a few British programs I have purchased.  We only see them on PBS.  Then what we watch on PBS depends on how much they can afford.  So you might get in to a program and then all of a sudden PBS drops it.,1403136000,,262,3.7962962962962963
8480783,5,B005NVKZV0,"This is the greatest, and longest-running of all British comedies, and we are collecting the series as they become available.  We look forward to collecting the entire set.  This would be a wonderful gift for anyone who enjoys beautiful countryside in rural England, and the antics of a cantankerous group of characters who made it through the depression and WWII.  You do need to invest in a DVD player which handles Region 2, but this is a nominal investment to allow you enjoy such remarkable British shows.",1371859200,3,510,4.839080459770115
