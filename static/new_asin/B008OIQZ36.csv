5174550,5,B008OIQZ36,"These are the 32 early and last of the  half-hour  1960-1961  b/w  episodes..and they are also some of  the best. Before they went to  one hour and color  to  keep up with the other shows on the other networks. As Milburne Stone said in a TV-Guide article ."".at last, there were guest stars that carried the episodes and only at the last minute Matt came in to save everyone and shoot the bad guys."" This Sixth Season  is the latest  full year collection to be relased to the public. Now,will we be seeing the 7th. Season and the first l-hour b/w shows of  34  from  1961-1962 which were also great, except they  were  starting to cut  some  action scenes  with more dialogue  supposed to flesh-out the characters.l And yes...This is another great  GUNSMOKE classic early TV  collection.",1354320000,19,787,4.598540145985401

5174613,5,B008OIQZ36,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

5174746,5,B008OIQZ36,"""GUNSMOKE"" was one of the best made for TV western series for 20 years. It is worth reviewing its episodes.",1412553600,,107,4.4
5174747,5,B008OIQZ36,In my opinion Gunsmoke is one of the all-time classic western shows. The shows are well written so the whole family can enjoy them. Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference.

5174752,5,B008OIQZ36,"I am really HAPPY with this second volume for SEASON 6 of GUNSMOKE. The episodes were extremely high quality and each and every story was exceptionally well done. This edition marks the END of the GUNSMOKE half-hour format, before they moved to hour-long episodes. The sparkling Black and White photography still maintains a solid visual edge, giving each episode a stark, gritty quality. The stories are also well compsoed and tightly written. I am a bit disappointed that there are no real 'extras' to be found ( except a few original sponsor commercials) but at these prices (around $20.) the overall entertainment value of these packages is so high that I really can't complain. LOTS of great action, drama and character humor in each and every episode, making viewing GUNSMOKE a terrific way to end your work day.",1392940800,6,818,4.934782608695652

5174766,5,B008OIQZ36,"This was a great series of how men and women survived in the post civil war days of Dodge City, Kansas. Life was cheap and so was the booze at the Longbranch. No episode reflected this better than the 1st episode of Season 6, Vol. 2. It was sarcastically titled Love Thy Neighbor. It was an excellent half-hour of retribution with a cast to die for: Jeannette Nolan, Harry Dean Stanton, Jack Elam, and Warren Oates. It was amazing how much story the intelligent writers could cram into 25 minutes.

There were tons of westerns in the 50's and 60's, but GUNSMOKE was the gold standard.",1384128000,,584,4.509433962264151
5174767,5,B008OIQZ36,"Gunsmoke was a great series.  I enjoy the series better in black and white (I think they went to color in season 11) and I like them better with Chester (through season 9).

5174786,5,B008OIQZ36,"In order to save time, I would like to cover all the seasons in general with this review.  I can only say that I grately appreciated how the producers of this series researched that way of life before making all their episodes.  It was as true to life as possible with a touch of flare for the viewing audience.  If you want to get a taste of how life was like back in the 1800's, just watch a few episodes of Gunsmoke.  You'll appreciate all of the modern conveniences in your life a bit more.  The actors are seasoned to the series and work together like a well oiled machine.  When you work with someone for 20 years, you concider yourself almost married to them, knowing their personalities and strong points, as well as their weaknesses.  That is what made this series so special.  There was substance because of their long careers together.  It's nice to see how everyone had the same goal in mind, to make ""Gunsmoke"" as realistic as possible.  That's what made it so enjoyable for me.  You get to see how a piece of the past  really was.  It draws the viewer into it's plot with gentle persuasion and captivates you with suspense.  You feel like you are right there in the midst of it.  You will cry and laugh and celebrate their lives as you see the actors aging with grace everystep of the way.  Only a few  series, this being one of them, were able to captivate us with heart tugs and emotions as we too progressed in age right along with them.  They became our friends and to some, family.  Now I find myself watching these old programs and thinking back to my childhood, remembering how my parents would tune into their favorite show on TV every Monday evening to watch Festus and old Doc get into another fracas over Festus' wild conclusions, or when will Marshall Dillon propose to Miss Kitty, (a big unanswered question mark left  in that series). It brings me back to a happier time in my life too.  I remember when my parents were younger and able bodied and I was in grade school with lots of time to kill during summer vaction.  It was more than just a TV show to many folks. You won't see space ships blow up the earth or endless car chases all over the city, but you will see realalistic situations with real emotions of how life was for our forefathers 150 years ago.  I would like to end my review with my recommendation,  I can assure you, if you choose to purchase this series, you will not be disappointed.  You will see for yourself why it lasted 2o years.",1371772800,2,2483,4.368995633187773
5174787,5,B008OIQZ36,"Fifty years plus since first shown, ""Gunsmoke"" still holds up as one of the best television series ever.  Wonderful characters, consis-tently good stories and polished production values make this terrific old series still very relevant today.

5174806,5,B008OIQZ36,I really enjoyed seeing James Arness improve year by year.  He is the Matt Dillon I remember in this Season.  He made the role come alive and in Season 6 he still was in most of the shows.,1363219200,,188,3.9210526315789473

5174813,4,B008OIQZ36,"Todays shows are basically horrible.  No plot and only violence and gore.  Even this being a ""Gun"" show, it limits the violence and you actually feel sad for the person that was killed.  NOneed for splattered GUTS!",1357689600,,214,4.72972972972973
8529339,5,B008OIQZ36,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This episode, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive years.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1529366400,,803,5.083333333333333

8529344,5,B008OIQZ36,This was the last season of the half hour shows and also marked Chester's last season. I like all of these seasons better than the hour long ones. I could never warm up to Festus. Th ehalf hour ones like the Rifleman quickly get to the plot and conclusion.,1504483200,,256,4.244897959183674
