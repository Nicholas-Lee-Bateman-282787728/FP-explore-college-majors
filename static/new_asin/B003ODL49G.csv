8401608,2,B003ODL49G,The footage was really old (though the cover looks recent) and the DVD would skip and stop playing in the middle of it.,1331510400,,119,4.217391304347826
8401609,1,B003ODL49G,"This is an unauthorized amateur documentary that is POOR in every way except the jacket cover photo!
This is a quasi-professional documentary with random interviews from the local radio station jocks and some kids that grew up in Christina's hometown that don't even really know her. It is the WORST documentary I have ever paid for! There is NO Music and the documentary keeps playing a scene divider with the same six or eight images over and over and over again in between interview bites!!!!! The sound quality is terrible, the subjects interviewed are BORING and I am only taking my time to write this to purge my anger for having ever asked for this as a gift. I can assure you that Christina is sad for her fans who have spent good money on this. It's so terrible and embarrassing for her that I don't even want it in my personal collection so I'm going to donate my copy the the public library! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1295654400,2,939,4.595238095238095
8401610,1,B003ODL49G,"I  just received the dvd today and I was so excited hoping to see current live show's or concert of her, but I was wrong by looking at the cover of this DVD which looks much more current than what I saw in the dvd. The footages are old interviews of her friends, people working with her, and herself. Don't expect to have quality hd in there, I think the only nice thing it's the DVD cover that looks nice. However, I am a true fan and already know her bio and all her discography and so on... I think Amazon should of put more information on the content of this dvd. This is what appears on the back of the DVD for people that might be interested buying it:

Christina Aguilera - The Girl Next Door takes a look back at Christina's staggering career and music and explores quite how she has managed to become such a driving force behind her own success. Including numerous interviews with the girl herself, contributions from her nearest and dearest and previously unseen film footage, photographs and archive material, this programme provides the most insightful assessment yet to emerge on this remarkable woman.",1285545600,17,1115,4.57
