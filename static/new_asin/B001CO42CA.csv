3514979,5,B001CO42CA,"From what others have said, this looks to be the final ""GOLDEN COLLECTION"" for WB cartoons. The good news is that more toons are being planned to be released, but under a different title.

I haven't seen this particular set yet, but can anyone TRULY give these ""Golden Collections"" anything LESS than 5 stars? Year-after-year they have been truly amazing. Not only with the great job WB has done in cleaning up each cartoon, but with all the extras they've provided as well.

But how can you NOT include in a ""Golden Collection"" the likes of Sniffles, including that great one where he waits up for Santa to come at Christmas time? And how about the two dogs that visit the ""home of the future"" and pretty much get into all kinds of trouble with the robot-vac and more? And how about the little minah(sp)-bird that comes out of the top-hat? Or the classic ""I ONLY HAVE ICE FOR YOU?"" Or the classic one with the chick named Toots that can't eat the worm because ""he looks too much like Frankie Sinatra""?

There are MANY great cartoons left to be seen. Let's hope WB doesn't forget about them. And like someone else said, let's hope that if they ARE released in future sets, that WB doesn't ""fill"" the set with toons already released in prior ""Golden Collections"".

I'm looking forward to this set. Like I said, let's hope WB gives us a lot more to look forward to, especially of the toons we all know and love.",1218758400,10,1409,4.470817120622568
3514980,3,B001CO42CA,"There are some really great cartoons in this set, especially the one-shots like Rocket-Bye Baby, Wild Wife, Chow Hound, The Hole Idea, etc.  Unfortunately, WB has continued their trend of adding filler cartoons that they began with volume 3 of this line.  A whole disc devoted to Bosko and Buddy is inexcusable in the last set of a collection that has snubbed Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe LePew (and where's Hippity Hopper and Sylvester Jr? - one unrestored bonus cartoon doesn't cut it).  So buy this if you're a WWII buff or a completist, otherwise stick with the Spotlight Collection to avoid wasting your money on a whole disc full of Bosko and Buddy cartoons.",1217894400,,660,4.771929824561403
3514981,5,B001CO42CA,"I'm kind of sad that this is the last WB golden collection...although the cartoons on here are really cool,especially the war time cartoons,most of which are too P.I. for todays television,and some which feature Adolf Hitler being spoofed,I'm also happy that they finally decided to put the earliest WB cartoons like ""smile darn ya smile"" and the bosko stuff ,the only thing that bothers me about this collection (and the last 5 volumes) is the lack of Tex Avery cartoons and the fact that there hasn't been a spotlight disc on his cartoons,each of the past volumes had a disc dedicated to a WB director,unfortuantly no Tex Avery disc,now this could be either bad news or good news,they may think that his stuff is too P.I. and decide NEVER to release them,(which would be the bad news,of course)OR maybe they are planning a Tex Avery Box set,which I hope is the case here,they released the Droopy set but I want to see a box set of his WB and MGM cartoons released.maybe a 4 disc WB set with 60 cartoons then a 4 disc MGM set with 60 cartoons,(with no droopy)....",1217808000,5,1064,4.575916230366492
3514982,5,B001CO42CA,What's the betting that the new packaging coming next year will include a few new cartoons mixed with cartoons collected in the Golden Collection?,1217721600,2,146,5.125
3514983,5,B001CO42CA,"This set includes the familiar ""Looney Tune All-Stars"" disc, which usually has the most variety. However, it also has a disc of the earliest Looney Tune cartoons, those from the early 30's that often use tunes from WB feature length films as themes to build the cartoon around. For example, ""I Love a Parade"" was written to popularize the now-forgotten WB pre-coder ""Manhattan Parade"". Ironically, all of the music was excised from Manhattan Parade and the cartoon winds up being more musical than the film it was supposed to parody.
Also different this year, we get a disc of cartoons with patriotic themes. We've had some of these before, but not a whole disc devoted to it, and not one that mixes MGM cartoons with the WB ones.
Finally, there is an ""Assorted Nuts"" disc that has some greatly requested entries on it. I'm looking forward to the 70 minute documentary on Mel Blanc. There have been features on Mel Blanc on the previous Golden Collections, but none that was this long. All in all, a worthy tribute to the Looney Tunes and the final entry in this series. However, as others have mentioned, there will be more MGM and WB cartoons coming, just in a different series and hopefully with as high a quality as we've gotten over the last six years with the Golden Collection series.",1217721600,7,1291,4.666666666666667
3514984,5,B001CO42CA,"Sufferin Succotash!! The finale golden collection, but hakuna matata (whoops pardon me wrong studio) it was said on tvshowsondvd.com that the looney tunes will be back in 2009, but probably in a different set. Besides, they fi ah say they finally included two foghorn leghorn cartoons among other things and whatever else is included on the DVD is what it is. Beggers can't be choosers.

So play it again warners, that's not all folks!!

I finished viewing it and it was great, but of course, could be better I was really impressed by the fact that you did not have to sit through those boring disclaimers they give you the option to skip them which works for me. However,  I wish they included more foghorn among other things, but lets see what turns out next year.",1217376000,5,766,4.617647058823529

PLUS fifteen other shorts yet to be announced! Although this is the last in the Golden Collection series don't despair; WB has many more on the way under different titles. My personal favorite is Punch Trunk about a miniature elephant that hitchiked in a bunch of bananas and wound up in the city and appeared virtually everywhere and blasted the skies with his tiny elephant noise, incl one man's bird bath!
Martian Through Georgia is fabulous about a lonely Martian who comes to earth searching for companionship and tries desperately to fit in but no matter what he does, people still see him as a monster and tell him to go home! Monster go home! Tearfully he does and finds love on his own planet.
Now Hear This is very surreal and is told with sound and picture a la Gerald Mc Boing Boing, just wonderful to see and hear.
Cannot WAIT until october! I already ordered it! God Bless Chuck Jones!",1216684800,145,2315,4.401869158878505

Warner Brothers announced last week that ""Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Volume 6"" will be the final DVD release of the GC series.

The studio's announcement included this description:
 ""We've saved the best for last--more of your favorite Looney Tunes--your wish is our command. The concluding release from the Golden Collection Series is a 4-disc set with 60 more of the most looneytic Looney Tunes ever unleashed. Plus, 15 bonus shorts to make this the biggest collection of Looney Tunes ever! Indeed, some have never before been on home video!""

Warner IS going to continue releasing Looney Tunes on DVD, but is not ready to state any details. So, we WILL see more new remasters of these great cartoons on DVD in the future, but not using the label ""Golden Collection.""

Volume Six has a October 21, 2008 street date. Sporting 75 shorts, with 60 being featured cartoon titles, and another 15 items listed as ""bonuses"" (and not yet named) this looks to be a fine way to close out the GC releases. Also, WB has not revealed the ""extras"" that, most surely, will be included.

One of my best-loved ""Looney"" quotes seems appropriate here...

Porky:
""Oh, son of a bi-bi, son of a bi-bi... son of a gun!
Ha-ha-ha! I bet you thought I was going to say 'sa-sa-sa... son of a bitch', didn't ya?!""

But thankfully (and hopefully)... ""That's NOT all, folks!""

3515008,3,B001CO42CA,"Not bad, and good to see some early classics finally make it to disc. However, I wish Warners would focus more on their 1937-46 period for an entire set (which they've yet to do), which is unquestionably the studio in it's peak form. I'm thinking mostly of Robert Clampett's Porky series, various Tex Avery cartoons, and various hilarious one shots they've still yet to put to disc.

Disc 4 in this set represents perfectly one of the main problems with these Warners collections. The fourth disc is loaded with awful latter day (late 50s-early 60s) cartoons in a horrendous UPA style (""Norman Normal"" or ""Now Hear This"" represent, in my opinion, the studio at its nadir). There was a clear drop in quality at the studio after 1946 (due both to changes in the cartoonists union, as well as the gradual negative influence of UPA). From 1947 onward, the quality only gets worse and worse, until by the late 50s the cartoons become painful to see, and very sad given the high bar previously set. There are exceptions obviously, but for the most part, those latter toons never approach the quality of the pre-1947 toons. These Warner cartoon sets, for whatever reason, don't focus enough on that period. I find it hard to believe good prints don't exist, since the Bosco and Foxy material from the early 30s looks terrific.

I admire Chuck Jones, but at times you'd think he was the only director Warners ever had. After awhile, his style wears thin when it's all seen time and time again. I'd love to see a set featuring the entirety of Clampett's output (particularly the Porky toons from the late 30 to the early 40s), and other, more logical collections from the late 30s through 1946.

Inexplicably, the 1938 Avery classic ""Page Miss Glory"" sits in the middle of disc 4, which makes zero sense and forces you to skim through some pretty terrible stuff to get to it. It's quite jarring to jump from, say, a 1958 Warners toon to one from 1938  the difference in quality and background detail is astounding. Hard to believe they're from the same studio.

Sigh. Perhaps one day there will be HD on demand packages of these cartoons and we'll be able to choose the years and individual cartoons we want to see. Until then, fans of the classic period such as myself will have to suffer with Warner's infatuation with their post-1947 period.

Having said that, kids will enjoy this set, as well as adults who aren't as familiar or concerned with the studio's history. My review is probably more suited to hard core fans.",1491609600,3,2514,4.663656884875847

3515019,5,B001CO42CA,"To my mind the greatest work done by the Termite Terrace crew was done in the 40's, and this compilation is loaded with toons from that era.  Maybe it was because of the desperate war years when people really needed a laugh, but for whatever the reason, everyone (Jones, Avery, Freleng and especially Bob Clampett) seemed to do their best work.  The cartoons had an adult sensibility and the artwork was rich and detailed and the emphasis was on wacky.  I make no bones about my special fondness for Bob Clampett's efforts.  I find his cartoons to be the funniest, the most adult, the best drawn and animated, the most anarchic and wackiest and absolutely unbound in going for the joke.  But everyone else working at Warner's were really on their game in the 40's, especially the war years.

Like many others, I grew up with the Warner Bros.cartoons on Saturday.  There I was introduced to all the characters done in the 50's and 60's era style.  Loved them.  Then, on occasion, a cartoon from the 40's would turn up and I was amazed at how different they were from the regular fare from Freleng and Jones.  That's when I discovered Clampett, who had left Warner's by the 50's.  I also noted that the work of Jones and Freleng were different then too.  Richer and funnier to me. Anyway, that era became my preference and I am glad that this collection has a load of them.",1461283200,,1371,4.528455284552845

On the other hand, cartoons from the maligned 1960s are well chosen with the Oscar-nominated ""Now Hear This"" among several earnest one-shots including the handsome ""Wild Wild World"" with its modern Stone Age setting, the Thurber-esque ""Bartholomew versus the Wheel,"" and ""Norman Normal"" (best of the Bill Hendricks era). In between are propaganda cartoons from WW2 with the very entertaining ""Herr Meets Hare,"" vividly animated ""Russian Rhapsody"" and stylish ""The Weakly Reporter"" representing the diverse individual traits of their directors (Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones respectively). Jones and his story man Mike Maltese made much funnier cartoons after WW2 with ""Punch Trunk"" a great example from their peak era. Freleng's Sloan Foundation trilogy -- ""By Word of Mouse,"" ""Heir Conditioned"" and ""Yankee Dood It"" -- may be dated but definitely belongs here.",1390694400,,1077,5.378698224852071

It was also tough to see the quality slowly drain off, but they did their best with what they had. And my, how attitudes changed. (Norman Normal was...um, judge for yourself.) The extras helped.

I got spoiled with 15 plus Bugs cartoons on each of the first few volumes. I also do not care for the Bosko cartoons as seen on earlier volumes. I still have not watched that disc yet. For the cartoons alone, this set would have only gotten two stars at most from me.

The reason I am glad I bought this set is for the documetary on Mel Blanc. It is excellent! The documentary is almost an hour and ten minutes long. It covers Mel's entire career. I learned many things and enjoyed watching it very much. I am now happy I bought this set as the Mel documentary alone is worth the price of the DVD set.",1346025600,,770,4.238095238095238
3515096,3,B001CO42CA,Most of the cartoons were great but the one's about the war could have been left out of the collections.,1335484800,,104,4.25
3515097,5,B001CO42CA,"Well, at long last, I have purchased Volume Six of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection series! This was the final installment in that particular series...and while there are still many more Looney Tunes cartoons still to be re-discovered, the bulk of the studio's animated classics had already become available via this Golden Collection series and so with Volume Six the remainder of the classics made their way onto this collection.

Much of the cartoons on Disc 1 and Disc 4 were part of a Spotlight Collection I had previously bought and so I didn't watch the cartoons on those two disc's. I mainly focused on Disc 2, the early black and whites on Disc 3, and the documentary on Disc 4 about Mel Blanc titled Mel Blanc: The Man of a Thousand Voices.

On Disc 1 and Disc 3 you'll see cartoons with a lot of different voice actors. Daws Butler's voice appears in several cartoons on Disc 4. His voice can also be heard briefly on the short, ""Heir-Conditioned"", on Disc 2 as some of the alley cats who are after Sylvester's inheritance. Butler is also heard more prominently in ""Yankee Dood It"", on Disc 2, as the shoemaker and the King Elf's apprentice who can never remember the name 'Rumpelstiltskin' and often utters the phrase 'Jehoshaphat'. King Elf is actually Elmer Fudd in traditional Elf costume sporting a big gold crown on his head. Sylvester is part of this cartoon but doesn't have many lines.

The documentary on Mel Blanc is exceptional, in my opinion, as it showcases Mel's career from it's beginnings in the 1920's on local radio in the upper West Coast until his sudden death in 1989. In the span of one year, 1988-1989, the animation world lost several legends: Daws Butler, Mel Blanc, George O'Hanlon, and Jim Backus.

In short, Mel Blanc was a true superstar of radio, records, television, and cartoons. Yes...Mel made a lot of records in the '40s and '50s...a lot of those records were aimed at children (some singles had an older target audience, too). Most people don't know that Mel created the Woody Woodpecker laugh...and was the original voice of Woody at the very beginning. Those offering their thoughts on Mel in this documentary are a varied group.

Disc 2 is comprised mostly of the World War Two cartoons from the early to mid '40s. The last three cartoons on Disc 2 are about the rewards of capitalism and how it's the ideal economic system of free nations: ""By Word of Mouse"", ""Heir-Conditioned"", and ""Yankee Dood It"".

The war cartoons in their unedited form have been a much sought after item of Looney Tunes fans for decades and it took until this final Golden Collection installment to have a disc devoted entirely to those particular cartoons. I saw a comment on-line about how a consumer was dismayed about the all-military art work on the DVD and how it made the person think the entire collection was only military cartoons. The consumer must've bought the DVD based upon cover art and didn't really notice the product page here that describes what all is on the collection.

Now...about that second disc...first and foremost I find nothing wrong with these war cartoons. I am of the belief that the private citizens of Germany and Japan were not being mocked or ridiculed in those cartoons...instead it was the Government of those countries and their military being ridiculed. Once a person enlists in the military he or she is no longer a private citizen and anything's fair game (however 'unfair' that may come across to some).

Before going any further a history lesson is in order for those my age and younger who perhaps aren't as familiar with the mid 40's era of animation and the impact the war had on everyone in all forms of entertainment.

Today's audience see what I call fractured political and military messages strewn through prime-time dramas and comedies on a regular basis...but back in the '40s there was one singular message that flowed through these war cartoons and that message was crystal clear: Support the War Effort.

During WWII America's enemies were primarily Germany and Japan...and the military of those two countries saw a heavy dose of ridicule from cartoon houses all over America. All the animation studios were doing war cartoons on a frequent basis but the Warner cartoons were the most daring, I think, of all the animation studios. Why do I say that? Well, it's because of the style in which the Warner cartoons prided themselves as being. The same irreverence and slapstick overtones of the non-military cartoons carried over to the war cartoons...using the same established characters doing things that the military personnel and those on the home front would LOVE to have done to any number of dictators and tyrants of the world. In that regard the war cartoons provided a much needed psychological comfort.

Some have complained about the ethnic stereotypes in those cartoons but I have no sympathy toward the dictators, tyrants, and enemy combatants who get ridiculed and mocked (stereotypically or otherwise) in these war cartoons.

The WWII cartoons are sought after so much, as I mentioned, that it appears the company deliberately used the military decor to put all the attention on those WWII cartoons. The individual disc's feature a character in a saluting position with an American flag backdrop. Each disc's number is penciled onto an illustrated dog tag, too!

What are the extra's and bonus features you may be asking!?! On Disc 4, as mentioned earlier, there's the Mel Blanc documentary. There are four ""bonus cartoons"" on Disc 4. On Disc 2 there are three bonus cartoons of a military overtone to go along with the WWII cartoons on that disc. Also, there's the inclusion of The Captain and the Kids cartoons that Friz Freleng did for MGM during his short hiatus from Warner Brothers.

On the black and white Disc 3 there's a special called The World of Leon Schlesinger while there are 4 bonus cartoons. In actuality there are 4 bonus cartoons on each disc, making that 19 cartoons altogether on each of the 4 discs.

There are 2 Looney Tunes television specials as special features on Disc One: ""A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court"" and ""Daffy Duck's Easter Special"".

The first special, from 1978, is listed on the DVD by it's VHS title of ""Bugs Bunny in King Arthur's Court"". The made-for-TV cartoon is entertaining and doesn't feature any clips of vintage cartoons which was often the case whenever the Looney Tunes appeared in TV specials. However, there ARE scenes in the King Arthur special which re-use dialogue from other Bugs Bunny cartoons and the die-hard fans will spot right away. Also something that will be detected right away is that Mel Blanc provides the voice of Elmer Fudd, as he had done off and on since original voice actor, Arthur Q. Bryan, had passed away. Mel's natural voice was quite distinctive and it shines through in his performance as Elmer.

The second special, from 1980, is also listed by it's VHS title, ""Daffy Duck's Easter Egg-Citement"". In this special there are three newly created stories woven together: ""The Yolk's On You"", ""The Chocolate Chase"", and ""Daffy Flies North"". The characters featured are Daffy, Speedy Gonzales, Sylvester, Miss Prissy, Foghorn Leghorn. In subsequent decades the three cartoon shorts have been shown separately on various Looney Tunes programs.

All in all it's an outstanding collection...which are what the Golden Collection releases have always been.",1334448000,5,7438,4.88968253968254
3515098,4,B001CO42CA,"Howdy, I recently picked up the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 6.  I wasn't looking forward to it mostly because it appeared to feature mostly older cartoons...which I am not a fan of.  When I got the set though, I was pleasantly surprised by disc 1.  It was a good collection of cartoons from about 1950 which was of course the best year WB was making cartoons.  Also disc 4 was a blessing.  I am so happy that I now own Horton Hatches the Egg.  I'd never seen it before.  It immediately became one of my favorite cartoons.

All things considered, I'm happy I bought it and I recommend it to anyone.  Any chance you guys could publish a volume 7?  I'll be the first in line to buy it.",1330300800,,690,4.2384615384615385

I am FURIOUS. $55 on this set, and the one cartoon I really wanted to see and show others has yakking over it that cannot be turned off. THis should be known to future purchases. There is commentary on several of the features and shorts THAT CANNOT BE TURNED OFF!!!! That is ludicrous -- BEYOND ""looney""...

Absolutely fuming here... KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING!  Someone's boring commentary of a brilliant set of cartoons.  Shame on you, Warner Brothers!",1294358400,10,773,4.825757575757576
3515126,2,B001CO42CA,"I have for a long time been a fan of Looney Tunes and currently own all of the ""Gold Collections."" Overall the previous ones have been pretty good but I am not a fan of the older cartoon characters like ""Beans"" for example. Almost every collection has a number of the older Looney Tunes cartoons and most have one of the four disks dedicated to the older ones.

Okay, fine, I get it. There are some that had to be dug up for history's sake and shown as examples of the earlier works. But this collection is almost exclusively the moldy oldies. I am myself a student of World War 2 history and enough so that I wrote a fiction novel about it but this collection is well beyond enough for me and far into the regions of too much.

Looney Tunes prospered greatly after Leon Schlesinger sold to Warner Brothers. Everything before that sale, while new and revolutionary at the time and significant to the laying of the foundations which made Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny household family classic names, and the best cartoons in history, relative to everything since then, up to the closing of the cartoon division in 1963, is quite frankly crap. So instead of using the plethora of very good shorts previously unexplored in the other Gold Collections, they decided to fill the entire collection with this old garbage most of which is outright painful to watch and still reeks of the days when people were still saying ""Hey look! I can make a drawing move! And even put sound to it!""

If you want Looney Tunes buy one of the other Gold Collections. They are all pretty good. If you want to dive deeply into the early days of cartoon making for history's sake alone and don't mind that most of this collection is just not funny at all, buy this one.",1293926400,7,1739,4.462264150943396
3515127,3,B001CO42CA,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.

Love these collections.  The only thing that would make them better is to make them all the main looney tunes characters and eliminate all the other warner brother cartoons.  Unfortunately, this one had an inordinate amount of those and was the weakest of the collections.  I don't think I recall seeing the brainwashing one yet with ""Elmer Fudd, millionaire, I own a mansion and a yacht"" so there still must be more but I wish they wouldn't just add so much ""fillers"" that I consider rather useless.",1287619200,4,577,4.683168316831683

However, the past few years Warner Brothers Studios has released the amazing Golden Collections.  Beside the many, many great cartoons released over the years, these Golden Collections have always arranged the cartoons being released into appropriate categories. The works of individual Directors (Friz Freleng, Tex Avery, Chuck Jones, Frank Tashlin, etc) or individual characters (Bugs, Daffy, Elmer and the rest), or historical eras (Early Black-and-White, World War II, etc) and many others.  This Collection, the 6th, is every bit as good as the others.  It has the great Daffy and Porky 'My Favorite Duck' and other favorites, recalled by even a single sentence: 'Where's the Gravy?' or 'No, Not the Post!' come instantly to mind.

There is a form of coarseness that runs through some of the older work, the ones that I never remember being broadcast on Saturday morning.  For most of us, this is probably the only way you'll ever see them, and they're interesting.  Some of the war era shorts are downright strange - by modern standards.

The film transfers to video, especially for the older works, is atrocious.  There was so much dirt on the film that it is a significant distraction.  Cleaning film prior to transfer should be standard procedure, unless the major production concern is being cheap.  The later works from after WWII and into the 50's look better.

It is very unfortunate that the series is ending since there is a lot of additional material that could be added to the series.  The originality and depth of these cartoons cannot be matched by today's standards of animation.  The freedom of expression was unlimited and the humor was not age specific.  Gone is the golden age of the real cartoon, never again to grace the silver screen (or tv) in the current polarized arena of political correctness.

The selection is quite varied, including both quite early b/w ones as well as quite a few of the rare WWII vintage, very typical in their propaganda style and therefore often excluded from other collections, as they're today hardly to be considered politically correct.

3515147,4,B001CO42CA,"I have read all of the reviews for this product after viewing this collection.  I do have all six collections now, and I am forced to agree with many of the reviewers who stated that Warner Brothers have only themselves to blame if these collections are not selling well enough to continue the series.  I am obliged to believe that whoever is in charge of designing or arranging these collections either never watched them growing up or really has no idea and cares less about what the majority of fans want to see in these collections.  Disc 1 is a catch all of most of the major characters, although again I am forced to agree with many who point out that Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam have been poorly represented in this series.  Disc 2 is a collection of WWII propaganda cartoons that haven't been featured in previous collections, and frankly it is hit amd miss on this disc.  Disc 3 is the biggest waste of space I have seen yet in any of these collections - all Bosko, Buddy, or Beans, none of which are Looney Tunes characters in the strict sense, and even the bonus cartoons  are a loss.  I am hardly a prude in any sense, but I found the World of Leon Schlesinger section (to put it plainly) vulgar in the extreme.  Disc 4 is outstanding with many of the most requested miscellaneous shorts featured on this disc.  Each disc features either three or four bonus cartoons with those on discs 1 and 4 being the best and some of those on disc 2.  I did enjoy the featurette on Mel Blanc on Disc 4.  Even allowing for the fact that by this time all the cherries have probably been picked, this collection would have been improved by putting more of what the fans want in it instead of putting out what WB evidently wanted to put out.  More people will buy your product if you give them what they want, as opposed to what you want to sell.  I think Looney Tunes are part of many people's pasts that they wish to retain and remember, and I think not only WB but all those who release classic TV programs and movies on DVD would do well to remember that.  This collection is a good collection for those who want to have some of their favorite cartoons in their library, but it is not the best one by a long shot.",1262044800,12,2218,4.313253012048193

3515150,4,B001CO42CA,"The sixth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection is a bit disappointing. While the cartoons that mock Hitler and are about World War II are pretty fantastic in their own right (like ""The Ducktators"" and ""Daffy - The Commando""), there's a whole disc devoted to Bosko and Buddy cartoons. On one hand, it's amazing to have these classic gems on DVD, but on the other, the cartoons themselves aren't all that great. They were made during a time when seeing anything animated was an achievement in itself and these animated shorts prove that theory by not having much of a storyline and just kind of end without any sort of actual ending.

The extras are reason alone for the Looney Tunes lover to purchase this set. Some of the extra shorts are better than what was actually featured on each disc (""Chow Hound"" by Chuck Jones is one of my favorite cartoons ever). Special features range from bonus shorts to television specials to documentaries highlighting producer Leon Schlesinger and voice actor Mel Blanc.

Volume six may not be the best Looney Tunes set to be released thus far, but it's still worth a watch. You just may want to rent it before blind buying it.",1261008000,3,1169,4.669902912621359

My biggest complaint with this set is that many of the cartoons have commentary over them, some guy talking all the way through! I have been unable to find any way to shut it off. How annoying! Just be aware that not all these cartoons will be as enjoyable to watch as past ones. It is really annoying that they couldn't have made it optional to hear the yakking.",1259280000,4,587,4.385321100917431

Some of these shorts may not be interesting to some people, including children.  Most of these cartoons are World War 2 propaganda, which were shown at movie theaters at the time, encouraging people to buy victory bonds for defense.  There is also some violence.
  I recommend the Spotlight Collection Vol. 6 for those who want more of the cartoons that were shown on television. If you are not a collector of vintage cartoons of an era, than this collection is not for you.

Very few of these toons were shown with any real consistency, so this may not be the best choice for a fan looking to walk down memory lane.

3515175,4,B001CO42CA,"This final Golden Collection has some great classic Looney Tunes that I have been waiting for. The most anticipated for me was 'Satan's Waitin'' in which Sylvester goes to Hell numerous times as he uses up his nine lives, egged on by the bulldog Devil. This was taken out of the Saturday morning rotation many years ago. We also get the first Yosemite Sam cartoon 'Hare Trigger'.  Other standouts are 'Often an Orphan' with Charlie Dog and Porky (""I'm 50 percent pointer. There it is, there it is, there it is"") the all time classic 'Chow Hound' (""Don't forget the gravy!"") as well as the 1942 collaboration with Dr Seuss 'Horton Hatches the Egg'. The extras and packaging, as usual, are also fantastic

Unfortunately this collection also suffers from the same problem (although to an even greater extent) as the previous two collections in that far too many cartoons from the 1930's are included. These are pretty much only interesting from a historical perspective since this was definitely NOT the golden age of WB/Schlesinger cartoons.

If the collections had primarily stuck to the 1940-1960 timespan then all of these sets would be beyond reproach. Four or five Buddy/Bosko/Foxy cartoons from the early 30s would be more than enough but we get more than 15 of them here. There are also a few pretty unfunny selections on the WWII themed disc.  The producers of this package evidently chose to feature so many of these because they need to burn off the mediocre cartoons in their backlist while still leaving enough of the best of the classic era of Looney Tunes (app 1941-1963) available for future sets.  Out of the 4 discs there are about 2 1/2 discs of worthy cartoons.  Not  really worth the original 69.99 price tag.

Having said all of that, now that the price has dropped below $30 you should snap this up immediately!  Just skip most of the 'toons on disc 3 and some on disc 2 and you'll be more than satisfied.",1257379200,5,1925,4.705357142857143

Bugs, Daffy and their pals repeatedly thumb their nose in ""der fuhrer's face"" and rekindle the spirit of what it was like to live during the war years. Also notable in this collection are the many one-shots that are fondly remembered, but rarely seen. Usually descriptions of these cartoons include, ""Remember the one with..."" and can often be recalled by a simple catch phrase: ""No, not that! Not the birdbath!""...

Looney Tunes remain the very best in cartoons. You will never match that era and imagination. Computers can allow special effects, but these remain a true feeling of the time and written with excellence.

Pan and scan:
My only beef is they use that stupid center cut technology so part of the cartoon has been cut off. If you restore something, make it so we can see ALL the picture, not just the middle section. You take the time to do it in the opening credits, and tnt or cartoon network did that one year during a June Bugs marathon. Good for them.

3515182,3,B001CO42CA,"Either by luck or by listening to fans, Warner finally got something right with this latest collection. In the previous sets, each contained a disc with cartoons featuring a particular Looney Tunes character. This was okay if you were in the mood to see a bunch of great Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck cartoons, but most people--I believe--prefer seeing a mix of cartoons, rather than watching cartoon after cartoon of the same character, more or less stuck in the same formula. (Really, did anyone out there have a desire to see 12 Tweety and Sylvester teamups or 12 Speedy Gonzales cartoons in a row?)

With the final collection, Warner has two good discs--the first and the last--with mostly great cartoons covering multiple characters.  Maybe if they'd gone that route from the get-go they wouldn't be forced to discontinue the series due to diminishing sales.

As for the excellent Mel Blanc documentary--what took so long? Blanc was probably the single-most important player in success of Looney Tunes, and he has to wait until volume 6 to get recognized?",1244419200,3,1055,4.9491525423728815

My only complaint, and it's a minor one: I was never a big fan of the Buddy or Bosko shorts, and I feel like Warners really didn;t come into their own until later in the 30s with the introduction of Daffy and Porky, and ultimately Bugs Bunny. There are lots of these Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts that I'm still waiting for on DVD and I just hope that Warners will release them in a similar 4-disc format. The six collections they've released to date have been great; some long-awaited cartoons seeing the light of day...and I know, I've said on these posts before, they couldn't possibly put ALL the best cartoons out in one set, they made far too many for that. I only hope they'll keep 'em coming. I'll buy 'em for sure! I'd like to see another collection with more of the Road Runner too (my two cents there).

3515185,4,B001CO42CA,"I have to admit, few of these `toons bring my childhood favorites back to life. To make up for that lack, this collection includes material that I don't recall seeing before, and that I found very informative.

The big surprise was ""Horton Hatches the Egg,"" a Dr. Seuss story in animation. If you don't like Dr. Seuss - well, I guess I don't know why you're watching cartoons at all, then. Collaboration with the good doctor made that an instant classic. Pieces from the WWII era stand out, too. That was the last war with such high civilian support and involvement. As a result, it's no surprise that the animation industry supported the effort, bringing its own brand of ridicule to the patriotic (or propagandistic) effort. I'm not a WWII historian, so one feature did surprise me. Russian leaders, when Russia and the US fought a common foe, got much more favorable press than they did once the cold war started, a few years later. A few zealous paeans to capitalism also took my by surprise - I'll have to check the dates, but they might have come from the early days of the communist menace, as indoctrination into the Us side of Us vs. Them.

As always in these Golden Collections, the extras are worth watching. Each disk offers a few short cartoons in the extras, in addition to the main program. Perhaps they had been in the main program until some marketer decided the extras section needed padding; perhaps they really represent a lower but still worthwhile standard of entertainment. Interviews and commentaries round out these discussions - not for everyone, perhaps, but certainly a treat for some viewers. I can't say this is my favorite among the Golden Collection series, but it still belongs in any `toon-loving household.

Of course the Looney Tunes deserve every bit of love and legendary status they've recieved over generations, but nearly half of Vol. 6 in this series is given over to material that is mainly of interest to collectors and historians, and the overall entertainment value is somewhat diminished.
  Problem no. 1 is disc 3 of the set, devoted entirely to the Buddy and Bosco cartoons made before the classic period. The studio had not found its own voice yet, and for the most part these shorts are obvious rips of early Walt Disney. Film buffs will want these in their collection, but there is none of the personality or biting wit that Warner toons would later be known for.
  Problem no. 2 : Disc 2 consists of 12 wartime propoganda toons, and 3 educational shorts apparently meant for students of economics. That's right, folks - one week before the historic Wall Street meltdown, Warners releases its films of world-class moron Elmer Fudd teaching the wonders of our financial investment system to a stubborn old man, a bunch of elves, and a slobbering cat. Isn't irony wonderful?
  O.K., that's the beef- now for the good stuff. Disc one is another non-stop roaring fun-fest with all the your favorite characters from the golden age represented. But the real treat here is the incredible selection of one-shot, oddball masterpieces on disc 4. These rarities, requested by fans, represent Warner animation at its absolute peak of creativity. One of the most noteworthy is ""Now Hear This"", a wordless gem of playful surrealism. But the most startling short of all is saved for last. ""Norman Normal"" is such a stunning contast to the conservative, never-question-authority tone of the WWII shorts, it's hard to believe it was made by the same studio. Norman, a decent, eager office worker, is conflicted by the greed, dishonesty and corruption of his boss, and dismayed by the narrow-minded superficiality of his peers. And in a total reversal from the racial stereotypes Warners is constantly apologizing for, Norman walks out of a party after being repulsed by an obvious ethnic joke!! Clearly, the studio had embraced the attitude changes of the time. While it was believed that Warner toons were in decline in the 60's, this slice of social commentary shows that the studio was willing  to take creative risks right up to the end, and finishes the Golden series on a high note.
  And that's the story. For me and other fanatics, the best parts of this set are indispensible. But if you're a casual fan, it's your call if a half-looney set is worth your $60.",1232323200,6,2615,4.819196428571429

I am not one to expect that every cartoon will be a favorite, but I'll have to say this volume is rather full of filler.

Hitler and the Gremlins from D Kremlin is a must see! It is unfortunate that this is it for us as we all know they could continue to produce these sets. There are other sets with more bugs, daffy, and roadrunner not to mention Sam & Ralph but all 6 volumes are worth owning!",1227398400,2,548,3.9909090909090907
3515205,3,B001CO42CA,"For those who have already purchased the Golden Collection vol. 1-5, you'll obviously want to pick this set up.  There are enough gems on here to make it worth buying to complete your collection.  Some of the most notable shorts were as follows:

""Crowing Pains"" - my favorite Foghorn Leghorn cartoon, co-starring Barnyard Dawg, Sylvester, and Henery Hawk
""Satan's Waitin'"" - Sylvester's nine lives get picked off one-by-one.
""Bear Feat"" - another great Three Bears short
""Dog Gone South"" - Charlie Dog tries to replace a southerner's bulldog... ""Oh Belvedere!  Come here, boy!""
""Herr Meets Hare"" - features an operatic moment later reused in ""What's Opera, Doc?""
""A Cartoonist's Nightmare"" - a now-common gag of an animator interacting with his drawings. (update: I incorrectly had called this a Bosko cartoon, when in fact it's Beans the Cat.)
and several great ""one-shots"" on disc 4.

Besides these shorts, the hour-long documentary on Mel Blanc was a treat.  This new production features interviews with Mel's son Noel, current voice artists and animators, and several others in the industry.

For those who were primarily fans of ""The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show"" on ABC or ""The Looney Tunes Show"" on Cartoon Network, this set may not be for you.  There are a lot of obscure cartoons here that you most likely will not enjoy.  I can appreciate the historical significance of the war-related shorts and the early B&W shorts, but I still think that their entertainment value has sharply diminished.  In other words, they haven't quite held up to the test of time.  If you're not a collector, but see some shorts you'd like to own from disc 1 or disc 4 of this set, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Spotlight-Collection-Vol-6/dp/B001CO42CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection, Vol. 6</a>.

Hopefully, now that the Golden Collection has been discontinued and a good portion of the cartoons from the '30s have been released, we'll soon see a new line of DVDs featuring more of the crowd-pleasing favorites.  Personally, I'd love to see each director get his own boxset!",1226707200,8,2167,5.338235294117647
3515206,3,B001CO42CA,"Like most of you reading this, I am a big fan of the Looney Tunes.  But I have to say in all honestly that of all the Golden Collections series, Volume Six is probably the weakest boxed set.  Yes, there are some treasures here but for the most part this volume is hit and miss.

Disc 1:  There are some great shorts on this disc including ""Jumpin' Jupiter"", ""Hare Trigger"", and ""Bear Feat"" (can't get enough of those bears) but there is still an awful lot of filler.

Disc 2:  This is the grand prize of the collection.  Warner Bros. has finally released the World War II propaganda shorts which are indeed a treat.  Sadly even though each disc starts with a disclaimer about how the cartoons are a product of their time the studio chose not to release ""Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips"".  Yes it is offensive but no more so than some of the other stereotypes against various ethnic groups that are found on this set.

Disc 3:  This is mostly old Bosko cartoons. They are kind of cute but I can't imagine myself watching them more than once.

Disc 4: I was hoping this would mirror the ""Assorted Nuts"" disc released by Warner's back in the nineties.  I am glad Chow Hound and Wild Wife finally made it to DVD but I missed out on other nuts such as ""Strife With Father"" and ""A to Z-z-z-z"".  ""Feline Frame-Up"".  Hopefully those shorts will be released somewhere down the road.  Still, recommended for Looney Tune fans.",1226275200,8,1408,4.42023346303502
3515207,5,B001CO42CA,"If you have been following this series, don't stop now. Sure there is none of the top 10 classics as they've already been out but this is still great stuff.
Disc 1 has heaps of memorable cartoons from the top shelf of LT My favorite is Bear Feat followed by Jumpin Jupiter a great Porky, Sylvester team up.
Disc 2 Patriotic Pals contains wartime cartoons which were not aired much on t.v. I found them really enjoyable and a couple excellent.
Disc 3 contains early era MM's and LT's all B & W I found them really well restored but more interesting than entertaining.
Disc 4 contains one-offs which for the most part are great I love The Hole Idea, Chow Hound and Much Ado About Nutting..
The extra cartoons are also great. I love the Ralph Phillips one as well as the Christmas Captain and the Kids and Hippety Hopper.
The place to start these collections is the first few sets but this is another great addition.",1226275200,2,913,4.440476190476191
3515208,5,B001CO42CA,"I give this one 5.  I think its a good close to the Golden Collection, a treasure, though flawed.  Some of the discs along the way have stunk, and I much prefer the ""All Star"" disc format to the Tweety disc or the Road Runner disc or the other theme discs.  I think a better system would have been a Bugs Disc, A Porky and Daffy disc, an All Star's Disc, and a disc of either early cartoons or a theme disc for each set.  That might have made people happier.  But the cartoons are out there and this set is strong.  It remedies a problem with the set up until volume 6 which is WB insisted on including lots of early cartoons but never gave us Sniffles the Mouse or Bosko.  Now we get a Sniffles, and plenty of Bosko.  They also include the Fritz Freleng MGM shorts with the Captain which are as good as early Looney Tunes, so there are really about 80 shorts here.  This set includes less Bugs and a lot of cartoons I never remembered loving until I saw them (what a healthy green baby...green...aahhhhh!!!!), as well as some you'll have never seen, which is nice.  I just hope they put out more sets with some of the favorites I am missing.  There are a few duds on this set, but all the discs are good and there is a ton of variety.  It rounds out the other discs well.",1226102400,,1272,4.126016260162602
3515209,4,B001CO42CA,"Let's face it--""Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 6"" isn't going to please everyone. If you're looking for an exceptional collection of ""classics"" that you grew up on watching TV, go for the ""Spotlight Collection, Volume 6"" as it features the highlights of this set plus two handfuls of rare cartoons that haven't been seen in some time. For many fans, though, this set is just about perfect. It includes rare vintage World War II cartoons that featured Bugs and other Warner staples face-to-face with Hitler and others as well as a great collection of classic cartoons.

Here's a break down and brief synposis of most of the cartoons on each disc:
To Duck...or Not to Duck- A Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd cartoon by Tedd Pierce and Chuck Jones. Daffy is in his goofy incarnation and the relationship here hints at the one that Jones would develop between Bugs and Elmer later.

Birth of a Notion - One of the rare war time efforts included here from Volume 6--a great one I might add) belongs to the Blue Ribbon group of reissued cartoons which means there are no credits for who wrote and directed it but it clear is a Bob Clampett effort that follows Daffy Duck as he tries to get a home for the winter by ""appearing"" to save a dog from being poisoned.

My Little Duckaroo (Daffy again)

Crowing Pains -Foghorn Leghorn in his first cartoon

Raw! Raw! Rooster -Another Foghorn cartoon with McKimson at his best. Heaven Scent -Peppy Le Pew one Jones few characters that I never really appreciated.

My Favorite Duck-One of the first pairings of Jones and Maltese also puts together Porky Pig and Daffy Duck as the latter tries to prevent Porky from camping out. Porky wears what looks like a baby nipple on his head. It's a chuckle.

Jumpin' Jupiter -Sylvester and Porky abducted by aliens.

Satan'a Waitin' -A hilarious cartoon where Sylvester's need to get Tweety puts him in...Hell.

Hook, Line and Stinker -A Chuck Jones Roadrunner cartoon...not his best but has its moments

Bear Feat

Dog Gone South-Once again features Charlie the dog that no one wants because he is obnoxious this time matching wits with a southern plantation owner.

A Ham in a Role Those Goofy Gofers show up in another McKimson cartoon.

Often an Orphan Charlie the Dog...you know the annoying one that keeps trying to be adopted by...someone...anyone! A Jones/Maltese production it's clever.

The second disc focuses on the patriotic/World War II cartoons that often were seen only once in theaters unless a revival house showed them or they were shown in a class on animation. These include:

Herr Meets Hare( A funny Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs treats Herman Goring like he's Elmer Fudd and impersonates Hitler and Stalin!) Russian Rhapsody (Originally entitled ""Gremlins"" by Bob Clampett--another funny one with impeccable draftsmanship by McKimson. Hitler decides to bomb Russia himself but is foiled by Russian Gremlins!

Daffy-The Commando (Self explanatory)

Bosko The Doughboy (A rare short featuring the character that was popular in the 1930's)

Rookie Revue -is another war time short from Freleng giving us an imagery day in the army

The Draft Horse (As Greg Ford points out in his excellent commentary this one was a turning point for Chuck Jones who had primarily been known for his cute Disney character pieces. Chuck stepped into Wackyland here) The Weakly Reporter ("" a Jones/Maltese collaboration as with many of these one-off's is related to the World War II. It's a humorous look at how the average person has been affected by the war. It's got a number of clever gags.

Fifth Column Mouse

Meet John Doughboy

Hollywood Canine Canteen

By Word of Mouse Friz Freleng's ode to capitalism with Hans the Mouse. Heir-Conditioned -Bugs again

Yankee Dood T -Features Elmer as King of the Elves who wants the Shoemaker to give all of the Elves up. It's another primer in capitalism. Sylvester also appears and takes great interest in the Elves hoping that through the use of a magic word to turn them all into mice.

Disc Three takes on Bosko (an early Warner character who lost favor by the time that Bugs, Daffy and the other characters were in development) and other early Merrie Melodies stars and this disc includes:

Congo Jazz Smile, Darn Ya, Smile The Booze Hangs High One More Time Bosko's Picture Show You Don't Know What You're Doin'! We're in the Money Ride Him, Bosko Shuffle Off to Buffalo Bosko in Person The Dish Ran Away with the Spoon Buddy's Day Out Buddy's Beer Garden Buddy's Circus A Cartoonist's Nightmare dates from 1935 and is an early black and white Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Jack King

Disc four features a variety of classic cartoons under the ""Assorted Nuts"" title some of which had characters that only appeared a couple of times and some where they only appeared one time.

Horton Hatches the Egg -A Chuck Jones collaboration with Ted Giesel aka Dr. Seuss

Lights Fantastic -A Broadway musical cartoon focusing on the ""life"" of signs by Freleng

Fresh Airedale -Again, featuring Charlie the Dog, this is one of the Blue Ribbon cartoons. These reissues often left off the credits as to who created the cartoon. This one looks like one of Art Davis' efforts but without a commentary track and without looking it up I can't say for certain)

Chow Hound

The Oily American

It's Hummer Time is a Warren Foster-Robert McKimson collaboration. McKimson one of the finest draftsmen and animators often was slighted for the cartoons he directed simply because they didn't have the quirky personality of Jones' work or the slapstick insanity of Freleng's. This is a terrific effort from McKimson with wonderfully rich characterizations

Rocket-Bye Baby -Another Michael Maltese-Chuck Jones science fiction classic where babies are delivered to the wrong planet. As with all of the Jones-Maltese collaborations its innovative, funny and shows the unique chemistry of these two who did some of their best work along with designer Maurice Noble

Goo Goo Goliath- A clever cartoon by the perfect team of Warren Foster and Fritz Freleng with expert animation by Art Davis among others that focuses on a drunk stork who delivers the son of the Giant who lives at the top of a bean stock to a normal sized family.

""Wild Wife"" is another McKimson/Foster effort from the 50's focusing on a woman's typical day when her husband scoffs at the fact that she doesn't have enough time to do all the chores.

Much Ado About Nutting-This is a Jones-Maltese collaboration. Jones and his animators were always able to elicit laughs out of the slightest movement of a facial muscle and this one is no exception involving a chipmunk who believes he has hit the motherlode when he stumbles on a peanut vendor...

The Hole Idea -A scientist invents portable holes a decade before ""Yellow Submarine"".

Now Hear This

Martian Through Georgia

Page Miss Glory- is a very early effort with designs that firmly puts it in either the late 30's or early 40's before Warner developed the rambunctious style that would become a hallmark of the studio. ***

Norman Normal- Directed by Alex Lovy, this is a relative rare 60's cartoon. None of the ""regular"" Warner star characters are involved.

Special features include a documentary on Mel Blanc, audio commentaries by Greg Ford, Mark Kausler and historian Jerry Beck. The commentary on ""Fifth Column Mouse"" is missing.

We get ""Daffy Duck's Easter Special"" a cheap prime time special made by DePathie-Freleng the company that Friz founded to do the Pink Panther cartoons. It's co-written by Friz and directed by him. ***

""Bugs Bunny in King Arthur's Court"" is another prime time special this one co-written and directed by Chuck Jones. Aside from Jones' distinctive animation and drawing style, there really isn't much to this tale where Bugs crosses swords with Elmer Fudd who believes he's a dragon and presents him to King Arthur played by the usually clueless Daffy Duck. It's mildly entertaining but the production values are low and the characters just don't gel but it's nice to have them.

We also get a number of extra cartoons including Friz Freleng's ""Captain and the Kids"" black and white cartoons done for MGM as well as Chuck Jones' counterpart to ""Duck Amuck"" featuring Bugs Bunny which is often criticized as not being as funny as ""Duck Amuck"". Perhaps it isn't but seeing Bugs change in a variety of ""other"" creatures is a chuckle.

There is also a collection of Bosko and Buddy cartoons included as well as Private Snafu and other cartoons that were done in B&W some specifically only for the troops to see.

Overall, this is an outstanding collection that looks quite good. It's marred only by the inclusion of some less than classic cartoons that were included for completists or because they fit with the theme of this set (which probably would have been more appropriate to release around the 4th of July given the cover). Hopefully the next series will focus on the various Warner ""persoanlities"" and eras as opposed to being an occasional hodge-podge mixture of classic, historically important and rare cartoons.",1225756800,20,9081,4.893020221787345
3515210,5,B001CO42CA,"This is simply the best one yet.  Makes up for all the Road Runner and Speedy Gonzales stuff they had to put in the other volumes to get Joe Six Pack or Joe The Unlicensed Plumber to buy it.

3515211,5,B001CO42CA,"As Spike, the bulldog in that famous cat-and-mouse series from another studio entirely, once put it, ""'dis is more like it!!""

I have wanted the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION series to look like the contents of these four truly golden disks for as long as the collection existed!  This collection truly has something for everyone--cartoons from the days that were golden to those who were introduced to these characters on many a Saturday morning, and cartoons for those of us (like me) who grew up knowing that there were LOONEY TUNES before Bugs and Daffy and the rest of the characters that most folks (and the clothing makers) are familiar with.  No one, and I mean *NO ONE* should be complaining here.  I think I've played the contents of these disks more than I've played all the contents of the other sets combined, and the pure gold in these sets have also forced me to go back and appreciate all over again the true essence of other volumes in this collection.  My only down side is that I wish it were still going beyond six volumes but, judging from the previous reviews here, it seems as if the collections that indeed are promised for the future may have to further sharpen their focus, perhaps a deeper unearthing of all the decades of this studio's prominence in separate volumes, to each find their nitch audience as so many are sneering here at the diligence of those at Warner Brothers who do really care about the history of the animation studio.  It is all very important and should be seen in volume after volume, and gathering them into one detailed series is getting those who would have never given some titles a toss a chance to again check the stuff out and enjoy the studio in all its incarnations and struggles to get to where it got before the doors were closed in the 1960's.

We finally get the taste that some of us have been longing for of the wartime shorts here, with the inclusion of an ultra-rare WB short called ""THE DUCKTATORS"", now seen here with its ending intact, and even the earliest LOONEY TUNES star, Bosko, suddenly finding his world at war!  On the same disk, as bonus feature, we get a glimpse at what Friz Freleng had done during a time away from the Warner Brothers cartoon studio, working on a failed series for MGM of the KATZENJAMMER KIDS comic strip, here called THE CAPTAIN & THE KIDS, and, despite its unpopularity even with the animators, we see that Freleng ads his own comic touch to some of these shorts, like the beer barrel sequence in ""A DAY AT THE BEACH"" and the hilarious results of the horse in ""MAMA'S NEW HAT"" accidentally tipping over a bottle of glue and getting an electric fan stuck on its rump--makes me long for a similar unearthing and restoration on these and other more notable MGM titles to show the touches given to that studio by the likes of Mel Blanc who voiced the goofy raven in the two BOOK WORM cartoons produced by Hugh Harmon.

The third disk is daring in its exposure of some shorts that show our perspective on the world during the 1930's.  It is a unique time capsule as the studio begins to formulate and the animators find their way.  Now, we finally get to see the uncut version of ""BUDDY'S CIRCUS"", a cartoon often severely edited on Nickelodeon showings, and then there is the simple but surreal ""CARTOONIST'S NIGHTMARE"", a premise perhaps somewhat better executed at a studio like Max Fleischer's during that same period and before, but it is still a unique touch.  It is also notable that we finally get the complete ""blooper reel"" or gag reel that those at Termite Terrace produced to amuse themselves at the Warner Brothers Christmas party.

The set closes on a high note, too, with an ASSORTED NUTS collection of one shots that prove the studio's diversity over the years, displaying that, even within the often-disliked final period of ""limited animation"", the last theatrical age of LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES, the mid-1960's, there was still a hint of something novel and creative.  In fact, I liked the way the set closes, with an inventive cartoon from its early period (""PAGE MISS GLORY"") and its final days (""NORMAN NORMAL""), the latter featuring the vocal talents of Peter, Paul & Mary with the comedy ""stylings"" and vocal clowning of Paul Stookey, telling the story of one man and his dissatisfaction with the corporate world which should be played over and over again during our current economic trials!  It is not only a time capsule, but a film that still unfortunately remains relevant!

This set is an absolute triumph, and I want Warner Brothers to know that I've never seen such an intelligent, clear-headed collection from any studio to rival this.  If this is the end of the series, I only hope that the years hence bring us gems that dig even deeper into the vaults before the ravages of time do a healthy job of stealing more of our memories!  Wonderful job, guys and gals.  This should win all kinds of awards for its excellence!  It should and will not be the last ""hoorah"" for all LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES as this is just the tip of the iceberg!  The true thaw has begun!",1225065600,9,5111,4.613009922822492
3515212,1,B001CO42CA,"If you are perhaps a cartoon historian you might appreciate this collection, however, this set of cartoons is not entertaining.  There are a lot of cartoons that are just not funny.  So if you are a casual cartoon fan, I would stay away from it.",1224979200,12,245,4.4222222222222225
3515213,4,B001CO42CA,"The sixth Looney Tunes Golden Collection is here!  Sound the welcomes and blow the crumpets!

This is a nice addition to the Golden Collection series, yet there are a few aspects that prevent this set from reaching the lofty heights of a few of the previous volumes.

Disc One has a great mix of cartoons, ranging from Yosemite Sam's debut to a couple of Foghorn Leghorn classics.  (One frustrating thing about the Golden Collection is how few Foggy cartoons were included - considering that Speedy Gonzales got an entire disc..!)

Disc Two features a lot of rare WW2 cartoons, as well as the three WB cartoons of the 50's that speak of the vitures of capitalism.

Disc Three probably won't appeal to the average fan, but the early B&W cartoons are fun to watch on a rainy afternoon (for me, anyway!).

Disc Four is pure gold!  Many rare, one-shot cartoons that fans have wanted to get for years.  These one-shot cartoons are films the directors *wanted* to make.  They often feature experimental storylines and artwork.  They are also often better than the films that featured WB's usual cast of characters.

The bonus features on this collection are quite sparse, yet we *do* get one of the best bonus items in the whole Golden Collection series - the infamous Schlesinger Christmas reels!

The Christmas reels are short comedy programs made by the studio to be shown before the employees all went out to the annual Christmas party.  It's a treat to be able to see all of the people who worked at the studio all those years ago.

There is also an optional commentary by Martha Sigall and Jerry Beck.  Martha identifies just about everyone in the short films.  Her memories offer a wonderful glimpse into life at the studio and finally being able to put faces to the names we've seen all these years is a treat!  (After watching the reels, go watch ""Russian Rhapsody"" and try to see which
gremlin was which Schlesinger employee!)

Sadly, apart from the Christmas reels and the in-depth feature on Mel Blanc, the rest of the bonus features included are lacking.

The ""bonus"" shorts are unrestored, which is painfully obvious.  Warner Brothers has said that future collections won't ""double dip"", yet I hope this doesn't mean these bonus shorts won't be restored.  Including them on this set seems to suggest that they won't be restored in the future.  That would be unfortunate.

The number participants for cartoon commentaries also dropped off.  Only Jerry Beck, Greg Ford, and Mark Kausler took part.  Earlier volumes featured more of a variety of participants, so it seems like this is more bare-bones release than the earlier collections.

The ""lower-shelf"" feeling is also enhanced by some quality-control issues too...  For example, there is a Jerry Beck introduction on disc three for the ""Bugs Bunny Bond Rally"", yet that film is not on the disc.  What's more, the packaging lists a Jerry Beck commentary for ""Fifth Column Mouse"", yet there is no commentary for that cartoon on the disc...

Volume 6 is a welcome addition to the Golden Collection series, but maybe it is time to move on.  The bare-bones ""bonus"" features and lack of commentary participants makes this release seem to be not as special as earlier volumes.  The lack of quality control also makes you wonder if now might be the best time to end this series.  (Maybe we'll eventually see collections that feature characters like Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe Le Pew (ala the ""Golden Jubilee 24 Karat"" VHS collections from the mid-80's.)

But, the (main) episodes look as great as the cartoons do on the earlier sets, which is why we buy these in this first place.  For that fact alone this set is highly recommended!",1224892800,15,3684,4.802861685214626
3515214,4,B001CO42CA,"Warner Bros recently announced that they expect sales of Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 6 to be ""mild,"" and that this release will probably be the last of the series. They did say that they would continue releasing the cartoons under a different title, but I know that merely changing the title of the releases isn't going to improve the sales numbers.

The reason the Golden Collections aren't selling so well is because they refuse to make the DVDs that people want. People want a variety of different characters on each disc, not 15 cartoons in a row all of the same character.

The people who were waiting for Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe Le Pew are going to be really upset that Vol. 6 has a disc of Bosko and Buddy instead. Almost no one cares about those cartoons. Those cartoons should have had their own seperate release instead of being mixed in on Vol. 6 with the cartoons that everyone wants.

Want to make something that sells a huge amount? Release a 10 disc (single sided, double layered) set of 300 cartoons where each disc has a wide variety of characters. That would sell very, very well.

If a 10 disc set would be too expensive for a lot of people, then how about 10 individual releases, with 30 cartoons per disc?

Each disc could have:

3 Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoons

2 Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam

1 Bugs Bunny and minor character

1 Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck

4 Daffy Duck

1 Daffy Duck and Porky Pig

2 Porky Pig

3 Tweety and Sylvester

2 Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote

2 Foghorn Leghorn

1 Speedy Gonzales

1 Pepe Le Pew

1 Marvin the Martian or 1 Tasmanian Devil

1 Marc Antony and Pussyfoot or 1 Hubie and Bertie

1 Wolf and Sheepdog or 1 Goofy Gophers

4 Miscellaneous or one shots or some other cartoon, which could include any of the above characters

Mix the cartoons around so no character appears in two consecutive cartoons.

Each disc could have a suggested price of $19.99 and an actual price of $13.99.

They could be called ""Classic Looney Tunes Vol. 1"" and so on.

Huge numbers of people would buy these.

I love Road Runner cartoons. But who wants to watch 11 of them in a row, as is the current situation on Vol. 2?

Wouldn't it be more fun to watch a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and then a Road Runner cartoon, and then a Tweety and Sylvester cartoon?

3515215,4,B001CO42CA,"Another fabulous collection of shorts.  I'm a fan who LOVES the older and more obscure titles.  Bring on MORE Bosko and Buddy and 1930's black and white.  One thing I especially liked about this set is that the discs were well mixed.  Sure, Bugs is great, (as is Daffy, Speedy and everyone else)  but sitting through 15 Bugs shorts in a row can get a wee bit tiresome.

Downsides?  Disc one of my set is defective, so it has to go back for an exchange. (This is the only time I've had a problem with a LT set, so I'm sure it's a fluke.)  And I might have liked to see more and better extras. I'm guessing that, after 5 sets, they've run out of documentaries and such, but why put 5 more standard titles on the disc and call them 'special features?' Why not more Private Snafu on the military disc? Or some of the more politically incorrect Buddys and Boskos on the 'early days' disc?  Also frustrating was the inability to play the audio commentaries AND the subtitles at the same time.

 Finally, the loss of foreign language tracks and subtitles is a dissappointment.  (Yes, I'm quite fluent in English, but have always enjoyed listening to Daffy speaking French!)

Here's hoping that when they release their next series, they continue to offer new, never-before-released-on-DVD,  shorts. (And not, as someone else fears, 15 re-releases and 5 new titles on each disc.)",1224806400,4,1370,4.607438016528926
3515216,2,B001CO42CA,"There are some great cartoons on here.  A lot of filler, though.  I agree with the previous reviews: Bugs, Daffy, etc. they need to complete the collection, before going into other characters.

The packaging is the usual crappy digipak.  Paper is a stupid medium for packaging DVDs.  It wears out.  The overlapping disc holders scratch the discs.  Disc 4 was scratched when I got it.  Many others have the same problem.

Put them in plastic Amaray box!!!  They actually work.  And they can be made from recycled plastic.  At $45-55/set these are not throwaway items.  Don't sell them as such.  Digipaks are cheap looking.",1224720000,5,621,4.846153846153846
3515217,5,B001CO42CA,"I've just watched several of the vol. 6 shorts and I can conclude, after viewing sets 1 through 5 as well, that this is the best set since volume 3.  People who have not bought or rented (Netflixed) vol. 6 most likely have never seen the majority of these shorts.  It seems there are many negative reviews by people who just want to see the shorts they remember from TV.  The fact is, you can't please every type of LT fan when 60 shorts have to be released at once.  The gems of these collections far outweigh the forgetful, later shorts.  I thought the WWII shorts would be a drag, but Clampett's ""Russian Rhapsody"" has become one of my favorites.  Fans of cartoon history will be sure to find new favorites in this set.",1224720000,7,722,4.350746268656716
3515218,4,B001CO42CA,"Hello,
  I can't understand some of the reviews of this set.  I am one of the people who likes to learn.  I have been watching Looney Tunes my entire life (I am 57), and there is nothing I delight in seeing more than ones I have never seen before.  It is like finding a lost treasure.  Why would I want to see the same ones over and over that I saw when I was a child in the late 50's?  It is fascinating to me to see the origins of these characters and the origins of the artists and directors. After all, this is the sixth set.  As an adult collector, how many Bugs-Bunny-out-wits-Elmer cartoons do we have to see?
  So!! Bring on the ""Bosco""s the propaganda 'toones and the early black and white Porky Pigs.  I have never seen most of these before, and I just might learn something.",1224720000,12,785,4.166666666666667

3515220,2,B001CO42CA,"Its very sad that Corporate greed won out and has resulted in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection being canceled. I could see it coming three sets back. When they started trying to stretch the sets out by adding obscure characters like Bosko that nobody grew up watching of the forty something generation. Incredible misdirection has caused the executives at Warner Brothers to shoot themselves in the foot big time! My generation couldn't care less about characters like that, we wanted to see Bugs bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosmite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Road Runner, Sylvester and Tweety and Elmer Fudd. If Bosko is such a great character then why not give him his own box set? And WHO is buddie? They wouldn't because it wouldn't and DIDN'T sell, so they used it as a cheap filler which cost them. Looking at the last set, Volume six Warner executives still didn't get it. Lots of cheap fillers produce unhappy people which won't buy your product. If Warner had stayed faithful to the proven formula the sets would've resulted in huge revenues for them. Sad. And whats with all the World War two propaganda films in volume six? I am sure these old Black and White films are of some historic value, but they are not really that funny or interesting. These shorts prove that Warner lost site of what people really wanted to see. These sets were supposed to be the cream of the crop of characters we all know and love, in chronological order would've been preferable, with hand picked gems representing each beloved one. Instead we get someone trying to paint an early history of Warner Brothers cartoons, folding in uninspired, forgettable Junk characters. The dream of having the very best of the Looney tune characters we grew up with is dead. With set six we have forgettable characters with old B/W WW2 propaganda films.",1224547200,11,1817,4.789808917197452
3515221,1,B001CO42CA,"It's hard to believe that Warner Bros. was once one of The Great Studios. The Looney Tunes Collection is potentially outstanding -- one could even say of historical note, given the role of cartoons from the 40s through the mid-60s. But with two great releases in Volume 1 and Volume 2, the collection has steadily declined to this sad excuse in Volume 6.

Warner Bros. has taken the same approach that the music industry has taken with CDs -- with the same result, namely a decline in public interest and a public turn to online downloading.

That approach consists in putting one or two great tracks on a disc to attract buyers and ramming garbage down our throats with the remainder.

What made Looney Tunes great was outstanding animators -- Chuck Jones, Bill McKimson, Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, Tex Avery, Ken Harris, Abe Levitow, Ben Washam. Some of their work has become iconographic in American culture, as much as any great movie (like Wizard of Oz or Gone With the Wind). Warner drops any attempt to capture this. Certainly by Volume 4, Warner has established it's plan to ram less interesting material down our throats.

This wouldn't matter IF Warner included more of the gems. But entire characters are almost unrepresented in the series. Most notably to my mind is Claude the Cat -- hilarious and absent but for two cartoons (if I remember correctly). Better known and almost as unrecognized is Pepe le Pew.

Warner destroyed what could have been a consistently great collection just as they destroyed the Batman series.

Again, a triumph of moronic marketing over substance and quality.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE: I have a huge personal collection of these cartoons on tape. Since Warner has effectively abandoned these treasures, practically putting them out with the trash, I will now treat my collection as in the public domain. Look for Looney Tunes online.",1224547200,20,1869,4.8955696202531644
3515222,3,B001CO42CA,"The last few releases sure had a lot of ancient, unfunny, (but, I'm sure historically important) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies animated shorts.

I didn't care for how they put these boxes together anyway.  Our favorite 1940's and 1950's classics mixed in with alot of 1930's ""undesirables"".

What I'd like to see is a big 10 DVD box release of Looney Tunes from the 1940's and 1950's released in chonological order.  I want every cartoon to seem to belong to it's genre without going astray into some dumb 1930's ""less than desirable"" dinosaur cartoon.  They knew back in the late 1970's and the 1980's what cartoons we enjoyed on Saturday mornings (remember ""The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Hour""?)  We don't want to see WWII history, we want Bugs, and Daffy, and all their pals with their ""over-the-top"" comic lunacy.

I hope the ending of this current format means that something better is yet to come to re-introduce our favorite Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies animated shorts in a new formatted box set.  Let's all hope.",1223337600,9,1025,4.817142857142857
3515223,4,B001CO42CA,"These past years, Warner Brothers have showed their classics from the Looney Tunes vault on DVD. Sadly, there was a huge announcement made, that Warner Brothers decided to stop making the Looney Tunes Golden Collections after this one. Which to me is an absolute dissapointment. After the last one, Golden Collection Volume 5, there were a few shocks from fewer Bugs Bunny Cartoons, to a seperate DVD collection from the Warner Brothers vault releasing a seperate series featuring Oscar-winning and nominated cartoons that showed well, but could've offered a bit more in variety. Now, what becomes of the final Looney Tunes Golden Collection. Just simply put, That's All Folks!

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 is the final edition of the long-running series, and brings here a lot less of your favorites from Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Instead, the DVD set instead focuses in mainly on the lesser-known shorts, and that shown widely from their Merrie Melodies beginnings from their early 30's days from M.G.M. days. The first disc is widely relevant of the fewer classics from the all-stars, which includes classics like Hare Trigger, which features the debut of Yosemite Sam, to Satan's Waitin', where Sylvester winds up in the Devil's world, where he slowly, loses his 9 lives in a grappling battle to capture Tweety. There are other shorts with lesser-known favorites like A Ham In A Role with The Goofy Gophers, the polite duo named Mac & Tosh which became Warner Brothers answer to Disney's Chip & Dale, and Dog Gone South with with Charlie Dog, who was always seeking a master of his own, and winds up in Southern Country after being kicked off a train.

The second disc is where the collection though gets pretty interesting, as it mainly highlights the classic cartoons from the World War II era. Most of these cartoons have been overlooked and not shown on television in over 20 years. The main highlights include cartoons like Heir Meets Hare, where Bugs Bunny winds up in Germany by mistake, and is wrangling with a German hunter. This cartoon also shows Bugs and the hunter ending up in a dance scene, that is the prelude into what later became the more famous dance scene from the Chuck Jones' classic What's Opera Doc? There are also other classics from Wacky Blackout and Rookie Revue here.

The third disc mainly shows the beginnings from some of the classic greats from Warner's days back in the 1930's, before Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd made their way into the mainstream. Then it was all mainly about charcters like the simple black & white cartoons, or widely known as two-tones like Bosko. While these gems will not appeal to new fans, but it mainly works as a rare delight for the hard core Looney Tunes fans. While the last disc, also shows some recognition to the favorite assorted nuts classics. These include some of the longtime favorites like the favorite Horton Hatches The Egg, which was loosely based on the Dr. Seuss children's book. On this disc, there are also other greats like Rocket-Bye Baby, where two different babies are delivered from two intergalatic worlds, and the Wilbur family has to deal with the misadventures of taking care of the Martian baby from Earth, and The Oily American, where a wealthy Indian owns a mansion and a pool, and goes on a moose hunt, but actually tries to capture a moose who is short in height. There also are a few extras here that are worth buying in the collection, including the very rare documentary about the legendary late Mel Blanc: A Man Of A Thousand Voices, and some of the classic Warner Brothers specials from the 70's and 80's including Bugs Bunny In King Arthur's Court, a spoof on the classic Mark Twain novel, A Conneticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.

All in all, it is honestly such a sad shame that Warner Brothers still could've had a whole lot more into the long-running Golden Collection cartoon DVD sets. Volume 6 isn't a bad buy for die hard fans, and it is well shown right here. I just wish that there could've been more highlights and cartoons from favorite characters like Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe Le Pew and Ralph Wolf & Sam Sheepdog throughout the series. Nevertheless, Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 ends what made Warner Brothers cartoons so remarkable over the years, and what animation fans have constantly forgotten about the greats for so long. I just hope though that Warner Brothers tries to do something else with these classic gems soon. Well, in the meantime, That's All Folks!, really.

Not as much Bugs Bunny on Disc 1 & 2 as other Golden Collections' but many other fantastic Looney Cartoons with Foghorn & Henry Hawk, Porkey Pig does his thing, plenty of great Daffy, and one of my favorite cartoons with Tweety is titled Satan's Waitin is here !!! Disc 4 is some stand alone great cartoons that don't have many of the popular Looney Tunes but are still very good by themselves. One cartoon on Disc 4, which is one of my childhood favs and didn't realize was here till I watched DVD set, is Chow Hound by the great Chuck Jones. The Dog keeps saying ""You Forgot To Get The Gravy"", fantastic cartoon. Disc 4 also has a great bonus feature on Mel Blanc that is a must watch. Its so amazing that one amazingly voiced actor could be the voice for basically all these great Looney Tunes characters. And as always there are other great bonus features on all of the Discs in this set.  Overall this Looney Tunes set is worth the 20$$ or so you will pay on Amazon, because these cartoons wonderful and rare and getting older every day.",1496793600,2,1156,4.2785388127853885
