I made a mistake when I ordered this DVD.
In this DVD Pastor Mike Hoggard makes extensive comments and describes links of activities of the
Bilderberg group with themes found in the Bible.
I was disappointed because I thought the DVD would be a documentary on present and past activities of the secretive Bilderberg group.
This DVD was of no interest to me.
