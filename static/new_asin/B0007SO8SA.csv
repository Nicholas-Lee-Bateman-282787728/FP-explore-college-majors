8051176,1,B0007SO8SA,"Dobson was a fool that got played by a master manipulator.  The idea that the only factor that turns a well-adjusted all-American boy into a serial killer is watching pornography is ludicrous.  If you watch the video you can see how Bundy's answers change to accommodate the biases of his interviewer.  Dobson had an agenda and he wasn't about to hear any nuances that deviated from that agenda.  Bundy grew up in the 1950s and 60s.  It wasn't like he could just dial up some hardcore porn on his computer.  Oh yeah, everyone that is in prison has an addiction to hardcore pornography...it's not drugs, not the influence of parental abuse or neglect, poverty, the lack of good educational opportunities, or plain old poor life choices, nope, just pornography.  It also galls me that Dobson's organization is still making money off of this tape.  How much of that money does the good Doctor donate to charities that prevent sexual violence do you suppose?",1413244800,6,954,4.809815950920245
8051177,5,B0007SO8SA,"As a pastor, I don't believe I've never watched a more powerful video on the addiction of pornography. I highly recommend this video for older teens and up. If you skip the part at the end that describes what hard-core porn is, it would be good for ages 12+. Just wish it was in DVD. If you spin it right, it's age only makes the message more authoritative because human nature hasn't changed and temptation has only gotten worse.",1357257600,5,430,4.455696202531645
8051178,5,B0007SO8SA,"This interview takes place in the final hours of serial killer Ted Bundy's life. He took the time and care to let people know the direction that porn can lead people. It is an addiction and like all addictions, it requires ever increasing highs. With both soft and hard porn on our magazine shelves, on tv, on the radio, in ads and on movie screens, little wonder that the U.S. is knee deep in the trafficking of people in the sex trade and there are increasing stories of kidnappings and assaults across the continent. America is the leading provider of porn in the world. What a terrible distinction. People need to wake up before it hits them in their own homes.",1349136000,8,665,4.5041322314049586
