It is quite corny and this is why I gave it four stars.  Nothing exciting happens, just a good movie with a lot of values.",1501718400,2,279,4.54
172630,1,0966691105,"This film was disappointing. It really was done to showcase the composer and his music and failed in the core goal. I mourned that Pamela seemed to not have a voice, that she seemed like a prisoner trapped by her Father and his faith. She did not seem to really show much beyond the fact that she really wanted to please her Father. I heard her question her faith but never get to a space where she seemed truly connected. The dialog was so limited throughout the film, I had difficulty even seeing these relationships as real. Beyond a few hair cut changes, I did not see Pamela grow as a person and I really did not see any kind of love in her eyes for her husband or her father, just an empty smile that was too fearful to show it was forced.",1501372800,2,745,4.180555555555555

172632,5,0966691105,"I think that this movie portrays dating and marriage in a biblical manner, with a focus on purity and respect for God and parents.
In listening to sermons on YouTube on relationships, the minister Paul Washer portrayed dating and marriage very similarly. He is one of the most biblical and godly preachers I have heard.
I was born-again late in life, 53; my third divorce wrecked me and afterwards, the Lord picked up the pieces. So this movie presented relationships extremely differently than I lived mine prior to salvation.  Yet as I learn to abide in God's word and prayer, I believe that He wants His children to conduct themselves in relationship as this movie portrays.",1500940800,3,677,4.836206896551724

172637,4,0966691105,"Very good movie .... had a great message for both boys and girls in regards to 'WAITING'.  This was done in a respectful way and reminded ME of when I was young and there used to be LIFE learning programs that were called 'AFTER SCHOOL SPECIALS' ....  They were like HALLMARK movies for kids and the entire family.  They always gave me sonething to think about.  Would definitely recommend for a family movie time with any age child , but I think ages 9 and up may be able to understand topic best.  I miss those after school specials !!!",1499904000,2,538,4.34

172640,5,0966691105,"When I was about 5 or 6 years old, this movie was shown on TV and my mom had my sister and I watch it. It struck me as a small child just how beautiful it is to remain pure before marriage. I remember saying ""When I'm sweet 16, I want to never have been kissed!!"" I am now 23 years old and I can say that, by the grace of God, I have remained pure (no kissing or sex or anything) all of my life!! And I am going to remain pure, waiting for the man that the Lord has picked out for me. This movie is a beautiful reminder of how wonderful it is to trust the Lord and wait until His timing comes. I recommend this for all ages!! :)",1492560000,16,628,3.7293233082706765

172644,4,0966691105,Excellent film. Message rarely heard these days. Parents knows more than teenagers think.

172646,5,0966691105,"I bought this movie around 10 years ago or so. I really enjoyed the movie because of the purity message. More people need to get on board with the message of purity in relationships. Life is not about sex, dating, or kissing. It's about loving God and our neighbors as we love ourselves.

172652,5,0966691105,"Though this movie is obviously low budget and lacks a few modern elements (hairstyles, clothes, etc), the principles are spot on!!! Many think that when people save their first kiss, it's this over-the-top, righteous attitude that they are exhibiting. Most of the time, that's not the case at all. If you kissed prior-to marriage and have a great, Godly marriage - that's wonderful!! But it's not the point. The point of this movie and the values behind it are this: Every kind of intimacy is sacred. And it's worth saving for your future spouse. YOU are worth the wait. No legalism. No self-righteousness. Just a desire to be pure in every way and give that gift to your spouse.

I had already decided to save my first kiss for marriage when I was introduced to this movie years ago and it really encouraged me and I plan to introduce it to my children when they are old enough. Those who laugh and criticize obviously are more concerned with modern adaptability than the wise principles given in this movie.",1414540800,4,1009,4.668539325842697

This is a movie inspired by the spirit of Jesus Christ.

172655,1,0966691105,"This was literally the worst movie I've ever seen!!! I believe in purity before marriage and I respect anyone who wants to wait til their wedding night to kiss, but this movie was CREEPY! The father is controlling and doesn't allow his daughter to think for herself. He doesn't let Pamela date anyone (not even at a high school basketball game) until she is over 18. The dad is present in every ""date"" Pamela and Frederick are together on (except for the first one...?) and he is there when Frederick proposes. Spoiler alert-- when they get married their ""pure"" married kiss isn't even shown (I guess it would compromise the purity of the actors) and WORSE, as they are about to kiss the screen pans to the father creepily smiling at them. It seems the screenwriter, Dave Christiano is completely afraid of sex even within the context marriage, as the terms are never mentioned and there is never joy between the pure couple once they're married. The topper is that on her wedding night, Pamela calls her dad from her wedding bed to pray with him ""one more time."" So many things are wrong with this movie, I really can't even communicate them all. This is embarrassing, even for a Christian film.",1390953600,4,1196,4.64622641509434

I grew up knowing the rules, but I wasn't content to wait for the Lord. I wanted it my way. Finally after awhile, I am ready to put into practice waiting for the wedding day. Its NOT worth it to get yourself all worked up in the physical. When you are dating you are suppose to be getting to know the other person. When you get physical you aren't thinking of getting to know the other person. Your mind goes places that go beyond the marriage day. I want to honor the Lord with my relationship and marriage. This film really spoke to m heart about making that commitment. You will have your whole married life to get physical with your spouse:)",1390176000,,823,4.316129032258065

I wish I had lived that way and was taught those things growing up...This was a beautiful movie with a powerful testimony and I highly recommend it for sons and daughters both young and old, and parents...

172669,5,0966691105,"This is not a high production movie in terms of budget and equipment used but it is well made and the story is something shared by many who are Christians. This is what earns it five stars.

The natural reaction of the flesh would be to scoff at such a story presented here. They would scoff because it holds virginity to it's highest standards and that before God. The movie presents a dedicated father's struggle to raise his daughter in the faith and later as she matures to seek to preserve her from the wolves she must walk admidst. It is a story of a parent's struggle to give her wisdom and pray for her to take hold of it with understanding and to walk God's way till she meets the one whom they pray for (THE husband whom God raised up for her as well she for him).

It is a movie that will endear the heart of every Christian parent concerning their children and hopefully the children also.

It took eight years for Christiano to finish this movie but it was worth it to God's glory. Again a simple budget but well made as Christiano ever shows dedication to learning his craft and with every success, greater budgets and aptness of hand as a journey man. A film maker as unto God and for His glory in Christ's name.

As for the title of the movie it comes from her father's dedication before God to pray with his daughter every night and finally after he gives her away and he is left alone she calls him to pray once more in thanksgiving. She asks him to pray with her once more but this time let her give the prayer (as in answer to all his prayers).

Some will say this movie is unreal in our day but such is the scoffing I spoke of and I say not so. It is a battle that has been going on since the beginning and with the Christian there is great hope for victory in Christ even in virginity to holy matrimony.

This is a movie worth adding to one's arsenal of educational and edifying Christian family media.

Enjoy.",1337385600,5,1932,4.233695652173913

Pam waits on the Lord and she is rewarded greatly! make me wish  that maybe I should have waited too. but, its ok, Pamela had a wonderful dad who made sure she knew the WORD. so even though she was a little distracted with a decoy boy, God showed up and she married the one who HE wanted her to have.

Too many young people have been hurt by the lack of respect our culture and media place on sexuality.  In America sex has become cheap.  A solid relationship between a husband and wife is priceless.  Sadly there is so much pain in America because of broken marriages and broken homes which have grown from this disrespect.  I have lived to see parents, and grandparents who were married for 30+ years, 60+ years......that to me is such a gift to kids and grandkids.  It is a real love,  that is not plastic or cheap and superficial.  My children see the difference and I pray for their sake and America's sake that people would go against the tide of the current media and hold onto what is so precious.....loving and honoring for a lifetime.",1284595200,3,840,4.590604026845638

172675,1,0966691105,"With bad dialogue, laughable acting, and awful cinematography, Pamela's Prayer is a shining example of a Christian movie turned into unintentional satire through a complete lack of respect for the art of filmmaking. This movie was, quite frankly, the funniest I've ever seen.

Comedic value aside, Pamela's Prayer has a moral point to make - and it's not the one you're expecting. The film's obsession with saving one's first kiss for marriage is handled so poorly that it actually appears to oppose the values it intends to support. Further, the ridiculousness of its argument against pre-marital kissing can be analogically applied to premarital sex. After viewing this movie, the only conclusion I had reached was that Christianity's view on premarital sex was just as ridiculous as this movie's view on kissing. In the end, my faith was -weakened- by this film.

And I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack!",1258329600,13,911,5.148648648648648

172681,2,0966691105,"It should first be pointed out that this movie is supposedly based on a true story, the daughter of one of the producers of the movie.  The premise is simple:  it is a (mortal) sin for a boy and girl to kiss before they are married.  So, the story follows Pamela from shortly after her mother dies until she is about to give her first kiss at her wedding.  While, the title is ""Pamela's Prayer,"" it would be better entitled, ""Pamela's Uptight Father's Prayer.""  He uses all kinds of psychological manipulation in the guise of religious piety to keep Pamela from going to Hell through kissing a boy before she is married.

I would like to add that right after I first saw this movie I called the Christiano's about it.  I can't recall if I talked to Rich or Dave, but whichever one it was, it was the rudest phone call I have ever experienced in relation to the movies.  In essence, he told me that I was going to Hell for not agreeing with him that it is a sin for teens to kiss!  He also insinuated that I didn't know enough about the movie business to evaluate the quality of his firm's movies.  [I worked in the movie & TV industry for quite a few years.  I've been in feature movies with two Academy Awards ""Best Actors"" as well as a regular in two TV shows.  Even two of my daughters were regulars on a TV show, missing school two days a week during the filming season.]

To say the least, I am not the least impressed with this movie, either its story or movie quality.  If you are a ""Pharisee Christian,"" one more interested in the rules than in love, then you might like this movie.  If you are a more typical Christian, even an Evangelical Christian, then this movie will seem bizarre or odd to you.  The only reason I gave it two stars is that it clearly shows how one can become more concerned with the rules than with living the Christian life of Truth, Freedom and Love.

[I HAVE to add that the movie cuts off just as the bride Pamela is about to kiss her new husband, apparently because the actors are not married and they don't want to film them 'sinning!']",1158796800,21,2073,4.274358974358974

Wow what a movie. the movie focuses a lot on the father daughter relationship. where the father prays for his daughter every night even nights when he is away on a business trip he still intercedes for her. There are times when Pamela rebels against her father and goes out on a date behind her fathers back later only to regret it. The movies tapps upon topics of family, prayer, dating and purity.

She was not allowed to date, and her father expected her to save her first kiss for the altar of marriage. These are hard standards, especially for a youth in our culture. While she rebels against them at one point, she comes to see that her father is right. Especially when she meets and marries her husband. The movie is low budget, and has mediocre acting. However the beauty of the story overides these factors. Much of this story is told through the effective use of music and image rather than words.

172686,4,0966691105,"The content of this movie is excellent.  But it is obviously low budget.  As a teaching tool for helping my daughters gain a godly perspective on purity, I think this movie is most helpful.
We are a homeschool family.  We are very desirous for our children to have a healthy, kingdom view of marriage and a sweet anticipation of intimacy with a future spouse.  We are of the view that our bodies are a gift from God to our mate and we can only give it the first time once.  Kissing, too, is a part of the whole beautiful ""package"".  Ofcourse we distinguish between affectionate family 'pecking' and, as my girls say 'married kisses'.
I have found that keeping things hidden and running from issues just leads to insatiable curiosity and opens the children up for perverse world views to seep into their thinking.  You have to be well aware of what is godly and healthy to be then able to recognize what is ungodly and unhealthy.  So, in our home, questions are always answered in truth - even the difficult and/or perhaps uncomfortable ones.  We have set clear standards, viewed as ""high"" by most of the world, but we veiw them as normal, healthy and wise life choices.
I don't mind my children speaking about kissing.  But I care very much 'what' they have to say and what thier 'feelings' are.  Otherwise I might find that my teaching isn't 'taking'.
And that prospect, to me, would be failure.
Pamela's Prayer can be helpful to parents who will take the time to truthfully share and listen with their adolecents and youths.  We were able to talk about several issues related to remaining pure (ie. true friends and prospective mates would join with us in protecting our virtue;  what God-given desire is designed to accomplish and what the benefits of postponing 'til marriage fleeting, emmediate physical pleasure are. As well as, what are the consequences of acting on these impulses outside of God's design.)  This video helped foster some great communication and sweet, intimate conversations with my oldest daughter.
I obviously recommend it to anyone willing to take the time to continue the line of thinking it will provoke.",1015459200,13,2134,4.763586956521739
172687,5,0966691105,"Finally, a film with good morals AND realistic dialogue.  This is no ""Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Visit Grandma's"" sappy love-fest.  Pam's Prayer tells it like it is.  You enter the halls of a real high school and witness the sinful underbelly of teen life.  As a teen myself, I could really relate to the ""cool"" predator male who brags to his pals about fabricated exploits with the unassuming virginal girl.  It's a story as true and as old as time.  The dialogue is bold, the costuming amazingly true to the era (the movie takes place between 1970 and present day) and Serena Orrego's acting is just breathtaking.  Before your very eyes she grows from a trusting crowd-follower to an unquestioning believer.  Her remarkable acting range takes her character all the way from an obedient daughter to a giving wife.  Pam's Prayer proves that one must cut one self off from anything that may lead to the remote possibly of any hint of temptation if one is to remain pure.  The character of Pamela is a shining example of a female who is brave enough to separate herself, with the gentle guidance of her father and husband, from any thought that may force her to do unchristian things.  A true inspiration.  Top notch indeed!",986947200,12,1222,4.658878504672897
172688,5,0966691105,"This excellent film shows the need of purity, and gives young people a reason to keep themselves through the tough teenage years. In looking at the present dating system, the continual breakups, it seems that dating is  a learning ground for divorce. For young people to recognize the beauty of  purity and the privilege of saving all of yourself for one other person is  vital. I would highly recommend this film.",949363200,3,414,4.802816901408451
7793920,3,0966691105,"At 50 minutes, this is a rather long and expansive bit of Christiano brothers filmmaking. As far as I can remember, this movie is about a girl who prays with her father every night right up to the moment before she goes to bed with her husband on their wedding night. There is a very mystical and haunting scene where the father sits in a chair and, in a kind of trance and through prayer, intervenes from a distance in a date his daughter is on. At one point the guy who eventually marries Pamela proves that he is an honest, stand-up guy by going the extra mile at work distributing Christian films. Also, Pamela's friend does ""something"" with her boyfriend--we never find out what. Overall, this film doesn't deliver the same power punch tour de force filmmaking of other Christiano brothers masterworks like the Daylight Zone and The Pretender. But, on the plus side, if you watch it twice in a row, the movie is pretty much a feature-length film.",1522108800,,951,4.567251461988304
7793921,5,0966691105,This would be a great movie for a youth group at church.  It was a little slow at times but the plot was good.  It was very low budget so there wasn't really great camera work. The actors were more non-professions but got the job done.  I believe a husband and wife produced the film.,1517875200,,284,4.127272727272727
