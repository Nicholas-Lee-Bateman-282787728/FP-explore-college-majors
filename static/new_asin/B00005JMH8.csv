1520623,4,B00005JMH8,"I don't know why I would look for a made for T.V. movie to be more accurate to literature than the big budget ""Hollywood"" movies but I had to try.  This is even farther removed from Homer & Virgil than ""Troy"" & that's saying a lot!  But this movie does entertain & if your a big Sword & Sorcery fan like I am it might be worth adding to your collection.  The movies always want to make Helen out to be this young victim of a abusive husband, but if you have read the classics she would be viewed as a ""Cougar"" by todays standards, a married woman in her mid 30's leaving her husband & 3 children to run off with the very young handsome Paris.  While Helen suffered loss due to war I don't recall her being mistreated by Menelaus.  It has been over 30 years since I have read the Homer & Virgil's works so I may be wrong but out of all the King's from Greece to war against Troy Menelaus makes it back home with Helen, while the majority of the others either die or suffer greatly.  Hollywood seems to avoid the whole morality issue.",1456531200,,1032,4.135

1520681,5,B00005JMH8,I've watched several versions of the movie and read a lot of the literature about the event. Although there is no imperical evidence as to what happened. This movie was seemingly close to the writings.,1437609600,,201,4.771428571428571
1520682,4,B00005JMH8,"I have always had an interest in the story since seeing the 'Rossana Podesta' 'Jacques Sernas' version as a child (which also starred
'Stanley Baker' as the legendary Greek warrior 'Achilles'
This movie made for TV back in 2003 probably follows 'Homer's Illiad' the closest in truth, trying to follow the Ten-Year siege described
by the famous writer.
Of course until the late 1900's 'Troy' had never been found raising the argument of whether the legendary battles ever took place, though
of course the Greek brothers 'Agamemnon' and 'Menelaus' of 'Mycenae' are indeed well documented.
The question I guess is if these great figures and Troy are a matter of historic fact, did 'Homer's' story take place as he described, were
these great figures he tells of a matter of fact ?
Of course the use of the Trojan-Horse by the Greeks to change the course of the siege, is something that will never be proved or indeed
disproved.....either way, it's a great story.
This film follows young 'Helen's' (Sienna Guillory) journey from a petulant teen into the most desirable woman in the known World, the many
suitors, the oath between the Greek leaders when 'Menelaus' (James Callis) won Helen's hand, the misuse of his prize by 'Menelaus' and
then the visit to 'Sparta' by 'Paris' to secure peace between the Greek kingdoms and Troy, the seduction of 'Helen' by 'Paris' followed by
insulting 'Menelaus's pride and indeed hospitality by taking 'Helen' back to Troy'
'Agememnon'(Rufus Sewell) supports his brother in trying to secure the release of 'Helen' though his motives were to have power over the 'Aegean' by destroying all that 'Troy' had stood for.
The sister of 'Hector' (Daniel Lapaine) and 'Paris' 'Cassandra' (Emilia Fox) had told her father 'King Priam' (John Rhys-Davis) when 'Paris' was born that the boy would bring destruction of the Trojan city in years to come, which lead to the child being cast out of the Royal household and left to die, though, found and brought up as a shepherd's son until being accepted back as young man.
Many will find this a little tangled and much less dramatic than the 2004 spectacle 'Troy' in which the battle scenes are pretty spectacular and legendary warriors 'Price Hector' (Eric Bana) and 'Achilles' (Brad Pitt) were far more prominent.
As mentioned earlier, this production though not as spectacular as Troy does follow 'Homer's' story somewhat closer.

1520686,4,B00005JMH8,"I am an educator who teaches the Trojan War as a unit of study in a Greek Literature course. This TV movie is very successful at covering the bulk of the storypoints of the Troy story whereas other movies focus on a single episode of the Troy myth or they even abridge the myth altogether. This film covers the Judgment of Paris, Theseus kidnapping Helen, The Oath of Tyndareus (sort of), The theft of Helen, The wooden horse, the murder of Agamemnon among other important events in the epic Troy myth. The whole film is executed quite well given that it was probably not a big budget production, and they manage to avoid cheesy cameos by gods and goddesses ala 1963 Jason and the Argonauts. The acts of the gods are alluded to by a mist or a turn of fate, like when Paris's helmet strap breaks in single-combat with Menelaus. Overall, the filmmakers appeared to be trying to create a historical piece to show us what the Trojan War might have looked like had it actually happened.

The downside to this movie is that the roles of Hector and Achilles, two of the most important characters in the Troy myth, are downplayed substantially. Both warriors are reduced to relatively flat or static characters along with the conflict between the two. At one point, Achilles claims to ""fight for High King Agamemnon"" which is not accurate to the myth at all really. While the Agamemnon/Achilles conflict is downplayed, the Agamemnon and Menelaus sibling rivalry is put at the forefront resulting in an uncharacteristic-of-the-myth literal rape of Helen by Agamemnon during the siege of Troy. I am assuming that this brother versus brother storyline was developed as a way to avoid any litigation by the producers of Troy starring Brad Pitt which stays true to the Iliad's storyline of Achilles vs. Agamemnon and Hector and came out around the same time.

You can tell that, at points, the writers really gloss over some aspects of the story for time's sake. As a nearly three hour television movie, I am sure they wanted to get through the whole thing in two to three nights rather than a week. The viewer also doesn't really get the feeling that nine years have passed during the course of the war. Other than a little gray in the hair of some actors and actresses, it didn't seem that long.

John Rhys-Davies gives a convincing performance as King Priam while Rufus Sewell comes off a little one-dimensional as Agamemnon. It seems the director had him looking mean into the camera one too many times. Sienna Guillory expertly interprets Helen as a wispy, naive girl caught between powerful men in high positions, her father, Tyndareus, brother Pollux, husband Menelaus, creeper Agamemnon, and lover Paris. She is convincing as the ""face that launched a thousand ships"" with her beauty alone. Costumed in light, airy flowing clothes that make her look like she walked out of a painting, the director and cinematographer cheapen her beauty and performance by having her riding a horse bra-less in slow motion. That was unnecessary. My favorite performance, although a brief one in the film, is that of Stellan Skarsgard as King of Athens Theseus. Skarsgard inhabits the danger loving, yet wise and cautious hero quite well. His only purpose in the movie is to demonstrate how easily Helen falls in love with her captors.

If you love myth and the Trojan War story, then you will enjoy this movie. I doubt you will have any cringe worthy moments. You may be disappointed at some of the parts of the story that are missing, but the great thing about myth is that we can keep going back to it for new and different stories to be told. This is a good retelling of the story. I would have given this five stars if the Hector/Achilles storyline was beefed up. Sidenote: What about Patroclus? Entirely missing. Oh well. Perhaps like winning the Trojan War, creating the perfect Troy movie will take a minute.",1433980800,3,3893,4.745937961595273

1520775,5,B00005JMH8,"I was disappointed with 2004's big budget ""Troy,"" and when I saw this version of the story of the Trojan War on You Tube I watched some of it, not expecting much since it was a TV movie.  But it proved to be unexpectedly good. Told from an unusual perspective--that of King Menelaus, who is presented more sympathetically than he usually is and as a victim of his brother Agamemnon--it takes a few other unusual twists along the way.

Agamemnon is presented as the real villain, a ruthless tyrant bent on conquest and self-glory who sacrifices his own daughter in order to get a favorable wind for his fleet.  He also has eyes for Helen and makes it a point to rape her when Troy finally falls.  As in Greek mythology, he pays for his crimes when he is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra at war's end.

Helen, in this version, is more a free-spirited teenager than a princess.  Cassandra is seen as madwoman whose prophecies her father, King Priam, has grown to rely on, but in the end he becomes disenchanted with her and has her locked away.  The scene of the Trojan Horse being brought into Troy is done better than in the 2004 version.

Helen of Troy does leave out some elements of the Iliad, such as the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles.  But overall this version of the story of the Trojan War is a good one, and all things considered, well worth the modest price.",1397865600,3,1376,4.472

1520819,4,B00005JMH8,"Bettany Hughes takes the viewer on a tour of the land of Homer and Mycenaean Greece in this DVD centered on the woman known as ""Helen of Troy"" from the Iliad.

Ms. Hughes takes the viewer on a guided tour of Greece and Asia (modern day Turkey) in order to search for the woman known as Helen beginning in her native Sparta where we are introduced to the culture, dress and politics of Mycenaean age Greece. The DVD goes to great lengths not only to find what life was like for women like Helen in Mycenaean culture but also looks at the remarkable independent spirit of Greek women of that age. Even their appearance is a subject of the investigation.

The video, of course, centers on Helen's role in the competition/rivalry between Ilios (Troy) on the periphery of the Hitite Empire and the up-and-coming Greeks across the Aegean sea represented by Mycenae and the overlordship of Agamemnon. The politics of the ancient world is covered as is the military technology of the day.

The story of the Trojan War is told and explained with Helen at the center and I think it gives the viewer already familiar with the story of the Trojan War a different ""angle"" or perspective on that ancient of conflicts which comes down to us through Homer's poem.

The only criticism is that, over and over again, Helen is referred to as a ""heroine"". I suspect that it's too ""politically-incorrect"" to refer to her as a powerless person caught up in events far greater than her own story but that's exactly what she was. She wasn't a heroine in any way and I found the constant reference to her in this fashion to be forced and annoying.

Notwithstanding, this is a well-made production and covers many topics from ancient religion to culture to warfare quite well. It was informative and enjoyable and, with one criticism, still garners four stars from this viewer.",1386288000,,1850,4.662576687116564

1520821,5,B00005JMH8,"Channel ""4"" is the U.K.'s version of PBS, Bettany Hughes was at the top of her form in the early 2000s period, and this most excellent video shows the armchair historian what it must have been like in the Trojan War period.

Personally I like Ms. Hughes way of telling the story; it's both intelligent and coy.  It makes some of the dry stuff interesting.  The story gives the viewer the background of the ancient Greeks, the story of the reconstructed events, and Ms. Hughes giving tours of the actual fields of battle.  You've got to admire Ms. Hughes cameria crew because they go to great lenghts to show what the old Middle East looked like.  Additionally, I enjoyed the costumed characters and properly researched demonstrations.  Last, Ms. Hughes goes out of her way to display art from the period or give quotes to Homer.  It's quite good.

Now, I will admit that Hellen isn't as good as ""Spartans"", one of my favorite historical documentaries of all time, or ""The Minoans"", that is my most favorite historical documentary of the very ancient world.

1520824,3,B00005JMH8,"In ""Helen of Troy,"" (2005), Bettany Hughes, a highly attractive and educated young Englishwoman, explores Greece and the eastern Mediterranean Sea.  She is hoping to prove that the famous Helen was an actual woman, a Bronze Age queen, and to discover more about the woman blamed for causing the Trojan War, a presumably real war that was immortalized by the ancient Greek known as Homer in his long poetic masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iliad/dp/B00847VIBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iliad</a>.  This British television production by the BBC, which has run and is currently running on American public broadcasting stations, is available in a one disk, two hour format, with, thankfully, subtitles, as the nicely-bred Hughes speaks softly.

Unfortunately, on this outing, archaeology is not as helpful to Hughes as it has been in some of her others.  Still, she manages to throw some light on the life of a Bronze Age queen, and on life in general as it might have been lived in that ancient time.  (Archaeology does indicate the plentiful presence of opium in the time and area, Mycenae, of Helen's birth.)  There is an interesting segment with experts in ancient weapons that helps to show how the conflict in Helen's name would have been fought, as Hughes does her best to  unravel the reality from the hoary myths and put flesh on ""the face that launched a thousand ships,"" then considered the most beautiful woman in the world.

The London-born Hughes, the child of actors, discovered an interest in classical history at the age of four, after watching a documentary on the ancient King Tutankhamen of Egypt. As a teenager, she learned Latin and Greek. She won a scholarship to St. Hilda's College, Oxford. Upon graduation, she was offered a fellowship at Britain's highly esteemed Victoria and Albert Museum, but instead chose a research grant that allowed her to travel through the Balkans and Asia Minor, examining ancient public spectacles and amusements. This vital young woman, who seems always to have been bound for glory herself, has written articles, and, in 2005, also published a book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helen-of-Troy-Goddess-Princess-Whore/dp/1400041783/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore</a>, on this material. Hughes wrote and presented a radio series on medieval history. And she has written and presented numerous popular TV documentaries for the BBC, PBS, and the Discovery Channel.

The production under discussion is not able to document its subject as well as the latter two productions; still, it is interesting, and does succeed in holding up a mirror to Helen's beautiful face, presenting its information accessibly.

1520826,4,B00005JMH8,"A V-E-R-Y interesting take on the story nobody really knows. Never have I expected less of a movie and gotten more than with this version. This Helen is, in her own pre-Cyclopean-age way, more engaging than all others. This Helen is provocative and devious - and a problem child. The face that launched those ships is brooding and darkly smug. Do not forget she and Menelaus lived happily ever after. The dynamics of what could bring so much distress are intriguing and, up to a point, even logical. Menelaus is played by a younger James Callis (yes, THAT one) probably months before he took on the Baltar role. Oddly, there are moments, too, where the music sounds (prophetically, I mused) like that composed for Galactica.

The slaughter of Iphigenia (a likely occurence for those times) concludes part 1 and is the benchmark by which those men who destroyed Troy must be judged not as great warriors but mere butchers. History somewhat supports the fact that some Achaeans (yet to be called Greeks) united to steal and plunder their way through the Eastern Mediterranean around 1250 BC - only to be swept away themselves within a generation, probably by the same violence they incited; the presumed decade-long assault on Troy was a sustained military campaign on small coastal cities and it occupied several generations of warriors (the Trojans were neither Greek, nor Hittite, but likely related to the proto-Latin Thracians, of whom a nation survives North of the Danube today; myth says Aeneas escaped the sack of Troy to go West and establish a Latin, but not Italian, Rome). The characters are almost inverted to our perception of them so far: Agamemnon the determined killer; Paris is the ultimate outsider; Helen the ultimate trophy wife (with an eerie reminder, whilst dressed with head jewels, of Schliemann's own mail-order bride similarly decorated with treasures found at Troy in 1873, ostensibly Helen's own). And we finally get more than a name from Cassandra and visual proof that bringing the Greek Horse inside the walls was a messy procedure.

There are a few outstanding lines in an otherwise lame script (""You're a smudge on history's ledger, but you're my brother""), equally balanced by audaciously idiotic references to Byzantium or monkeys in Thrace - geographic tips for the low-information viewer, I suppose. And when was the last time you've seen a real garden in a ""Greek-themed"" movie? British accents are there, Achilles and Hector barely, CGI ships sail too tightly, the walls and towers of Troy are accurately crenelated but the landscape perhaps too steep and the history (or myth) gets seriously off-track in the second half. The rape scene at the end is disturbing. Movie is rated for originality.

Michael Wood's In Search of the Trojan War, both book and TV series, is an impressive excursion through the reality of the Iliad, for those so inclined (but Michael, there were no Hungarian celts in 1250 BC). Two scenes in the movie accurately depict javelins as a personal combat weapon and Aechean (bronze) swords breaking at the hilt - bronze was later replaced by quality steel forged by (and purchased from) Thracians living as far as modern Transylvania.",1365638400,4,3197,4.99437148217636

It never bogs down in the ""Helen was a whore"" thing that other films about her have. She was not a whore, nor was she some bubble-headed bimbo. She was a woman of power.
Hughes is a good presenter and people should really pay more attention to what she has to say, as opposed to what she looks like. She is concise and not pompous. All in all she comes off as very likeable.
I show this to my high school students as a prelude to our reading and study of both ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"" and it's great when I look around the room and see that everyone is focused on the film. The section on chariot warfare is also fascinating by the way.",1332720000,,940,4.256983240223463
1520879,2,B00005JMH8,"Two worlds waged war over her beauty, and she brought an empire to its knees.

This enthralling television series takes us into the world of Helen of Troy, the woman ""whose face launched a thousand ships."" The story begins in the royal palace of Troy as a baby's first cries pierce the evening. The Queen has just given birth to her second child when her first, Cassandra, known for having visions and dreams, comes screaming into the room. ""Kill him!"" she cries. ""Kill him! If he lives, Troy will burn!"" Because she deemed the child male before even the doctors knew, her father (John Rhys-Davies) takes her words as truth. He orders the court council to take the baby boy to the tallest mountaintop and throw him off the cliffs. The man is unable to murder an innocent child and instead leaves him there. The child is found by a local goat farmer, who calls him Paris.

Many years later, Paris (Matthew Marsden) is a grown man who loathes the brutality of Troy and longs for a beautiful woman. He is visited in a vision by three of the goddesses, who offer him either riches beyond comparison, power above all other, or Aphrodite... beauty of the ages, found in the form of a neighboring kingdom's younger princess, Helen (Sienna Guillory). He sees her face, and she witnesses him in the waters of a costal village. Helen's older sister is being married to Agamemnon (Rufus Sewell), heir of yet another kingdom. When his eyes fall upon Helen, Agamemnon sees only great beauty. Aware of her increasing lure over men, Helen flees the courtyard and is kidnapped by vagabonds. Instead of harming her, the captors treat her like royalty. She comes to love her kidnapper just in time to see him perish at the hand of her brother, who is also fatally wounded. Her father calls her a curse upon all men who bear her company, and offers her willingly to any kingdom.

Paris has journeyed to Troy in order to fight in the games and win back the bull the king's captain of the guard has stolen as a prize. Cassandra (Emilia Fox) recognizes him as the child who should have perished long ago. His parents are overcome and welcome him into the palace, where he is groomed as heir to the throne. When Agamemnon's younger brother makes his claim on Helen, Paris is sent as an ambassador to discuss various land treaties. The same day she is paraded before his royal court, Paris arrives. They recognize one another from the vision they shared so many years before. Their friendship will become dangerous and ultimately lead all Roman kingdoms to war against Troy for the recovery of a queen and the defeat of an empire. Some are motivated by greed, others by lust, yet through it all the passion of Helen and Paris burns brightly. Taken at face value, this is a stunning network adaptation. The filming is more breathtaking than anything I've seen in Hollywood. They use unique camera angles and close-ups in order to build tension and imply great drama.

One of the finest moments is when Cassandra realizes that the young man fighting her younger brother (Daniel Lapaine) is the child she ordered should be executed. The acting is incredible... everyone reacts with great feeling and passion and are given a fantastic script to work with. Even if you know nothing of Troy, you immediately understand the motivations behind everyone's actions. The ""casting of lots"" for Helen, her kidnapping, even the fabled Trojan horse. With a fantastic cast behind it, the production team went all out to recreate a believable empire of splendor. Various palaces and courtyards are constructed in breathtaking beauty. Most of the computer animation cannot be told from the real thing. It's really quite lovely to watch and has a marvelous score.

I knew going in there was bound to be some sex and violence, but I didn't expect to be bombarded with blatant nudity. Many of Helen's outfits are sheer but she also has some scenes in which she wears nothing at all. Throw in a rape scene and after the credits roll, on reflection one wonders why they spent three and a half hours of their life investing in a film that was such a letdown.",1332374400,,4110,4.67911479944675

1520881,2,B00005JMH8,"Having seen the 1956 ""Helen Of Troy"" yesterday, I was interested in this made-for-TV version. But it resembles the classic legend as much as dry clay can be made into a wheel. Nice touch of including Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter to appease Artemis, though. However, that DOES NOT make up for the egregious liberties taken with the legend, though there were some-very few, i might add-interesting moments, including -SPOILER!!!- Agamemmnon's watery demise at the hands of Clytemnestra. Achilles, a major character in the legend, looks more like a WWF wrestler and a one-dimensional selfish s.o.b. rather than the noble warrior depicted in ""The Iliad"" and Wolfgang Petersen's epic film ""Troy."" Sienna Guillory was okay, but nowhere near as good as Diane Kruger as Helen, Prince Hector was sadly reduced to a bit part, and though John Rhy-Davis was adequate as King Priam, his role was also much reduced in the film, and Peter O'Toole was much better. Overall, the acting was not that good, the battle scenes looked fake and the script-something the gods of Mount Olympus would strike the screenwriter dead for. Avoid this film at all costs, and stick with ""TROY.""",1313366400,2,1170,5.036082474226804

1520883,3,B00005JMH8,"I purchased this series with the hopes of using it in my own classroom (high school) to supplement my unit on the Trojan War. I might mention that this unit is my favorite to teach and that I take a lot of pride in what I bring to my students being entertaining and informative. Brat Pitt's Troy is too over the top and inaccurate to show the students, so I continue to amass mythology films to show bits and pieces of. I watched this series twice to hunt for usable material because it was apparent very quickly that showing it in its entirety would be a mistake. Like ""Troy"" and the new ""Clash of the Titans"", this series has taken a lot of dramatic license with the story that my students would know through text. The story is decidedly lacking in showing the connection of the people to the gods of Olympus, and without the understanding of the role Aphrodite plays throughout the whole story a good deal of the tale is lost. The portrayal of some of the major characters is wrong and some characters pivotal to the war are missing (like Patroclus). There is nudity and a rape scene that most teachers will not be able to use in the classroom. The series just has too many misses.

  I use only a few scenes from this film to supplement the unit. The scenes I find helpful to use are: The taking of Helen by Theseus, the goddesses approaching Paris to choose who is the fairest, the sacrifice of Iphaginia (though she is a very little girl) creates a real impact on the audience, as well as the murder of Agamemnon (it is in a bath, and I can share that the location is not Troy as it is in the series but instead back at his residence after the war). These are the only scenes that I found very useful to my instruction, and if you, like me, want everything to be ""just so"" then I would recommend you purchase this dvd just to have a few bits to show,in conjunction with bits from ""Troy"", but if you are looking for something to show in the mythology unit uninterrupted - I think you should keep going and look into Armand Assante's ""Odyssey"", or Jim Hensen's ""Storyteller Series""",1300233600,3,2085,4.354755784061696

This goes beyond the movie Troy and tells Helen's story. Helen in this film is seen to be stronger than in her other portrayals and a woman who just can't seem to catch a break. They also go a bit into Paris' back story and actually do both stories justice. They even bothered to tell how the Trojan War came about even before it started with the oath taken by the leaders of the Greeks.

The siege and sack of Troy are done very nicely in this movie without being too bloody, too long, or too anything else. The ending is also pretty satisfying because I don't believe any other movie ends like it does. It wasn't 100% correct, but still different.

Things needed to be sped up but overall, it's still a nice film. The main problem for me was the woman who played Helen. She was not at all believable and I will tell you why.

Helen of Troy is supposed to be Zeus' daughter and the most beautiful woman in the world! Who picked this lanky, awkward and only semi-attractive lady to play this role? With all the beautiful actresses and models (who you could have trained for this) why on earth would the casting crew pick this woman to be Helen? I couldn't get into the film more because of her! This woman isn't beautiful at all. She's attractive, but not close to being able to wear the title of Most Beautiful Woman. Please! I know people down the street that are prettier than her! She wasn't even prettier than the women on the movie!  That is what lost me. I managed to get through the film but I could not believe that this lady was supposed to be the ""face that launched a thousand ships"". Please! I couldn't and did not buy it. On top of that she couldn't even act and was way too old for the part! Helen was a child! This lady was obviously in her mid-thirties trying to play young. She was pathetic and very boring. She was the worst person that could have been picked to be Helen. I laughed everytime someone said she was beautiful. Also, didn't Helen have dark hair?

This casting catastrophe killed most of the movie for me. Newsflash to filmmakers, when a character is supposed to be so breathtakingly beautiful, make sure that the actress who plays her is!

1520958,5,B00005JMH8,"Bettany Hughes' Helen of Troy video is just the sort of thing many professional critics loathe. Why?  Because it cannot be easily stuffed into a genre and pigeonholed.  Is it a history?  Is it a love story?  Is it a cautionary tale or an Rx for deathless fame?  Is it all of these things?  Poor critics, lucky viewers.

Why are we viewers so fortunate?  Well, because this quest to find the essence of ""the most beautiful woman in the world"" is stuffed full of the kinds of things we aficionados of history ""lite"" love.  It's got war, romance, social/cultural commentary, dress up and primary research involving pine resin wine. It also has ancient weapons, archeology, history, mythology, play acting:  in short, the kitchen sink.  We also get a free tour of relevant sites in Greece and in Anatolia.

What are all these devices in aid of (sorry about that pesky preposition)?  They help the viewer find some kind of truth about a mystery-bound woman who (if she's truly something more than a singer's torrid poppy dream) was either a plaything of the gods or of her own libido.

Ms. Hughes, an Oxford-trained historian, is an author and the creator of other BBC/PBS Greek-inspired television programs.  For those who agree with Kit Marlow that, ""all is dross that is not Helena,"" she's also written a book which explores her enigmatic subject in more depth than a two-hour TV production can provide.  ""Helen of Troy:  The Story Behind the Most Beautiful Woman in the World"" was the book's title.  The current printing is now being sold as ""Helen of Troy:  Goddess, Princess, Whore.""  It's good to be reminded, from time to time, that marketing types invariably seek the lowest common denominator.

 Using surviving ancient sources, the video explains Helen's background and what her life as a high-born Spartan might have been like.  Ms. Hughes notes that, ""Helen would...always be linked with passion and pain,"" and that she was the sort of woman who, ""walked hand-in-hand with spirits, deities and demons.""

Presenter Hughes uses the services of make-up artists and ancient weapons experts to help her flesh out the shade of Helen and the Trojan War environment.  In the first instance, a model is transformed from a pedestrian young woman into the image of a powerful Bronze-Age queen.  The end result of a little paint and a little art is startling.  During another scene, several weapons experts, kitted out as Greek warriors, demonstrate cuts and checks, using spears, swords and shields.  It's effective, but the most powerful show-and-tell moment comes when these men roll out two new-built chariots and maneuver them on the plain at Troy.  Seeing those vehicles in that place is, from this reviewer's standpoint, far more effective than what the History Channel might have done using hordes of computer-generated cartoons.  The shades of Homer's heroes must have stirred and smiled.

In fact, Ms. Hughes' story telling is so evocative that, sometimes, we can't help but feel that if only she opened a door a little faster at Mycenae or turned a corner more quickly at Troy, we might actually be able to catch a flesh-and-blood glimpse of ""La Belle Helene,"" before she could slip back into the shadows of time and myth.

No, Bettany Hughes Helen can't be easily categorized, anymore than could the original Helen.  So what?  Just slip the disc into the machine, tip some water into the Ouzo, sit back and enjoy the ride.",1212278400,12,3430,4.887348353552859
1520999,3,B00005JMH8,"The first part of the party is beautiful, I think one gets a real sense of the story of Helen ( a very attractive) Sienna Guillory, a beautiful child bride, full of life and youthful passion, forced into marriage by an emotionally abusive father in a loveless marriage to King Menelaus of Sparta (James Callis), and the scene where she is paraded naked in front of Menelaus' cronies shows something of what she really was- a beautiful pawn of powerful and selfish, usually ruthless men, although Menelaus will later show to Helen the gentler more merciful side of his character.
The prophecy of Cassandra (Emilia Fox) from the beginning is very powerful, Bettina Paris is also phenomenal in the beginning of the movie as the young Cassandra, and I cannot fault he elopement of Paris (Matthew Marsden) with Helen, indeed it is done in a powerfully romantic way.
Agamemnon is portrayed  perfectly by Rufus Sewell as the greedy, ruthless, scheming, power-hungry villain.

The portrayal of Helen and her fate is in my opinion faultless, but the story of the actual Trojan War is butchered beyond recognition.
Achilles (Joe Montana) was not Agamemnon's mindless goon, and it actually quite ironic him killing Hector (Daniel Lapaine) as a tribute to Agamemnon. Achilles hated Agamemnon and had refused to fight for him, he killed Hector as revenge for Hector slaying in battle Achilles cousin Patroclus (not mentioned in this film).
The entire characters of Achilles and Hector are completely warped, with Hector being reduced to a paltry minor entity.
The movie is somewhat redeemed at the end by the slaying of Agamemnon by his wife Clytemnestra (Katie Blake) at the end of the movie, in revenge for Agamemnon's sacrifice of their little daughter and his rape of Helen, as well as Menelaus' mercy and forgiveness of Helen.

1521003,5,B00005JMH8,"I found Bettany Hughes very beautiful and couldn't take my eyes off her in this program as she explored sources of information about Helen of Troy, a reaction that seems very appropriate given Helen's reputation. Hughes has done a previous program on Sparta which rehabilitates them somewhat and is rumored as making another one on Socrates.

This 2005 PBS broadcast runs for two hours and covers a lot of ground. Hughes states she is interested in exploring how a Bronze Age Queen such as Helen might have lived. Her premise is that there was really a Helen and that the story of the part she played in the Trojan War is based on fact. This approach, which ignores Helen's mythological roles, enables Hughes to restrict herself to the archaeological record, where the life of the Bronze Age elite of Greece has left some trace.

The written record is not too helpful. Homer contents himself with calling Helen the most beautiful woman without giving further details, knowing his audience will fill in the blanks themselves. But, examining Homer closely, it is possible to see how many details he writes about were of an earlier time than his own and reflect the passing down of an oral tradition from as early as the 12th century BC, the time of the War. Just as Michael Wood did in In Search of the Trojan War, Hughes finds experts who can reconstruct Bronze Age weaponry from Homer's descriptions. It seems there is a lot of recoverable detail about how people lived in those times. But all this is supporting detail and doesn't help much where Helen is concerned.

Hughes drives from Mycenae to Sparta, crosses the Aegean to Troy, travels up the Hellespont to Istanbul for a taste of what Troy might have seemed like in its heyday, then travels east to explore the Hittites, the dominant political power of the Bronze Age in western Asia. While filling in a lot of social and political detail, Hughes is not able to fully demonstrate one of her major points, the relative freedom and access to power accorded to women in many societies of that time. There's really not enough evidence to make more than conjectures.

There is another aspect to Helen that Hughes does not really explore, as her search is for a historical figure. Helen is a daughter of Zeus, king of the Greek gods. She and her sister Clytemnestra were hatched from an egg, even though her mother, Leda, was of human form (though divine). Her brothers were the gods Castor and Pollux. Both Helen and Clytemnestra were to prove fatal to the Greek forces through their involvement with the brothers Agamemnon, leader of the Greek army and married to Clytemnestra, and Menelaus, married to Helen.

The Greeks often gave divine honors to their ancestors. If the involvement of Zeus and Aphrodite in Helen's tale are seen as part of this process, then the bloody feud of the Atridae, detailed in Aeschylus' Oresteia and which was an indirect cause of the Trojan War, as well as the story of the Seven against Thebes and of Oedipus, of Perseus, of Jason and Medea and of the Trojan War itself can be read as history, with the very large qualification that the stories, based on fact but created to gain tribal and clan renown, were passed on as part of songs in honor of the ancestors and in rituals enacted at family shrines. In this process the ancestors became heroes, the heroes became gods and children of gods. Five hundred years after these Bronze Age societies had passed away a gifted poet named Homer, who definitely did not ascribe to the religious beliefs of the age he depicted, recreated one such story: so tale became legend, became ritual, became ceremonial song and then became one of the world's greatest poems. Finding the historical elements in this is not an easy job.

Had Hughes wished to she could have looked at Bronze Age rituals that evidently did give status and authority to women and which can be seen on the surviving frescoes from Minoan Crete, thought to be the parent civilisation to that of Mycenean Greece. Women were bare breasted, their femininity was honored, they predominated in ceremonies below ground to invoke the snake goddess who gave wisdom and the bull god who gave life (I can't help thinking of the Canaanite Eve who might have been once such a priestess/goddess). Medea could have been another such figure, as was the Pythoness who gave way to Apollo at Delphi.

The trouble with looking at the past is that other societies had vastly different ways of looking at things than we do. We notice skin color, many ancient societies didn't (which Roman Emperors were black?) We like facts, ancient societies didn't think facts were nearly as important as clan honour. We separate concepts such as patriotism and religion, the Greeks didn't. Nobody's going to find a biography of Helen or a history of the Trojan War surviving on clay tablets because nobody in the Bronze Age had thought of such things.

From the remains we have: a few battered artifacts, an excavated city's outline, deductions from a few lines of poetry, historians such as Hughes try to interpret a vanished way of life. The lack of evidence means there can be more than one such interpretation, and none conclusive. This is the fascination of the past.

One sad fact Hughes is able to confirm is that the scale of things was much smaller than we imagine. Smaller cities, smaller populations, fewer soldiers and ships, raids more common than battles, deaths (despite Homer's gruesome descriptions) more often among the peasantry than the nobility. ""The face that launched a thousand ships"" was said of Helen almost 3000 years after her time, the tale having grown with the telling.",1191283200,41,5661,4.780163599182004
1521004,4,B00005JMH8,"Ronni Kern's 2003 re-write of Homer's epic ""Iliad"" is interesting and entertaining.  Sienna Guilloy, in the title role, plays ""Helen of Troy"" very much like modern Americans want to see the ancient beauty queen... with compassion, concern, gallant heroism, and decorum.  Helen's is an ancient love story retold here in a little over three hours.  (The wretched length of this movie, with two DVDs!, keeps it from earning the fifth star.)

John Rhys-Davies and Maryam D'abo give great, if too brief, performances as Troy's King and Queen.  Rufus Sewell is brilliant, and frightening, as the murderous Agamemnon.  And one wants to stand and cheer with the demise of Joe Montana's Achilles at the hands of Matthew Marsden's Paris (both exceptional portrayals!).

The best parts of this flick are the beautiful out door settings and battle scenes.  Dramatic rocky cliffs over blue oceans present the impressions of the ancient Aegean.  One feels apart of the Grecian landscape with this movie.

In battle, the Greeks would have certainly jumped from their ships into the surf to charge ashore.  The Trojans would have definitely rained down clouds of arrows upon their attackers.  The fighting choreographies here are brilliant and instructive.  The clash of these titans and the melee that follows reflect, from a distance of 4000 year ago, what probably happened.  The Trojan Horse is also very imaginative and convincing (the Greeks would have built it from available materials, as this horse depicts).

Purists will correctly say that this screenplay does not present Homer accurately.  But this film never makes that claim- its basic idea is not attributed to the Greek poet.  This film is, rather, for 21st century amusement with an ancient novelistic flavor.  It's worth the viewing.",1185408000,,1786,5.185314685314685

But I found it impossible to believe this woman was the most beautiful woman in the world, whose appearance so bewitched and fascinated men that they would kill and die for her. The actress cast as Helen is certainly pretty, but in a rather waif-like and generic ""Vogue"" way that is certainly not representative of classical ideals of beauty in any way. Helen should not be merely ""pretty"", like most modern magazine models are, but her beauty should be more unusual and striking. For a perfect example of this kind of beauty, I refer you to Leelee Sobieski as the nymph Deianeira in the 2005 TV version of ""Hercules"". Now that's a Helen.",1158710400,5,780,4.742647058823529
1521007,3,B00005JMH8,"Personally, I found the movie entertaining and did get more than a few chuckles out of the present handling nad mischaracterization of the Greek story.  It has little or nothing to do with the epic Helen or the Illiad, and Oddessey which could cause the movie to fall flat on its face for lack of any real connection to the actual story.  The very worst part to me is the mishandling and misrepresentaion of Achilles and the way he lived, fought, and died.  The portrayed rape of Helen by Agamemnon was a serious deviation from the epic poetry and other than groos and unnecessary sensationalizing of a terrible event which is entirely missing from the literature.  Helen did accompany Menelaus back to Sparta and they seem to have lived out their lives there.  I would recommend this movie for entertainment purposes only with the hope that it might stimulate others into reading Homer, about Crete, About Mycenae, and about Greek in particular.  I will not criticize tha actors in this drama although I think they were underprepared for the role but did the best they could with what they had been given.  If it stimulates the viewer's interest into exploring the other fine books and DVD's that are currently coming out, the movie will have far exceeded its potential.  I would strongly recommend Homer's Illiad/Oddessey, Paul Cartledge's The Spartans, Anything by Bettand Hughes, a historian extrordinaire and a story teller of the very highest quality.  Her books and DVD's will touch you heart and soul.  In addition, Tom Holland's Persion Fire is an exceptional read which literally makes history come alive as does Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire which is a historical narrative of the Battle for the Gates of Thermoplyae.  Having experienced the blood, sweat, tears, fear, and terror of hand to hand combat, I can attest the his book will make you feel like you were there and you understood, and will understand, why men can dedicate themselves to a country and a cause much bigger than themselves.  All soldiers fear being hurt or killed on a humbug (events bordering on incompentence) but are prepared to die honorably if the cause is just.  His book is the closest you will ever come to sharing the frontline without actually getting out there and doing it.  Kudos to him.  I love the book.",1148688000,8,2305,4.8295165394402035

this movie is not a real theatrical film. character and scene design are as good as an excellent TV production. Special effects are very good but not as good as a real theatrical film, a good theatrical film I mean otherwise we see lots of cheap movies these days in Cinemas! BUT... the story and actings are masterpiese! very strong adaptation of Homer's book. If you've never ridden that book, this movie would got you surprized cause of it's unusual and brilliant story. there is no hero here. and no hero wins! Agamemnon was killed by his wife after raping Helen! Achilis was killed by paris, paris was killed by agamemnon, and at last, Helen came to her Husband! story is really different than a hollywoodic cheap movies like ""TROY""

in movies like ""TROY"" they attempt to fool people with brilliant special effects and CGs and the story in such movie usually a loose adaptation of originals! in that movie, they've shown like if stealing some other guys wife cause of love is right, and worse is, that criminal survives at the end and the owner of right, dies! and that shameless thieve becomes a Hero! of course in front of such movies, I rate this one with all of it's problems as 5 star!

Thats not the point of any movie so what makes you think that it could possibly be the point in this particular one. Helen of Troy (2003) is a great movie because of it's extremely good way of teaching a little history without being boring. And then again... Helen of Troy is kinda like Romeo & Juliet. A love story but still a war story. Next time you review a movie remember movies like Helen of Troy and Romeo & Juliet doesen't need an epic war scene.,1104364800,3,549,4.140186915887851

I just can't figure what about her is so beautiful as to warrant the launching of one ship...let alone a thousand.

1521047,3,B00005JMH8,"Helen of Troy is a movie that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Homer's story of the Trojan War to have been.  The movie does not faithfully follow the original, rather it is INSPIRED by Homer's Iliad, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the original story. One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied the Iliad, it is common knowledge that the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...

From this very long list there are several important alteration such as when Achilles fought and killed Hector following Patroklos' (Achilles' close friend's) death at the hands of the Trojan prince.  Patroklos is nowhere to be seen in the movie!!!  Achilles himself is played by an actor who is totally bold (???), when according to the Iliad he should be blond, not to mention that he has the appearance of a northern barbarian (???) rather than that of a Greek hero.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is the Iliad in question and not some modern twentieth century novel.

In addition, all throughout the film one gets the feeling, on and off, that they are watching an extended episode of Xena as a result of the Xena-style setting, action and at times even Xena-style dialogues.

Moreover, ALL the actors after 10 YEARS of WAR had not changed one bit from the opening scenes.  They looked EXACTLY as they did at the beginning of the film!

Furthermore, the deaths of Paris and Hector as well as the fall of Troy instead of being played out in full, are crammed together in a few minutes at the end.

Lastly, special emphasis must be made on the point that the Trojans are Greeks too, with the same language, the same gods, the same names etc, which is another thing that the movie does not stress enough, leaving relations between the combatants vague/open to any theory.

Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read the Iliad) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually did occur according to Homer.  Consequently, due to the distortion of Homer's work, the movie poses a very serious danger of producing armies of misinformed people who think they know Homer when they really do not.  That is NOT good!

On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the costumes are excellent, and the special effects are very good!  The acting, however, is average.  John Rhys-Davies, and the rest of the actors have done a fair job of providing an entertaining film.  The actors playing Menelaus and Achilles could not have been more off.  Helen (Sienna Guillory) was very good looking and had her share of ""light"", nude scenes, but acting is not her really strong point...

Hopefully, more movies will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.",1102896000,,3034,4.70132325141777

Sienna Guillory is definitely not the most beautiful woman on the earth. Marsden's Paris is dull, Hector almost non existent and Achilles is so fat he can hardly move (should that be a half god?).

The real jewel of the film (which is disgracefully not enough to save the day) is Rufus Sewell as King Agamemenon. His acting is brilliant and touching; the sacrifice Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia is a masperpiece  of acting.

1521081,4,B00005JMH8,"After seeing the movie TROY - which disappointed my highly - I rented this DVD from my neighbourhood video store not expecting much.  I was in for a surprise!  I spent the next three hours glued to my TV screen and enjoyed it so much I ended up buying the film to add to my growing DVD collection.

  As far as TV movies go, this one is above average.  One must remember this film was made for TV.  If they don't think the special effects were much, than the money that went in to the costumes, sets and props tells you how original the producers and the director wanted them to be.  The documentary on the making of the production tells you that much.

  Those who are familiar with Homer's classic poem will have their own idea of how the Iliad should be told.  We are informed at the beginning of the film, by Menelaus himself, that this is the real story.  What he himself saw, not Homer.  You then know that you are in for a fresh version.  What I found was most of the important parts of the original story with minor additions or changes that had no negative effect.

  Sienna Guillory was given a challenge in playing the part of Helen.  It is no easy task as everyone has their own idea of what Helen should look like or behave.  Here she played an adolescent Helen as well as a older, wiser one.  For a 25 year old woman to try to come across convincingly as a 15 year old still innocent to the world is no easy task.  She also convinced me by playing a Helen who felt she was the responsiblity for the death and destruction around her when it was actually Agamemnon's greed, Priam's poor judgement and Paris' selfishness.

  The film also took Homer's two of Homer's romantic heroes and exposed them for the people their probably really would have been.  Rufus Sewell (an actor who I've been keeping an eye on) was excellent in portraying Agamemnon as a cruel, arrogant king who coveted the wealth of Troy and Menelaus' wife.  Joe Montana surprised me in his performance as Achilles.  What lines he had he delivered well, and his intensity convinced me that Achilles wasn't a good guy.  Instead he was vainglorious and lusted for the violence of battle.  Those who complained about him being bald should try to imagine Montana in a blonde wig like the one Brad Pitt wore.  Just doesn't fit, does it.

  As for the true heroes, Matthew Marsden, though a pretty boy, held up his role as Paris very well.  I've always seen Paris as a flawed hero, his love for Helen meaning more to him than the safety of the city and people of Troy.  He truly dies a heroes death at the hands of Agamemnon.  Menelaus is another flawed hero.  A man who, at the willing of the gods, falls in love with Helen and wins her as his trophy wife, only to lose her.  James Callis made me sympathise with Menelaus, his strong but sensitive portrayal of the Spartan king convincing me that in the end Helen was returned to a husband who would no longer take her for granted.  By the way, Menelaus and Helen went on to have their own adventures in Egypt while on their return to Sparta, and had three sons and a daughter named Hermione.

  As for the true hero, Daniel Lapaine is truly a courageous Hector.  John Rhys-Davies easily fills the shoes of the wise but flawed King Priam, Katie Blake impressed me with her sympathetic portrayal of the vengeful Queen Clytemnestra, and Emilia Fox as Cassandra, cursed by Apollo to always tell the truth but never be believed, was very believable.  A talent she inherieted from her father Edward Fox, no doubt.  The rest of the cast was suberb.

1521083,4,B00005JMH8,"I'm always on the lookout for DVDs that I could use for my comparative literature classes. HELEN of TROY and TROY both have their high points and low points. A good point of HELEN is that it shows Hera, Athena and Aphrodite making Paris judge who among them is the fairest goddess; a bad point is that Achilles' weak heel is never given a deeper discussion (""Why is that his kryptonite?"" non-mythophiles would wonder). A good point of TROY is that Achilles' mother Thetis is given a spotlight (albeit briefly), thus shedding a light that alludes to his weak heel; a bad point is that he, not the wily Oddyseus, was given credit for the building of the Trojan Horse. And wasn't he already dead when the Horse was dragged into Troy? And the war took more than a few weeks; it was ten years. The movie is just as destructive as Disney's HERCULES. Sure, no one has the copyright to these myths, but young viewers would get misled and, being of the movie generation, they have the tendency to prefer Hollywood to, say, Edith Hamilton. CLASH OF THE TITANS is, to my opinion, the best rendering of a Greek mythological hero, because the story is not alienated of the gods and no filmmaker has offered to surpass its success. HERCULES starring Lou Ferrigno has got to be the worst; it should never even have been put on betamax.

I would still like to see a film about the Trojan War that focuses on the gods themselves -- from the beauty contest on Mount Olympus to the Olympians disguising themselves as Greek and Trojan warriors to Athena's inspiring Oddyseus to come up with the Trojan Horse.

1521085,5,B00005JMH8,"This review is from the perspective of having seen the big bucks film ""Troy,"" starring Brad Pitt, and not having read Homer's ""Iliad"" itself.

The remarkably uneven film ""Troy"" left a lot to be desired for those of us who would rather enjoy a film with a strong story as opposed to great action and special effects.  While there's nothing necessarily wrong with these parts of this A&E production, the Pitt vehicle excels in those areas.  If you are a Pitt fan, or if you value a film based on how much action there is, then this is not for you.  You will enjoy ""Troy"" more than ""Helen of Troy.""

There are many similarities between the two productions, beyond that of using the same source material.  Each of them chose to demythologize the story, removing Homer's use of the gods as active characters in the story.  Each also continues the long show business tradition of presenting classical characters as if they all had British accents.  Each retains the Greek tragedy aspect of the story, without tacking on a happy ending of some sort.

From there, however, the productions diverge noticeably.  The character of Achilles, played with depth by Pitt in the theatrical film, is here more akin to what I understand is the way Homer originally presented him:  A bloodthirsty, single-minded gloryhound warmonger, Pitt's version of Achilles was as a more complex and conflicted individual who was central to that film's storyline.  In ""Helen of Troy"" he is a secondary character played by a bald actor who will never be accused of looking nearly as attractive as Pitt.

But that suits the story, which actually revolves around the title character, the Aegean kings who have sworn to defend King Menelaeus's right to her, and Prince Paris and the royal family of Troy, who unwisely welcomed Helen into their midst.

In this production Agamemnon and his brother are much younger, more vital men, and Achilles has no quarrel with them as he did in the Pitt vehicle.  Also Paris is not presented as a wimpy loser as he was when Orlando Bloom portrayed him in the theatrical film, but rather as valiant but less gifted warrior who is betrayed.  He even has a scene with Helen's husband wherein we see that both characters have far more depth than the short shrift given them in the Pitt vehicle.

This production, overall, is for those who became interested in this ancient tale because of the Pitt vehicle, or are just keen to know more about the legends of Achilles' heel, the Trojan horse, and Helen of Troy, the face that launched a thousand ships.

And by the way, the role of Helen here is a thousand times more interesting than portrayed by Diane Kruger in the Pitt vehicle.  There is also some welcome backstory that helps us understand why she finds her husband so distasteful, and a more complete ending to the tale.  That's ultimately why I find this version so satisfying:  There is much more story here, except as relates to the character of Achilles, who got so much screen time in the Pitt vehicle.  This story makes more sense, is generally better acted all the way around, and, unless your tastes run solely to nonstop battle scenes, does not drag at all for its three-hour length.  Good job.",1095897600,3,3204,4.712746858168761
1521086,3,B00005JMH8,"Although it lacks the grandeur, spectacle and cinematic composition of Wolfgang Peterson's film version, ""Helen of Troy"" does a credible and interesting job of presenting Homer's The Iliad. With some stunning performances by Rufus Sewell (""Dark City""), Stellan Skarsgard (""The Exorcist-The Beginning)and John Rhys Davies (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"")and a number of nice action pieces, ""Helen of Troy"" does simplify the tale quite a bit but also manages to get in some dramatic and powerful moments as well.

The picture quality is good with solid colors and blacks but the overall feel of the film lacks the epic scope and digitally enhanced battle sequences that made Petersen's film so memorable.

The DVD also includes a 20 minute featurette on the making of the film.

1521159,4,B00005JMH8,"The movie Helen of Troy produced by Ronnie Kern was reviewed by Jesy Javier, a fourth year student of Assumption Antipolo on August 01, 2004. Helen of Troy was released in the year 2003 and the movie was about 175 minutes (almost 3 hours). The movie has a bit of drama, romance and a lot of action.
Helen of Troy was directed by John Kent Harrison. The major characters were Helen, Paris, and Agamemnon which portrayed by Sienna Gullory (Helen), Matthew Marshden (Paris), and Rufus Sewell (Agamemnon). The plot of the movie started in Troy where in Queen Hecuba gave birth to her son, Paris. Because of Cassandra's vision, sister of Paris, Paris was said to be killed for he will be the reason of Troy's fall. But Paris was not killed; he was only left in Mt. Ida. When he grew up, he encountered the three goddesses who started the war between Sparta and Troy. When Paris went to Sparta to deliver his father's orders to Menelaus, King of Sparta, he saw the beautiful wife of the king. Paris and Helen escaped from Sparta and went back to Troy. Rage and greed filled the hearts of the brothers Menelaus and Agamemnon so they went to Troy for war. Many innocent lives were taken. The war lasted for 10 years. The movie focused on the fairness of life to each individual and the love and loyalty for their own country.
The actors and actresses delivered their role very well. The only confusing part was the different characteristics of the characters in the movie and in the text. The character of Helen is very sympathetic in terms of the different challenges she went through in the film. It was her who I pitied the most. The acting of the actors and actresses gave a big impact on the film. They made the movie interesting for all the people of different ages. Some of the scenes in the movie were not portrayed very well. A good example for this is when Helen jumped into the sea and swim towards Paris' ship. She was over reacting. She showed a little bit of irony which I didn't like because it's a waste of time. Agamemnon was the best among the characters because he really showed the fierceness of his role. The characters can be nominated for the Oscars, especially Rufus Sewell who portrayed Agamemnon.
The very important aspect of making a film is to look for or make an appropriate sound or music for the scenes of the movie. It is important because it helps the movie to be realistic and it gives life to the movie. Lighting and cinematography is also part of the important aspects. These technical aspects are used to make the movie interesting in a sense of making the audience feel the essence of each scene in the movie. It gives effects that can captivate the audience's being.
Based on the movie, the Trojan War started because of the judgment of Paris among the three goddesses. It was also the same with the text; however the text is more accurate than the film because it is more detailed. The scenes in the movie were not complicated, and the scenes were not totally revised.
The only difference between the movie and the text is how each character delivered their roles. The movie and the text have the same conflicts but some of the scenes in the text were not shown in the movie maybe because it would make the movie not serious because of the gods. Although the movie is not complete as the text, it is still good to watch it.  The movie showed incredible fighting scenes and can make you understand the story more.",1091664000,,3444,4.5104
1521160,3,B00005JMH8,"The first impression you get watching this movie is ""uggh! Great story but I wish I were watching a theatrical release of a tale as great as this"". Though good by television's standard, it looks somewhat cheesy and thrown together. With that said however I soon found myself getting immersed in the movie and not so distracted by it's failings. The backstory on Paris and Helen, though not always accurate was developed nicely and kept my interest. In my eyes this was crucial and a good decision on the part of the producers. I agree with several that Helen could've been more beautiful (I was actually irked by the mediocre actress in the beginning). As the film moved forward however she grew on me. She seemed to have a knack for exhibiting the nuances of her character with a good combination of depth, strength, sensuality and innocence. Paris and the other characters were midland to good but the actor that portrayed Agememnon was pretty outstanding. I'm not crazy about the way that his character was written but the portrayal by Rufus Sewell was moving. Achilles however was a JOKE... he came off like an obnoxius WWF wrestler or some moron from a Mad Max sequel. My biggest issue with the movie creatively was the last half hour. I'll admit that the climax was satisfying but overall it cheapened the legend. It was as if the writers went into overdrive (bringing the film to a level of the absurd) in order to close it.

 Bottom line: There were a great many cinematic liberties taken with the nature and purpose of several characters. On its own, this movie was still quite entertaining and to me that's what is most important.",1091404800,,1640,4.690972222222222
1521161,4,B00005JMH8,"I just finished watching TROY (with Brad Pitt)and I was greatly disappointed. At least Helen of Troy sticks to the story - for the most part. In the movie TROY, Menelaus is killed by Hector and Achilles & Agamemnon both die inside Troy during the sacking. In Helen of Troy there aren't any huge mistakes - at least not on the scale of TROY. Why oh why can't the directors just stick to the story?????",1088553600,3,400,4.346666666666667
1521162,5,B00005JMH8,"This was made for TV, but is significantly better than the box office movie Troy.
First the negatives...Achilles is terrible as a bald headed he-man, Hector comes accross as a wimp, Menelaus is way too docile as the king of the warrior Spartans and is constantly abused by Agammemnon, Helen is not strikingly beautiful, Agammemnon seems too young, Odysseus has a tiny role and there is no Ajax.
As for the positives...there is extensive character development that explains the relationships between the characters, i.e. Helen was the sister of Agammemnon's wife.  The scene when Agammemnon crosses the line and makes the choice to kill his own daughter is powerful.  They stick to the original story line for a significant portion of the movie.
Overall, it's a great movie.  Well worth spending an evening, or a weekend if you combine it with the made for TV movie The Odyssey with Armand Assante.  One minor point...although made for TV, Helen seems to have an affinity for tissue paper clothing.",1087776000,4,997,4.952095808383233
1521163,4,B00005JMH8,"It was interesting to read all the scathing reviews that criticised this movie because it was not entirely faithful to the Iliad. Well, having seen Troy (which many were eagerly awaiting as a ""better"" version), I have to say Helen Of Troy is much closer to Homer's classic than ""Troy"".  Despite the big budget and special effects, Troy is a travesty! At least the mythological background is included in this movie (Helen of Troy), as is the correct ending showing Helen returning to her husband (in Troy, Menelaus is old and ugly, and killed off early in the movie, leaving Paris and Helen to elope at the end of the movie!!).
In the Iliad, Helen returns willingly to her husband and lives happily ever after - but this movie has a creative take on this, showing Helen returning to him, but telling him she can never love him.  Rufus Sewell was superb as Agammemnon - much better than the portrayal of the same in ""Troy"", and all in all there was a lot more depth and exploration of the characters in this movie than in ""Troy"".  I thought the casting was quite good (as opposed to Troy....Brad Pitt was so badly mis-cast as Achilles). I thought the portrayal of the love-struck Menelaus, who is willing to take Helen back despite everything, was good. Achilles was well cast, and truer to the Iliad than the shocking casting of Brad Pitt in the role. Overall a very enjoyable interpretation of the Iliad, and a thousand times better than ""Troy"".",1085270400,6,1445,4.614785992217898
1521164,4,B00005JMH8,"Like most movies adapted from books or stories, film makers will take some liberties with the storyline and place their personal marks. As long as there is the attempt to stay true to the tone of the original work, you can still carry the story as it was intended to be told.

That being said, I think that this film was a very good depiction of the Trojan war.  The director chose to center the theme around Helen and her effect on the men in this film.  Her character is meant to be innocent and her spirit a free one. It is this quality that makes her unknowlingly so attractve.  Helen slowly begins to realise she is the cause of many troubles including her own unhappiness and soon learns the difference betwen lust and love.  This is why she runs away with Paris to Troy, contrary to the notion that she was stolen.

The Greeks have different ideas.  Their prize possession was taken from them by their most hated enemy and what better catalyst to serve as Agamemnon's reason for war on Troy.  Paris came to Sparta to talk peace, a result power hungry Amagemnon had no interest in.  His desire for Troy is more than his desire for Helen.  In this battle between lust and love, lust wins and brings havoc on all.  The Gods and Goddesses are lauging again at their fateful mischief despite Cassandra's visions of warning.

The production sets were pretty good, but the armor and battle sequences are not quite as impressive as we've seen in other movies.  This is supposed to be the greatest battle of all time, yet not much emphasis is placed on the battle at all.

The acting, on the other hand, was very well done.  There are lots of characters and names thrown around, familial relations here and there.  It can get confusing if you're not familiar with the Iliad. Each character's personal agenda tied nicely into the storyline leading to the war on Troy.  Rufus Sewell made a marvellous Amagemnon.

I will admit Helen should have been played by someone with stunning beauty.  Sienna Guillory is pretty but a bit on the thin side and doesn't have that face that would launch a thousand ships.  She does, however, capture Helen's innocence and sensual spirit.

On the whole a good story telling movie and a must-see before watching the Brad Pitt version of Troy to get a clear background behind this great war.",1084579200,3,2318,4.5641646489104115

1521167,1,B00005JMH8,"I cannot for the life of me understand why people enjoyed this movie. For someone who has studied Greek myth for nearly 20 years, it is pretty hard to please me, but this was just horrible in every way. To the reviewer who asked how we know what happened: because the myths are written a particular way; the creative license taken here is far too great.

Theseus and Polydeukes did not kill each other, Paris and Hektor did not fight one another, Akhilleus was not a third-rate wrestler who murdered Hektor without hand-to-hand combat. The producers obviously made this movie to villainize the Greeks and portray the Trojans as pure and innocent people. The license taken with  Agamemnon was acceptable due to his character in myth *and Rufus Sewell did an excellent job, and apart from Rhy-Davies (who is always good) as Priam, the only decent actor in the picture* Helen was ridiculously miscast, as was Paris, Menalaos, Akhilleus, and virtually every other character.

If a director is going to make a historical, even legendary, picture, he has a responsiblity to stay somewhat true to the story. Gladiator took a great deal of license, but it did not center on a historical character or on traditional characters that have travelled down through the centuries in a way that they seem real to the modern mind. It is forgivable in Gladiator's case, not so in this film's. A great disappointment and I can only say I hope the writers and producers of this film are reprimanded greatly for their vast mistakes.",1082419200,31,1511,4.803846153846154
1521168,2,B00005JMH8,"The biggest problem with this movie is its budget. You cannot make an epic without spending a lot of money, and this suffers greatly from bad sets and bad costumes.
Script problems: the screenwriters had obviously down their research but made bad choices about what to include on-screen. So, they did for example include the Theseus/Helen story (which is in the myth) but they didn't mention Andromache. I'm sure if Helen lived in Troy for 10 years she would meet Andromache. And the nudity was unnecessary and it wasn't in the myth. I think they added that to get viewers. They also altered Hector's personality and made Paris more noble than he is (although Paris did fight in the games before becoming the prince, he did not fight Hector, he fought another of Priam's sons--this son whose name I've forgotten marries Helen after Paris dies by the way--which they also didn't include).
This movie has some of the worst fight scenes I've ever scene. Blurring will not take away from the fact that the actors have obviously not trained for this and the weapons look very fake. Achilles was very badly cast. Menelaus' character was a character the writers had obviously not decided on. It was incredibly sketchy and inconsistent.
Overall, I'd say don't bother buying this. There are far too many problems with it to be a good movie. Troy (2004) will be much better than this. Just go watch that instead.",1081987200,4,1402,4.773662551440329

Most of the rest of the performances are fine, especially Rufus Sewell.  I did take issue with having the bald Joe Montana portray Achilles--Achilles shouldn't be portrayed as an one dimensional Bruce Willis clone.  Hopefully, Brad Pitt will come closer to the mark in Warner Bros.' TROY.  It will be interesting to see if Patrocles' relationship with Achilles is explored in any detail.  The USA miniseries is good enough to hold my interest until TROY is released in 2004.  By the way, those who liked the miniseries should check out the coming DVD of Robert Wise's 1956 version of HELEN OF TROY.",1074729600,7,851,5.071942446043166
1521213,1,B00005JMH8,"I have to admit, I gave up on this movie about halfway through. I love Greek mythology and history, particularly the story of the Trojan war and the legendary beauty of Helen of Troy, but this made for TV movie was really quite awful.
While the sets, costumes and special effects were interesting and some of the casting was promising (notably Priam and Agamemnon), there was very little character development of the main characters and the pace was slow and plodding.
The acress playing Helen was particularly bad. Her characterization consisted of stomping around acting like a spoiled child. On a couple of occasions she was referred to as a child which was a real problem for me as she looked like she was around 35.  My other major problem about this movie is that Helen is supposed to be amazingly beautiful - the daughter of a god - and she was only so-so looking in my opinion. Now I know that beauty is extremely subjective, but I think many would agree that there are many more women in the world that have beauty and acting skills. This was a particularly poor piece of casting.
I am not usually one to give up on a movie halfway through, but this was just too much to take.  If you are interested in the story of the Trojan war, I recommend going back to the source and reading Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. For a good adaptation, I recommend reading Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Firebrand"" which is a retelling of the story from Kassandra's point of view. Hopefully the big screen adaptation due this summer will be more interesting.",1074470400,41,1543,4.586956521739131
1521214,3,B00005JMH8,"Homer's ""Iliad"" is perhaps the most famous piece of epic poetry in the world, chronicling the ten year siege of Troy and the actions taken by the brothers Menelaus and Agamemnon to win back Menelaus' wife Helen, stolen from her home by Paris, a prince of Troy.
In recreating the tale, the people at Hallmark have taken some liberties in presenting the story, some small and understandable, some large and baffling. Basically, if you're hoping for a loyal representation to Homer's text, this is not the movie to watch: despite the four hour running time a lot of material is omitted, the personalities of some characters are utterly changed, and fabricated events seem to have no real importance.
The story actually begins with Paris - his birth and his abandonment, leading up to the famous choice between the three goddesses: with Aphrodite promising the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, and to his reinstating as prince in Troy. In fact, he is given so much attention, that its a little confusing when his character drops somewhat from the action later on. Helen at this time is a reasonably young child (at least that's what everyone around her says - she looks pretty old to me), and is kidnapped by King Theseus, which eventually leads to his and her brother's death. Deemed cursed by her father, she is offered to the kings of neighbouring lands. Through a game of chance, she is given to Menelaus, though the timing could not be worse: soon after arrives a delegation from Troy, bearing with them Prince Paris...
In recreating the citadel of Troy and the landscapes of Greece, the film-makers triumph wonderfully: most of the special effects are just as good as one would expect on the big screen, and the scale of the movie is as huge as one would expect. Nifty camera movements, such as the vertical circling of the Trojan Horse to present its collosal size, are amazing, as are the shots of the armies and fleets moving toward Troy.
Characterisation suffers a bit, however. Out of everyone, Agamemnon goes from what could potentially be the most sympathetic hero out of everyone, to a mere brute. Through him, the siege does not become a war of pride to retrieve Helen, but to conquer for power and spoils. I love Rufus Sewell, and his grief in sacrificing his daughter is portrayed excellently by the actor (he admits to Helen that she and the city are not worth what he had to do), but the rape of Helen in front of the burning city took things a little too far. Scholars will be disguisted.
Paris also, goes from a rather cowardly youth, to every girl's dream: loving, romantic, protective of Helen, and so on. Achilles, Odysseus and Hector's roles are too short to be interesting. Menelaus is perhaps a bit young, rather than an imposing king in his own right, but his character is an intriging one, who is perhaps genuinely in love with Helen, but unable to show it. Two excellently portrayed characters are King Priam (John Rhys-Davis - could you expect anything less from him?) and Cassandra (who ""Pride and Prejudice"" fans will recognise as Georgiana) - her hysteria and terror are perfectly portrayed, as are her horrific visions.
But as the title suggests, it is Helen that the movie centres on, and I actually thought a rather good attempt was made to untangle her motivations and character. Tired of being a trophy bride, she seeks out true love, she tries to put an end to the war, she suffers guilt at the deaths of those around her, and seems reasonably perseptive. However, a more accomplished actress was needed to pull off this difficult role, something that new-comer Sienna Guillroy just can't do. Instead the director takes every oppurtunity he can to show off her bare bottom, even if its to the extreme of parading naked in front of an entire room full of soldiers.
It almost comes across as a preview to Wolfgang Peterson's epic movie ""Troy"", and so it would have been nice to have included some of the more mystical aspects of the god's involvement in the war, as ""Troy"" is also apparently stripped of their presence. All in all, a good production, but I have no wish to see it a second time.",1074038400,9,4142,4.683127572016461

It lost the other 4 stars for the story, which by the end of the movie had me shaking my head in disgust.
I'm not going to go into detail about the inaccuracies because that would far exceed the 1000 word limit, so I will simply say that if you have ever read the Iliad or for that matter know anything about the Trojan war don't watch this movie, also note that at this point if you're asking yourself: ""What the heck is the Iliad?"" than don't bother reading the rest of this review and enjoy the movie.
There were 3 main parts of the story that bothered me the most:
- the first was the over emphasis on Paris and Helen's love affair. The timeline is all out of sync. The fact is that at the time of the fall of Troy Paris was long dead and Helen was already re-married to Deiphobus and Odysseus and Menelaus killed him, Helen then went willingly back to Sparta.
- the second point were the deaths of Hector, Achilles, and Paris all of which were done wrong
- the last point is the character assassination of Agamemnon, they turned him into this typical Hollywood bad guy which is nothing like the character portrayed in the Iliad, then they have him kill Paris and in the end rape Helen, two scenes that almost made me turn off the TV.
I would write more but I'm to upset at wasting 4 hours of my life on this movie. I am looking forward to the theatrical release of Troy next year and I have full confidence in Wolfgang Petersen to do honour to the legend of the Trojan War.",1072224000,16,1695,4.25077399380805

From the Vin Diesel-style, abrupt, one-sided, acting of Achilles to the meaningless and ridiculous twists to the original story, this movie manages the difficult task of turning the Greek masterpiece into a ridiculous piece of junk.

Lots of people say he was wimpy, but he was actually the coolest person in the movie (But that's just my opinion and the opinion of every straight girl I know).

The many differences between the book and movie made the movie Troy of Helen to be somewhat boring. In the beginning the movie did not catch my attention unlike the story. The story catches your attention and gets right to the point. The movie focused on the scenery at first more than the characters or plot.  When I expected Helen to come out, I thought you would be a gorgeous young lady like what the book described her as. Helen in the movie was plain looking and I don't understand why anyone would fight over her. The relationship between Paris and Helen was corny and fake in the movie. Paris's acting skills weren't true to the character in the book. The book describes Paris ""the Trojan prince whose abduction of Helen was the cause of the Trojan War"" the movie made Helen seem like the war was ALL her fault.  A scene that I found confusing was when Hector was being killed and King Priam just stood there with his wife watching. In the book it seemed to be that King Priam really cared about his son he went to Achilles house where he put himself in danger just to ask for son's body.  I felt like the movie wasn't totally true to the story but then again what movie is true to its original story?",1069200000,,1355,4.28125

See now what i obviously did was read the book first, so the movie was completely different. The story was different in many ways, for example the main thing that confused me was the fact that in the book when Hector was killed they were alone and the Hector told Achilles to not dishonor his body, and then after-wards Achilles dragged the body all through Troy which was when King Priam and his wife nearly went crazy. Then King Priam went to Achilles and asked frothe body of Hector. But in the movie Hector and Achilles was not alone in fact he was killed in front of everyone. Then Hector didn't even have a chance to ask Achilles to return the body to troy and to not dishonor it. After all that King Priam did not even ask for the body back. Helen then went to Agamemnon and tried to serender, give her self up to stop the war and to save the life of her ture love, Parris. It did not work.
  This movie made it seem like Parris was the main character and it didn't seem like the death of Hector was a problem at all. The acting of Cassandra was done well. Helen was nto pretty enough to launch 1,000 ships, Parris looked alittle weak for his role of being one to be powerful.

Nonetheless, I highly recommend this movie because (despite the ending which was obviously meant to appeal to our own, modern age) Helen of Troy captures the Greek concept of love and lust better than I have yet seen done in any other production.
The Greeks did not think that sexual passion was a harmless passtime.  To them sexual passion was a destructive natural force that, if indulged in to excess, could destroy worlds.  In this case, it destroyed Troy and all but destroyed Mycenea.
And that is why all feel dishonored in the end; for the ability to control one's appetite is the sign of a truly virtuous man--and none of the men in this movie can be so described.",1067644800,3,926,4.668711656441718

It was annoying to watch a few hundred FAKE ships sailing the seas. cassandra was annoying as well. the story wasn't really that great either. the guy played agamemnon fit the role and john rhy-davies played a good King Priam (it was nice to see him as someone rather that Gimli from LOTR).

What a great and exciting movie - keep more like this coming!",1066953600,,174,4.46875
1521275,3,B00005JMH8,"I thought this movie could have been better.  I understand that Hollywood is going to take a few licenses with certain movies in order to make them appeal to all genders and age groups, but I don't think a story as old as the Iliad needs any tampering.  First, let me outline the good points of the movie.  The actors protraying Cassandra and Agamemmon put in incredible performances, I believe, although Agamemmon was made far more bloodthirsty and ruthless then he should have been.  I think it was especially cheesy to have a little child protray his doomed daughter, Iphgenia, instead of an older girl, like in the Iliad.  His daughter was brought to the altar on the premise of marrying Achilles, only to be sacrificed.  In this movie, the incredible young age of the girl only serves one purpose and that is to create a loathing for Agamemmon in the viewer.  I for one do not like being manipulated in my emotions in this way.  I thought the characters of Helen and Paris were also incredibly stupid.  Both actors tried entirely too hard and what it came off as was a second rate Romeo and Juliet story.  I found the actress who played Helen (fantastic body aside) to be quite unattractive myself, certainly not suitable to portray a woman thought to be the most beautiful in the world.  Paris was the worst character in the movie.  An arrogant, self-centered coward in the Iliad, he is instead made out to be this great and honorable man in the movie.  It was he (along with Aphrodite's assistance) that cheated in the battle against Meneleus.  Not to mention I found the scene where he defeated Hector in the games to be completely monoric, as Hector was supposed to be the greatest warrior of his age.  It certainly diminished his later battle against Achilles.  Oh, big deal.  Achilles killed Hector.  Hell, Paris beat him earlier in the movie.  Achilles was another character that was done horribly.  Achilles fought for the glory of battle, but he wasn't evil and shifty.  He dragged Hector's corpse as revenge for Hector killing his friend, Patroclus, not because he was ruthless and cruel.  Also, Achilles death at the hands of Paris was another travesty.  Paris murdered Achilles from afar, like a coward, in the story, unlike the semi-heroic fashion he dispatched Achilles in the movie.  Moving back to Helen again, the only reason she ever loved Paris was because Aphrodite forced her to.  Meneleus was a good husband and a good king.  He did not abuse Helen in any way and SHE chose HIM as her husband, after her father made all of the kings swear an oath that none would seek revenge against the man who won her hand.  All in all, this movie would have been a truly great film, if the Iliad had never existed at all, but because of the great differences between the film and the story (the changes make the film almost completely different then the story) this movie falls well below expectations.  If you are looking for a truly great epic film to watch, I suggest Merlin, Braveheart, or Gladiator.  Do NOT watch this film if you have read, and enjoy, the Iliad, because you will not be pleased.",1065657600,8,3115,4.633211678832117
1521276,1,B00005JMH8,"Having first been so excited by the mini-series of The Odyssey I cannot believe that Hollywood has dropped back into the comic '50's versions of historical classics! Having endured the full two discs I feel totally depressed. What's wrong with it? Everything almost!!. Anyone who has any acquaintance with the original tale should be out torching this version. Others have pointed out the obvious distortions of the facts, but even given that it should have looked good! It ain't, it's as cheesey and less interesting to look at than Xenia. Visually it is disgraceful - rayon ribbons on tunics, obvious sewing machine lines, and colors that should earn the designer a B Minus for knowledge. Doesn't the costume designer know that emerald greens and blue purples didn't exist before the 1860's? And the sets are just as poor. Terrible CGI (those thousand boats!!) and not one iota of a sense of a real and vivid city. There appeared to be only one staircase in Troy and everyone, but everyone ran up and down it. Hollywood did it better with the silly version with Rossana Podesta as Helen in the '50's. The only saving grace was the actress playing Cassandra - she, at least had a sense of the drama she was in and convinced as one who could see and dreaded the future. The acting was fairly poor - but who could expect more from this travesty of a script - and all I can say (being in shock as I am) is that Helen's nipples looked quite tempting in her one good costume of chiffon. I might have accepted this if it was a dream-sequence from The Young and the Restless, but for serious viewing this is a crock. Let us all go on our knees and pray that the Wolfgang Peterson movie of ""Troy"" will give us the sense of that fabulous city Homer sings of.",1065657600,8,1750,4.5062893081761
1521277,5,B00005JMH8,"As there are few things more distasteful than a badly-done rendition of an epic story, this effort at re-creating the Homeric world is very refreshing and engrossing.  The production value of this ambitious venture is top-notch;  I can't think of why anyone who has ever read Homer would be disappointed with this DVD.
The novice might be inclined to believe that the film is taken straight from the ILIAD.  In fact, precious few scenes are actually in Homer's poem.  The majority of the action depicted happens either before or after the ILIAD.
The episode of Helen being abducted by Theseus is based on an obscure myth.  The major differences between the myth & the story in the DVD are (1):  Helen is just a child in the myth (as opposed to a young woman in the film).  (2):  In the myth, Theseus is not killed by Helen's brothers when they come to fetch her back.
Given the fact that Homer's poem is saturated with the interaction of gods & goddesses, it comes as a surprise that the roles of the gods are muted in this story.  Aside from the cameo of the 3 goddesses in the abbreviated JUDGMENT OF PARIS at the beginning of the tale, the entire Greek pantheon is basically left out of the remainder of the story.
The acting is quite good.  The men, for the most part, fit their roles as Greeks & Trojans.  Sienna Guillory plays a credible Helen & I thought she portrayed a believable young, innocent girl who gets in way over her head.  Obviously, no matter who they pick to play ""the most beautiful woman who ever lived,"" there will ALWAYS be some people who are unhappy w/the selection.  That  Guillory is in possession of acting skills is helpful;  hiring a supermodel who can't act would have been a complete disaster.
Making Paris into some sort of quasi-hero was exceptionally bold and radical.  It is something that would have been apt to strike the ancient Greeks as strange.  It was a clever bit how they re-arranged the infamous duel between Menelaous and Paris.
That said, what the makers of this film did was very Greek in its manner.  In Greek tragedies different characters are portrayed in a variety of ways, depending on the point that tradgedian was attempting to convey.  This was true even in different plays by the SAME author.
This DVD is HIGHLY recommended to anyone who has read Homer, wants to read Homer or is even slightly interested in the mythology of the ancient Greeks.  It blends some history and mythology (such as the reason that Troy was attacked) and does a balanced job of telling Homer's story.  This one is truly a classic, based on a classic.",1064275200,11,2586,4.59041394335512

1521309,1,B00005JMH8,"I guess it is enivitable that Hollywood would tell the story of Helen in the basest way possible.  The ""face that launced a thousand ships"" becomes instead merely another royal prostitute.
Perhaps that is why this Helen is not of surpassing beauty.  Such a woman would probably not bare it all as willingly as this actress.
As a fan of all things classical I was looking forward to this movie with great anticipation.  However, instead of the greatness of Homer there was only the distorted sleaze of modern film.
Don't get me wrong, Homer's Helen is highly sexual.  Somehow though, he manages to portray her with more appeal.  Her sexuallity almost seems worthy of admiration in Homer.  In this low-grade movie she seems little more than a silly slave girl.
My complaints don't stop at the portrayal of Helen however, instead of a grand duel between the mighty Hector and the invincible Achilles, the latter just throws a javelin in the former and pins him to a post.  Instead of dragging the corpse of Hector around the walls, this half-Achilles contents himself with dragging it around the campfire of his camp (Boring!!!). As a previously reviewer points out- everybody believes Kassandra's prophecies (destroying her mythological persona).  And where, Oh where, are the warring Gods!!
Why is it that Hollywood always takes a story that has lasted for centuries because of its appealing plot- and modifies it- thinking that this will make it ""more appealing"".  Instead of ""adaptations,"" they nearly always come up with ""distortions"".
Bottom line... don't waste your time, it will only diminish the greatness of this epic tale... I'm going back to my books...

The only one who was miscast was Achellies, but you would have to read The Illiad to know that. It would also give you a better handle on the difference between movie and story. Several editions are available here. If you are offended by any sort of nudity, this may not be movie for you, but this is greek myth, and the only full length shot is Helen from back.

1521311,4,B00005JMH8,"Ever since the Greek poet Homer first recorded the story, ""The Iliad"" has stood as one of the great pieces of Romantic Adventure.  While the USA TV mini-series, HELEN OF TROY, takes some unusual and interesting liberties with the classic story, it provides an entertaining version of the Greek myth.  Mainly told from Helen's point of view (with husband Menelaus providing the introduction and epilogue), HELEN OF TROY grabs your attention with some unique twists.  For starters, the relationship between brothers Menelaus (James Callis) and high-king Agammemnon (Rufus Sewell) is made into a very complex one, with the basically decent Menelaus being bullied and over-shadowed by his nasty and conniving brother.  Both of the major warriors of ""the Iliad,"" Achilles (the bald Joe Montana, who is NOT the the 49ers quarterback of the same name) and Hector (Daniel Lapaine) are given almost minor roles in the epic, with Achilles being no more than a burly brute and Hector as a less-than-superhuman warrior at best.  Many other major characters of the story are dropped completely.  For example, did anyone else wonder where Pollux's twin brother Castor disappeared to?.  Also, events are compressed to fit a reduced time-frame.
As for the acting, the range falls between very good to merely servicable. As the title role, Sienna Guillory is pretty enough, though not nearly ravishing enough to warrant launching ""a thousand ships."" Also, Guillory's Helen comes across as a bit of a pill with her character's tendency to whine.  Matthew Marsden fares better as a likable and sympathetic Paris, Helen's lover.  James Callis is solid in the somewhat thankless role of the cuckholded Menelaus.  Emelia Fox is perfect as the prophetess, Cassandra, who is doomed to foretell the truth...but is never  believed. John Rhys-Davies is powerful as King Priam of Troy, while Rufus Sewell turns in the top performance as the black-hearted Agamemmnon.
Overall, despite its weak points, HELEN OF TROY generates our interest over its 3 hour length and is definitely one of the better adaptations of Greek myth out there on film today. As a result, it's definitely one to recommend.",1061856000,4,2166,5.16
1521312,2,B00005JMH8,"As a drama about the love, lust, greed, ambition, revenge and the ferocity of war, ""Helen of Troy"" works well enough.  As an adaptation of the Trojan War, it fails miserably.  The reason: the script for ""Helen of Troy"" deviates far too much from ancient sources.  The mini-series starts off well enough -  Queen Hecuba of Troy gives birth to Alexandros.  His sister, Cassandra, who foresees the destruction of Troy if the newborn prince lives, begs her father to kill him.  King Priam trusts his daughter's ability to foretell the future and exposes the baby on a precipice.  A kindly shepherd chances upon the baby and adopts him.  Years later, Alexandros, named Paris by his adopted father, dreams of three goddesses who commands him to judge which one of them is loveliest.  Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, bribes him with an image of young Helen.  So far so good.  But bad signs start to appear.  We see Helen's brother, Pollux, but not his twin brother, Castor.  Hello?  Doesn't anybody know that Castor and Pollux are the twins that make up the Gemini constellation?  Pollux should also be more appropriately called Polydeuces - other annoying examples of Roman names being used abound, but I digress.  Prince Agamemnon of Mycenae visits Sparta and is granted the hand of King Tyndareus' eldest daughter, Clytemnestra.  He discovers too late that the younger daughter is much more alluring.  Shortly thereafter, the young Helen is kidnapped by Theseus, King of Athens.  This is accurate but what follows is again not.  Pollux rescues Helen but is killed in the process.  An angry Tyndareus, now deprived of his heir, renounces Helen to whoever will have her.  Odysseus proposes that the Greek kings draw lots - the lot falls to Menelaus.  What Menelaus does next is not adequately explained.  He is clearly besotted with Helen, yet the script writers will have him parade her naked amongst the Greek kings, a deplorable affront that pushes Helen into the arms of the newly arrived Trojan envoy, Paris, who has been reconciled with his parents.  Priam grants Helen sanctuary despite the objections of both Cassandra and Hector - apparently, in this version, Priam has only three children instead of fifty.  Agamemnon assembles the Greek army at Aulis, but unfavourable winds prevent the Greek ships from sailing.  Agamemnon is told that he must sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia, to obtain favourable winds - this he does.  Off the army goes to sack Troy.  Skip ten years forward, and we should expect to see a version of the Iliad.  Unfortunately, we do not.  What we have next is a complete travesty of the Iliad.  The central character, Achilles, is here twisted into something completely unrecognisable.  Achilles is here portrayed by a BALD actor - oh, come on - the real Achilles was no Vin Diesel wannabe.  In literature and in art, Achilles had always been portrayed as having long, flowing locks, a man who is almost beautiful but for his warrior's bearing.  Also, Achilles may be capable of incredibly bloodthirstiness, but he was also capable of supreme kindness.  But of course, the script writers would have none of that here.  In single combat, Achilles kills Hector by throwing his spear while Hector least expects it, a most cowardly act.  He then ties Hector's body to his chariot and drags it around the battlefield - we are not told why Hector would merit such desecration, except that the Greek army almost without exception are portrayed as scum.  We are further denied the sublime scene in the Iliad where Priam sneaks into the Greek camp and begs Achilles for Hector's body, softening the heart of the man who killed so many of his sons.  Instead, it is Helen who sneaks into Agamemnon's camp to redeem Hector's body but realises that Agamemnon is insane and will be satisfied with nothing less than her total humiliation and the utter annihilation of the Trojans.  She escapes back to Troy, aided by Paris, who dies in the hands of Agamemnon.  What happens next is the usual stuff - the Greeks pretend to sail for home, leaving behind a huge wooden horse, which the Trojans drag into their city.  Greeks hidden within then open the city gates, and the Greek army sack and burn Troy.  Then another ""innovation"" happens - Helen is raped by Agamemnon before the powerless gaze of Menelaus.  In the mini-series'  best scene, Clytemnestra arrives, sets her sister free, throws a net over an unsuspecting Agamemnon, and then hacks him to death to avenge Iphigenia.  The closing scene has Helen kneeling by the spot where Paris died, gently touching his blood stains, and then telling Menelaus that she could never love him but will follow wherever he leads.  The complete story of the Trojan War just cannot be adequately covered in three hours.  My dream version would be a season-long mini-series with 22 hour-long episodes which sticks to the ancient sources as closely as possible.  The ancient sources include: Cypria (the gods plot the beginnings of the war), Iphigenia at Aulis (the sacrifice of Iphigenia), Iliad (the wrath of Achilles), Aethiopis (the death of Memnon), Iliupersis (the destruction of Troy), Little Iliad and The Fall of Troy (the deaths of Penthesileia, Memnon, Achilles, Ajax and Paris), Nostoi (the return of the Greeks), and Agamemnon (the death of Agamemnon).

1521316,5,B00005JMH8,"Sure, lots of characters are missing -Castor, Patroclus, Deiphobus, Hermione, Laocoon, Diomedes- and the story gets somewhat refashioned to suit Hollywood tastes, but nonetheless it is told gloriously, and the locations, sets, costumes and special effects are nothing short of spectacular. WOW! This is how this stuff is meant to be shown! If you're a mythology freak like Myself Yourstruly, you're in for a guilty pleasure!
Sienna Gullory plays Helen as a pouting supermodel with a face that may launch a thousand surfboards at best, but Rufus Sewell ('Dangerous Beauty') makes a wickedly dashing Agamemnon and veteran John Rhys-Davies ('Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'The Lord of the Rings') is perfect as doomed King Pryam. Hecuba (Maryam D'Abo) looks great for a mother of fifty sons and twelve daughters! The rest of the cast I can't tell who they are or where I've seen them (Theseus was the KGB villain in 'Ronin' and Menelaus, the bumbling husband in 'Tracy Takes On'), but they all play their parts splendidly, particularly Cassandra and Clytemnestra...",1060905600,2,1058,5.156976744186046
1521317,5,B00005JMH8,"The screenplay is artfully woven and shaped from a variety of classical sources.  The part with Theseus, for the benefit of the Denton reviewer, was created by marrying the tale of Helen's kidnapping, which is described by Apollodorus, with the death of Theseus recounted in Plutarch.  I think it was included as a kind of counterpoint to her flight with Paris, making it clear that the emotional state of that flight was in no way comparable to a true kidnapping.  Obviously, Theseus does not come off as much of a hero, but the story arc is advanced.

Liberties are taken with the absence of characters.  Some are understandable.  Having both Castor and Pollux would have seemed a redundancy from the point of view of the story being told.  It is very much Helen's story.  So, Paris, Achilles, and all the other players have their traditional tales edited or sometimes even omitted for the sake of the continuity of Helen's story.  Achilles, most notably, is downplayed, but since the actor in the part is really a football player, that may have been a smart choice.  Agamemnon emerges as the real villain of the piece, though we are denied the mingling of his death with the fate of Cassandra.

Bottomline: What can be said about this production?  In the telling of a monumental story, necessary choices had to be made.  The resulting story that is told is compelling with just the right mix of epic and intimacy in its details.  Definitely worth watching!

By the way, I would remind the ""read-the-book-instead"" crowd that Homer's poetic Iliad ends long before the fall of Troy.  So, while they would appreciate more of the backstory involving the Greek gods and goddesses in the conflict, the dynamics of the Achilles-Hector rivalry, and the rift between Agamemnon and Achilles, the story--strictly ""by the book""--would not have a very satisfying ending.

And I would also advise any critics, who still cling to the notion that the theatrically released ""Troy"" was technically superior to this movie, that such a notion is sadly the only myth attached to that movie. Want proof without spoilers?  Consider this:  In the movie ""Troy"" there are two sunrises seen from the Greek camp on the shoreline, but for both sunrises the sun is seen rising over the Aegean Sea--to the WEST of Troy!  That movie also seems to reduce years of war to a mere few weeks.  Do such flaws or deficiencies mean that ""Troy"" or, for that matter, the Iliad should not be enjoyed?  Of course not!!!  The Homeric poem and also the film adaptations, drawing on ALL the tales of Troy and fair Helen, are ART, not painstakingly factual recreations of history.

The ""ultimate"" film story of the Trojan War would have to be a substantial miniseries mounted with all the artistry of a ""Masterpiece Theater"" production.  Until such an undertaking becomes a reality, we should try to appreciate the artistry with which the lesser or incomplete cinematic efforts try to approach such a complex topic.  This particular version gets five stars from me in recognition of how it attempts to draw so many threads of the story into such a compact telling.  As for ""Troy,"" while it does not remain faithful to the story of Achilles in the Iliad, it certainly conveys a powerful picture of that hero's character.  Each work of film art has its own merits.

Even the earlier cinematic film entitled ""Helen of Troy,"" which depicted the Greeks very much like gangsters, had some powerful moments between Helen and Paris.  So, criticism should not be rendered too hastily.  The re-imagining of this familiar tale should be welcomed because it offers the possibility of revealing new perspectives and insights, rather than just a faithful retread of those old and familiar thoughts with nothing new or different to add.",1060732800,2,3775,4.860719874804382
1521368,5,B00005JMH8,"I have been a huge fan of greek movies, but ""Helen of Troy"" 2003 stood out in many ways. The setting, the costumes, and the acting, were catching! Most actors were recognized by their acting ability, however some characters we off guard. Agamemnon, played by Rufus Sewell appeared as nasty and awful human being. I found him starring way too many times and he always had a look of hatred. The part that should have been taken out was when Helen was rapped by Agamemnon. They seriously should have come up with some other scene to represent the situation. Nevertheless, other character were well represented. The Prince of Troy, Matthew Marsden, is a gorgeous actor and they did a good job picking him out. Helen herself, was played by a beautiful woman, Sienna Guillory.
I think that overall thing that I liked the most about ""Helen of Troy"" 2003 was the origanlity.

For the most part the movie is accurate, but the producers left out a big part of it when they did not include all of the fighting that the gods had waged between thenselves when they picked sides.
They could have made it longer to put all the parts together. Four hours is not that long when you consider that ""The 10th Kingdom"" was much longer.",1051833600,,431,4.333333333333333
1521375,5,B00005JMH8,"It's not often that viewers are treated to a made-for-TV miniseries that is done with as much care as Helen of Troy. From the pastel colors of the ancient city to the Greek fleet, there is much to feast your eyes on. But that's not all, the story is rivetting and excellently acted. If you didn't understand how nations could go to war over Helen, you will now. And Rufus Sewell brings Agamemnon to life as a real person whose flaws are deadly. The sacrifice of Iphigenia is breath-taking. You will understand the motivation behind such a seemingly barbarious act.
We all know the Trojan horse seals the victory for the Greeks, but we've never been treated to such images of it before. There are many details which demonstrate that the writer was truly gifted - there wasn't a dry stretch in the old story.
Excellently acted, gorgeously filmed, intriguing story. Please get the DVD into production ASAP!",1051660800,12,903,4.7215189873417724
1521376,4,B00005JMH8,"Having enjoyed Homer's The Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid and as a long time fan of Greek mythology, I was looking forward with great anticipation to this mini-series.  Helen of Troy is a creditable follow-up to greek myth-based offerings such as The Odyssey (starring Armand Assante), Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts (both versions) and is brought to us by USA Networks, which recently released the acclaimed mini-series Attila (starring Gerard Butler).
The first half of the story centers on Helen of Sparta (Sienna Guillory) and Paris of Troy (Matthew Marsden).  It introduces us to Helens family - King Tyndareus, her sister Clytemnestra and brother Pollux (though his twin Castor is nowhere to be found) and shows the abduction of Helen by Thesseus, King of Athens (Stellan Skarsgard).  We are also  introduced to Paris/Alexandros who is fated to cause the destruction of Troy should he live.  On his birth, Prince Alexandros is therefore left on top of  Mount Aida to die but is taken in by a shepherd and raised as his own son (hence, re-named Paris).
As a young man, Paris discovers his true heritage and is reconciled with his family - namely, King Priam (John Rhys-Davies), Queen Hecuba (Maryam dAbo), Prince Hector (Daniel Lapaine) and Princess Cassandra (Emilia Fox).  Helen marries King Menelaus (James Callis) of Sparta, younger brother to the power-hungry and vicious King Agammemnon (Rufus Sewell), whose thirst for power is so great that he makes the ultimate sacrifice in his quest to become king of the Aegean.  When Helen and Paris meet, fall in love and elope, the stage is set for Agammemnon to use the elopement as an excuse to declare war on Troy.  Those of us who are familiar with tales of ancient Greece know how it all ends, but this adaptation does provide a few surprises and some notable changes to Homer and Virgils tales.
Highlights of this mini-series are the memorable performances, attractive cast, high production values and outstanding special effects.  Rufus Sewell (Cold Comfort Farm, The Very Thought of You and BBCs Middlemarch), newcomer Matthew Marsden (Black Hawk Down), Emilia Fox (Pride and Prejudice, The Round Tower) and veteran John Rhys-Davies (The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones) provide great performances.  Kudos goes to Rufus Sewell for his fantastic performance as the hard-hearted and villainous Agammemnon.  Matthew  Marsden and Daniel Lapaine (Prince Hector - though sadly in a much reduced role) are likeable, handsome, charismatic heroes.  The locations in Malta are believable and realistic.  The story itself is compelling and provides a great introduction to those who are unfamiliar with the Trojan War.
The mini-series does have its shortcomings. For one, I was not impressed with Sienna Guillorys performance as Helen.  To be true, anyone who takes on the role of Helen carries a great deal of weight on her shoulders. After all, very few women can live up to being called the most beautiful woman in the world.  Though pretty, Seinna's beauty and talent fall a little short of the demands of the role and she sometimes plays Helen as a pouty, simpering little brat.  I was also disappointed at the treatment of Menelaus and Hector. While Menelaus (who barely fights in the book) is treated as this kick ... warrior, the mighty Hector (who is the equivalent of Gladiators Maximus and is one of the greatest warriors in classic literature) actually takes a good beating from his enemies!  Achilles is, at best, a one-dimensional he man who is all brawn but no brains.
All these grievances aside, this is an enjoyable mini-series that deserves to be seen.  I will most likely purchase this when it comes out on DVD.  Those who enjoy a good dose of mythology and ancient/classic tales will no doubt enjoy this.  I am now looking forward even more to the upcoming film version of the Trojan War - Troy (starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom) - and hope to see a slightly different take on this classic story of love, hate, greed, revenge and honor.",1051660800,55,4045,4.943870014771049
1521377,4,B00005JMH8,"ONLY 4 stars because there were a few holes. Helen was missing a sibling. Clymenestra and Agamemnon were a few kids short and WHAT was that with Theseus????
The liberties taken with Helen of Troy can be written off due to time constraints and the huge undertaking of such an epic tale. You can excuse the way the Judgement of Paris was portrayed, the fate of Theseus and Pollus as well as the fate of Agamemnon simply because it was such an unbelievably BEAUTIFUL retelling.
The sets are beautiful. The costumes are beautiful. The actors are beautiful. (Even though I knew Rufus Sewell was a really bad guy, I couldn't help thinking...""he's so beautiful!"" *sigh* )
I've been intrigued by Greek Mythology since the age of 9. The first book I remember checking out from the local library as a child was ""D'aulaire's Book of Greek Myths"". I've been hooked ever since. Nearly 20 years later, HELEN OF TROY was the first look at the Trojan War that held my interest.
I could watch this movie over and over, and I fully recommend it to anyone interested in seeing a beautifully made beautiful movie...that took a few liberties with centuries old legends.  all that said...I REALLY ACTUALLY LIKED THE MOVIE!!!!",1051574400,,1203,4.728571428571429

7940526,5,B00005JMH8,"I enjoyed the movie a lot it was a different story about Helen than has been told before. The human tragedy was shown so well by all of the actors especially the woman who played Helen and the man who was her husband Menelaus. I remember mostly their pain shown in the actors faces. I  don't think I'll forget those faces for some time.
 I didn't know until I read the Iliad that Helen had a baby girl when she was taken to Troy by Paris. The human tragedy of being separated from a love one especially a child is not shown for Helen in any of the ""Helen of Troy"" I have seen so far. I have often wondered about the woman playing Helen having knowledge of the real Helen's baby daughter who was left in Sparta with her father Menelaus. The information of Helen's daughter would have even complicated her portraying Helen even more than what was shown by her for everything else that was going on in Helen's life.

A recommendation of a good play for some person who would like to try to understand or maybe should I say feel the pain shown by actors is the movie with Kathrine Hepburn called ""The Women Of Troy""  The play is pure craziness all the way though it.",1507248000,,1162,4.2681818181818185
