The description said it came with lesson plans which was one of the main reasons I purchased it. It arrived on time from Amazon and the DVD game is professionally done, but there are no lesson plans! Even the back of the DVD says. ""Lesson Plans:  This DVD contains teacher lesson plans and student worksheets in pdf format."" They are nowhere to be found and the web address listed on the site is not operation. I will be returning this. Unfortunately,  I had to open it and play it to find out that it is not what was advertised. I hope this does not cause me headaches when I go to return it.",1293494400,,716,4.296296296296297
8094209,5,B000BYAGJU,"Kudos to Backstage Shakespeare!  This interactive DVD is an effective and fun way to teach Shakespeare to students, especially those who learn best by not only reading and writing but talking about the text as well.  In my experience as both a high school and community college teacher, today's students often need that extra motivation to tackle Shakespeare's language and appreciate his themes.  The Backstage DVD provides that motivation in its appeal to students' natural competitive instincts.  Once they complete the reading and writing exercises and begin team warfare in answering questions aloud (as in ""Jeopardy""), they have so much fun they forget they are learning . . . especially during the lightning round!  Mesmerized as young people are these days by video games, this method of learning is familiar and attractive to them.

The DVD is particularly helpful to teachers insofar as it presents an original and organized way to teach <u>Hamlet</u>.  The lesson plans are thorough and require that students pay close attention to the play's text.  While this DVD may not be appropriate for all high school or community college classes, it is definitely an asset for those needing reinforcement for

reading and verbal skills.

I recommend it highly for high school teachers and, in some cases, community college instructors as well.",1136332800,2,1345,5.213953488372093
