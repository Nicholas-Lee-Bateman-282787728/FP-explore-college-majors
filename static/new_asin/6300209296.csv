239145,5,6300209296,"Definitely the finest of the old-time movie serials, and the finest live action version of Captain Marvel.  This movie was voted by Wizard magazine as the best comics-to-movie adaptation ever.
It has decent special  effects and a fine story.  A classic desert adventure, including angry  horde, offended god, and stalwart hero. The flying sequences are well done.  The cliff hangers are appropriately dramatic.  The Scorpion is a nice  serial villain, complete with hooded face and ultimate weapon, and Captain  Marvel remains my favorite hero.
If you like serials or Captain Marvel  you really can't go wrong with this.",955065600,35,620,5.244897959183674
239146,5,6300209296,"The only complaint I have is that this serial didn't continue for another 12 chapters. You'll be hooked on serials for life after watching this one. Everything in this serial hits on all cylinders. The nerdy Batson, the  villainous Scorpion,the wisecracking pal, the stodgy professors and the  scrappy secretary are all superbly cast and acted. Tom Tyler, a stunt man  and actor who later played the Mummy in one of the Universal monster  movies,plays Captain Marvel with appropriate heroic stoicism. We're treated  to mad villains with grand schemes,deathtraps and terrifying weapons. The  effects surprisingly hold up today, especially the flying scenes. Sets the  standard for movie serials.",950054400,7,694,5.429906542056075
239147,5,6300209296,"The 40s serial ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" has to be the ""Greatest Serial Ever Made.""  The special effects, for its tme, are outstanding.  The flying scenes stood the test of time until the first  Superman movie.
Many in the cast do a fine job.  Tom Tyler makes an  excellent Captain Marvel.  He looks the part and he demonstrates the great  athletic ability required of the part.  The actor playing Billy Batson  leaves a lot to be desired.  He delivers his lines as a Junior High student  would do in a school play.  The ""bad guys"" are just great.  They  fill the bill in typical 1940s serial style.
By today's standards, the  plot is childish, but for its time and targeted audience it must have  proved to be exciting from week to week.  Anyone with a penchant for  memoribelia would surely want this video in their collection.",943488000,5,838,4.585034013605442

239291,2,6300209296,"To be clear, my ""two stars"" review is for this specific, nameless ""bootleg"" DVD release (UPC barcode # 6 44827 52712 0) and NOT for the classic (1941) Republic serial itself which is definitely a ""five star,"" historical must-see.  In fact, having only watched the first four chapters as of this writing, I can already attest to the serial's high production value which rivals what *I* consider the greatest serial of all time: Flash Gordon.  Quality sets and costumes, well choreographed action.  It even has some flight special effects that rival Christopher Reeve's Superman decades later.  Put simply, Republic Pictures actually spent some money on this--unlike Columbia's 1940 rendition of Batman, which is an absolute joke by comparison.

No, the ""two stars"" are for this particular DVD release that I received from Amazon.  First off, it took me three tries to receive an undamaged copy, because the DVD case is so cheaply made, it cannot keep the discs secured in their housings, so they tend to arrive loose in cracked up, broken casings.  Secondly (but worse), this two-disc set is clearly from a not-so-legitimate source.  There is no company name (i.e. Joe Blow Video) printed anywhere on the package or DVD's--only a UPC barcode--that's it.  The official ""DVD logo"" (the registered trademark logo seen on all studio DVD releases) is not present and is instead replaced with a generic one that the releaser didn't have to pay for.  The two discs appear to be store-bought DVD-R's with *paper* decals stuck to them as labels; and the discs are clearly burned on a desktop home computer or home duplicator.  That said, to be fair, the transfer (so far) is amazingly good.  I say ""so far"" because, as mentioned, I've only watched the first four episodes, so there's no telling what horrors I might encounter as I progress.  But (so far), the picture and audio is quite good (which is the *only* reason I am generously giving it two stars instead of one--and that's being very cautiously optimistic that I will be able to complete the serial without technical issues).

However, thirdly (and worse of all), THERE IS NO MENU!!!!  That's right, you heard me.  These discs have NO MENU for choosing chapters.  NO MENU at all!!!  They simply start playing a continuous video file of six episodes each, from beginning to end, with no breaks in between.  Hopefully, your player will ""remember"" where you left off, or you'll have to fast-forward your way until you find it.  Even if you hit the [ >>| ] chapter forward key on your remote, it will skip multiple chapters and randomly land you somewhere in the middle of the serial.  I swear, I have never seen anything like it.  Assuming this is a homemade bootleg (which is clearly is), even with the most amateurish Windows Video Maker collection of home movies, it's easy to create a simple menu!  My ten year old nephew can do it!  My seventy-five year old mother can do it!  What the actual expletive?!

While I recommend this classic serial itself, this particular DVD release (UPC barcode # 6 44827 52712 0) is clearly bootlegged.  (NOTE to millennials:  that means pirated).  And before you say, ""Oh, it's old, so it's in the public domain,"" I would very cautiously question that.  As I understand it, the remnants of Republic's catalog and archives are currently owned and distributed by Viacom (i.e. Paramount and CBS); and the character formally known as ""Captain Marvel"" (NOTE to millennials: NOT the female superhero currently owned by Marvel, but the original Captain Marvel now called ""Shazam!"") is still firmly owned by DC and Warner Brothers.  Had this release come from Paramount and/or Warner Brothers or any of their subsidiaries, they would clearly say so on the package--whereas just the fact that the releaser of this DVD is very careful not to identify himself or his ""company"" is highly suspect and an indicator that he, too, is not fully confident of its copyright status--or doesn't care.  Furthermore, the fact that Amazon is even carrying it is shocking.

That said, since making the mistake of purchasing this nameless DVD version, I have noticed that there are two Blu-Ray releases now available: one under the name ""Grapevine Video"" (with not-so-great reviews, but at least they identify themselves), and a newer $18 version claiming to be a 4K scan from the actual Paramount achieves (i.e. a legitimate source, rather than someone's homemade download from YouTube).  I would try that direction.",1514419200,4,4476,4.931909212283044
239292,5,6300209296,"I purchased the Blu-ray version with the painted cover featuring Captain Marvel in the foreground and the scorpion device in the upper-right-hand corner. I bought it directly from Amazon. The booklet, interior insert, disc, reversible cover insert, case, and plastic sleeve all arrived in shrink-wrap, in mint condition as ordered. The content on the disc was as advertised. 2K resolution, all of the details as seen on Kino's site and on the reverse side of the case were correct. The commentary tracks were present, as were all of the episodes.

As for the content itself: The film transfer is magnificent. The content is suitable for ages nine and up. There isn't a drop of blood, yet there is plenty of on-screen death, people getting shot, choked, implied violence, and people getting killed in various creative fashions. As for adults watching, I'm seeing it as someone unfamiliar with serials and highly familiar with movies of the period. Each episode holds up far better than many feature films of the era, even ones that have received greater accolades and acclaim. The dialog, characters, story writing, lighting, pacing, editing, makeup, hair, sets, casting, acting, locations, and especially the props, effects, and costuming are superb. Modern film producers should take note of the lessons delivered in the commentary. There's plenty of useful history and technical innovation that can help those seeking a balance of budget and artfulness. Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck are a couple of my favorite commentators. Buy it and watch it with your kids, your date, your parents, or your grandparents. It's highly accessible and entertaining overall.",1513814400,,1659,5.2368421052631575

239452,5,6300209296,"The Adventures of Captain Marvel was one of my better impulse buys.  This film serial represents the superhero genre in its purest form because it was created specially for an audience of kids.  The producers weren't trying to global break box-office records, and parents in 1941 didn't feel the need to accompany their children to the movies. As a result, Captain Marvel is presented without tongue in cheek: there's no irony, no winking at the adults in the theater. The hero doesn't experience any existential crises, and the filmmakers don't feel the need to ""humanize"" him by having him break down in tears. Captain Marvel appears to rescue people from danger and to stop the bad guys, and when he's done he turns back into Billy Batson. And unlike the Saturday morning ""Shazam!"" series of my own childhood, The Adventures of Captain Marvel doesn't package weekly public service ads.

Action adventure films have certainly come a long way technologically (to the point where we're bored with the explosions and other special effects).  However, today's superhero films lack the directness of address that we find in this film series.",1507507200,3,1138,5.037234042553192

239454,4,6300209296,"""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" from 1941 is a fine example of Republic's best work, one of the 17 consecutive serials from the ""classic"" directing team of William Witney and John English.  Issued on videocassette in 1985, a new transfer came out four years later on Laserdisc, which was also used for an official DVD distributed by Artisan in 2003.  The new Blu-Ray from Kino-Lorber has a fairly serious transfer problem in Chapter Six, limiting my enthusiasm for it somewhat.  It also lacks the subtitles that were present in the closed-captioned Artisan DVD, and the increased resolution is a mixed blessing, but in most respects it is a significant improvement over the older editions.  Details follow my comments on the serial itself.

Radio operator Billy Batson (Frank Coghlan, Jr.) is with an archeological expedition in Siam led by John Malcolm (Robert Strange).  When the team plans to enter a tomb, despite a warning on an inscription, Billy feels uncomfortable and, remaining outside, is greeted by an old guy (Nigel de Brulier) brought to life by the opening of the tomb, who imparts super powers on Billy, who as Captain Marvel is tasked with protecting the innocent against misuse of the Golden Scorpion, the device that had been sealed in the tomb.  The change between Billy Batson and Captain Marvel (Tom Tyler) happens by uttering the old guy's name, ""SHAZAM,"" easier than having to carry a costume around.  The Golden Scorpion, with its lenses adjusted can do amazing things with the power of the sun, such as turning rocks into gold, and like any good serial-movie device, it can also generate a powerful destructive ray.  To avoid having it fall into the wrong hands, the Golden Scorpion and its five removable lenses are divided among Malcolm and his team members (Jack Mulhall, Bryant Washburn, George Pembroke, Harry Worth and Peter George Lynn), but soon the device and lenses are being stolen by a mysterious person known as ""The Scorpion"" who may be one of the team members.  And native guide Tal Chotali (John Davidson) is certainly not above suspicion.  It's up to Captain Marvel to fight this menace, aided by his alter ego Batson, his pal Whitey Murphy (Billy Benedict) and Malcolm's secretary, Betty Wallace (Louise Currie).

William Witney liked the plot, probably because it was straghtforward and wouldn't cause the problems he had with his previous serial, but it is nothing special.  Like Columbia's ""Mandrake the Magician"" of 1939 it has a masked bad guy, obviously one of a group of trusted associates, who needs to collect critical parts for the device that will make him Master of the Universe.  But the plot is not why these are watched, and ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" has all the good qualities of Republic's best efforts in costuming, special effects and stunt work, accompanied by a dynamic musical score under Cy Feuer's direction.  The flying scenes use the same technique seen in Republic's first serial, ""Darkest Africa"" in which a dummy travels on a wire, pulled by gravity.  Here, this is expertly mixed with footage of our hero taking off or landing, aided by stunt man David Sharpe.  And former weightlifter Tom Tyler looks the part, without need of any CGI enhancement.  To keep the audience guessing, the hooded Scopion alters his voice to sound like Gerald Mohr.  He has a lot of familiar henchmen, including Kenne Duncan, Carlton Young, Stanley Price and John Bagni in the credited cast.

Not only is Kino-Lorber's transfer sharper than Artisan's DVD, it has greatly improved sound.  They weren't able to correct the distortion near the reel change of the last chapter, but elsewhere the frequency response is better, and the frame-rate racket of the old editions has been eliminated.  Several disruptions due to splices and patching that were in the earlier transfers have been corrected, including the transitions to the technical credits after the ""Next Week"" titles.

Unfortunately, gremlins crept into Chapter Six, which runs slow by about 4%, 43 seconds more than the 16 minute, 40 second length on the earlier releases.  It looks like every 24th frame is repeated, resulting in rough motion, most easily seen in the opening credits where the background clouds moving across the screen pause briefly once per second.  This is less obvious during vigorous action, but shows up where cars are moving along a road, lurching as if a spark plug went bad.  The effect isn't severe, and the sound remains at the correct pitch, but it shouldn't have happened.  The other chapters are free of this problem.

The opening titles after Chapter One give a bad first impression of the film's condition, though this appears to be due to an admirable effort in restoration.  All but the first chapter have main titles with MPPDA certificate number 6910.  These should be different for each chapter, and while this has no other effect on the content, the short piece that includes the main title is fairly grainy and has a lot of scratches; it looks like Captain Marvel encounters heavy rain shortly after taking off.  But the title appears to include the full frame, instead of the slightly cropped image in Chapter One.  It was likely edited into the copy from the archive, in place of the 1950s reissue title, ""Return of Captain Marvel.""  For that I think it is worth tolerating a few seconds of scratchy film.  The recap titles also show slightly more of the frame than those in the Artisan DVD.  The improved sharpness makes even minor scratches more obvious than they were in earlier video releases, but there aren't many of them during the chapters.  It also makes the wires supporting Tom Tyler in some scenes easier to spot, but if you are noticing that you should move back from the screen and enjoy the show.

Kino-Lorber includes commentary tracks by people from different backgrounds, the task divided up by chapters.  Some of these are more about the comic book source than the serial, but they present a variety of viewpoints.  I found the commentary on Chapter Eleven by J. D. Witney, the director's son, to be the most interesting of these.  There is also a booklet by Matt Singer with general background information on the serial, illustrated with some of the posters used to advertise it.

Even with the transfer blunder in Chapter Six, the Kino-Lorber Blu-Ray, ASIN: B073LWR973, is superior in most respects to previous editions, and decidedly preferable to all those ""bootleg"" Laserdisc copies that have shown up recently.  It is also available as a DVD, see ASIN: B073ZYKLNB, likely from the same transfer, with the same issues.  Watched with the usual day or more between chapters, the minor faults of both the print and the plot are easily forgotten in the enjoyment of this fine serial.",1506902400,14,6760,4.929390997352162
239455,4,6300209296,"So this is the one many people consider the best. It is certainly up there, since it comes from the best serial directing team of all time (Witney-English). I still rate Daredevils of the Red Circle as number one, edging out Flash Gordon. But Adventures of Captain Marvel probably rates third (perhaps tied with another Republic entry) on my all-time-greatest list of serials.

Now, a note about some ""problems"" with the Kino Blu-ray.

Chapter stops: Come on Kino - you are taking the term ""chapter stops"" too literally. As with Kino's release of ""Daredevils..."", the only chapter stops on the disc take you to the start of each episode. At a minimum there should also be a chapter stop to skip the opening music and get to the recap cards, but additional stops would have been appreciated as well. After all, the scene selections menu is already there to take you to the start of any particular episode..

Poor quality video: I was pretty worried when I saw the opening credits. It actually did look worse than the DVD (and perhaps the VHS as well, but I did not break that out to check). Unlike Kino's Daredevils of the Red Circle Blu-ray, which was a jaw dropping improvement over past releases, Captain Marvel shows some warts. Mainly this is in the opening credits. They are so bad that they really should have been accompanied by one of those warning screens about quality of archival materials, blah, blah, blah. The good news is that outside of the poor opening credits sequence (which another reviewer reports is used on all episodes, which appears to be the case), the rest of the serial is mostly in excellent condition and the video and audio quality are, overall, improvements over prior releases (although, such a nice presentation would have benefited from more chapter stops...)

Chapter commentary by first-time viewers: Where the commentary shines, it is outstanding. But I felt there was a wasted opportunity to bring in some additional authoritative voices instead of listening to commentary by first-time viewers, something I'd prefer to hear in person from friends and family when I show off this excellent quality serial for them. But this is the least of the concerns I have about the Blu-ray, because I am not that interested in most audio commentaries anyway. It seemed worth mentioning though given how the commentary tracks are highlighted in some other reviews. So far the commentary for the first and last chapters, and the commentary by Leonard Maltin and Witney's son, were all excellent. But I threw in the towel on the commentary for some of the other chapters -- but may give them another shot later.

Overall, a great buy for cliffhanger serial fans! The only notes I would reiterate (hear me Kino!) for future releases like this are: (1) Please put a little more effort into cleaning up the quality of the title sequences, since they are used over and over and (2) chapter stops does not mean one stop per chapter!

UPDATE:  I added a photo of the menu screen.",1506556800,4,2997,4.796511627906977

239458,4,6300209296,"BOTTOM LINE: Highly regarded as THE BEST movie serial ever made, and I agree 100%. It set a standard few other chapter films ever measured up to. This Blu-ray from Kino Lorber is very nice, with improved audio/video thanks to a new 4k scan.  It isn't without its flaws as it was a remaster and NOT a full-on restoration, unfortunately.  Still, this hi-def release is far better-looking than the old 2003 DVD from Artisian/Republic. 4 STARS!

THE STORY: In this loose adaption of the beloved Fawcett Comics character, young Billy Batson is granted the ability to become Captain Marvel - ""the world's mightiest mortal!"" - in order to thwart a dastardly character calling himself The Scorpion, who schemes to gain control of a powerful ancient statue in order to subjugate mankind!

THOUGHTS: This is the one that started it all. Superman may have been first in print, but Captain Marvel beat Supes to the big screen by almost a decade. And in spite of the dozens of chapter plays that came both before & after, none of them achieved the same level of quality, polish and pure energetic fun as 1941's ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL.  And the Big Red Cheese still put the beat down on Superman when it came to visual effects, too.  While Clark Kent's alter ego had to rely on cartoons to fly, the Captain took to the skies as a real flesh & blood person, thanks to the mesmerizing optical trickery of the ingenious Lydecker brothers. The F/X are dated and obvious in comparison to modern hyper-realistic visuals, but they maintain a charm and fascination all their own, and can still fool the young (and young at heart!). Throughout the 12 action-packed chapters, co-directors William Witney & John English wisely resist the temptation to have their actors, (mostly seasoned veterans of the silent screen era), go too far overboard into full-blown caricatures - well, most of the time. LOL. For my money, this is easily my all-time favorite movie serial. (The hammy and ham-handed UNDERSEA KINGDOM is a guilty-pleasure sentimental second.)

THE BLU-RAY: The hi-def presentation of ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL comes from the folks at Kino Lorber.  The picture is noticeably sharper than all previous formats, and the sound is cleaner, too. But this print isn't without its problems, foremost of which are the presence of numerous annoying vertical scratches throughout the entire run of the serial. Also, the hi-resolution scanning inadvertently reveals the wires which suspended actor Tom Tyler during the numerous optical process shots as he ""flew"" to the rescue, diminishing the effect a tad. This Blu-ray release has but one bonus feature but Holy Moly!, it's a good one: a full-length audio commentary track for each and every chapter of the film! Perhaps the best thing about this extensive supplement, is that rather than the same guy droning on for over 3 1/3 hours, the presentation is broken up by having several different film historians & fans take on a chapter or two a piece. The widely diverse points of view make these commentaries constantly engaging. It's a fascinating listen and is highly recommended for fans of both the film and the character.

The packaging here touts transferred in 4K.  Sorry, Kino, you really need to stop being disingenuous, which you are on pretty much all your packaging.  You can scan anything in 4K - so what?  So they scanned an element that isn't optimal in 4K - brilliant.  The fact is that some of this is okay and some is less than okay - it's very inconsistent in contrast, wear and tear, and everything else.  We don't care about the 4K - we care about what elements were scanned.

Anyway, as I said, l love the serial so despite the visual shortcomings I had to have it.",1506038400,3,707,4.3106060606060606

--- Twelve (!) audio commentaries: Three hours & 36 minutes.
Kino originally hired film historian Tom Weaver to provide background for two or three episodes,
but he had the novel idea of recruiting his friends and colleagues to cover all twelve episodes
(Weaver served as editor to avoid duplication).
Everything you'd ever want to know about Captain Marvel, Whiz Comics and Republic Pictures.
--- Fourteen page booklet.
--- Your choice of Blu-Ray covers: both based on original 1940's artwork.
--- The only thing it doesn't have is subtitles.

Overkill:
The Kino-Lorber picture is ""remastered  from a 4K Scan from Paramount Pictures Archives""
Apparently Paramount still has the original negative of a 76 year-old serial.
This is almost unheard of.
I think it's worth the effort - I hope enough copies sell to justify the expense
The picture is not pristine, but it is a big improvement over my old DVD.
The same opening credits are re-used for each episode and have visible scratches, but once past that the picture is quite impressive.
Captain Marvel was actually produced by Republic Pictures, but when Republic filed for bankruptcy in the 1950s, it's back catalog was acquired by Paramount.

In 1940, Republic Studios set out to produce the first movie serial based on a comic book superhero.
They wanted Superman, but couldn't reach a deal with National Periodical Publications (later known as DC Comics).
Captain Marvel (Whiz Comics) was Republic's second choice.
Captain Marvel was a blatant rip-off of Superman:
Billy Batson was an ordinary American boy who received the ability to become Captain Marvel from the wizard Shazam.
He does so by speaking the wizard's name, conferring upon him these powers:
S = The Wisdom of SOLOMON
H = The Strength of HERCULES
A = The Stamina of ATLAS
Z = The Power of ZEUS
A = The Courage of ACHILLES
M = The Speed of MERCURY
Captain Marvel wore a trademarked skin-tight suit, bullets bounced off him, AND HE COULD FLY LIKE SUPERMAN.
Republic's flying effects were spectacular.
They used a life-size dummy made of paper mch.
Pulleys were connected to each shoulder and leg, which were then suspended on wires stretched between poles.
By contrast,
the Columbia Pictures Superman serial, which eventually appeared in 1948, used a cheesy animated cartoon technique for flying sequences .

To play Captain Marvel, Republic chose Tom Tyler (photo 3), who had been a B-movie Western star since the 1920s, but whose career was on a downhill slide.
Two years later, Tyler would play another superhero in the 1943 Columbia serial ""The Phantom"" (photo 4).
He even played a supervillain in the 1940 Universal feature film ""The Mummy's Hand"" (photo 4)

I was pleasantly surprised to view this serial.  Images are sharp, and sound is good.  Billy Batson annoyed me at first, but I came to like him better than the actor who played Captain Marvel.  I found the captain to be boring with no personality.  He did not say many lines in the entire serial.  The plot moved along, and I never guessed who was The Scorpion!

When I purchased this DVD, I anticipated even sharper quality than the two previously bought VHS copies ( one an official Republic VHS Release...the other official VHS seller, escapes me ). Though none purchased had the slightly deeper contrast I had finally hoped to obtain, the Republic double VHS set surpasses this DVD I had bought with the hope of sharper picture clarity...including the proclaimed ""Digitally Remastered"" 2-disc set from AC Comics' Cultreto.com. At this point, from what I've seen, the Republic Studio double-cassette VHS release is the one to get until a better master for DVD is located. This VHS copy really makes a liar out of the term ""digitally remastered"" as used by some DVD manufacturers. Cutting corners to squeeze an entire 12 chapter serial classic such as ""Adventures Of Captain Marvel"" onto a single disc is too great a sacrifice for a superb classic such as this...unless you are working from an absolute pristine quality 35mm transfer. Even the rousing soundtrack from this serial sticks in my mind when taking walking excercises.

Marvel is chasing the villains who are driving a truck. Will he catch them? He flies at top speed - CRASHES INTO THE OPEN CARGO SECTION AND GETS CAPTURED.

This one has been lauded as the best one but that's tough to say that.  There are many that are the best ""for what they are trying to do""/what their category is.  In other words, you can't compare a Buck Rogers adventure serial or Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars vs. a Captain Marvel superhero serial vs. Monster and the Ape which is so bad it's good. Flash/Buck have an adventure hero but Captain Marvel you have a superhero but you have to guess who the bad guy is.  One that is also good for guessing who the bad guy is King of the Rocket Men who is a hero in a jetpack/rocketman thing going on who has to figure out the bad guy which I thought was good if you like old sci fi, old super hero stuff and had the mystery element and was underrated and is almost as good.  But I like all of those elements and if you like the category you already like something about it before you watch.  And you have other types of serials such as underground, underwater, jungle etc. which are fun that are different and good for their time.  So, really, due to the differences in all of these, they should all get best of in different categories and should all be watched and enjoyed for their variety.  it makes for more fun :)",1366934400,,1347,4.1698841698841695

They were done by the Lydecker brothers and in my opinion no other movie since has made you believe a man can fly.  The shots are breathtaking at times.

Granted, it's a bit dated by today's standards, but still it holds up pretty well.  The pacing of the story gives only so much room to catch your breath.  The biggest thrill I got, personally, was watching the entire thing with a buddy of mine who is close to 15 years older than I am (47-you do the math!) and seeing how big a blast he was having; like reliving his childhood in Los Angeles when these things played weekly at the local movie house.  Classic!

The flying scenes are rather imaginative but not cheesey (well, maybe except for the dummy strung on wires and flown via gravity!) and the other effects, like exploding mountains, exploding airplanes, explod-well you get the idea!  The prime effect shot, though, is perfect AND lacking at the same time, that being the transformation when ""SHAZAM!"" is shouted.  Instead of a  bolt of magic lightning, we're treated to a fireball explosion of smoke and light that erupts from the bottom of the screen before Billy can close his mouth, then without so much as a jump-cut Captain Marvel is standing there.  Just think how much more spectacular that would be with some airborne electricity in the mix!

What always makes me laugh with the cliffhangers is that the characters get into fist fights, have chairs broken on their heads, and tossed out of windows - yet they manage to never get their hats knocked off. And I thought that Krazy Glue was a fairly new adhesive developed later than the 30s and 40s. Next, I have ""Secret Agent X9"" ready to go.",1315008000,,620,4.353448275862069

The Lydeckers who did the special effects did a wonderful job. The flying is superb for the time. The pace of the film is fast and tight.
This was the first comic transferred to live action and Republic studios did a great job.

240055,5,6300209296,"Republic Pictures' 1941 ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" largely lives up to all its hype.  Is it the best serial ever made - I guess that is a matter of taste.  Personally I consider Universal's Flash Gordon to be the best serial ever made and I give the edge to Republic's second super hero serial ""Spy Smasher"" as the best super hero serial ever made.  Still the ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" stands heads and shoulders over most examples of this lost art form.

Loosely based (all Republic Pictures' comic adaptions were loosely based on their source material - the most extreme example of this would be their adaption of Timely Comic's Captain America) on the hero that first appeared in Fawcett Comics 's Whiz Comics number 2 this great serial deals with young Billy Batson (Frank Coghlan, Jr.)who is granted the powers of the gods and the ablity to transform into the flying super hero Capt. Marvel (Tom Tyler).  As Marvel he is charged to protect mankind from the evil masked villian the Scorpion and his Scorpion death ray.

As with most Republic's masked villians the Scorpion is actually one of several suspect scientists who are killed off one by one.  In the end it doesn't really matter who the Scorpion actually was and there was no way the serial's young audience ever had a chance at figuring out his I.D. because whenever the Scorpion appears on camera his voice is dubbed with a really sinister voice provided by some one other than the actor the villian is ultimately revealed to be.

While Tom Tyler is top billed as the Captain it is actually Coghlan as a slightly older version of the comic book's Billy Batson who carries the serial.  While Tyler looks pitch perfect as the Captain (only Chris Reeves and Buster Crabbe rival him for not looking silly in tights) his acting was always a bit stiff and his voice was a bit to high for a super hero.  Coghlan's Batson is better played but is so honest that he could give you a sugar attact. But it is not the acting that this serial is noted.  This serial's rep is largely based on it special effects.  The shots showing the Captain in flight were ground breaking for 1941 and I dare say that many of them hold up today.

Another thing that this serial is noted for is its violence.  In these pre Miranda days no one seemed to have a problem showing kids a hero picking up defenseless bad guys and throwing them off high building's roof tops.  So extreme are the Captain's actions at time that in a late 1970's spoof of Republic serials ""J-Men Forever"" the Captain is referred to as the Caped Madman.

As fun as this serial is its plot holes must be pointed out.  Too often the Scorpion is shown to have changed into his mask and robes to carry out his evil deeds when there is no one there to see him.  I guess he must have really enjoyed how cool he looked in the robes.  Also the Scorpion's chief henchman Barnett (played stiffly but wonderfully by Kenneth Duncan)who committs multiple murders appears to get off scott free for his many crimes.  And why with so many people being murdered does no one ever consider calling the police (and why the police never investigate the number of bodies being dropped through out the city is another question).  Instead they just keep attending pointless meetings as their numbers drop.

But even with those short comings the ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" is still one of the finest examples of Republic's serial making that can be found.",1306281600,,3450,4.593800978792822
240056,4,6300209296,"When I was young, I was an avid comic book fan. I am also old enough to have seen the original in our local theater. The ""Captain Marvel"" serial was very good, a real ""comic book"" character. The DVD arrived in very good time, and in excellent condition.",1271980800,4,253,4.291666666666667
240057,5,6300209296,"This 1941 Republic serial has the reputation of being the finest serial of them all. My experience with serials is limited but I won't quibble with that judgment. It's a fine piece of work.

This serial is divided into 12 episodes forming one complete story. The viewer must watch the various episodes exactly (presumably) as they were shown theatrically. Every episode has its opening credits, recap (except the first, of course), and closing credits complete with FBI warning, etc. Additionally all but the first episode ""rewinds"" to set up the previous cliffhanger. This is not quite as tiresome as it sounds because most of the cliffhangers are ""cheats""; you see scenes in the resolution that most definitely were not in in the setup. Some viewers might have wished for a strung together feature option but in my opinion the DVD producers made the proper call here. The cliffhangers lose all impact otherwise and one misses a large part of the charm of the serial format.

It should be noted that the running time is quite long - over three and a half hours. The episodes run between 15 and 20 minutes apiece except for the first which is more like 30 minutes. One can select each episode from the DVD menu and each episode is broken down into 5 scenes except the first which is 8 scenes. The only extra is a theatrical trailer.

I have no idea what kind of restoration was done but the DVD is quite watchable. The sound quality is typical of that era (1942) but not horrible. It goes without saying that it is black and white and full screen (4:3) format.

The story itself is quite engrossing. An archeological expedition finds a magical device with incredible powers. Pieces from the device are shared amongst the expedition members. One of them is secretly a delightful power mad villain who schemes to possess the device. But the device has a protector in the person of Captain Marvel.

One wonders whether the story was written around Captain Marvel or whether Captain Marvel was inserted into a preexisting script. It is hard to imagine Superman being wedged into this story and still being recognizable as the Siegal and Shuster creation. Liberties were taken with the origin of Captain Marvel but the essence of the character is intact.

All in all fine entertainment for those prepared to accept the serial formula. It is easy to see how kids of that era would be drawn back to matinee after matinee to see how it all played out. Highly recommended.",1271203200,4,2463,4.729603729603729
240138,5,6300209296,"No pale, smiling Superman is our Captain Marvel! Cap is a bonafied FORCE OF NATURE, and he hands out death to his foes as if he were passing out free candy. Standing too close to the edge of a roof or a dam? GET AWAY QUICK, because Captain Marvel will pick you up and THROW YOU TO YOUR SCREAMING DEATH! Cap walks - jaw set and fists clenched - into the gunfire of a gang of thugs. Each step he takes is clearly just another nail in their coffin. He seems furious that any of these fools would dare oppose him! Bullets bounce off his chest, and one of the gangsters just screams and runs for it! In one scene a gang of horsemen are shooting at him from a machinegun nest, and he charges straight into the bullts, tosses the men out of the nest, hefts the machinegun off the tripod...and shoots the men with their own gun...

  Captain Marvel...not a man to mess around with. Tom Tyler look GREAT in the costume, and his natural strength shows in scenes where he hefts a man off his feet and throws him like a ragdoll. The stuntwork is excellent. The flying scenes are well realized with the tech of the era. The villain (a robed fellow called the Scorpion) is one of the top ten to EVER appear in a serial, and the fight scenes are all top notch. A simple story with clear direction and interesting supporting cast. Even one of the suspects servants gets into a great fight with the Scarab's gangsters, with ""Action Butler"" slugging thugs left and right in defence of his masters property.

240140,5,6300209296,"""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" is often considered, in many quarters, the best serial ever produced.  I think I have to agree.  The clunkiness of the 1930s serials, though charming (think Flash Gordon and those little space ships on strings), is gone and it wouldn't be until the 1950s when serials started looking a little threadbare and dry of ideas.  In between all that is Captain Marvel ... a lavish, smart and genuinely exciting cliff-hanger involving a masked villain, an Egyptian arheological dig, men in pith helmets and, of course, Captain Marvel, played by Tom Tyler with few words but lots of brawn.  Young Billy Batson is given the power to summon tons of superpowers whenever he utters the word ""Shazam!""  That's when smoke appears and young Batson is turned into the tights-donning, cape-wearing Captain Marvel.  He flies (and the flying looks really terrific, even today) and he pummels and he basically gives the hat-wearing, gun-toting, cigarette-smoking thugs beatings they won't soon forget.  What's so funny about this superhero serial (in fact, just about all superhero serials) is the fact that the un-superheroed Billy Batson fights just as much as his alter ego and does just about as well, so you wonder why he even needs to utter ""Shazam!""  Go back to the Batman serials and Captain America and you'll see the same thing ... guys who are superheroes but don't really need the costumes because they fight pretty well in their sportcoats and fedoras.  But it's all great fun, and Captain Marvel is greater fun than most.  Real craftsmanship went into this one, from jaw-dropping special effects, to a script that actually displays some wit.

I still feel the Superman and Batman serials are more exciting. But the one thing Captain Marvel has in it's favor is, it's roughly one hour shorter than the other serials mentioned. Therefore it doesn't get bogged down with wasted filler that many other serials seem to suffer from. Unlike the Superman/ Batman serials there is no voice-over telling you to come back next week. Recaps are done in written form. Although he has similar abilities to Superman, Captain Marvel does not have Superman's patience or compassion. Just get this disc and you'll see what I mean. As for the DVD itself. It's all 12 chapters on one disc, a trailer, a play all mode or chapter select. English only language track and no subtitles. But it is closed caption encoded if your dvd player and tv are set up for it. I recommend using chapter select over play all. Here's why. After a chapter is over you have to sit through the Artisan Entertainment sign. Then you have to wait for the Republic Pictures logo with the eagle on the mountain. Then you have to endure the warning page. This happens in between every chapter and believe me it's very time consuming. Chapter select avoids all that and goes straight to the actual production.",1219622400,6,1389,4.673469387755102
240144,5,6300209296,"Out of all the serials I've seen from back in the day, this serial has to be my all-time favorite(yes, even over Superman). This 12 chapter serial, directed by William Witney and John English for Republic Pictures, starred Tom Tyler as Captain Marvel. Tom, as some of you may know, starred in the '43 serial of The Phantom. The serial, itself, was Republic's first foray into comic book adaptions(not including comic strip Dick Tracy)and was considered having the best production values and screenwriting of it's day. Having even better production that the Superman serials. The Golden Scorpion is found during an expedition to Siam, which is also where young journalist Billy Batson meets the wizard Shazam while trapped in a crypt. Shazam grants him the ability to change into Captain Marvel in order to prevent the Golden Scorpion from falling into the wrong hands. Thus begins our story and a good one at that. The serial also stars Frank Coghlan Jr., William Benedict, Louise Curry, Robert Strange, Harry Worth, Bryant Washburn & John Davidson(no, not that John Davidson, lol).

The DVD is also short on extras as in none related to the serial other than the trailer.  My main beef with this one is if you accidentally stop the serial by using the stop button do not press it a second time.  If you do you will have to watch the rest of the serial one chapter at a time, after which you are bounced out to the menu asking which chapter to play next.  This is ridiculous, but as I said it was my main complaint, which isn't that bad of an inconvenience to have this one on DVD.  It is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.

240147,5,6300209296,"The Adventures of Captain Marvel is an outstanding example of the magic the old serials could produce. No wonder folks used to go to the movies every week like clockwork.

Captain Marvel produces real thrills 67 years after its release. The masterful  direction and editing of these 12 chapters, supplied by the kings of serials William Witney and John English, don't have an ounce of fat or dead air despite a 3  hour length. The special effects are simply outstanding and jaw dropping, not losing a bit of punch even in this deep into CGI domination. The use of miniatures are perfectly edited with actual explosions and back screens to tremendous effect (explosions and cave-ins have actual thunder and weight!); and when Captain Marvel flies . . . well, I have watched a few scenes over and over, and despite an explanation on the back of the DVD box, I still can't figure out how certain scenes looked so darn real. No kidding, it looked more realistic even than the sexist CGI in the newest Superman movie.

Tom Tyler is perfectly cast as the world's most powerful mortal. He had a true superhero's face and voice, and he must have been a tremendously powerful man. In more than one scene he lifts men over his head, supporting them with nothing but his arms, and walks with them. He makes it look perfectly natural. I particularly loved Frank Coghlan Jr.'s performance as Billy Batson. Anyone that thinks Billy was a wimp must not have noticed how many times over the twelve chapters he was beaten unconscious, only to come back for more with his engaging, sideways grin and bouncy gate.

It is easy to see why this serial rates so highly in the pantheon of great popular entertainment.

Finally, it should be noted (with pleasure) that the Captain Marvel of this serial was not hindered by the strict moral code exhibited by Superman or other superheroes. No-siree. The Captain routinely throws the Scorpion's thugs off buildings and cliffs, sending them screeching to their deaths, and has no problem whatever in beating information out of folks. I think my favorite moment was when Captain Marvel pushes a captive's face ever closer to a bed of nails until he starts jabbering information for all he's worth (Tyler's face in these moments holds all the sympathy of a hawk with a mouse in its talons). Heck, in one scene while waking forward through a hail of gunfire, bullets ricocheting off his chest, he wears a grin of pure, sadistic anticipation.

This is one superhero that really loved his work.

240218,5,6300209296,"This is one of the 2 best movie serials of all time.  I would recommend that any fan of escapist cinema and classic movies see at least a couple of the chapters, since it is such a fine example of what a good serial could be.  It is fast paced, has good fight scenes, and, for the time period, excellent special effects.  In fact, until perhaps the 1978 film `Superman,' there were no superior the flying sequences anywhere on TV or cinema.  Along with these legendary sequences, the screen presence and performance of Tom Tyler really make this a magical experience.

At the time of this serial, Tom Tyler was a veteran (and underrated) movie actor, entering the downward slide of a career.  Besides having about 15 years of fight scenes on his resume, he had been both a lumberjack and a champion weight lifter, so that he had a lean, athletic physique and carried himself like a strong and tough man.  Also, his chiseled facial features, dark hair and steely eyes projected determination and formidability.  Although given very few lines, Tyler was completely believable and magnetic in the role.  Tyler's Captain Marvel is truly one of the most awesome serial heroes, right up there with Buster Crabbe's Flash Gordon.  Frank Coghlan Jr. is perfect as Cap's alter ego, Billy Batson, and the rest of the supporting cast is good as well.

Fans of the comic book and TV versions of Captain Marvel should be warned that this serial is, in several significant ways, very different from the Cap they remember.  Part of this is due to the fact that whenever Republic Pictures adapted a comic strip, they took some liberties.  The other factor is that this serial was filmed when the Captain Marvel comic strip was only 1 year old, before the tone and spirit of Captain Marvel had been established (the Captain Marvel comics did not really develop a consistent style or sensibility until about 1943 or so: it isn't till around that time that the really classic Captain Marvel stuff started coming out).

Without spoiling too much, viewers should be warned that on at least 2 occasions, Captain Marvel summarily dispatches some of the minor villains.  Dispatch, as in sending them to meet their maker.  This is understandable within the context of the times and 1930's ideal of a hero.  In 1941, comic book heroes had not settled into their now ubiquitous code of non-lethality.  The forerunners of the super-heroes, the pulp heroes such as the Shadow and the Spider, had no reservations toward casually gunning down a few thugs.  Likewise, audiences in 1941 were of a generation that witnessed law enforcement officers summarily executing Bonnie & Clyde as well as John Dillinger.

Captain Marvel's readiness to kill might also serve as a rationale for Billy's hesitancy to use his alter ego.  In this version, Billy gets into fistfights with thugs, even when he is outnumbered, rather than turning into Cap.  For dramatic purposes, this makes sense because it allows for various death traps to be set and keeps the fight scenes exiting.  But it also fits into a subtext that perhaps Captain Marvel has too much power, that he is perhaps like genie from a bottle, a quasi-demonic expression of the Id.  This Captain Marvel, who gets a little too violent sometimes, and who Billy Batson only reluctantly calls upon, could be considered an early forerunner of the Incredible Hulk.

Despite this Captain's occasional lapses into vigilantism, the overall spirit of this serial keeps within the norms of the era and the genre, and so is great fun and escapism.  This serial is vastly superior to either of the Superman serials (1948 & 1950) as well as the Captain Marvel `Shazam!' TV series of the 1970's.  On an ultra low budget and long before CGI, this serial recreated the magic of the comics.",1201737600,4,3787,4.812982998454405

Fawcett lawsuit! As entertainment, it does veer away from the comics somewhat. Billy Batson isn't a 13 year old, but a young man in his late teens or early 20s. Most of the original supporting cast is missing but Tom Tyler is near perfect as the Ol' SHAZAM-er(except for that slight Mid-Western accent!)The action centers around an ancient artifact called the Scorpion which contains lenses that  can either turn base metals into gold or fire destructive power beams! The lenses are scattered and a masked villain, who also calls himself the Scorpion, spends the entire series trying to retrieve them, for they only work if they are together. The Big Red Cheese (as Marvel is nicknamed by fans) tries to stop him. The action is high octane with gunplay and violence that may be too strong for the very young. Captain Marvel is stern and like the pulp heroes of the day, isn't squeamish about using intimidation to get a thug to talk. The highlight of the series are the scenes of our hero in flight. Contrary to popular belief, it was Captain Marvel,not Superman, who first demonstrated the power of flight and in this series the stunt is pulled off by three methods: 1. Tom Tyler supported by wires against a cloudy backdrop ala George ""Superman"" Reeves 2. The spectacular take offs and landings by a stuntman. 3. The most clever of all, a lifelike dummy sliding on wires filmed in a real landscape! The overall affect is amazing and has you truly beleiving that a man can fly!

The story was good and starts with an Expidition to the Valley of Tombs where a group of people (archeologists?) find a hidden chamber in a tomb.  In that hidden chamber is one of the most powerful tools known by man.  The golden scorpion, with some lenses that are held by it, it can turn any regular object to gold, or destroy any living thing from existence.  When they realize the potential for evil that this item could have, the men divvy out the lenses and scorpion to each other and decide to each hide his piece somewhere.

At the same time, Billy is met by an old man who tells him he is imbued with the power to become Captain Marvel.  However he is told not to abuse his powers, and to only use them to stop the Scorpion.

The serial continues as the omnious Scorpion is brought to life and is trying to get all the hidden pieces of the golden scorpion so that he can rule the world!

The thing I like about this is, as previously stated, it is from 1941, but doesn't adhere to the normal ""Super Hero Rules"".  People do die at the hands of Captain Marvel... but they deserved it!  Saying that, there is of course no really violent imagery.  Simply Captain Marvel doing stuff like throwing guys off the top of a building or whatever.  But you get the idea.

When young Billy Batson uttered the magic phrase ""Shazam,"" with a flash of lightning he turned into ""The World's Mightiest Mortal.""  The special effects are incredible for the era, with the flying scenes far better than in the ""Superman"" serials.  Dave Sharpe did the take-offs and landings.

Tom Tyler (Vincent Markowski, 1903-1954) is just as good in this role as in his other comic book incarnation, ""The Phantom.""  Tyler was a Western hero in the '20s and '30s, toured with circus shows when leading roles were no longer offered, then found new life as a serial superhero.  In all, he starred in 90 Westerns and 7 serials.  Frank Coughlin, Jr. is convincing as Billy Batson.

The whole thing is extremely well done, considered by many the all-time best.  There's not too much I can add to that.",1137024000,4,862,4.77027027027027

240293,5,6300209296,"The Adventures of Captain Marvel has to be without a doubt one of the finest movie serials ever made.  For 1941, the special effects are top notch.  And the story line is very fluid and easy to follow.

The fact that the producer took artistic liberties with Captain Marvel's origin story, does not detract from how good this serial is.

The Adventures of Captain Marvel stars Tom Tyler as Captain Marvel and Frank Coughlin, Jr. as Billy Batson.  For the medium, there performances are very well executed and not too terribly over the top.

With this serial, it is easy to tell that the studio actually put out some expense for sets, scenery and location.  All in all a very well made serial.",1122508800,13,692,4.5772357723577235
240294,5,6300209296,"I have heard a lot of hype about this serial. I eventually got the tape and the comments I heard were no hype but real. This is the best super hero action serial ever. I got the DVD version too and everything was crisp and clear.

This is one character that deserves an appropriate remake in the big screen. Although nearly similar to Superman in powers, Captain Marvel is different in all other aspects. It's going to be a blockbuster for that reason.

Batman and Superman on the big screen have fully run their novelty into the ground. ""Batman Begins"" will flop because it's not novel. ""Fantastic 4"" will hit it big because it's refreshing. That will also be for ""Shazam"" if someone makes a major movie out of it.",1118102400,3,715,4.492307692307692
240295,4,6300209296,"If I were a kid in the thirties of forties, I know I would have liked this serial.

Sure, you can see the wires sometimes. And yeah, that dummy they use for long shots of our hero flying is a hoot. But hey, that's what these serials were all about.

This was one of the more cleverly written serials. The plot was quite good. Captain Marvel even killed a few of the bad guys!",1117670400,3,375,4.054054054054054
240296,4,6300209296,"I saw this serial for the first time(I was a small kid,then) at my neighborhood movie theatre, in 1952 (eleven years after it was made).Boy,what a thrill! The menace of  ""THE SCORPION"",the young Billy Batson,old SHAZAM'S(silent movie star Nigel de Brulier) cavern. THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL was the first serial who depicted the exploits of a comic book super hero:THE BIG RED CHEESE,Captain Marvel himself! Of course, I'm not forgeting cartoonist Charles Calvin Beck(C.C.Beck)&  writer Otto Binder,the talented creators of the great comic book super hero,phisically modeled on the actor Fred MacMurray. Tom Tyler is a great silver screen Captain Marvel;Frank Coughlan,a perfect Billy Batson. Without doubt,the best serial ever. SHAZAM!",1111536000,2,743,5.625
240357,4,6300209296,"This Republic serial has been almost universally hailed as the finest of all the old movie serials: it works on just about every level, and is about as exciting as you could want. The true wonder are the special effects: with careful photography of a dummy suspended from wires and truly ingenious stunts (aided by very thoughtful and careful direction), Captain Marvel's flying at time seems more believable here than Superman's in the multimillion dollar film of the late 70s. The storyline departs in many ways from the original comic book series (here the old wizard Shazam specifically turns teenage reporter Billy Batson into Captain Marvel only to protect a Thai mystic relic that is the key of the serial's entire plot), but the series really captures the feel of Golden Age comics, from the inventively scary deathtraps into which Billy and his friends are placed ito the mellifluously voiced villain, The Scorpion, who wears a shiny embroidered silken robe with a matching hood. The actors are terrific, especially the very winning Frank Coghlan Jr. who is ideal as Billy Batson--he has a appealling smile he flashes only rarely, but always to great effect.",1109980800,8,1167,5.020618556701031
240358,5,6300209296,I have to admit I have seen quite of few of these old time movie serials when I first purchased my VCR back in 87'...Captain Marvel stands out ahead of the pack because the story stil holds up after all these years.  It may be still about the traditional good vs. evil; however it's paced much better than any of the others...but it on DVD if you still can..you won't be sorry!,1101859200,7,377,4.236111111111111

240360,5,6300209296,"No, there's no Dr. Sivana, Captain Marvel Jr., Mary Marvel or even Uncle Marvel...but you do have the prototype for which all superhero movies should be judged.  The origin is actually pretty close to the well-known comic origin, with the old wizard SHAZAM, just in a different setting. I grew up watching the CBS SHAZAM! series in the '70's, and actually loved it.  But this blows that series away by a mile.  The flying scenes, by today's standards, are mediocre...but for someone seeing this in a theatre in 1941, groundbreaking would not begin to describe them.  This Cap isn't afraid to get rough with the badguys, and will even use a machine gun when necessary!  If you love serials, superheroes, cliffhangers or Captain Marvel, you gotta get this!",1086220800,14,754,4.859375
240361,4,6300209296,"Throughout the 1930s and '40s, Republic Pictures created some  of the finest serials in movie history. ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" (1941) ranks among the studio's top chapterplays - and it's yours for roughly $1 per chapter. Tom Tyler is ideally cast as ""The World's Mightiest Mortal,"" who battles the evil Scorpion for 12 exciting episodes. The special effects by the Lydecker brothers are terrific - not to mention the high-flying stunt work from David Sharpe (he's a bit shorter than Tyler, but who cares). The Republic DVD features excellent 35mm prints and the rarely-seen theatrical trailer. ""Captain Marvel"" may not surpass the thrill-a-minute exploits of ""Spy Smasher"" (1942), but it comes close.",1085356800,11,707,5.3125
240362,5,6300209296,"I had heard that ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" was very good, and I wasn't disappointed. The basic story is cleverly tailored to provide situations for cliffhangers, some of which are a bit weak, but most are very good. But the most impressive are the production values and the special effects. As has already been noted, the flying effects were a match to anything before ""Superman"" in 1978, and infinitely superior to those of the ""Superman"" TV series with George Reeves. But that's not all: a sequence on a ship during a storm very cleverly combined rear-screen projection with live-action ""waves"". As Captain Marvel, Tom Tyler has a real presence and is one of the most convincing superhero incarnations. On the other hand, his acting wasn't that good. The other actors were ok.
Objectively speaking, the violence is nothing by today's standards, but I was shocked at some of Captain Marvel's actions, especially when he deliberately throws a baddie off the top of a tall building. This is somehow refreshing.
There are a few plot inconsistencies and continuity errors (at least once, Billy Batson is wearing one set of clothes when he changes into Captain Marvel, and a different one when he changes back). Moreover, the authors seemed to think that Siam - modern Thailand - was a British colony, which it wasn't.
But that is of little consequence. I can only recommend this serial.",1082678400,2,1392,4.927659574468085
240363,5,6300209296,"As a fan of the old Saturday morning show ""Shazam!"", but not familiar with the comic book Captain Marvel, I was eagerly looking forward to this serial.  Many sources say this is the best serial ever made.  I think ""best"" is a bit strong, but it is definitely one of the better ones I've seen.  Lots of action and good cliffhangers.  A warning, though.  If you're expecting the same All-American goody-two-shoes hero as was on ""Shazam!"", you'll be disappointed.  The Captain Marvel in this serial is quite stoic, and, dare I say, a bit mean.  In various scenes, he does the following: uses a machine gun to mow down a bunch of Arabs; throws a bad guy off a bridge; throws another bad guy off a tall building; and threatens to throw a third criminal onto a bed of nails while trying to get some information out of him.  I liked the flying effects, especially when compared to that used in the later ""Superman"" serials (1948 and 1950).  In those, cartoon animation was used to depict the Man of Steel flying.  Not so for Captain Marvel.  Two devices are used.  First is the standard of filming the actor against a background screen (think the 1950s ""Superman"" TV show).  The second technique involves what looks like a full-sized dummy flying along on a guide wire.  But it's quite difficult to see the wire.  I thought this was an excellent technique to simulate flight.  Overall, I highly recommend this serial.  You won't be disappointed.",1079913600,4,1438,4.642857142857143
240364,5,6300209296,"This is not only one of the best cliffhanger serials ever made but it also stands up well today as great escapist entertainment. The flying effects are still impressive and the fight scenes and action setpieces are well handled. The acting is nothing to write home about, but Tom Tyler makes for an impressive looking Captain Marvel. He's also terrific in the fight scenes.
It's worth noting that this has not been completely remastered for DVD, despite the claims in other reviews. The picture looks fine but the audio is slightly distorted. There is no difference between this release and the video version released by Republic about 10 years ago. I have added this to the review because there may be people who are expecting pristine video and audio quality due to the remastering claims made here. Don't let my comments put you off though...what is on offer here is perfectly acceptable considering the age of the source material.
If you're a fan of super-heroes or just a lover of old fashioned Hollywood knockabout action flicks, this will have you grinning ear to ear. It's even better if you watch one episode a week, preferably on Saturday mornings!",1078099200,7,1158,4.853535353535354

Also, we learn of the origin of Captain Marvel, his superpowers and his assigned duties.
Republic Pictures has ace special effects in Marvels flying sequences. This serial was the first serial to introduce comic book super hereos to the silver screen.

240450,5,6300209296,"The Big Red Cheese never looked better - this DVD release of the 12-episode serial, ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" is truly excellent. While remembering that this is a 1940s-era serial, the overall production values are remarkably high. Much has already been said about the flying effects, which are surprisingly good - a full-size dummy was used in daylight photography to make a truly realistic-looking effect, even with other moving subjects in the frame. The action is strong, and Cap reminds you that (1) this was made in the 40's, and is quite a bit more brutal than the PC adventures of Superman, and (2) he really was a kid, and seemed to actually enjoy the action! The secrecy of the identity of the Scorpion was maintained well throughout the serial, as they constantly tried to redirect suspicion throughout the group of scientists. One final question: just what was Whitey's role in all this? Answer for yourself when viewing this terrific serial!",1072396800,4,963,4.950617283950617
240451,4,6300209296,"It's been many years since I've seen these and of course that was on video so I have no idea how good the DVD looks.  For history, Captain Marvel was Fawcett Comic's answer to Superman.  So much so that DC comics eventually sued Fawcett and forced them to stop publishing captain Marvel.
Ironically, in the mid-70s DC would get the rights to the character but would have to title the comic ""Shazam"" as marvel comics had their own Captain marvel character and owned the rights.
Anyway, the usual cliffhanging episodes ending and better than you'd expect special effects.",1071619200,3,569,4.795918367346939

It has decent special effects and a fine story. A classic desert adventure, including angry horde, offended god, and stalwart hero. The flying sequences are well done. The cliff hangers are appropriately dramatic. The Scorpion is a nice serial villain, complete with hooded face and ultimate weapon, and Captain Marvel remains my favorite hero.
If you like serials or Captain Marvel you really can't go wrong with this.",1068422400,98,611,5.244897959183674
240453,5,6300209296,"My father bought this serial for me on videotape many years ago. He knew I was a devoted fan of Shazam, the now-laughable Saturday morning live-action program that aired on CBS for a few years.
The serial changed my appreciation for Captain Marvel and introduced me to the concept of the cliffhanger. It is, quite simply, the best of the old Matinee Serials.  I was thrilled when I found a fresh copy on tape through Amazon a few years ago.
The effects for the early 40s are quite good, even after watching them again in 2002, some 22 years after seeing it for the first time. A warning to parents, though: Violence is quite rampant; the Cap'n doesn't think twice about belting the bad guy or even picking up a machine gun to finish the job.
Highly recommended, though, for anyone who's a fan of Shazam, comic books or cinema from the period. Top notch.",1048982400,17,853,4.503225806451613
240454,4,6300209296,"It's not exactly like the 40's comics but the costume of Marvel is how he looked in the early comic books and very well done as is the Scorpion's costume. Tom Tyler was the perfect choice for Cap who later was THE PHANTOM, the Batman like character (and likely one of the inspirations for Batman) the purple tights clad jungle hero in another serial. The use of a 'flying' mannequin ala Commander Cody's flying effects were first used in this serial which look pretty effective most of the time compared to the Kirk Alyn SUPERMAN serials cartooned figure flying. This is the one source to see Marvel wreak havok on the villains....This Cap doesn't sissy around with the punishment! In the serial, teen Billy Batson is given the power to become Captain Marvel for the sole purpose of guarding and keeping out of the hands of the evil, the awesome SCORPION statue, an ancient relic that can be used to produce gold and create death rays, etc.! Jackson Bostwick and Jon Davey may've delivered a more easy feel as a Cap who's been at fighting evil for awhile in the 70's SHAZAM! tv series but Tyler is pretty good as a Cap who discovers his powers on the job. Non super hero buffs or those who only want modern blockbuster effects can forget this serial but if you're into classic versions of Tarzan, Superman, Batman, THE SHADOW and THE GREEN HORNET, this is a real gem.",1024531200,6,1367,4.560975609756097

Captain Marvel wasn't as elaborately done with the flying sequences as the Superman serials, wich had a blend of live action and animation, but the spirit is still there.",1021248000,2,472,4.839506172839506
240456,5,6300209296,"Captain Marvel makes a great platform for a writing program in elementary school. A child from 1941 is a lot like a child from 2002. What excited an elementary school child in 1941 still excites the 2002 elementary school child. Captain Marvel is an interesting topic for 4th, 5th, and 6th graders to write about, and it is a lot more fun to write when the topic is of interest to the writer.

 I've used Captain Marvel as a basis for a good portion of my writing program for the past several years. We watch and discuss segments of the episodes, perhaps 5 minutes, what ever is appropriate to the story line and writing assignment, then the students write. At various times students write narratives in the first or third person, telling the story from the different perspectives' of the characters. They write news stories, telling what happened in a given segment as it would be written in a newspaper. They write obituaries for characters that are killed, filling in the unknown details of the characters lives' from evidence of their actions in the story. They write persuasive essays and editorials commenting on the actions of Captain Marvel and the other characters, and on the identity of the Scorpion. They write parallel stories that have the same plot or story line as a particular Captain Marvel story segment. They even write poetry about Captain Marvel.

 On our weekly writing day several mothers come into the class to help. We start out by returning the students' writing portfolios so they can read the comments and grade on last week's assignment. Using an overhead projector I show the class two or three examples of good writing from last week, pointing out the specific elements that made that writing good.

 Then I tell the class what their assignment will be this week: first person narrative, obituary, news story, etc. We usually work on one specific genra several weeks in a row, then revisit it later in the year. We watch the episode segment, discuss it, and watch the same segment again; then the students write about it. The mother helpers and I assist students as needed. Students spend anywhere from an hour to three days on their work, writing and re-writing.

 There are a lot of other opportunities to write in school in literature, social studies, science, personal journals, math, and the like, but as a basis for teaching the basics of writing, this serial of Captain Marvel has outstanding potential.",1014681600,6,2442,4.8253588516746415

Captain Marvel battles the mysterous Scorpion and his evil henchmen as they attempt to steal six optical lenses that transforms common stones into precious gold.
I won't ruin the climax of this wonderful cliffhanger by removing the hood from the Scorpion in this review... But, I will hint that while great thinks are generally portrayed puffing on their smoking pipes, evil villians commonly smoke an awful lot of stinky cigarettes!

I even used to wish that later Superman tv and serials were more like this. Where as Suppie used to just stand there and let the bullets bounce off him, Captain Marvel would get teed off and after succesfully beating them up reall well would actually throw the bad guys out of rooftops and even mountain sides. Now that's crime & punishment! That was probably one of my favorite  scenes! Tom Tyler was also  the first Phantom(that's Ghost who Walks for you interns!)in that succesful serial. I originally bought my video years ago when they were quite expensive. This Amazon price gives you no excuse. It's a must. Considereing the time period the special effects are excellent.

The plot and dialouge is simplistic.  But the budget and the period of time it was produced, you will be well served.
Good punch-ups! and mandatory cliff hangers still got me shouting now nearly thirty years on!.
Money well spent.",985478400,,732,4.5227272727272725
240523,5,6300209296,Great example of what cliffhangers are supposed to be.  Billy Batson could not possibly have been portrayed any better.  Interesting story line and plot.  Creative action sequences and a sinister villian who is a well kept secret until the very last moment.  This was both engaging and fun to watch.  I thought I was reading the original comic books.  Definintely worth adding to your collection.,983577600,2,396,5.015384615384615
240524,5,6300209296,"If you've never seen one of these old ""chapter plays"" or ""movie serials"" from the Golden Age of the 30s and 40s, then this is the one to start with. Great cast, wonderful special effects of Captain Marvel flying through the air, outstanding production values--something rare, and increasingly more rare as the 40s came to an end. Tom Tyler is perfect as the steely-eyed marvel of a hero, although David Sharpe stunted for him. The real tragedy in watching Tyler as Marvel is that within a few years, he was barely able to move or shuffle his feet because of acute rhumotoid arthritis. His portrayal of Kharis the Mummy is a horrifying harbinger of how he would actually become in real life. Louise Currie is the feisty heroine and Douglas Coughlin is perfect as the wide-eyed, earnest Billy Batson, who becomes Captain Marvel by simply uttering ""Shazam!"" After you've watched this serial classic, you'll have to check out ""Spy Smasher,"" ""G-Men Vs. the Black Dragon,"" ""King of the Texas Rangers"" and ""Manhunt in the African Jungles."" Oh, nearly forgot, another great goodie: Daredevils of the Red Circle. Watch and thrill to these marvels of yesteryear!",979603200,15,1152,4.912820512820513
240525,5,6300209296,"Movie serials were written for youngsters but, as screenwriter Barry Shipman observed, this was not a putdown: ""No, it's for the 12-year-old in all of us."" Republic did them best, and ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" is one of Republic's best (some say THE best). The flying superhero is based on a 1940s to 1950s comic book character, who went out of business after being sued by DC, the publishers of Superman, as a ripoff (in more recent years, he has been acquired and revived by DC; go figure). DC had a chance to have Superman serialized at Republic, but passed (the script was revised to become ""The Mysterious Dr. Satan"" with a non-super hero); Superman serials later came from Columbia with cartoon flying sequences. When the promoters of the Chris Reeve/Superman movie said it would be the first time audiences would believe a man could fly, they obviously hadn't seen the Captain Marvel serial.",978048000,72,903,4.87012987012987
240526,5,6300209296,"Shazam!  Tom Tyler stars in what is regarded by most as the best serial ever made.  If you love cliffhangers, this has to be in your collection.  If you're only a casual fan of serials, this is the one to own.  Released  by Republic in 1941, the story follows Billy Batson played by Frank  Coughlin, Jr as he battles evil forces to prevent the Octopus from  obtaining the necessary lenses to create a weapon of mass destruction.  He  wonders into a hidden room where is is given the power to turn into Captain  Marvel at will by uttering the word, Shazam!  Sometimes you'll wonder why  he doesn't use the power, but you have to have cliffhangers in a serial.  The interesting thing to me about Captain Marvel is he's one of the only  super heroes I can remember who is downright brutal.  At one point, he  grabs a machine gun and mows down some arabs as they flee, laughing with a  gleem in his eye.  In another scene he throws a guy angrily off a building  to scare his associate into talking.  I loved it!  An indestructable guy  who actually kills his opponents. It's a great story, wonderful cast, and  non-stop action.  The only thing you'll hate is that there isn't a sequel  so you can have more!",956275200,7,1203,4.408256880733945

7805714,5,6300209296,This video is GREAT! I just love the old classic stuff. The special effects are actually better than the ones in the 50s Superman series. I always like to watch a chapter of this show before my movie.,1521158400,,200,4.2894736842105265
7805715,4,6300209296,"The ho-hum plot and cliffhangers didn't hold much interest for me, but the flying special effects were clever and predate the Superman TV series by a decade. Those are what kept me watching this sometimes tedious serial. I paused and replayed many times to figure out the inventive flying sequences. Not much visible difference between the blu-ray and regular DVD versions so save your money and buy the DVD.",1518307200,,408,4.927536231884058
7805716,3,6300209296,"The Adventures of Captain Marvel is an entertaining adventure movie with a fun and thrilling main story arch. Evaluating this superhero adventure partly depends on the expectations the viewer holds: as a series of short movies the plot is a blast  if dated in execution; as a single movie, it has a repetitive structure and several tedious moments, as well as bland, almost interchangeable characters. However, as this serial sports a more ingenuous superhero plot than most of todays offerings, it does have its charm.
Overall 6/10
