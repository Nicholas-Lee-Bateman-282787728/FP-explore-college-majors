5660209,5,B00BNH9NNE,"I love this movie!  It was put together very well; recounting how one town, in it's death throes in the dust bowl, dies and moves on to Oregon to restart their beloved town.  It also intertwines the story of a physician and his daughter, refugees because of the Natzis, come to America to start over.  Moving from their plush existence to this town in the dust bowl is quite a shock.  I highly recommend it!",1405036800,2,407,4.386666666666667
5660210,4,B00BNH9NNE,"Olive Films' 2013 release of 'Three Faces West' (Republic, 1940), while showing some age-related artifacts, offers a cleaner, steadier picture and vastly improved audio track compared with Artisan's 2004 version, which was watchable but hampered by occasional image flicker, lots of specks and scratches and poor sound throughout.  The film itself is a charming John Wayne vehicle-- a topical, gently propagandistic dust-bowl drama/romance openly informed by the then-apparent Nazi threat-- co-starring the loveable Charles Coburn and lovely Sigrid Gurie.  Enjoyable, overlooked slice of Americana also exhibits Wayne's maturing acting skills.  No extras.  Movie rates 3 1/2 stars, as does presentation.",1401494400,3,703,6.0
5660211,5,B00BNH9NNE,Three Faces West.  It's a John Wayne movie.  Need we say anything else.  Three Faces West is a good old fashioned story worth watching.,1390176000,,135,4.541666666666667
5660212,2,B00BNH9NNE,"All these BR releases from Olive Films have been way over priced for simple 57 minute films.  They must be using a quick remastering program since they are shoving these out at an alarming rate.  Almost 25 BR releases in less than a year, with nearly all of them are less then 60 minute films and costing $20 - $25 each.  This film might be a bit longer but that's just uncalled for.  They could have made money at half the cost.",1370995200,7,429,4.195121951219512

8571661,3,B00BNH9NNE,"This is an interesting Wayne vehicle on the heels of his breakout in Stagecoach. A dust bowl story with the outbreak of war in the background sets the stage for Wayne to be the hard boiled hero he would play countless times through the next 2 decades. Charles Coburn is delightful,  but I can't say the same for Sigurd Girlie who's performance is wooden (reminds me of Valli in Miracle of the Bells).
I like this film because of the story. It's a B version of the Grapes of Wrath... not much depth. It's a good story for Wayne to solidify the screen persona he would be known foe in the 1940s: strong, moral, rugged, salt of the earth hero.",1490400000,,640,4.333333333333333

8571664,4,B00BNH9NNE,"It's John Wayne so can't go wrong.  Story about Dust Bowl period in Oklahoma and how people dealt with losing their land and soil to the wind.  All this on top of the Depression.  Kind of a B movie, but still a great story.",1488758400,,223,4.0227272727272725
