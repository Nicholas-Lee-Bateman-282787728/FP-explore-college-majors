8310969,5,B001IHNX62,"Never Die Alone 2004 rating 4 stars

I never heard much about this movie and when I saw the trailer, I immediately thought it was another shoot em up bang bang fest and ignored it. 3 years later I decided to see it and was pleasantly surprised. The movie was a lot smarter than I thought it would be.

King David(DMX) gets released from jail and wants to make things right but things doesnt go as planned. He is stabbed and is taken to a hospital by a reporter named Paul(played by David Arquette) where he perishes. Paul is intrigued by King David and through the tapes that King David has made himself, tries to piece together the events that lead to his death.

DMX is awesome as King David. He is a ruthless and arrogant sleazeball that does things his way no matter the consequences. Michael Ealy is great as Michael, the son of Edna(Keesha Sharp)who is out for revenge for what David did to his mother. Clifton Powell as well as Reagan Gomez Preston and Aisha Tyler contribute some solid performances to the film also. Even though the gunfights look like something out of a Quentin Tarantino flick, the movie is still a good tale about the age old adage, you reap what you sow. Never Die Alone is underrated and definitely deserves a look.

Sugar Hill 1994. Rating 5 stars.

I have always loved this film and will always love this film till my dying days. It reminds me of a time when Black cinema broke the mold with the stories that were told and how those stories were told. Sugar Hill is a well written and well acted tale film noir drama that never got the respect it truly deserves.

Roemello(Wesley Snipes) wants to break free from a world of crime but is constantly dragged back in. He cant live a normal life or have a girlfriend in it because something bad is always happening around him. His brother Raynathan(Michael Wright) is very high-strung and causes some of Roemello's problems plus he has to deal with his drug-addicted father A.R.(Clarence Williams III).

Wesley Snipes best performance is Roemello Skuggs. This movie proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wesley can act as well as play a serious role. Michael Wright is good as Raynathan even though he can get buckwild at times. Clarence Williams III is excellent as their drug-afflicted father A.R. He was always a great actor that never got enough credit for great roles such as this one, Hoodlum and Deep Cover. Theresa Randle is is pretty good as Roemello's girlfriend Melissa. She is innocent in the sense that she is not numb to death and violence and actually feels pain upon seeing something like for instance a dead body. Melissa is gorgeous as well as likable. There are also some strong performances by Abe Vigoda and Ernie Hudson.

I love the setting of the movie as well as the cinematography. Director Leon Ichaso has an eye for things and you can see that as you watch this movie. Its a shame that the movie didn't do well and the director never did another movie again. I would have liked to see another movie from him.

In short Sugar Hill is an underrated masterpiece. No self-respecting fan of Black Cinema should be without a copy of Sugar Hill and Never Die Alone. Never Die Alone is in both Full Screen and Widescreen and has a few special features. Sugar Hill is only in Widescreen and has very little special features. If you are a fan of both movies this deal should be great for you.",1244505600,,3390,4.526143790849673
