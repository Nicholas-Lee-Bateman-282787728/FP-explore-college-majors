7924980,5,B00004WC60,"Lucky Luke: Volume 1: Mr. Joseph
This is the first in the series where Lucky Luke gets involved in a land feud between the farmers and the ranchers and of course both claim to have a deed to the land. As Lucky investigates the situation he finds out that Mr. Joseph is attempting to sell weapons to both sides and further investigation Lucky Luke discovers that Mr. Joseph is Joe Dalton.
The picture quality of the DVD and the music is excellent.
Be careful, the DVD appears to have no regional code (as stated on the cover) - it plays fine on my non-regional DVD player but will not play on my older one.",1010880000,11,605,4.315789473684211
