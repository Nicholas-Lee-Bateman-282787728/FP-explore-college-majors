Expecting a comedy as the movie is billed now and at the time, I didn't find much humor in the story.  Aubrey Piper (Ford Sterling) is a constantly bellowing, bragging blowhard who is a clerk in a room filled with clerks.  He tells everyone outside his job that he is an executive for the Pennsylvania Railroad.  His girlfriend, Amy Fisher (Lois Wilson) believes in all his bluster and accepts his marriage proposal.  Her parents (Charles Goodrich and Claire McDowell) don't care for the guy as he is constantly becoming too familiar with their home.  They see through his buffoonery.

Amy's brother Joe (Gregory Kelly) is a bit more accepting of Aubrey, but mostly because of his sister.  Joe has eyes for his next door neighbor Clara (Brooks) and she is a favorite of the rest of the family as well being Amy's best friend.  Aubrey's idiotic behavior gets him in trouble with the law due to a traffic mishap.  I guess this is the funny part as he drives a car for the first time.  He's convicted and must spend 6 months in jail or pay a $1000 fine, which the judge upped from $500 when Aubrey tried bluffing him.

Pop Fisher had decided earlier to give son Joe a $1000 to help him sell his new invention (rustproof paint).  The money had originally been set aside to pay off the past due mortgage.  Joe decides to pay Aubrey's fine instead, at the risk of losing the family home.  (Note:  Everyone in the film seems to have a problem with financial priorities.)  Subsequently Aubrey demurs from his usual bellicose ways and decides to help Joe with his product.  When push comes to shove, Aubrey can be very persuasive and in the end, gets a commitment from a large company along with a large check.  In short, he saves the day.

Brooks has limited screen time but makes the most of it.  In one key scene, she gets into it with Aubrey and tells him off.  A woman being this aggressive was a bit off-putting at the time but got her noticed by critics and other filmmakers.  The film is transferred to DVD by Image Entertainment and looks very good.  Most scenes are clear and crisp.  A few do show some film sprocket bleed through and others are a bit faded.  Still very watchable.  The audio track is new music recreated to replicate the sound of the era.  It comes in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono and is also excellent.",1404086400,,2410,4.490783410138249

7880165,4,6304980760,"Director Malcolm St. Clair's adaptation of the George Kelly stageplay THE SHOW-OFF is actually a Ford Sterling vehicle, despite cover art depicting Louise Brooks, who here portrays the girlfriend of a secondary character.

Sterling is best known as Chief of Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. In this story he's the bragadocious J. Aubrey Piper, a carnation-wearing railroad clerk claiming to be a wealthy company big shot. Aubrey proposes to Amy Fisher (Wilson), which displeases her parents who are little-impressed with him, as they've been told the truth about their future son-in-law's lowly position and net worth. The two marry anyway, and spendthrift Aubrey is unable to support his bride on a clerk's pay.

After he wins a car in a raffle, Aubrey (who doesn't know how to operate it) causes several accidents by driving on the wrong side of the road. In the process of crashing the auto, Aubrey pins a traffic cop against a wall. In court he's unable to pay a $1,000 fine, so his brother Joe (Kelly) helps out, which causes a whole new set of problems.

7880166,4,6304980760,"It's hard not to give a movie with Louise Brooks 5 stars, but this just isn't her best vehicle. In fact she only has a supporting role. But anything with Louise's smile is worth watching. If you don't own Pandoria's Box get it first, this is masterpiece. Other Louise Brooks are hard to find but can be worth the effort. Beggar's of Life is a point in example. Nut if you have Pandor's Box get this, it's worth it.",996192000,5,414,4.253164556962025
