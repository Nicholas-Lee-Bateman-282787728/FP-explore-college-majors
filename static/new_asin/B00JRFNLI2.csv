8653571,3,B00JRFNLI2,"This one gets off to kind of a slow start with a lot of time spent on character development that is ultimately unnecessary.  Stick with it though; once the stage is set for the denouement, the pace picks up and the movie gets quite interesting and ultimately redeems itself as worth the time invested.  Another plus is that hands rarely get overplayed (other than Steiner doing a fairly standard cold, sociopathic nazi schtick with the self-caricaturing accent and unlimited capacity for debauchery), and the more brutal points are made without much in the way of gratuitous gore.  The movie survives - just - by the writing and performances.  You should be able to pick this up for a lot less than the price indicated here; it's been released in a grindhouse/midnight movie series that I am pretty sure is available on Amazon as well.",1483315200,,835,4.777777777777778
8653572,3,B00JRFNLI2,I bought it as a gift. Feedback is satisfactory. No details.,1468627200,,60,4.545454545454546
8653573,4,B00JRFNLI2,"Not an easy movie to watch, though it is helped that John Steiner is obviously not giving two craps about the movie and or his performance. As obvious by his interview on the disk which clearly gives away his opinion of the movie being less than stellar. Rino De Silvestro  who passed away in 2009 gives a interview on here which is typical of one of his interviews on a disk, if you've seen his interview on Hanna D's disk you will get knocked over by the nearly crazy pretentiousness seeping off the man.

He honestly rambles on and on about the stuff he researched for the production of this movie in detail to strive to be realistic. And honestly thinks he's out to create works of art. I don't even remember Lucio Fulci having this much delusional ego problems. This type of interview makes one pang for the earnest Claudio Fargasso interviews I've watched or Bruno Mattei ones.

The movie in itself, is a rather Ok Nazi movie from Italy in the mid-70s, it's not as grim or serious as say Gestapo's Last Orgy or Women's Camp 119, but it's not nearly as goofy as SS Hell Camp or SS Girls.

And it's sure as not like The Night Porter, Salo, Salon Kitty etc.

But both interviews on the DVD from the Director and Star are funny, because they present polar opposite opinions on the film in both outrageously over the top ways.

The other interview is one I steered clear of,  a rather boring ""expert"" on these type of movies with a thick German Accent begins to speak at length about these type of movies and it can't get any more boring than this folks, he does this same schtick on the Intervision Gestapo's Last Orgy DVD.

On the plus side this transfer restores the original opening credits that was missing on my previous DVD version from Full Moon's Grindhouse line which just had a Computer Generated title in English at the start and nothing more. These titles though are obviously sourced from a VHS, so yeah the quality's not great. But at least it's there.

As for the movie it's not special, the T&A is there but you probably won't feel especially turned on by it, and right so, But it's better than Achtung! The Desert Tigers, that's for sure.",1460419200,2,2157,4.468193384223919
8653574,5,B00JRFNLI2,"This is a comment about the 'Full Moon Grindhouse' edition dvd.  This distributor has managed to find an extremely nice print of a rare title. The picture is sharp, and the colors are bright and saturated. This cannot be said of the double bill dvd that was released by some other label a while back. It should be mentioned that the picture has been stretched to mimic a 2;35 aspect ratio, which is not correct. But this can be remedied with current flatscreen tv's. First you have to change the picture from ""widescreen"" to ""normal"" 4x3 picture. That takes care of the stretching. Then, because the picture is smaller than the tv frame, you must select the ""zoom"" option. This will give you a perfect, correct picture. The audio is somewhat weak, so you will have to turn up the volume. But this is very good quality for such an obscure title. Also the running time is not 98 minutes as stated, but just under 92 minutes, but I believe there are no scenes missing. As far as the movie goes, ""Deported Women"" is one of the absolute best in the genre, with it's high production values, beautiful sets and costumes, and hairstyles correct to the 1940's. We have a great, slow burn revenge tale, filled with interesting mind games between one prisoner and a very sinister SS Captain. Unlike a lot of the other nazisploitation junk, this one is not seedy and disgusting. It is a real, legitimate film that is surprisingly well-made. I like this dvd label, and I'm planning to buy ""Thor the Conqueror"" from Full Moon next.",1439337600,3,1517,4.597785977859779
