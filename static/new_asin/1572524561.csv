7797608,5,1572524561,"Two dysfunctional, codependent couples collide at hilariously uncomfortable dinner.  Despite their inability to truly see and communicate with each other, their masks come off, the potential for making genuine connections and positive change arises, only to crumble due to their inertia, insecurity, and fear.

This is one of my favorite films.  I just watched it for the second time, after not seeing it for fifteen years, and loved it every bit as much as the first time I saw it.  Noonan's ""What Happened Was"" is also excellent.

I really wish Noonan had written and directed more.  His films are just too bleak, his view of human nature too dark, his humor too black for most -- but I love them for those very qualities.",1523836800,,724,4.798387096774194
7797609,5,1572524561,We need more Tom Noonan's writing and making films.  Make more Mr. Noonan.,1503100800,,74,4.6923076923076925
7797610,5,1572524561,"I saw this film at Sundance in the early 90s and loved it. (I think it was called ""Wifey"" at the festival.) Tom Noonan is one of my favorite filmmakers and actors, and, of course, Wallace Shawn -- well, what can you say? He's a national treasure. This film is talky and interesting, delving into the deepest fears and desires that lie within us all. Check it out.",1452816000,2,363,4.352941176470588
7797611,5,1572524561,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff meets My Dinner with Andre, this movie is not only funny and savage and insightful but dares to chart territory that Woody Allen can only dream about.",1439078400,2,181,4.6875
7797612,5,1572524561,"Another great work by Noonan that makes you wonder why he doesn't make more films and why more people don't realize he's a filmmaker in addition to one of our prime character actors. Some terrific acting from some of our greatest ""other"" character actors and cinematography, editing, stylization that is unique in a film that is essentially a play. Kudos to Noonan and Shawn; what a team!",1387756800,3,388,4.8059701492537314
7797613,3,1572524561,"The acting is actually good, it's just a slow play. I had to watch it for an assignment which was not based on the content, rather on the situation. Reminded me of a Woody Allen play.",1353974400,,183,4.111111111111111
7797614,5,1572524561,"An extremely dark, cynical comedy that takes place in the house of a husband-wife psychotherapist team. The cast consists of 4 people: the therapists, the husband's patient, and the patient's girlfriend.

The dialogue and acting are superb, and the cast is perfect.

There have been several spin-offs of the classic ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", but do not let that deter you.  This film is at least as good, and in many ways better, as it is much more cerebral and subtle.",1126915200,5,478,4.804878048780488
7797615,5,1572524561,"Tom Noonan and Shawn Wallace, of My Dinner with Andre fame, give exemplary performances as a new age 'authentic' therapist and a new age wreck respectively. When Wallace's character shows up unexpectedly, with his wife, at the therapists home the results are startling and sweet but not unexpected. This movie unfolds with a subtle brilliance and pace that is not often seen in American productions.
The Wife is well worth the rental but it is unlikely that the chain video stores will have it as a part of their collections. You might have to borrow it from a friend or buy it. Sadly the DVD is very sparse and has few extras but that shouldn't deter you from seeing it.
It is a great accompaniment to a winter's dinner of penne in a light clam sauce with a bottle of merlot slightly chilled. For dessert a rice pudding would be appropriate.",1032739200,7,842,4.582781456953643
7797616,4,1572524561,"I love this movie.  Like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", this film slowly squeezes the viewer into a bottle-neck of engrossing yet terribly embarassing dramatic situations.  At times I found it difficult to  breathe while watching this film.  It's also very beautifully photographed.  However, the DVD transfer is terrible.  Mottled artifacts of the MPG (DVD)  encoding process can be seen swarming in the shadows, and still-life scenes  look frozen and slightly odd.  Not recommended.  The VHS tape on a good VCR  is better, since the film was released widescreen on VHS.  They should pull  the DVD and re-release with a better transfer.",957571200,10,640,5.1568627450980395
7797617,4,1572524561,"If only the Hollywood mainstream would make movies with real emotions instead of the lowest-common-denominator hack that is designed for financially safe mass-market appeal; The Wife has only four characters, but  a world of complexity is revealed in the interactions and private emotional  conflicts of these two couples over an impromptu dinner ""party"".",955584000,3,355,5.679245283018868
