744002,1,6303935214,"This is a solid WWII film that displays what the 442nd Regimental Combat Team went through both before and during the war. The other reviews do a fine job of summarizing this film. I am merely posting to warn others of the horrible Alpha Video transfer of this film. My copy is washed out to the point that it is difficult in some scenes to tell what is on screen. The audio is horrible. And this brand new DVD stutters and locks up in one key part of the movie. This happened repeatedly so that there was one section of the movie I never was able to watch. And it happened on a DVD player that has never had any DVD skip or stop before this one came along.

I've viewed many, many old films from this time frame and I realize that the transfers are never going to compete with a current release. However, this one is unbelievably bad and in my opinion it should be pulled from the shelves.

So if you are interested, please do check out this fine movie. But by all means stay away from the Alpha Video version of this film. I'm hoping the VCI video transfer of this film is better...then again, it would take a determined effort for it to be any worse.",1204416000,9,1153,4.212669683257919
744003,4,6303935214,"The contribution of minority ethnic fighting units to victory in World War 2 has long been a neglected aspect of the war movie -and to a lesser extent ,historical scholarship also. In my native UK the role of ,say ,Indian and Caribbean regiments has only recently received due attention from historians and has been wholly ignored by film makers .
Go For Broke is in many respects an utterly conventional war picture of its era. It deals with the training of a group of volunteers -their basic fitness,instruction in armaments and military culture .The usual parade ground and training camp cliches are all present and correct .The battle scenes -set in Italy and France -see the progress of the unit from raw recruits to battle hardened and decorated soldiers .Some survive and others die .So far so routine .
However what sets the movie apart is that it looks at a Nisei (Japanese -American )regiment the 442 Combat Team -the most decorated fighting troops in the US army in the whole war .It deals with the resistance and scepticism they faced -including initially their own commander (Van Johnson)-and sets out the background very clearly .Many of their families are in internment camps and still face open hostility on the home front .In a very real sense they are fighting for their families as much as for their comrades in arms -fighting to secure a stake in their post war nation .

In execution this is fairly routine .In conception it is worthwhile and brave  and redresses a neglect of these loyal and courageous men who made a major contribution to victory

The movie is well worth seeing as a piece of history and a reasonably exciting war movie with some decent battle scenes",1199836800,,1690,4.761092150170649
744004,5,6303935214,"A BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK made me curious about the Hollywood take of the Japanese-American GI experience of World War II.  That curiosity led directly to this film which was also produced by Dore Schary.  It's a remarkably satisfying prequel to the later film that I reccommend highly for its rich characterization, and the fine demonstration of ensemble-storytelling presented by writer/director Robert Pirosh.  Despite the absence of special features, this one absolutely rocks!  I was deeply  moved by the most unobtrusive, naturalistic, gentle propaganda I've ever had the priviledge and pleasure to watch.",1172707200,,609,5.4361702127659575

744006,4,6303935214,Go for Broke (a Hawaiian gambling term for betting it all) is an excellent movie. Having met George Oiye a decorated member of the 442nd and read his book Footprints in my Rearview Mirror I am pleased to see a movie presenting a little known chapter in our country's history and exposing perhaps one of our most shining examples of heroism and patriotism in the face of ignorance and predjudice. I was excited to see some of the things I had read about re-enacted in the movie. For futher info on the 442nd check out your local library or read  Footprints in my Rearview Mirror especally chapter 5 where Mr Oiye recounts his war experiences.,1143936000,3,641,4.573913043478261
744007,5,6303935214,"Based on the real story of the 442 infantry division,this movie delivers the japanese-american story of how much hatered they had to fight to prove themselves to their country and the enemies of their time!

744008,5,6303935214,"This movie is about the U.S. 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. We follow the unit from its formation in 1943, through boot camp and finally to the battlefields of Italy and France.

It is a good war film typical of those filmed of the time. The one difference is, this unit was formed of Japanese-Americans. The soldiers were volunteers, and many had their family placed into internment camps by the U.S. Govt. The movie does not only a good job of depicting their heroism in war and the face discrimination in their own country. But also how the individual soldiers dealt with their families being interred. They fought not just for America and the liberation of Europe, but for family honor.",1140393600,8,709,4.717741935483871
744009,4,6303935214,"GO FOR BROKE! (1951) is a typical war movie in many respects.  It chronicles the story of one regiment - the U.S. 442nd Regimental Combat Team - from its formation in 1943, through boot camp and finally to the battlefields of Italy and France.  The twist is that the regiment is comprised of Japanese-American volunteers, Nisei, or second-generation Japanese-Americans. The men are commanded by a typically (for the day) prejudiced soldier, Lt. Mike Grayson (Van Johnson).
  Anyone familiar with combat war movies will find the familiar in GO FOR BROKE!  The unit goes from green and raw to tough and cohesive.  They adopt a pet (a pig, in this case), distribute k-rations to the hungry citizens of liberated towns and cluster around for mail call.  The difference is that children seem a little fearful of the foreign looking foreigners, and many of the letters from home are written from internment camps.  The movie dedicates itself to proving the regiment's prowess as soldiers and showing how Grayson's prejudice slowly erodes as his respect for his men grow.
  GO FOR BROKE! opens with an except from a proclamation from President Roosevelt announcing the formation of the 442nd - ""Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry.""  Featuring many 442nd veterans in the movie it has a layer of reality that most war movies lack, and it doesn't flinch from displaying the bitterness felt by some of the soldiers.  In many ways it's similar to the Civil War movie GLORY, the movie about the Massachusetts 54th Colored Regiment starring Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington.  The production values aren't as high in this one, although the combat sequences are well done, and the acting talents isn't nearly of the caliber of GLORY, but GO FOR BROKE! touches the same themes, and GLORY can't touch the verisimilitude GO FOR BROKE! and its army veteran actors achieve.  The Pro-Active dvd I'm reviewing is a bit washed out but otherwise in good shape.  There's no extras on the disk, but it's so inexpensive extras might have made me feel guilty.  Highly recommended, especially for war movie fans.",1120348800,14,2134,4.952247191011236
744010,5,6303935214,"Being a third generation Japanese-American (Sansei), and having my parents interned in the camps, this movie has a special place in my heart. Robert Pirosh did an incredible job in getting so much information about the Japanese- American situation: the camps, the differences between the Hawaiian and State- side Japanese (Kotonks and Kanakas), the different views of the war and even using a Japanese curse word as a password! I was so impressed and pleased with the results.
The movie follows the exploits of the 442, the first all-Nisei (Japanese- American) Regimental combat team in WWII. In early 1942, all the Japanese- Americans in California, Seattle, Oregon and Hawaii were uprooted from their homes and put into camps. All the volunteers were from the 10 internment camps throughout the western states. They felt that this was the only way to prove to the U. S. that they were as patriotic as anybody else, in fact most of them were American Citizens! Since they had nothing to lose, but their lives, their motto was ""GO FOR BROKE!"" and that's what they did. They are today the most decorated battalion in the history of the U.S. military and proved something that they shouldn't have to be proved, that they were Americans!
Van Johnson is used as the ""white man"" foil, to show how the rest of the country looked at the Japanese-American, and he does a great job. He starts off as a bigot, but as he begins to understand and respect his troops, he becomes one of them. There's a funny scene where one of his men call him ""BAKATARE"", which is a curse word close to ""Damn, stupid...."" and tells him that the soldier is being very polite, he's bowing as he says this. This film has everything: humor, action, great characters and... truth!",1050192000,87,1746,4.746710526315789

744527,5,6303935214,"This is an excellent film to recognize the bravery of a very special army unit in combat. Perhaps Hollywood will produce a more technically-detailed version some day, but the added value of this production is that it was made not long after WWII and was able to use some actual veterans from the 442nd RCT and the 100th Battalion which at that point was attached to the 442nd.

My father was an American Infantry officer during WWII and served from the WWII U.S. Army formation at the ""Great Louisiana Maneuvers"" in the summer of 1941 through all of the North African campaign, then Sicily, and all the way up Italy to the German surrender in May 1945. I was raised on stories of the war, and the 442nd's achievements were one of those stories. Dad never understood prejudice in any form but especially prejudice against men who were part of the same fighting force and most especially against men who showed themselves so bravely. As he told me early on and in a very respectful voice, ""The Nisei had the highest level of purple hearts and awards for bravery of any unit in the army."" Before the 442nd left Italy enroute to France [and saving the ""Lost Battalion""], there was an awards ceremony for them in northern Italy. I have a couple photos of that ceremony as my father proudly represented U.S. Fifth Army there. But I'm attaching another photo of the 442nd/100th Btn.in Italy--a photo of the unit being reviewed by then Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal with Gen. Mark Clark on the left and another officer--in helmet and probably the 442nd commander. I add the photo here because I believe the people who see the film and read the review comments would enjoy it.  Sincerely, Heydon Buchanan",1456531200,6,1703,4.673333333333333

At the camp was a large display of names of the real men who served in the 442nd battalion.  The 442nd battalion was made up of Japanese Americans from these camps who were asked to serve the country that had placed their families behind barbed wire.  The movie is based on the real battles fought by the 442nd during WWII in Europe.  The move shows some of the prejudice these men faced, from their own white officers and other white soldiers they fought with.  The movie is well done and tells a nice story.  Van Johnson is the White Officer who does not want to lead a group of ""Japs"".  He is told by another white officer, that they are not ""japs"" but Japanese Americans, or Nisei. Johnson slowly begins to respect his men and eventually defends them.  Historically the film is not bad.  All the honors and medals for the group and the individual soldiers were really earned.

tell the story of the most decorated outfit in our military, one made up of Japanese-
Americans fighting in Europe at a time when all Orientals were viewed with hate, or
at least suspicion. A reasonably good job is done by Van Johnson as the prejudiced
officer put in charge of a company of these soldiers, and by the writer and director at
showing how his attitude toward them gradually changes. But the story itself is thin,
and only a token (pun not intended) effort is made to flesh out the characters of the
soldiers themselves, and what they fought for.

745037,5,6303935214,"Academy Award nominated for Best Screenplay in 1952, this crisply restored classic WWII picture (which proved WAY ahead of its time) stars Van Johnson (THE CAINE MUTINY; BRIGADOON) as Lt. Michael Grayson.  He's the commanding officer of the real-life,all-Nisei (Japanese-American) 442nd Regimental Combat Team that fought in seven major European campaigns, received an equal number of Presidential  citations, and was gallantly awarded a total of 18,143 individual decorations; *Hot damn!*  Released in 1951, this film was the quintessential vanguard of anti-bigotry in America, where anti-Asian sentiment was growing once again due to the escalating conflict in North Korea. Reflective, poignant, and at times just plain harsh to certain realities, this film is in many ways a ""spiritual predecessor"" to 1989's GLORY.  The cast of GO FOR BROKE! were actual members of the 442nd.  The key to this film's singularity is its message for the particular time in which it is set. Initially bigoted himself at the start, a hesitant-to-accept Lt. Grayson, en route to Italy, reads a pamphlet from the war department that states, ""Racial prejudice is abhorrent to our American concept of Democracy."" Certainly, a most important message in any period of cinema.",1429488000,,1252,5.43298969072165

We are as proud of them as Americans and heroes as we are ashamed of America for the way we treated them and their families.  In Los Angeles, Santa Anita Thoroughbred Racetrack in Arcadia was a major transshipment point for Japanese Americans.  It was open only as long as it took to ""resettle""  all of the Japanese-Americans.  I was born in Arcadia in 1948 and grew up there.  Never did I hear about the camps and Arcadia's role there.  My mom even worked there.  Once I read about the camps and Mom's involvement in it I asked her. She said she did work in Arcadia during the war but that was a long time ago. Years later she admitted to anger and shame about the resettlement.  At the time she needed a job and they offered her a secretarial position.  Her position only lasted a matter of months and she was laid off.  Yes, she did know what was going on but folks along the West Coast expected an invasion any day.  I understand the fear and I carry some shame that Mom participated it.  These members of the 442nd Combat Regiment are some of my heroes from that time.",1425859200,2,1290,4.369747899159663

745338,5,6303935214,"GO FOR BROKE is a 90-minute black and white movie about WWII, initially taking place in a boot camp in Mississippi, with most of the movie taking place in Italy and France.  The subject of this movie is the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of 100th Infantry Battalion.  The movie includes a couple of battle scenes with German soldiers.  The general thrust of GO FOR BROKE is racism, and the transition of one of the officers in the U.S. military (hailing from Texas) from a racist to a vigorous anti-racist officer.  THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN, starring Lawrence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding, has the same type of theme, except that it involved aviators (U.S. Army Air force), not infantrymen the U.S. army.  Another parallel, is that both movies have a thread of comedy, though GO FOR BROKE is somewhat more comedic.  If you like to watch military hardware, then The Tuskeegee Airmen is a much better movie.

OPENING MINUTES.  Lieutenant Grayson arrives in a jeep at the boot camp, Camp Shelby in Mississippi.  The jeep passes some soldiers playing Hawaiian music.  The driver explains that the men are from Hawaii, and that they are to be contrasted with Japanese-Americans living on mainland in the US.  He explains that the mainland Japanese-Americans are called, ""Katonks,"" and that they got their name from the fact that when you strike their head, it makes the sound, ""Katonk, katonk, katonk,"" just like a coconut.  (Please see description of  the term ""Katonk"" and of the differences between Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii, and those living on mainland U.S.  This description can be found on, Go For Broke National Education Center.)  Grayson ignores this light banter from the driver.  The jeep parks, and Grayson almost knocks over a short Japanese-American soldier.  ""Look where you're going, will yuh,"" barks Grayson.  The driver exclaims to the soldier, with humor, ""90 day wonder, still got the shine on his bars!""

GRAYSON THE GREENHORN; GRAYSON THE RACIST.  At 3 minutes, Grayson shows himself to be a greenhorn, as he is about to open the door to the ENLISTED MEN'S ENTRANCE, but he catches himself on time, and does not open the door.  Grayson momentary primps, and tries to look dignified, then he ambles to the adjacent door, labeled, OFFICER'S ENTRANCE.  Once inside, Lieutenant Grayson asks a commanding officer for a transfer to another battalion which is made of his old friends from Texas.  (It is obvious that he does not like the Japanese.)  ""They are not Japs,"" exclaims the officer, ""they are ""Japanese-Americans, Neisei . . . they're all American citizens.""  At six minutes, still in the officer's quarters, we hear the Japanese playing Hawaiian music outside.  Grayson slams the window shut.

The officer tells him that he will be working with ""Ohara.""  Grayson gets giddy for a moment, apparently thinking that it is a hot babe like, ""Scarlett O'Hara,"" and he exclaims, ""O'Hara!!!""  ""That's right, Takashi Ohara,"" replies the commanding officer.  Grayson is downcast, because he does not like the Japanese.
At 14 minutes, Grayson is again shown to be awkward, when he takes a drink from a water fountain but accidently douses himself.  Comedy enters the story, when two Japanese-American soldiers in boot camp huddle behind a wooden barrier wall, in order to serve as steps.  One by one, a few other Japanese-American soldiers easily leap over the wall, using the huddling soldiers as a step.  Grayson becomes suspicious, and at the last moment, the huddling soldiers dash away.

LIVELY BANTER.  GO FOR BROKE dwells on the lively and convivial banter of the Japanese-American soldiers:  ""I was on the outside - Iowa - a free man knocking off $500 bucks a month.  I can look at a day old chicken and tell if it is a he or a she."" ""Now who'd want to know that except another chick,"" replies another soldier.  ""You pay for the poultry feed and you'd want to know.""  ""How come chicken farmers no can find out themselves?  Too bashful?""  ""Chick sexing is a science,"" responds the solder from Iowa.

ITALY. At 20 minutes, Grayson and his Japanese-American soldiers are on a ship, headed for Italy.  The voice-over reads from an army brochure that describes the layout and things to see in Italy.  The voice-over describes beautiful historic buildings, elegant hotels, and things of cultural importance.  But what we see on the movie screen is footage of bombed out buildings, and a scene where the Japanese-American soldiers are all huddled together for the night, sleeping in close quarters in a barn.  (This type of humor is an absolute classic, equaling anything found in Mad Magazine from the late 1950s, and early 1960s, when Mad Magazine was at its prime.)

ARRIVAL OF A PIG.  At 34 minutes, the Japanese-American receive their first taste of combat, and they sneak up a hill attempting to take over a German pillbox.  They succeed.  After killing the Germans, they knock open a door in the German's hideout.  A baby pig trots out.  One of the soldiers exclaims, ""The Jerry (German) intelligence officer, they're great at disguises!""  (I was not expecting to find such excellent humor in this film.)  The pig plays a continuing role in this movie, for the next 30 minutes or so, until it is donated to a hungry Italian family.

MORE BATTLE SCENES.  At 55 minutes, there is a battle scene, where the Japanese-Americans capture several Germans.  By the 70-minute mark in this movie, Grayson has become a solid defender of the Japanese-American soldiers, and he defends his men from the racist remarks from a soldier who was his colleague back in Texas.  A fist fight ensures, and Grayson beats the man up.  AT 73 minutes, there is another battle scene, this time in a forest. Then, we see a map in a house that was commandeered by the American troops, and they plan an evening attack against the Germans, where the goal is to rescue a battalion from Texas, commanded by a racist officer.  Back in the house, a soldier states, ""The Piper Cub pilot says that there's at least 100 up on this ridge, they'll be shooting right down our throats if we come up from either side . . . its slow going, minefields all over the place.""  At 80 minutes, another forest battle starts, but this involves friendly fire, and it is between the Japanese-Americans and the lost American battalion.  At 85-minutes, there is another encounter with Germans, and the Japanese-Americans win and take German prisoners.

SUMMARY.  The film ends somewhat abruptly, and it concludes with footage of a ship returning to the harbor at New York City.  Basically, the film  is a slice-of-life movie.  In contrast, THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMAN includes plenty of information of what occurs behind the scenes, that is, events taking place away from the actual airmen.  For example, The Tuskeegee Airmen shows footage from meetings of U.S. Congressmen.  But GO FOR BROKE is told entirely from the perspective of the Japanese-American grunt soldiers.  GO FOR BROKE does not have any violence.  Fortunately, GO FOR BROKE does not have any computer generated graphics.  All of the explosions are bone fide explosions!",1385078400,,7093,4.910774410774411

You have an obligatory conversion of a racist, you have the minority group exceeding all expectations and standards, and you have the politically correct CO in the background of it all.

Some of the banter is extremely memorable (""You know, if I was a Gerry on that ridge and a tank got close enough to shoot at me point-blank, I would take off like a ruptured duck... right over the side of the cliff""), and some less so (""You know, there's only one thing I don't like about these Buddha-heads... they don't dig em (foxholes) long enough!"").

I thought that most of them sentimentalized war too much, though I think ""The Longest Day"" was a pretty good effort. This movie was surprisingly good. Some of the scenes were very cheesy, but I liked the little touches of humor - for example, the soldier who wanted to be an architect always commented upon the local architecture even while bullets were whizzing around him. I also am impressed that the producers got real-life veterans of the 442nd to play roles in this movie, and most of them did a tolerably good acting job. What really made this movie for me, however, was the fact that it recognized the rescue of the Lost Battalion , and the tremendous sacrifice made by the 442nd in liberating those men. It was one of the most important battles of the European war, and yet not much mention has been made of it. Even to this day, I do not think that most people recognize the courage and sacrifice of the Nisei during that time, or can even fathom the need for so many of them to sacrifice themselves or their sons to prove their loyalty to a country that imprisoned them, took away their property and rights, and viewed them as second class citizens.

745595,4,6303935214,"Lt. Grayson (Van Johnson) is assigned to a new platoon, away from his friends from Texas. His new outfit is much different from the old; it consists of Japanese-Americans from all over the country. This throws a wrench into the situation because Grayson has a racist streak and he holds no bars on disciplining his men. Trial after trial they improve their standing until they have formed a combat-ready troupe. Off they go to travel the world, complete with travel brochures about the eating delicacies they will encounter. The story unfolds in a typical way with a good balance of humor and action. It is an admirable follow-up on the success of another Johnson film Battleground.

The Japanese characters are rather interesting to watch. It was rare for them to receive starring roles in mainstream American films, so this is a nice treat. As one might expect of such a film, each plays a type. There is the tough guy (George Miki), the underappreciated runt (Henry Nakamura), and the leader (Henry Oyasato). Each of them becomes lovable in his own way, and it is sort of sad knowing that none of them got a chance to star again. Unlike the contract players of MGM of the day, they faded from the spotlight into relative obscurity.

I saw at least one Japanese-American in the movie from Texas, speaking with a Texas accent.  These soldiers didn't know each other before the war any more than any other soldier.
