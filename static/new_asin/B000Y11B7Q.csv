3010489,5,B000Y11B7Q,This is a great two pack to have in anyones collection.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the 80's movies.,1253836800,,116,4.2727272727272725
3010490,4,B000Y11B7Q,"I love these movies - I remember watching them as a little kid.  Even though the jokes went flying over my head when I was younger, there was still quite a bit for me to enjoy and laugh at.  Now that I'm older, I catch a LOT more of the jokes, and the movies are still hilarious!

I'm so glad that the movies are packaged together, but I have two (fairly small) qualms: first of all, both movies are in fullscreen.  Not a big deal to some people, but the pan-and-scan is noticeable in some of the more fast-moving scenes.  Second, neither DVD has special features of any kind.  I would love to hear the star's reactions to the movies, or see a deleted scene, but these are nowhere to be found.  All in all, though - DVDs worth having.",1242432000,19,734,4.2
3010491,5,B000Y11B7Q,"If you haven't seen these movies then you really should, they are so cute, great for guys and girls...good, clean humor!",1238544000,,120,4.761904761904762

3010493,4,B000Y11B7Q,"Ted Danson, Tom Selleck, and Steve Guttenberg star in this light- hearted comedy about how 3 New York bachelors receive a big change in their lives after finding a baby on their doorstep. With humor that primarily surround the ordeal the 3 men have to contend with, 3 MEN AND A BABY relies on the chemistry the 3 main stars generate with  each other. At first they experience dismay with the infant; I mean, how can three unmarried men take care of a baby?! But soon enough the 3 guys fall in love with her. But with good measure, a drug- smuggling subplot is thrown in (probably to make it not look like your a typical family-oriented comedy). Nevertheless, Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg shine. The same goes for the cute little baby Mary, and a  good direction from an unlikely director, Leonard ""Mr. Spock"" Nimoy himself!",1222128000,,826,4.6506849315068495
3010494,5,B000Y11B7Q,"The DVD is exceptional and I have enjpyed it many times since I have received it. The service and product are quality and I would highly recommend it.

3010497,5,B000Y11B7Q,"This is such a cute family movie, both parts 1 & 2.  Three men who care for a baby, and only one is the father, but they all care and love her.  Part 2 is when she's alittle older and her mother wants to get married to someone who's not fond of children, and as you can almost guess, the 3 fathers who raised her come to the rescue and show the mother that her fiance isn't the man she thinks he is.  Cute, I could watch it over and over.",1214784000,,438,3.791208791208791

3010572,4,B000Y11B7Q,"1987 saw the release of Three Men and a Baby, directed by Leonard Nimoy (no one seems to remember that factor), starring Tom Sellack, Steve Guttenburg, and Ted Danson, an adaptation of a French film ""Three Men and a Cradle"".  Selleck, as Peter the architect, Guttenburg as cartoonist Michael, and Danson as Jack the actor, are happily living in their New York City apartment as bachelors when one day, when he comes home from a jog, Peter finds a baby sleeping at their door.  He and Michael find a note with the baby, Mary, addressed from a woman named Sylvia to Jack, who is away shooting a movie.  She says she can't handle this anymore and is now leaving Mary with him.  Distressed to say the least, Peter and Michael have to cope with suddenly having a baby in their household and not having the slightest idea how to care for it.  Before he left, Jack had made an arrangement with a director friend to have a package delivered to their home, and Peter and Michael think that the baby is the package in question.  After many bumbling attempts to properly care for the baby and adapting their lives to hers, one day some men come to the door wanting to collect their package.  They had an additional package delivered that day by their landlady and had tossed it aside thinking the actual package in question was the baby.  Attempting to regain Mary, Peter trips and falls and lets the package fly open, revealing that it's actually heroin that they are after.  In a rather hilarious scene that ensues of proving their innocence to the police, plus taking out their revenge on Jack when he returns by sticking him with caregiving to Mary, the three embrace their roles as guardians for the baby.  Then, one day, Sylvia reappears on their doorstep.  She and Jack had had a tryst about a year and a half ago and Mary was the result, and now she intends to take Mary back to London, her hometown.  When they let her go, Sylvia then returns in tears and says she doesn't want to take Mary away from them but also wants to stay in New York working.  They then agree to have Sylvia and Mary move in with them, and they will raise her in a rather odd but loving family.

1990 saw the release of its sequel, Three Men and A Little Lady.  The four have been living together for a few years, Mary is now five.  Sylvia announces that she is going to marry an Englishman and move back to England with Mary.  Michael and Peter travel to England and find out that Sylvia's fiance, Edward, actually intends to pack Mary off to a boarding school and attempt to interfere.  It is then revealed that Peter has always had a thing for Sylvia, and she for him, and it ends rather happily with the two of them marrying instead of to Edward (as the minister was actually Jack in prosthetic make up).

The first movie was a good time, as it shows a lot of bumbling comedy antics of the three men trying to care for an infant without a female presence and trying to make it all work somehow.  There are a lot of holes in the plot, to be sure (just like that they can care for a baby without legal troubles, etc.), but the sequel had more holes and more problems.  Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenburg and Ted Danson give nice performances as three average guys trying to make it work, their physical and verbal comedy is spot on and they have a good chemistry together.  However, the sequel seemed to be rather rushed and a bit choppy with even more holes in it.  It's lite comedy and two feel good movies.  Enjoy them.",1460246400,,3491,4.3934681181959565

3010694,5,B000Y11B7Q,"I love Three Men and a Baby. Tom Selleck's big screen career really took off with this movie. His comments and expressions as he and his batchelor buddies try to figure out how to change baby's diaper after being abandoned at their door step. What starts out to be a downright funny movie turns into a cute little tale as our three batchelor's master baby sitting and become so attached they don't want to give her back when mommy shows up to reclaim her bundle.
I also liked Three Men and a Little Lady which was the sequel with baby molly gowing up and mommy getting married to some English chap when in reality she has fallen in love with Selleck's character and the antics his batchelor buddies put him through to get the two together including going over to England for the wedding. As sequels go the latter wasn't quite as good as the original but both are a joy to watch and anything with Tom Selleck was pretty well worth watching.",1369958400,,939,4.433526011560693

The movies were as enjoyable as I remembered them.  I used to enjoy the second movie more than the first movie - now I enjoy the first movie a little more than the second.

3010724,4,B000Y11B7Q,"My review is limited to THREE MEN AND A BABY. Three swinging men share an apartment in New York City. The girlfriend of one of them gives birth, and suddenly abandons the baby with the father. He soon takes off, leaving the two remaining men to take care of the baby.

What a disaster! The men have a strong case of learned helplessness. They have no clue as to what to do. They cannot fasten a diaper properly. They have no idea how to use baby oil and baby powder. At one point, they use a turkey baster to rinse the skin of the soiled baby girl. When they finally attach the diaper, it turns out to be too big, and it slides right off. The feeding schedules and the infant cries completely mess up the schedules and sleeping times of the men. They soon are so exhausted that they cannot function properly at work.

One woman acquaintance who is asked to help tells the men that she has no innate skills in dealing with an infant just because she is a woman. The mother of the father of the baby girl also refuses to help, pointing out that her adult son must finally learn some responsibility for his actions. Other complications develop. Someone mistakenly ships a package of heroin to the apartment, and a narcotics cop comes and performs a search.

In time, the father of the infant returns, and, after getting a lot of flak for taking off, he joins the other two men in become strongly attached to the baby girl. Then there are fireworks: A drug-dealing action overtakes the three hapless, innocent men, and the mother shows up to claim her baby...The ending is anticlimactic.

The acting is good. The frequent use of foul language detracts from the film.",1299456000,2,1662,4.475247524752476

3010730,5,B000Y11B7Q,"Here are another good couple of movies from my childhood. I hadn't even thought about them for a while, until I saw news article online that a third one is in the works ""Three Men and a Bride"". When I read that article, it brought back all the fun memories of these movies, and how much I liked them. I haven't seen them probably in over 10 years. I will be happy to watch them again with my family now, and relive a piece of my younger days. I am a child of the 80's, and its alway fun for me to see some those good movies that came out of that decade, especially the funny ones. For wife who is a child of the 90's, this will be her first time ever seeing them. Most of my favorite movies, she has never seen or even heard of, so they are fun to share with her. My sons will not have a clue, but maybe someday when they are old enough, they will watch some of their dad's old movies with me. My oldest (2), already likes the cartoons from those days, so maybe when he is a little older, he might like the movies too.",1273622400,,1018,3.9466019417475726

3244987,4,B000Y11B7Q,"I love these movies - I remember watching them as a little kid.  Even though the jokes went flying over my head when I was younger, there was still quite a bit for me to enjoy and laugh at.  Now that I'm older, I catch a LOT more of the jokes, and the movies are still hilarious!

I'm so glad that the movies are packaged together, but I have two (fairly small) qualms: first of all, both movies are in fullscreen.  Not a big deal to some people, but the pan-and-scan is noticeable in some of the more fast-moving scenes.  Second, neither DVD has special features of any kind.  I would love to hear the star's reactions to the movies, or see a deleted scene, but these are nowhere to be found.  All in all, though - DVDs worth having.",1242432000,19,734,4.2

3244990,4,B000Y11B7Q,"Ted Danson, Tom Selleck, and Steve Guttenberg star in this light- hearted comedy about how 3 New York bachelors receive a big change in their lives after finding a baby on their doorstep. With humor that primarily surround the ordeal the 3 men have to contend with, 3 MEN AND A BABY relies on the chemistry the 3 main stars generate with  each other. At first they experience dismay with the infant; I mean, how can three unmarried men take care of a baby?! But soon enough the 3 guys fall in love with her. But with good measure, a drug- smuggling subplot is thrown in (probably to make it not look like your a typical family-oriented comedy). Nevertheless, Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg shine. The same goes for the cute little baby Mary, and a  good direction from an unlikely director, Leonard ""Mr. Spock"" Nimoy himself!",1222128000,,826,4.6506849315068495

3245069,4,B000Y11B7Q,"1987 saw the release of Three Men and a Baby, directed by Leonard Nimoy (no one seems to remember that factor), starring Tom Sellack, Steve Guttenburg, and Ted Danson, an adaptation of a French film ""Three Men and a Cradle"".  Selleck, as Peter the architect, Guttenburg as cartoonist Michael, and Danson as Jack the actor, are happily living in their New York City apartment as bachelors when one day, when he comes home from a jog, Peter finds a baby sleeping at their door.  He and Michael find a note with the baby, Mary, addressed from a woman named Sylvia to Jack, who is away shooting a movie.  She says she can't handle this anymore and is now leaving Mary with him.  Distressed to say the least, Peter and Michael have to cope with suddenly having a baby in their household and not having the slightest idea how to care for it.  Before he left, Jack had made an arrangement with a director friend to have a package delivered to their home, and Peter and Michael think that the baby is the package in question.  After many bumbling attempts to properly care for the baby and adapting their lives to hers, one day some men come to the door wanting to collect their package.  They had an additional package delivered that day by their landlady and had tossed it aside thinking the actual package in question was the baby.  Attempting to regain Mary, Peter trips and falls and lets the package fly open, revealing that it's actually heroin that they are after.  In a rather hilarious scene that ensues of proving their innocence to the police, plus taking out their revenge on Jack when he returns by sticking him with caregiving to Mary, the three embrace their roles as guardians for the baby.  Then, one day, Sylvia reappears on their doorstep.  She and Jack had had a tryst about a year and a half ago and Mary was the result, and now she intends to take Mary back to London, her hometown.  When they let her go, Sylvia then returns in tears and says she doesn't want to take Mary away from them but also wants to stay in New York working.  They then agree to have Sylvia and Mary move in with them, and they will raise her in a rather odd but loving family.

1990 saw the release of its sequel, Three Men and A Little Lady.  The four have been living together for a few years, Mary is now five.  Sylvia announces that she is going to marry an Englishman and move back to England with Mary.  Michael and Peter travel to England and find out that Sylvia's fiance, Edward, actually intends to pack Mary off to a boarding school and attempt to interfere.  It is then revealed that Peter has always had a thing for Sylvia, and she for him, and it ends rather happily with the two of them marrying instead of to Edward (as the minister was actually Jack in prosthetic make up).

The first movie was a good time, as it shows a lot of bumbling comedy antics of the three men trying to care for an infant without a female presence and trying to make it all work somehow.  There are a lot of holes in the plot, to be sure (just like that they can care for a baby without legal troubles, etc.), but the sequel had more holes and more problems.  Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenburg and Ted Danson give nice performances as three average guys trying to make it work, their physical and verbal comedy is spot on and they have a good chemistry together.  However, the sequel seemed to be rather rushed and a bit choppy with even more holes in it.  It's lite comedy and two feel good movies.  Enjoy them.",1460246400,,3491,4.3934681181959565

3245191,5,B000Y11B7Q,"I love Three Men and a Baby. Tom Selleck's big screen career really took off with this movie. His comments and expressions as he and his batchelor buddies try to figure out how to change baby's diaper after being abandoned at their door step. What starts out to be a downright funny movie turns into a cute little tale as our three batchelor's master baby sitting and become so attached they don't want to give her back when mommy shows up to reclaim her bundle.
I also liked Three Men and a Little Lady which was the sequel with baby molly gowing up and mommy getting married to some English chap when in reality she has fallen in love with Selleck's character and the antics his batchelor buddies put him through to get the two together including going over to England for the wedding. As sequels go the latter wasn't quite as good as the original but both are a joy to watch and anything with Tom Selleck was pretty well worth watching.",1369958400,,939,4.433526011560693

The movies were as enjoyable as I remembered them.  I used to enjoy the second movie more than the first movie - now I enjoy the first movie a little more than the second.  But they were both great fun and I'm sure I will watch them many more times to come over the years.  A good purchase!  Recommended.  Excellent value for money.",1368230400,,503,4.166666666666667

3245221,4,B000Y11B7Q,"My review is limited to THREE MEN AND A BABY. Three swinging men share an apartment in New York City. The girlfriend of one of them gives birth, and suddenly abandons the baby with the father. He soon takes off, leaving the two remaining men to take care of the baby.

What a disaster! The men have a strong case of learned helplessness. They have no clue as to what to do. They cannot fasten a diaper properly. They have no idea how to use baby oil and baby powder. At one point, they use a turkey baster to rinse the skin of the soiled baby girl. When they finally attach the diaper, it turns out to be too big, and it slides right off. The feeding schedules and the infant cries completely mess up the schedules and sleeping times of the men. They soon are so exhausted that they cannot function properly at work.

One woman acquaintance who is asked to help tells the men that she has no innate skills in dealing with an infant just because she is a woman. The mother of the father of the baby girl also refuses to help, pointing out that her adult son must finally learn some responsibility for his actions. Other complications develop. Someone mistakenly ships a package of heroin to the apartment, and a narcotics cop comes and performs a search.

In time, the father of the infant returns, and, after getting a lot of flak for taking off, he joins the other two men in become strongly attached to the baby girl. Then there are fireworks: A drug-dealing action overtakes the three hapless, innocent men, and the mother shows up to claim her baby...The ending is anticlimactic.

The acting is good. The frequent use of foul language detracts from the film.",1299456000,2,1662,4.475247524752476

3245227,5,B000Y11B7Q,"Here are another good couple of movies from my childhood. I hadn't even thought about them for a while, until I saw news article online that a third one is in the works ""Three Men and a Bride"". When I read that article, it brought back all the fun memories of these movies, and how much I liked them. I haven't seen them probably in over 10 years. I will be happy to watch them again with my family now, and relive a piece of my younger days. I am a child of the 80's, and its alway fun for me to see some those good movies that came out of that decade, especially the funny ones. For wife who is a child of the 90's, this will be her first time ever seeing them. Most of my favorite movies, she has never seen or even heard of, so they are fun to share with her. My sons will not have a clue, but maybe someday when they are old enough, they will watch some of their dad's old movies with me. My oldest (2), already likes the cartoons from those days, so maybe when he is a little older, he might like the movies too.",1273622400,,1018,3.9466019417475726
