I don't want to foil the plot, but its really good with an unexpected ending. Its in subtitles, but its so dramatic the subtitles are easy to follow.",1345939200,,316,4.56140350877193
8362508,5,B002BYYAG8,"I'm so surprised that I did not hear about his movie before, I saw the movie at blockbuster and decided to bring it home. Also as the last reviewer, I can not understand why was not nominated for the oscar for best foreign movie. Talking about the last review the only thing that the lady did not get right is that the movie plot was in Mexico city, not Barcelona as she stated. Anyway, you will really enjoy this movie and cinematography is also great. I liked this movie so much that I decided to buy it for my personal collection.",1272585600,2,533,4.287128712871287
8362509,5,B002BYYAG8,"One of my best movie experiences in 2009/2010.  Why it was never nominated for an Oscar I do not know?

An absolute must see.  Up there, and equal to other spanish-language greats ""Habla con Ella"", ""Pans Labyrinthe"" and ""Amores Perros"".

Writer and director Simon Bross has created a magical script telling the 2 convincing stories of an aspiring nun, and a young girl growing up with a mother obsessed by body image.

Both stories are set in the backdrop of a moody, modern and surreal Barcelona, where it rains every day (leading to the Nun's belief that this is the coming of the great flood).  The cinematography is sublime, and with beautiful (and subtle) references to Salvador Dali.

Not wanting to spoil the endings (which are great), through the 2 story-lines the main themes of the movie: love, religion and body image are beautifully explored and presented through great story-telling.  Topics rarely explored in todays cinema.  Not difficult to understand or too abstract.  A DVD worth purchasing for your gold collection.",1267142400,3,1034,4.994152046783626
