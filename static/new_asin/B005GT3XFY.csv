4693698,3,B005GT3XFY,"Grace (Selena Gomez), a small town Texas girl has been saving up for 4 years through High School to go to Paris. She is excited about going with her friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) who seems to be a bit of a floozy- shoes she says, ""If they ain't hurtin' they ain't helpin'. However Dad wants her to take along her step sister Meg (Leighton Meester)who is not exactly welcomed as she looks too much like Kristen Stewart with the blood drained out of her and acts about the same.

The three are in Paris having a miserable time because their tour is inanely rushing them. It isn't long before they become separated.

Grace is mistaken for Cordelia Winthrop Scott, British heiress and the 3 Cinderellas end up in Monte Carlo, dressed up and going to a ball. At this point the plot is pretty well established. The acting was less than expected, as was the script. Comedy is very light. This is perhaps a young teen female movie. Originally Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts were supposed to star in this film, but the producers wanted a younger cast...guess how that worked out?

No bad language, so sex, no nudity. Drop the girls off and go.",1311638400,14,1133,4.517073170731707
4693699,4,B005GT3XFY,"This was a pretty good movie besides kissing and REALLY immodest oufits. It was also princess diaries again: in a way, that it. You see it's about Grace (selena gomez) and her step-sister I think and best friend who go to Paris because they want to take a ""break"" sort of, but they end up in Monte Carlo because she's mistaken for the princess person of Monte Carlo. It's pretty interesting, but it's a little like princess diaries. and there's lots of ""un-reasonableness"" in it, but it's a pretty good movie.",1310774400,,509,4.604395604395604
4693700,4,B005GT3XFY,"This was a really cute movie probably aimed at teens.  It was not meant to be high art, so I'm rating it for delivering a good job for what it was intended to be:  a cute and well written story about 3 nice and likeable Texas girls, mostly set in wonderful, romantic European settings, and just a lot of fun overall.  All three actresses were quite good and this was a nice afternoon escape film. It was nice to see a teen film that was pretty positive and wholesome for a change, not too old for its intended audience. I saw this in a theater mostly full of mid to late teen girls, and they all seemed to be enjoying it a lot.",1309651200,56,627,4.08130081300813
4693701,3,B005GT3XFY,"A young woman takes her dream vacation to Paris with her best friend and her step-sister. The trip doesn't go as planned, and then she is mistaken for a wealthy heiress. The three go on to connect with hunky guys and vacation in luxury. In the end, they may learn something about themselves. This is a harmless film that just about anyone can enjoy. It is predictable, and does not contain any great dramatic moments, but it has an attractive young cast and the movie's target audience of teenage girls will find it entertaining. I would recommend this one if you are in the mood for some lighthearted entertainment.",1309651200,37,616,4.660550458715596

4693713,2,B005GT3XFY,"I think the goal of this movie was to show that Selena Gomez can do an accent.  Other than that, it's not really worth watching.  The premise is not very believable, and it really seems to be geared exclusively towards teenagers.  The plot does some things to salvage itself, but it comes up short.",1491696000,,298,4.481481481481482

4693763,3,B005GT3XFY,"This was a cute movie, don't get me wrong, I just think my daughter enjoyed this movie more than I did. I get the plot of the movie is to leave the country and explore all that there is to offer, when they arrive. To me the movie tends to ""Jump"" around a lot, and it's not exactly the easiest thing to following along with. She is mistaken for someone else, so much so that even her ""Staff"" doesn't realize that she isn't who they think she is. However when they discover that they've made a mistake, the New Princess is the one they want to keep, while the other is still the major pain in the butt. The cast for this movie was great, they seems to work well with each other. Like I said this was a cute movie, but it just wasn't for me. I would recommend this for any teenager girl who enjoys a good fantasy or make believe. Everyone has a doppelganger out there some where, I do believe this. And sometimes wishes do come true!",1460246400,,930,4.143646408839779

Even though the little French boy love interest of Selena's is prettier than all the girls combined, and that is saying something indeed, people. I also really liked the side story about Leighton Meester's character, which seemed completely plausible. This is the kind of movie you watch when your husband is out of town for the week...Monte Carlo, Princess Diaries, and maybe Enchanted, a big bowl of popcorn, a soda, and some chocolate covered raisins.

4693865,5,B005GT3XFY,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old niece who LOVES this movie (she's also obsessed with Selena Gomez at the moment as well). So it was playing on Disney of ABC Family and I decided to watch it. It's definitely more teeny-bopper like. Despite being a thirty-something mother of 2, I do actually like Selena Gomez overall as an actress, but this was definitely more Disney-ish. Her accent was just awful. Yikes. But in tween mentality, I can see why my niece loves it so much. It was cute for the genre they were aiming towards.",1424476800,3,547,4.372549019607843

I was very surprised at what a good little actress Gomez is. She did a
bang-up job on the mean,pompous character she played (she played two young
women).  I hadn't liked the dark-haired actress (the one who plays her
step-sister) in other films, but I thought she was likeable in this one.",1417996800,,362,4.73015873015873

4694063,5,B005GT3XFY,"First I rented it then I bought it. This is a fun movie that will take repeated viewings and is suitable for the entire family. I had read nothing about the movie but a very brief synopsis so we watched it for the first time with an open mind.

As with all movies, it makes a set of assumptions which you either can, or cannot buy into. I've now read some of the reviews and have noted both kinds of responses, those from viewers who could and those who couldn't. The movie is light-hearted, fun, and fast-paced and both my wife and I were laughing out loud as we watched the story progress.

I haven't checked, but it certainly looks like the opening of the movie was set in Texas, it looks like the filming took place somewhere in the western part of Texas for sure. The majority of the movie is set in Paris and Monte Carlo and offers the beautiful scenery usually associated with those locations.

Although I rented the movie because it sounded like a chick flick my wife would enjoy, it turned out we both had fun with it and will enjoy watching it again sometime so now I've bought the movie. If you enjoyed the Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks sort of romantic comedy then I suspect you'll enjoy this one too.",1373673600,2,1203,4.314159292035399

Selena Gomez's English accent seemed to go in and out of character which sort of fit the scenes where she's pretending to be a princess.

I just found this a bit too saccharine even for teenage girls who are the main demographic for this sort of thing.

Kudos on the extras as they do a feature (for those same teenage girls) on the boys in the movie as well as this personality quiz to see which of the three sisters ""you"" are most like.",1348185600,,600,4.348214285714286

It was more about growing up and letting things go, finding yourself. And it have a good touch of comedy and fantasy.

I'm not a big Selena Gomez fan by any stretch of the imagination, but my 6-year-old daughter is. She convinced us to order this movie on-demand.  My wife and I really enjoyed watching the film with her, so much so that we ended up buying the DVD. Needless to say, that weekend we must have watched this movie like 5 or 6 times, but it never got old!  It is a light, fun, and funny movie for everyone.  There is romance, adventure, humor, good acting.  What's not to like?

I think those who gave this movie low marks were expecting something else.  An Oscar contender, it isn't.  It is what it is, and that ain't bad.",1340582400,2,743,4.257142857142857

But like I said Selena Gomez, is doing great is this movie, she really shows the world that she is so much more then just a Disney prinsess.
Cory is also good in this one, I've seen him in Glee and seeing him in something else is amazing. You get to she him as someone else for a change and he is doing is amazingly.
All in all everybody is doing a really good job.
I would tell you to see this movie, if you're a fan of Selena or some of the other stars in this, or if you like a good laugh, love, romance and sisterhood.",1338508800,,776,3.8867924528301887
4694154,5,B005GT3XFY,"First of all: I don't have a daughter, but 2 sons (4 and 10). While the younger one never saw this movie, our older one loves it. Secondly: I'm a hopeless romantic, loving to watch movies like this with my wife! If any of this disqualifies me in your opinion to write a review on this movie: Don't bother reading any further :)

For those of you who are still here: This is a GREAT movie for the whole family to enjoy. It's about facing challenges in a creative way, stepping over one's shadow, connecting with seemingly lost feelings and loosening up. All in all it is a very balanced movie with NO language or sensual scenes, both rare in teen movies nowadays. It reminded me of the ""good-old"" Audrey Hepburn movies from the 40's and 50's, where movies still had a (positive) message, and the characters didn't end up together after having a few drinks or just got bitten by a vampire!

What I liked the most was the way the movie shows the development of the 3 girls while stranded in Europe, and how each one of them had to face one of her inner giants.

Yes, the movie obviously borrows from other movies, incl. ""Princess Diaries"" and ""Ice Princess"". But it does it in a very witty way that makes it stick out from the copy-cat crowd. It's whole storyline actually makes sense, and one doesn't have to check his/her brain out at the counter. And did I mention that it has great happy-endings?

For all of you who were sitting on the fence: Do yourself and your boys/daughters a favor and get it! This movie can/will open room for conversations with your teens. Dads: This is NOT your typical Chick-Flick! It deals with real issues real people have, but keeps it on the lighter side.

Lastly: Get it on Blu-ray! The scenes in/around Paris and Monte Carlo and inside the expensive Hotels are worth it!",1336003200,15,1804,4.47112462006079
4694155,5,B005GT3XFY,Gave this as a gift which received rave reviews.  The DVD has repeatedly been viewed at the girls slumber parties and shared with family and friends.  A hit.,1335916800,,157,4.571428571428571
4694156,4,B005GT3XFY,"Monte Carlo is a teen version of the Prince and the Pauper with girl friends. Be forwarned--This is a Disney-like formula for the teen crowd. A few years ago, it would have Hillary Duff, Miley Cyrus or Lindsay Lohan playing the female lead instead of Disney star from Wizards of Waverly Place's Selina Gomez

This film had been done before in a wayt in the Disney Lizzie McGuire movie. Funny,  Who says? (the Lizzie McGuire movie theme song) is sung by  Gomez on the end credits.

Before you get to the end credits, you get a lovely  plot of sibbling rivally between two step sisters (Gomez and Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester) who don't respect each other and their parents send them to Paris together. Gomez's waitress friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) joins their trip. It seems almost like a modern day, Europian ""Where the Boys are""!

The threesome miss their tour bus in Paris. Gomez also plays a look-a-like monster socialite who is a brat. Gomez is mistaken for the heiress.  The threesome take her hotel since the socialite goes on a unplanned spree. The threesome then ventures to Monte Carlo in the socialite's place and plot gets predictable..but it is fun in a Disney-ish, Frank Capra like way

There are big names in small roles in this film. Glee's Cory Montieth is Emma's boyfriend who searches Paris for the trio. His four scences of the film  is short at best, but longer than a cameo. Dr Who's Catherine Tate steals the end of the film in her cameo. However Jane by Design's Andie MacDowell and Make It or Break it's Brett Cullen appearances are wasted as Gomez's and Meetser's parents in this movie.

The direction is similar to a modern day Disney Teen adventure...something you may get on ABC family channel.  It works and it succeeds on many levels. Its formula, but adults who want to watch something with their teens, other than Pretty Little Liars, will have a GREAT TIME watching this because the films does not talk down to the audience..i do mean it. It is formula that we have all seen before but it is intelligently presented.

Its fun in a four star way!

4694159,3,B005GT3XFY,"Remember when you were a kid (or for some of you as adults) when you'd watch the late show and see those movies about teens of college age kids heading somewhere for a fun vacation? It always seemed like Connie Francis, Jim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, Troy Donahue or Sandra Dee were heading to Florida or California to have fun in the sun. Inevitably someone fell in love, someone was hurt and life long romances followed. These were light and fluffy films that offered fun with a touch of drama and an occasional great theme song (""Where the Boys Are""?). MONTE CARLO is like one of those movies made for the current generation.

Selena Gomez stars as Grace, a waitress who can't wait to get out of her one note town and discover the world. Living with her mother and step father is fine but she can't seem to get along with her step sister Meg (Leighton Meester) at all. In an effort to iron things out, their parents allow Grace to go on a vacation to France is Meg goes along. Neither is happy with this but it happens. Along with them goes Grace's best friend Emma (Katie Cassidy), a rough and tumble fellow waitress with dreams of romance and a boyfriend who just doesn't seem to get her.

The three land in France only to discover that the brochure about their planned trip doesn't quite live up to it's promises. Cramped hotels and getting only seconds to look at the sights isn't what they expected at all. Accidentally separated from their group, they stop in a hotel where Grace is mistaken for Cordelia Winthrop Scott, a socialite snob of English nobility who treats people like dirt. Overhearing that she's sneaking off to meet someone and avoid the press, shrugging off the duties of her position, Emma convinces the girls to take her place with Grace impersonating her.

The usual follows with them enjoying the high life and never having to pay for it all. Financially that is. Emma is treated to the interest of a wealthy man and his ways. Grace meets a man in charge of the auction her ""character"" is supposed to be a part of and falls in love and Meg meets the man of her dreams who makes her open up a bit. As with the old movies, some are setting themselves up for a fall while others will find happiness. In the end it's all good and things work out for the best. Okay that's not a spoiler so no reason for a warning. These movies always end the same and that's just fine. It's not the end result that comes into play here but the journey it takes to get there that makes them fun.

All three actresses do a fine job here, making you believe that they are the naive girls who just want to sample the good life before heading home to their mundane lives. While the situations they find themselves in seem a bit over the top, it's all in good fun and that's what watching this is all about. Looking for something light, fluffy and fun?

4694163,3,B005GT3XFY,"My 7-year old daughter did enjoy this movie, but I felt it was just so-so for the genre. I would put it in the same category as the Princess Diaries movies, except instead of Anne Hathaway as Princess of a small European nation, this stars Selena Gomez as a recent high school graduate from a small town in Texas, who is visiting France with friends, and upon being mistaken for an English heiress, decides to go with that and impersonate her for awhile, in order to enjoy the lifestyle. The plot is beyond ridiculous, but of course so are the Princess Diaries plots, but somehow I was able to handle that. This one just seemed really hokey - more like a TV special. The performances are fine, and setting is lovely, and it's all very cute and (mostly) harmless, but it's not one of the better 'girl flicks' out. If you're having a sleepoever of girls 7-11 or so, this would probably be very popular, but otherwise, skip it.",1329091200,2,924,4.4733727810650885

I do not believe their was any in appropriate language.

Selena Gomez did some great acting and made me laugh throughout the movie.",1324684800,,399,4.28
4694211,1,B005GT3XFY,"Monte Carlo is very obviously targeted for a specific demographic. It's a travel movie about three young girls who plan a dream trip to Paris, only to be whisked away in glitz and glamour to Monte Carlo when one of them is mistaken for a wealthy heiress, and it stars Selena Gomez, Leighton Meester, and Katie Cassidy. It should, therefore, surprise no one that the film was predictably sweet and charming in parts, and completely riddled with formulaic clichs in most others. What we have here is a piece of fantasy fiction for young girls who dream of being princesses - or, at the very least, treated like princesses - so you can take that for what it's worth and decide if it's right for you. What I can tell you is that I wasn't so impressed by it, but let's be honest for a minute here: are the girls who will watch this really going to care what I have to say about it?",1323648000,4,876,4.315151515151515
4694212,4,B005GT3XFY,"Starring Selena Gomez, and definitely targeted to teens, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in spite of myself.  Three teenage girls become unlikely companions on a trip to France which leads them into some unexpected situations.  Predictable? Yes.  Boring? Never.  It is a brain vacation indeed, and ten years from now I will probably loathe this movie and loathe myself for having enjoyed it, but for me it was upbeat fun.  It at least has the depth of the classic ""Roman Holiday"" and, for the moment anyway, is at least just as much fun.",1323648000,2,537,4.731182795698925

4694244,4,B005GT3XFY,"This was a charming, light, chick flick. Selena Gomez is utterly charming as a warm-hearted, earnest Texas girl who is visiting France for the first time with her lively friend and stiff step-sister, when she is mistaken for a wealthy heiress. The roles are well played, and the love interests are well cast. It is a bit formulaic, but it is a romantic comedy. The scenery is beautiful, the boys' Australian and French accents are real, and I particularly enjoyed the three romances involved.",1320105600,2,492,4.869047619047619
4694245,1,B005GT3XFY,"Chick flick, and yes, guys have their guy flicks but I'm just showing how formula genres have a life of their own irrespective of how much value there is in them.
Proof:
(1.) Three young women leave their fantasy live in a small town to go to Paris.
(2.) Live a Cinderella vacation.
(3.) Lots of attention; money; hot spots.
(4.) Three guys (of course) representing the three archetypes - good ol' boy next door; adventuresome guy; charming wealthy prince type.
(5.) Lots of appropriate filler music to cover for the numerous dull, tedious, boring scenes.
(6.) Gotta have the emotional mood swings within and between our girls to provide emotional tension but was too contrived.
(7.) Goodness prevails. (Must be a movie.)

Conclusion:
Divorce rates; TV soaps; fantasy movies; shopping; food addictions; support groups/activities - is it really that bad?",1320019200,5,853,5.049645390070922

4694247,3,B005GT3XFY,this movie was okay. it had a great cast and everything. it just did not have that much comedy in it. i like romantic films but when it is a romantic comedy i want more comedy in it. but everythin else was okay i suposse you could say it was to much of a chick flick for me. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.,1319500800,,331,3.742857142857143

I saw this movie with my daughter and it was cute and fun! In fact, it sparked a great conversation about Paris and traveling. We made a plan to go there together after she graduates high school! I thought this was a clean movie (other than one of the characters using the word ""ass"") that was suitable for my daughter. The scenery was breathtaking and we enjoyed it very much!",1319414400,46,541,4.211538461538462

on my other flights.
what a cheesy story, what a stupid plot, I like chick flicks from time to time, but this was sooo bad.
The boyfriend (Owen) following the girl - taken directly from ""Only you"", and all the other tricks taken from other, better movies.
The characters were one-dimensional, the movie felt almost like a cartoon.
The girls were pretty, and costumes and sets glamorous, but this is no reason to spend almost 2 hours watching garbage of a movie.",1318809600,8,558,4.534653465346534
