5856940,5,B00DUX28RC,"Here's an event that was thought to be a bad idea that would only give way to mayhem and violence.  Instead it brought together more than 250,000 people to show their support for equal rights for all.  During this historial event, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr gave his ""I Have A Dream"" speech, which today, still brings tears to my eyes.",1389139200,,335,4.475409836065574
5856941,5,B00DUX28RC,"This 58-minute film (a co-production by PBS, the BBC and French TV) aired on PBS recently but is now on DVD. It is a must-have for all libraries and public school history classes. It does an excellent job is fitting the important event that took place in Washington, DC on August 28, 1963 but including virually anyone still living who was involved in the organization of the event.
If I feel there is one fault in this production, it is that it is too brief. Most of the celebrities and other well-known persons interviewed are given less than 15 seconds to make their comment. But, I guess that the film will work better for those with short attention spans. SOME - not even all - of those interviewed are: Harry Belafonte, Joan Baez, Peter Yarrow, Julian Bon, Sidney Poitier and - the requisite OPRAH! (who was just nine years old then). Longer interviws come from John Lewis, CBS newsman Roger Mudd and a few authors. Denzel Washington provides the narration.

The DVD contains no bonuses (a study guide would certainly have made this even more useful)

What can I say more? This was a major moment in US history (I attended the second one in 1968) and the film gets all the important people who organized it on camera - with excellent archival footage - to tell the story.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5856942,5,B00DUX28RC,This was the famous event where the Reverend Martin Luther King implored American's not to judge people by the color of their skin. So what was the governmental response? It set up groups for special preferred treatment based entirely on....you guessed it....the color of their skin. Behold the affirmative action movement and the related set asides which are provided to people of certain skin colors. King would be so ashamed of how the civil rights movement has morphed into something completely inconsistent with his wonderful ideas.,1381449600,2,537,5.255813953488372
5856943,5,B00DUX28RC,"I was 16 years old when the peaceful March on Washington occurred. This documentary was inspirational and it flowed smoothly. It reminded me of what a unique and rare event it was. For such an important point in history when so much had occurred before and after August 28, 1963, the film does justice to the subject of civil rights in a relatively small amount of time.  The film highlights many people who were behind this event, in addition to Dr. Martin Luther King, including the 250,000 people of various races who came from all over the country to be seen, and to hear the speeches and music.  For those who were too young to understand what was happening fifty years ago to people my age and older, this film is educational, thorough and effective in showing progress that has been made with civil rights in the U.S. It also makes clear how far we still have to go for racial equality, integration and equal rights for all minorities.  This is an important documentary of a remarkable event and moment in time, see it!",1377648000,5,1026,4.565217391304348

5856947,5,B00DUX28RC,Those giving any less than five stars should be ashamed to call themselves Americans. This film attributes one of the most pivotal times in our history as a nation. Nothing less is deserved and those giving it less need not be heard.,1412208000,,233,4.571428571428571

5856951,5,B00DUX28RC,"Made on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington (itself held on the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation) - this one hour film is a tremendously intelligent detailed and moving exploration of what led up to that march - the planning, the controversies, the personalities, the compromises, the politics, the passion - that culminated in Martin Luther Kings I Have a Dream speech -- one of the rare pieces of oratory that helped change the very course of history.

But while most of us know Kings speech, and its powerful effect on America, few, myself included know the history of how the march came together, and the many other heroes besides King - from famous leaders to simple office staffers - who gave so much to help make it happen.

Director Akomfrah (a long under known and undervalued film-maker) does a terrific job combining archival footage (much of which was new to me), very nicely shot modern  reminiscences of those who were there and part of making that day happen, and beautiful images that aren't so much re-creations as poetic capturings of the spirit of those people and that moment (a tremendously striking shot of a seagull soaring free amidst the towers of a modern city sticks in my mind).

A wonderful educational piece for younger people who might not know about The March and its impact, but with a great deal to offer even those of us old enough to grow up with memories from that time.  I didn't realize how much I didn't know, and thats one of the best things you can say about any historical documentary.",1407542400,,1558,4.713235294117647

8598051,5,B00DUX28RC,"The March, was an exceptional documentary. It tells an important story about African-Americans overcoming obstacles in order to gain freedom for the next generation. I'm 22 years old, so as I look back and learn about the leaders who sacrificed their lives for me to have more opportunities, I'm humbled and thankful. This story is essential for African-Americans to what as well as other cultures because it gives a historical context for what African-Americans have been through in the U.S and it is extremely relevant to where we are as a society today",1482969600,,555,4.978494623655914
