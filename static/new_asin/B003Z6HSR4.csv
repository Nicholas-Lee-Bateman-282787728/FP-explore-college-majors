8651830,1,B003Z6HSR4,"This movie was terrible. A poor, low-budget attempt with no production value. The filming/camera work was amateurish and clumsy. The performances were lacking and artificial. And then there were the oddly affected characters, like ""Sam the Man"", the gas station attendant (what WAS his deal?) or the librarian- c'mon, really? They just seemed inappropriate. Dialogue was at times awkward, and lines were often repeated exactly. And the plot, oh boy... *POSSIBLE SPOILER* Nothing supernatural, filled over-abundantly with absurd red herrings, and the LAMEST motive behind the events and climax. And the final ""twist"" at the end with the closet- completely pointless and superfluous.
Altogether a complete waste of time and $.",1435795200,,724,5.531531531531532

8651833,1,B003Z6HSR4,"When I first read about this movie, I was intrigued, and went out of my way to get a copy. It was a mistake! The story makes no sense and has more holes than a log of Swiss cheese. As for the cast, I've seen better acting in reality shows. This movie was just a big waste of time!",1361664000,,280,3.76271186440678

8651836,5,B003Z6HSR4,"And I have nothing to do with anybody associated with the movie as the poor review suggests. What kind of cheapskate rents a movie for $3, hates it, watches every  minute of it anyway, then asks for their money and the time it took to watch it, back. Then goes online to spend more time ragging it. I think it sounds more like a an actor or actress that missed the cut. I mean, who is that pathetic?

Anyway, I found it scary, and funny at times. Give it a go and if you don't like it...well, turn it off. Either way, it's worth the price...It's only a $3 rental or $9.99 purchase for Christ's sake. Don't be such a tight-wad.",1344902400,5,626,4.1652892561983474
8651837,1,B003Z6HSR4,"The other reviewer must be involved with the production of this film (and I use the term loosely), because this movie is GARBAGE!  Unfortunately, I paid $3 for this mess on Amazon streaming via my Roku.  This is the first film I wanted my money back from Amazon!  I kid you not, it looks like it was filmed with a low-end camcorder, I've seen better acting at my daughter's middle school, and the storyline is a bore and obvious.  Yes, I am upset!  I want my 90+ minutes and my $3.00 + Texas sales tax BACK!!!!!!!!!",1343779200,5,515,4.322916666666667
8651838,5,B003Z6HSR4,This is a great retro-thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat! Soon to be a cult-classic! I love it!,1285113600,5,105,3.8181818181818183
