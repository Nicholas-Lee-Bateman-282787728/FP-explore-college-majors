This film is a monumental ode to the power of will , tenacity and high  freedom spirit , a homage to the best a man can do when he's persuaded for get that goal under the worst conditions.

The story is simple. A prisoner makes his first attempt for escape and he's back to prision. But he's convinced with such passion and inner power that his fellow realize about that and help him for his achievement. He creates a vortex around him and thanks to that magic poetry of this unique film maker all the efforts made will prevail at the end of the road . The presence of the teenager is a complement of the masterful vision of Bresson.

Lyrical and surrounded for arresting images, a perfect script , under the direction of the master of masters, Robert Bresson.

562554,5,6303077781,"For viewers who have never seen a Bresson film this is an excellent one to start with because its like a student notebook of all the strategies he will put to use in his two early masterpieces Diary of A Country Priest and Pickpocket. Its a prison escape movie which focuses on the inner monologue of Fontaine from the time he is captured and tortured(which we don't see)until the escape but along the way he befriends several other prisoners and each prisoner is there for a different reason and there is very little unity among them and very little hope. One man overhearing of Fontaine's escape plan mutters ""freedom"" as if the word meant nothing any more. Each day shots are heard and each one knows it is only a matter of time until his turn will come. One prisoner finds solace in his bible and there is a religious quote or two which no doubt will reverberate with the religious minded and Bresson was a devout Roman Catholic but Fontaine is not particularly religious and he finds his very elaborate escape plan a means of keeping his mind occupied and his hopes high despite the overwhelming odds against him. We watch him as he carves at his door and as he winds ropes out of braided bedsheets and makes hooks from his window casing and its fascinating to watch because his life depends on it. There are fatalists in the prison who just accept that this is the end but not Fontaine. Its about as simple a story as can be told and yet there are interesting layers in this film. In such circumstances one is forced to come face to face with what kind of man one is and what one truly believes. In some ways Fontaines sanity lies in the fact he does think too much, he stays busy. This is as good a philosophy as any other.  There is no greater incentive to make his every effort count than the one this situation presents. In the last scenes Fontaine is given a cell mate just before he is to make the big break. In just a few conversations he must take an accurate measure of this man who is only a boy and decide whether he can trust him with his plan. Once again its a life and death decision and he takes a leap in making the decision he does. From the cellmates perspective he has lucked out being put in a cell with someone who has an escape plan all ready to go.  The actual escape makes you hold your breath and when they scale the final wall and take their first steps of freedom you find yourself as exhausted/exhilerated as they are. The later Diary of A Country Priest(also told mostly in inner monlogue) is not for everyone as it deals with the religious life in a way which will probably only interest those who have some interest in the topic. This film and Pickpocket will appeal to all audiences. Bresson's later films become more and more cynical and if you've seen some of them like Lancelot of the Lake(1974) or L'Argent(1983) this one is a refreshing one to come back to.",1044144000,7,2900,4.37847866419295

  (...)
It seems strange to me that Robert Bresson referred to himself as a ""Christian atheist"", because God is very much present in this film.  A
Man Escaped is based on the true story of Andr Devigny, a member of the French Resistance who managed to break out of prison just
hours before he was to be executed by the Germans.  The movie begins with the prisoner, here called Fontaine, being driven to jail.  The
men beside him are cuffed, but he is not.  He tries to get away when the car stops but is recaptured and beaten about the head.
In prison, Fontaine nearly succumbs to despair, fearful that his fellow Resistance fighters will be rounded up too, but then a stranger
intervenes, a prisoner exercising in the courtyard who promises to get a note to them.  Relieved of this concern, Fontaine once again sets
his mind to escape.  While other men remain bound either physically or mentally, Fontaine develops a detailed plan of escape and
arduously sets about implementing it.
Bresson presents Fontaine's machinations in painstaking detail.  He also confines most of the film to Fontaine's cell, so the viewer too
feels like a captive.  Seemingly forgotten by the Germans, Fontaine delays his escape attempt.  He believes that two people will be
required to make the attempt work, but is unable to convince anyone else to join him.  He is himself afraid to take the leap of faith that it
requires, seemingly waiting for a sign that he should go ahead.  The sign comes quite suddenly in the form of his death sentence, his
crimes not forgotten after all.
But now, just when everything seems to have fallen into place, another prisoner is placed in the cell with Fontaine, a very young man
whom he has every reason to distrust as a stool pigeon, planted at the last minute by the Germans.  His execution scheduled for the next
day, Fontaine has but two choices : kill the boy or include him in the escape.  Once again Fontaine has thrust upon him a matter of faith.
His resolution to this problem and the ensuing escape are exciting stuff.  The very sparseness of the film and the way Bresson strips it of
emotion, makes the action, as he intended, speak for itself, and it speaks volumes.  But there are also big ideas at work here, the most
refreshing of which, particularly coming from a Frenchman in the 1950s, is that faith and hope matter and that we can take some control
of events through our own actions.  The most famous image of the French intellectuals' view of life is the example of Sisyphus, as per
Albert Camus.  Sisyphus, a Titan sentenced to eternal punishment for rebelling against the Gods, has to push a boulder up a hill all day,
and at the end of the day, just as he arrives at the top, it rolls back down again.  Bresson's film is perhaps best understood as a refutation
of this fatalistic and futile worldview; A Man Escaped suggests that indeed we can escape the fates, can create our own destinies, if only
we have faith and make the effort.  The impetus remains with us, even if the ultimate outcome remains in the hands of ""The Spirit"".

562716,5,6303077781,"Robert Bresson is probably the most revered film director the world has ever seen and for me alongside Andrei Tarkovsky he is simply the best. He only made 13 feature films spread over some 40 years and each one conveys a vision of the world unique to its creator. Iconoclastic to the extreme, he made films which are distinctly audience non-friendly. A film for him was never a piece of entertainment, never a canvas to divert audiences from everyday realities, never a commercial endeavor in which investors could confidently give their money and expect returns. A film for him was a brutally honest work of art, an article of faith, a statement of the deepest metaphysics that underpin the human condition. He didn't care whether audiences liked his work or not. He arrogantly and unequivocally stuck to his guns, absolutely refusing to compromise his vision in any way at all, confident that he was right in everything he said and did even down to despising the films of everyone except his own. It took guts, a huge ego and incredible personal sacrifice to accomplish what he did, but the fact is now the great man is no longer with us we can look back at 13 extraordinary works of art which bewilder and perplex, shock and depress, disgust and repel, and yet which also inspire and illuminate, move and awe, excite and exult. Put simply Bresson takes us to places and shows us things which nobody else does. The average Bresson work (one hesitates to call one a mere film) runs an average of 90 minutes, but those 90 minutes are at once so exhausting and so exhilarating that one emerges from the viewing experience drained, beaten, worn out, but also enlightened and uplifted in the most profound way.

I don't propose here to go into Bresson's world in depth. For that I recommend people new to and curious about the director to read Alan Pavelin's excellent short survey in the Great Directors section of the Senses of Cinema web site and explore the other articles there about him. Then if you really want to jump in at the deep end Bresson's 1975 book, Notes sur le cinmatographe (Notes on the Cinematographer) is mandatory reading. For now before I get onto the film under review I briefly want to draw attention to four things which viewers might find helpful in defining the world according to Bresson:

1. Catholicism. Bresson was born and raised a French catholic. He later described himself as `a Christian atheist', but there's no doubting the strong influence of predestinarian Jansenism across all of his work. Time and again Bresson protagonists simply function in any given narrative to fulfill whatever has been pre-destined for them to fulfill. They have no free will of their own and usually the film charts a journey which becomes a metaphorical search for spiritual grace. Conventional character psychology has no place in a Bresson work - it doesn't matter what happens between life and death, the result will be the same - such is the nature of pre-destination. We are taken on this journey together with any given protagonist and are made to feel as they do as they approach salvation.

2. Prison. Bresson was a member of the French resistance and was imprisoned by the Nazis as a POW during World War II. He learned at first hand how it feels to go without, the mental strength it takes to survive difficult circumstances. Prisons appear at some point in most of his films and two (A Man Escaped [1956] and The Trial of Joan of Arc [1962]) take place completely behind bars. The universal metaphysical yearning for freedom, for personal betterment, for spiritual rejuvenation, for release from one's constraints whether they be social, marital, material or of another kind, becomes probably the strongest theme in any given Bresson film.

3. Painting. Before taking to film-making Bresson was a painter and these years informed completely the austere mise-en-scne that would become uniquely his own from Les Anges du Pch [Angels of Sin] (1943) through to L'argent [Money] (1983). As Pavelin has said painting a picture is all about deciding what to include in the frame whereas making a film is all about deciding what to exclude. Bresson excludes everything except what is absolutely essential for any given shot even to the extent of excluding narrative information through ellipsis and use of off-camera sound which constantly makes the audience work hard to get at the meaning. Framing in a Bresson film may seem perverse. Often we see shots of hands and feet disconnected from the bodies to which they are attached and the framing of empty spaces into which characters walk (usually head bowed) is a Bresson trademark. Everything is spare, stark, gray and determinedly austere. Watch and listen carefully because every image is packed with so much detail. Events may pass by completely unawares if you are not paying attention. The painterly austere Bresson aesthetic distances us, forcing us to work hard to interact with the narrative in a way other directors simply do not do.

4. Models. Connected to his austere visual aesthetic is the way Bresson eschews professional actors, employing amateurs who he termed `models'. He distrusted trained actors who brought with them baggage from prior experiences which would inhibit the naturalness that he was after. Not only does he use amateurs, but he has all of them behave (they never `act') in the same way, talking quickly in a monotone, expression blank and unsmiling. His models are manipulated by their puppet master down to the last detail - one step here three steps there. No acting is involved, and yet his films are full of quite extraordinary performances. The models are a natural extension of the style which Bresson is so concerned should address the ideas beneath the narrative rather than the narrative itself with its irrelevant consequent traditional character development omitted completely. `Acting' disappears along with any kind of associated melodrama in a Bresson film.

All of these themes are most admirably displayed in Bresson's 1956 prison escape film Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (A Man Escaped or: The Wind Bloweth Where it Listeth). This is the film I would suggest people new to the director should see first. The narrative is simple, the story obviously uplifting and uniquely approachable in Bresson's work for having a happy ending. The film is a true story based on the memoirs of Andr Devigny (named Fontaine and played by Franois Leterrier) which chart his escape from Montluc Prison, Lyon in 1943 during the Nazi occupation. Imprisoned for his involvement with the resistance movement, Fontaine at first enters the prison bleeding and seemingly near the end. The next 98 minutes chart in minute detail his recovery and then his escape. The narrative structure is based on a first person voice-over and Fontaine is consequently in every scene. The only time we see other prisoners or the German guards is when he comes into contact with them which he does rarely. The bulk of the film takes place inside his cell where he first sets about breaking through his door and then onto the roof and then over the walls to reach freedom. The film is the essence of simplicity and would seem dull in any other hands. In the hands of Bresson however the journey becomes one of the most uplifting and awe-inspiring in the whole of cinema. How does he do it?

The film's very title gives away Bresson's Jansenist aesthetic. `A Man Escaped' bluntly states what will happen in the course of the film and an inscription shown after the credits tells us that Fontaine's story will be related in the simplest terms with no embellishment. So traditional notions of dramatic suspense are discarded from the start - we not only know the ending, but we also know the treatment will be prosaic. Fontaine's future has been predestined, but as the film's biblical subtitle (The Wind Bloweth Where it Listeth [John 3:8]) makes clear it is up to him to make his own luck and win freedom through his own endeavor. The film is therefore a demonstration of how one man makes a bid for liberty but is helped/hindered by the guiding hand of `fate' that hovers over him throughout and that finally delivers him to his goal. The film becomes a strongly stated article of faith on the part of Fontaine, and because we see everything through his eyes through the first person narration, watching him becomes an article of faith for us as well whatever our religious persuasion may be.

The film's visual treatment is remarkably concentrated throughout. The very first sequence again echoes predestination. Fontaine is sitting in the back of a car being driven to prison. Two prisoners next to him are cuffed but he is free so he waits for the car to stop to open the door and escape. The camera stares closely at his hand hovering over the door handle in expectation. We hear street noises and the sound of the engine, the only indications of the car's movement. Bresson gives us the odd glimpse of the street, first a cart pulls out in front of the car. Will it stop? No, it simply drives around. Then a train crosses in front and finally the car has to stop. Fontaine seizes his chance and exits the car. Normally the film would follow our hero and we would see his recapture. Not so Bresson. Instead the camera rests on the empty seat Fontaine has just vacated waiting for his return. With no other gesture needed we know he is destined to failure and to a return which he duly fulfills. Arriving at the prison Fontaine is taken to a room and beaten with clubs. The camera points down. We see the bottom of a door open, clubs resting against the wall and Fontaine's body dragged past. The door closes, the camera fades and we see him (probably at least an hour later) dragged bloodied and bruised into a cell. We don't need to see him being beaten. The visual treatment intimates the shock much more effectively than any explicitly visual violence ever could. In this cryptic manner Bresson articulates the pitch black darkness from which Fontaine endeavors to escape throughout the rest of the film.

One could go through the film scene by scene, shot by shot and underline all the ways Bresson deploys his extraordinary visual system and equally stunning use of off-screen sound. Such a David Bordwell-type approach has its merits I suppose, but I think it essential in a short review to emphasize just two things for the film's powerful message to be understood. The first is the way human contact and the spread of brotherly love not only helps Fontaine, but also how Fontaine helps those around him in return. Note the way his efforts at contacting his neighbor go unanswered at first - efforts which later we learn stopped the man from committing suicide. The old man Blanchet (Maurice Beerblock) visually regains his life force by hearing and watching Fontaine go about his escape. Finally he even donates a blanket to help Fontaine and wishes him luck. Then there is the character of Orsini (Jacques Ertaud) who is inspired to attempt a similar escape, the priest (Roland Monod) who inspires hope and faith in everyone around him and then most importantly the boy Jost (Charles Leclainche) who Fontaine is forced into taking with him on his escape and without whom he would have failed to scale the final wall. Fate works in mysterious ways indeed and Bresson's film is extraordinary in the way it quietly but very precisely depicts the escape as a spiritual search for salvation which succeeds through taking strength from one's fellow man and also by giving strength in return. Fontaine's escape is the beacon of light which gives hope to everybody, to his fellow inmates, but especially to us the audience. We are fed a succession of dreary and ugly scenes of prison life which concentrate completely on the promise of final emancipation which is offered up as perhaps the sole most important meaning of life.

Secondly, we should pay attention to the way Fontaine turns everything around him into things which he can use for effecting his escape. There is an important scene where the priest says he has found a bible which gives him spiritual fortitude. Behind the bible lies a spoon sitting on a ledge which Fontaine informs us in voice-over is the thing that gives him his spiritual fortitude. By connection all the things that he uses to effect his escape - the spoons, the wires in his mattress, clothes and blankets cut up to make ropes, the room lantern frame bent into hooks - are religious artifacts which serve to highlight those qualities needed by all men to survive whether they are in prison or not. Watching him fashion his escape we recognize the qualities of attention, concentration, hard work, practicality, skill, patience, perseverance and above all else - faith and the conviction that success will be won. All of these are essential life qualities which he inspires in the other prisoners around him and in us the audience. It's no exaggeration to say that watching Fontaine in this film is a hypnotic experience. You simply cannot take your eyes away for fear of missing something and the obsessive focus on him at the expense of everything else is what gives this life lesson of a film its extraordinary metaphysical power.

One last thing that should be mentioned is Bresson's astounding mastery of sound, both on and off-screen. There is the occasional burst of Mozart (the Kyrie from the Mass in C minor, K.427) which is extraordinarily effective (especially at the end) because it punctuates long periods of near silence where the only sounds are distant bell chimes and street car clanging - the quiet throb of a city going about its daily life beyond the prison walls. Once on the roof we encounter an extraordinary series of night sounds, most prominently coming from the nearby railway station, then the sounds of a bicycle being ridden by a guard and the twangy electronic sound of a wire caught inadvertently by one of Fontaine's hooks. This prepares the way for the truly exultant final moment of release - a brief embrace with his escape partner Jost and a quick walk across the nearest bridge as the Mozart once again swells on the soundtrack. It's a deceptively simply release of all the pent up tension of watching a man working a miracle in exacting slow motion over the duration of the film. I watched it in a crowded cinema with a rapt audience and the sense of emotional release was palpable as everyone clearly shared in the man's epiphany. Absolutely stunning, there is no other ending in cinema like it - a journey from deepest darkness into the most radiant light. Perfection.

This Artificial Eye disc is very good quality. The visuals (aspect ratio 4.3 - 1.33:1) are very sharp and clear while the Digital Dolby mono soundtrack is excellent for the period. The only extra offered is a 45 minute Dutch documentary made by Leo de Boer and Jurrin Rood entitled 'Road to Bresson'. It offers interviews with Louis Malle, Andrei Tarkovsky, Paul Schrader and the great man himself. It was made at the time L'argent won the Cannes Palmes d'Or, a prize shared with Tarkovsky's Nostalghia and we get to see both directors receiving their awards on stage. It's interesting, but not particularly revealing about Bresson. The disc really needs a scholarly commentary. But I am not complaining. This is an excellent release of a truly unmissable film.",1411430400,,15421,4.8257088846880904

562830,5,6303077781,"""A Man Escaped,"" (1956). This is a classic of French cinema, a dramatic war story of just 100 minutes.  In it, French director Robert Bresson - using  a deceptively successful minimalist approach -- brings high drama to the screen.  Bresson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Au-Hasard-Balthazar-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00092ZLEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Au Hasard Balthazar (The Criterion Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-a-Country-Priest-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000127IF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of a Country Priest (The Criterion Collection)</a>)  is able to tell this true story of Andre Devigny,  a French prisoner, and his single-minded determination to escape from a Nazi prison cell in occupied France during World War II, with great economy. To tell his tale of the Resistance, Bresson, who was awarded Best Director  at the Cannes Film Festival for the film, used amateur actors and little dialogue or music, while keeping his camera almost constantly  focused on the prisoner's desperate bid for freedom.  The director does use snatches of Mozart's Great Mass in C Minor, No. 16 (K.427) -, the Kyrie, in a few scenes at the picture's beginning.

To ratchet up the suspense, on the same day that Devigny is condemned to death, he is given a new young cellmate. Must he kill the young man?  Or, as he believes the escape will be easier done by two than by one, should the Resistance leader risk revealing his plans to someone who may be a Gestapo informer?

Bresson, who insisted on as much authenticity as he could get, based his screenplay on a memoir by Devigny.  The former prisoner also served as advisor on the film, which was shot in the same Montluc prison in which Devigny had been held, in the vicinity of Lyon, where both Resistance and Gestapo were extremely active during the Occupation.  Devigny even loaned Bresson, who had himself been a prisoner of war during WWII, the ropes and hooks he had used in his escape.

In reading about this movie, I expected to dislike it.  Black and white, amateur actors, not even any music, virtually the entire picture filmed in a jailhouse.  And then there's the title: if you know the prisoner escaped, how suspenseful can the film be?  It was tremendously suspenseful, could barely tear my eyes away from it.  Tremendously exciting.  I'm sure that in film schools all over the globe, students are dissecting this motion picture, trying to figure out how it works.  This, I am not qualified to do.  All I can say is, I recently saw a Batman movie, with its computer generated effects.  A MAN ESCAPED  was more exciting.",1372204800,4,2699,5.466183574879227

562832,5,6303077781,"Robert Bresson, a legendary French filmmaker known for cinematic maserpieces such as ""Pickpocket"", ""Diary of a Country Priest"" and his most popular film ""Au Hasard Balthazar"".

But Bresson was also known for his film ""A Man Escaped"" (""Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut""), which was based on the memoirs of Andre Devigny, a prisoner of war that was held at Fort Montluc by the Nazi's during World War II and escaped on his day of execution.

The film would earn Bresson a ""Best Director"" award at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival but also a Palme d'Or nomination.

VIDEO:

""A Man Escaped"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio). The film features wonderful contrast and is well-detailed. Whites and grays are well-contrast, black levels are also much better. I saw no damage or major flickering, banding, if anything, the film looks magnificent on Blu-ray!

According to the Criterion Collection, this high-definition digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original 35 mm camera negative at Eclaire Laboratories in Epinay-sur-Seine, France. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image System's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""A Man Escaped"" is presented in French LPCM 1.0. Dialogue is clear and subtitles are easy to read. I detected no pops, crackles or terrible hiss during my viewing of the film.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remaster at 24-bit from a sound negative. Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Robert Bresson, a legendary filmmaker who may have not made too many films within the last 40-years of his life, but each of his films are respected by filmmakers because of his constant search of getting the shot he needs.

A style that is not for patient producers, Bresson is known to have a seen redone and shot many dozens of times until he felt he got the shot he needed.  As many filmmakers would say about Bresson's style, he comes to a shot not knowing what he wants, but through repetition he eventually is in search for a shot that can be used.

He was a man that was dedicated in refining the precision of his own cinema style, stayed away from professional actors, abolishing psychology and suffice to say, those who understood his work, looked at Robert Bresson as a genius, while those who didn't, find his work maddening or incomprehensible.

While Bresson's style is not a style that not many people could read about or hear about, it is because he shunned the public life and wanted to be known for his work and not about him, as a person.

Known for his masterpiece ""Au hasard Balthazar"" and his work for""Les dames du bois de Boulogne"",  ""Diary of a Country Priest"", ""Pickpocket"" and""Mouchette"", the Criterion Collection gives viewers a chance to know Robert Bresson the filmmaker through the Blu-ray release of  ""A Man Escaped"".

While I recommend films such as ""Au hasard Balthazar"", ""Pickpocket"" and ""Diary of a Country Priest"" to see the varying styles of Robert Bresson as a filmmaker, I must say that the release of ""A Man Escaped"" is important for the fact that it's a film that shows his technique of simple concepts but techniques that are not easily replicated.

This is also a release that features Bressons' first on-camera interview in ""Bresson: Without a Trace"" from 1965, the wonderful documentary ""The Road to Bresson"" in which legendary filmmakers such as Louis Malle, Andrei Tarkovsky, Paul Schrader and others discuss the brilliance of Bresson but also seeing those who just don't get his work (as seen in the ""L'argent""press conference at the Cannes Film Festival).

But Criterion Collection goes even further by including ""The Essence of Forms"" featuring those who have collaborated with Robert Bresson but also ""Functions of Film Sound"" in which film scholars David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson discuss Bresson's work and the use of sound in ""A Man Escaped"" with efficacy.

But for his film ""A Man Escaped"", description on paper or this review makes everything seem so simple.  In fact, that is a word that is often used with Robert Bresson's films is ""simple"", but yet not easily replicated.  Remember, Bresson is a filmmaker who will keep filming do-overs as many times as he wants to get the right shot. His films have gone over schedule, gone over budget and he has even bankrupt a few producers because he has a style that requires patience.

For this prison film, a French Resistance leader has been imprisoned by the Nazi's and as life is futile for those incarcerated and just counting the days when they will be executed, the protagonist Fontaine is using his contacts throughout prison to find out details of what he can do to escape. Using anything that he has access to, may it be a spoon, blankets or shreddings to be used for rope, the film is exciting because you want to see this man escape.  We know it's based on a true story based on the memoir of Andre Devigny, but we must see things visually to fully understand.

Bresson captures Fontaine's urgency, his sadness, his fears and displays it on camera.  Bresson's skill as a filmmaker is not to be obtrusive but also having the audience be part of the film through tension, suspense and emotion, not just visually but also through its carefully planned use of audio.

This is fantastic cinema and in his talented list within his oeuvre, while he has many films that can be labeled as a masterpiece, ""A Man Escape"" is wonderful, but it's the overall experience through this Blu-ray release that makes it worthwhile for the cineaste.

The Criterion Collection's presentation on Blu-ray is fantastic.  Wonderful detail and contrast with picture and audio quality that looks unblemished and for a film that is nearly 60-years-old, fantastic.  But of all the Robert Bresson releases from the Criterion Collection, it is this release that gives Bresson fans a chance to truly know the filmmaker.

Overall, ""A Man Escaped"" is a film that showcases Robert Bresson's wonderful direction but it's also a Blu-ray release and its special features that Robert Bresson fans and cineaste will surely enjoy for it.  These are the type of Criterion Collection releases I love...great film and special features that thoroughly examines the work of the filmmaker.  ""A Man Escaped"" is highly recommended!",1364601600,7,7851,4.996156802459646
562953,2,6303077781,"I sat down on my big chair in the living room and changed the station from CNBC where I had been watching the stock market. I used my DVR (digital video recorder) to pull up this film, ""A Man Escaped"" and proceeded to watch the film. The film was broadcast on TCM on April 23rd. I recorded it automatically because the theme (escape from the Nazi) is one of my favorite film themes. My dog jumped up on my lap and settled in....

If you're getting bored with this commentary, it's merely a sample of the dreck that you will be exposed to when you watch this film. To merely say that it is boring is not sufficient to describe the lost 90 minutes of my life spent watching it. When a film is this bad, my initial reaction is disbelief, and I tenaciously stick with it in order to see if the film makers are merely lulling me into position to then turn on the steam. But alas, most films that fail to capture you in the first 10 minutes rarely snap back, and this one is no exception.

Basically the film is the story of a French resistance fighter who escaped from a Nazi prison in Lyon (Fort Montluc) in 1943. It is directed by French director Robert Bresson who himself was a POW during the war. It's shot in black and white, and nearly all of the film is a voice over from the prisoner about his life in prison and his escape plan. There isn't much character development nor are the prisoners and guards particularly interesting. In fact, there is nothing particularly interesting, including the escape plan.

For people who like the more measured approach, this film may be of greater interest and in fact, may be very appealing. There is a lot of detail and the long periods of inaction do give us a feeling for what it must be like to actually be there. In this sense, the film is probably more accurate than most of the action films I prefer.

If you're interested in prison escape films, my favorites list includes - ""The Escapist"" (2008), ""Stalag 17"" (1953), ""The Great Escape"" (1963), ""Papillon"" (1973), ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932), ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), ""Midnight Express"" (1978). ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) ""Escape from New York"" (1981), and for a change of pace, ""Life"" (1999).",1335398400,6,2214,4.4727722772277225
562954,5,6303077781,"""A Man Escaped"" is the type of movie that needs little dialogue. For it is the tension in carrying out the plan that holds a viewer spellbound.  With Mozart's Great Mass in C minor accompanying scenes, you feel as if your watching a masterpiece. The score really sets the tone in the opening scene.

Take away all the disturbing events and occurrences that mormally go into a prison movie. Instead, have the events take place mostly in the narrating mind of one prisoner bent on escape.  This is ""A Man Escaped.""  The film features a cool, calculated and courageous man using ingenuity and determination to escape from a nazi prison in occupied France.  As you watch this man struggle with himself through the emotional ups and downs of attempting to beat death, you find yourself sharing everything he feels along the journey; distrust, hope, fear, defiance, despair, comraderie, hesitation, determination.

It is the stillness and silence this movie depicts that gives it strength and courage.  I liked it a lot.

Great review excerpt from IMDB:
Narrative stripped down of all melodramatic trappings, the film manages to reveal a larger truth about man's struggle against unknowable odds, his struggle with himself, and his resolve to move forward. A couple of the side-characters are from the church, or pastors, which give the ongoing conversations in the common areas an added resonance to ""grace"" and a possibility of transcendental deliverance. Even though the lead character doesn't seem to truck much with religious faith.

He has his own - in his resolve to escape.",1327449600,2,1575,5.026923076923077
562955,5,6303077781,"This film is about the imprisonment and escape of Robert Bresson during World War II. What makes this film different from many escape films is that it strives to recreate the enormous challenges that a prisoner had to overcome to achieve his freedom. The Mozart musical score matches the emotional highs and lows that Bresson experienced at different times during his ordeal. The director/writer shows how his contacts with other prisoners caused Bresson to constantly readjust his original plans; though aware of the sufferings of his fellow inmates at the hands of the Nazis and their French helpers, he continues to move forward with his plan, learning from his prisoner friends' failings and bits of information about the prison. The climax of the film is very inspiring, and it is presented in a direct and exciting way.",1319846400,,825,5.029197080291971
562956,5,6303077781,"`The wind bloweth where it listeth.' God will only save us if we give him a hand, thus says the Resistance fighter who has been condemned to death. He has luck on his side and the fates for the narrowest of margins. He has other prisoners aware he is about to make a break and they both urge him to go or to take caution. Un Condamne a mort s'est echappe, is the film as art form reduced to its purest elements, based as it is on the true story of Andre Devigny,who was imprisoned and sentenced to death by the Nazis during the 2nd World War. Imprisonned in a spare cell at the Lyons Fortress of Montluc he watches everything closely and plans meticulously, making pencil notes and obtaining spoons to act as chisels and clothing and mattress material to make ropes, and bending metal from his light surround into hooks. He taps on his cell wall to communicate with a neighbouring prisoner who thinks he hasn't a hope but gives his blessing. He also has found a contact in the prison yard to get letters out to his family.

Fontaine(Leterrier), impassive and inscrutable , has total command of the 3 by 2 metre space he inhabits, with the eyes of a vigilant bird and we get an image of his hands chipping, banging, bending,platting. Our vision is limited to what he can see-a small part of the prison yard, the outer corridor and downstairs in the yard when the men empty their pots and have a wash in the communal wash-house daily. We also only hear what he hears, the approaching foot-steps or the noises of men being taken from their cell to their execution in the yard. Bursts of machine-gun fire. Orsini, in the cell opposite escapes too early and is soon executed. The innate hope and humanity of the prisoners surfaces as they struggle for meaning beyond their captivity. This is a thrilling tale of courage and faith transcending physical limits through iron purpose and sensitivity soft as a feather and a final liberation with a moving denouement to the accompaninment of Mozart's sublime Mass in C Minor.",1272153600,2,2015,4.566298342541437
562957,5,6303077781,"I only recently watched this film for the first time yesterday. Being a Bresson fan, I can't believe I waited so long. Using his spare, ascetic style, Bresson achieves levels of near-unbearable tension. The emphasis on the arduousness and banality of Fontaine's escape preparations are fascinating. As a viewer, you really come away with a sense of time. Despite this emphasis on banality, the film still blisters by.

For those who have tried Bresson in the past and didn't warm to the likes of The Pickpocket, The Devil Probably or Diary of a Country Priest, I would recommend giving him one more shot. Although it contains typical Bresson elements, it's packaged together in a more easily enjoyable way.",1264464000,,706,4.983050847457627
562958,5,6303077781,"The Bottom Line:

The film that really showcases how effective Bresson's minimalist style can be (unlike Pickpocket, but that's another story), A Man Escaped details the spectacular escape Andre Divigny made from Fort Montluc during World War II, never showing too much or too little of the story; if you like prison movies or want to get into Robert Bresson, try to find A Man Escaped.

562960,4,6303077781,"I'm a great admirer of Bresson's films.  I appreciate his simplicity, and his refusal to churn out ""professional"" films that have little substance or artistic merit.  His ""Diary of a Country Priest"" is one of the best films of the twentieth century.

But it seems to me that his ""A Man Escaped"" is flawed.  The film is a pretty straightforward cinematic parallel to a memoir published after WWII of the imprisonment and escape of a French resistance fighter.  In putting the story on film, Bresson uses a voice-over that reads portions of the text while showing scenes in which the actors perform what's being read.  The upshot is that the effect is slightly pedantic--not enough to make the movie a bust, but just enough to be noticeable, thereby rupturing the film's flow.  The viewer doesn't need to hear the main character tell you that he's filing down his dinner spoon so that he can make a chisel out of it while he's filing down his dinner spoon to make a chisel out of it.  There's a strange redundancy here for a director well-known for his minimalist approach.

On the other hand, the cinematography in this, as in most of Bresson's films, is excellent.  It's also the case that the actors, all of whom were nonprofessional, are quite good.  So ""A Man Escaped"" deserves three and a half--and maybe a full four--stars.",1220313600,2,1328,4.705627705627705
562961,5,6303077781,"I first saw ""A Man Escaped"" in my Introduction to Cinema Studies course during my freshman year at college. It immediately became one of the greatest films I had ever seen. Over time, my feeling on it has evolved to the point that it is now one of my favorite films as well. The story is told in a sparse, visually narrow style that forces the viewer to imagine as well as simply watch. The prison is never seen as a whole; we are only shown pieces of it--a wall, a doorway, and so on. The German prison guards are more often only heard as footsteps coming to Fontaine's cell door. Rarely do we venture outside of Fontaine's cell once he is imprisoned, and when we do, it is usually to the same place, where he washes himself with the other prisoners. With the exception of the end, the plot of the movie revolves entirely around Fontaine's plan and exeuction of an escape. The magic of the film is that Bresson makes these minutiae indescribably watchable; we are invested in Fontaine's every action through the whole of the film, and we watch with anticipation as he grows closer to his goal with each passing month, day, minute. ""A Man Escaped"" is a beautifully rendered work of cinema, and it will appeal to everyone who wishes to do more than while away the time seeing a simple 'movie'.

As to the New Yorker DVD listed here, I'm afraid it is severly lacking in quality. The print used is dirty and dark, and the transfer itself suffers from a poor PAL to NTSC conversion that results in 'combing' and 'ghosting' (For those not technically inclined, this basically means that the film runs faster than an American film, but the difference in speed was not properly accounted for, causing a sort of blurriness in some scenes). There are also no special features, save for a few trailers for other Bresson films. As of the date of this review, the New Yorker disc is $26.99, and in my opinion that is simply too much to pay for a DVD that is this mediocre.

My suggestion is this:

A company in the UK called Artificial Eye has just released a new DVD of ""A Man Escaped"" this April. The picture quality is greatly improved and, because the UK uses the same PAL encoding system, there was no need for a conversion, which eliminates the combing and interlacing problems found on the New Yorker disc. Besides that, there is also a wonderful Dutch documentary (with English subtitles) called ""The Road to Bresson"" which is almost an hour long and features interviews with Andrei Tarkovsky, Louis Malle, and Paul Schrader amongst others. There is also footage of the notoriously camera-shy director accepting his award for Best Director (for ""L'Argent"") at the 1983 Cannes film festival. Finally, the documentary includes a delightful surprise at the end which I will not ruin here. On Amazon.co.uk the AE DVD is priced at 11.98, which is actually cheaper than the New Yorker with the current conversion rate. The disc is coded for Region 2 in the UK, so it will not work on a TV or DVD player in the USA unless both the TV and DVD player have multi-region capability and you have a PAL to NTSC converter box. However, the disc can be viewed on any PC by using any of a series of free media players widely available on the internet that circumvent region coding.

In short, if you value this film as much as I do, and want some value for your money, then skip this disappointment from New Yorker and pick up the Artificial Eye release instead.",1210118400,2,3442,4.537842190016103
562962,5,6303077781,"Bresson's spare but breathless film mesmerizes with the ring of truth. Based on Andre Devigny's own harrowing story, the prisoner's dogged efforts serve as powerful testament to man's ingenuity and will to survive. Leterrier is excellent as Fontaine (based on Devigny). Often unbearably suspenseful, this title offers large rewards in a small, understated package. Don't let it escape.",1182729600,,385,5.655172413793103
563053,3,6303077781,"""On my right, no one.  An empty cell.  On my left, a neighbor who didn't answer my tapping."" So the French prisoner tells us in this film as we look at him (in black & white) in a concrete cell.  We rarely see the few German guards in this film and we hear almost nothing from them...or from anyone besides our prisoner and a few of his fellow inmates (when they are throwing out trash together or washing up). 80% of the dialogue in this film is actually a first person monologue, actually (which hardly conveys the tension others characterize this film as having more than its fair share of).

From a spoon he holds back from soup our prisoner tells us, ""I made a kind of chisel.""  ""I couldn't work fast,  because of the noise I made and the constant fear of being caught.  I kept having to sweep under the door with a piece of straw from my broom.""  ""I kept on working.  It stopped me from thinking.  I had to open this door.  I had no other plans."" ""Three boards would give me room enough.""  He tells us of he neighbor's silence scaring him then.  ""I plugged up the holes with paper I'd soiled on the floor.""  ""After three weeks, working as quietly as possible,  I was able to separate, lengthwise, three boards.  But they were still in the frame, fastened by joints which bent my spoon.  To dislodge them from the frame I needed another spoon.  Only then could I force them hard enough.""  Then we see two spoons employed after he swipes another during an intervening scene.  ""I busted the frame, but more than I'd intended.  I was able to put the piece back in place.""  ""After one month's work my door was open."" (Perhaps half of the speech of this film's 100 minutes passes by in this manner.)  Then, in this instance,  we see him slide a panel in the door and lift it out of line and put his face up to the opening.

During all of the above explanation, by the way, the director gives us close-ups of what is actually happening and what this prisoner is actually doing at the moment.  The dialogue, thus, you could say, is rather redundant throughout most of this film.  We don't see much besides the prisoner's cell, a room with sinks, a courtyard and sundry hallways.  Mind you, the film does build, to some extent, to its denouement, but it ends rather abruptly.  All in all, it was worth watching, in my opinion, but then again, It didn't cost me anything to view ""A Man Escaped."" By all means buy this film if such is your inclination, but I believe you'll be more satisfied having simply rented it (if possible).  Cheers",1170028800,2,2533,4.373390557939914
563054,5,6303077781,"French director Robert Bresson who also wrote the screenplay, based on the wartime memoirs of Andre Devigny, fashioned an enthralling, nervewracking recounting of an elaborate prison break during the height of WWII.

Francois Leterrier playing Lt. Fontaine is captured by the Nazis in 1943 Lyons for sabotage of a bridge.  After being beaten severely by the Gestapo, he's thrown into prison to await his fate.  While being incarcerated within a claustrophobic cell he conjures up a plan to escape.  He begins by taking apart the door to his cell gaining him access to the corridors of the prison.  He constructs ropes and hooks with the meagre contents of his tiny abode.

With his plan finally complete after many painstaking months of preparation, he is summoned for his final judgement.  Given a death sentence he must act immediately, when he suddenly gets a cellmate, a young Frenchman who he must either bring along or kill.

Bresson adroitly creates an aura of solitude and severe unease with a minimum of dialogue in this underappreciated flick.  He expertly conveys the desperation of Lt. Fontaine as his very existence hangs in the balance.",1157068800,2,1150,5.042328042328043
563055,5,6303077781,"A Man Escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings. Bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator, which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape, but in other respects it's a perfectly contained and executed movie.

The performances are very strong (Bresson was still aiming for naturalistic performances at this time) and the Christian allegory - that we want redemption but instinctively back away from it - is not overstrained: although this time round I noticed a few more references to religion than I recalled, it's there if you want to see it but never at the cost of turning the movie into a sermon.

The film has gone through various video, DVD and Blu-ray incarnations. New Yorker's source material for their deleted NTSC DVD is not especially good, but considering how bad most 35mm prints that go round the revival circuit are, it may well be a case of making the best of what material was available to them. Artificial Eye's UK Region 2 PAL DVD is a distinct improvement on New Yorker's version. Although it doesn't have the unsubtitled trailer included on the US release, it does have a good 54-minute Dutch documentary, The Road to Bresson, and superior picture quality. The French Blu-ray from Gaumont is very impressive, though the extras are unsubtitled - something rectified by Criterion's excellent edition on DVD and Region A-locked Blu-ray tha includes the trailer (subtitled this time), The Road to Bresson documentary, and documentary The Essence of Forms, episode of Cineastes du Notre Temps - Bresson Without a Trace, offering Bresson's fist on-camera interview, visual essay Functions of Film Sound and booklet.",1141516800,,1893,5.006349206349206

This was a copy with a lack of contrast, extra noise on the track, looking like a dub.  If only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice.

563057,5,6303077781,"Based on a true story, Andre' Devigny, a member of the French Resistance was imprisoned by the Germans and set to be executed, so he  skillfully plots his escape.  He narrates his plot with detail.

The stark black and white confinement of the prison is haunting.  The camera often places the viewer in his small prison cell and often looking out.  It is quiet.  Prisoners line up only to wash up and outside their line up to empty their pots of waste.  It is reported that French Director, Robert Bresson himself was imprisoned and that this knowledge slowed him more expertise.

No violence viewed
Apprehensive about prison movies, I don't want to see brutality, but there was absolutely none in this movie.  We often hear the sounds of gunfire.  When the man made his first escape, we only see him with blood dripping from his head.  And, the only other time was when he literally had to kill a guard, we only know the guard was killed; and we aren't sure how he did it, what happened, or how long.  It is just done and over.

Suspenseful.
Simple as that, this was extremely suspenseful and tense.  Throughout the movie, we have hope that he will escape, but each time he plots something, we are driven into the thrill of anxiety and suspense.  There is no music to enhance the suspense; we are on our own.

But people who've only seen that sort of movie should see the power of slow accretion of details precisely added in the way that Bresson tells the story of A Man Escaped.  The lack of extraneous entertainment and perfect presentation of the main story forces viewers to appreciate the building drama.  I wonder if the constant visual distractions of some films aren't because the director knows he can't do what Bresson does.  The tension is fantastic by the time of Fontaine's escape and it's tremendously moving when he succeeds.",1123372800,2,724,4.661417322834645

563060,5,6303077781,"This is the first Bresson film I ever saw and it stunned me.  Since then, I have seen most of his other films and each one is remarkable, though a few stand out: Diary of a Country Priest, Au Hazard Balthaaar, Pickpocket, L'Argent.  Still, this film is unique in that it retains the austere, minimalist and ultimately spiritual style of the others, and at the same time is a gripping thriller.

You might say of this film -- though Bressonian purists might hate me for saying this -- that Bresson uses his anti-Hollywood style to outdo Hollywood style.  What I mean is: Bresson is known for revealing only what is absolutely essential, a gesture, an item, two hands engaged in an activity, feet walking.  This has the effect of encouraging the viewer to pay attention, but also, because it forces no specific interpretation upon these items, encouraging the viewer to participate in the unfolding of events, and become more than merely a spectator.  Hollywood style tends also to eliminate much of what is inessential, but to a much different end: to eliminate moments where the viewer might be distracted and think about something other than the film; the aim is to replace thought with the action on the screen, rather than to stimulate thought.  In the case of this film, however, where the subject matter is a prison breakout (standard Hollywood fare) the minimalist style employed by Bresson is able to achieve both a high degree of tension, and a high level of involvement.  From the moment the prisoner is in the prison, nothing is shown except what is relevant to the single-minded focus of the prisoner: to escape.  In that sense, it is not at the end that the man escapes (as already announced in the title of the film), but from the very beginning he is escaped in the sense that he never accepts the status of imprisonment.  The film is able to show this without ever having him discuss the matter with anyone.  Remarkable.",1117324800,57,1935,4.712166172106825
563061,5,6303077781,"A true masterpiece of cinema.  This film not only showcases some of the best sound work done ever in film history, but showcases a true character perspective masterpiece.  The way it is shot and the way it is stylized goes incredibly well with the plot and storyline and everything meshes incredibly well to the point where you become completely immersed with it and forget your watching a movie.",1111190400,,396,4.8088235294117645
563062,5,6303077781,"There is a great deal of naturalism, and a great economy of style, in Robert Bresson's A MAN ESCAPED.  Clothes are dirty and unfamiliar faces unshaved.  Non-professional actors come within a shade of convincing us it's a documentary, and not art retelling a `true event', that we are watching.

  I've been leery of foreign films boasting an amateur cast.  Not only do I have to chase subtitles, but I don't think they can pull it off.  Might as well sent junior out to videotape a high school play.  I enjoy good acting too much to feel otherwise.  It's with those conditions that I flipped this dvd into the tray.  By the end of this GREAT movie my opinion had turned about completely.  I'm convinced that this is not a movie Hollywood, or anyplace with image conscious stars, could have pulled off.

 The story, the director assures us on an opening card, is `true and unembellished.""  A French resistance fighter is imprisoned by the Germans in a Nazi-occupied Parisian prison. The movie documents his plans to escape.

  The hero, who looks an awful lot like a young Alan Alda, spends most of his time alone while delivering a voice-over narrative.  A smart use of an amateur actor with an expressive enough face.  His tone is flat, as are the brief conversations he has with his fellow inmates over the wash stalls, which last until an off-screen guard barks `No talking' or `Keep quiet.'

  As a general rule professional actors don't play `flat' very well, even when the story demands it.  A MAN ESCAPED is appropriately gray and subdued.  A full palette of emotions would have been out of place.

  Highly recommended, especially for fans of movies dealing with World War Two.",1103328000,14,1685,4.720689655172414
7838045,5,6303077781,"Some say that 1956's A Man Escaped (Un condamn  mort s'est chapp) is French director Robert Bresson's best work, his pice de rsistance. Not much argument from me, although I like Balthazar, at Random (1966) and Mouchette (1967) just as much. Bresson was a lifelong practitioner of minimalist cinema. Any more minimalist and he'd be shooting a wax museum. He kept it more real than a thug-life rapper. Bresson wanted no truck with theatrics in his moviemaking.  He prefered to work with non-actors because he felt an actor can't help but dabble in artifice.

This was a very personal project for Bresson. Seventeen years before the movie, Bresson himself was held captive by the Nazis for more than a year and a half. But A Man Escaped is based on the experiences of another hombre, real-life WWII French Resistance fighter Andr Divigny who broke out of prison, escaped, was captured again, and broke out again. Non-actor Franois Leterrier plays Fontaine, a captured lieutenant charged with espionage and with plotting a bomb attack. Fontaine, we learn right away, is the sort of man who will snatch at any opportunity to escape. He's got his job cut out for him, a prisoner-of-war held in the Gestapo prison in Lyon, deep in occupied France.

Bresson's austere storytelling works hard to ratchet up the suspense. We're privy to each methodical step of Fontaine's escape plan. Fontaine, by the way, is dang lucky there's a door to his cell, instead of iron bars, this allowing for a measure of privacy. We observe how he takes note of what he's got to work with, and how he assembles the tools he'll need, and, finally, how he executes his breakout. It's exciting that Bresson plays it fair. He ensures we see only what Fontaine sees and know only what he knows. At the eleventh hour, with our man learning he's condemned for execution at any day now, Fontaine gets a cellmate, a smelly, unkempt French teenager (Charles Le Clainche) conscripted into the German army. Fontaine, wracked with paranoia, must wrestle with a sudden dilemma: does he kill the boy who may be a mole or enlist him in his escape attempt?

Most other movies have dramatic scores to help cue you emotionally. Composer Bernard Herrmann's collaborations with Hitchcock is a great for instance. As well, the actors' dramatic choices alert you. Robert Bresson sneered at all that. With A Man Escaped, he presents a slice of stark reality as conveyed thru spare usage of scoring, and thru the uncompromising prism of black-and-white cinematography, and, of course, thru his repertoire of non-actors, all absent of flair and artifice. The end result is that what unfolds in A Man Escaped goes down like the real thing. In real life, there is no sweeping crane shot to establish mood, no sudden camera pans to heighten suspense, no rousing soundtrack to garnish one's victories. Bresson distills the plot to its ascetic elements, strips it down to a restrained study in self-sufficiency and acute cerebral calculation. As it were, Fontaine's situation is fraught with enough nerve-janglers that there's no need to embellish it with movie magic dust. We're made very aware that the man is betting his life that he'll get everything right the first time. Man, what does he do with the boy? What would you have done?",1503187200,,3278,4.877917414721724

7838048,5,6303077781,"From the beginning to the end, Robert Bressons masterpiece grips your mind with thrill and suspense. A Man Escaped is one of the greatest of all prison-break films, including Jacques Beckers ""Le Trou,"" John Sturges' ""The Great Escape,"" Alan Parkers Midnight Express, Don Siegel's ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" and Frank Darabonts The Shawshank Redemption. In Lyon of Nazis-occupied France, a French resistance leader tries to escape from the inescapable Montluc prison. Robert Bressons stoic mastery and cold-blooded realism make the leaders desperate digging for freedom look sublime. This documentary-like film will never fail to offer a memorable movie experience to those who are greedy for both entertainment and artistic satisfaction.

7838054,5,6303077781,"A prison escape film that is pure Bresson.  Spare, deliberately paced, avoiding all the usual tricks of the cinema to heighten suspense (music, flashy editing), yet it feels so real and honest in its understated way, that the tension at times can be almost unbearable.

A captured French resistance fighter in WW II awaits execution at the hands of the Nazis afraid, confused (this is no Hollywood hero, but a real human) he nevertheless contrives to find a way to escape before he is put to death.  We watch him plan and prepare, slowly, methodically, as one would have to do, and yet with a ticking clock always bringing him closer to doom.

Beautifully and simply shot, with strong performances (Bressons penchant for nonprofessional actors meant that on occasion his work can be hindered by a weak performance, but thats not the case here).  More accessible than some of Bressons work for being less metaphorical, this might be a good place to start for someone interested in first sampling the work of this great French film-maker.  I look forward to seeing it again.",1460246400,3,1072,4.830601092896175
