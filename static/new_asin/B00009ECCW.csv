The first scene starts out with a professional guide who is not miked properly or lit, who can't be understood and who talks way too long about something which if used at all should have been edited down.  The announcer is definitely not professional.  The editing is horrible. It just looks mostly like someone took a tour and this is their home video.",1136592000,13,455,4.512195121951219
