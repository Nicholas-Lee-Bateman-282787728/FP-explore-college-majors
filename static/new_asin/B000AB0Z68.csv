Yet, as this film demonstrates, almost as soon as World War II started, Holywood started cranking out films about the evils of the Nazis and the heroics of allied forces.

I wonder if, perhaps, this isn't because that without television news, the war in Europe seemed more abstract and fanciful than the current war does with it's pictures of real battles on the television every night.

This is one of the first World War II movies made after Pearl Harbor and it shows. We don't see a lot of Americans involved in teh fighting - mostly because we had yet to train and ship out very many soldiers.

Instead, you see the allies in battle - which is clearly meant to prepare Americans for what would happen to their soldiers a few months later.

Other that that it's a typical war movie with a spy twist. The bottom line is that they need to rescue a man who has become trapped in Nazi occupied Norway.

You get the typical battle footage and spy talk, but it's more interesting than a lot of similar films. That's because it's shot in a pseudo serial manner - so it comes off like an early episode of 24 - which leaves you on the edge of your seat before the  next thrilling episode is about to start.

This is a very interesting film with a good deal of suspense.

It is also very well restored and the sound quality is excellent.",1164585600,,1480,4.352727272727273

They Raid By Night is one of the first and best examples of this genre of Pro-War Cinema. The deal of this one is that they need to rescue a solider stuck in Norway before the Germans get to him.

As you would expect they carry off the raid by night and spirty him away to Germany one step ahead of hte Nazis.

The production values are very high and there is a minimum of dialogue and a good deal of suspense. The remastering is well done with well synched sound.",1146528000,,678,4.1603053435114505
