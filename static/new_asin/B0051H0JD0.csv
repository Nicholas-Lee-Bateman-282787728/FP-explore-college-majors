4522879,5,B0051H0JD0,"This is one of those movies that leave you shaken deep inside.  The reality of slavery, and the tragic effects on the psyche of those trapped therein (not to mention on the families torn apart).  Some authentic performances, striking cinematography, and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack to boot.  I would absolutely recommend this, and certainly plan on adding it to my collection. If there's a negative, it's that it was slightly too short. It's stated at the end that, according to estimates, there are some 5,000 slaves living in London households alone.  If remotely true, this is shocking beyond measure.",1334448000,8,610,5.1313131313131315

8452724,5,B0051H0JD0,"This dvd taught me two things: 1. the rating on origins ( this is a 2 origin) and 2. the search for dvd players that are not just
American programmed for our dvds. The movie was great and very informative, however, be certain you understand the properties prior to order. It will not work on American dvd set for origin 1. you must have a dvp player that accommodates all regions. 0-....",1409184000,2,387,4.388888888888889
8452725,5,B0051H0JD0,"Saw this film on Netflix and was blown away. Words to describe POWERFUL, RIVETING, SUSPENSEFUL, TENSE AND TRAGIC. Really great for a small film. It's very enlightening about what's going on in part of the world. The actress is beautiful and talented. The way it was shot was powerful too and emotion driving. I strongly recommend this film if you're looking for something of substance about the human spirit.",1408406400,,408,4.927536231884058

8452727,5,B0051H0JD0,"This was a movie that shed light on modern day slavery. I would have liked to have known what happened to this young girl at the end. As a Christian I would have liked to have seen her pray but considering where I think she came from they probably don't believe in God. I think this is a reminder for all that no one wants to be a slave and no matter how long a person is a slave they will want to strive for freedom for whom the Son sets free is free indeed (John 8:36)
I pray that God strengthens and puts a spirit of boldness and courageousness in people to help free those that they know who are enslaved.",1394236800,,609,4.0
