119854,5,079074676X,"an impressive musical tour de force with Robert Preston and Julie Andrews in their prime.  The story is whimsical and charming, with slapstick scenarios that elicit happy moments for viewers.  Andrews is, of course, beautiful and talented, and her singing superb.

119897,1,079074676X,"I bought this movie 6 years ago, & have watched it a handful of times since.  The movie itself is amazing.  Side-splitting laughter is guaranteed.

However, I can no longer watch it.  My DVD player (standard, not blu-ray) no longer recognizes it.  I loaned it to friends & they had the same issue.  It's now unplayable, & I'm exceedingly disappointed that I'll have to shell out more money for another copy.  It makes no sense why it's suddenly up & died.  There are no scratches on the DVD, & my player works just fine with all the other movies I have.  Additionally, this is the first movie that's lasted this briefly--in fact, I've never had to replace any of my movies--which is making me wonder if the production/distribution of this movie is somehow substandard.

I leave this for your consideration.  Buyer beware.",1507420800,,821,4.711267605633803

119945,5,079074676X,"This movie is pretty much a remake of Viktor und Viktoria (1933) which is still available on DVD from amazon.de. However there is a character (Blake Edwards as Charles Bovin, Private Investigator hired by Labisse) that distracts from the movie by using too many slapstick scenes that do not fit the story.

Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews) a starving out of work legitimate female singer. She meets also out of work singer Carroll Todd (Robert Preston). Due to an extraordinary event a plan hatches in Toddy's mind he suggests that Victoria pose as a man pretending to be a woman in order to get work. Victor Grezhinsk (Julie Andrews) the Polish aristocrat female impersonator meats promoter (James Garner) who is at odds as to his/her gender. After a sneak peek he knows the difference but what about his big time gangster buddies?

Many top actors and singers. You find singing ranges that very few people can match in Julie Andrews. Leslie Ann Warren is like a shiny toy. There are way too many great actors to mention in this review.

You will like the story. You will like the singing ""Crazy World"" outshines the movie. You will want to watch this over and again.",1502668800,,1166,4.733990147783251

120034,5,079074676X,"Victor Victoria (1982) is a musical comedy (I'd say mostly comedy) that stars Julie Andrews, James Garner, and Robert Preston. It's a film that depicts homosexuality, as well as gender ambiguity (is she a man or a woman?) This film is sort of politically incorrect (as you might expect), as it maintains a realness among its characters. While watching this film, some scenes reminded me of the first two Pink Panther movies from the 1960's, with comic mischief (voyeurism, running from room to room, hiding, etc.) This film also reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffany's (another Blake Edwards film) with its humor and romance. One thing that is special about this film is its consistency; it never hits a low point, and things move well for film that's well over two hours in length. Julie Andrews delivers a great performance as Victor/Victoria, and is very believable in her role. This is one of Blake Edwards' best films, and I'm surprised that it doesn't get more recognition; I think it's a classic. The critics loved it, and the general public seems to love it as well (movie musical fans). I think it was released during a recessionary period of the movie musical, a genre that would be resurrected in 2001 with Moulin Rouge. Overall, Victor Victoria is great entertainment for those who love good comedy with some musical numbers thrown in. It's still a classy film amid all the confusion! The special features are rather limited, with a commentary, and a trailer. There's also a song list to choose from, and selecting one will take you to the part of the film that features the song.",1485820800,2,1590,4.785454545454545

I have been waiting for this movie to be released on Blu-ray since the format's inception, and now it has finally happened.
And what a release it is: Excellent video quality and great audio quality.

I couldn't detect any compression-related artifcats. Not even banding. Such a great release.
The audio is terrific for its age as well. Some parts are a bit harsh, but never ear-piercingly so. It's a 35 year old movie after all.
Surround activity is quite limited, but the sound is full, and there are some nice discrete surround effects as well.

Extras are disappointing to say the least.

Either way, this movie is such a hoot. The funniest musical ever made, and possibly Blake Edwards' best film!

Get it now, as the error has already been taken care off by WB Archives.

But it is Robert Preston who is the true star, singing, dancing and clowning his way through this movie. Blake Edwards of Pink Panther fame was a great comedy director, a master of physical comedy as well as verbal timing. James Garner is perfect as the love interest and Alex Karris as his bodyguard. The blu-ray is not demo quality, but it preserves a film that definitely needs to be in safekeeping for future musical comedy enthusiasts.

The stage show version has been available for some years but this is the first time the film has been on Blu-ray, and the transfer is very good, and includes the wonderful commentary first heard in the DVD version.  I don't say this easily, but in my opinion, -all- of the lead actors were at the top of their game in this film, and Lesley Ann Warren for instance won an award for her performance.  In scenes where they are shown watching night club performances - watch their faces.

The film was both made and set in times when LGBT issues were far more controversial even in the secular world than they are today, and it explores some of the feelings involved compassionately but pragmatically, but in common with gentler sensibilities of the time, does not show any nude or overtly sexual scenes.
The film is really about a diverse group of people who meet through the night club scene in 1930s Paris, in a climate of theatrical gender bending, at a time when night clubs afforded gay people and transvestites a freedom they would not otherwise have.
However although a few of the lead characters are gay, most of them are just straight people trying to find their way through life and the novel complications of this social environment.  And this is where the film really scores, because it treats their journeys sensitively and with an infectious humour and inclusiveness (no-one is left out), that leaves you with a wonderfully warm feeling.  And it uses music to do this, and -what- music.

This is one of those musicals with really memorable songs, including a few I could have sworn I already knew, but that is their strength that they can make you feel that way.  It is also a showpiece for Julie Andrews' amazing voice, which, in the song ""Crazy World"" (which also doubles as the theme tune) covers one of the widest ranges in pitch you will ever hear.

Even the sets are marvellous, with deliberately crafted colour schemes to complement the drama,

Is she a woman pretending to be a man, pretending to be a woman? Or is he a man, pretending to be a woman, pretending to be a man? Piece of cake. But a woman whose livelihood depends on pretending to be a man who pretends to be a woman? Now youve got problems! Youve also got laughs when Dame Julie Andrews plays Victor and Victoria in this clever delight, from filmmaker Blake Edwards, boasting a marvellous Academy Award winning score by Henry Mancini and Leslie Bricusse.

Robert Preston plays a cabaret performer who devises the gender-bender stage act. Farcically complicating matters are James Garner as a mobster suspecting Victor is a Victoria and Lesley Ann Warren as a short-fused floozy.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: VICTOR/VICTORIA [1982] finds Dame Julie Andrews stars as a struggling Paris cabaret singer who becomes the toast of the town when she goes on stage as a female impersonator Victor/Victoria in the 1933s Paris. As the favourite of the nightlife in Paris where Victoria Grant [Dame Julie Andrews] acts as female impersonator Count Viktor Grezhinski and Carole ""Toddy"" Todd [Robert Preston] brings her all the fame and fortune she could ever desire. Then tough-guy Chicago gangster/nightclub owner King Marchand [James Garner] walks into her cabaret. Sparks fly as the two are inexorably drawn to each other ... but King Marchand doesn't realise that the object of his desire is a she, impersonating a he, impersonating a she. And Victoria cannot reveal her ruse without risking her celebrity and success. Now, as this screwball musical comedy from director Blake Edwards careers to a wild climax, genders will bend, secrets will be revealed, closets will open and hearts will melt.

Henry Mancini won one of his four Oscars for the tuneful comedy VICTOR/VICTORIA [1982], sharing the award with lyricist Leslie Bricusse for Best Original Song Score. The MGM-UA film was a remake by producer-writer-director Blake Edwards, and was based on the German 1933 UFA-Film VIKTOR UND VIKTORIA that was conceived by Hans Hoemburg and written and directed by Reinhold Schnzel (18861954). VICTOR/VICTORIA starred Dame Julie Andrews as a poverty-stricken soprano trying to find work in turn-of-the-century Paris. With the guidance of a gay entertainer Carole ""Toddy"" Todd [Robert Preston], she creates an alter ego named Victor, a ""man"" who performs as a female impersonator. She/He becomes a hit and falls for a guy King Marchand [James Garner] who's troubled about his attraction because he thinks Victor is a man.

Along with the laughs and Henry Mancini's music, VICTOR/VICTORIA offers amusing observations about gender perceptions and the nature of sexual attraction. Writer-director Blake Edwards originally conceived the film as a vehicle for Dame Julie Andrews, wife of Blake Edwards, and Peter Sellers who was another frequent Blake Edwards collaborator. After Peter Sellers's untimely death in 1980, and Robert Preston stepped into the role of the irrepressible Carole ""Toddy"" Todd, giving one of his liveliest screen performances and winning an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor. Robert Preston also says one of the most prophetic and funniest lines in the film when he says to Dame Julie Andrews, Shame is an unhappy emotion, invented by piteous in order to exploit the human race.

The vocal numbers in the film are presented as nightclub acts, with choreography by Paddy Stone. However, the lyrics or situations of some of the songs are calculated to relate to the unfolding drama. Thus, the two staged numbers ""Le Jazz Hot"" and ""The Shady Dame from Seville"" help to present Victoria as a female impersonator. The latter number is later reinterpreted by Toddy for diversionary purposes in the plot, and the cosy relationship of Toddy and Victoria is promoted by the song ""You and Me"", which is sung before the audience at the nightclub.

The songs that really stand out for me in this brilliant tour-de-force comedy classic film are the following:

01.""Gay Paree"" [Robert Preston] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

02. ""Le Jazz Hot!"" [Dame Julie Andrews] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

03. ""Home on the Range"" [Robert Preston and Dame Julie Andrews] When both of them are in their hotel room.

04. ""The Shady Dame from Seville"" [Dame Julie Andrews] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

05. ""Chicago, Illinois"" [Lesley Ann Warren] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

06. You and Me"" [Robert Preston and Dame Julie Andrews] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

07. ""Crazy World"" [Dame Julie Andrews] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

08. ""The Shady Dame from Seville [Finale/Reprise] [Robert Preston] Music composed by Henry Mancini.

VICTOR/VICTORIA was eventually transformed into a Broadway musical in 1996, again written and directed by Blake Edwards and starring Dame Julie Andrews. By then the star Dame Julie Andrews appeared to have made peace with the role, that despite her dazzling success with it, and had troubled her at the time the film was made. ""There were so many things to be worked out,"" she said. ""As someone who likes to be in control, I felt wobbly. There was something else, too: When you get older, you kind of get on to yourself. You know the tricks you play to get by, and you like them less and less if you care about your work. I was trying hard to get away from them and was sometimes falling back.""

VICTOR/VICTORIA is a delicious charade; director, Blake Edwards taking the magical romantic chemistry so eloquently evoked in such classic outings as Breakfast at Tiffanys [1961] and The Pink Panther [1963] to their lithe extreme of champagne cocktail effervescence. In a decade buffeted by cynicism and crass sex comedies, VICTOR/VICTORIA harks back to another vintage in regal elegance of a 1980s sex comedy per say, and undoubtedly one of the first to frankly treat homosexuality and homosexuals with respect, not merely as subtext, backdrop or figures of fun. And Blake Edwards homage and premise of the 1933 German film into a financially successful remake/reboot/update for the then beleaguered Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has also managed a minor artistic coup; making it a musical at a time when musicals were sincerely dreaded and pass. In hindsight, one might ask how such an enterprise could fail with Dame Julie Andrews and Robert Preston at the helm. Yet, this is a last hurrah for both these talent actors, tragically so for Dame Julie Andrews, whose supposedly routine throat surgeries have since deprived us of her miraculous vocal gifts. The Henry Mancini and Leslie Bricusse score has its moments; particularly Le Jazz Hot which is a real sizzler with Dame Julie Andrews seemingly effortlessly popping out ascending and descending octaves.  Dame Julie Andrews also acquits herself of the sad-eyed and oddly dreamy, Crazy World a really luscious ballad. Dame Julie Andrews and Robert Preston are the epitome of mirth,  locked at the elbow as they warble, You and Me, while Robert Preston gives us the very Cole Porter-esque Gay Paree with all the debonair grace of a really classy showman.

Robert Preston had not appeared in a big and splashy Hollywood musical since 1974s disastrous and costly, MAME. Certainly, Robert Preston had not known success in the genre after his Oscar-winning turn in 1962, reprising his stage role as everyones favourite con, Prof. Harold Hill in Meredith Wilsons The Music Man. Herein, Robert Preston is having an indubitably good time; and his caricature is never mean-spirited or over the top. Robert Preston is a genuine, if very hot Carole ""Toddy"" Todd indeed; a twinkle of petty larceny caught in his eye, supremely satisfying as he gesticulates with arms spread wide; a vivacious old queen. And Robert Preston and Dame Julie Andrews have that illusive, infectious and curiously bromance spark of onscreen chemistry. Whether they're embracing the implied subtleties of Gay Paree or simply exchanging loaded barbs from Blake Edwardss brilliantly nuanced screenplay, together they crackle with airy wit and smart sophistication; a pair of hams sufficiently cured to carry the premise off without a hitch.

This witty, energetic film is one of the best and most memorable efforts in the accomplished career of Blake Edwards. The story's fusion of screwball comedy and musical review is a potentially unwieldy combination, but Blake Edwards manages to make it work with a thoughtful script that weaves rich characterisations into a carefully-constructed but sprawling plot that gives them room to breathe. VICTOR/VICTORIA is lengthy but never feels overlong thanks to Blake Edwards's stylish work behind the camera, where he excels at crafting complex slapstick set pieces but shows equal skill with the film's many rousing musical numbers, especially the highlight is a stunning cabaret number called ""Le Jazz Hot."" Blake Edwards's work is ably supported by the film's handsome production values, which include a dazzling Henry Mancini score full of memorable cabaret  tunes and excellent cinematography by Dick Bush that adds just the right veneer of Hollywood glamour. However, the true appeal of VICTOR/VICTORIA lies in the magnificent performances that add heart to its combination of style and wit. Dame Julie Andrews finds the right combination of vulnerability and cynicism to make her demanding double role work, Robert Preston brings warmth and razor-sharp verbal wit in equal measure to his role as her protector, and James Garner is a subtle delight as the mobster who is forced to re-evaluate his concept of masculinity. The film also features plenty of scene-stealing supporting performances, especially Lesley Ann Warren's turn as King Marchand's oversexed mistress and Alex Karras' deadpan work as King Marchand's surprisingly sensitive and perceptive bodyguard. All these elements gel together beautifully to create a film that manages to work as a valentine to the screwball comedy and musical genres while also adding thoroughly modern theme of social and sexual tolerance into the mix. As a result, VICTOR/VICTORIA manages to feel classic and progressive all at once and this duality makes it one of Blake Edward's finest cinematic achievements.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Archive Collection have finally brought us the ultimate version of this brilliant and hilarious funny film of this new Blu-ray release, which is an improvement at every turn, with an amazing and terrific 1080p encoded image transfer, plus an equally impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio that reveals a lot of fine detail and accurate colour reproduction, compared to the inferior 1982 DVD release. Previous versions of VICTOR/VICTORIA for DVD have been sourced from a 1080i master made in 2001 and approved by Blake Edwards. However, for the Warner Archive Collection Blu-ray debut, created a new interpositive, which was scanned at 2K for VICTOR/VICTORIA first-ever 1080p presentation. The earlier Blake Edwards approved master was used as a reference for colour-correction, along with other archival resources, that does full justice to Blake Edwards's widescreen compositions, including the many long shots of precisely staged physical comedy. Skin tones and contrast levels look really excellent and the black levels are greatly improved, while the film grain and textures are much more noticeable as well and are ""consistent"" in the best possible way. Simply put it, die-hard fans should be enormously pleased for the opportunity to have a top-notch presentation of VICTOR/VICTORIA [1982] film release on this brilliant and ultimate Blu-ray release, as it's easily one of the best-looking film title I've seen in a very long time. VICTOR/VICTORIA was photographed by British cinematographer Dick Bush, B.S.C. and made a conscious decision to light VICTOR/VICTORIA warmly, even when the characters are cold and wet, which casts a jovial fairy-tale sheen over the proceedings. Optional English SDH subtitles are also included, but they're garishly printed in ALL CAPS for some odd reason.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Archive Collection have finally done us proud in giving us a superb audio and ultimate 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience. Not to be outdone is the film's audio of VICTOR/VICTORIA is very much dialogue-driven but features no shortage of show-stopping performances, so it's good to know that this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track holds up really well. Vocals and other foreground effects are crystal clear on almost all occasions, plus a few obvious post-production slapstick effects are a little thin by design, while the music cues and background ambiance sounds are with excellent detail and strong presence. It's generally mixed well but small portions of the dialogue are a little quiet, which means you might be reaching for your remote on several occasions. Either way, this is a fine presentation of difficult source material, or the addition of a Song Selection on the Blu-ray disc's main menu is a welcome touch. VICTOR/VICTORIA was released theatrically with a matrixed Dolby Surround mix built from four discrete channels, meaning left, centre, right and mono surround. The soundtrack was remixed in a 5.1 configuration from the DVD, and the same sound mix has been used for this Blu-ray release. The surrounds are employed primarily for the instrumentation of the musical numbers, but they sound terrific and the vocals have been well integrated. By the way, the sound of glass being shattered by Victoria's sustained B-flat is a running joke. Also Blake Edwards's favourite composer was of course the brilliant Henry Mancini, who wrote both the songs with the help of the lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and of course it has a really charming heart-warming score that is a joyous experience, so well done Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. Archive Collection.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The extras have been transferred over from the Warner Bros. 2002 NTSC DVD release and included a small ""DVD Easter Egg"" and the Theatrical Trailer has been remastered in 1080p. A few new extras would have been even better, but just having the old ones should please any die-hard fans of this film.

Special Feature: DVD Easter Egg [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [0:35] Titled ""Blake on Julie,"" this is a short excerpt from an interview with director Blake Edwards who talks about Dame Julie Andrews was not wholly convinced that her performance was any good and could not reconcile the fact, and Blake Edwards says that was always the problem he had to convince Julie would do a good job and especially convincing people when they viewed the film, that a woman is meant to be a man disguised as a woman and Julie kept arguing with Blake, but he kept assuring Julie to trust him as he knew Julie could pull it off and of course he was 100% right and surely winning all the awards must of eventually convinced Dame Julie Andrews that her husband Blake Edwards was right and had all the confidence in her performance.

Theatrical Trailer [1982] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:22] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer of VICTOR/VICTORIA. With its flashing graphics and quick glimpses of signature scenes, this is one of those rare theatrical trailers that really capture the spirit of this brilliant film it is promoting.

Audio Commentary: Feature-Length Audio Commentary by Dame Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards: As the film titles role, we get the personal introduction Dame Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards and welcomes us to this very intimate audio commentary on talking about working on the film VICTOR/VICTORIA, where they mention about the original German 1933 UFA-Film VIKTOR UND VIKTORIA, and because the film was based in Berlin, Blake Edwards felt it would be much better set in Paris in 1933, but before filming could start, they went all over Paris looking for locations, but because of difficult logistics and Blake Edwards felt filming on location would give the film not a good feel, especially recreating the flavour of Paris in 1933, so instead they located to Pinewood Studios in England, because it was much better option and they could control all aspect of the film, because Pinewood Studio had two huge adjoining buildings and gave a much better atmosphere to the film. Julie also wanted to praise the cinematographer Dick Bush, B.S.C. in creating something special with the lighting and colour. This is a very chatty and informal but informative audio commentary conversation between two long-time collaborators who also happen to be husband and wife. Dame Julie Andrews really felt Blake Edwards could really pull out all the stops and make a really special film and Julie says that Blake wrote the film with Julie in mind. Both recall the experience of making VICTOR/VICTORIA with great fondness, and their shared warmth in making this audio commentary is entertaining in its own right. Warner Bros. have scored quite a coup in getting Blake Edwards and Dame Julie Andrews together to do this very interesting audio commentary. Unfortunately it is very sad to hear Dame Julie Andrews's voice clearly not what it used to be, but despite this you soon get totally absorbed into this very chatty audio commentary. Both agree that filming everything, including exterior scenes on the Pinewood Studios combined soundstage, created a very nice cosy world for the story to unfold. The expense of doing this, especially with the quality of the sets that Rodger Maus built, led to concern from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at the spiralling costs. As Blake Edwards explains, musicals had become deeply unfashionable to be made in the 1982. The only reason the project got the greenlit was due to the faith of the then head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, David Begleman, who had great faith in Blake Edwards. As the budget rose quite considerably, David Begleman had to come down onto the set to see if the production could continue, but was so impressed with the quality of what was being shot, that David Begleman stood by his decision that the film should be continued to be made. When you hear Dame Julie Andrews singing Cherry Ripe as an audition for the club, comments that when Julie was a child, this song is what Julie use to sing. Julie says that with this film and the reference for Julie playing herself in playing the part of a man, pretending to be a woman would not work, but again Blake Edwards assure Julie it would work perfectly and kept on reassuring Julie was really doing a great job in creating the character and of course Blake Edwards stance paid off. Blake Edwards also talks about that in 1982 when the film was to be shot, felt that musicals were then pass, meaning they were no longer fashionable, out of date and not work in the climate of the time, but of course this was to be proved not the case. But again David Begleman had great faith in Blake Edwards and was convinced he could do a very professional job in shooting this film and was proved right, even though the other executives at M-G-M were not so convinced. When we see Julie arrive outside her hotel room and the Manager of the hotel intervenes in not wanting her to enter her horrible dingy room, and escribes the horror you are about to witness, which Julie describes in great detail, especially the fact that Julie had a deep abhorrent loathing for cockroaches and feels Blake was being very wicked to Julie in her fear of cockroaches, but of course Blake had an ultimate motive towards the following we see of the ultimate funny scene in the restaurant, where we get to see the chaos is caused by the cockroachs performance which is one of the truly funniest moments in the film. We are informed that Robert Preston was Blake Edwards first choice as the leading role in the film to play Carole ""Toddy"" Todd, especially as Robert Preston had work on a previous film directed by Blake Edwards, but we hear an intriguing anecdote about when Blake Edwards telephoned Robert Preston to be in the film and of course Robert Preston said instantly YES that he wanted the part, but Blake Edwards told him that he did not know the role he would play and still agreed, especially after Blake Edwards said he would be playing the part of a homosexual, he was still eager to be that character in the film, which shows you what a consummate professional actor Robert Preston is. Both Blake and Julie say that working with Robert Preston was such a joy to work with and on top of all that he was also a really lovely person to know. We find out the script was written and conceived by Blake Edwards in a record time of a month and Blake felt the words came really swift and fast, as he really felt a passion for this film as well as the storyline and really enjoying producing the script, which of course helped him enormously with the basic outline from the original film script that was jointly created by Hans Hoemburg (concept) and Reinhold Schnzel (1933 script). Blake Edwards and Dame Julie Andrews really praise the brilliant Henry Mancini and his really wonderful compositions for the film, especially creating wonderful background ambient atmospheric music. When we get some moments in the film where two people are having a conversation, Julie comments about Blakes wonderful script in creating beautiful intelligent words, especially when the conversation gets complicate. When near the end of the film Robert Preston appears on stage in drag, pretending to be Victoria and doing the ""The Shady Dame from Seville [Finale/Reprise] number, we are told that was all done in one take and also Blake Edwards allowed Robert Preston to do his own thing and had no interference and in doing so everyone had a fantastic time doing it and a totally brilliant twist for the end of the film. As the credits roll at the end of the film, Blake Edwards and Dame Julie Andrews comment on what a joy it was to view the film again after such a long break from seeing it when they originally saw it at the Premiere, and still feels fresh after all these years and they both feel they are watching someone elses film, but most importantly, Blake Edwards says that he feels very sentimental watching this film, compared to his other films he has made and is also very proud of this film, especially working with his wife Dame Julie Andrews, who also had great joy on working on the film and especially working with all the other people involved with this film VICTOR/VICTORIA. I also second this, as it is one of the BEST films to come out in a very long time and is so totally unique and special, especially now released on this Blu-ray discs, we can relive the total magic of something truly special and especially seeing it in the 1080p encoded image, because it is like viewing a brand new film for the very first time.

Finally, VICTOR/VICTORIA [1982] is a brilliant funny classic comedy film that has been LONG overdue for an ultimate Blu-ray release. The film has everything going for it, yet we are left with the current load of second rate films from Hollywood being released in droves. I have loved this film ever since I saw it in the cinema and I consider it as one of THE classic funny romantic comedies, which sadly they do not make anymore. The first time I saw VICTOR/VICTORIA I was bowled over by its unique approach to a unique and different kind of genre film, because the story line was totally unique and the musical numbers are just wonderful and joyous. It had three of my favourite actors in it, Dame Julie Andrews, James Garner and especially the brilliant, but sadly the late great Robert Preston. I also found that Leslie Ann Warren is very talented in this film. My favourite and I think the funniest number was the last one with Robert Preston, when he went on stage as Victor. If you like comedy musicals and a story line with a nice little twist, then you will instantly fall in love with this film VICTOR/VICTORIA. Blake Edwards was at the top of his game when he directed VICTOR/VICTORIA. The film has the chic qualities of Breakfast at Tiffany's and the sophisticated humour of the films of Ernst Lubitsch, and the hilarious slapstick of Blake Edwards Pink Panther franchise pictures. The director/writer blended these elements into a timeless and delightful treat for adult viewers. This glorious picture is colourful throughout both literally and figuratively, raising it well above the majority of current films in terms of entertainment value.

I have written a letter to Warner Bros. about it, and hopefully, they can fix it.  So, my 2 stars is NOT for the film (which is a bright FIVE STARS!!!), but for the error on the blu ray.  Here is my note to WB Archive Classics:

To Whom it May Concern:

I just purchased the blu-ray of Victor/Victoria, and I'm SO glad it's been finally released on blu-ray.  The film is just brilliant Blake Edwards farce at its finest.

However, there is an error.  I have watched this movie literally hundreds of times in the past 34 years, and know it like the back of my hand.  During the ""Shady Dame from Seville"" scene, there is a section that is inadvertently repeated.  During a dance interlude with her backup dancers, where Victoria weaves in and out of each of them before the matador bids her good bye on the fountain and she adjusts her cleavage, on the blu-ray, the kiss-off from the matador on the fountain is omitted, and instead, the end of the number, where she trills some scales while listing on her line of backup dancers, is repeated.  I thought that the blu-ray was wrong, and so to test it, I put in my DVD of  Victor/Victoria and ran the scene from the DVD...and the DVD has the correct sequence.

Is there any way you could look at this and correct it?  I'm certain Dame Julie Andrews would not want her work or, most importantly, the work of her late husband, the incredible Blake Edwards, to have been altered in any way, however inadvertently.

Thank you, and thank you again for releasing this classic in Hi-Def.  Should you correct the error and re-released it in is intended form, I will gladly repurchase this blu-ray again.",1467244800,20,1853,4.470238095238095

120226,5,079074676X,"It has been one of my favourite films since its release in 1982 and a constant thrill every time I watch it. As the years have gone by and my film repertoire grows, also my own knowledge of film; it becomes clear why this particular one is an all-time favourite. Blake Edwards comic timing has always been incredible since the Pink Panther films and beyond; he has a unique trademark style and he became an auteur of comedy satires. Many of his exceptional examples are A Shot in the Dark, The Party, 10, S.O.B, Skin Deep and Switch.

What stands out in abundance in Victor/Victoria are the classical and beautifully drawn out scenes that follow one after another, the dialogue that tickles the fancy and challenges the intellectual as well as the bigot in its unrelenting expression of all levels of homosexuality. There are incredible set designs, great acting and natural human expressions from the characters in key moments that are spot on. It is clear that these kind of truthful expressions that we see in Victor/Victoria coming from these great characters are missing in most of what we have seen in cinema or likely to see in cinema today. Also Edwards is not afraid to slow down the action and keep us entertained in slow paced comedic sequences that are as slow as the speed of a caterpillar and where the music accompanying them sounds like an elephants lullaby; yet it is hugely entertaining and gives us great punch-lines!

When I put all those elements together I can only come to one conclusion that this is an outstanding film experience that compares with very few; especially in the realm of comedy!",1466467200,,1618,4.73404255319149

120248,2,079074676X,"Great movie poor release, once again Warner seems to forget that the bluray was a format meant to have lots of languages, at least subtitles in more than one language.
As usual with almost every release of the Warner Archive Collection, this release lacks of any languages besides English, either Audio or Subtitles, you will only find English.
Once again we'll have to wait for a release on another country/region to have subtitles, or a custom version where they include audios from DVD and subtitles from DVD.
If only all the companies that release blurays these days remembered the promise they made when the format was beggining, about having more languages, more audio tracks and subtitles because the capacity of the bluray was more than the dvd......
Besides that, a long expected movie finally released on bluray, but in my humble opinion it deserved more than just an Archive Collection release being one of the most wanted musicals to be released on bluray, they could have gone with an anniversary edition, some movies get 15th, then 17th, then 30th, etc, this is one movie that sure deserves not only an anniversary release (they missed the 30th birthday already they could perfectly release a 35th anniversary release by the end of this year......) with an interview with Julie Andrews and what this movie meant for her, and an homage or remembering the actors who are not with us anymore, Robert Preston, Alex Karras, James Garner and so more....",1463616000,4,1461,4.919028340080971

Julie Andrews sparkles as the great Victoria, belting out fabulous songs to Henry Mancini's musical score, such as ""Le Jazz Hot"", one of the best numbers in the film. James Gardner is the Chicago mobster who falls for Victoria, or for Victor?Leslie Ann Warren, is superb as Gardner's Moll was nominated for Best supporting Actress Oscar for her roll that year. Let's not forget legendary Robert Preston, Victoria's best friend and sidekick in this hilarious story of gender identity in Paris during the 1930's.

120337,5,079074676X,"Thank you ladies and gentlemen, you are most kind.....in fact, you're every kind.
What other movie musical gives as much prominence to a supporting character (the cockroach) as Victor/Victoria.  The humor is sly and uproarious; the music sublime, the acting is top rate (especially the great chemistry between Julie Andrews and Robert Preston).
The idea for salvaging the sagging careers of Toddy (Preston) and Victoria Grant (Andrews) is brilliant.  Become a female impersonator.......who could do that better than a woman!  And they mostly get away with that but for a pesky P.I. and the suspicious King Marchand (James Garner), who is determined to prove hes a she.  Although, there might have been easier ways to prove this than breaking and entering plus a little voyeurism.
My favorite scene will always be the incomparable Robert Preston singing The Shady Dame from Seville, as Victoria (even wearing the same gown!  It was designed to fit Preston.  They used eyehooks to draw it in to fit Andrews.  Waste not want not!).",1454889600,,1028,5.083333333333333
120338,4,079074676X,"Pacing is a little slow compared to modern movies, which may be a negative to younger viewers. The comedic moments are great and I found it refreshing to watch a movie that didn't rely heavily on ""gross out"" tactics to get a laugh. I love Julie Andrew's voice so that was a big part of my enjoyment factor. It was also nice to see Robert Preston in something quite different from the Music Man - my only other exposure to him as an actor. What really helped this movie feel less dated was their handling of the (numerous) gay characters, it felt more modern than the 1980s era attitudes it was created in. My teenage son was a bit put off by the over-the-top campy dance number with Leslie Ann Warren, but that would probably appeal to the ""gross comedy"" crowd since it crossed from cute to uncomfortable for me. Maybe it was the kiddie porn vibe that rubbed me wrong. Overall it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed it more than many comedies from recent years.",1454803200,2,956,4.346368715083799

120359,5,079074676X,"This is one of my all time favorite films.  First of all, there are stellar performances from Julie Andrews, James Garner, Alex Karras, Leslie Ann Warren, and Robert Preston, with a plethora of memorable turns from the supporting cast.  Set in 1934 Paris, Victor/Victoria is the tale of an out of work light-opera soprano who finally achieves fame and fortune as a female impersonator in a cabaret theater, or as she says as ""a woman, pretending to be a man, pretending to be a woman.""  There is wonderful singing from Andrews, sidesplitting comedy juxtaposed with moments of heartfelt pathos, and an unforgettable final scene parody of one of Andrews' numbers by Preston in drag. Yet for all its gaiety and its immensely satisfying musical score, Blake Edwards' satire uses the plight of women under patriarchy to expose the tenuousness of heteronormative masculinity and its failure to hold up under close scrutiny, exposing the performance aspect of masculinity effectively enough to make Judith Butler proud.",1448236800,,1012,5.158536585365853

Perhaps once I have the wherewithal to upgrade my tech equipment, I'll love this disc.  Buyers beware though, if you still have a writable player, this disc may not work for you.

He plays the part to the hilt without tipping over into parody.  I'm not good at writing reviews so I won't try to be entertaining...the movie does it so much better than I ever could.  The music, by Henry Mancini, and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, is a cast member all by itself.  From ""Gay Paree"" to ""Le Jazz Hot"" to ""Crazy World,"" the music moves the plot along and reveals the characters's personalities, weaknesses, and strengths.

120596,4,079074676X,Victor/Victoria has a marvelous performance with Julie Andrews; it's a treat to see her sing so many kinds of music so well BUT Robert Preston is outstanding!  His drag queen is marvelous.  So is Lesley Ann Warren - who knew 'Cinderella' could play someone so ignorant so hilariously.  Alex Karras does a lovely turn as a former football player with a sensitive side.  James Garner is entertaining as a fish very much out of his normal water.  Kudos too to the screen writing team.  My only complaint is that it's slightly too long . . Heads up for people who hate gays - this is NOT the movie for you.,1425686400,3,602,4.427272727272728

Julie Andrews gets about as far from Mary Poppins and Maria Von Trapp as one can and pulls off a woman-pretending-to-be-a-man-pretending-to-be-a-woman as no one else could. James Garner is terrific as King Marchand, and Lesley Ann Warren as Trixie is a hoot. Great soundtrack by Henry Mancini with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse.

Julie Andrews as always, pitch perfect, great choreography, costumes and sets.  Preston and Andrews, both broke and hungry in Paris, team up to make Andrews a nightclub sensation to make people think she is a girl while performing, but at the end of the show, takes off her wig to show she is a guy. James Garner, looking gorgeous, plays a gentle bad guy and is doubting Andres is a man.  It goes from there.  Acting from major roles to minor is excellent.",1421366400,,574,4.524271844660194

120698,5,079074676X,"I've seen this movie several times and love it more each time. I think the most remarkable thing about Victor/Victoria is the chemistry between Julie Andrews and Robert Preston. There is genuine affection between the actors which seems to give the movie a special glow. I find myself feeling a bit jealous of Toddy and Victoria's almost immediate affinity for each other. And Leslie Ann Warren's Norma is one of my favorite movie characters EVER.  The scene outside the dressing room where Norma finds out about Toddy's sexual preference is one I play almost ad nauseam. James Garner inhabits his role with his usual deft manner which means he, too, is an excellent ingredient to this champagne cocktail of a  movie. Even the short minor roles have been cast with care.  The dead pan receptionist steals the scene she is in. This is one of my top ten favorite movies. I give it my highest recommendation.",1417392000,,904,4.782051282051282

I pop the movie in and enjoy the fun. Leslie Ann Warren's dance routine is bawdy for her
character, however, it surprised everyone when this classic was purchased just to see her
dance. I do believe she was nominated for an Oscar as a Supporting Actress. This is
Julie Andrew at her best. Grab the popcorn, bottle of Coke, box of Goobers and a hankerchief

Leslie Ann Warren as the brash and brassy Chicago show girl / gangster's moll gives us a performance we never knew she had in her.  And, of course, James Garner, shows us the softer side of being a macho gangster.  I won't speak about the plot or story line except to say that the story telling is classic Blake Edwards at his best.  Many great laughs along the way.

The star of this show is Robert Preston, who I've been lucky enough to see on stage a few times. Julie Andrews and James Garner are good and Leslie Ann Warren is dynamic and hilarious; nevertheless, Preston as Toddy is the glue that holds the show together and by far the most sympathetic character of the film.

I nearly forgot - the music by Henry Mancini and songs by Mancini and Leslie Bricusse. Unforgettable. Personally, I think replacing ""Crazy World"" for the Broadway version was the kisd of death. A perfect song of imperfect love.",1399420800,3,755,4.5851851851851855

Lesley Ann Warren is amazing in her character as is James Garner.

If you are offended by the homosexual message, then this is probably not one you are going to enjoy, but if you want to watch Julie sing and act, James Garner performs as only Mr. Garner can, a brilliant job by the underused Leslie Ann Warren (Pure Country) Alex Karras, Robert Preston, et al, this is a fun movie.

120960,5,079074676X,"My five star rating means five stars within this genre of romantic comedy.
The historic environment of Paris is charming. The development of the story is very fine, and the complication in the background, where the private detective tries to reveal the fraud is just exactly not to much. It doesn't make us loose focus from the main track but adds a little more exitement.
The film approaches the question of homosexuality without going too far, which is important to many. We catch glimpses of the half naked dancegirls but again without making anyone embarrassed. These topics are brillantly handled by the director.
The casting is perfect. Indeed Julie Andrews has always been one of my favorites, since I at the age of ten fell in love with Mary Poppins.
The  only thing about the film that threatens to remove a star is the fact that until Julie changed to male gender, her feminine contribution went a little over the top. Clearly her part reminded us of ""La Boheme."" That in itself is OK, but we simply can't recognize the intelligent person she is to become later when she acts as Victor. Not to mention the blonde Norma Cassidy who is acting very charmingly, but absolutely can't be respected as a woman.
It is a little like the film ""Brokeback Mountain."" In this movie the heterosexual girls at the rodeomarket (?) are elaborate bimbos and not real women.
This phenomenon - the humiliation of the female gender - is perhaps the gay worlds revenge for  their own sufferings in this world of heterosexuality. But even though I can laugh of it - in my own world the females holds much higher esteem.
But all in all: A wonderfull film.",1388793600,,1641,4.674740484429066

But Julie, my goodness Julie, is a riot because she's this proper English woman who whips her finger through a stain on a mans shirt out of hunger! It's adorable while I'm sure the intent was sad.  I love this movie for going whole heartly into the world of chaotic sillyness.  It is in no way a real world scenario kind of movie, things in this movie unfold in a way they only can on film. I adore every minute of it although it does drag on past two hours, which isn't really necessary. Its over 2 hours because its a musical and when you have Julie Andrews, you make her sing as much as you can. It's one of those movies you are not meant to take seriously, but simply to enjoy as the fun movie is was meant to be.

121061,5,079074676X,"In my family I am known as ""the movie queen"". I LOVE movies and have seen many of them. Victor/Victoria is one of those movies that I watch quite often. One of the things I like about it is that it is a musical and Julie Andrews does such a great job with all of her songs that after I watch the movie, I find myself going through my day humming them. She is glorious in this movie. There's a song that Victoria (Julie Andrews) and Toddy sing as a duet while they are in a club that is one of my favorite songs ever!.  I also find all of the ""complications"" in the movie quite hilarious.
  Julie Andrews (aka Victoria Grant) (aka Victor)---see what I mean about ""the complications""!?#$--is living in Paris, France in 1934 and is virtually penniless-no money, no job, a horrible room in a boarding house, a nasty, ill-tempered landlord-and is starving to death. But, she has one thing going for her---her voice--it is incredible. But, she can't get hired to sing in a club despite the many auditions she goes to. Because she is starving--and out of desperation, she puts a cockroach in her purse and goes to a ""La-De-Da"" French restaurant in hopes of setting the creature free in her salad to get out of paying. In that restaurant, she meets Toddy who helps her let the cockroach loose--chaos ensues. They escape from the restaurant-not having to pay, but not before Julie's character has eaten 2 complete meals--PLUS 2 desserts! Then those ""complications"" start! Toddy helps Victoria become a female impersonator. However, she has to dress like a man and become Victor to get a job.
  Next, you add in a mobster, a jealous girlfriend, many fantastic songs that are very well done, and some other ""complications"" and you have the recipe for an enjoyable time watching this movie. There's nothing that I don't like about this movie! The tunes stay with you. The actors do a fabulous job. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a story where love triumphs in the end. I'll always vote ""yes"" for a movie that is uplifting and gets me singing!",1371686400,4,2048,4.584699453551913

121085,5,079074676X,"The film opens on a fake-looking Paris of 1932, a set practically torn out of the Universal Studios production lot (see also Who Framed Roger Rabbit). The film is full of flirty man-love dialogue, and a struggling-actress Julie Andrews' wicked audition with breaking glass, ""What in the hall was that?"" ""D-flat."" (yes, it becomes a terrible cliche). Lots of great off-camera comedy happening - hey, it's a Blake Edwards film!!! Man-loving Pa-ree song by a male man-lover (""they say that Pa-ree has always been that way""; self-consciously funny). Cockroach-waiter-restaurant-maitre d story (""Mademoiselle, I offer my sincerer apologies."") Amazingly - this is a Blake Edwards film - the cockroach waiter turns up later on... great ""is she... that girl I saw earlier... nah"" internal conversation expressed on the face. Ha ha! Julie Andrews beats up a nancy man (we're watching this one night after we saw her in The Sound Of Music), and sets up a plausible diversion. Awesome champagne balancing act set-up by a magician, possibly set up by Victoria and her partner Toddy. Non-straight onlookers at practice, watching a women pretending to be a man-loving Polish count pretending to be a woman. During musical numbers we see Julie's low neckline, but everyone else is fooled when she pulls off her headgear to reveal... a short haircut! She's a HE!! ""Sit up, stand up, throw up."" Great musical numbers, great Robert Plant-like siren rise.

""I just love French men.""
""Me too.""

""I think the right woman could reform you.""
""I think the right woman could reform you!""

""You must have been in the army.""
""Oh, once or twice.""

""Oh give me a home, where the buffalo roam, where the deer and the antelope are gaa-ay.""

""You know, being a man has its disadvantages.""
'My dear count, you just said a cotton-pickin' mouthful.""

Spanish number again with shattered glass. Lesley Ann Warren awesome as the dopey, fleshy, bust-y gangster moll Norma Callaghan, who is kicked out of her impotent (uninterested) boyfriend's suite, scorned, flashing her lingerie as the train pulls out of the station in Paris, in a new cabaret in Paris tattling on her ex's wavering love preference to gawking slack-jawed cigar-clenching local gangsters. ""Run that by me again.""

Great fight - nice touch as Toddy tries to bribe a cop, then punches him and keeps the money. Wonderful unveiling romance.

""I don't care if you're a man.""
""I'm not a man.""
""I still don't care.""

The burly bodyguard has an opportunity to come out to his boss, and more insanity ensues. Crackling dialogue abounds, especially from Julie ""I'm my own man, so-to-speak"" Andrews and tough guy James ""If you think I""m worried that people think I'm a fruit, then you're right"" Garner. And Blake Edwards, being Blake Edwards, can't resist throwing in a bumbling inspector, played by Geoffrey Beevers, who has two great scenes, one of them after he sits down on a stool after a bar brawl:

""Be careful.""
""I am always careful.""
""That stool is broken.""
""It is?!?!""
BAM!!

Great scene as Andrews and Garner go to the fights (he's into it), and then to the opera (her world). Ha ha. Non-straight dancing, with masks. ""You two-timing son-of-a-dog - he's a woman!!!""

Incidentally, the film is a remake of the film Viktor Und Viktoria, a German film from 1933, and later in French as Georges et Georgette (also in 1933). These were followed by the first English remake, ""First a Girl"" in 1935. Ahhhhh... the 1930s, they had their moments as well...",1371254400,2,3478,4.926495726495727

Robert Preston is not just an actor...he has charisma to burn.  Julie Andrews voice has never been better.  James Garner proves that he can play broad comedy with the best of them.  Leslie Ann Warren plays an annoying, scheming twit to perfection.  The rest of the cast is excellent.

I think I'll go watch it again.",1367625600,2,468,4.5

The movie itself is very enjoyable, and worth it for anyone in my opinion, even those who would panic at the subject material, as this really did happen in Paris.

Imagine my disappointment when a friend and I sat down to watch a poor-quality tape (although it arrived as a new, factory-sealed tape!! It had several ""blackouts"" and background noise in the early part of the story, but then straightened out so the rest of the plot could be watched. A terrific praise for owning a fantastic, award-winning story by Blake Edwards, I feel that as an international customer (Canadian) , protected by a
mixup in low quality being passed off as top quality(NEW),this tape should have been watched then rewrapped before sending. We do not live in a perfect world

On Broadway we see Julie Andrews, already sixty, perform as if she were a much younger person. The music in that production is different from that of the movie, but I like it better because it gives more variety. She sings some of the same songs, but her voice had matured, and her range was different. I do prefer the movie, except for the music. I really can't more to compare the two because they are different even with similar story lines. I am glad I have both to enjoy. Julie did a wonderful job in both!!!",1362960000,,620,4.4

And truly ahead of it's time in the way they portray ""homosex-su-als"" (as Julie Andrews pronounces the word - cracks me up every time!), being the very regular, normal people they are!

Wonderful acting, singing, costumes, humor. Just wonderful!",1357862400,,525,4.46875

Julie Andrews pulls off the task of playing a woman playing a man playing a woman without a hitch! Her vocals are absolutely stunning here, this movie showcases her talents in voice and acting. There is not a sour note from her supporting cast either- James Garner is the tough guy who turns out that he has a softer side, Leslie Ann Warren is wonderful as his girlfriend- and she has something to say when she realizes that James is falling for Victor Victoria. I especially love this movie because, as a musical, the people sing when 'normal' folk would sing, on a stage!

121294,5,079074676X,"I like to collect unique movies and this is one of the funniest musicals every made! Ten years after this film, Julie Andrews ruined her singing voice in a Broadway revival based on this movie!) She was a prodigy and had a phenomenal musical-range even as a child!) Warning: contains spoilers: Based on an obscure 1930's German-language film, this was rated ""R"" at one time. Compared to today's explicit movies, it seems quite mild. Cross-dressing? Homosexuality? Only slightly worse that Some Like It Hot or Tootsie. As a musical, sadly, it does not have enough songs. But it is a Blake Edwards movie and has a lot of ""Pink Panther"" humor in it including some recognizable actors from those films. Some of the best scenes are not musical: the cockroach-in-the-food and the 2 riots at ""the club."" Lesley Ann Warren steals the show as the stereotypical platinum blonde and her ""Chi-Town"" dance routine is incredibly steamy.  Alex Karas gives the best performance of his career. Robert Preston has entirely too much fun as the incredibly gay homosexual. You can tell that the cast had a blast making this film. The only drawback: like many Blake Edwards (and Stanley Kubrick) films, some scenes tend to drag on and it seems a bit long at times. Great fun for adults (but not for the whole family).",1317945600,,1295,4.78125

121299,5,079074676X,VICTOR/VICTORIA remains a high acheivement of early 1980s film-making. And time does not seem to diminish it. I watch it every couple of years or so - and at each viewing the story is strong and the funny is funny. It makes me miss Robert Preston - but THE MUSIC MAN does that to me too. Blake Edwards delivers a couple of the best sequences ever put on film - the restaurant scene early on with Julie Andrews and Robert Preston with the best dead-pan waiter ever (Graham Stark) makes me laugh even when I think about it away from the film - and the lengthy slamming-door-farce (minus the slamming doors) sequence in the hotel is great fun every time.

121300,4,079074676X,"Director/screenwriter Blake Edwards (1922-2010) was a more versatile talent than he is generally given credit for.  He first received great acclaim for directing ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" (1961) starring Audrey Hepburn. Next, he directed the stark alcoholism drama ""Days Of Wine And Roses"" (1962) starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick. But Edwards will be best remembered for his comedies. The early, original ""Pink Panther"" films starring Peter Sellers and the wacky, physical comedy of ""The Great Race""  (1965)  immediately come to mind. But ""Victor/Victoria"" (1982) may well be the comedy apex of Edwards' career. Nearly thirty years later, ""Victor/Victoria"" still shines as a classy, gender-bending gem; an extremely warm, wise, and witty film.
  Unemployed, starving singer Victoria (Edwards' real life wife Julie Andrews) is pursuaded by her flamboyant pal Toddy (the superb Robert Preston) to masquarade as ""a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman."" The risky gamble pays off.  Victor/Victoria opens his/her act at a swanky gay/bisexual nightclub run by Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davis) and quickly becomes the toast of 1930's Paris.  The increasingly complicated androgynous antics confuse macho gangster King Marchan (James Garner). who finds himself attracted to him/her, and frustrate his floozy girlfriend Norma (Lesley Ann Warren). King's bodyguard Squash (Alex Karras) is also hiding his own little secret.
  Julie  Andrews tells an insecure James Garner, ""Your problem, Mr. Marchan, is that you're preoccupied with stereotypes."" Throughout the  film, Edwards constantly plays with the audiences' expectatations, perceptions, and stereotypical assumptions.  On the face of it, who would believe that lovely, lady-like Julie Andrews could convincingly portray a man in drag? Yet, she pulls off her dual roles with aplomb, and she looks smashing in a tuxedo. Likewise, who would have thought that Robert Preston, who practically steals the movie, would make such an endearing, gay cabaret artist? Interestingly, James Garner, feeling that Toddy was a better, more interesting, role reportedly begged Edwards to let him portray Toddy instead of King. Edwards refused the request.
  The film is full of Edwards' trademark touches. But, underneath all the physical humor and mistaken identities, there is a definite message and method within Edwards' comic genius. The film really is an effective game of topsy-turvy. ""Victor/Victoria"" takes place in a homosexual environment. By comic curcumstance, Victoria and King are forced to ""play gay"" in public. Privately, they wish to ""come out of the closet"" and proclaim they are, and their love is, heterosexual. Edwards subtly  points out that  in this crazy world, we are all united, regardless of sexual orientation, by our common humanity.
  Edwards received an Academy Award nomination  for his Screenplay, and Andrews, Preston, and Warren also received nominations for their inspired comedy performances. Henry Mancini and Leslie Bricusse did win an Academy Award for their musical score, which includes the memorable showstopper ""Le Jazz Hot."" Edwards later adapted his Screenplay into the book for a 1995 stage musical adaptation. Julie Andrews made a welcome and triumphant return to Broadway in the title roles. Robert Preston passed away in 1985. Toddy was portrayed on stage by Tony Roberts, with Michael Nouri and Rachel York as King and Norma. Theatre critics were cold towards Edwards' book (which was extremely faithful to his original screenplay) and the show itself, but loved Julie Andrews. When she was the only member of the cast to receive a Tony nomination, Andrews made a very public, but very classy, speech declining the nomination. Sadly, two years later, a botched throat operation ended Andrews' long and distingushed musical career.",1300233600,2,3829,5.503412969283277

121316,2,079074676X,"This was a very popular movie, but it really doesn't work on a number of levels. The major flaw, is that Jule Andrews just doesn't convince as playing a man, the whole crux of the story.  It's not her fault, she's simply not the kind of actress who was able to transform herself enough, to take on the mannerisms, looks, movements, facial expressions, etc of a male (even a 1930's sophisticated ""gay"" one), although I'm sure she gave it her all.  Without at least a degree of suspension of belief (as Dustin Hoffman, a very different breed of actor, succeeded in conveying in another crossdressing romantic comedy from the same year, TOOTSIE), the movie's mechanics and set pieces fall flat.  The fault lies here with director Blake Edwards, who by this point had taken to casting Andrews in all of his movies (S.O.B. is a better, though certainly less popular example of their collaboration).  Granted, the role would have been a tough casting choice in any era; to get a good singer, but one with honed enough physical acting skills to pull off the role; five years or so later Glenn Close (by which point she had become a star) would have been a far better choice, and today of course, CGI would probably be used to resculpt Andrews as ""Victor"".  So if we don't believe Andrews as Victor in the first place, the musical set numbers in which we see ""him"" as a female impersonator really just become laborious...we're just watching Julie in some mediocre (at best) musical scenes, in close up yet; no female impersonator is that good, the concept of the impersonator is of course illusion, and Edwards and Andrews don't pull off the illusion that we the real audience is watching the screen audience believe they're watching a female singer, who then turns out to be man pretending to be a woman).  The first time I saw Boy George, I thought he was a female, having had the presence and mannerisms of a female, his illusion worked, at least the first time, even if he wasn't actually doing a female impersonation act.  In SOME LIKE IT HOT, a film smartly shot in black and white, Lemmon and Curtis never convince they're females (I don't think they're trying), but the comedy is broad enough, and the filmmakers create such a sense of good will and humor with the audience, that we just accept the scenario and go along for the ride.  As Victor, Andrews simply looks like a woman with short hair, a man's suit, and is lowering her voice a little.

SOME LIKE IT HOT brings up two other major flaws in VICTOR/VICTORIA.  Everything I tried to make a case for above could be thrown out a window if only the movie is very funny, and it's not.  It's cute, it's not a bad way to spend two hours on a rainy day, but except for a few chuckles, it's just not funny.  Blake Edwards tries, and you can certainly see his wheels spinning, but again, most of the jokes fall flat.  Edwards tries to catch lightning in a bottle again in a running gag with a tired replay of an Inspector Clouseau type private eye; and another running gag with a waiter (Graham Stark, from Edwards' Pink Panther franchise) leads nowhere.  The film finally lacks a great payoff, in fact, loses steam about two thirds of the way through, with no conflict or tension set up.  It could be that after Edwards elaborately built his premise, he finally had no where to go with it (I haven't seen the early 1930's German film on which this one is based), suprising for a writer/director of his quality (and the opposite of Some Like It Hot, which has a perfect structure, conflict and resolution).

The supporting cast of Alex Karras and Lesly Ann Warren perform their tasks admirably, John Rhys-Davies is given nothing to do. James Garner is James Garner, and Robert Preston kind of steals the show, but it's really not a great, bravura character performance either (and his character  becomes nearly invisible for a long stretch, until his drag number at the coda, which also doesn't work very well, either as a set piece, or in terms of storyline).

The movie was successful enough to have spawned a Broadway musical production a dozen years later, starring in turn Andrews, Liza Minnelli and Raquel Welch.  But though Victor/Victoria is fondly remembered, it's not very good.",1248134400,7,4237,4.632843791722296

With the exception of Preston's room and dialog at the beginning of the movie, which originally raised my hopes, the sets looked fake.  The acting seemed fake as either over the top or flying under the radar.  The dialog was highly contrived and strained.  The plot's chain of events seemed forced.  Try as I might, including closing my eyes just to listen only, Andrews never convinced me that anyone would confuse her for a man.  And that is a big problem when the plot of the movie hinges on it.  The other actors in the film all wondered how Garner figured out that Victor was actually a Victoria.  I wondered how anyone could conclude otherwise.

I agree with reviewer J.C. Clarke about Preston's final scene.  I felt embarrassed for him.  I know it's a comedy, but ... give me something to laugh at, not something tiresome and clunky.

121333,4,079074676X,"I can't help but think about ""Cabaret"" whenever I watch this film and despite the similarities with the plot with both being a tale about the seedy side of public entertainment just before the 2nd World War in major European cities, I found myself enjoying both films immensely but for different reasons.  I thought the music in ""Cabaret"" was a whole lot stronger and more memorable and enduring although Henry Mancini's work in ""Victor/Victoria"" is still good but I found I appreciated the storyline and virtually everything else film-wise about ""Victor/Victoria"" more than I did for ""Cabaret"".

""Victor/Victoria"" is that very rare comedy that ages very, very well and despite not being a critical favourite at the time of its release clearly has become a classic having stuck around all this time to still remain highly entertaining and amusing.  Few films make me want to watch them over and over again and this film ranks among them for me which rewards repeated viewing.  I thought the casting was inspired as the actors gave very good performances throughout and the theme of hypocrisy and being judgemental of others without looking at yourself first is still relevant today as it was back then and probably since the beginning of civilisation.

Blake Edwards is known for a number of films and especially for his Pink Panther ""comedies"" with Peter Sellers and he seems to want to remind us of that with the inclusion of a similarly bungling French detective here in a minor, forgettable part which for me detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.  Ironically, the Pink Panther ""comedies"" don't age well at all for me which is not surprising as comedies in general are made for the audiences of that time and there are only so many times you can hear a joke before it becomes cliched and just contempt-inducing which is why ""Victor/Victoria"" is so good in that it is still able to retain much of its humour and entertainment value like all classic films should.

This dvd version is also very good as having been given the remastered sound treatment in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround I have to say that the sound quality is really very good.  Although the picture quality hasn't been restored in the same way, I thought that except for the odd frame or two which had white spots overall the picture quality is very good which ironically shows just how ""popular"" it was over the years that the master has not been subjected to overuse and hence accelerated deterioration but as another reviewer pointed out the critics can be wrong and if any of them had some moral fibre they would revisit this film and acknowledge that it's not as bad as they had originally thought.  There are no Special Features worth talking about here such as making of documentaries or cast interviews although the commentary by Blake Edwards and Julie Andrews accompanying the film is pretty good.  The packaging could have been improved as the centre plastic holder actually broke in my copy causing the disc now to hang precariously in the box and I'm hoping the other spokes don't break off too.

Overall this is a very entertaining comedy/musical that ages very well and the dvd quality picture and sound wise is very good making me wonder just how good a properly remastered and restored Blu-ray version would look like.  Still this standared dvd version is pretty good already if you are not willing to wait for another improved version to surface.

This is a very funny film with great songs and comedic performances throughout. Andrews is as enchanting as ever with some really funny performances from Warren,Garner and Preston.

Considering this film was released the same year 'Tootsie' was and with similar premises, no two films could be more different! I personally like 'Tootsie better, but it's a matter of opinion and taste. It was hard for me to believe the beautiful Andrews as a man, but at many times I forgot that Hoffman (Tootsie) wasn't a woman!

121335,5,079074676X,"For anyone who thinks that Julie Andrews is nothing more than a mere song and dance routine, or the voice behind that infectiously annoying `hills are alive' song I have only one thing to say to you; watch `Victor/Victoria'.  I happened to stumble onto this film last night and I have thought of nothing else since.  Sure, it has yet to be 24 hours but honestly, it is the ONLY thing that I have thought of since the credits began to roll.  As a whole the film is adorable, but its strongest part is none other than Julie Andrews.  Her astonishing performance is quite probably her finest moment (although I am very partial to `Marry Poppins') and she chews up each and every scene with her charm and grace.

Victoria Grant is a down-on-her-luck soprano singer willing to `sell her virtue for a meatball' when she runs into the flamboyant Carroll Todd.  After becoming quick friends Todd (also down-on-his-luck) suggests that Victoria disguise herself as a man impersonating a woman in order to make some extra money.  So that she does, donning the persona of the Count Victor Grezhinski, and she quickly becomes a sensation.

Then walks in King Marchand.

Marchand is a gangster who happens to fall for the spell of Victoria only to become baffled when he is informed that she is a he.  Convinced that his initial instincts are not wrong (and that he could in no way be attracted to a man) Marchand makes it a point to uncover Victor's true identity.  Marchand's whiney girlfriend Norma feels betrayed, yet his trusty sidekick Bernstein is somewhat empowered by his friends choices.

The question remains; will Victoria be able to keep her secret?

Like I said, the film as a whole is delightful.  The script is tight and the plot points are never muddled by excess or dragged out by lack of interest; everything seems to flow wonderfully together.  The direction is spotless and engaging and the song and dance numbers are nothing short of stellar (this is the impeccable singing talent known as Julie Andrews mind you).  The performances are also all incredibly credible.  Julie Andrews is undoubtedly the star here, sinking into her character with real gusto and charm.  Robert Preston is also phenomenal as Toddy, giving his flamboyant character enough natural sparkle to make him a standout character.  Lesley Ann Warren captures the whiney ex-girlfriend brilliantly, scratching her annoying voice down the chalkboard of our minds with precise authenticity, and Alex Karras is warm and touching (surprisingly) as Bernstein.  James Garner is a great actor, but he seems like the odd man out here.  He does a good job but he is easily overshadowed by the rest of the cast.

The film, much like `Tootsie' (which was released the same year) broaches on the relationships between men and woman and the whole `equal rights' aspect of things.  Once King and Victoria progress into their relationship it becomes apparent that the mans feelings are given greater concern, at least in his mind, and this leads to a nice little sub-thought on the weight given to the battle of the sexes.  It is never fleshed out to an extreme because it is not the true focus of the film, but it is there for those who are interested in finding it.

`Victor/Victoria' is a wonderfully entertaining film that nails each and every gag, soaring to the skies with its infectious combination of comedy, drama and romance.  This is a near perfect movie that touches every one of our senses and plants itself in our memories and in our hearts.  You can place this on the shelf next to `Cabaret' as one of the best musicals of all time.",1225843200,,3607,4.766505636070853
121336,5,079074676X,"Other comedies might be funnier, but few compare to the nearly perfect total ensemble performance turned in by the principals, supporting and bit characters in Blake Edwards's Victor Victoria.

Julie Andrews plays Victoria, a down and out singer in gay Paris, circa 1934, who, with Toddy, dreams up a nightclub act in which Andrews feigns a male in drag to become the toast of Paris. Robert Preston's portrayal of the flamboyant gay veteran of the stage, Toddy, is perfect, sometimes cliche, but never over the top. James Garner plays King Marchand, a Chicago nightclub owner, who is taken by Victoria -- until she reveals she is a man -- but he isn't totally taken in by the ruse and so sets out to prove, as much for his own male ego as for the romantic spark he feels for Victoria, that the ""he"" Victor portrays is really a ""she."" Garner's expressions throughout the film are hilarious -- first when Victoria reveals, onstage, that she is Victor, a male drag queen, later as he watches, concealed in a closet, as Victoria strips for a bath and he realizes he was right all along, and later when his bodyguard, Squash (played Alex Karras), comes out of the closet.

It's clear that the three principals, Andrews, Preston and Garner, had the time of their lives in this movie. Garner and Andrews's shared scenes are all noteworthy, particularly their bedroom scene as they discuss the sexual identity confusions that are sure to result from his being seen in public with a male drag queen.

Andrews, Preston and Lesley Ann Warren, as Garner's annoying moll, were all nominated for Oscars, as was Henry Mancini's musical score.

Musical highlights include ""Le Jazz Hot"" (which tests even Andrews's vocal range); ""Gay Paree"" (Preston); ""You and Me"" (an Andrews/Preston duet that is sheer brilliance in its improvised presentation); and my favorite, the haunting ""Crazy World,"" the lyrics made poignant by Andrews's vocal-cord surgery in 1997.

Everything conspires to make this one of the best musical comedies ever filmed -- the cast, the score, the script (clearly a Blake Edwards creation, with a touch of Pink Panther slapstick subtly interspersed here and there), the costumes, the period automobiles, even the set (it's interesting to note that the entire movie was shot in a studio -- even the street sequences of 1934 Paris).

Highly enjoyable and listenable, a delightful view.",1212883200,2,2385,4.95

121338,5,079074676X,"Mostly it's because the characters are so very likable. Absolutely, VICTOR/VICTORIA triumphs on the strength of its witty script, the clever humor, and the fabulous songs. The film can tout itself as a dizzying sex farce, a winning period piece comedy, or as a dazzling musical. But all that would've been irrelevant piffle if the actors hadn't come thru with truly wonderful performances, making the audience and the critics root for them. So, in the end, the glue to it, is because the characters are so very likable. The premise (still controversial in 1982) can give pause to some folks, it's not exactly a rated PG topic. But there's warmth and an appeal in VICTOR/VICTORIA which makes it accessible even to the uptight brigade. Curious about how Maria and Mary Poppins became Count Victor Grezhinski? Well, so was I.

Life is very trying in Paris, 1934, for struggling soprano Victoria Grant (Andrews). She can't make a living as a singer, her rent is two weeks overdue, and she's woozy from hunger. On the verge of swapping her virtue for a meatball, Victoria's luck changes when she runs into gay cafe performer Carroll Todd, or ""Toddy"" (Preston), in a restaurant, and they instantly hit it off. A downpour, a cold, shrinking wardrobe, and Victoria trouncing Toddy's old flame all conspire to give Toddy a screwy idea. And so, six weeks later, Victoria makes her nightclub debut as Count Victor Grezhinski, an exiled aristocrat and a gay Polish female impersonator. Count Grezhinski is an instant sensation, with fame, money, and fancy digs soon to follow. And then love just had to come in and muck up the works. James Garner plays King Marchand, a rugged American nightclub owner who becomes alarmed at his attraction towards ""Victor."" But then King has his suspicions...

So, to me, this was a new and revelatory Julie Andrews. It never really struck me how narrowly I've pigeonholed Julie Andrews, until Count Grezhinski came on stage and messed around with my senses. In this cross-dressing, gender-bending romantic musical comedy, Andrews is ""practically perfect in every way,"" and so very distant from her chaste Maria and Mary Poppins. Her Victoria is down-to-earth and frank and experienced. A real grown-up.

If Julie Andrews is brilliant, then Robert Preston is sublime! As the big-hearted and openly gay (but not over-the-top) Toddy, he may have surpassed his Professor Hill in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Music-Man-Special-Edition/dp/B00000F14B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Music Man (Special Edition)</a>. It's very close. He's a hell of an actor, and I felt like giving him his own paragraph.

James Garner probably has the most challenging role to play, as his character serves as the audience's substitute. He pulls it off with his wonderfully restrained performance. In the audio commentary, Julie Andrews and her hubby/director Blake Edwards give massive credit to Garner, whose understated reactions helped to lend the film its credibility with the audience. When King Marchand seems to buy into the charade, then the audience buys into it, as well. Garner and Andrews, by the way, bring the same easy chemistry they had in 1964's excellent and cynical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Americanization-of-Emily/dp/B0007TKNGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Americanization of Emily</a>. And even though I'm not too enamoured of King Marchand's shrill, uncouth girlfriend (I don't think we were supposed to be), Lesley Anne Warren plays her well.

VICTOR/VICTORIA came out in 1982, way past the heyday of the Hollywood musical. Part of what makes this film works is that the songs are introduced within the real life structure of the story. Given the nature of the premise, the songs are integral pieces of the plot. That they are so memorable are thanks largely to the interpretation of Julie Andrews and Robert Preston. Andrews shines - I mean absolutely shines! - with ""Le Jazz Hot,"" ""The Shady Dame from Seville,"" and ""Crazy World."" Andrews and Preston do a duet in the charming ""You and Me."" But the showstopper of showstoppers is introduced at the end of the film, as Preston does his own wacky version of ""The Shady Dame from Seville."" Preston's rendition was shot in one take, as Blake Edwards allowed him to cut loose, which he did, and uproariously. And we can't really talk about the music without mentioning Henry Mancini's poignant and evocative score, which gently offsets the flashy, colorful numbers.

A sophisticated bawdiness colors the film. A vaudevillian sensibility creeps in - there's a hilarious scene featuring the world's greatest equilibriust. Low brow slapstick mixes with witty banter. Old-fashioned romance clashes with sexual conflict. But it's all done with generosity and a sweetness and a warm understanding. This is my favorite Blake Edwards film. And I'm glad it had a happy ending; I wouldn't want a girl having to strap herself down for 20 years and having her bosom end up looking like two empty wallets.

First, the down side: Julie Andrews is not at all convincing as a man, much less a gay man, has no business singing jazz, and delivers every line as if she's thinking about the camera angle. (Although I'm not sure any woman would have been utterly believable as a man, there has got to be someone who would have been better than she was.)

But the ridiculous story was quite amusing, Robert Preston was absolutely convincing in his role (as was Alex Karas) the scenes of old Paris lovely, the music enchanting, and Lesley Ann Warren wonderful.

And since it was Andrews's husband who made the movie, it couldn't have been better.  It couldn't have been better because it wouldn't have been made without Julie.

Robert Preston (who I only remember from westerns) is fantastic as the fey Carroll Todd, a struggling singer in pre-war Paris.  Julie Andrews is also incredible...going from an unrecognizable singer to the androgynous ""Victor"" was quite a stretch but she pulled it off.

The story is a good one, an elaborate and wacky deception to pass Andrews off as a gay man while playing a woman (and so on and on)--typical Blake Edwards scene-shifting and hysterical action (the cockroach scene with the wide-angle lens was a howl).

The support characters all were great;  James Garner seemed a bit stiff, but became more himself as time went on, Alex Karras being the gay bodyguard was unexpectedly funny, and Lesley Ann Warren stole scenes with her dumb blonde routine.

121406,5,079074676X,"I'd give it more stars if I could.

This movie is unquestionably (in my mind) Blake Edwards' masterpiece.  I won't belabor the plot and its joys.  Others have told that story.  But what truly sets this movie apart is its use of ""bits"" -- small character parts, bits of business, and other moments that give the movie a more three-dimensional flavor.  Not many movies can pull that off successfully.  We have the waiter that Victoria and Toddy encounter at various times through the film.  Their initial banter with him (when Victoria finishes her first meal -- her first in four days -- very quickly he picks up the tablecloth and remarks, ""I've only been gone 5 minutes.  I thought you must have a dog.""  When she remarks the the beef was a little tough, he responds, ""Maybe the way you're eating, your jaws are getting tired."") sets the tone for subsequent encounters.  The fellow in the hotel who keeps trying to put his shoes outside his door to be shined, but every time he comes out, something weird is going on in the hall, and he disappears again back into his room.  The Inspector Clouseau type detective who is hired by the owner of Chez Luiz to discover what is going on is used just enough to be funny without (as I found with the Clouseau movies) getting tiresome.  When he first comes into Chez Luiz, he is told, ""Be careful.""  He responds, ""I'm always careful.""  And the comeback, ""That stool is broken.""  At which point it collapses.  (It plays better than it sounds.)  Timing is everything, and this movie has it in spades.

Of course, the songs and dances are wonderful.  The ""Shady Lady from Seville"" is delightfully sarcastic the first time we see it, and that feeling echoes later on as well.  The dance number in Chez Luiz with the two-sided constumes is inspired.

121411,5,079074676X,"Blake Edwards had a unique style of film; all the films seemed to have a certain atmosphere while each maintaining an individual character. Of course, Julie Andrews was a frequent actress in his films - Edwards and Andrews are married, and have been since 1969, an astonishing longevity for Hollywood.

In 'Victor/Victoria', Edwards returns to a Parisian settings familiar to fans of his work in the Pink Panther series - there is some minor elements of slapstick (the clutzy waiter, the bumbling detective, perhaps a nod in the direction of the Pink Panther films), but the real narrative plot is drawn along by the stylish comedy of Julie Andrews (Victoria Grant/Victor) and Robert Preston (Carroll Todd), in one of his last films.

The film is actually based on a much older piece, from 1933, written by Reinhold Sch&uuml;nzel, a German actor and writing, known in Europe primarily from the 1920s to the 1950s (perhaps English-speaking audiences would know him best from his role in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Notorius'). This was not the first, nor the last remake of this piece.

Preston plays an aging, gay, musical theatre man-about-town, who we take it is various a performer, talent scout, and director. Through a strange set of circumstances, he happens to be in a restaurant with a down-on-her-luck singer, who has just flopped at her last audition, and was willing to sell her virtue to the hotel manager for a meatball. She has captured a cockroach, and intends to plant the bug in the salad, thus avoiding payment of the bill - Carroll Todd ('Toddy' to his friends) and Victoria escape the restaurant, and come to share a room together while figuring out what to do.

Toddy comes up with the idea of dressing up Victoria as a man to then present her as the greatest drag queen, with the absurd name of Count Victor Grezhinski, a gay Polish count. 'Who would ever believe it?' Victoria protests. 'A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be woman.'

'It's perfect!' Toddy insists.

'Everyone will know he's a phony,' Victoria insists.

'Exactly! Everyone will know HE's a phony.'

Victoria as Victor auditions for Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the greatest talent and booking agent in Paris. He schedules Victor to open in a grand venue, and the deception seems complete. That is, until King Marchand (James Garner), a Chicago gangster and nightclub owner, arrives, complete with bodyguard (Alex Karras) and moll in tow (Leslie Ann Warren). He doesn't believe the act, and is determined to discover the truth.

While Victor/Victoria is not a musical in the sense of 'Cats' or 'Showboat', it does have some really stunning musical numbers, as one would expect from a Julie Andrews production. 'Le Hot Jazz' and 'The Shady Dame from Seville' are excellent numbers (Preston does his own reprise of 'The Shady Dame' for the big finale), and other numbers are fun; Leslie Ann Warren does her own over-the-top tribute to Chicago. The original music is done by Henry Mancini, and thus another Pink Panther connection.

The costumes (done by Patricia Norris, a very experienced and wide-ranging costumer) are perfect, both for the stage production numbers (dramatic and with flair, as might befit a drag queen, then or now), and off the stage - the period setting of inter-war Paris, with the genteel poverty of some and the opulence of others side-by-side is very well done.

This is the first film in which I recall major gay figures - it was a popular film in part because the primary actors were well know, and the issue of gay life was presented both in a distant and a non-controversial manner. If there are politics in it at all, it is that sex shouldn't be a political issue. King Marchand, a bit upset at being identified as someone who might date a man (Victor) has one scene in which he re-affirms his masculinity (by going to a seedy bar and picking a fight), only to discover that people aren't always what he thought they were.

This could be a theme throughout the whole film - people are never what you think they are, and life never turns out as expected. The tone of the film is rather lighthearted throughout, and the situations play very well. Does King Marchand get the girl/guy? Does Carroll Toddy become the toast of Paris? Does Chicago get an airport?? See the film and find out.",1094083200,13,4309,4.81596752368065

121433,5,079074676X,"Although he has just recieved an honorary Oscar, Blake Edwards is often looked upon as a purvayer of low comedy. Although he is the genius behind such sparkling classics as The (original) Pink Panther and Breakfast at Tiffanys, many people frown upon him for his later films such as S.O.B., Blind Date and Switch (let's not mention the post-Sellars Panthers). Victor / Victoria falls, chronologically, between the two sets of films and, in my view, is Edwards at his peak.
Edwards directs his wife Julie Andrews (never better and that includes being a nanny and a nun), in a tale of a [woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman]. The central plot serves as an excellent backbone on which to hang a wonderfully farcical script, some hilarious set-pieces and the fantastic song-and-dance numbers (Bricuse and Mancini's score makes you wish they'd worked together more often).
Andrews, as I say, is flawless coming somewhere between the innocence of Poppins and the lewdness of S.O.B. and giving a fantastic performance. From under her very nose though, the film is stolen by the ever-watchable Robert Preston as Toddy. Preston brings great depth and love to a part that could quite easily have been, as he is refered to in the film, 'a pathetic old queen'.  James Garner commendably plays the straight-man (in more ways than one!) with a twinkle in his eye and Lesley Ann Warren hilariously chews every bit of scenery she lays her hands on.
The script, which bears Edwards' name as a co-writer, is as witty and moving as anything written in Hollywood's 'Golden Era' and the musical elements have as much vibrancy as MGM's in their hey-day. Musical highlights include Le Jazz Hot and The Shady Dame from Seville (not to mention the riotous reprise as performed by Preston for the films finale). One-liners don't come much better than ""A lot of men can't get it ... up to now, you've been fine"", ""You look like a raccoon"" (you need to see it) and the entire scene in the restaurant that leads to the line ""It is a moron who takes advice from a horse's arse"" (Edwards regular Graham Stark at his dead-pan best).
The extras on the DVD are limited to trailers and a commentary. The commentary by Edwards and Andrews is informative, if a little disappointing considering the wildness of the film and mainly consists of Edwards enjoying watching the film and Andrews making sure that all of the on and off-screen talent is name-checked.
A real unsung gem that deserves to be seen as often as possible. Tell your friends!",1089763200,3,2523,4.760273972602739
121434,5,079074676X,"There is one word that best describes this film, and it's RIOT. The film is one big and grand RIOT. The cockroach-instigated riot scene in the restaurant is memorable. Mr Edwards shot this from the outside so that we get to see a third-person view of what is going on inside through the windows. Also, look at that RIOTY performance by Leslie Ann Warren: the scene where she walks down the train aisle spurting out vehement %$&*$# should be made a classic!! Again, this was shot using a third-person view so that we see inside the train windows but never actually hear her. The film delights in its RIOTS, we get the feeling that it makes fun of its characters in this way, albeit a tender way.
  But beneath all the film's RIOTS, is a warm heart (highlighted by Henry Mancini's score.) This warm-hearted attitude transcends even through all those nightclub brawls; and I believe that without this formula, the film might not have been able to handle the issue of homosexuality so well. Excellent performances by Julie Andrews, James Garner, Robert Preston (in a delicious drag queen finale,) Leslie Ann Warren (show stealer) and the whole cast. The musical numbers are also winners. Certainly not for the Lazy Afternoon viewing, but for the Friday/Saturday night film. To those who are offended by gay contents, be warned, the film insists.

Great songs in - Julie's ""Le Jazz Hot"" & Lesley Warren's bimboesque ""Kings Can-Can"". The sexual chemistry is A+++ between Andrews & a sexually confused James Garner  who plays ""King Marchand"" a Chicago club owner, who is so TOTALLY out of his element in Paris, let alone being sexually frustrated and confused over his crush on the beautiful, stylish and gay, Victor.

121436,4,079074676X,"This Blake Edwards film is a sort of valentine to the many gifts of his amazing wife Julie Andrews more than ten years since her last musical, and wouldn't you know it, it was a gigantic hit. It helped that the book poked a great deal of fun at the homophobia of the nascent Reagan era, that James Garner, Alex Karres, Robert Preston and (especially) Lesley Ann Warren (in her funniest role ever, as the idiot dancehall bimbo Norma). But the real reason the film takes off is because of Julie Andrews. She may be utterly unbelievable passing as a man, but she does get to show her great gift for dry humor, and she sings several fine, fine songs, including what may be one of her absolute careeer highlights, ""Le Jazz Hot."" No one has ever been less appropriate for a jazz number than Julie--she of course sings every single note exactly on the beat, and with her signature perfect diction--, but she gives the number so much zing and warmth and excitement it just doesn't matter. When she's up there in her Josephine Baker outfit snapping her fingers and smiling expansively, and showing off her astonishing and perfect vocal range, she is every bit as showstopping and iconic as when she was spinning round the Salzburg mountaintops in THE SOUND OF MUSIC: she's up there in movie history heaven.

There is a lot of motion in this film,  but it is dying, like fish floundering in those buckets at open-air markets. And with stupendously wooden performances and coincidences so outlandish as to be irritating, I never felt anything above annoyed, and certainly felt more than annoyed in many scenes.
When the end mercifully arrived (is this movie six, or is it seven, hours long?), and I was supposed to laugh at Robert Preston playing Julie Andrews, I watched in a combination of shock and awe. Who would find this funny (apparently many people, judging by the reviews here). And who would try such a stupid scene? Blake Edwards hit the big time with some wonderfully talented people helping him, but this sterile, phony, insincere and stupid film is a waste on all levels.",1049328000,10,933,4.905063291139241

Victoria (beautifully plaid by Julie Andrews) is a performer who can not seem to get a job. Right as she is about to be evicted from her apartment and starve to death, she meets a cabaret performer (Robert Preston) recently fired from his nightclub. As the friendship strikes between them he comes up with an idea that could bring fame and fortune to both of them: Victoria should dress and introduce herself as Victor who happens to be a female impersonator. Thus we have Victoria pretending to be Victor impersonating Victoria. As if that was not complicated enough, add to this a mobster (James Garner) who is convinced that Victor is actually Victoria, and his short-fused floozy (Lesley Ann Warren, who is by the way brilliant) who thinks her mobster boyfriend is gay for falling for Victor and you've got non-stop action and laughter.

You'll find yourself singing along with the award winning music.  Not only is the script great, but the actors are the best, Julie Andrews and James Garner.

The musical numbers are as hot as the comedy.  Robert Preston plays Toddy, a gay impressario who is destine to make ""Victor"" the toast of Paris.  James Gardner is a big time bootlegger who discovers the truth and falls in love with Victoria.  Leslie Ann Warren is a hilariously, if at times grating, dumb blond.
Warner Brothers has done a wonderful job remastering this DVD.  Colors are warm, rich and vibrant.  For the most part, details are sharp.

This movie does not attempt to preach, it just has fun in that uniquely awesome inspired playful way all good gay men have that leaves the room howling with torrents of laughter.  The movie is a playful romp through 1930's Paris night life when it was taudry, common and the most fun you could have for so little money.  The movie is not over the top with Gay characters that was and is the nature of this part of show business.  Leave your prejudices at the door and let the movie be itself you will enjoy it even more that way.  Victor Victoria is just a playful imaginative whimsical what if delight not a documentary on gay issues.  Victor Victoria is a fun peek inside the very best of the gay show club life of this time period that might leave you with a better understanding of the universality of what it means to truly love another.

Whether or not you buy (or approve of) the premise of an openly gay 1930's Paris, there is much broad, warm, and witty comedy to enjoy here. Julie Andrews, one of the biggest movie stars in history, had created something of a paradox after the phenominal success of 'Mary Poppins' and 'The Sound Of Music-' and wished for many years following to shed her nun/governess image. The tacky 70's sex farce 'S.O.B.' was originally thought to be the film which would do it, but she makes an even more impressive departure here as she essays a classically trained singer who discovers a new kind of independence while playing a female impresonator. In retrospect it seems like an increrdible challenge for an actor/ress, and Ms. Andrews rises to the challenge, and passes with flying colors. And the voice is incredibly fine, especially in ""Le Jazz Hot"" and ""The Shady Dame from Seville,"" which has the distinction of showing the voice shatter glass.

There are no standout performances here: everyone from Julie Andrews to the bit players are uniformly superb.
 The commentary by Ms. Andrews and Blake Edwards is largely self-congratulatory, and there are frequent long lapses where they seem to forget what they're supposed to be doing and merely sit silently watching the movie.  It all seems too off-the-cuff.  They might have previewed the film and given a little thought to what they were going to say before the recorder was turned on.  But this is quibbling.

121473,5,079074676X,"Blake Edwards created a musical, comical, award-winning masterpiece with his film ""Victor/Victoria"", starring Julie Andrews, Robert Preston, James Garner, Lesley Ann Warren and Alex Karras.
Julie Andrews received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her portrayal of Victoria Grant/Count Victor Grezhinski, a divorced, American lounge singer struggling to make ends meet in 1934 Paris.  Unable to pay for rent or food, she decides to use a ruse at a restaurant to earn a free meal.  There she meets Carroll Todd (""Toddy""), played by Robert Preston who earned Best Actor nominations for both the Oscar and Golden Globe.  Also having financial difficulties, Toddy is inspired by Victoria's somewhat masculine-sounding voice when she gets angry to have her pretend to be gay male drag queen.  She agrees and she becomes an overnight success after her first performance at one of the most upscale nightclubs in Paris.  In the audience are King Marchand (James Garner), his girlfriend Norma Cassady (Lesley Ann Warren, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for both the Oscar & Golden Globe) and his bodygaurd Squash Bernstein (Alex Karras).
What makes this film such a masterpiece is not just the excellent comedic writing by Blake Edwards, but also the Oscar-winning music composed by Henry Mancini.  Count Victor Grezhinski (Julie Andrews) sings two of the most memorable songs ""Le Jazz Hot"" during her first nightclub performance and ""The Shady Dame from Seville"" during another nightclub performance.  She also sings the theme song ""Crazy World"" during a tear-felt nightclub performance.  Robert Preston as Toddy sings the fun song ""Gay Paree"" during a gay nightclub performance and does a hilarious reprise of ""The Shady Dame from Seville"" at the conclusion of the film.  He also sings ""You and Me"" with Victor at an impromptu performance at the same gay nightclub.  Another hilarious performance comes from Lesley Ann Warren singing ""Chicago, Illinois"" at King Marchand's nightclub in Chicago.
The rendering of the film onto DVD is superb, as is the Dolby 5.1 sound quality.  You simply cannot go wrong owning this DVD because you will be able to enjoy it for years to come!",1030492800,27,2228,5.161111111111111

Watching it again on DVD I am extremely impressed with the quality of the transfer. The colors are richly preserved, the picture is in it's original Widescreen format and the soundtrack is in 5.1 surround. But the most wonderful thing is the ability to listen to two of cinema's greats, Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards, giving us their insights in a feature length commentary.

121476,5,079074676X,"Victor/Victoria is easily Blake Edwards' best film.  In fact, Victor/Victoria is probably one of the top 10 best films of the 1980s.  From the lighting, to the art direction-set decoration, to the superb acting, to the screenplay, to the cinematography, and to the late Henry Mancini's remarkable score (he died in 1994), this film is the epitome of top notch and smart entertainment.
After the release of Victor/Victoria, the movie musical died, except for some of the Disney animated features released since Victor/Victoria (i.e., the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King).  The recent release of ""Moulin Rouge"" could be the beginning of a trend to bring back the movie musical with live actors.  There also appears to be a current trend for movies (and some television shows) to incorporate musical numbers for laughs (i.e., Austin Powers, some Mel Brooks movies, Will & Grace, a recent episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer).
One of the factors that made Victor/Victoria a successful musical for its time is the manner in which Blake Edwards structured and directed all of the film's musical numbers.  The ""break-out-and-sing musicals"" with an imaginary orchestra in the background (i.e., My Fair Lady, Sound of Music, Hello Dolly!) were already outdated when Victor/Victoria was released in 1982 (and in my opinion, I think that the ""break-out-and-sing"" element is what made ""Evita"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" a bit cheesy).  Blake Edwards made the right decision to incorporate all of the musical numbers as stage performances to audiences WITHIN the movie, making the movie more realistic to audiences WATCHING the film.
All in all, the film received 7 Oscar nominations.  It only won an Oscar for Best Original Song Score.  The acting and the chemistry of the actors were superb.  In my opinion, Leslie Ann Warren (Best Supporting Actress nominee), Julie Andrews (Best Actress nominee), and the late Robert Preston (Best Supporting Actor nominee) all should have received acting Oscars.  Even Alex Karras (a former college football player who was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy in 1957) delivered a fantastic and funny performance as King Marchand's (played by James Garner) closeted bodyguard named Squash.  Incredibly, Victor/Victoria was not nominated for Best Picture or Best Director.  Ghandi, E.T., Tootsie, the Verdict, and Missing were all nominated for Best Picture (all were also nominated for Best Director, except for Missing), with Ghandi being the big winner.  In my opinion, Victor/Victoria was the best picture for 1982.
My favorite element of the film is Henry Mancini's remarkable score and original songs, with lyrics written by Leslie Bricusse.  As I mentioned above, Mancini (who died in 1994) and Bricusse received the Oscar for Best Original Song Score.  ""Le Jazz Hot"", the first song Andrews sings in the movie as a ""drag queen"", is a showstopper.  The movie version of ""Le Jazz Hot"" is far superior to the Broadway version of the same song.  ""Crazy World"" is a fantastic ballad, and many female concert performers have added this song to their repertoire.  Clearly, Mancini's Victor/Victoria score far exceeded any other film score he ever wrote during his lifetime.
As for the DVD itself, the video transfer and the re-mastered soundtrack are superb.  What boggles my mind is why it took MGM so long to release the movie on DVD.  This is the type of movie that DVD players were made for!  With the exception of one theatrical trailer and a feature-length audio commentary with Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards, the film has no additional ""extra features"".  It would have been fun to see some of the film's deleted scenes, some of the film's outakes, a documentary of the making of the film, and updated cast interviews.  Because of Mancini's remarkable score and original songs, a ""music-only"" audio track should also have been included on the DVD.
Julie Andrews talks a lot more than Blake Edwards during the feature-length audio commentary.  Blake Edwards is relatively quiet after the first 15 minutes of the commentary.  He admitted during the commentary that he got caught up in viewing the movie (it sounds like he had not seen it for some time).  In any event, the husband and wife team provides behind the scenes information that is interesting and occassionally funny, although not as comprehensive as the viewer may have expected.
Although Victor/Victoria is 20 years old, the movie could be released today as it was originally filmed.  This is because the story takes place in Paris in 1934 and because Blake Edwards directed Victor/Victoria with style and artistic qualities that make the movie relevant and modern enough to watch in 2002.  Victor/Victoria is more than just a musical comedy.  It is a story about sexuality, gender, and becoming comfortable living in your own skin.  Victor/Victoria teaches us to seek out our dreams and happiness, even if achieving these things requires us to make sacrifices and take risks.  Any fan of Blake Edwards, Henry Mancini, Julie Andrews, musical comedies, or just good, quality movies should buy Victor/Victoria for his or her DVD library.",1028246400,9,5147,5.113500597371565

James Gardner is her perfect foil, taciturn and quiet.  The chemistry between the two is believable.  All the supporting roles were cast perfectly.

And the music and staging.  I bought the song book just so that I could learn to sing all of them, especially Crazy World.  Seeing Ms Andres wearing tux and slicked back hair, along by the piano singing this song was the highlight of the film.  I can watch and listen to it time and time again.

121479,5,079074676X,"This is an absolutely delightful musical and everyone in it sparkles.  Director Blake Edwards surrounds Andrews with a wonderful ensemble cast and it all works beautifully.  Robert Preston, of the ""Music Man,"" does a fine musical turn with Andrews as her gay cohort in her drag act. She poses as Victor, a man impersonating a woman, so that she can be employed as a singer.  She is very successful in this deceit with her smash act.

James Garner is an American millionaire who goes through fits wondering whether she is a man or a woman and, when he's convinced she is a man, goes into a crisis over his own manhood since he's attracted to him/her.  Garner is wonderfully funny but no more so than Lesley Ann Downe as his girlfriend, with the mouth from the wrong side of the tracks, who makes us howl every time she speaks.  All in all, a great romantic comedy between Garner and Andrews with fabulous musical numbers and a dream supporting cast.

She is surrounded by a cast that is beyond superb. Everyone shines in this!! Robert Preston is hilarious as Toddy and that last scene in the movie when he is dressed up like a Spanish senorita is a scream. There is nice work from both James Garner as a Chicago gangster and Alex Karras as his closeted bodyguard. Leslie Ann Warren nearly steals the picture as James Garner's screechingly loud blonde girlfriend who can't understand his attraction to a Polish drag queen.

121506,5,079074676X,"I can say this --- I never saw the whole movie back in the early 80's when it was on cable t.v.  I had seen bits and pieces, and it appeared very odd to me.
Now that I am older, wiser and have more control over the clicker, when I found this on PBS this past Sunday night, I couldn't resist it.  Who can resist Julie Andrews singing?  She is just utterly stunning in this movie. I also feel that for her take this part was a very bold statement on her part.  It is such a departue from roles like Mary Poppins and Maria, and even the fair Eliza Doolittle, which she originated on Broadway. I'm sure her being married to the film's director, Blake Edwards, had something to do with her being in this movie, and I am so glad she did it!
""A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman""..this pretty much sums up the generality of the films' premise.  She is Victoria, a down on her luck singer in clubs in Paris.  It's when she meets up with Drag Queen, Toddie, played to the hilt by Robert Preston, the the scheme falls into play -- Enter Victor, the man role she plays.  Toddie comes up with the idea.
King Marchand, played coolly and quite humorously by the charming James Garner, is the man who falls for Victor.  It really isn't as confusing as it sounds.  I am pretty sure Marchand knew it was a woman all along.  Victor becomes quite a showstopper in Paris.  Eventually, Victor/Victoria, tells the truth.  Watch to see what happens in the romance category.
The acting all around in this film is awesome. Andrews, Preston, and Lesley Ann Warren, who plays the ditzy blond character, Norma, were all nominated for Oscars. And deservantly so!
The music is great.  The era was jazz, and Andrews really shows off her amazing vocal range here. The woman is such an amazing and talented entertainer.  Preston and Andrews have a great chemistry on screen and stage together.  Even if he is a drag queen, and she isn't really a man, they still shine together.
Let's remember this is a Blake Edwards' movie. He brought us the Pink Pather movies, and ""Ten"".  These were all very funny films, and this is very funny too.  This is a fun, comical, musical film that stars very talented performers.

And a I glad I did; I taped the movie, and every tme  watch it, I find it funnier. This truly is one of the greatest musicals ever made. Julie is perfect for the part of Victor/Victoria. Many people have summarized the story so I won't go into details. Lesley Ann Warren was wonderfully funny, and Robert Preston is a riot, especially in the last scene. If you may have prejudice about the story, as I did, don't stop watching it. It is undeniably hilarious and this new DVD release is just on time.

I would like to point out that Leslie Ann Warren's number was not ""King's Can-Can"", it was ""Chicago, Illinois"". I wonder how someone who has seen the movie could make such a blatant error in a review, especially a critic! I have both the remastered soundtrack and the Broadway DVD version, which is, to say the least, not even half as good as the movie. But it does have it's own flair, and I appreciate it just for that. There is nothing I can say that has not already been said so I will say this.

121522,5,079074676X,"""Victor/Victoria"". Practically everyone has heard of it. Whenever it comes up in a coversation I'm in, atleast three people say ""Victor/Victoria? That was a really funny movie"". Believe me, that's happened to me so many times.  And it IS a *REALLY FUNNY* movie. It's hard to get funnier. But that's just Blake Edwards' style. And playing the title role is the amazing Julie Andrews. And no one knows Blake Edwards' style better than Julie Andrews. Julie and Blake have been married since 1969. And since this was made in 1982...well you get the picture. Julie was up for an Academy Award for Victor/Victoria (she'd won Bes Actress previously for 'Mary Poppins' in 1964) to honor her stunning performance. She is absobloominlutely (see Julie's 'My Fair Lady') fabulous. As they say in England, she's ""Ab Fab"".
No one else could have mastered Victoria as well as Julie or even at all.

The principals all do a marvelous job.  But one thing that really sets this movie apart is its use of well-crafted (and often hysterical) minor characters and little ""bits"".  The waiter who comments, ""How lucky can you get?  In one evening, I serve a Rockefeller, and a Groucho Marx.""  The poor hotel guest who keeps trying to put his shoes out in the hall to be shined, only to be intimidated by the antics going on out there.  The Clousseau-type detective whose luck seems to run from bad to worse.

On the left of the page under ""Explore this DVD,"" I clicked on ""quotes & trivia,"" and found the amazing MISinformation below about the opera Madame Butterfly: ""The opera, attended by King and Victoria, is Puccini's ""Madamea Butterfly"" which is, fittingly, about a man masquerading as a woman.""  There is NO ""man masquerading as a woman"" in Puccini's opera; I think the writer has confused the opera with the play about REAL PEOPLE with a similar title.
I have seen Julie Andrews say in an interview that her husband chose Madame Butterfly for that scene knowing that it always makes her cry, and that she cried that day for a LONG time, effortlessly, as they worked on the scene.",1009756800,2,796,4.559440559440559
121526,5,079074676X,"In the age of ""Moulin Rouge"" audiences would do far better by rediscovering this musical comedy gem, starring the incomparable Julie Andrews, Robert Preston, Leslie Ann Warren and James Garner.  Rarely has Hollywood captured the essence of great music with outstanding performances as it has in ""Victor/Victoria.""  There are literally a dozen or so scenes that will leave you hysterical, as in gasping-for-breath hysterical, something many films aspire to, but few ever deliver on.  But more than funny, this is a poignant, character driven film where every principal is allowed to shine.
Andrews permanently sheds her ""Sound of Music"" virginal skin in the title role, embodying the man-pretenting-to-be-a-woman-pretending-to-be-a-man part in a way noone has ever done before or since.  Of course, the audience is in on the joke, but it never becomes tired or anything less than fresh.  Robert Preston is the antithesis of his former ""Music Man"" personna, a gay-Paree emcee who discover's Victor's startling 8-octave vocal range and turns him/her into the rage of Paris.  These two performances, along with Leslie Ann Warren's unforgettable floosy - all three Oscar-nominated - are drop dead fabulous.  These are actors at the very height of their form....funny, passionate, real and endearing.  The musical highlights are truly phenomenal, certainly better than other ""best loved"" musicals like ""Singing In the Rain"" or ""An American In Paris.""  Andrews scores on ""Le Jazz Hot"" and shows an indelible comic flair few people knew she was capable of in the legendary cafeteria sequence, which literally had the audience I viewed this with ROLLING in the aisles.  It's a movie where even the insects - cockroaches in this case - are memorable.  But more so, its also a lesson in what Hollywood USED to do so well in its tradition of movie musicals....and what its forgotten to do over the past two decades since Victor/Victoria was released.  In a nutshell, Hollywood forgot that the power of song and music is their ability to HUMANIZE a character and progress the plot, but also lend depth and color to the principals.  For me, ""Victor/Victoria"" IS Hollywood's last great musical, and certainly one of the most visually stunning, fully realized films of our time.  This ranks far and away as Blake Edward's crowning masterpiece - high above SOB or the Pink Panther flicks.  And the supporting performances are some of the best ever caqptured.  Just try and forget Warren's cooing to James Garner (""pooookie....I'm horny) or Alex Karras' gay gangster falling in love with Preston.  From roaches to royalty, ""Victor/Victoria"" is quite simply one of the best films of the 80's or any other decade.
I am anxiously awaiting its release on DVD, and secretly hoping that the currently available Broadway show version silently goes away as it cannot hold a candle to the film.  Rent it, buy it, LOVE IT.",997056000,72,2894,5.10828025477707

Catapulting musical movies into a new era with sexy banter, a  transsexual/homosexual/whatever sexual candy box assortment of players,  Blake Edwards put his considerable gifts for farce and style to wonderful,  transporting use here.  There is nary a stumble, and the Mancini score is  filled with those rare  kinds of songs that seem nostalgic, yet they are  new -- or at least were new in their day.  The settings and costumes place  you in a delightfully plush Paris; you can practically smell the wine and  smoke.  And the performances -- well, each is a revelation, beginning with  Julie's delightful -- and skillful -- cross-dresser; James Garner will  surprise you with humor and not a little sly wit; Leslie Anne Warren is one  of those saucepots who steals virtually every scene she appears in, easily.  You will laugh, be moved, tap your toes, and be thoroughly enchanted with  V/V.  Unfortunately, the musical production, also directed by Mr. Edwards  and originially starring Ms. Andrews, is not nearly so perfectly arranged  -- it is thin, flat and somehow squeezes the life out of the story, so be  warned, since they do share the same name and many of the same  contributors, when you are buying!",961632000,6,1364,5.04954954954955
