2386141,4,B000ADWDEI,"It's one of the oldest clichs in the book:  The misfit team of losers who have to pull together to win; and not just win a single game, but the whole championship.  This is usually the stuff of gaggy sports dramas, but with Will Ferrell thrown into the mix, it's bound to be full of laughs.  And ""Kicking and Screaming"" is certainly funny, mostly thanks to the popular SNL alumnus.

 As Phil, a wimpy soccer dad, Ferrell excels at being the inept dork he is usually cast as.  Living for years under the thumb of his abrasive father, Buck (Robert Duvall), Phil has developed a quasi-hippie, peace-loving mentality, but is unexpectedly conscripted to be the coach of the last-place Tigers, while his dad coaches the champion Gladiators.

 Being a coach seems to go completely against his non-aggressive personality, and Phil is soon in over his head simply trying to get the kids to practice.

 In order to add some family tension to the whole mess in a completely nonsensical way, Phil has a younger brother who is the same age as his own son, and the two boys play on their respective father's team.  Without a doubt, this is one of the most confusing family setups I've ever seen in this kind of movie.

 To aid Phil in his almost impossible task of training his team of misfits, he gets the help of Mike Ditka, who just so happens to be Buck's next-door neighbor, and who jumps at the chance to best him.  Ditka is more of a personality than a real actor, but his toughness makes for a good contrast to Phil's wimpiness.

 The movie is classic Ferrell humor; it's only really funny when he's running about, acting like a lunatic, and  he's quite good at that.  Phil gradually loses his sense of fun for the sport, and becomes obsessed with winning (as well as addicted to coffee), and simply goes nuts.

 Always a good indicator for comedies:  this film managed to have a funny trailer without giving away every good joke it had, again primarily thanks to Will Ferrell's incredible improvisational abilities.  It seemed like he was always saying or doing something worthy of a laugh.

 ""Kicking and Screaming"", though it may be a silly comedy, provides strong commentary on the disturbing trend for parents to become far too involved in their kid's sports teams, and Ferrell's performance, while entertaining and funny, should serve as testament to what can happen to these over-enthused parents.

 Despite its blandly predictable ""winning isn't everything"" moral, this film manages to remain fun and still get the message across without beating the audience over the head with it.",1116028800,,2583,4.748314606741573

2386360,5,B000ADWDEI,"This, along with the much maligned Bewitched, is one of my favorite Will Ferrell movies. Unlike his most recent Anchorman 2 (raunchy, rude and not worth watching; really, Will, do you not make enough money that you have to put rude sex jokes in?), Kicking and Bewitched are fun and entertaining. Don't understand at all why Bewitched didn't do better. I thought Ferrell's scene at the table (Kidman puts a spell on him) was one of the best he's ever done. Bewitched is ridiculously underrated and should be bought for its sweetness and because it was fabulously well done. Further, talk all you want about Kidman in Cold Mountain or ...whatever...this is my favorite performance she has done, along with the Tom Cruise movie Far and Away. By the way...and just saying...does Kidman send Cruise a thank you note every year for giving her a career? One she would not have if not for Cruise's generosity (Cruise may be one of the last truly great movie stars: applause applause).

Kicking and Screaming is just flat out fun. Really enjoyed this and as I write this, I can't recall anything overly sexy rude about it so (unless I'm forgetting something?) it is a family friendly watch.",1419120000,2,1181,4.760975609756097

2386393,5,B000ADWDEI,"I'm not the worlds biggest Will Ferrell fan, but I find this movie absolutely hilarious. I have through dozens and dozens of sports movies and I hate them and find them totally formulaic. I can't figure out which aspect of this movie is funnier: the fact that it is an extremely clever spoof of the ""under-dog"" sports movie or Ferrell's performance of a man slowly driven to madness by his overbearing father and Mike Dicta. It' had plenty of off-beat quirky moments that caught me by surprise. Most people haven't seen it, and it might be because trying to walk an awkward line between being a kids movie and a grown up movie. However there isn't in raunchy stuff in it so it's fine for kids even though some of the subtler humor may go over their heads (i.e, the awkwardness of Will Ferrell's dad marrying a woman younger than his own wife). If your looking for a Not-to-heavy comedy to get a few laughs, I'd say go for it.",1403395200,,925,4.447058823529412

2386405,2,B000ADWDEI,"This movie is so almost funny that I watched it with my kids twice -- once when they were too young to understand it, and a second time when they'd seen enough good Will Ferrell comedies to want to see another and we couldn't find anything else that night on Amazon Prime. There are some funny scenes in the movie, like when Ferrell becomes hyper-competitive and starts abusing the kids on his son's soccer team, but overall, the storyline and the humor are way too canned. You can see most of the jokes coming from a mile away, and they fall flat on arrival. Couple that with a dull predictable story, and there's not a lot to love. I enjoy Will Ferrell movies, and his man-child characters are among the best, but you can make do watching the highlights of this one on YouTube. Don't subject yourself to the whole movie once ... let alone twice, like I did, which will leave you kicking and screaming for the remote.",1388707200,,918,4.437869822485207
2386406,4,B000ADWDEI,"This is a fun sports movie as well as a look at relationships between parents and their (sometimes grown) children.  Phil (Will Ferrell) is likable as a dad who inadvertently ends up coaching his son's soccer team with Mike Ditka, hysterical as the assistant coach.  Phil's own father and rival coach (Robert Duvall) does a great job of lampooning the all-too-serious competitive nature that often accompanies the over-zealous parents of children on sports teams.  Phil is determined to be a different dad than the one he had, but discovers a side to himself he didn't know existed as a caffeinated coach.",1388188800,,605,4.97029702970297

2386414,3,B000ADWDEI,This movie is fairly entertaining but it basically reproduces the archetypical kid sports movie formula.  Fans of Will Ferrell will find his over-the-top antics to rescue the movie from being completely trite.,1381190400,,209,5.53125

2386434,3,B000ADWDEI,"Kicking and Screaming is sort of a mixed bag. I think at points it will appeal to the Will Farrell fans, which I consider myself to be. There's enough of Ferrell's zaniness in the film to entertain you, but, as usual, he goes a bit over-the-top and this might grate on your nerves. I think Ferrell can really carry a film with his antics, though, so I guess I'm a little partial to his films. The plot of the film, while passable, is very formulaic in its underdog overcomes bully and main character learns his lesson in a rushed, trite, predictable way. Farrell plays a man who is second fiddle to his father, who is a perennial ""winner."" As you might guess, Ferrell becomes coach of a group of losers who he tries to turn into winners, all the while trying to be a good father figure to his son. As he tries to compete with his father (Robert Duvall), he seems to lose his mind over winning (and drinking copious amounts of caffeine). You will probably see his epiphany before he does. It's a film that is entertaining and funny mostly, but you will probably feel like you've seen it before.

There are a few funny extras included in the disc that are worth watching, most notably the outtakes with some of kids.

In total, Kicking and Screaming is a funny film, but don't expect too much.",1367020800,,1291,4.420168067226891

Even the addition of Mike Ditka, the historical coach of the Chicago Bears - my favorite team - couldn't really save this retread.  The coffee bit was boring, the soccer angle was contrived, the addition of the superstar players has been done a million times before, and we all know that the kid who is forgotten about is going to pull through in the end.

It's cute, and probably works for the kids, but it's a lot like watching an actual soccer match.  There may be one or two goals, and one or two excited moments, but for the most part it's grown men throwing fits and rolling around on the ground in poorly acted agony.  It's good for a light laugh, but not much more.",1230940800,,922,4.414201183431953
2386472,4,B000ADWDEI,"I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell and so I was excited when this movie was released.  Although I never got a chance to see it in the theater I rushed to buy the DVD once it was released much to my wife's dismay, since she doesn't share the same love of Ferrell.  The greatest thing about this film is that, while Ferrell may have to reign in some of the outlandish remarks that make him so funny in order to keep a lower rating and appeal to children and parents alike, he still maintains the same enthusiasm for his work and delivers a performance that is over the top, hilarious and spontaneous, and one that even my wife found enjoyable.  That's probably one of the most commendable traits here.  It serves as a really great family sports comedy, appealing to children but also giving the parents something to laugh at.

The film follows Phil Weston as he matches wits with his stubborn and overbearing father Buck.  Buck, played by Robert Duvall, has always been disappointed with Phil who never shared his father's love of sports and everything manly.  Instead Phil grew up to run a vitamin store, something Buck is somewhat ashamed of.  Throughout Phil's life his father always had to be the best, even if that meant trampling his own son down in the process, and now, years later when Phil's son Sammy gets the same treated from his dear old Grandpa, Phil has to take maters into his own hands.  He does that by offering to coach the loser team Buck traded Sammy to.  Buck is unsupportive but in the end it's the competition between the two Weston men that finally bonds them like they've never been before.

Will Ferrell shines here, with all the quarks and loud mouthed antics that make his more adult oriented fare so entertaining.  As Phil ditches his vitamins for coffee he becomes loud, obnoxious and downright out of control and it all adds up to a great deal of fun.  Duvall is also effective as Buck.  He's rude, mean and at times a downright tyrant.  The first time I watched this movie his character actually made me angry.  Mike Ditka is actually really funny as himself here.  All the children are effective and funny in their own rights as well.

The story is a sweet one at that, showing the importance of letting your children have fun and be themselves, of not adding undue pressure to their success and never allowing your own insecurities and self doubts to ruin your relationship with your child.  It shows the good and bad side of competition and the dangers of taking things too far.  But, in the end `Kicking and Screaming' is just good old fun and is one that the whole family can enjoy together time and time again.  I loved this movie (found it much more entertaining than the `Bad News Bears' remake released around the same time) and highly recommend it.  It may not be the best sports comedy out there, but what it lacks in originality it makes up in laughs.",1183680000,6,2891,4.508637236084453

2386476,3,B000ADWDEI,"This was actually a very good movie, but it could have been better. The problem is that the adult parts were played by extremely talented and experienced actors and so the course of least resistance was taken: Feature the adults and leave the kids in the background. While I'm sure that it is difficult working with child actors, this movie seemed a little unbalanced in that the adults completely over-whelmed the story. For instance, while the relationship between Ferrell's character and Duvall's character got plenty of attention, the relationship between their sons was all but ignored. This was a rather unique situation. Although Ferrel's and Duvall's sons were the same age, one was the brother of Ferrell's character and the uncle of Ferrell's character's son! Again, it's understandable that the easy way out was taken given the immense talent of the adult actors, but it would have been nice if more attention had been paid to the child characters given this unique situation.

Ditka was a lot of fun in this movie, although he basically just played himself. The bonus features that come with the movie are also worth viewing. All in all, I'd give the movie three stars and a wink and I think most people will find it to be an amusing and easy to enjoy comedy, BUT I still feel that it fell short of what it could have been!",1174694400,,1335,4.7296137339055795

2386479,4,B000ADWDEI,"A librarian friend's review (from the Monroe County Library System webpage):

Will Ferrell is a giant among goofballs. He survived the Saturday Night Live experience intact and has gone on to perfect a comic delivery in movies as odd and memorable as any in recent years. Unlike most other SNL success stories, Ferrell is a consistent master at improvising small nonsensical lines. Take a look at some of the extras on his dvds and you'll see what I mean.

Even if Ferrell, like Bill Murray, moves on to movies that are only funny to adults, he will always be remembered as one of movies' greatest goofballs. Kicking and Screaming (2005) isn't a great movie, but it's another chance to see a master in his prime. Consider how short a run goofball giant Jim Carrey had.  He struck gold with Ace Ventura (1993), followed that nicely with Dumb & Dumber (1994), but by the time he appeared in Ace Ventura II (1995) and The Cable Guy (1996), it was clear his glory days were over and he'd better start picking projects more carefully. Ferrell struck gold in Old School (2003), followed that nicely with Elf (2003), continued the weird adventure by scripting and acting in the movie Anchorman (2004), and only lets us down in a minor way by hamming it up now in a movie made for children.

He may not be Lenny Bruce, W.C. Fields, or Andy Kauffman, but then, who is?",1171497600,,1359,4.580246913580247
2386480,3,B000ADWDEI,"Kicking and Screaming is another underdog sports story with the requisite funny guy who has to help the losing team become winners.  In this movie, the funny guy is played by Will Ferrell and the losing team hits close to home because his son is a member.

All of his life Phil Weston (Ferrell) lived in the shadow of his father's sports aspirations.  He was clumsy, uncoordinated and never really succeeded at any of the sports he tried; Phil's father, Buck Weston ""King of Sporting Goods,"" has always been disappointed in his son's athletic prowess and the two have a running air of competition throughout their lives.  When Phil gets engaged, his father does too. When Phil's son is born, the same day he gets a little brother. All of this leads up to Buck coaching a little league soccer team that both boys participate in.  However, Phil's son, true to form, is benched most of the time and eventually traded to a rival team where Phil becomes the coach. With the help of a caffeine addiction, soccer DVDs, and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, Phil does everything in his power to try to beat his father's team in the championships.

This movie is like so many other underdog sports stories like The Benchwarmers, Dodgeball, and Ladybugs, but fun nonetheless. The deleted scenes and outtakes are also not to be missed.  Overall, if you're a fan of Will Ferrell and kiddie sports movies, you can't go wrong with Kicking and Screaming.",1163635200,4,1444,4.7063492063492065

Duvall did well in his role as Ferrell's dad, but this isn't the kind of movie I would have expected him in. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell and his movies, then you will enjoy this film 100%. Everything fans like about him are still here in this movie, he is the current king of physical comedy!",1161216000,,587,4.113043478260869
2386482,4,B000ADWDEI,"Okay, so sports movies are a dime-a-dozen, as are Will Ferrell movies.  The difference is that sports movies can get repetitive and boring, while Ferrell movies can get repetitive but, at least to me, are never boring.  I love Will, I just think he's absolutely hilarious, and his character in 'Kicking and Screaming' is no exception!

Ferrell plays Phil Weston, a vitamin salesman who lives under a shell his over critical father Buck (Duvall who is brilliantly evil here) placed him in as a child.  Phil swore never to do that to his son who seemed to get the same sports handicaps that Phil grew up with.  When Buck trades his own grandson to the loser team this sends Phil into a vengeful state, to the point where he enlists the help of Mike Ditka (yes, the real Ditka) to help him coach the team of misfit children in order to play his fathers team of super athletes.

Phil's transformation from shy and timid to uncontrollably competitive is absolutely hilarious!  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it has enough in it to satisfy any fan of Ferrell and even some who just want a decent family comedy.  Unlike the similar 'Bad News Bears' 'Kicking and Screaming' has nothing offensive and is just plain clean fun.  I recommend it.",1155168000,,1245,4.597285067873303
2386483,4,B000ADWDEI,"Let's get a few things straight right off the bat, okay?

1. Not every movie ever made has to be thought provoking and artistically satisfying.

2. Will Ferrell will probably never be mentioned in the same breath as De Niro and Pacino.

If you can get on board with these two statements, then you might just enjoy ""Kicking & Screaming"". Let's face it, the premise is almost absurd, but isn't absurdity the stuff of good comedy?

Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is upset that his son Sam is nothing more than a bench warmer on the soccer team coached by his father Buck Weston (Robert Duvall). To appease Phil, Buck trades Sam to a rival soccer team so he can get more playing time, and through a series of events Phil becomes the coach of Sam's new team. The only problem is Phil knows nothing about soccer. What follows is a string of hilarious moments that culminate with a Father versus Son coached championship match.

As a whole this is not a great movie, but there are many moments that are laugh out loud hilarious, and it seems the more you watch it, the more you like it. Ferrell is in rare form as he slowly transforms from the milquetoast, quiet, inept coach to the win at all cost clone of his father. His rants will leave you with a ton of quotable lines that will make you laugh just thinking about them. Obviously Will Ferrell movies are targeted to a specific audience; I guess I happen to be one of them.

There are a lot of lessons in this movie that you don't want your kids to learn, as well as some choice swearing by Ditka in the bonus feature section.  Why??  Did they think the kids needed more vocabulary words? Thanks, but no thanks.

2386485,1,B000ADWDEI,"Formulaic. Forced. Unfunny.

Memo to Hollywood producers: Growing quite weary of ""men-behaving-badly"" movies. In this awkward movie, Will Ferrell play a father who is stunngingly, amazingly clueless about the impact of this juvenile behavior on his wife and children.

The whole caffeine schtick seems out of place and force, and a coach running out onto the field to push a child down dragged this movie to new lows. Ferrell's character is SO clueless that his 'transformation' back to nice guy at the end of the movie seems completely strategic--designed only to bring the movie to happy ending.

The other talent in this movie was completely wasted, most notably Robert Duvall and Kate Walsh. They both worked hard to save it, but the movie conspires against them. Duvall seemed bored with his lines. The only moment of real acting was when Duvall kissed his grandson toward the end of the movie. A quite beautiful scene, but lost in this very poor movie.

Will Ferrell can be humorous - my family enjoyed him in ""Elf"". ""Kicking and Screaming"" had the makings of a hilarious movie.

2386486,4,B000ADWDEI,"I'm not sure if anybody noticed but Kicking And Screaming reminds me a lot of a great classic film called The Little Giants and yes that movie is from my generation, I was 6 and never stopped watching it. My point is that this film is really like the little giants for the new generation of kids. You see a lot of actors who are getting older like Eddie Murphy but in this case Will Ferrell that are realizing that they want to put out films that kids can enjoy. I really don't think Will was intending a bunch of couples and grown people coming to see this movie with no kids in hand. The film borrows the concept of little giants except it's Father's team competing against the underdog son's team and its soccer.

Though this movie didn't reach the greatness of little giants it may be this generation's classic. It's a very enjoyable film even if you are a soccer coach or you enjoy soccer. I think all that really matters is if this movie is safe for your child to watch and will it make them laugh and keep them occupied, trust me it will. The soccer action is very powerful but most of the highlight plays are from the very talented children from Italy will recruited to make his bad team better. Will does a great job and so does Mike Ditka who added some heat to the mix. I wrote this review to let parents know that it's a great family film that will give a lot of laughs, drop a few jaws after seeing how amazing some of the kids are, and give the kids something to do other than bug you. I see a lot of people taking kids movies too seriously like their trying to win an Oscar but all in all Kicking and Screaming is pretty good.",1147478400,3,1641,4.193037974683544

Robert Duvall lends the film an importance presence and additional laughs as the highly competitive Buck Weston, sporting goods king and highly successful coach of the Youth Soccer League Gladiators team. Phil (Ferrell) has never been able to get a leg up on his father - but certainly not from lack of effort. When he got married, his father got re-married; when he had a son, his father's wife gave birth to a son (slightly larger, of course) the same day. Young Sam and his equally young uncle Bucky play for the Gladiators, Buck's team, and they are all but unbeatable. Sam, though, is the proverbial benchwarmer, so Buck decides to trade his own grandson to the league's worst team. Yes, it's another team of misfits of all shapes and sizes that just need an incredible coach to take them to unsuspected glory. That coach is nowhere to be seen, and Phil ends up taking on the job.

That's when the competitive juices start flowing. The first big move Phil makes is to take on an assistant coach, his dad's neighbor and long-time enemy Mike Ditka. Iron Mike is surprisingly good in this film and more than holds his own beside both Ferrell and Duvall. He only takes the job to try and make Buck's life more difficult, but he soon goes about whipping the little misfits into shape. The team still stinks, but their fortunes begin to change when Ditka and Phil bring in two new players, a pair of Italian kids who were apparently born with soccer balls balanced on their feet. The team begins winning, and with every win Phil goes a little more cuckoo for cocoa puffs; his new coffee addiction doesn't really help, either. Sure, it's funny to watch Ferrell go about inspiring his team in pretty unorthodox ways, but it eventually gets to the point that the whole thing stops being funny. Even Ditka can't get behind telling the kids to cheat (without getting caught, of course) or break a few clavicles. Ferrell's character just goes so over-the-top that you just want to slap him; he lets the desire to beat his dad corrupt him completely, and the lack of moderation in the second half of the film is a real negative.

There are a lot of laughs to be had in Kicking and Screaming. It's exceedingly formulaic and predictable, but that doesn't matter all that much as long as the laughs keep coming. The script just takes Ferrell's character way too far over the line; watching a crazy guy coach soccer is funny, but watching a freak going bonkers on the sidelines is more annoying than anything else. The film could really have used more Ditka in the later stages. Don't go thinking this is some cameo by Iron Mike; he gets a lot of screen time, and he makes this movie better and funnier with all of his trademark habits.

In the end, Kicking and Screaming is a very funny movie, but it's not a great comedy. Despite excellent performances all around (especially Ditka's), the film is just too over-the-top for its own good. You can't say the movie tries to be anything more than it is, though - it's all about generating laughs and nothing else.",1135123200,11,3330,4.574539363484087
2386492,4,B000ADWDEI,"From the very little that I'd heard about this movie, I believed it to be a ""family"" or children's movie.  I suppose I thought Ferrell's performance would be watered down and unlike the chracters he'd played in Anchorman and his other films.  That did not turn out to be the case at all.

Will Ferrell is absolutely hilarious in his role of a quiet and repressed man who comes out of his shell when he is left to coach his son's soccer team in a league dominated by his father's team: The Gladiators.  Ferrell coaches the Tigers and makes a bet with his father that he would defeat his team in the finals.

Ferrell enlists the help of ex-Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka to provide some guidance.  Ditka tuns him on to coffee drinking and Ferrell takes it a step too far, becoming a raving, caffeine-fiend lunatic who pushes his team to ""break collar bones"" and play dirty but not get caught.

This is the type of comedy Will Ferrell fans have come to expect and I would put this performance up there with his others.

Definitely a recommended viewing.",1134604800,13,1050,4.489473684210527
2386493,4,B000ADWDEI,"I recommend this film because it is good for kids and adults and because it is an easy movie to follow. However, I wouldn't recommend buying it, I would only rent it.

 I really did connect with little Sam because his dad only started coaching for fun and then become obsessive over winning. I have had an experience like this one when my dad wanted to coach my basketball team. Of course I wanted him to because he is my dad, but he and I both became obsessive over winning and forgot how much fun we can have, similar to the movie.

 This movie is a good choice for kids and adults. It is almost as if kids can look up to the kids in the movie and say I want to be as good as they are. It also shows them that it is not impossible to learn new skills because in the championship game the weaker players had learned new skills and they all came together to win the championship. As for adults, it is a good learning tool. They always think they don't do stuff like that, but come to find out they do. It can seem as if the examples of how the coach acts are a little outrageous, but it dose and can happen. I think it can help the adults see what not to do in these types of situations. With a little humor the movie is fun for everyone.

 This movie is also easy to follow. I know for most movies now a day, you can't turn your head for one minute without having to rewind and watch it again. That won't happen with this movie. That plot is simple, little Sam get traded from his grandfathers team because he didn't get to play and wasn't as skilled as the others, then his dad decides to coach Sam's new team and it just becomes a competition between grandfather and dad. Sam gets hurt in a series of ways. First, Sam thinks his dad took him off his grandfather's team because he wasn't as good as everyone else. Second, he gets put on a new team who has never won a game before. Third, his dad gets so obsessed with winning that he doesn't play Sam because he isn't as good as the other players.

On the other hand, I wouldn't personally go out and buy this movie. This movie would be good for family night. I did myself watch the movie twice and although it was still funny it got kind of boring because I knew the plot.",1134604800,2,2225,4.101149425287356

When family man Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) takes a job coaching his 10-year-old son's talented soccer team, he winds up going head to head with his ultra-competitive father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who coaches an opposing team. With the league championship at stake, father and son reignite old battles and go to hilarious extremes as they compete for the shiny trophy. Not one of Will Ferrell's best movie but it has humor. It's definitely worth watching. Soccer fans will appreciate it. lol.",1134432000,,563,5.064516129032258
2386495,3,B000ADWDEI,"Will Ferrell now one of the hottest stars in Hollywood is directed by Jesse Dylan who has experience in comedy after directing American Wedding. This is a nice family film to pass your time and laugh with your kids or even just all by yourself. And on a trivia note Jesse Dylan is the son of Bob Dylan.

The film tells the story of Phil (Will Ferrell)and how his father has pressured him all his life since he was a infant to be athletically capable person while having no talent at all. While he gets a family on his own his relationship with his father has not been going well when his father trades his son to a another soccer team The Tigers instead of keeping him in the one he coaches The Gladiators. As Phil gets mad about it. Situation brings it for Phil to coach his sons team. Being the worst team in the league with the players being a bunch of misfits,Phil has to take as his assistant coach Mike Ditka the Superbowl coach himself. He and Phil embark on a journey to take down Phil's dad for good. With very funny results in the outcome.

This film is made for kids and their families. This a funny film. Will Ferrell showing film after film that he is star to stay. A greatly talented comedian and SNL veteran is quite good in the film. He acts beside the great Robert Duvall in a very good manner and to the Football Hall A Famer Mike Ditka. Mike Ditka in his first acting part does a great job. He is serious and funny when he needs and great addition to the film. Film is well hearted with overall theme of father and father figures and trying win your fathers love and respect. Phil who never had a good relationship with his father is always trying to get his respect. Instead with Ditka he gives it automatically respect.

Also besides being a comedy and a family film. Its a sports film. Its soccer movie. The soccer in the film is pretty good. Its realistic and fun. Its not sloppy. A lot of films make the sports sections pretty sloppy and ruins the mood of the film. Like in the film the two Italian kids playing soccer. They look really cool makimg some amazing soccer moves. I mean this is no great sports film. But it's a better and a more serious film than some other films that don't take themselves seriously and lose the purpose of the film in the end. This film knows what it is about and what to show the audience a good time. So when there done with the film they can turn off the DVD with a smile.

The is a fun film and worth a look. Cool extras on the DVD like outtakes and behind the scenes makes this DVD a nice little package for the whole family. So watch and enjoy.",1134172800,,2606,4.2269076305220885
2386496,2,B000ADWDEI,"In Kicking and Screaming, Will Ferrell is again saddled with a sub-par script.  He has some great co-stars, namely Robert Duvall and Mike Ditka, who carries a great presence on the screen.  The premise revolves around a meek guy (Ferrell) and his cartoonishly competitive relationship with his own father (Duvall), who coaches his son's soccer team.  Gramps decides to trade his untalented grandson to another team - the worst in the league.  Through a series of wacky events, Ferrell becomes the coach of the rag tag team, a Bad News Bears knock-off with less charm and humor.  Other than Ferrell's screen son, the only other kid with much charisma is a pint size Asian boy whose character is named Byon Sun.  As a gag that seems to be meant to save the movie from itself, Ditka(who in the film is Duvall's neighbor band rival) becomes Ferrell's assistant coach.  Hilarity ensues, and the movie plods to its predictable conclusion.

Ditka's performance is actually the best thing to be seen here, with Ferrell trying hard but not getting many laughs.  The script caters more to 10-12 year olds than to adults.  Perhaps that is the point.  Final grade - D+",1133740800,2,1156,4.787878787878788
2386497,2,B000ADWDEI,"I looked forward to watching this film ever since I heard of the premise and that it would be starring Will Ferrell and Robert Duvall.  Although I ready some initial poor reviews, I thought, ""How could it miss?"".  Well, I hate to say it, but this film falls pretty flat.  It has a few funny moments, but not enough to justify spending 1 1/2 hours of your life on this film.

First of all, Robert Duvall plays his role perfectly.  He should have been the focus of the film.  I can't think of better casting than him for this role.  He is one of the finest actors of our time and he shows his versatility in this film.

The problem is the the writing and the character played by Will Farrell.  Instead of making him funny with a serious side, which would have drawn our interest, they make him absurd and ridiculous.  Although I like Will Ferrell, he has nothing to work with here.  Watching many of the ridiculous gags he had to endure, I turned away in embarassment for him, rather than laughing.  Think of the movie ""Parenthood"".  It had a lot of funny scenes, but it also had a serious side that made it real.  Steve Martin played a role in that film that would have fit perfectly into ""Kicking and Screaming"", but the writers chose to write Will Ferrells character like they based it on an ""Ernest goes to ..."" movie.

While Robert Duvall and Will Ferrell fans will be tempted to see this movie, I can't imagine many will think this is a good film.  Save your money for something better.",1133222400,,1490,4.363636363636363
2386505,3,B000ADWDEI,"The movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I could see where the jokes were but most of them weren't funny.

However, this is a decent family film. It reminded me of when I played little league soccer and how some dad's were just way to in it. Overall, I think everyone will find this movie quite funny but as for the story line it is very plain and simple and predictable.",1132358400,,404,4.328947368421052

Ferrell plays the not so jockish son of jock Robert Duvall, who finds himself drafted to coach his son's really bad soccer team.  Ferrell finds himself getting addicted to caffeine and lucks into two good players in Italian children who help their uncle in his butcher shop.  Former Chicago Bear Mike Ditka generates a few laughs playing himself, and the kids are appropriately cute.  It's all predictable and harmless fun the family can watch together.",1131321600,,621,4.9326923076923075
2386509,2,B000ADWDEI,"Let me say up front that I think Will Farrell is one of the five funniest humans currently walking the the face of the earth.  That said, based on his involvement with ""Kicking and Screaming"", he is also one of the five worst judges of movie scripts!

All right, maybe that's a little unfair to say, since he was in ""Old School"" and ""Anchorman"", which were both very funny movies. And I guess it's possible that at some point -- very, very early in its development period -- ""Kicking & Screaming"" might have shown enough promise to make him think it'd be a worthy successor to those bombastic comedies.

So what happened?  I suspect that, at a key juncture, the filmmakers decided to approach it as BOTH a G-rated kids' sports movie and an adult comedy.  As has happened with most such films before it (many helmed my directors more adept than Jesse Dylan), the result is an empty movie orphan which satisfies neither audience.

And it doesn't help that the film looks like it was directed by a 12-year-old -- with spare change, on a saturday afternoon -- who has never even WATCHED soccer before.

It's tough to call this a truly awful movie, because there are a few laughs scattered here and there, mostly because Ferrell is able to mine one or two golden nuggets from the mostly barren script.  But they are few and far between.  He has little help from the rest of the cast (aside from Mike Ditka), and the kids especially are a disappointment.  I expect more from executive producer Judd Apatow, who scored a slam dunk with his cast for the TV show ""Freaks and Geeks.""  I guess he used up all of his casting inspiration on that show, because this is perhaps the least memorable kid cast ever.

As you probably know by now, Ferrell plays Phil Weston, an over-his-head youth soccer coach saddled with a sad-sack team who feels inadequacy towards his father (Robert Duvall), also a coach, but more successful.  Hilarity is supposed to ensue from this premise, but doesn't.  Despite the use of every single tired sports-movie cliche in the book.

The main problem is that we never care about any of characters.  We never get any feel for the relationship between Ferrell and his kid, which should be pivotal because that's what gets him into coaching. The kids are broad stroked and typecast (the short shy kid, the big slow kid, the jokester, etc.) and never really figure into the story in any meaningful way.  And Mike Ditka is supposed to be Duvall's nemesis...but why?  Motivations are never explained.  The result is a very empty movie.

Director Jesse Dylan (son of Bob Dylan) brings nothing to the party and ineptly stages a series of pratfall-ridden music videos featuring the most used-to-death sports anthems -- Vangelis' theme from ""Chariots of Fire,"" Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" and Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger.""

And I'm no soccer expert per se, but I played for 13 years and can tell good-movie soccer from bad-movie soccer...and this is as bad as it gets!  I was shocked to learn that they had ""soccer advisors"" on-set.  I hope that's not your day job, guys, because this is some very shoddy stuff!

If you're looking for a good family sports movie, check out Dennis Quaid's ""The Rookie"" which came out a few years ago.  And that advice goes double for anybody associated with ""Kicking and Screaming"" who might be reading this!",1131321600,4,3348,4.67235494880546
2386510,5,B000ADWDEI,"10 years ago, we had the soccer film The Big Green, and now Soccer is back in the movies with Kicking & Screaming starring Well Ferrell, Robert Duvall & DA Coach. That of course is former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka which of course is playing himself in this film. Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is the son of sporting goods mini-magnate Buck (Robert Duvall), who is very competitive. His parents are dirvoced, and his Dad gets re-married to Janice Weston (Musetta Vander) right at the same time as he meets and falls in love with Barbara Weston (Kate Walsh) , and they have a son Sam Weston (Dylan McLaughlin), and at the same time, his dad aslo had another son (Josh Hutcherson). Now Phil's father coaches the Gladiators, and Phil's son plays for his grandpa. But then Phil learns that his own father traded Sam to the Tigers, now can he really do that? I guess he not only can, he did so even if they are a last place team, he tells his wife, and then it is up to who tells Sam, at first Phil tells him that he got him on a new team, but then he askes if he was traded. At his first game, which the Tigers have played thier first game of the new season, Phil learns that the coach of the team, has quit coaching the team, and moved to an unknown location. And no parents will step up, Phil decides the coach the team for one game, which he doesn't know the Tigers are playing his dad's team the Gladiators. And after the game ends, Phil decides to become thier new coach, and after a talk with his wife, he asks his dad's neighbor and who else but Mike Ditka.

2386511,3,B000ADWDEI,"Kicking and Screaming stars Will Ferrell as Phil Weston.  Phil has constantly lived under the overbearing influence of his dad, Buck, played by Robert Duvall.  Buck competes at everything and humiliates is son when he isn't successful in sports.  Phil ends up coaching his own soccer team in a league against his dad, and Phil must decide if sports is more important than family like his dad taught him, or is family really what matters.

This is a great movie to watch with the family because there is no swearing (except ""hell"" a few times) or sex or violence.  Although this movie is clean, it really isn't that good.  There are quite a few amusing moments, such as Mike Ditka as Phil's assistant coach, and the flashback to when Buck stole a soccer ball kicked into the stands from Phil.

Overall, the movie appears to lack direction.  The kids on the soccer team are showcased a bit, but Phil's son and the lack of attention from Phil is ignored until the end.  Also, Phil, for no reason gets hooked on coffee.  This is kind of funny but also comes out of nowhere and feels like it doesn't belong.

This movie is okay but also a great example of why movies are suffering at the box office.  I sure am glad I didn't pay $8 to see this at the theater.",1130803200,,1254,4.404347826086957

Of all the trailers I have seen, not one mentioned the gay/lesbian content in this movie.  I watched it with my children and found myself cringing when Will Farrell's character said that the lesbian soccer parents were ""better"" than the other soccer parents on the team!  This is not the kind of entertainment I want to bring into my home.  It may be suitable for some families but I find the studio's neglect to inform us of this same-sex relationship is a sneaky way to get this product into the homes of conservative parents.",1130198400,4,664,4.554621848739496
2386513,3,B000ADWDEI,"Kicking and Screaming is about the son of a man who's obsessed with being the best. Will Ferrell plays the son and Robert Duvall plays the dad. When Ferrell gets the chance to be soccer coach he takes it because his son needs a new coach. He soon finds out that the team is awful. So he brings in his dad's arch enemy and nextdoor neighbor to help him out. He just happens to be Mike Ditka. He helps the team improve but they still aren't winning. Ditka then comes up with idea to bring in two italian kids who work at a  family deli and who happen to be great at soccer. Their dad says that meat comes first but after a lot of begging he gives in and lets them play.

  They're so good that Ferrell just lets them do all the work and together they start winning. Besides winning going to Ferrell's head, Ditka gets him into drinking coffee to relax him. Ferrell soon gets horribly addicted to coffee though and turns into a mad man. Just like his dad benched him when he was little, he finds himself benching his own son.

  The movie is nutty and often pretty funny.  Mike Ditka is surprisingly very funny too and him and Ferrell have chemestry. While Duvall is entertaining as well as a mean old man. Ferrell can be overly cruel here though. It's more sad than funny when a grown-man is calling kids names and pushing them hard to the ground. Just like when Adam Sandler beat the crap out of little kids with dodge balls in Billy Madison. If that doesn't bother you, you should like the movie. Ferrell is about as loud and off the wall as he was in Old School. So if you liked him as Frank the Tank, then you should like Frank the Tank Coaches Soccer.

2386514,3,B000ADWDEI,"To say that ""Kicking And Screaming"" is a charming, feel-good comedy that will teach your kids the meaning of sportsmanship would be similar to calling ""Scarface"" an instructional video for starting one's own business.  (Wait a minute...)  A more accurate analogy would be closer to ""Bad News Bears"" on a soccer pitch; right down to the big kid with the AC/DC T-shirt.

Here's the gist:  Saturday Night Live alum Will Ferrell stars as Phil Weston, a middle-aged vitamin salesman who reluctantly agrees to coach his son's soccer team when the original coach goes missing.  While at first merely a good deed for the day, the gesture soon presents an opportunity to finally one-up his disturbingly overcompetitive dad, Buck (Robert Duvall), who coaches a rival team.  With the help of Buck's neighbor Mike Ditka (yes, you read that right), a pair of Italian juvenile ringers, and several gallons of coffee (you'll just have to see for yourself how that makes sense), Watson's Tigers make it to the championship game, where they showdown with Buck's Gladiators.
Like ""Bad News Bears"", soccer moms and dads looking for a moral to this story will be disappointed.  If anything, though, ""Screaming"" does okay as a jab to the whole youth soccer phenomenon.  Emotionally, the film's like Space Mountain; you'll chuckle, your eyes will widen in disbelief, you'll shake your head, and you'll be thankful the whole thing wasn't longer, all in a span of 90 or so minutes.  Phil's java-induced transformation from oversensitive parent to psychobabbling, child-scaring tyrant provides for most if not all of the aforementioned reactions; it's cute at first, but as the movie progresses, it just gets old.  It does have its share of funny, though; the tetherball game between Phil and his dad is particularly snort-worthy, as are Ditka's interactions with just about everyone in the cast.  The comedy is offset a little by a couple of out-of-place quirks; most notably the whole thing with Buck's other son.  That little attempted plot twist could've added more to the story, but only serves to add a pinch of unnecessary weird.
The cast is supported rather nicely by a menagerie of sketch comedy veterans:  Dave Herman (Mad TV, Office Space) plays a folically-challenged, stressed-out referee; Laura Kightlinger and Rachel Harris (The Daily Show, I Love the 80s) complement each other as a lesbian couple whose adopted Asian son plays for Phil's team; and Alex Borstein (Mad TV's ""Ms. Swan"") turns in a cameo with her black Hummer (in a darned funny, fist-raising moment for SUV owners everywhere).

All told, this comedy doesn't score a goal for the genre, but it does ring off  the figurative crossbar.  Will Ferrell indeed proves his genius once again; while not his best or most hilarious performance, it is still gold, and lifts the film above average in a few places.  If you're a big fan of Ferrell (or Ditka, for that matter), you'll welcome this into your collection.  Otherwise, by movie's end you may find yourself wondering why you clicked it into your shopping cart.  Bonus features include some great outtakes (mostly with Mike Ditka...what a ham), a few deleted scenes, and a ""making-of"" featurette.",1129766400,,3198,5.0227272727272725

The coffee jokes were great!  I think Will's such a fantastic comedic actor and I miss him on SNL...

2386518,3,B000ADWDEI,"Nice guy Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) has never been able to live up to the expectations of his ultra-competitive sports stud father Buck (Robert Duvall). The apples don't fall far from the tree when both father and son have boys the same age: Phil's son Sam (Dylan McLaughlin) is a thoughtful unathletic child, while Buck's son Bucky (Josh Hutcherson) is driven to win like his father. When Phil ends up coaching Sam's last-place soccer team the Tigers in the same league as Buck and Bucky's team, the Gladiators, the father/son competition is on as never before. And who better to challenge Buck's team than his equally competitive neighbor, football Hall of Famer Coach Mike Ditka?

According the its writers Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick, ""Kicking and Screaming"" was inspired by the ubiquity of children's soccer clubs in the United States these days and the parents who take the game too seriously. That's certainly fertile ground for comedy. Where I live, those parents are unaffectionately referred to as the ""soccer mafia"" for their relentless and sometimes underhanded crusades to turn every square inch of parkland into a soccer field. It's already satire; no writers required. But ""Kicking and Screaming"" does little to exploit that angle. This is a one-joke film, and that joke is a couple of grown men acting out a lifelong rivalry through a bunch of kids. The kids are cute and quirky. Young soccer phenoms Francesco Liotti and Alessandro Ruggiero are impressive as the film's Italian kids Gian Piero and Massimo. But the interminable father-son rivalry wears thin. I was left with the feeling that there is about an hour's worth of material in this hour-and-a-half film. It gets dull fast.

The DVD (Universal 2005): Bonus features include 11 deleted scenes, outtakes (8  minutes), 3 alternate takes (5  minutes), and 3 featurettes. ""Soccer Camp"" (7  minutes) is about the 2 weeks of soccer camp that the young actors went through under the tutelage of soccer choreographer Dan Metcalfe. Includes interviews with the kids.

2386520,1,B000ADWDEI,When will people learn that Will Ferell is just bad at acting and almost all his movies are bad except Elf which was one of the funniest x-mas movies ever. The story is really stupid and predictable. The jokes are old and Will Ferell's humor is old. The movie is more of a kids film then for adults. This movie has been done lots in hollywood for example Little Giants which was way better. Overall bad really bad thank god I seen the movie for free one of the worse of the year.,1128816000,3,479,4.161290322580645
2386521,4,B000ADWDEI,"Kicking and Screaming as a good movie (better than Ferrell's Bewitched) Ferrell was fun, but not great. It was though a good attempt by Ferrell and a good 100 minutes of fun.",1125014400,,174,4.46875
2386522,3,B000ADWDEI,"Kicking and Screaming advertises itself as a silly kids movie and that is exactly what it is.  It would be very hard for adults (except for exceptionally childish adults) to actually enjoy this movie.  I'm sorry, but Will Ferrel is just too over-the-top and unrealistic and the only scenes that are good are the ones where he doesn't dominate them.

But the nice and enjoyable thing is that while it advertises itself as a kid's movie, it stays true to this without trying to add in scenes for the adults.  That's right, no scatily clad women or anything that would make me nervous to have my son watch.  There was also no foul language.  The only thing that would have me concerned was that there were two women with have chosen to live an alternative lifestyle but the movie does a decent job of hiding this from the kidies.  At least they hid it enough to not spark the interest of my inquisitive 8-year-old.

But this isn't a movie to spend a lot of money on.  I took my family to the cheap theater and spent about as much money as a rental would cost.  I would suggest one of these, I wouldn't find it worth spending any more money on.",1121644800,2,1140,4.360189573459715
2386523,3,B000ADWDEI,"Will Farrel plays a father to a ten year old in this film. Will's father has bullied his son all his life especially when it comes to playing soccer. Will as a kid would sit out games as a ""benchwarmer"" (interesting term used  a lot in the film) despite his father coaching his side. Will's son ""sam"" finds himself in the same predicament. Sam's grand father is still coach and a mean one at that. Will Farrel can't see his father bully his poor kid and coaches a team on his own. The story builds on from them. I thought the Mike Dicta's character was pretty funny actually.

There are some very funny situations shown in the movie and eventually I liked it more than I thought I would. It lingers on and ends in a predictable end. I thought the kids that made up ""Tigers"" did a great job. I laughed my head of in the scenes where the Gladiators defeat Tigers 13-0. There's something about incompetence and fear that just tickles me like mad. Watch it to know for yourself.

There's also a very strange but very funny depiction of Coffee in this movie. There's a Japanese kid around 3 feet in height that was very funny and cute. Overdramatic,cheesy but funnier than most.

2386524,4,B000ADWDEI,"""Kicking & Screaming"" is a great, funny, and rather adult movie for the first half hour. After that, the movie kind of takes a turn, not for the worst, but for a lesser variation on what it was. The opening title sequence chronicling Ferrell's sports follies is hilarious, and it sets a good pace for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, the movie does not create those kind of laughs for the rest of the movie. Truth be told, Will Ferrell makes this movie watchable. Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Ray Romano could not have done the same thing Ferrell has done here. His adlibs carry most of the movie, as the characters around him go by the script and are not nearly as funny. Most of the scenes with Ferrell and Mike Ditka work because they try so hard to make it funny that it actually works. In my opinion, even though this is a pretty good movie, Will Ferrell was much better in his more adult movies like ""Old School"", ""Zoolander"", ""Anchorman"", ""Starsky And Hutch"", ""Superstar, the first two ""Austin Powers"" movies, and the more somber ""Melinda And Melinda"". Even 2003's kid-aimed Christmas movie ""Elf"" was hilarious, and is one of my Christmas favorites.  ""Anchorman"" is very clever and so is ""Old School"", but those two movies show just how funny Ferrell can be when he want to be. He doesn't need to tame himself for movies like this when he would have been perfectly fine doing the remake of ""The Longest Yard"" (he would probably be funnier than Adam Sandler).  It seems almost as if he has tamed himself for this role, something he could have easily avoided. The movie is going to bore most kids ages 3-10, mostly because of the long stretches of just talking in the middle. So, if your adlibbing alot of your lines, and the director has only directed R rated movies in the past, why not bump the rating up to a PG-13 and throw in a few sex and drug references and maybe an f-word, or something. People in the general audience tend to discriminate against movies that are marketed for a long time as one of those ""Not Yet Rated"" movies, and then it turns out that its rated PG. Movies like ""National Treasure"", which had previews running in late July, was unrated until early November, the same month it was released. ""Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"" began its long marketing career in December was finally rated in March. Both those movies were very good, and there were alot of people that didn't see them because of the PG rating. ""Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"" was first previewed to me (I don't know about the other people) when I went to see ""Troy"". I first found out the rating the week before it came out in September. It was supposed to be released in the summer, but it was delayed probably because of editing. That movie was only OK, but it goes to show what a PG movie can be. This is different. It was rated almost immediately, and it drew a large audience on opening weekend. But people, I can not stress enough that this is about as much a kids movie as ""Meet The Focker's"". It is geared more towards adults, like ""Finding Neverland"", but because of the rating people think that it's appropriate for kids. Will Ferrell is the only movies that this movie is watchable most of the time. Without him, the movie is as kiddie-fare as they come.

Will Ferrell plays Phil Weston, owner of a vitamin store and father of ten year old Sam Weston (Dylan McLaughlin). His father, Buck Weston (Robert Duvall), has always been highly competitive. From sticking a soccer ball in Phil's cradle as a child to playing him in a tetherball tournament as an adult, he has always wanted to win. Sam plays on the Gladdiators, Buck's soccer team. Buck always keeps Sam on the bench throughout the entire game, and finally, when Phil confronts him about this, Buck informshim that he has traded Sam to the Tigers. Think of them as the ""special"" soccer team. When the coach drops out because the kids drove him crazy one game into the season, Phil must take over or dissapoint Sam and the entire rest of the team by forfitting the entire season. After several humiliating losses, mostly to Buck's team, Phil makes the executive decision and arranges some intense practices. These scenes are not that funny, but they really should be. One kid eats worms. Ha-ha! Another pretends to be pregnant by shoving a soccer ball up his shirt and yelling ""It's about to come out!"". That's the highlight of the entire sequence. Oh lord. Other moments in the movie just are not funny because they try too hard. The entire last act with ""The Italians""is just an excercise in seeing how far and how funny one joke can be. It's the equivalent of seeing how many tricks a one trick pony can do. Phil eventually gets obsessed, almost dangerously, in the game. Big suprise, the kids stop having fun. Sam quits the team, and Phil starts going a little Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction"" with the look of the team. He makes himself a costume, blue with black tiger stripes, and starts to coach the kids with that. For some reason I don't think they took him very seriously, or will ever take him very seriously. He looks like a pimp. Sans the cane and fuzzy purple hat. Phil enlists the help of Mike Ditka (playing himself here), who is his fathers arch enemy. Phil's team begins to get better, and soon they begin to win. This is when Phil gets too cocky for his. . .britches? No! Too cocky for his pimp costume.

Soon, late into the third act, in the last 45 minutes, the movie picks up pace again and begins to get funnier. Of course, like there is with every kid movie, the coach teaches a valuable life lesson to all his kids. This happened in the terrible ""Hoosiers"", and most recently in the well done but mortally flawed ""Friday Night Lights"". Only this movie does it in a more stylized way, and when it is over we realize what has happened, It never comes to our mind that the coach is preaching when he is actually doing the act. Like all other sports movies, the kids come together to help one another. The outcasts, the shy kids, and the too-cool-for-school kids. Again, this happened in ""Hoosiers"" with everyone trying to get that Jimmy kid on the team, and so Gene Hackman. . .that was the ""French Connection"", sorry. In ""Friday Night Lights"", all the team mates tried to help Boobie Miles to get off his major ego trip (it doesn't help because they end up losing). Seriously, though. Who names there kid Boobie? They are just asking for trouble with that one. Why not Bobby? Billy. I could think of a million better names that Boobie (and it really did not help his character in that movie when in the middle he started blingin' it out). I'm sorry, but this movie, although very funny and clever in parts, is just another predictable kid movie that will appeal to several adults. Ferrell was much funnier as Frank The Tank in ""Old School"", and he was a riot as the chauvanistic Ron Burgandy in the guilty pleasure ""Anchorman"". This is the kind of movie that will provide many laughs on family pizza night, just make sure you have several glasses of soda first. If you really like Will Ferrell, like me, catch this in theaters and you probably will not be terribly dissapointed. I know I wasn't. If you don't really like him, skip this and take the kids to ""Madagascar"", and if you're geeky like that ""Star Wars"" for the fourty-eighth time. This is more the kind of movie Ferrell should have done during his SNL hiatus, not as a fully developed movie star. I secretly kept hoping he would strip down and streak across the soccer field. Will, here my plea: Go back to R and PG-13 movies, not these kind of kids movies. I hope there will be a directors cut when released on DVD.

Rated PG for Language and Sexual Innuendo.",1117411200,4,7736,4.5149786019971465
2386525,4,B000ADWDEI,"Phil Weston (Farrell) has never lived up to his dad, Buck's (Duvall), expectations.  Buck is a man's man, big on toughness.  When he trades his own grandson from the soccer team he coaches, Phil is mad.  He sees his son being treated like he was as a child.

Circumstances put Phil in the position of coaching his son's new team.  They are really bad, and Phil recruits the help of his dad's neighbor and arch-nemesis, Mike Ditka (gleefully playing a caracature of himself).  The get a couple of ringers (kids of the local Italian butcher), and soon find themselves on the winning track.  Of course, before the season ends, they will cross paths with Buck's team, and that will be Phil's chance to prove himself once and for all.

""Kicking & Screaming"" is a good, funny family movie.  Farrell, having long since proven he has escaped the SNL curse, is great and believeable as the sone who just wants his dad to be proud of him.  Duvall also shines as the tough as nails dad.  Mike Ditka also gives a great performance in a role that pokes some fun at himself.  Plot-wise, there is nothing new here.  Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable and funny film, and I recommend it.",1116547200,10,1170,4.54066985645933
2386526,4,B000ADWDEI,"I was originally worried that this movie would be a little ""corny"" for its PG rating. But, boy was I wrong! This film was funny from start to finish. Will Ferrell is equally talented at family humor and R-rated humor. For an actor to make me laugh that much at both is very acceptable in my book.

But the real treasure of this film lies with Mike Ditka. Do not underestimate him! He is the funniest thing of the movie. Its like he's playing himself in real life by seeing the way he coaches the kids. I must say there is just something funny about guys yelling at kids. Great comedy for the start of the summer movie season!",1116460800,,625,4.2521008403361344
2386527,3,B000ADWDEI,"This isn't exactly a great movie, but it pretty much delivers what the trailer's promise.  Will Ferrell plays a mild-mannered dad who volunteers to coach his son's soccer team (because no one else will) and he evolves from a milquetoast into a raving maniac, encouraging his young misfits to maim and mutilate the opponents.  He learns valuable lessons by the end, and everything works out more or less like all sports / kids movies.

There are some good laughs to be had.  A trip to a butcher shop is quite memorable.  Some of the kids are fun.  There is a lesbian couple who have adopted a very small Oriental child.  They inform the coach that their son is ""shy"" and even give Ferrell a book called ""My Child is Shy"" to read over.  Turns out the kid is NOT shy...but his parents are oblivious...their kid MUST be shy!!  That's a pretty subtle joke for such an unsubtle film.

Ferrell's motivations center around his strained relationship with his dad (Robert  Duval, coasting and cashing in a good paycheck), a super-driven alpha-male coach who revels in trashing the athletic (and non-athletic) accomplishments and efforts of his oldest son.  (Duvall has a young son from his second, young wife...the kid is the same age as Ferrell's boy, and that's kinda a funny premise...and an excuse for Duval to be a coach).

Mike Ditka plays himself in the movie, and he's in a lot of it.  Ditka is not bad at all, but there's something about this real life person being a character in a farcical fiction that begins to become a bit silly.  He's too much of a good thing...although he's the person who introduces Ferrell to coffee...the ""drug"" that causes much of Ferrell's personality change.

Is the movie worth seeing?  I say ""yes,"" because of Will Ferrell.  The man is adept at playing an ordinary, likeable, plain-looking guy who is right on the edge of totally losing his cool, his sanity and his dignity.  It's the kind of part that Eddie Murphy plays in stuff like DADDY DAY CARE or like Steve Martin in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN.  But whereas those two fine actors play nice people through and through...even when flustered they are nice, Ferrell plays a nice guy with the ability to become decidedly NOT NICE!  He has an edge, a glimmer of desperation that elevates the film a little above the ordinary.  I believe it's this edge that even makes him interesting in stuff like ELF.  There's something about him that's just not quite ""right.""  I believe that someday, if Ferrell cares to try, he would be quite capable of tackling a serious role and giving a convincing performance.  Not a romantic lead, maybe, but maybe a troubled man (a la Tim Robbins in MYSTIC RIVER) or even something like Adam Sandler tried in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.

Anyway, as far as KICKING AND SCREAMING goes, I would recommend checking it out, and I think it's okay for kids age 11 or older.  It's funny and not challenging.",1116288000,,2894,4.645669291338582
2386528,3,B000ADWDEI,I think (like many reviewers had mentioned) I had too high expectations.  I think I was looking for a goofy family movie like Elf and although this movie is funny it is not hilarious.  I too had thought the kids would have helped this movie out.  They were funny in the parts they were given.  The coffee scenes started to become annoying after too many of them and the whole fighting with the father/son also got annoying as it tended to be the same scenes over again.  I felt the soccer parts of the movie are what kept this movie afloat.  Those kids had talent not only in soccer but in comedy.  I feel with a better script and less time taken up then this movie would have shined.  I also noticed it was quite a long movie.  My philosophy is when you know a movie is long and you can remember what you would want changed more than the parts that were funny then this movie was not well made.  I would definitely hold off to watch this one until video.,1116201600,,955,4.197802197802198
2386529,4,B000ADWDEI,"I went to see this movie expecting a lot, maybe too much.  ""Kicking and Screaming"" is not a bad movie.  But I think it could have been a great movie with a little more thought put into the script.  As much as I like Will Ferrell, I think this is a movie that should have focused a little more attention on the kids in the film.  I don't mean that the film should have left anything out concerning the mental battle between Ferrell (Phil) and Robert Duvall (Buck, Phil's dad).  But the film could have used a boost from the young actors in the film; they all seemed very talented - it made the viewer want to see more involvement by their characters.

  I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I won't go into too much detail as I explain how this movie could have been a little better (and also point out what was right about the film):

#1.  Anyone who has ever coached, has at one time or another felt like they were in over their heads.  Phil's

first day coaching (young kids) was a good example of the shock one gets.

#2.  The soccer players were a little too tame in this movie.  The Tigers needed to show a little more street-savvy in my opinion.  The script had them acting like they were trying out for the ""Leave It to Beaver"" pilot.

#3.  The Italian brothers (at least I think they were brothers) should have had more speaking roles.  Maybe having one of the other kids constantly trying to teach them English, but not having much luck.  It was missed opportunities like this that made the script appear weak and hurried.  The writers created these amazing characters and then didn't use them.

#4.  Phil's addiction to coffee was hilarious and added a nice side-story to the movie.

#5.  I would have shot for little more realism with this film.  The entire movie had a ""it's a movie - we don't have to make it seem like it could really happen"" feeling to it.  That always upsets me.  I believe movies can be funny without throwing out the realism.

#6.  Phil's son needed to have a lot more screen time.  Ya barely saw the kid!

#7.  And finally, I think the movie could have used a girl on the soccer team.  It just doesn't seem like a made for kids movie with no girl on the team.  Maybe she could have taught the Italians English?  Seeing how the boys were too busy eating worms or stealing the Ref's toupee.

See ya next review!",1116201600,4,2354,4.292237442922374
2386530,3,B000ADWDEI,"This weekend at the box office is an example of a period simply known as the scramble weekend for the major movie studios, with the only exception in this case being 20th Century Fox of course. But what does it mean exactly? It is the weekend where the studios dump the best, or in certain cases the worst, they have with production budgets in the $40-50 million range that are meant to zap any remaining dollars left in the pockets of patrons before the release of what could quite possibly be the biggest blockbuster hit of the year, which this year would be the final installment in the Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith. The purpose of this weekend is also to allow studio executives to save face. If the picture turns out to be horrendously awful and takes a dive in its sophomore weekend at the box office, the failure can easily be attributed to the blockbuster release. And in a year which has already demonstrated several times over to be a foreseeable disaster for the box office, studio executives only wish these came along more often.

The story for Kicking and Screaming is lacking at best, intellectually demeaning at worst. Removing the Will Ferrell element from the picture and you basically have the run of the mill family sports film straight off the conveyer belt of the Hollywood clich machine. Can no one remember the Walt Disney Company doing the same thing a few years ago with some film called The Big Green? More people should because at the very least that was twice as entertaining as this was. This does not necessarily mean however that the entire film is a complete and utter disaster. Ferrell manages to get off a few laughs sporadically and the performances from the children are cute and entertaining though not excessively annoying, which is always a plus.

Will Ferrell is quite possibly the only true draw for audience members, unless you happen to be an extremely dedicated Chicago Bears fan (in which case you ought to consider getting another hobby), so it is only appropriate then that he be the center of attention in the movie. It just seems ironic that in a film which preaches the concept of teamwork and everyone having their own ""special"" talent to contribute down the throat of its audience, the actions of the performers dictate in the exact opposite direction. Ferrell's eccentric high-jinks come off as being more and more desperate in their appeal for laughs as the picture progresses, reaching the point in which it becomes more saddening to watch then hysterical. Half of the material works while the other half falls apart entirely and is just plain embarrassing, whether for him as a performer or us as paying customers is a matter of one's own opinion. Duvall is moderate in the role of Phil's overly competitive father, Buck Weston, but honestly is this the sort of demeaning roles we are to expect from such a dedicated and talented performer as him? No, but why does he continually choose these projects? Please, Mr. Duvall, do not follow in the footsteps of Robert De Niro! The casting director, the screenwriter, or whoever it was that hired him must have been a die-hard Bears fan to have had the brilliant idea of having Mike Ditka star opposite funnyman Will Ferrell in this film because there certainly is no sign in his performance as though he was exceptionally eager to do this film in the first place. Here is the true quandary that is the Ditka dilemma: On the one hand, if the reviews pan his performance enough then perhaps audiences will no longer have to entire his sub-par acting abilities in films any more. On the other hand though, we would be forced then to see him hawking Cialis products during the football season. Honestly, where is the lesser of two evils in that situation? And in spite of the belief the filmmakers attempt to project onto its audience, this is hardly a father/son picture especially when the son, portrayed by Dylan McLaughlin, accumulates less then ten minutes of screen time, if that much, in a hour and a half film.

Overall, Kicking and Screaming truly devotes itself to its message of `just having fun' and not letting the competition ruin the experience of the game, which sadly results it a rather mediocre film and an even worse example for children. Everyone can agree to the idea that they want their children to have fun athletic sports such as soccer but what makes these activities what they are is that they are distinctly competitive in nature. That is the entire point. Thankfully the film does not divulge into the `Communist soccer' concept, in which no one loses and everyone is a `winner', but it comes pretty damn close though. The real world is not as clean-cut as some parents would have their children growing up to believe and therefore these competitive recreational sports can come quite in handy in building up their self-esteem and help them in the future. True, there are definitely those parents who go seriously overboard in pushing their children deeper into the mix then they would care to go. But as long as the child continues to have fun with the sport and it interferes with neither his education nor his social life then there should be no problem with it. Kicking and Screaming advertises itself as a family film and yet there are numerous jokes aimed at adults that are quite simply not appropriate for younger children, particularly the whole gag involving the lesbian couple and their supposedly `shy' Asian child. In addition to that, is it not defeating the message of the film when the losers, in this case The Tigers, win in the championship final game? When your claim is that winning isn't everything, what sense does it make to have them not learning the `value' of losing? Kicking and Screaming, in spite of Ferrell's best efforts, which quite frankly turn out to be his worst on film, is yet another picture on the lengthy list of mediocre comedies this year, one which shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.",1116115200,,5973,4.724832214765101
2386531,3,B000ADWDEI,"Robert Duvall is absolutely fabulous - what a surprise to see him in this movie.  Will Farrell is terrific too.  There are a few items for the adults as well (coffee adiction). It did drag on a little - could have cut 15-20 minutes off.

My only complaint, and this may be specific to my movie theater, is that they showed a comercial for the WB show, ""One Tree Hill"" and it had a very sexual suggestive scene (two teens in what looked like a locker room shower - boy and girl).  Most of the people in my theater were kids between 5 and 10 (from a quick glance).  I heard a few adults gasp so I know I am not alone in my concerns.  Most people expected a light hearted soccer movie.  Just a heads up as you might want to be a little late to the theater.
