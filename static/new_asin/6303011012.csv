533184,5,6303011012,"I think Yanni has envisaged this album for all kinds of people. The scores chosen are really excellent and appropriate. All the artists are given equal chance to exhibit their skills. Especially the violinist - Wow!
Santorini is a real grandeur. The music just flows. I just recalled the moment I heard Yanni for the first time - it was Santorini. I was so thrilled to see Yanni playing it and I was not disappointed. It is a double-feast for I could feel not only the music but also the beauiful scenes of the structures from Acropolis appropriately picturized for the song. But unfortunately, this feast ends here itself.
Keys to imagination, Within Attractions and One man's dream are fantastic. Aria is another masterpiece. Felista is a nice song for his mother. The End of August is to end the nice evening with a style.
I think Yanni has given his best for this album - as he says. But I found two things missing in the DVD version: the sound effects are not all that good when compared to the CD version. The visual effects, especially lighting in most of the times, jazzy.
Indeed a great experience. I felt, sometimes, as if I were in Greece.",970012800,23,1150,4.5603864734299515
533185,5,6303011012,"This is a great video. It is probably the best concert I have ever seen. Yanni is magnificent. Also. Ms. Briggs is an accomplished violinist. If you are going to own just one concert in your video library, this is the one to  have.",952387200,5,231,4.25
533186,4,6303011012,"I sure would like to see whether a DVD version with more special features (e.g., the TV interview with The Woman in the Red Dress [you GO, Girlfriend!]).Since I R&D and design home theaters, I have carefully  calibrated equipment and a visually and acoustically tweaked studio. VERDICT  1:  THE PERFORMANCE IS A FIRESTORM AND A ""MUST SEE"" VIDEO!Merely  energetic isn't the word here; in my view Track 7 on the ACROPOLIS CD,  ""Within Attraction"" is the bomb!  The dueling violins were  masterful  and-one-of-a-kind. VERDICT 2:  THE AUDIO RATES ONLY 4 STARS.The  engineering was probably competent and digital, so a re-issue on HDCD or of  TelArc's 20-bit  surround quality is possible now.  But a DVD gives you the  whole enchilada.  CD audio is superior to DVD in some ways due to the  format--even played back in Dolby 5.1 Digital. VERDICT 3:  THE VIDEO  ENGINEERING IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED.On a direct view Sony 36"" XBR Wega  professionally calibrated to NTSC standards by ISF-certified tech, the VHS  edition had far too much ""red push"" (this may be a bad  tape-to-firm transfer) but as of 1994, videorecording digitally has been  available; I cannot believe that Yanni didn't have the concert thus  recorded. Therefore, I would like to see a digitally-corrected DVD from the  master. If he did not record video digitally, we're out-of-luck and those  ""blooming"" red PAR lights in the arena will never get cured  absent playback on high end professional gear. BOTTOM LINE: ****Yanni fans  need to ask the powers-that-be at PRIVATE MUSIC, 9014 Melrose Avenue,Los  Angeles, CA  90069, to come up with a remastered re-issue of this VHS  linear-track-audioperformance.  I'll do my part, as I am only 1/2 hour away  by freeway.  But a little help from Yanni fans would be very useful . .  .John Bartok Bastian, CEOFEAR NOT ENTERPRISES N.A.",940032000,12,1833,5.0

I did not purchase the DVD, due to the many complaints of bad video and audio quality.  If you live near Modesto, CA, Yanni is having a 25th anniversary of the Acropolis concert, next year, on tour.

I watched Live at the Acropolis when it first came on PBS. Thru these many years and performances Yanni has neve failed to disappoint. I ordered this DVD Live at the Acropolis to have for a Greek Night with Yanni with some friends. We had been out on my boat and I played the CD. One song Aria is so uplifting and etheral. I tried to explain how the two singers looked whilst performing it...that's what started our plans for Greek Night with Yanni. The DVD came in the mail in a timely manner.(It was all that I remembered that first night while watching it on PBS). I could not have been happier that night, eating Greek food, drinking Retsina wine, and sharing this DVD Live at the Acropolis with my friends.",1438732800,2,889,4.2976190476190474

533956,5,6303011012,"In my mind, this was the high point in Yanni's career. When the DVD first begins with the first selection and the French horns and orchestra announce their triumphant theme, you can see and feel the excitement, emotion, and elation Yanni must have felt when it all was finally ""for real"" and live. It can really move me.  No other DVD he did has affected me so. My only complaint is that it is NOT HD....looks more like VHS. Too bad! It really is a timeless piece -merited HD quality- and Yanni is a great artist. But the sound is clear and hifi. I have many of his CDs in my listening mix in my ""New Age"" genre.....",1407801600,5,616,4.220338983050848

This combination of both upbeat and mellow instrumentals is fantastic!  BALANCED is the word I would use:  Yanni's intricate solos are also balanced with amazing orchestration.  Featuring his other musical ""stars"" gives a delightful look at others who excel at their art.  The light changes enhance the program.  Most of all, Yanni's own commentary about his mother, his birth country, his joy at performing in Greece, and how he began his playing, are little tidbits, sprinkled briefly throughout the concert.",1402531200,,657,4.8558558558558556

534101,5,6303011012,"One of the top 5 most beautiful sites at which Yanni has performed. Being able to see as well as hear his music with a full orchestra playing live in this location at this time is a ""must"" for fans and collectors. I remember seeing it on PBS and had video taped it, but the DVD is always better than a hand taped one because there are no interruptions, no pleas for money. You pay for the DVD and you get so much more than you pay for. Yanni's mother and his wife at that time, are seen clearly and he talks about the roots of one of his songs coming from a lullaby his mother used to sing to him. Some awesome solo and duet performances within the concert as well. If I had believed Yanni had delivered everything he had to offer before seeing this, I would have missed a pivotal moment in this artist's maturing. The last DVD of his that I was this astounded and moved by was 'Yanni! The Live Event'. He has truly matured greatly and I believe this was his first step in that maturation.",1393459200,,989,4.15625

After watching it I felt that it wasn't an overpriced item. I was simply amazed at the talented artist, namely violinist Karen Briggs. I started looking for other concerts and came across this one, Acropolis. It is also amazing and Karen Briggs does not disappoint! Of the two I have to say that Tribute is my favorite.

And Charlie Adams the drummer... incredible!  On the song ""Aria"" we have two of the finest singers ever.  Full range of vocals with so much power.  Wonderful.

I continue to be amazed everyone does not do this, or the ""home entertainment center"" route.
Looking @ Wikipedia, they rated this video as the #2 all-time best seller behind a Michael Jackson work.

I subsequently got a Yanni music video ""Tribute"" filmed at the Forbidden City, China, and the Taj Mahal.
Same basic generation of performances, while slightly newer.
Then a fairly current ""Yanni live at El Morro, Puerto Rico.""

534311,5,6303011012,"Some of Yanni's most stirring music performed in one the most magnificent settings in the world - the ancient Acropolis of Athens in Greece.  This show is best viewed in a darkened room as the perfection of the evening seems to emanate from the screen.  It's not hard to imagine yourself sitting among the audience, especially with an adequate (or better) sound system to convey the music.

The orchestration and featured individual performances give the songs a majestic quality often lost on regular CD releases.  A good example is the rendition of 'Aria'.  Although this is a very good number in its original composition from the ""Dare to Dream"" album, the concert version adds horn flourishes and additional orchestration that elevates it to one of the best pieces in a lineup of extraordinary music.

While this music is eminently enjoyable listening to the audio alone, the addition of video will take your enjoyment of it to the next level.  If you are a Yanni fan of any degree, this DVD, as well as the Tribute concert DVD (which is even better in some ways), is an essential addition to your collection.",1367712000,2,1113,4.795811518324608

534468,5,6303011012,"I remember seeing this fantastic production when it was first aired here in the US back in the 90's. The music and presentation were absolutely first class with the most impressive part being the way the composer and musicians were able to project their hearts and souls within the music itself. I ran out to purchase the VHS version as soon as it became available.  I'm happy to have it on DVD now as my VHS was pretty worn out.  Just be aware that there is another version of this concert BUT IT IS MISSING several of the selections contained on this DVD.

I also wanted to say that it's unfortunate that one reviewer was so distracted by Yanni ""swooning and jerking"" that he gave the music and performance low marks, but then that reviewer probably has no idea what it feels like to have the power and beauty of the music engulfing you and flowing through you, especially as you perform your own creations before an audience and feel that indefinable bond between you and them as you see their expressions and know that your music is touching the hearts and souls of so many. Speaking from experience, it is the music itself that fills you, flows through you and moves you, and if you're not repressed, you may be moved to show your feelings as you perform. You really can get lost in the music itself.  Heck you see that type of ""swooning and jerking"" in the performances of  lots of musicians from all genres of music whether rock and roll, hip-hop, country-western, New Age or whatever. They are simply moved by the music and their art.

In any case, this is the best DVD version of this concert I've found and it has all the pieces that were in the broadcast.  There's another version of the DVD that's available with the CD but it does NOT have all the selections this version does.

534518,5,6303011012,"This concert was so successful that it led to several more in the next decade. There is a big different between Yanni's work with his small group and when he performs with a big orchestra, and this was the first evidence of that. I've watched this DVD (earlier, the VHS tape) now for 15 years and it's still some of the best music I've ever heard - and seen. I never get tired of listening or seeing it.  The colors from the purples, reds, yellows, etc that change all the time on the historic Acropolis site are beautiful, almost as beautiful as the music emanating from the musicians.

You can always tell Yanni's personal musicians from the rest of the orchestra: they are dressed a bit different and all have the long hair! The most visible and electric of them all is violinist Karen Briggs, who just astounds with her playing. She and drummer Charlie Adams really ham it up on occasion, but that's part of the fun. Enjoyable, too, are the solos by bassist Rick Federrici and pianist Julie Homi, whose cat-like looks mesmerize me.  Of the above-mentioned musicians, I think only Adams remains with the orchestra.

There is not a bad song in the bunch in this incredible concert. I hate to sound clich-like, but this music is so good, so classy, it will endure for a long, long time. Music like this never goes out of style.",1246233600,,1328,4.520833333333333

""Live at the Acropolis"" is very good listening, but quite different; and therefore, difficult to compare.  On its own, I would say it is very good music. It depend on one's taste, and/or mood. One thing I very much appreciate about these two albumns is that there is nothing on them that I feel a need to skip. Live at the Acropolis is a bit more subdued;the music is excellent. I especially enjoy the violins, subtle humor, and good will.

534556,4,6303011012,"Our enjoyment of music is based on many things: a mood, a feeling , a remembrance. I am not a real fan of New Age music but this concert has always interested me. I first saw it on VHS right after it came out and while not real thrilled thought it had potential.

I was reintroduced to the show when it was released on DVD. A friend said that I had to experience it and so I watched it one night and was more impressed than I had been on that night 15 years ago when I first saw it. Time changes us I guess I'm more open to this type of music than I was then.

Performed at the Herod Atticus Theatre at the foot of the Acropolis the show is a marvel of music and lighting. The music sometimes gentle sometimes bombastic feels right in this great venue. Yanni spends much of the time at the grand piano letting the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra take over many of the synthesized parts of the arrangements. The orchestra conducted by Shardad Rohani fills in the spaces in the prog rock format giving the music a fullness that fills the theatre.

There are highlights from his band also:a great drum solo by Charlie Adams, driving percussion by Michael Bruno and fiery violin solos by Karen Briggs.

While Yanni may not be to everyone's taste this is a good way to spend a couple of hours listening to music which you may not hear too often. Who knows you may even be taken aback by the experience. Recommended.",1231113600,,1415,4.30827067669173

Yanni's music had always bored me to death, but this live performance packs such a wallop to his music like never heard in the studio. Adding in the Royal Philharmonic gives much more stamina to his music. And you know his core band members are so into this that they put so much more energy into the performances that just couldn't be captured in the studio.

I bought this on VHS right away and played it until the VCR was smoking and eventually blew up! Later on DVDs hit the medium and as I saw and heard the visual and sonic potential of these little CD-like discs from earlier releases like the DTS enhanced Eagles ""When Hell Freezes Over"", I knew this concert video would be a prime candidate for a major DVD concert release.

Sadly, this release ended up being the most disappointing DVD I ever bought. The 5.1 mix is absolutely horrendous. Instead of utilizing the 64 track digital audio master tapes, they simply used the 2 track video soundtrack and artificially created some sort of surround mix that's completely out of balance. The rear channels seem to only come out of one side, so you're not getting a true multi-channel mix. The only way to reasonably listen to this is in the 2 channel PCM mode. Still sounds good, but the potential was completely wasted.

From what I've understood from Yanni's website, was he had no control over the production of this DVD. We can only pray that a complete re-master will eventually be done with his supervision. What a waste!",1191369600,28,1582,4.543859649122807

The chemistry between Yanni the audience and the orchestra (he has the backing of a great philarmonic orchestra and two virtuosos on the violin) are unique. The place where the consert takes place is a monument with thousand years of history Parthenon and the theater of Herodotus of Attiki which are uniqly lit for the occassion. Watching how the audience reacts to these unique compositions is incredible. Track number 7 is great, the two violin players it is as if they have a competition who will play faster. And the last one (reflections of passion) is propably one of the best songs he has ever composed. it was my wedding song. If you are planning to visit Greece get this dvd. Watch it beforehand to see what awaits you, and see it afterwards as well and for sure it will give you a strong desire to go back; as it did to me when I watched it for first time in 1997 and I was for three years in a row outside of Greece.

The guy can indeed cover the keyboards, the Royal Philharmonic is the best back-up band you could ask for, and the ""regular"" back-ups aren't shabby, either.  And it's the coolest concert venue this side of Red Rocks.  But the unimaginative camerawork just about ruins the show.  There are precioius few shows of Yanni's hands on the keyboards, too many poorly-framed musician close-ups, and, maybe worst of all, little coordination of music to the video (e.g., when there's a key solo they often don't show the soloist).",1123545600,,628,5.0

Let me assure potential buyers that the sound and video qualities are totally acceptable unless you're a serious audio/videophile. To refrain from buying it because of these trivial imperfections is quite silly in my opinion.

I really believe that this is one concert that everyone will love - regardless of their age and music preference. All musicians get to showcase their talents and yet all the different elements (bass guitar, percussion, drums, keyboards, the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra) somehow manage to fuse together into dynamic and truly enjoyable music. And of cause the gem in the performance has to be Karen Briggs who staked her claim to fame as the Lady in Red after this. Her violin duet with Shardad Rohani was positively overflowing with energy and spontaneity. You could see both of them totally enjoying themselves!

Regardless of whether you're a rock / blues / punk / jazz lover or classical aficionado, do yourself a favor and buy this. I've only got mine for less than 1 week and i've already watched it for more than 5 times. Highly recommended for all music lovers!",1119484800,2,1191,4.891089108910891

No one listens to music that way, it's rediculous.",1104796800,3,359,4.294117647058823
534703,5,6303011012,"If you love music at all, you will find that all you invite to your living room to wathc this dvd will be entranced by the passion within minutes! Orchestras usually do little for me since they are the extension of one mans creativity, and seem so limited... however this orchestra is given liberty to extend the boundaries to afford individual creativity which flows into a beautiful flow of colors to make a sound which will carry you on a journey of sight and sound. The power of Yanni's passion bleeds over to the orchestra as he brings out the best in them. Its the power of mathmatics of exponential quantems of music! You would think that 2 musicians are twice as good as one?, however they are 4 times better!... when you see so many of the best of the best play together in one synergistic flow you will weep as you are moved by the passionate power of this music. And yes the audio only does so much, but the video brings it all to life. I can almost promise you, you will not be dissapointed! After seeing this, I can play the audio in my car and am often moved to tears, as a toy boat in the crashing waves of the surf is forced to be moved.

I too am a musician and I appreciate quality music, but quality alone is easy to find, its rare that you find people who will pour out thier life and let thier instrument become an extension of thier soul and thier essence. I give highest marks!

Yanni - A musicians musician!",1094860800,7,1431,4.257352941176471
534704,5,6303011012,"Since the first time I saw Yanni's beautiful black hair I knew this DVD would provide me with the opportunity to watch it flow as he did his thing on stage.  Simple put, this DVD has changed my life and the lives of others around me.  Whatever you do in life, what ever difficult decisions you encounter Yanni and his band will always be there with you.  He loves the world, he loves his band, and he most certainly loves his hair.(as we all do)",1085529600,2,445,4.211764705882353
534705,5,6303011012,"From the very first moment that Yanni appears out of the floor the viewer is held transfixed in what is undoubtable the greatest concert ever given. This DVD has it all, dueling violins, a philharmonic director with attitude and of course Yanni's flowing majestic mane.
Of course, as with any Yanni production, re-watching and listening is a must. The sights and sounds are so bold that it becomes very easy to miss the subtle nuances that make Yanni great. Look for Yanni's winks the ladies in the crowd, what women wouldn't swoon! Watch Yanni's hand movements as he conducts the entire show, all while headbanging away with the addictive beat.
It isn't just Yanni that impresses, however. It would be a mistake to discount Yanni's bassist, either his playing or his permed locks. Which begs the question, who has better hair, Yanni or his bassist.
The Violinist in red, apperantly the maverick of the group, does her best to upstage the festivities, but is ultimitly cowered by the symphony director, who is in turn shown who is the really in charge by the man himself; Yanni.
I cannot urge you enough, buy this DVD, watch it over and over again; if you must slow motion the sequences, I know it can change  your life, but you must first let the music in.",1085443200,4,1257,4.662162162162162
534706,5,6303011012,"If possible, choose the surround sound option to get the whole effects of this delightful music.  The DVD is the only place you will hear 'ARIA' which is FANTASTIC!!  Don't miss this.",1082764800,4,183,4.6875
534720,5,6303011012,"If you are or you are not a Yanni fan I believe you will still enjoy this video. The music, muscianship and stage presence is amazing.",1058227200,3,134,4.1923076923076925
534721,5,6303011012,"I'm not a fan of ""new age"" music. However, I am a fan of Yanni Live at the Acropolis. The location of this concert is under the ancient Greek parthenon. The production of the show is great, the lighting makes the ancient theatre seem like it's in the same shape as it were in its prime. I saw this on PBS a long time ago and I haven't lost interest in the music since; the DVD reaffirms to a greater extent. Something special took place at the Acropolis that night and the video recreates most of the show.
The DVD is in 5.1 digital audio and the sound is superb. Yanni's music is awe-inspiring moving, and emotional. The concert was Yanni's return to Greece from his long departure to America. The emotions are flowing, he dedicates a song to his mother; the band and especially the violinist in the red dress play amazingly. Finally, the concert ends with Yanni addressing ""a thought"" to the audience concerning the human condition and ends the show to a standing ovation. One can only wonder what the ancient Greeks would think of this show after viewing Yanni: Live at the Acropolis. I think that they'd like it. I recommend this to anyone.",1053129600,29,1144,4.5048076923076925
534722,5,6303011012,"I was very excited to discover Acropolis on DVD. I used to have the video and a smaller television. I now have a 43 inch television and stereo system and was expecting to step into the picture to experience that evening with Yanni.
I love this concert -- have seen it many times on VHS years ago. I totally understand their acoustic problems involved, and that DVD's weren't in existence back when this concert took place. Regardless, I regret to say that they should NOT have released this on DVD unless they could overcome these sound and picture quality problems. The Tribute DVD is superior to this one in terms of its professinal, high quality production.",1033257600,9,660,4.698275862068965
534723,5,6303011012,"I would have loved to have been there.  This concert's CD was my introduction to Yanni's wonderful compositions, especially the powerful ""Within Attraction"", and so this DVD purchase was the next logical step.
The presentation, ambiance and emotion of the performances are wonderful, and I've watched selected pieces repeatedly.
The only detractor, which isn't a problem with the DVD, is the concert lighting itself.  Contiguous walls of the Acropolis are oftentimes illuminated with red against blue lighting.  This lighting effect, whether viewed on TV/video/DVD, comes across far too loud.
No such detractor, ultimately, can keep this concert from a 5 star rating.",1023580800,,667,5.519607843137255
534724,3,6303011012,"I have this on VHS as well, but I bought the DVD to enjoy through my new Dolby 5.1 surround sound system. Well, the first half of the disc sounds wonderful, but everything in the second half is badly mixed. The right-rear speaker plays almost inaudibly, while the left-rear keeps going at full volume. It's very annoying, and makes the experience less than it should be. The video quality is also not up to DVD standards-there's a lot of shimmering and pixellation, as well as really oversaturated colours. It's a shame, because the music is incredible. The technical flaws really sink this disc.",1019606400,,596,4.796116504854369
534725,4,6303011012,"When I first heard the music I thought it was in the Efteling. A Dutch themepark. They used the song 'Acroyali/Standing in Motion' in a Lasershow. I was amazed when I first heard this music, so I download the song, and after a while the whole album. But I was so amazed by his music that I bought the whole album!
After a I wanna to see the live concert of him, so we called some shops, and we found the vhs of the live concert. I was a whole new experience when I saw the vhs. The violins, the bass-guiter. So I wanna have the dvd too!
I found the dvd in the 'Private Years box', so I order it. A few weeks later the box arrived at my door. It was very exciting. But when I saw the dvd I was a little dissapointment.
The sound-effects are really good, but the video-quality is poor. The images are al little bit 'sheaky'. I think that they are used the wrong aquipment to put it on dvd.
But Yanni is still amazing, and I have already six cds of him :-)",1012780800,4,953,3.994764397905759
534726,5,6303011012,"This concert from evening of September 23, 1993, must have been a wonderful event to have experienced...the VHS of it is a polished gem that will never go out of style. The professionalism and musicianship is outstanding, and the setting is magical...with 2000 year old arches surrounding the open air stage, and the amazing structures of ancient Greece lit up against the night sky.
Shardad Rohani conducts the London Royal Pholharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as doing a terrific violin duet with Karen Briggs, the super violinist member of Yanni's fabulous group. Her solos are a knock-out, as well as those of the rest of the band, among them Charlie Adams on drums, Ric Fierabracci on bass, and Michael ""Kalani"" Bruno on percussion.
Yanni looks stunning and plays beautifully on a grand piano, as well as an assortment of keyboards...you can tell he is also leading the entire show...and it's quite a show.
There's a touching song he sings for his mother Felitsa, who sits in the audience, next to the gorgeous Linda Evans, both of them glowing with pride.
Directed by George Veras with 14 cameras, the editing is a marvel, a constant flow images that keeps one's interest and works to perfection with the music...the concert is an hour and 35 minutes long, with an added 5 minutes of backstage interviews.
This is one to take out of your tape library once in a while, and wish you'd been there, on this very special night under the Grecian stars.",1009065600,58,1455,4.800796812749004

I have watched and listened to the VHS tape many, many times and looked forward to the release of the DVD.  Finally it came and what a disappointment! The sound is is okay, not great as I expected, but okay.  But the picture quality is so bad, with the exception of a few close ups, that it is annoying and makes it almost impossible to enjoy the music.

It also sounded incredible.  Then I was looking around in late 1999 for the DVD version, only to find out that if I want it, I need to buy the whole Yanni set.  Finally, around early 2000, I got a hold of the DVD version, and was not impressed.  The sound quality was poor, the video quality was also poor.
