7912733,1,B00000JL3G,"Unfortunately, the creator of this DVD had ""fade""-itis!  Just as the eyes are settling into the scene, it is fading into the next.  Basically, what you have is a photographer's view of Yosemite, not a filmaker's.  The pictures are vivid, brilliant, and sensuous, yet there is never enough time to take them in since the view is almost immediately fading into the next one.",991094400,6,372,4.78125
7912734,5,B00000JL3G,"If you enjoy Yosemite and or natural beauty, then look no further. This DVD will not disappoint anyone in either catagory!  As an owner and producer of a Yosemite video myself, I have always searched for a program  that showcases the natural splendors of the park without intrusive  narration. Yosemite- The Seasons accomplishes this, and more. Sterling  Johnson's cinematography is stunning. He has choreographed the natural  tapestry of Yosemite's seasons in a grand way. And the custom soundtrack  from Douglas Spotted Eagle is moving and powerful. You'll find yourself  watching this one over and over. I also highly recommend Sterling's other  Yosemite DVD: Watersongs",957484800,6,673,5.403846153846154
7912735,4,B00000JL3G,"Breathtaking scenery (thanks to Mother Nature) and breathtaking shots (thanks to the cameraman). The editing though got on my nerves the first time I watched it. The picture changes every 5-6 seconds with  fade-in-fade-out transitions. Hardly any time to contemplate the natural  beauty. And the camera moves all the time. Imagine: slow pan to the left 5  seconds, fades out, pan right fades in, 5 seconds then it fades out just to  let in a zoom out and so on. Looks a bit like those CNN ""sights and  sounds"" montage. If you can get used to this, you'll enjoy the  presentation. Also, wonderful dvd transfer!",948153600,8,609,4.752380952380952
