7901843,4,6301857542,"Anthrax here produced a very good VHS release that spoke directly to their fans and shows the same care and attention that their Attack of the Killer B's EP showed. Comprising 9 promotional videos spanning the bands career from Metal Thrashing Mad - a video unavailable previously as it was from Megaforce archives - through to the videos for the Persistence of Time album this is a very worthwhile package for the Anthrax fan even after all these years.

To put it bluntly, Anthrax during the 80's were one of the `Big Four' of thrash and the reasons for this are obvious. A fiercely metallic band that had a sense of humour and could actually laugh at themselves but who gave the impression that they could also hold a conversation the band came out with a bunch of songs that were heavy duty. And the videos for them haven't really dated too badly at all. Which is more than can be said for most videos of pretty much any genre or time period. Another reason why this release is a quality purchase for the fans is that the band are interviewed in between the songs. We don't get subjected to the sort of banal behind the scenese garbage so many bands seemed to think we were interested in, we actually get considered comments as to the bands thinking and feelings about their history.

And really those are the main two reasons why I recommend this release whole heartedly. The quality metal and the worthwhile interludes between the videos. Any Anthrax fan should try to get this on some sort of format if they can as it shows a band still holding things together with a sense of purpose and mission.",1195171200,,1604,4.527586206896552
