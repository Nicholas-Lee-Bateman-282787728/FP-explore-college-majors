I saw the Yanni program and became acquainted with his talent and music genre.  This DVD is of a live performance. There isn't any indication of where this performance took place.  There are several original musical pieces with which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I really enjoyed there being a couple of musical instruments that I have not noticed when watching other artists perform.  It wasn't my musical preference with his musical arrangement of 2 numbers with just the guitar and himself.  Love the DVD and I have watched it many, many times.  When you see them pan around the audience, you can see they are loving the performance as well.",1485129600,,759,4.792307692307692
