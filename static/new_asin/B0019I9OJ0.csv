8274122,1,B0019I9OJ0,The item came on time but it was very scratched and we were unable to play it in any device.  Disappointed in the quality considering the cost of the DVD.,1420588800,,154,4.133333333333334
8274123,5,B0019I9OJ0,"The Anthology is good for anyone who is interested in James Baldwin, but hasn't seen much of him on film. The major portion covers a speech he made at Berkely in the 1970s, and he speaks very much how he writes. The introduction by Angela Davis shows her sweet side.",1340150400,3,266,4.34

8274125,3,B0019I9OJ0,One of the directors took a picture of James Baldwin and uses it to fill up space on the DVD.  The photo is used in a series of collages and they distract the focus of the DVD from James Baldwin to the author as an artist.,1314403200,7,222,3.8260869565217392
