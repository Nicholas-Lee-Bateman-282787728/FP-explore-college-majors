7937509,5,B00005BIG3,"I saw this two-part documentary a couple of years ago and swore I'd buy the DVD, and forgot.  Saw it again recently, swore again, and bought it just now !!  This has to be the best high-level summary of the creation, development, and workings of our planet around. The images are just gorgeous, the narrative scripting intelligent and just plain poetic at times, and the delivery by Stewart, arguably the best documentary narrator around now, just perfect.  The words draw us into the images and the images made us want to hear more words.

A beautiful place born and sustained thru the chance forces of nature, our Earth.  It matters not that the science is uncertain at times, nor that we know less about these forces than we might wish to. We have enough of a plausible outline of this history here to buy the partial story we as humans have.

Particularly stunning to this 55+ year resident of the San Francisco Bay Area who has rarely lived more than 40 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge was the image of future waters rising to envelop our beloved coddled structure not because of puny humans but because of nature.  That really finishes bringing the story home to this viewer.  I think we need the additional reminder Amazing Earth brings us - it is not we who are in charge, it's nature.

Highly recommended.",1186012800,4,1316,4.613733905579399
7937510,1,B00005BIG3,"My husband and I bought this DVD in hopes of learning and seeing more detailed information on earthquakes, volcanos etc. Instead, we were VERY disappointed in this DVD.

It turned into a propaganda film to promote evolution.  If we had wanted to purchase a DVD on evolution, then we would have.  But we did not.

It also showed very little interesting footage.  There were a few volcano before and after shots, which were good, but otherwise, I got tired of watching hot lava and aged rocks over and over again.

There were also several scientists reporting their theories, but none presented any real conclusive evidence to back up their findings, besides the carbon dating of rocks.

In the end, my husband (who is more logical than my self and did not want to waste the money we spent on the video) suggested we resell it to some other unsuspecting person, I personally would rather have just tossed it or burned it.",1133136000,,919,4.670807453416149

1. Some of the things are not clear (Ex. How water has come to Earth)

2. Nothing about poles, earths rotation etc.

It is a very good DVD to keep.",1112832000,17,269,3.943396226415094

7937513,5,B00005BIG3,"Patrick Stewart takes us on a fascinating journey on our Earth's evolution from the compression of ""space junk"" to the ultimate end of the planet as we know it. I first watched this on the Discovery Channel about a year ago and had taped it (alas it was taped over unknowingly) so that I could digest all of the information presented. It will take several times of viewing before I will be able to take in all of the facts. Don't suppose that this DVD is dry and boring though. All of the information is presented in layman's terms, with any technical terms being fully explained as far as I can tell.
The DVD presents it all in beautiful scenes of our planet as few have ever seen it, by taking us to exotic locales and making us look a little closer at things we may see every day. There is one scene along the San Andreas fault line that shows a tortured cross section of rock by a freeway that is literally just down the street from my house.
I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has more than a passing interest in how our planet came to be as we know it today. The future of the planet may be grim, but hey, I won't be around to complain about it in a couple million years ;)",1003104000,75,1186,4.160869565217391
