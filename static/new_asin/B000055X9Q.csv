7931172,4,B000055X9Q,"This is a wonderful adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classics.
The story is compelling, drawing you in from the beginning.  It is full of charm, magic, and biblical imagary, appealing to viewers of all ages.  My 4 year old has watched it repeatedly, and so have I.  Although the special effects are less-than-spectacular (if you're looking for LOTR grandeur, you'll be disapppointed), that does NOT  take away from the story itself.  It truely is wonderful, and a must-have for any collection.",1048032000,2,489,4.987654320987654
7931173,3,B000055X9Q,"I am not positive that this listing is the same as mine. I am refering to the 3 pack edition which the BBC put together from 1988-1990. While the story line is carefully followed, the acting is terrible, the costumes seem to be leftovers from the Dr. Who series, and the sound is often times muffled and difficult to understand. So, as an adult I would give it three stars, BUT, AS A CHILD... MY CHILDREN SIMPLY LOVED IT AND WOULD GIVE IT FIVE STARS!!!",1022025600,4,452,4.329411764705882
