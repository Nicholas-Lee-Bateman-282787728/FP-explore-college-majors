8290287,4,B001CWLF8Q,"have dvd version, and have seen bluray. The bluray is crisp and english subtitles are good.
The extras on bluray seem to be same ason dvd.",1504483200,,138,4.346153846153846
8290288,5,B001CWLF8Q,"A vast improvement even over the R2 DVD set from the UK issued by the BBC.  The detail, for a set of films shot on 16mm is absolutely astonishing.  The color temperature is a little cool, but the series has otherwise never looked better.  It's still 16mm stock, so there are limitations on the visual information, but this set is probably the best the series will ever look, and is many times better than the old BFS sets which were essentially dups off of the 3/4"" broadcast duplicates distributed to various stations for broadcasting.

Relive Sharpe's adventures as he, Harper and the rest of the 95th engage Napoleon's forces on the Iberian peninsula.

Definitely worth buying, but you need to either buy another bluray player or reset your current region if you're here in the states.

Enjoy.",1489017600,4,796,4.773722627737226
