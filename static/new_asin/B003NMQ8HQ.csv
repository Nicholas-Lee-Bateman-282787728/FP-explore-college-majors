8401258,5,B003NMQ8HQ,One of my favorites for explaining the disease of addiction and why people continue to use drugs many consider illicit and illegal. I love the history lesson and the message.,1443225600,,174,4.833333333333333
8401259,5,B003NMQ8HQ,"I'm currently an Intern at a Drug and Alcohol Recovery Clinic.  Both of these video's are well worth the purchase price for any Clinic wishing to show it's clients the damaging effects of Crystal Meth.  America's Meth Epidemic shows all aspects of this nasty drug and how it ruins lives everyday.  Hooked: Illegal Drugs and How they got that way is an extremely interesting video also.  Now I can see how many drug and alcohol clinics might not want to show this to there clients because of the fact that this video shows the reality of how drugs became illegal in this country.  They did not become illegal because of health concerns, they did not become illegal because of people using drugs were breaking other laws.  They became illegal for another reason all together and that reason is RACISM.  Racism fueled it from the start and as every drug became illegal you can see the connection race had to play in it.  For example take Cocaine, it was brought here by African slaves who ate the leaves and we as white american slave holders encouraged this behavior because they would work harder and do so with out causing a ruckus.  However, it wasn't long before cocaine was in many american products like Coke a Cola, different elixirs claiming health benefits and things of this sort.  When it started becoming wide spread it was right around the time we finally gave blacks there freedom and the white man hated it and them.  So they made claims that black men were luring white women into doing cocaine and then they were raping them.  This was of course all complete lies told by the propaganda machines as usual.  When there is a group of people white people don't like we do everything in our power to make others believe they are evil and the things that they do are evil and so Cocaine became illegal.  Same thing happened with opium and the Chinese and the same thing happened with marijuana and the indians.  So while I can see why a clinic may not what to show this film because it contains the truth I still highly recommend it to all my colleges because our clients are not stupid.  They will know when we are lying to them and they will know when the information we give them is slanted all one way.  Showing this will give them a balance view point and will show a point of honesty within your teachings.",1294617600,6,2322,4.516746411483253
