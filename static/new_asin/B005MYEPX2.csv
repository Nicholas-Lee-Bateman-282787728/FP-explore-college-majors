4839319,3,B005MYEPX2,"This movie is NOT the ""Natalee Holloway"" movie that aired on Lifetime Movie Network in 2009. That movie was a ""true crime"" feature that focused on Natalee's disappearance and presented a number of hypothetical scenarios that might explain her fate on the island of Aruba. That movie also included references to many of the large number of people who have come forward since Natalee's disappearance claiming to have some knowledge of what happened to her.

This movie, by contrast, focuses more strictly on Natalee's mother and her efforts to extract some solid information from Joran van der Sloot, presumed by most investigators to have played some key role in Natalee's vanishing. ""Justice for Natalee"" traces Beth Holloway's anguished response to one after another of van der Sloot's teasing implications that he would reveal Natalee's whereabouts - for a price, for publicity, for a variety of other considerations. As depicted here, van der Sloot keeps Beth Holloway on an emotional roller-coaster by continuously dangling the possibility of giving her some closure. It's a depiction of a true sociopath, someone for whom killing might be just the start of his cruelty.

I had a little trouble ""getting into"" this true-life drama. The actors chosen to portray members of the van der Sloot family never seem to master a Dutch accent. Their speech is halting and unconvincing. Then especially at the beginning of the film, there's some over-use of a split-screen technique, with two and even three boxes of narrative running at once. The viewer is fractioned into too many simultaneous plot lines and time-lines, making the film resemble a 3-ring circus. But once the action settles into one coherent narrative, you are likely to be better drawn into Beth's pain as she turns the resolution of the mystery of her daughter's disappearance into her whole existence.

This film looks just a bit too make-shift and made-for-TV for me to rate it 4 stars, but it is still worth viewing. Again, although its emphasis is not on the true-crime aspects of this case, it does follow van der Sloot's trajectory through to the provable crime he ends up committing.",1330128000,4,2154,5.044943820224719
4839320,4,B005MYEPX2,"amazon does not allow reviewers half stars.  this movie would be graded 3.5 by me if i could do so because it is a tv movie and does achieve what it sets out to do.  it cannot be compared to the quality of a feature film though.

tracy pollan does a good job as beth holloway, the mother of presumably murdered Natalee Holloway. her daughter's body was never found although it was suspected that a young man in Aruba murdered her. he was seen with her the last night she was seen alive but there is no evidence linking him to murdering her.

beth holloway is a hard character to like.  this is because she is absolutely obsessed by this case and will in no way come to any sort of peace over the loss of her daughter.  this might be less grating if she didn't have another child, a son, in college, plus a now ex husband, whom she drove away with this obsession. she even uses the son's college tuition money to fund her obsession. (this i find a black mark on her character.) however, on the other hand, it must be incredibly difficult to come to terms with a death when there is no body. holloway pursues this young man in Aruba as if getting him will put both her and Natalee at rest.  I have my doubts.

this actually could have been a stunning feature film about the destructive force of obsession on everyone around you but the resulting movie would have been a very harrowing look at beth holloway.  probably no one wants to make that while she is alive because she has already suffered enough. i am sure no one can be around beth holloway for long as this obsession is her entire raison d'etre. it must be very difficult being her son.

8480026,3,B005MYEPX2,"Sequel to the 2009 made for TV movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natalee-Halloway/dp/B002MJV77M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natalee Halloway</a>&nbsp;which are both based on the true disappearance of an American teenager in Aruba, who still at the time of this review has not been found and no one knows what happened to her.  This one like the first movie follows the mother Beth (played by Tracy Pollan) who is determined to bring the person who she thinks is responsible to justice and hopefully have him tell her what happened to Natalee and where she or her body is.  You're better off to stop reading this review now if you haven't seen the first film, go and rent, borrow or buy that and watch it first, since the first one gives a lot of scenarios as to what happened to Natalee and this one concentrates on just one (and probably the most likely suspect).  But is he the one responsible, or is he just a guy who likes the fame from being a suspect and likes to cash in by manipulating Beth and the media to play his games?

Although both films cast Pollan as Beth, it is surprising that pretty much every other character, including the actor playing Joran Van Der Sloot, the other main character in this, are played by different actors to those in the first film.  I know a lot of actors don't want to be typecast so avoid sequels and so forth, but these are TV actors, none of the first film have gone onto anything major, you'd think they would have at least finished their character's stories in a sequel only made years after the original.  Even the guy in the van with him who had such a minor screentime role in the first is a different guy which is where this one picks up events from.  Be interesting to know if someone in the crew or something was so hard to work for/with that so many actors didn't return for this sequel.

Even with the noticeable different actors, this is still a pretty decent film that is worth the time taken to watch it.  We still of course don't know what happened to Natalee, and if we ever do, there's could well be a third movie down the track.",1506556800,,2136,4.644562334217507
8480027,1,B005MYEPX2,Disc didn't work on any of my players. Other regio 1 disc play without trouble so that it not the problem.,1503014400,,106,4.095238095238095
8480028,3,B005MYEPX2,"I will start out by writing I did not see the first 15 minutes or so of this film, as I started recording it after it started on TV.  I did see the rest of it however, and I don't think missing the first bit probably matters much to my review score.

I do know quite a bit about this case; who in America doesn't at this point?  Girl graduates from high school, takes trip to Aruba, goes missing under more-than suspicious circumstances, and then seemingly never gets ""justice,"" assuming she was killed.  But I don't believe that this case has ever been technically ""solved,"" even though Joran van der Sloot appears to be a very good suspect, for obviously many reasons.  But just because van der Sloot was convicted later of killing another gal in South America, it obviously doesn't necessarily prove that he also killed Natalee.

(While I believe that van der Sloot is guilty of this crime as well, there are some scenarios where he didn't kill Natalee, that still make sense.  For example, let's say he just used the case in order to extort money from Natalee's mother.  In that unlikely but possible scenario, he might've pretended to be guilty without actually admitting anything, in order to play a cat-and-mouse game for money.  And then later on, he decides to actually kill someone else.  I do think this scenario probably isn't what happened, but it is possible.)

At any rate, the real star of this show -- if there is one -- is Beth Holloway, played by Tracy Pollan.  I think that Pollan does a good job here, after seeing so many interviews with the real Beth Holloway for myself.  And then the next best character is probably van der Sloot himself, played very well by Stephen Amell.  Amell is pretty convincing, because if anyone ever makes a mistake in these types of movies, it is playing the evil character ""too evil.""  Even evil people have moments of kindness -- even Ted Bundy walked Ann Rule out to her car at night, in order to ""protect her,"" after all -- and so I think that Amell works here.  And I'm sure that the director had a hand in this too.

But most of this film is really a chess game between the mother of a missing daughter, and a most-likely serial-killer-in-the-making.  Each player tries to make a subtle move to gain a slight advantage at every turn; Beth tries to get Joran to confess or slip up legally, while Joran tries to evidently get a little more money to fund his bad gambling habits.  I'm not sure that either one of them really ""wins,"" although I'm giving nothing away when I say that van der Sloot is now in prison for about three decades in South America, while Beth has her own television show.  OK; I guess that Beth wins.

I'm going with a 3 today, but it's probably more like a 3.5.  It is decent enough that I'm considering renting the other film, I believe called ""Natalee,"" and then maybe even paying for a rental to catch the first 15 minutes of this one.",1493596800,2,2917,4.474480151228733

8480030,1,B005MYEPX2,ENOUGH about this damn case already. You don't even have to buy it. Just leave your cable on to LMN or watch all you can watch on You Tube and then watch that loud mother of hers go on and on about this. It never ends and it just isn't worth purchasing. ALL that you need to know about this case can be found on You Tube over 20 times. Save your money for better movies on true crime cases. This one was WAY over done.,1431734400,,418,3.872093023255814

8480032,3,B005MYEPX2,"Stephen Amell played his charter amazingly well and truely made this movie worth watching. He really made it clear how disturbed and deranged Joran VanderSloot is.  However, Natalie Holloway's mother comes accross as just plain annoying and irritating.  I never got that vibe when I watched her in the news so it must be the actresses portrayal.  Worth a watch but not worth buying.",1424390400,,382,4.9375
