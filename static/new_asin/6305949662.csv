Ok...so that's my lame line, however this movie is just a fun movie to watch. A lot of people are not big fans of Affleck, which I get, but in movies like this, where he's kind of bumping along and seems to be having fun, I find him entertaining. A very good cast for a movie that is just fun to watch. There are some twists, but they don't do much to enhance or detract from a fun flick. Ho Ho Ho",1480636800,,509,4.0

If the thing you dislike about modern moviemaking is the lack of focus on rendering a film that allows the audience to suspend their disbelief, you may not like this film.

If you are getting tired of story lines with a seemingly unending series of twists, turns, and surprises .... just for the sake of twists, turns, and surprises, you may not like this film.

If you just love Ben Affleck no matter what he is, in you may like this film.

If you just love Charlize Theron no matter what she is in, you may like this film.

1090905,3,6305949662,"This is a silly and funny film, in that order, with lots of action that is not very moving. The film is about an ex-convict, a former car-thief, who while in prison hears his friend, his cell-mate, tell him frequently about the woman who wrote to him and told him she loves him and wants to sleep with him; while this is not what he, the car thief, wants. He wants to go home to a peaceful life, have hot chocolate, and pie. He sees pictures, semi-naked of the woman. She is lovely. His friend is killed.
When he is released, she is waiting for his friend. After an internal struggle, attracted by her, he greets her, and identifies himself as his friend.
All goes well until a group of gangsters - actually, an ex-truck driver and his pals - confront him and tell him that he was, in essence, seduced by the letters because he (actually, his friend) had worked in a gambling establishment, and they want his input because they want to rob it. None of the gang had ever committed robbery before. But the truck-driver seems insane and will kill on a whim.
He tries to tell the gang the truth, that he is not who the gang thinks he is. They do not believe him.
How will he handle the situation and how will he handle the woman who has fallen in love with him? Will he end up in jail again?",1459382400,,1287,4.235772357723577

1091085,5,6305949662,"REINDEER GAMES is tragically John Frankenheimer's last film as Director
John Frankenheimer tragically sadly passed away (Died) back in 2002 about 2 years after Reindeer Games was released in Theaters
Reindeer Games was John's last mainstream Action thriller film
an excellent suspense thriller for sure
 despite what the Movie critics say who gave alot of Negative reviews about the film and it's Director
also Despite what Charlize theron said about her acting performance in the film back in 2007
Charlize said she considered Reindeer Games to be her worst acting performance
which i found very ridiculous for sure
Charlize theron gave an excellent performance as Deranged Girlfriend Ashley
and so Did Gary sinise aswell
every scene in this film has lots of suspense, Great Directing by John Frankenheimer in my opinion

Lionsgate has reissued the film on blu-ray now with the Directors cut version which has extra scenes edited back in
with a new HD transfer in 2:35:1 widescreen
and the picture quality does look amazing, very clear & sharp picture better quality than the old dvd release
and a new 5.1 Master audio mix

about the special features, all the same extras from the dvd release have been carried over
the feature length Audio commentary by John Frankenheimer
plus the Behind the scenes featurette and Theatrical trailer
Reindeer Games is one of my favourite Frankenheimer film's for sure no Doubt about it
John Frankenheimer definitely makes a big bang with his last film ever

time to upgrade with this new blu-ray version
5 stars for sure",1426809600,,1556,5.042801556420233

1091273,3,6305949662,"Reindeer Games is not the worst movie ever, but it is not an award winner either.  It is somewhat formulaic plot wise, including the various twists throughout regarding where the loyalties of Charlize Theron's character lies.  It centers around Ben Affleck's character Rudy, who has been in prison for 5 years for stealing cars.  He gets out and hooks up with his cell mate's pen pall, passing himself off as his cellmate who has died in a prison fight.  From there he is set up into participating in the robbery of a casino on Christmas Eve.

There are some humorous moments and Gary Sinise plays a pretty good bad guy.  Albeit somewhat over the top.  Although that is the tone it seems the movie was going for.  Even though the cast is loaded with talented actors (or at least those who are seen as talented these days) the writing was bad enough that really nobody was going to do any better job with the material.

On the non director's cut version of the movie the only extra is a short making of feature and the trailer.  There is a blu ray version that has a directors cut and may have more features, but this is not really a movie that I would put in a must own on blu ray category.",1400112000,,1190,4.343891402714932

1091278,4,6305949662,"There are plenty of plot summaries and opinions already published here so I will only focus on the actual quality of the film's transfer to Blu Ray.  My rating is based upon that quality with no relation to whether the movie is good or not.

VIDEO.
  Nice clean transfer with no artifacts or aliasing noticed anywhere.  Grain is kept to a bare minimum and I saw no dropouts originating from a poor master.  Since much of the film takes place during overcast days, there were some scenes where I felt that skin colors took on a greenish tinge.  Focus is a bit soft but contrast is good and blacks go deep. Of course, this will display itself based upon the quality of the TV monitor you are using as well.  I do not believe that this film was remastered, as I expected, for this Director's Cut.  Yes, some scenes were extended and such but that does not mean a full remastering of the film.  I noticed no motion artifacts anywhere but do not see that much difference between the Standard Def version and this Blu Ray.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the high teens to low 20's.

AUDIO
  The audio is a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 which produced a nicely transparent dialogue.  There is some nice use of the front left and right surrounds for discreet directionality of foley fx but this is not frequently the case.  The rear surrounds are used primarily for ambience and do not come into play for any directionality.  The LFE channel has some instances of deep bass but, once again, it doesn't really get a whole heck of a lot of use.

EXTRAS.There are several original theater scenes that show the differences between the Directors cut and the Theatrical release.  However, the menu for these scenes provide no 'Play All' choice so that each time you finish one scene you have to go back to the main menu, click over to extras and then back down to the next theatrical scene.  This is a horrible menu design.
Other extras include the typical director commentary, the trailer and a 'Behind the Scenes' documentary which I did not watch.

Over all, this is a decent film on Blu Ray but not a huge quality difference in its imaging.  However, the plus is that you are getting the directors cut which really is different than that which was released in the theaters.

I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

1091412,5,6305949662,"I must admit, I was a little underwhelmed by the original theatrical cut of Reindeer Games. Just expected better from this amazing director John Frankenheimer. I was disappointed once I found out that the studio and producers took his movie and made it audience friendly. That's the problem with pre-screenings. Depends on the location and the people's attitudes when watching a film. This ""newer"" version removes things and adds things to make it the movie that is on this awesome looking and sounding blu ray. The VERY informative commentary by the great, late director is almost as good as the movie. Don't start asking what scenes were added and which ones were dropped. Get your eight bucks out and buy this blu ray and the director in detail tells you what is the same and what is different in the versions. There are actually ""original theatrical cut alternate scenes"" in the special features. Even if you are not a huge fan of this under-rated action movie, the director's commentary pays for the disc itself.
It just shows you what a studio does to one's vision. Reminds me what Fox did with David Fincher's Alien 3. I would kill to see his version of his movie (the longer cut in Alien Quadrilogy is NOT his cut)because Fincher wound up being an awesome director!
I am just thankful that John frankenheimer left us his great movies to enjoy for years to come.
Rest in peace. You, as a fan of your films, are sorely missed.

I am reviewing the Director's Cut Blu-Ray version released on 03/06/12.  I noticed no difference in the movie with this Director's Cut compared to the version I recently saw on satellite TV.  The aspect ratio is 2.35:1, not 1.85:1.  Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is really great (lot's of surround sound and sub-woofer bass).  Video quality is outstanding.

But, simply put, this film is a joke! And it's supposed to be dead serious. It makes no sense. The plot is as shaky as the San Andreas fault.
The actors appear to follow directions and follow a script. But directions and script lead them along a loopy road indeed. It occurred to me that one way to get the most out of this film is to just turn off the sound and make up your own story.

Plus, it mocks the Christmas spirit. Imagine, Santa uses very bad words and fires automatic weapons at innocent people! A running joke is one character's repeated reference to Santa's ""dwarves.""

Especially the wacked-out ""Merlin,"" played by Clarence Williams III, which hearkens one back to his equally psychotic character in Roy Scheider's 1986 movie: ""52 Pick-Up.""

That Rudy was actually able to concoct a plan of escape (and revenge) in so short a time, with all the odds stacked against him; was a minor miracle. But then again, it's the movies.

In fact, I think it is flawless except for the lame-brained twist that was thrown in at the end, but that didn't ruin it so I stick to my five stars. I'm going to have to start trusting Elmore Leonard a lot more, because his mini-review on the cover sums up everything well. ""Reindeer Games Rocks! A High-Energy Thriller That Never Lets Go."" He's more accurate than Stephen King has been about certain movies. Anyways, the movie stars Ben Affleck as Rudy; a prison inmate who listens to his cellmate Nick talk about his penpal. The penpal is Ashley (Charlize Theron) who waits for Nick to get out of prison. Rudy and Nick each get out on the same day (3 days) and discuss what they're going to do. Nick is going to meet up with Ashley, Rudy is going to get some hot chocolate. But then, Nick dies and Rudy assumes his identity and meets up with Ashley. Things click between Rudy and Ashley (she's under the impression he's Nick) but then things change again. Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) has read some of the letters and plans to use Nick to help him and his gang rob a casino. Explaining to them that he's not Nick, does Rudy no good and he ends up being caught up inescapably part of the plan. The movie also boasts an impressive cast that includes Dennis Farina (Get Shorty), Danny Trejo (The Devil's Rejects), and Donal Logue (TV's Grounded for Life). Now, besides the great plot and interesting twists; the movie is also fueled by some great performances. Affleck is believable as Rudy and Theron is perfect at going from good girl to deceitful b**ch. It's Sinise that really packs some punch though. This is Gary Sinise in top form and this is the role that he is meant to play. The long haired, bearded bad guy. Sinise truly delivers some great supporting work here. This is one of the most exciting action films I've seen in a long time and if you're not a big fan of action films, well there's a bonus...Check out Charlize Theron's nude scene (not a sex scene, but a pre-sex scene; You can count on seeing some t 'n' a though).

I'm glad I borrowed it now - don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but I doubt I'd watch it again. It's very Christmassy though. And we get to see Ben Affleck's butt - although he's got a bit of a fuzzy chest. Can't have it all, can we? There's a lot of butt to pinch there!

Most of the plot is very unbelieveable in this, and there's lot of violence that is in very bad taste. The ending is hinted at at the beginning - don't be eating at the start - and by the time the movie does finish off after a very long & dragged out process, there's been so many twists, that you're left wondering who's double/triple crossing who, and some twists reverse the direction you thought the film was travelling in. The twists are the cause for making the film less believeable, because they just wouldn't happen! And they're cliched to boot. Of course there's the usual, `I-won't-kill-you-now, I'll-give-you-an-exotic-and-elaborate-death-that-never-works' clich along with countless others.

I loved the poster for this, although it looks airbrushed beyond belief. I loved nearly all the actors in this, although I didn't like Gary Sinise as the bad guy. He wasn't very believeable. Ben Affleck was great, showing off his tattooed arms, and Little Miss Blemish-Free, Clear Skin Charlize Theron shows she can hold a film, and also managed to get in some practice for her future film, Monster. Watching this, made me dig out Sweet November and have a good cry over that. If you blush easily, there's a rather saucy scene between Benny & Charlize, which practically made me blush! And his butt takes up most of the screen, that can't be a good thing! I'm not sure that scene was handled so well, it could have been done with a lot more taste. And after seeing Charlize so many times in Devil's Advocate, I'm sick of seeing her charms shall we say! Although I'm sure the guys aren't. If you've got it, flaunt it, as some people say it, and boy does she ever! Also, it's cold and boys, we girls would not go braless, cos certain things - well, put it this way, we have on as many layers as possible. Charlize must have been freezing throughout shooting!

There's not much to recommend about this movie. I assume from the theatrical to the director's cut, most of the saucier scenes were cut, as were most likely the shoot out scenes. It's a good movie to lose a couple of hours to, but if you're expecting a fast paced movie, then this isn't for you.",1100736000,3,2522,4.526315789473684
1091447,5,6305949662,"Ben Affleck fan,gives a good performance and  manages to be the hero in this film.

Affleck plays a prison inmate, Rudy Duncan who is

about to be released in 3 days with his pal  NIck Cassidy (James Frain).

Nick is an ex-convict who dreams about the girl

that keeps writing him letters, who he has never met. Ashley Mercer.

Everthing seems great for Nick and Rudy,but  a prison lunch room fight ends up in the killing of Nick. Rudy just barely ends up getting killed himself.

Then on the day of his release ,Rudy awaits outside along with

the other inmates for the bus that will take them away from their hell hole.

Rudy is about to board the bus when he spots a girl waiting for somebody.

Taking into consideration that Ashley,Nick's admirer doesnt know that Nick has been killed ,Rudy realizes that this girl is indeed Ashley. However, knowing that the girl is waiting for Nick, Rudy decides to take the identity of his friend.

This at first seems like a good decision that Rudy has made, he gets to spend a night with a great girl,but then trouble starts brewing in.

Ashley's so called brother,Gabriel (played well by Gary Sinise) enters and he starts to beat the hell out of Rudy, thinking that Rudy is indeed Nick.

You see Nick used to work in the gambling casinos and he was planning a big robbery which would make him rich.

Rudy at first denies he is NIck,but this just  leads to more trouble, then Rudy tries to make a run for it and he is caught.

Then Rudy goes along with the fact that he is Nick

and manages to stay long enough to turn the

tables on the would be burglars.

There is alot more to Reindeer Games, at first

we are lead to belive that Ashley and Gabriel are siblings,

but later on this is not the case.

There are so many twists and turns that just

when you think it's over,it's not.

This is the latest movie by John Frankenheimer and

he shows that he can still make great movies in the

year 2000 (He has been making films for over 50 years.)

Id tell you more, but that would take all the fun

out of it.

Dont listen to the critics, they too were fooled

by the different twists of the movie.

The movie became a big box office hit and made Ben Affleck recognizable as more than a comedic, drama type actor, he has shown that he can play the hero too.",1099699200,5,2298,4.282051282051282

1091449,2,6305949662,"Reindeer Games is an action movie, of this there can be no doubt.

 It makes no bones about its intent, showing the audience gored and flaming men in Santa suits in the first thirty seconds of film. Obviously, with landmarks like these, its going to be a rocky trip, and, judging by the gaping hole in the jolly belly of one unfortunate Kringle, it's a journey with a not-so-happy ending.

 Ben Affleck is the Rudolph in our little story, guiding the plot. The metaphor is hard to miss, as his character, a car thief just getting out on parole, is called ""Rudy."" Rudy's cell-mate, Nick (alaus, perhaps?), has had a five month ""relationship"" via the post office with a lovely girl named Ashley (played with flat-faced pluck by Charlize Theron). Once he gets out of the slammer, Nick will finally get to meet the girl in the pictures, and Ashley will finally get to see what Nick looks like.

 But, alas, Nick is stabbed with a shiv before he leaves, and its up to the lonely and (I'm guessing here) sexually frustrated Rudy to approach her under the guise of his late cellmate. Ashley and Rudy hit it off and consummate their relationship. Of course, things go downhill from there.

 Since the late Nick once worked in a casino, he is wanted by several thugs to lead a heist on his former place of employment. Heading off our gang of rowdy ragamuffins is Gary Sinise as the extremely unattractive head bad guy, Gabriel. Sinise plays his part with sneering extravagance; his performance is one-note, and although it's a decent note, it drags the speed of the movie down. With a body twice as big as his head (obviously he bulked up for the role) Sinise never really achieves a believably threatening level of villainry. Because his menace is only partially convincing, the movie only partially works. What is lacking is the following:

 Our protagonist, Rudy, mentions a number of times that he is not Nick. He'll say he's not Nick, his life will be threatened, and then he'll say he is Nick. This sequence happens about four to five to seventeen times in the movie. Gabriel is either an idiot, or he's an idiot. Although screenwriter Kruger has given us an element of suspense by adding confusion as to how much Rudy does and doesn't know about Nick and his past, he also succeeds in aggravating the plot with the continuous frictional contrivance that is Rudy's inability to make up his mind about his identity. Because Rudy changes courses so often, Gabriel's own threats against his life are called into question, and since Rudy can't die (at least not until the end, if at all), Gabriel must pretend to believe Rudy's pleas that he IS Nick, and the audience must shift about in their seats some more.

 There is no skimming here of the good ole' elements of all traditional action movies: every element is present and accounted for right down to the cheesy bad-guy-reveals-his-plot-right-before-leaving-the-hero-in-an-easily-escapabl e-death-trap scene. Don't look for unexpected twists or turns, but just for blaring guns, hallway running shots, and plenty of sex. It is a Frankenheimer film.

 In a lot of ways, Reindeer Games wants to be more than it is. The craft of the filming and the clarity of the cinematography aren't weak by any means, but the movie essentially fumbles most critically where its plot is the thickest. In the end, you're left watching a movie that, while eminently entertaining on the most superficial of levels, is still just another excuse to watch guys shooting each other. Instead of a story that runs away with you, Games just seems to be toying around.",1091491200,4,3588,4.775444264943457
1091450,3,6305949662,"This supposed thriller, released in 2000, has a few good moments.  One is the way that its stars Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron couple soon after they first meet.  Ben Affleck just been released from prison, you see.  And she's there to meet him.  She's been writing letters to his cellmate, Nick, who has just been knifed.  Ben Affleck tells her he's Nick.  Then things get complicated. Very complicated.
Gary Sinise enters the scene as the bad guy.  And there's a bunch of bad-guy thugs backing him up.  They want to force Ben Affleck to help them commit a crime.  It gets more and more complicated.  Eventually there are five criminals all dressed up like Santa Claus with the intention of robbing a casino.
The plot moved swiftly.  It wasn't hard to follow.  Especially since the characters all took turns holding a gun to Ben Affleck's head and explaining how our supposed hero was set-up yet again.  Then, the plot would deepen. And deepen.  There were a few violent scenes and some bloodshed.  And then even more explanations.
I kept watching Ben Affleck's facial expressions, which never seemed to change no matter what happened to him. Charlize
Theron is pretty and never missed a chance to show off her body but her acting ability is on a par with Affleck's.  Gary Sinise was better; he's a good actor and this part called for overacting.  And so what we got was a villain who was just too bad to be true.

Theron gave an impressive performance as the mysterious, yet sweet...pen pal of Affleck's cell mate.  The movie had me interested until the final act which turned into a typical pier six brawl.  Two stars for the movie and one extra star for Theron and Signaw, Michigan.
Oh, the movie is supposed to take place in Michigan, but I don't think any of it was filmed there.  The movie doesn't  really name any Michigan landmarks, so I'm going to assume Affleck is released from Jackson State prison at the begining of the film, travels someplace down river Detroit, let say Wyandotte, to hook up with Theron.  From there he heads up north to rob the casino in say Mount Pleasant, or someplace off US-27.

The opening sequence with the dead Santa Clauses from an aerial view is orignial; and the film then rewinds in flashback.  The snow-filled scenes of December are well-shot.  Ben Affleck as Rudy Duncan is a well scrubbed prisoner who seems neither worldly nor criminal.  When he tells Ashley, ""I had better sex in prison,"" one sees neither the experience nor the emotional scars.  I saw the film in theatrical release and was firmly convinced that the movie starred Ashley Judd.  I was about 45 minutes into the picture when I said to my wife, ""That's not Ashley Judd; that's the woman from 'Sweet November.'""  Charlize Theron is beautiful.  Her ability to deceive only comes clear as the plot unfolds; we don't really sense the a deep mysterious layer; so it doesn't all hang together, for me.  But I loved the moment when Rudy is on his knees in the snow, about to be shot, and he tells her how Nick (prison mate) loved her.  She looks at him knowingly and says something like, ""Who wouldn't?""  It's at that moment that we can hate her.  The problem, of course, is who do we like?  James Frain as Nick is sensitive and seems also out-of-place in the prison, plus hard to believe in the ending.  It was nice to see Mod Squad's tv show Clarence Williams III as a bank robber.  Gary Sinise was good as the bumbling villain.  Dennis Farina as Jack Bangs the casino owner has great moments laying bloodied on the table keeps repeating, ""I can't go back to Vegas.""  The fact that he's been beaten, laying on a table at gunpoint, and still worried about his job security is humorous at an unlikely moment.  Ehren Kruger's script is so full of plot twists and turns that it is like a roller coaster ride in that you're never sure what's coming next; however, the roller coaster does seem to get off track a bit.

1091535,3,6305949662,"After trashing ""Pearl Harbor"" last year and ""The Sum of All Fears"" this year, I felt the pangs of guilt telling me I was picking on local boy Ben Affleck.  Therefore, to appease my conscience, I decided to review a Ben Affleck film I enjoy - John Frankenheimer's ""Reindeer Games"".

""Reindeer Games"" is just about the most unremarkable, low-stakes thriller you could ever expect to see, featuring all the obvious twists, all the obvious turns, and set in locations and in pursuit of prizes that do not exactly get the viewer buzzing with excitement.  What makes the film work, in its own modest way, are the director and the cast.

Frankenheimer is covering old territory here, but it is like watching a veteran baseball player at the plate or in the field - you've seen it a thousand times before but it is still fun to watch.  Frankenheimer knows how to edit his films just right, and he always gets a kinky, dark edge out of all his scripts.  ""Reindeer Games"" is no exception, and one of the DVD bonus features regarding differences between the film and this director's cut really lays out why Frankenheimer should be allowed to present the material as he sees fit.  The film has just enough jarring moments that, even though you've seen the typical twists and betrayals before, Frankenheimer keeps it compelling and interesting.

The cast, too, rises above the pedestrian heist plot, tackling the film enthusiastically.  The movie does not ask them to do too much, so they have fun with what they have.  Ben Affleck goes into smartmouth mode, familiar territory, but puts it to amusing use as a criminal roped into doing a job he wants no part of.  One of the more amusing repeat gags involves his quest for some pecan pie, either a subtle nod or lift of Bruce Willis' cappucino quest in ""Hudson Hawk"".  Charlize Theron is alternating sweet and petulent as his would-be girlfriend.  Gary Sinise, Clarence Williams, and Danny Trejo are good, menacing fun as the heavies.  Perhaps the biggest fun is Dennis Farina hamming it up as the casino manager who brings Vegas-style class by operating a bar that offers both Coke and Pepsi.

A film like ""Reindeer Games"" moves along quickly.  It has to or the inertia will allow the viewer to realize just how silly the film is.  Frankenheimer keeps the film busy enough to keep the viewer curious and engaged, while the cast does a good job of providing enough quirks and quality performances so that the film isn't forgotten two seconds after the credits start rolling.  ""Reindeer Games"" is not deep, ambitious, or original, but it is a comfortable and quality cover of heist films past.",1023235200,19,2630,4.742857142857143

Of course I like Ben, he is such a good looking young man so I would watch anything he makes.  I watch this movie at least once a week, along with Bounce and Pearl Harbor.

1091537,3,6305949662,"Reindeer Games is similar to the gritty, cynical thrillers that Hollywood made for several years after W.W.II. This group of movies came to be called film noir. They were less about good guys and bad guys than they were about survivors, and often all the characters had a shady past. Generally there was one character at the end who forced himself or herself to finally do the right thing. These movies were not sexist. The women were at least as cunning and calculating as the men. After all, in nature the female is frequently better than the male at catching her prey.
Ben Affleck plays Rudy Duncan, a small time thief who is just finishing up a prison sentence. His cell mate and best friend has been corresponding with an attractive woman named Ashley [Charlize Theron], one of those people who like to write to inmates. The relationship has gotten hot and heavy - on paper, that is. Ashley is to meet him when he and Rudy are to be released. Just days before getting out, Rudy's buddy is apparently killed in a melee in the prison cafeteria. When he gets out Rudy sees Ashley outside the prison. Against his better judgment, he walks up to her and allows her to believe he is the dead friend. A passionate love affair soon begins, and all is well until Gabriel [Gary Sinese], Ashley's evil and dangerous brother, shows up with some of his partners in crime. With Ashley screaming in the background, they rough Rudy up and demand that he help them rob the casino he used to work in. The problem is that he never worked there. They think he's the friend. If he helps them, he's in trouble because he doesn't have the information, but if he convinces them he's not who that think he is, he's in even bigger trouble.
What follows is an elaborate cat and mouse game. Rudy is not the only one who is not who he appears to be. The plot is most improbable, but veteran director John Frankenheimer, who helmed the fantastic spy thriller The Manchurian Candidate in 1962, knows how to keep the suspense up and running. The thrills and surprises overcome much of the story's deficiencies.
Gary Sinese is perfect as Gabriel. This talented actor gets into the part so much that it's hard to recognize him at first. Charlize Theron is good as Ashley, a woman whose special talent lays in manipulating men. Ben Affleck is comfortable in a role much like a couple of others he has played in the past.",1016409600,2,2390,4.534722222222222

I watched it so many times the tape turned out to be so scratched up. With my own money I went to the local video store and bought the DVD of Reindeer Games. Without knowing, I had bought the Director's Cut and when I was watching it I was like, ""Whoa! This is new."" I like the Director's Cut better becuz you see Ben's great tattoos, he gets hit with 5 darts instead of 2, and Ben gets a bigger attitude towards Charlize in the movie. He hecka yells at her! I was laughing at that part. I love this movie. Both the original theatrical and the Director's Cut! On the Director's Cut, they even show the original scenes as Bonus Material. So you still have the other scenes. I love this and I'll probably end up ruining the DVD too, but Ben's worth it.",1009411200,2,1035,4.029126213592233
1091539,4,6305949662,"From suspense director journeyman John Frankenheimer who has brought us classics like ""52 Pick-Up"" and the ""Manchurian Candidate,"" comes an implausible, yet entertaining film.

My favorite of the recent stars of the silver screen, Ben Affleck, plays Casey.  Casey is in prison for stealing cars.  His cellmate Rudy has a beautiful lady  pen-pal named Ashley (Charlize Theron, ""Devil's Advocate"") who he's waiting to be with upon his release.

During an ""Animal House"" meets the big house food fight in the jail cafeteria, Rudy is killed by an angry con.  Upon Casey's release,  he impersonates Rudy so HE can be with Ashley.  Everything is fine until Gabriel, played by a viciously evil Gary Sinise shows up as Ashley's surprise brother.  Gabriel has his own agenda for the jailhouse pen-pal little sis has been cultivating.  Thinking that Casey is Rudy, and has worked in a nearby casino, Gabriel kidnaps Casey, and forces him to use the knowlegde he thinks he posesses, to participate in robbing the casino.  The problem is, Casey said he was Rudy, and now he can't prove he isn't.  Unwittingly, Casey has gotten himself in way over his handsome head.  Gabriel and his three cohorts (including Clarence Williams the third, reprising his demented ""Bobby"" role from Frankenhemers ""52 Pick-Up"") will drag Casey on the road in Gabriels trucking rig, and it will be a rough journey indeed.

This movie has a definite bleakness about it, despite the fine performances, direction and great cast.  There is virtually NO atmosphere herein.  Between all the time first spent inside jail, followed by hotel rooms, the truck, and casinos, it's downright claustrophobic.  Despite that aspect, it's still highly entertaining, albeit hardly plausible.

I did find the ending a good surprise, although the actual plot resolution again, too convoluted to be believed. Even so, a film that is able to keep you watching for the whole running time without boring you, is worth seeing.  Movies don't HAVE to be believable, that's frequently the reason we ""escape"" to the movies, isn't it?

When viewing ""Reindeer Games"" enjoy it for what it is, an exciting plot twister that WILL keep you guessing.",1008806400,,2179,5.067415730337078
1091591,2,6305949662,"Reindeer Games just didn't fly well with me.  There are about a zillion reasons, but I'll condense.
First, the acting.  The acting is what makes or breaks a movie.  And the performances in this movie shattered it.  OK, so Ben Affleck makes one good movie, and I'm using good loosely here.  Does that mean he should be offered starring roles? No.  Does it mean we can forgive him for making such garbage? No!  Likewise, Gary Sinise wasn't all that great as the villain.  He just wasn't believable.  And that kind of ties into what I'll talk about next.
The plot and script.  Typically, a movie these days is going to have a few plot holes in it.  But, to have hole after hole after hole just isn't going to cut it.  And some of the things that happened just were not believable.  Tires do not squeal on snow.  Semis don't growl like Lions.  When you fall into a hole, the first place you're going to try to climb back out of is the hole that you fell into!  These types of things overshadowed any attempt the movie made at making a smart, creative plot.
Reindeer Games was an action/romance/suspense/prison flick that had all the elements, but just didn't bring home the bacon.  2 Stars",1008460800,2,1185,4.462616822429907
1091592,3,6305949662,"I saw this movie merely because I was in the mood for an action movie.  John Frankenheimer's ""Reindeer Games"" is an entertaining but forgettable action picture.
After being released from prison, car thief Ben Affleck assumes the identity of ill-fated cellmate James Frain in order to make a pass at the woman(Charlize Theron) that Frain met through a prisoner-pen pal correspondence program.  By posing as Frain, Affleck ultimately finds himself being forced into participating in a robbery planned by Theron's ""brother""(Gary Sinise).
Frankenheimer's ""Reindeer Games"" is simply another forgettable action movie.  As a Frankenheimer film, ""RG"" doesn't come close to matching such great films as ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Black Sunday"" yet doesn't quite fall into the ludicrousness of such pictures as ""The Holcroft Covenant"" and ""99 and 44/100% Dead.""  ""RG"" barely manages to be a so-so Frankenheimer film.  The characters are shallow.  Sinise's villain is actually slightly more interesting than Affleck's hero.  With his scant frame and weaselly features, Sinise is slowly becoming one of the greater villains of present-day cinema.  A few violent action sequences hardly help to make the film any more exciting or interesting.  The last third of the film is saved by a fairly good twist-ending.
Frankenheimer's ""RG"" is not much more than a passable time killer.",1004832000,2,1369,5.419811320754717

He's over-rated, and can only play about one character... my guess is he's not acting, that's just who he is, and every now and then a script fits his personality very well. This script is so bad that it doesn't matter who is in it... the movie just stinks.",998784000,2,409,4.466666666666667

But I came out pretty pleased. This is not a great film. But it's well paced, suspenseful, and boasts some good plot twists.
The acting by Affleck and Sinese is top rank. Theron doesn't so much act as provide delicious eye candy. If you look like Theoron, and you don't have to carry the movie, you get a pass and she gets that pass here.
This is no Arlington Road (a movie that share's the same writer); that is an example of a GREAT movie in this suspense-with-clever-plot twists genre. But this movie is a terrific popcorn movie. Sit back and be entertained. Note: be sure you engage your willing suspension of disbelief before starting the movie.

The cast features two top notch performers in Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron.  The rest of the actors are OK, but are more-or-less afterthoughts to this standout tandem.  Affleck is an emerging star who possesses a commanding screen presence normally only afforded by older, more distinguished actors such as Sean Connery & Ed Harris.  Theron proves to be his theatrical equal as she performs with an acting dynamic and erotic allure not seen since Marlene Dietrich.
If you want a film that will stand up to extensive cinematic scrutiny, then this film is probably not for you.  However, if you want a movie that you can sit back, relax & enjoy, then you can't do much better.  Just seeing Affleck & Theron on-screen at the same time is worth the price of the DVD.

1091599,3,6305949662,"""Reindeer Games"" has a Lot going for it, two Flavour of the Year Stars, a Flavour of the Month Screenwriter (Erin Kruger), a Talented Veteran Director (John Frankenhiemer) and the fact that there is Nothing out recently that is Anything Like it (""Best Laid Plans"" would come closest, but did it all Better). It is a Small, Different Crime Thriller, lacking in the Thrills and Effects that Pepper Modern Thrillers, but Full of Old Fashioned Characters given Modern Quirks. The Characters would feel more at home in a 1940's Film Noir. I won't review the Plot as it's Best to let it unfold before your Own Eyes, the More you don't know, the Better.
At it's Best point's, ""Reindeer Games"" manages the Difficult task of being Refreshingly Old fashioned and Slickly Original at the Same Time, at it's Worst points, it is Slow, Boring and a Little Frustrating as it Seems to be Losing it's way. Genre Master Frankenhiemer (""Ronin"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"") Never allows that to happen, but his Usually strong Leash has been Loosened a little.
While I was Disappointed by it's lack of Action and Thrills, I Very Much Enjoyed it's Strange Sense of Humour that Never Seems Intentional. It All comes from Character and there are a Few Points where the film reaches Laugh Out Loud status, which I Never saw Coming (eg. The Motel Bill bit, the references to ""Little Drummer Boy"" and the Pow-Wow Safe bit). The Dialogue is also a High point, while the script may Lag and Drift here and there, the Dialogue never does. There is No Denying that Kruger isn't a Talented Writer, and while he gives us just enough to stay Interested in his Young Career, he needs to Show us more of his ""Arlington Road"" Originality. ""Reindeer Games"" has a Bit of that films Originality, it also shares it Realism, and both films are Well Grounded in Reality. The Biggest difference between the films is their Endings, while One has one of the Best Endings Ever Witnessed; the Other has one of the Worst, see below for Details.
The Usually Strong cast are in Good (but not Great) form, their Characters let them down and they have to cop the Brunt of Audience Hatred. It's the Fault of Kruger's Screenplay that has it's characters Moods Swing as often as a Gun is Drawn. It is hard to care for a character that you just don't Understand, if their Behaviour and Moods are so Irrational, you simply Can't get Attached. Ben Afflict is Likeable here, Annoying there as Rudy, our would be Hero. His Performance is good, but you won't be Biting your nails about weather he'll Live or Die. Charlize Theron has Scarcely given a performance that I haven't Loved, this performance is among he Worst, she starts out Great, but Falls Apart as the film Progresses, which was Quite a Shock as I've Never thought that I would like to see Less of her. Gary Sinese is the films Saving Grace when it comes to Performances. He seems to want to Make Up for his Lousy Bad Guy Performance in ""Snake Eyes"" (or maybe his lousy Good Guy Performance in ""Mission to Mars""). Even though he is the Villain of the piece, I cared about him the Most and I even found myself Willing him to Win the day.
""Reindeer Games"" also features a Much Talked about ending (much talked about in the Negative sense). It's not so much an ""Average Thriller"" ending; it's more a ""Below Average Horror"" ending. Being that Erin Kruger also wrote ""Scream 3"" I'm not really surprised, but then again he wrote ""Arlington Road""... Now I'm Outraged. For Many, this ending will Make or Break the film for you, while I saw it coming and wasn't very Phased by it, I fear it will cause More Breakings than it will Makings.",991094400,,3632,4.5892307692307694

The story has been rehashed by many other reviewers, so I'll spare any more.  I do believe that it is an entertaining film, although certainly not in the league of ""Manchurian.""  However, suspend disbelief, and get caught up in the sizzling plot and twists.  Ben Affleck is a likeable, if not believable, hero, and I'm really happy about how he ends up.  Charlize Theron is delightfully wicked in her role as the sweet and innocent (hah!) Ashley.  Gary Sinise is effectively slimy as the villain, but if he goes overboard, it does help you hate him even more.  Also good in a minor role is Dennis Farina as the owner of a Michigan Indian casino, who wants to go back to Las Vegas.

Replete with a bad script and bad acting, it revolves around a convoluted plot that has so many twists and turns, as to simply not be believable. The casting is bad, as well. Ben Affleck as a hardened convict? Come on...give me a break! He is simply not a good enough actor to play against type, charming though he be.
Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck), a professional car thief who has just spent six years in the can, is looking forward to being released and returning to his family for Xmas. His cell mate of six years, Nick, is likewise looking forward to his own simultaneous release, so that he can join his beautiful girl friend and pen pal, Ashley (Charlize Theron), about whom he has talked to Rudy incessantly for years and to whom he has read all her letters. Unfortunately, two days before Nick's and Rudy's release, Nick is stabbed, ostensibly to death.
When Rudy leaves prison, he sees the beautiful Ashley waiting for Nick. Having heard all about her for years and feeling like he knows her, Rudy assumes Nick's identity, and hooks up with her. Unbeknownst to Rudy, Ashley has an evil brother (Gary Sinise). When Rudy meets him, somewhat unceromoniously, he forces Rudy to become part of a casino robbery, because he believe Rudy to be Nick and is counting on Nick's prior knowledge of the casino to help them plot the robbery. When Rudy confesses to not being Nick, Sinise does not believe him, and Rudy is forced to use his wits to stay alive.
However, the twists and turns continue. If you think the brother is evil, the viewer finds out that he has nothing on his sister, Ashley. Unfortunately, it gets so unbelievable, as to be ludicrous, and the movie spirals out of control. Like I said, it's so bad, it's funny. Rent it, Don't buy it.",981936000,10,1912,4.577259475218659

1091797,2,6305949662,"This movie was just terrible.  The acting is the worst that I have seen  out of all of the actors.  It's not because they are bad actors, it is  because they were given such terrible dialogue to work with.  Ben Affleck's  character didn't know whether to be tough or scared.  It was just so up and  down, that it seemed like he was playing two characters.  A wimp and a  tough guy.  It didn't make sense.  The only reason that I gave the movie 2  instead of one stars is because it had a little surprise at the end that I  didn't expect. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time.  I  wouldn't even advise renting it, let alone buying it.",969321600,,645,4.121951219512195
1091798,1,6305949662,"First i am going to start out by saying that John Frankinheimer is a great  director and great at creating plot twists a la The Manchurian Candidate  and Last years Ronin. Now with the movie Ben Affleck stars in the title  role as a con who is soon to get out of prison in a couple of days and on  the outside is lovely Charlize theron waiting for him after Rudy's(Affleck)  cell mate wrote letters to her from prison when he was killed Rudy goes as  his dead cell mate. But on the out side he gets invloved is  Ashley's(Theron) brothers casino heist plan. Gabriel played by Gary Sinise  who is cooking this plan for this floundering michigan casino. So Rudy gets  invloved.
Coming from Screenwriter Ethren Kruger and John Frakinheimer  you would expect something more thrilling. But this movie was sh shallow  mainly because of the weak script and thin plotting and wasting good  talent. The more you watch of this movie you begin to scoff in disbelief  and the twists are so predictibable. Another problem is with the casting of  Ben Affleck who is generally a good actor but as an action he has to mature  because he has a goofy charm to him that is not ment for action roles. To  sum it all up Reindeer Games is a BIG LUMP OF COAL",969062400,,1234,4.393805309734513
1091799,1,6305949662,"This movie should be in the comedy section, because I found myself  laughing at it more than being thrilled at it. The characters are just  plain stupid, mostly Gary Sinese (whenever I see him with long hair I  always think of him without legs...not a very threatening villian I must  say). The plot twists are obvious, and stupid. Bad acting, bad script, BAD  MOVIE!!!",968457600,,369,4.703125
1091800,3,6305949662,"I realize that when you watch a film there is a need to suspend disbelief,  but this film is ridiculous.  This story has more holes than a colander and  it gets more ludicrous as it progresses.
It starts out well plausibly  enough.  Upon release from prison, Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) impersonates  his cellmate Nick (James Frain) in order to get with Ashley (Chalene  Theron), his lovely pen-pal girlfriend.  After a short frolic, Ashley's  evil brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and his thugs kidnap Rudy, thinking he  is Nick.  It seems Nick once worked as a security guard in a casino that  the thugs want to rob.  The film is intriguing to here, but a succession of  dubious situations and plot twists mar what started out as a good  setup.
Ehren Kruger has given us some good scripts (Scream 3, Arlington  Road), but in this story he tried to be a little too clever and it bombed.  There was a lot of exceptionally bad dialogue.  There were so many holes in  the plot, Kruger felt compelled to try to patch it up with explanatory  dialogue near the end.  The ending was so far beyond inconceivable that it  bordered on moronic.
Director John Frankenheimer did a very nice job with  the camera, giving us a great variety of innovative perspective shots, and  pacing the film well.  The action scenes and stunts were also well  done.
The acting was terrific by the entire cast.  It is a pity that they  didn't have better material.  Gary Sinise was nefarious and slimy as  Ashley's evil brother.  Chalize Theron was wonderfully duplicitous as  Ashley, all dewy eyed with Rudy at first, then playing the helpless victim,  and later as the cold-hearted woman with the pistol in her hand.  That was  quite a range and she was fabulous in just about every scene.  Ben Affleck  might have been a little too nice to be Rudy.  Though he was only a car  thief, he just didn't seem much like a convict.  Still, he has good screen  presence, and he carried the role off pretty well.
I rated this film a  6/10.  I subtracted three points for the dubious plot and another point for  the absurd ending.  The acting and directing were marvelous, but the story  was so flawed that it couldn't be redeemed.",968198400,,2190,4.5859375
1091893,4,6305949662,"I really enjoyed this movie  because of the plot twists throughout. Ben  Affleck is great as the innocent bystander. My heart goes out to the casino  boss who ""don`t wanna go back to Vegas""!Again it is a great movie  with a fast paced script...come December i will be looking over my shoulder  at the street Santa Clauses......HO HO HO",968198400,,335,4.610169491525424
1091894,4,6305949662,"A few of the reviews of ""Reindeer Games"", mostly negative ones,  refer to it mistakenly as an action picture.  I don't agree with that  characterization.  This is more like a good crime drama, with a little bit  of action here and there.
Ben Affleck portrays a prisoner who along with  his cellmate is ready to leave prison.  When the cellmate unexpectedly  dies, Affleck takes his place and meets a woman (Charlize Theron) with whom  the cellmate had a ""pen pal"" relationship.  He is soon  unwillingly recruited by her brother (Gary Sinise) to assist in a casino  robbery.
The plot was interesting and has more than a few unexpected  and somewhat implausible plot twists, but it nevertheless entertains.  Director John Frankenheimer's stock in trade is taut political dramas such  as ""Seven Days in May"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"",  which typically don't feature much gunplay or violence, and the violence in  this film is certainly restrained compared to what one would normally  expect to see in a motion picture of this nature.  This may be what some  viewers found so disappointing.
The acting was good all around.  Sinise,  in particular, shines as a malevolent truck driver with just a hint of  Charlie Manson.  Performances like this leave little doubt as to why he's  one of the best supporting actors in motion pictures.  Dennis Farina, also  a favorite of mine, is very good as a disenfranchised casino manager.
I  recommend ""Reindeer Games"", but not as a ""shoot-em-up""  good-guy bad-guy movie like ""Die Hard"".",968112000,,1525,4.988
1091895,4,6305949662,"Ben Affleck is a really likeable star.  He's goofy, good-looking, and gritty all at once.  REINDEER GAMES is by no means a sophisticated  thriller, but it is a fun one.
Ben (our hero) starts out in prison for  stealing cars.  He indirectly falls in love with his prison-mate's  letter-writing girlfriend.  At first I thought this movie was going to be a  love story.  The first 20 minutes is about how Ben and Charlize Theron's  character meet and fall in love.  It's cute.
Then the action kicks in.  The movie is slick and fast paced.  We meet Gary Sinise's sinister  character.  He's sexy and slimy all at once (with some major bags under his  eyes!  Affleck is forced to lie about his identity.  This plot development  is fun, but the believability of it gets pushed when Theron's character  doesn't seem to have any sort of emotional reaction to who Affleck REALLY  is.
But why quibble?  REINDEER GAMES is a blast.  Although it telegraphs  its ending in the first scene (I hate that!) it's still fun getting to the  end.  There are surprises and explosions.  And the scenery is very cool (is  it Michigan? ).
I wasn't blown away by the extra's on this disc, however  I won't complain because DVD extra's beat VHS any day!
Enjoy this film.  I did.",967161600,5,1250,4.575342465753424
1091896,3,6305949662,"Sorry for being a sexist pig, but anything that has Charlize Theron topless gets at least a C- rating in my book, but the movie holds up pretty  good as well.
Rudy Duncan (Affleck) is in jail.  His roomie is Nick  Cassidy who is head over heels with his penpal girlfriend Ashley, whom he  has never met.  Nick tells Rudy everything and they are good buddies.  However, he is killed a few days before Rudy and he are set to be released.  Now Rudy, with the knowledge of Nick's past can go home and be with his  family for Christmas, or he can be a creep and hook up with Ashley, fooling  her, tricking her and conning her.  If you have seen Charlize in other  movies, you know that Rudy makes the right move (even if he KNEW the  outcome of the next 48 hours, he made the right move).
So with Ashley  as his new girlfriend, everything seems right...Right?  Nope, enter  Ashley's crazy brother Gabriel (Gary Sinese was a little miscast for this  role but takes it on well). Unfortunately Ashley told him that the jailbird  once worked for a reservation Casino and now Gabe wants to rob it and he  needs Rudy as his inside man.  Problem is, it was Nick who worked there and  Rudy only has the information.  If our protagonist enters the casino, no  one will know who he is, and that means he's a dead man.
That is about  2/3 of the plot, but there are twists and turns that will seem logical, but  are far fetched in real life.  It is like the movie ""THE GAME""  where Michael Douglas is put in this situation which the writer and  director tries to explain with reason, but are unbelievable because no one  can control that situation to 100% authority.  But if you can suspend your  disbelief, this is a better than average action movie.
Frankenheimer,  veteran action movie director with titles like ""The Manchurian  Candidate"", ""The French Connection 2"" and ""Ronin""  does a good job keeping the action heavy, yet the tone light.  Even the  ending (which was disappointing) had the right amount of action and  believability that one could believe the explanation which that unfolds  that explains the whole point of the movie.
Affleck does his usual  sarcastic, stoic type that seems to appeal to many people and Charlize  Theron pulls a nice turn and the good/bad girl.  However, don't expect any  Oscar nominations.  While good, they are far better actors that what the  script allows for and seem to be coasting through the film.  The only  disappointment was Sinise.
If you are looking for a good action movie  to watch with the gang and don't want a message, lots of meaningful  dialogue or Oscar calibre acting....Reindeer Games is good because it will  fill your daily quota of sex, gunfire, car explosions and bad  jokes...Rating: C+",966988800,2,2739,4.58298755186722

Even viewers who are  not too familiar with the previous works by Afleck, Theron, or Sinise, this  film will surely change any misconceptions about their sometimes underrated  acting abilities; Still cannot figure out how Theron and Afleck can turn on  the waterworks--is it method acting or real emotions--incredibly  believable.  Gary Sinise can play either good or bad flawlessly; If he's a  good character,he's intense. If he's a bad one, he's super-intense !
Also,  appearnaces by Isaac Hayes and Clarence Williams III are an added bonus!  Was wonderin' what Mr. Hayes was up to these days.

John  Frankenheimmer has redeemed himself in my eyes from the dread of watching  last year's Ronin.  While this may not be the smartest or most  action-packed movie, it is a lot better than much of the subpar films  racing through theatres today.  The extras on the disc, commentary and  deleted scenes, make it worth the adding of it to your collection.  One  problem that I did have was the fade-in to the family dinner, which didn't  seem to fit the tone of the film in the way that it was directed.  Another  quirk, albeit minor, is that Affleck's character doesn't ditch his Suit  even after realizing that the Police will be looking for 5 suits, leaving  for a possible manhunt for him.

1091961,4,6305949662,"John Frankenheimer is one of the directors for whom I have the utmost respect. Since the early 60's, he has presented a few masterpieces, dozens  of excellent movies and three or four bad films that I nevertheless  appreciate. When you love someone, you accept the defaults too. With  REINDEER GAMES, this director stays, after the already excellent RONIN, in  the action movie genre and delivers a personal movie with the usual car  explosions and numerous gunfights that today audiences seem to like so  much.
With Ben Affleck, John Frankenheimer has found an actor who, like  James Stewart or Gary Cooper, sixty years ago, has the favour of the public  as soon as he appears on the screen. With a hero like him, you'd better to  choose a great villain. No problem, with Gary Sinise you cannot be wrong,  this actor has got the intensity of a John Malkovitch and the meanness of a  Richard Widmark. When the feminine role is held by such a beauty as  Charlize Theron, you have all the ingredients to cook an explosive  mixture.

Reindeer Games is a joke.  The ""bad  guys"" have the chance to kill Ben Affleck at least four times, yet  they still let him hang around.  Ben Affleck has the opportunity of a  lifetime to escape, yet he breaks into his own hotel room and plays cards  before his captor's realize he's gone.
A review would help by giving you  plot lines.  Just scroll up and read the published review.  Then, scroll  back down to this message and read the subtle reasons the movie is so  bad.
Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron can't act, either of them.  Anna  Nicole Smith has shown better potential than these two idiots.  The  performances just add to the misery as you pull individual hair out of your  scalp and underarms one by one with each passing minute.
