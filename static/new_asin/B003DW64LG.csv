4112290,4,B003DW64LG,"Mindy has great bosu workouts and while this is not my favorite, it is fun and a good workout at the same time.  It is hard to find any bosu DVD's so I was very happy to find that Mindy is a Bosu trainer.  I rented a different one of her Bosu workouts from Netflixx and really liked it, I think it is called Body Blast or something like that.  It was 2x the price of this one, which is why I bought this one.",1331424000,11,408,3.776470588235294
4112291,5,B003DW64LG,"I bought this for the wife and I after we got annoyed with the stock video which comes with the Bosu Ball.

First and foremost- this is an advanced video and contains dizzying, leg-jellying moves which take some practice to get down.  It is an intense workout and if you aren't used to the Bosu Ball or don't use it regularly, this video will pose a good challenge.

Mindy is great- energetic, well-spoken, ripped.  She gets a little over-exuberant with her motions and cues but it's good for a chuckle here and there and nothing distracting.  There is a ""bonus"" part of the DVD which includes a workout that you need a standard workout ball for.

The DVD begins with legs and cardio and then moves into upper body and ab work.  Everything is explained well, the music isn't too annoying yet and the set doesn't look like it's from the '80s.  I would certainly recommend this video to anyone with a Bosu Ball.  It's worth the money.  If you aren't at a fitness level where you can complete the entire thing, it's a great opportunity to pick and choose which exercises you want to do on  given day and mix it up!",1321315200,40,1111,4.4236453201970445
4112292,4,B003DW64LG,This is a great workout!  It's the intensity i was looking for.  Not for beginners.  The only thing i would change is add some stretches in the warm-up period.,1298851200,7,159,4.413793103448276
4112293,5,B003DW64LG,This workout kept my heart rate in the fat burning range. Athletic style moves and full body strength using only the bosu.,1298073600,3,122,4.590909090909091

8395008,4,B003DW64LG,"It's hard to find Bosu workouts, so I was thrilled to see this one. This is an ADVANCED workout, so I would not recommend this one to people who are new to the Bosu. I'm not able to do the entire routine from start-to-finish, but the routines are good and it gives me ideas of different ways to use my Bosu. I don't have many workouts by this trainer-- she's very energetic, but not to the point of being annoying. I did knock off 1 star simply because I think there could have been more description on the cover about the contents of the workout. I really couldn't tell from the Amazon description what kinds of exercises I would be doing, or how the routine would be structured. Also, the background was kind of ""blah"" (it takes place in a locker room)-- kind of a personal bias, but when I'm huffing and puffing, a nice background helps me pretend I'm somewhere else :)  But overall, I like the workout and will continue using the DVD.",1385769600,11,938,4.36
8395009,5,B003DW64LG,"I consider myself very fit - I run, play indoor soccer, do Pilates and I am a Jillian Michaels DVD lover. This DVD had me panting. The first 2/3 of this video is cardio and then it moves into core. That said, it is really a fun, intense workout with a lot of variety!",1363824000,2,267,3.962962962962963
8395010,1,B003DW64LG,"Hard to follow, waaaay to fast paced. She does this for HER enjoyment, not yours. Found many more GOOD routines on You Tube. Sorry to have bought this. BIG mistake!",1361836800,5,164,4.5
8395011,5,B003DW64LG,"This was for my wife, who is a personal trainer and she loves this! Proper footwear is essential, and obviously,  the Bosu.",1356393600,,123,4.590909090909091
