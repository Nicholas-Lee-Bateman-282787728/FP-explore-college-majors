4657628,3,B005DCJ3IA,"The movie opens with some ridiculous bathroom humor as the constipated Belcher (Ryan Dunn) wants his roommate Will (Gerard Haitz) to keep him company, i.e. drink, play cards while he takes ""the Browns to the bowl."" After Belcher dies from constipation, Will's life starts to look up as he dates Belcher's hot cousin Krista. (April Scott). The movie introduces some ""stoners"" who move into Belcher's old room. These characters are very poor copies of ""Bill and Ted."" Their lines and character are forced adding a negative aspect to the film.

The ghost of Belcher returns (no special effects) and wants to hang with Will like old times until Belcher finds out Will is dating Krista.

Ryan plays an excellent Belcher amidst some lack luster performances. He is a clone of Zach Galifianakis. All the lines were written for him. When Ryan Dunn is not on the screen the film is lame. The sound track is Indie and at times didn't match the scene. As the movie progresses, the antics of Ryan become more destructive and the movie loses its humor as it becomes a tragedy.

If you are a fan of Zach Galifianakis type of bizarre humor, then you will find some enjoyment in this film.

4657631,5,B005DCJ3IA,the movie was apparently remade or something because the cover shows the two main characters as ryan dunn and bam margera which will probably make it a better movie because of the chemistry between the two. R.I.P. Ryan Dunn,1312416000,2,223,4.743589743589744

4657644,4,B005DCJ3IA,This was a good friend movie. Didn't know what to expect. Thought Bam might be in it a little more but that it's such a bad thing. Dunn shines in the spotlight. Just a nice all around movie that was easy to get into and talked about the value of your friendships!,1398124800,,263,4.076923076923077

4657662,5,B005DCJ3IA,Anything with Dunn in it is good in my book. If you are a fan of Dunn then this is definitely a movie for you. Don't expect Jackass or anything like that because it does have some of that humor in it but not much. Still great. Dunn shines in this. I miss him.,1359849600,,259,3.814814814814815
4657663,4,B005DCJ3IA,this was a great movie. ryan dunn is hilarious. it was sad watching it knowing he is dead now. the casket scene was hard to watch.,1348272000,,130,4.038461538461538
4657664,1,B005DCJ3IA,"LAME!!!!
 By far on the top 5 of the worst movies I have ever seen. This shit is up there with Broke back mountain. People who make this crap need to be slapped!",1345075200,,161,3.878787878787879
4657665,5,B005DCJ3IA,"Very silly and funny. Although, why is Bam Margera on the cover? He only had a 3 minute cameo as Hillbilly #1. Also, The dog on the cover is not in the movie nor is the chicken haha but all that aside i thought this movie was great. RIP Ryan Dunn.",1341014400,,247,3.8627450980392157
4657666,5,B005DCJ3IA,"I know most ppl won't agree with me but this is the most amazing movie I have ever seen, funny, sad, everything you would ever want in a movie all rolled into one.  Ryan was amazing in this and I will never forget him.",1340928000,,218,3.9545454545454546

4657668,1,B005DCJ3IA,"I watched the 1st 5 minutes of this movie and that was enough! If you have an IQ of 1 you might like it, otherwise, it's crap. It is poorly filmed (like many new movies) and I really couldn't stand watching anybody as retarded as these guys are for more than 5 minutes. It isn't funny, it's just plain stupid. I couldn't see wasting any more time than I already have to continue watching it. I couldn't even bring myself to waste anyone elses time by giving it to them so I threw it in the garbage where it belongs. I thing someone should take everyone involved in the making of this film out back and shoot them in the head so they can't waste anyone's time ever again.",1329004800,,670,4.2015503875969
4657669,5,B005DCJ3IA,"Awesome movie, but don't be mistaken about Bam.  As far as I know this was Dunn's last production, and a hell of a good one.",1327968000,,124,3.96
4657670,2,B005DCJ3IA,"First up, tossing Bam Margera on the cover is so weak considering he's literally in the movie for 4 seconds as a 'bar hobo'. Anything with Dunn is quite funny, but anything with him and anyone else or just anyone else without Dunn is awful and painfully sub-regular. Just bad all around. Imagine any low budget romantic comedy, then replace anything they said with the the most obviously lazy thing ever.

Just an annoyingly bad movie.",1324684800,,435,4.723684210526316
4657671,1,B005DCJ3IA,"I am going to do you a favor by keeping you from wasting your time and money on this movie.  Even if you are bored out of your mind, stay bored and don`t watch this movie.",1319414400,,171,3.75
8466509,5,B005DCJ3IA,"Im a Ryan Dunn fan, so I may be a little biased, but Im glad I bought this. Its a funny movie and puts him in the spotlight one last time and because of that it makes appreciate it more. In the special features they even do a nice little bit for Dunn.

The movie came in perfect condition and had no issues. It was at a fair price as well.",1525219200,,339,3.7746478873239435

8466516,4,B005DCJ3IA,"My boyfriend loves this movie, I can admit I do like it. It has some pretty funny moments and laughs throughout the movie. I was happy I could actually find this movie to buy. Since it seems like any store I try to buy it at does not sell it. Or they say they never even heard of this movie. I'm glad I found it and glad I bought it. My boyfriend will be so happy on Xmas opening this, I can't wait!!",1419292800,,400,3.8313253012048194
8466517,4,B005DCJ3IA,"I recently had discovered this movie and so I decided that since I have everything else Bam or Ryan have been in that I would try this out.

It's the typical humor (d**k and fart jokes) you would see from Ryan and Bam as well. Bam only makes a short cameo during a bar scene.
Basically the story is that Ryan's character passes away and his roommate and best friend starts seeing his cousin, whom he meets at the funeral. Ryan's character is not having it and as a ghost, haunts his former roomie and tries to sabotage his relationship with every chance he gets.

Ryan's acting is actually pretty good. It's a shame he was taken too soon. I think he may have had the potential to be in bigger movies some day.",1419292800,,709,4.2835820895522385
