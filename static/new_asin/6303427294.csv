644608,4,6303427294,"I agree with the other reviewers, my only complaint is with the quality of the dvd. It is overly dark in some scenes, and the sound at times is hard to hear. Over all it is worth purchasing when you consider the price. The film contains stock footage from several Paramount movies including the Gary Cooper version entitled Fighting Caravans.",1127088000,17,342,4.716666666666667
644609,5,6303427294,"Great wagon train epic.  Randolph Scott gets great support from many fine actors including sidekicks Raymond Hatton and Olin Howland.  Fantastic theme song that will stick in your mind for days.  A woman hating scout (Scott) and his two sidekicks lead a wagon train of easterners into Indian country.  Major action scenes, pictures of the majestic wagons, romance, and Monte Blue as a half-breed villain you'll not soon forget.  This is one you'll watch again and again.",978307200,35,470,5.0519480519480515
644610,5,6303427294,"A well made film from 1934, this movie has everything a good western should have:  a good guy wearing the white hat and a bad guy wearing the black, chivalry, campfire songs, humor, and a great cowboys v. indians  shootout.  This movie was ahead of it's time in 1934, and a pioneer to  great westerns and action films that followed.  This is a classic that was  influential and should not be forgotten.",946425600,23,402,4.513888888888889
644669,3,6303427294,"This was a shortened version of Grey's Fighting Caravans which had been done in 1931 starring Gary Cooper.  That one was over 90 minutes long and this version done in 1934 starred up and coming Randolph Scott and was only 56 minutes.  A B version of Caravans using a lot of the stock footage.  Still Scott did a good job as the youngest of the three scouts leading a wagon train west to Oregon.  Monte Blue played the main villain Murdock a half breed who hated whites, but passed as white, who kept the tribes attacking the wagon train in a attempt to stop them from pressing West.  Worth a watch and western fans, especially of the early western fans, will enjoy this one.",1421798400,5,674,4.403225806451613

644671,1,6303427294,Do not purchase this movie from Amazon.  Video quality is terrible; screen picture is constantly jumping.  Does not advertise that this is a black and white movie.  Problem is that you don't know the issues until you open the box and put the movie in the DVD player - too late to return then.  Poor advertising from Amazon!!,1412553600,2,324,4.5344827586206895

644674,4,6303427294,"Wagon Wheels, 1934 film

The background to the credits has a picture of James K. Polk to date this around 1846. They talk about the settlement of Oregon. Nan wanted to go to Oregon. A family will leave Indiana, there is another from Tennessee. All hope for a better life in Oregon. They travel in a wagon train for mutual help and society. Each immigrant will get two sections of land for free. A single woman is rejected because she does not have the right equipment, a heavy wagon. Will this migration affect the fur traders? Will they try to stop it? The wagon train leaves Missouri on the Oregon Trail. [This film shows horses and mules. The real wagon trains used oxen, more powerful than horses and they could live off vegetation that would starve a horse. There was no tabu against eating cattle.] This group left on May 1, the traditional start of summer when grass was provided fodder for draft animals. Miss Abigail sings.

Men guard the wagons at night. The Santa Fe stage whizzes by at 6 miles an hour. This wagon train goes 12 miles all day. Roving bands of Indians attack them. One scout knows the arrow is not from a local Indian tribe. Some talk about turning back, but they will push on. They reach the snowy Rocky Mountains. ""He's the sole survivor of that party."" They descend the western side of the Rockies. Murdock arranges an attack on the wagon train. They heavy rains stops travel. Mud. But they must push on now. When they cross the river the Indians attack. [Note the use of post-Civil War pistols and rifles.] The wagon train fights off the attack. They arrive in Oregon at last. They must file on their claims for two sections of land. The Federal government helped people then. ""But Abby, I can't write."" They will stake their claims. There will be a happy ending in this new country.

""Jim Burch"" was a bearded Raymond Hatton, better known in the ""Rough Riders"" series with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy. No comment on those two sisters. This was adapted from Zane Grey's novel ""Fighting Caravans"". It is a condensed and simplified version.",1291161600,8,2066,4.578378378378378

7846789,2,6303427294,"Of real interest only to those interested in the history of cinema.  This very early Randolph Scott film is in very poor condition.  The print is dark and muddy.  The sound quality is also very poor.  All of this is really a shame.  Current technology would permit a high degree of restoration of both the image and sound, but apparently no one was willing to spend the money.

The storyline is simple and obvious.  Supposedly set in 1846, the costumes are largely anachronistic, as are many of the weapons shown.  Racial attitudes are clear and repellent: Indians are savages and ""half breeds"" are worse.  The trip west, supposedly one of the first wagon trains to the Oregon territories, was by the standards of the time, remarkably uneventful.  In reality, a great many settlers, lured by the promise of free land did not survive these trips.  2000 miles by wagon without roads or even clear trails meant enormous struggle.  Little of this is seen in the film.",1498521600,2,963,4.734939759036145
