3618859,5,B001GPOTGE,"'The True Story of Killing Pablo' is a fascinating History Channel documentary based on the Mark Bowden best selling book of the same name. Bowden himself is interviewed on this DVD and tells the tale of how the U.S. & Colombian governments teamed up to bring down the world's deadliest drug lord. The story plays out like a Hollywood crime thriller and will have you on the edge of your seat, even if you already know the outcome. A major motion picture is being planned with Spanish actor, Javier Bardem being considered for the role of Escobar.",1270512000,5,547,4.649484536082475

8306608,5,B001GPOTGE,"As all the other reviewers have commented so far, this is an excellent DVD.  The book on which it is based is well researched.  Pablo Escobar was a monstrously evil man, and if more people knew about his life, he would surely overtake many other more famous criminals like Al Capone in the public memory of wickedness.  He was probably responsible for as many as 15,000 deaths, and just one of his assassins claimed 3,000 - as many as in the 9/11 attacks.  At his height, according to a revised Forbes estimate, he had a net worth of $9 billion. Long after Escobar's death, his evil influence still casts a long shadow on Colombia in its politics, and patterns of crime and violence.

No other criminal ever was able to kill two ministers of justice, the attorney general, the leading presidential candidate (along with other candidates), the most well-known newspaper editor, the head of the national anti-narcotics agency, and so many others who dared to speak the truth about him or tried to bring him to justice.  He arranged for training of his dynamiters by an ETA bomb specialist from Spain, paid renegade Israeli military experts to have his squads of killers trained in terror and assassination.  Escobar trafficked cocaine to the U.S. from wherever he could - Lehder's private island in the Bahamas, Castro's Cuba, Mexico, the Sandinistas' Nicaragua. The head of the Colombian FBI (the DAS) in his time was later charged with conniving in the assassination of the leading presidential candidate in 1989.

He hired a guerrilla group to attack the Supreme Court of Colombia, kill the judges who would rule on extraditing him, and destroy all the records.  At the same time, he paid the military commander of the tank regiment in the capital to attack the Supreme Court, supposedly to save the hostages, but actually to kill the guerrillas themselves and all other possible witnesses.  (This commander is also now in prison for ""disappearing"" captives his regiment supposedly rescued.) When one of Escobar's associates, the Medellin Cartel drug barons Carlos Lehder, became increasingly unstable and paranoid (on coke), Escobar arranged for a tip-off so he could be seized and extradited, reducing the risks for himself.

Escobar paid huge amounts to politicians - including for presidential campaigns, starting in 1982, slept with leading models and beauty queens, and gave public declarations on radio as though he were a head of state making war and peace.  Patiently and ruthlessly, he bribed, kidnapped, and killed to successfully get the elected Congress dissolved, an obedient Constituent Assembly in place, and a clause inserted in the new Constitution to outlaw the only punishment he feared - extradition to the U.S.

It's fascinating to see what happened from this point in 1991, and his triumphant one-year stay by agreement with the government and with the approval of the President in a resort-type lodge he built on his own property, protected by Colombian police in his pay. He continued trafficking, killing, and torturing those he had brought to him.  Within 18 months after Escobar walked out of his ""prison"" in June 1992, he was dead - shot like a rabid cur after being hunted by his enemies in the Cali Cartel, Colombian and U.S. forces, and his own former subordinates who turned against him and helped track him down by putting pressure on his family and shooting down his lawyers, accountant, and associates. This was only fitting for a man who had tortured children and killed them with his own hands according to ""Popeye"" - his former assassin who got religion in prison.

A former president of the Colombian senate (Alberto Santofimio) was Escobar's ally and is now serving a jail term.  The Godfather of Colombian politics and former president (1974-78), Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, was repeatedly in negotiations with Escobar - starting with his own failed campaign for a second term when he reportedly received over $300,000 - as much as his party's entire campaign budget.  The President of Colombia in 2002-10, Alvaro Uribe, was connected to Pablo Escobar through his father's drug ties and in his early public career as Director of Civil Aviation (when Escobar got permits for his planes and landing strips) and Mayor of Medellin.

To the extent Colombia became a ""narco-democracy"" as a former DEA agent (Joe Toft) called it, Escobar was the father of this new country.  To the hoodlums of Medellin who became killers and masters of wealth with lots of women at their disposal, and the poor who benefited from his charity and gifts of money, houses, and furniture, he was ""El Patron"" (the Boss).  To many simple people he was a saint - his tomb is still a site of pilgrimage.  It doesn't occur to those who adore this local boy, who became so rich and powerful, that he was a criminal who profited from the sufferings of those addicted to his product.  They believe he was unfairly persecuted by politicians and Americans, because he stood up to them.",1346457600,2,4988,4.9413875598086126
