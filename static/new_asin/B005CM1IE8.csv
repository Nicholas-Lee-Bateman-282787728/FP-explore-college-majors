8465635,4,B005CM1IE8,"Lovely dancer, beautiful ballerina.  Her work is displayed with an eye to the viewer's pleasure, and her history is presented succinctly, but with warmth.  I enjoyed the video, and would recommend it to balletomanes everywhere.",1350345600,,227,5.457142857142857
8465636,3,B005CM1IE8,"I found this to be an interesting story about the career of Paloma. We hear from
some of her coaches. There are comments from the artistic director of ABT. I would
have liked much more footage of Paloma dancing in a live performance in front of
an audience. We only get about 10 minutes. This dvd is good but not essential.",1345161600,3,323,4.311475409836065
8465637,4,B005CM1IE8,"This is an interesting background look at the life of a professional ballerina. More rehearsal than performance but when she performs, it's magic. The woman has feet like butter!",1327190400,2,178,5.172413793103448
8465638,3,B005CM1IE8,"This documentary looks like it was originally done for TV in Argentina.  Although it has English subititles where needed, I found the constant going back and forth between English and Spanish to be distracting.  That said, it follows Ms. Herrera's career from her start in South America to her, now, over ten year career with ABT.  There are some nice scenes of the dancer being coached for various roles, but the photography isn't terribly well placed. She finishes behind a pillar in a number of the scenes.  I would have liked to see more performance footage.  I'd rather have gotten this DVD at the library than paid for it.",1320624000,11,628,4.724770642201835
