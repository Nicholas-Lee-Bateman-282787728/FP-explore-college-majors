7945085,5,B00005M2H9,"I liked the episodes in this video. The first one was Indigo Angels where the angels help an man who has Alzheimer's to realize the music is not over with legendary musicians Al Jarreau, B.B. King, Dr. John and Al Hirt.  Also there is a myseterious Countess that brings back the old days. The second episode is Then Sings My Soul where the angels help the nephew of the Taffy Town candy factory founder Uncle Dudley to realize that the factory is not just another factory it is a loving, caring and compassionate environment that almost is lost due to unsafe working conditions that could cost everyone not just their jobs but their lives as well.  I really like the ending.",1334534400,,674,4.56198347107438
