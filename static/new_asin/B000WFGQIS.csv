2967727,5,B000WFGQIS,"It's strange that someone would give this film a one star review.  But then again, everyone has their own different views on things, especially movies.  Anyways... I've looked at this film over and over again, and I actually do feel the love connection between Kymani's and Cherine's character. The storyline doesn't only focus on the Romeo and Juliet scenario, but it also touches base on how people see Rasta and Christianity on a whole.  Kymani actually touched based on that during the film when he talks about the Rasta livity. Another thing to note is that there are different sectors of Rastafari.. Whether it is Bobo or 12 Tribes. I wouldn't say it's focusing on those elements of Rasta, but mainly the livity (their way of life including spirituality).  Many of the points that was touched on is so true, and some people can therefore make a connection to it. An example is the way one looks at a Rastaman being with a Christian woman, or vice versa.  You can't escape the feelings of love no matter what religion or belief you may be in.  You will always feel that way, and it's up to you in the end to give in to it.  I can't give this movie a ONE star... This movie is a must see... as it involves love, a little bit of history, beautiful scenery and music, and reality.

FIVE STARS!!!",1218067200,14,1297,4.48936170212766
2967728,1,B000WFGQIS,"For those who like Jamaican reggae-inspired films like ""Rockers"" or ""Dancehall Queen,"" this film will prove somewhat disappointing. The unsuspecting buyer is meant to think that this movie is a positive, romantic courtship story between Kymani Marley and Cherine Anderson. And although Marley and Anderson work hard to breathe life into this movie, the screenplay seems incomplete, and does not inspire feelings of love.
First of all, the plot is too predictable. The film borrows elements from ""Romeo and Juliet,"" but this part of the film is presented in a largely hurried and contrived manner: Kymani's friends disapprove of Cherine, and Cherine's church congregation disapproves of Kymani, as if they're all being cued to do so, but the charatcters are not developed well enough to enable the viewer to empathize with their feelings. They just appear to dislike each other because they're ""supposed to.""
The so-called ""Rasta lifestyle"" depicted in the film isn't very believable, and the music seems mostly incidental. Unlike ""The Harder They Come"" and ""Rockers,"" the reggae songs in this film are very flat and are not particularly cogent, despite the abundance of stereotype ""rastafarian fashions"" worn by Kymani's band members.
On a positive note, the camera shots are very beautiful and full of color. Cherine Anderson is very pretty, and her wardrobe is well crafted. The film presents a lush and positive image of Jamaica that is devoid of the dusty, shantytown ghetto images that plague other Jamaican films, such as ""Third World Cop"" and ""Shottas.""
Overall, this film's image is very positive, but the plot will leave you feeling more cheated than uplifted - it's kind of like the formulaic ""Drumline,"" as compared to the classic ""School Daze."" You never truly feel the love connection between Kymani and Cherine's characters, and throughout the storyline, you never really grow to dislike the so-called ""villains"" of the film -- most notably the church keyboardist (played by Idris Elba) who is within one month of marrying Cherine's character, and struggles to stop Kymani from stealing her and ruining his wedding dreams. You will feel more depressed by the tragic fall of Idris' character than you will feel energized by the eventual romance between Kymani and Cherine.
In a nutshell, this film is another black-entertainment trojan horse. If you can see this film for free, or for a greatly reduced price, then go for it, but don't pay more than $5 for the DVD. You will feel like you've been bamboozled.",1209859200,3,2521,5.121359223300971

2967754,5,B000WFGQIS,"Two weeks ago I was flipping through the menu to find something to watch, face it nothing good comes on television anymore. This movie was scheduled to play at midnight and i decided to but the reminder on so i can watch it at midnight. The reason I decided to watch this was because I didn't know that Bob Marley had children other than Ziggy (I'm not jamaican), so that sparked my interest in staying up to watch this movie.

I am so glad, I watched this movie, it is now one of my new favorite movies. The acting was great and the chemistry between the characters was great. The movie is about a young lady whose heart is divided between two men; the young lady is a christian and a preacher's daughter, she was set to marry a gentleman from church whom her father approved of. One day while working at a shared music studio she caught the attention of a non-christian, a rasta singer played by Ky-Mani Marley, at first she didn't give him the time of day but something about him and his persistance started a spark in her heart, thus causing a dilemma. Should she stay with the christian that she and her father knows (or thinks they know)? or Should she follow her heart, although the one who captured her heart is not a christian?

This movie is excellent, it has romance, conflict and music; I have nothing but love for this movie.",1425600000,2,1338,4.391129032258065

He performance was captivating, real and well perceived as authentic. When I consider all of the classic and iconic movies i.e. Boyz in the Hood, How Stella got her groove back, Ddaddys Little Girl, Love Jones etc...this movie ranks in the same category and in most cases better.

I like the concept of the movie it really would open your mind to learn the real meaning behind certain religions or just people in general. People often judge not only by the color of the skin but how the person might be dressed but if you take the time to really get to know the person you would find out you had more in common than you would ever believe maybe even the same passions.

I think the music was great, the story-line was cool and the cinematography and backdrop of Jamaica itself was breath taking. Being a Jamaican myself, Rastafarians are often the victims of negative stereotype and the movie holds truth to that many family despises them, especially when seeking a Rasta as a ""soul"" mate. ;o) Definitely check it out. Plus it doesn't hurt that Kymani is a cutie pie. The only problem I had with the movie was, I felt the chemistry between Kymani and Cherine Anderson was a bit off. She looked like his little sister more than a love interest. LOL But overall a great Jamaican film. ;o)",1265241600,3,729,4.572519083969466

3202248,5,B000WFGQIS,What a nice story. You cannot judge per your beliefs. I always felt religion destroy people.

3202251,5,B000WFGQIS,"Two weeks ago I was flipping through the menu to find something to watch, face it nothing good comes on television anymore. This movie was scheduled to play at midnight and i decided to but the reminder on so i can watch it at midnight. The reason I decided to watch this was because I didn't know that Bob Marley had children other than Ziggy (I'm not jamaican), so that sparked my interest in staying up to watch this movie.

I am so glad, I watched this movie, it is now one of my new favorite movies. The acting was great and the chemistry between the characters was great. The movie is about a young lady whose heart is divided between two men; the young lady is a christian and a preacher's daughter, she was set to marry a gentleman from church whom her father approved of. One day while working at a shared music studio she caught the attention of a non-christian, a rasta singer played by Ky-Mani Marley, at first she didn't give him the time of day but something about him and his persistance started a spark in her heart, thus causing a dilemma. Should she stay with the christian that she and her father knows (or thinks they know)? or Should she follow her heart, although the one who captured her heart is not a christian?

This movie is excellent, it has romance, conflict and music; I have nothing but love for this movie.",1425600000,2,1338,4.391129032258065

Its a low budget movie that didn't get a lot of press, but still a great movie.  unfortunately, I ordered the movie two months ago and haven't gotten the movie in the mail yet.  :-(  I rented the movie first from Red Box; which made me want to buy the movie.  It would be great if I could get the movie I paid for!!!",1391990400,2,336,3.8823529411764706

3202275,5,B000WFGQIS,"OMG...i rented this movie at Redbox and did not really expect much. I was WRONG. Who is this Ky-Mani guy? he is an awesmoe actor and we need to see more of him. He performance was captivating, real and well perceived as authentic. When I consider all of the classic and iconic movies i.e. Boyz in the Hood, How Stella got her groove back, Ddaddys Little Girl, Love Jones etc...this movie ranks in the same category and in most cases better. I love beach so the scenes of Jamaica were beautiful and a perfect backdrop for this love story. I am definitley buying this movie.",1375142400,,572,4.457142857142857

3202280,5,B000WFGQIS,"This movie was great. I watched it a few times. I still love the music to this day, they chose the best music of the time. I like the concept of the movie it really would open your mind to learn the real meaning behind certain religions or just people in general. People often judge not only by the color of the skin but how the person might be dressed but if you take the time to really get to know the person you would find out you had more in common than you would ever believe maybe even the same passions.

It's a low budget (I think) movie that tells a great story of how two people with different religious beliefs over come those barriers inspite of what the nay sayers thought.  It's a very simple but sweet story.  The location shots are very nice.

Enjoy!",1299024000,9,300,4.60377358490566

3202284,4,B000WFGQIS,"A friend of mine recommended that I see this movie and I""m so happy that she did. I absolutely loved this movie. I think the music was great, the story-line was cool and the cinematography and backdrop of Jamaica itself was breath taking. Being a Jamaican myself, Rastafarians are often the victims of negative stereotype and the movie holds truth to that many family despises them, especially when seeking a Rasta as a ""soul"" mate. ;o) Definitely check it out. Plus it doesn't hurt that Kymani is a cutie pie. The only problem I had with the movie was, I felt the chemistry between Kymani and Cherine Anderson was a bit off. She looked like his little sister more than a love interest. LOL But overall a great Jamaican film. ;o)",1265241600,3,729,4.572519083969466
3202285,5,B000WFGQIS,This is the best movie that I have seen so far out of Jamaica. There are other Jamaican movies that I have watch and would not take a second look. With ths movie I found my self keep watching over and over again. The passion and chemistry between Kymani and Cherine was wonderful. I would love for them to do a part 2 of this movie in the future but not too far in the future.,1251158400,,376,3.960526315789474
