2640107,5,B000HRMAQI,"I bought this after seeing a short clip on a DVD I received as a gift. I did not know much about the Dalai Lama, but obviously knew who he was. The DVD footage is very informative and I really enjoyed watching him speak. There is something very calming about just watching him speak and discuss such a wide range of interesting topics. I highly recommend this DVD.",1191974400,23,364,4.367647058823529
2640108,4,B000HRMAQI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. This DVD is comprised of 3 seperate lectures given by H.H.Dalai Lama on Meditation and Compassion. His talks on compassion are very inspirational. His message is one of tolerance, patience, compassion, forgiveness, as ways to help human kind. Through his lectures we learn about positive vs negative mental states and how our own mental states and attitudes affect not only our immediately environment and ourselves, but also, humanity at large. He has an endearing personality and is fun to listen to. This is someone that despite his position, he remains humble and easy to relate to. The only drawback I found on this DVD was that there are no subtitles. H.H. sometimes has a thick accent. Often I found myself having to rewind a bit and listen again to a particular word or phrase. I think subtitles in English and also in other languages would make his beautiful and powerful messages accessible to more people.",1189468800,37,947,4.925
2640109,5,B000HRMAQI,"I liked this DVD a lot. I am not a Buddhist, but am interested in psychological/philosophical/spiritual questions. I am also interested in learning more about meditation and all the health benefits associated with it. This DVD spans a wide range of topics over 4 hours of talks with the Dalai Lama touching on a number of issues central to finding personal and collective happiness. What I liked most is seeing the personality of one of the greatest thinkers of our time and how gentle and thoughtful he is. Highly recommended.",1177545600,46,527,4.866666666666666

8140804,5,B000HRMAQI,"If I lost everything I have ever read from my mind.  What I have learned from the man would be missed the most.  This is a perfect book to introduce you to the most compassionate person alive today in my humble opinion.  This man is without ego. He was exiled from his country in the late 50's.  Millions of his countrymen and women have been murdered.  There is a systematic destruction of the Tibetan Culture going on right now.  Human rights are being violated unbelievably.  But the economic benefit of being China's friend keep our government from protesting it.  If Tibet had oil there is no way America would allow this to happen,  It's difficult to understand how HH can remain a truly happy person.  But he is.  Another paradox is even though Tibet suffers without him.  The rest of the world has benifited tremendously from the Dalai Lama being forced out in to the rest of the wold.  He is my hero.",1421712000,2,909,4.5030674846625764
8140805,4,B000HRMAQI,Not at all as described.  H.H only appears at the end. Seems to be some information useful for a beginner.,1418428800,,106,4.3
8140806,5,B000HRMAQI,"This is an excellent DVD and it has three different speeches by the Dalai Lama. It might be a little difficult to understand his accent but I was able to understand it very well.
1. Meditating with the Dalai Lama, 2. The Power of Compassion, 3. Compassion: The Basis of Human Happiness.",1414972800,,286,4.519230769230769
8140807,5,B000HRMAQI,I had read that people say H. H. the Dalai Lama has a accent that is too hard to understand and needs sub titles for this video. My opinion is that it was all coherent and I enjoyed it. The material was at a beginner level and was also nice because the principles are all formed at the basic level.,1395360000,,298,3.9833333333333334
8140808,2,B000HRMAQI,"It was a great message, very clear and good audio, but at times very difficult to understand and decipher His Holiness' accent.",1356048000,2,127,4.818181818181818
8140809,4,B000HRMAQI,The lecture and material in the dvd is fantastic.  I did not give it five stars because the Dalai Lama does not have the best english (as he himself admits) and can make it difficult to understand at times.,1229731200,5,206,4.282051282051282
