8457191,5,B005519CPS,"If you are a fan of classic 1970's to early 1990's Pro Wrestling this
Face Off Shoot interview is for you
you have one of the best storytellers in Honky Tonk Man
and one of the greatest minds in all of ECW talking opening and honestly about the pro wrestling business
The only negative is the topics are manic and go from one thing to something completely out of left field

I've watched  6 or so RF Face Off's this is one of the best overall so interesting, and fun to experience  10/10
If you are not a major Honky Tonk Man fan you will be after this Shoot",1451433600,,558,4.10091743119266
