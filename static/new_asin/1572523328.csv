7797468,3,1572523328,"""What Ever Happened to Kerouac?"" is a documentary now available on DVD about sporadic creativity enshrouded in decadence, degeneracy, and decay.  It impressionistically recounts the adult life of Jack Kerouac (1922-1969), the literary beat of the ""beat generation.""

The ""Beats"" (circa 1948-1960?) are sometimes cast as proto-hippies:  Bohemian; anti-establishment; aflame with the exotic and taboo; worshippers at the Dionysian fount of creativity; nonconformists-now nihilist, now visionary; poets of the absurd and the profound; idolizers of Charlie Parker's jazz.  Theirs was gut-existentialism and ""Beat Zen,"" Hindu cosmology and nuclear eschatology.  ""To be Beat,"" wrote Kerouac, ""was to be at the bottom of your personality looking up.""  Beat was birthed by the misfits, the downbeat, the offbeat-not by the poor urchins who could manage no more than sleeping in parks and begging money, but by the artistic urchins who gave a voice to their rebellion and (somehow) got published.

Kerouac was arguably magnificent at times-churning out rambling, but poetic prose-despite the fact that he was dubbed by one of the literati as ""a Neanderthal with a typewriter.""  The film is appropriate punctuated by Kerouac reading chunks of prose on ""The Steve Allen Show.""  Kerouac's work was impassioned and original; he invented a genre of continuous, spontaneous narrative seen in novels such as ""The Dharma Bums"" and ""On the Road"" which was written at high speed on a continuous sheet of paper a hundred feet long.  Beat poet Allen Ginsburg called it ""a magnificent single paragraph several blocks long.""

But Kerouac burned bright but briefly, then burned out rapidly, because being Beat meant being a rogue.  As the interviews with family, friends, and acquaintances make plain, Kerouac was a drunk (who drank himself to death), an adulterer, a drug user, and a buddy of more of the same misfits of the day such as William Burroughs (homosexual and junkie), Allen Ginsberg (homosexual and sometimes psychotic), and other assorted thieves, dopers, and thrill-seekers.

But decadence was heralded as transcendence and orgies as oracular.  Cultural critic Carl Raschke notes that ""Kerouac was self-consciously attempting to depict the whirl of sensation as the key to cosmic understanding, as a vehicle of liberation:  though he left little distinction between the liberation of the mind and libertinism of the youthful rake and rebel.""

Decadence was avant-garde, and was touted as the engine of artistry.  But the gaunt, sour, bitter faces of many of his now aged or recently deceased compatriots reveal that debauchery indeed debauches-even debauches the Beats, and especially Kerouac.  Handsome, lithe, and vigorous as a young man, middle age found him to be bloated and beaten beat.

Particularly pathetic are short clips of William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" in 1969.  Buckley presided over the intellectual debris of a quasi-incoherent Kerouac who was asked to consider the relationship between Beats and Hippies.  An unflappable Buckley gracefully withstood Kerouac's juvenile ramblings, seeking to bring coherence out of chaos.  Buckley smiled knowingly.  Kerouac smirked contemptuously-an appropriate Beat response, perhaps.  A rummied out rebel without a cause met a conservative rebel with a cause.  The juxtaposition was telling, almost painful.

Kerouac at his best may have unmasked some of the pretensions of a complacent, self-righteous, post-war America; he may have celebrated elements of life-such as bebop jazz-that were unjustly ignored by others.  But he exacted too high a price.  By going ""on the road"" he deserted the Protestant work ethic that undergirds a productive and healthy culture, exchanging postponed gratification for immediate gratification (and addiction), exchanging hard work for protracted play-and encouraged others to follow suit.  His promiscuity denied the sanctity of the family.  (We see several clips of his abandoned daughter reflecting on her father's life.)  But Kerouac and friends corrupted more than themselves; they inspired a whole counterculture-as William Burroughs notes in the film-that both amplified and refined the Beat spirit of nonconformity, hedonism, and Eastern religious intrigue.  And don't we even hear something of ""the beat"" in the punks?

The film reports that Kerouac said that because he was a Catholic he couldn't commit suicide, so he decided to drink himself to death (which is really gradual suicide).  Although his prose drew inspiration eclectically from Buddhism, Hinduism, and just about anywhere-Beat was nothing if not unsystematic-several friends and his priest tell us that Kerouac was entranced by the crucifix, and painted pictures of Christ and cardinals toward the end.  Yet no conversion was evident-only an alcoholic's eroded body, mind, and soul.  It seemed he never caught the spirit of the one he could not forget.  Jesus said ""seek and you shall find.""  Jack Kerouac must have been looking in all the wrong places.",1141516800,14,5009,5.490861618798956
7797469,5,1572523328,Ignore all the other negative connotations regarding this dvd release and dig this.... this is the only release you need regarding  Kerouac .. Corso is monumental..

7797470,5,1572523328,"This DVD had an impact on me that was similar to the first time I read ""On the Road.""  The scene where he reads on the Steve Allen show made me cry... his beautiful sadness kept me enraptured.",1109980800,10,192,4.052631578947368
7797471,5,1572523328,"Every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for Jack ""Ti Jean"" Kerouac! To actually see most of Kerouac's fellow writer's and poet's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated ""genius"" that was this brother Lowellian is in itself a magnificent production! I bought this DVD today at a mall in New Hampshire and could have bought it for less on Amazon.com! Just a few minutes ago I did order the DVD ""Jack Kerouac-King of the Beats"" on Amazon.com and can't wait for its arrival! If it's anything like ""What Happened To Kerouac?"" then it will surely be another masterful production! After I write this review I am going to watch this DVD again and experience the same chills as I did when initially watching it for the first time! Anyone that is a true fan of Kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius! To hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of Kerouac himself is truly awe-inspiring! This production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is: Jack Kerouac!",1078617600,15,1191,4.622641509433962

7797474,4,1572523328,"Nothing happened to Jack Kerouac. He died like the rest of us eventually will. Jack Kerouac was a regular human being. Now you're problably saying ""yea I already knew that, so what?"". But what you problably  didn't know is that Jack used literature to show how beautiful and ugly  human beings can be. Kerouac was a man equally feminine as he was masculine  (read Charter's biography about his relationships with Ginzy, N.C., as well  as the women of his life.) All of this is touched on in the video  documentary, which thrives off the somber emotion,and that sort of  ""grey sky comtemplation"" of things, which seems to pervade all of  Jack's work.  The video moves through Jack's life in a fairly  straightforward manner. We see him as a shy french speaking Mass.  adolescent, a cleft chinned Columbia undergraduate, a rucksack wanderer,a  chanting buddhist,an aloof catholic, who loved his mother and drank much  too much Johnnie Walker.  In ""What happnened to Jack?"" we see  Jack as who he really was, a confused, tortured, disenfranchised,happy,  unhappy writer who was very good at putting words together, which gave an  honest glimpse of what was going on in his heart and his mind.  There are  many great moments in the video. Any beat ""junkie"" will love the  footage of Jack and Allen coolin' it near Columbia, smoking cigarettes and  shootin' pool.  There's a clip of Bird and Diz blowing hot jazz, the beats  in S.F. at the debut of Ginzy's ""Howl"", Mike McClure, Jack,  Snyder and Ferlinghetti at Big Sur recitin' and writin' smooth synapses of  the happenings there and around. There are countless anecdotes and picturs  of all your ""beat heroes"", which portray them as strikingly  regular and very un-heroic.  The video as a complete work is very  delicious, but the tastiest bits come when Jack reads ""October in the  Railroad Earth"" to a montage of San Francisco images. When a debonair  Jack reads ""On the Road"" to Steve Allen's bluesy piano in perfect  phrasing and time. And last but not least there is the comical and  strangely serious Greg Corso explaining genious, fame, and why he thinks  the ""Beat Generation"" was a phenomenon. Kerouac would problably  want you to see this video because it shows that he was not a fad, an icon,  nor a saviour for a generation. He was simply a regular man trying to find  answers to very un-regular questions and he used his writing talent to  unravel those mysteries.",963446400,146,2426,4.815085158150851
7797475,5,1572523328,"The other review on this page is great, and I don't have much to add except a second opinion. Gregory Corso is a 'hoot' in this video, grousing that the clip-on mic is messing up his coyote pin. Hee.  A good all-around  documentary, altho it does seem to focus on the chaotic side of the Beats.  For fans of Kerouac and/or the Beats, it's well worth it.  The Buckley  interview is a bit painful to watch, however.  You get a sense of a very  shy man fame didn't treat very well.  You get a great sense of camaraderie  among the people interviewed: these people were friends, who just happened  to be at the focus of a new movement in literature.  And it sure sounds  like they had fun.",948240000,14,685,4.265625
