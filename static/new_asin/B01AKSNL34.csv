8747649,5,B01AKSNL34,"You'll have to provide your own broken seats and sticky floors, but these chop-socky trailers do bring back a big chunk of the grindhouse experience. Found in a UK Chinese restaurant/failing repertory cinema, the 31 trailers are from the golden age of Bruceploitation through the rise of kung fu comedy (1972 - 1983). The prints are crappy but watchable, the badly translated subtitles are often hilarious, and the movies run the gamut from acknowledged classics to such weirder-than-weird obscurities as KUNG FU VS. YOGA. (Gotta love ONE-ARM CHIVALRY FIGHT AGAINST ONE-ARM CHIVALRY for the title alone.)

Ric Meyers and Frank Djeng do an informative tag-team history of kung fu cinema in one of the special features. I'm saving the four-man audio commentary with Meyers and his friends for another day.",1464307200,4,803,5.176923076923077

8747651,4,B01AKSNL34,"I love trailers and kung fu and there were a lot of kung fu trailers I have not seen on the DVD but, the trailers were kind of long and I wish they would have been shorter trailers that way more trailers could have been on the DVD. Also, inside the DVD looked as if there should have been a pamphlet or something inside because, it had the two tabs there to hold something in place and nothing was there. Overall I liked the DVD because I got to see trailers for kung fu movies I never saw before. DVD quality was great, the seller shipped the item promptly and it arrived quickly.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Trailers-Of-Fury/dp/B01AKSNL34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Trailers Of Fury</a>",1458864000,,745,5.216666666666667
8747652,5,B01AKSNL34,"A walk down memory lane. A must for any old school kung fu movie fanatic. Brilliant copy,eventough a few trailers had rope lines,but definitely worth every dollar. Loved the special feature discussion. Fortunately I own all 32 movies that were previewed and most of the original posters which I collected over the years",1458086400,5,319,5.037735849056604
8747653,5,B01AKSNL34,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Some of my fondest memories from childhood involve watching kung fu and ninja movies with my little brother on the weekend.  To me back then, martial arts were just as mysterious as sex; I had heard of them, but knew nothing about them firsthand.  So when the fine folks at Severin and CAV decided to release a compilation of obscure kung fu movie trailers, I almost leapt for joy.  This would be the perfect way to revisit some of those fond memories of yesteryear.

And sure enough, this collection does not disappoint.  Crammed onto this single Blu-ray are two hours of some of the finest (and some of the hokiest) martial arts films known to man.  If you are any kind of of action film fan, this trailer collection will be a must own for sure.

I cannot begin to tell you how nostalgic these trailers made me feel.  Many of the films represented are new to me, but many I had seen, and even more so had I heard about.  I am not sure how many of these films are actually still in print, but Id be very curious to find out.

One detail about the trailers in KUNG FU: TRAILERS OF FURY that stands out to me is the clip lengths.  Some of them are almost five minutes long, an almost unheard of length of time by todays standards.  Several of the trailer clips present huge chunks of the fight choreography, a nice eye-popping treat for viewers interested in the titles.  I don't remember seeing many martial arts movie trailers back in the day, but I don't remember them being this long.  This is not a complaint, eithersimply an observation.

My sole complaint about this collection is one that neither Severin nor CAV can control:  the quality of some of the trailers is poor.  Some have grainy pictures, while some have a skip in the picture here and there.  Obviously, this is not an easy fix, so I begrudge neither company in any way.  Again, this is simply an observation.

But I still love KUNG FU: TRAILERS OF FURY, and I highly recommend it to fans of the genre, particularly those who are looking for rare and obscure titles.  If you're new to these kinds of films, then picking this collection up will be a real treat and a great introduction into films that set the tone for recent classics, such as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.",1457913600,5,2316,4.438388625592417

8747655,5,B01AKSNL34,"You love Kung Fu?  You love trailers?  Then don't hesitate.  Coming from a 30 year Kung Fu fan I can tell you these are no rehashed Kung Fu trailers you have seen before.  These were discovered in a Chinese Restaurant, of all places, and are original 35mm print trailers converted to blu-ray of some great historical (and some not so historical) martial arts films.  In their original language!  An added audio commentary to give some fairly great context to the films (including some interesting info on the sub-genre Bruceploitation from actor and fan, Michael Worth).  For the fan of these films, you won't be disappointed.",1454889600,8,626,4.904761904761905
