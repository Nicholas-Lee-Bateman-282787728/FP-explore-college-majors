8758620,5,B01EGQQNGS,"I want to say right off that I think SORCERER is one of the greatest American films, period. It's also Director William Friedkin's crowning glory, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BRING-ME-THE-HEAD-OF-ALFREDO-GARCIA/dp/B00J7N2VMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA</a>&nbsp;is to Sam Peckinpah, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHITE-DOG/dp/B001GCATWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHITE DOG</a>&nbsp;to Sam Fuller. The film restoration and it's Blu-ray transfer is absolutely stunning. Because most of the film takes place in a poor, backward South American country governed by a corrupt dictator, and the plot deals with still contemporary issues such as upper-level financial fraud, terrorism, revolution, and the exploitation of the poor and the environment by ""Big Oil"" and their own government, it doesn't seem dated one whit. I saw this in the theater when it was first released knowing about the general bad reviews, although there were some good ones as well. Maybe STAR WARS mania overshadowed it at the time, maybe the title did deceive some people who had no idea about the plot in advance, but all I know is when it was over it had instantly become one of my favorite movies. Another complaint was/is that's it's basically a remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WAGES-OF-FEAR/dp/B001PYD0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WAGES OF FEAR</a>...so what? STAR WARS was basically a modern take on the old cliffhanger adventure serials. THE WAGES OF FEAR is a great film in it's own context, but it just can't match the cinematography, pacing and intensity of SORCERER. It still probably wouldn't be a ""blockbuster"" if it was released today, the movie-going public's idea of entertainment these days are either ""event"" extravagances full of computer graphics, or the same old cliches, ""all-star"" celebrity casts, simple plots, the obligatory sex or nudity scene, and lots of explosions...just like STAR WARS (although there is a terrific explosion in SORCERER). STAR WARS is OK, I've seen it twice, the original and the special edition, where I've watched SORCERER every year since I purchased it on LaserDisc.  Everyone that I've shown this movie to ""cold"" couldn't believe it's not well known. It's just like people's experience with gay people, once they actually KNOW a gay person, or if a friend or relative comes out, 99% of the time they change their attitude and find they are not godless degenerates but real people like them.  I think European and foreign audiences are more educated about cinema and attuned to films that make you think, that don't need to have  all-star casts or happy endings. That's why films such a this or say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CROSS-OF-IRON/dp/B00F5WYDUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CROSS OF IRON</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VIOLENT-SATURDAY/dp/B00I5KS770/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VIOLENT SATURDAY</a>&nbsp;are appreciated more over there, with many readily available in restored deluxe editions on DVD and Blu-ray. I implore anyone interested in cinema to invest in a Region-Free Blu-ray player, you'll never regret it. If you've never seen this movie, don't read anything about it before watching. As long as you're not too sensitive to violence (that only occurs to advance the story and not gratuitous) or roller-coaster thrill rides that you'll be thinking about for days, let SORCERER cast it's spell on you......",1464566400,,3644,6.240556660039761
