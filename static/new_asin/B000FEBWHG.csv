2562149,5,B000FEBWHG,I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about but this season was WAAAAAAAAAAAYYY better than Season 1. Season 2 was pure comedy. If you want to laugh get this DVD.,1178496000,,174,4.46875

2562151,2,B000FEBWHG,"I thought the first season of Bridezillas was hilarious so I picked up this one hoping for more of the same.  This time they aren't New York brides, they're from all over the country and the show has a few added elements including ""factzillas""--snippets of information including wedding folklore and superstitions.  The women in this season are just ridiculous and they aren't nearly as likeable as the ones from the first seasons.

Couples to note:

Adrianna and Jason: Adrianna is only 19 years old, still lives with her mother, and works one day a week as a piano teacher.  She met 20-year-old Jason over the phone when he accidentally dialed the wrrong number and four days later he proposed. She has meltdowns over everything from her wedding dress, to her homemade bouquets and even suffers a last minute case of cold feet.  It's evident she's still young when you see her go from yelling at her mother one minute to hysterically crying the next.

Jada and Julius: Jada is a publicist in Chicago and having worked as an event planner she has definite ideas about how she wants her wedding to go. Her fiance Julius just goes along with her and only asks that they incorporate the African tradition of jumping the broom.  Jada is a perfectionist and her bridesmaids have to look EXACTLY down to their french manicures, hair, and makeup. When she calls the decorator she hired to decorate their New Orleans-themed banquet hall, the dressing down she gives him is truly deserving of the title Bridezilla.

This season was okay, but not nearly as good as last season.  Overall, I'd say skip it entirely and just go with Season 1.",1153440000,9,1630,4.72791519434629
2562152,2,B000FEBWHG,"I picked this up because I saw snip bits of it on TV, not to mention I want to know what to stay away from when planning my own wedding. Well this DVD was plan boring and at some points just unbelievable. The husbands just sat there like dummies and the things that were so detrimental weren't even that big of a deal. I was looking to see some serious things to be pissed off about during your wedding.

Glad I rented it won't even think about going back to get Season 1. I will catch Season 3 on WE if they have one.",1153267200,2,518,3.980769230769231
8121468,5,B000FEBWHG,I absolutely love this show. The second season is where the direction of the 10 season series really takes off. If you  like reality TV/ petty drama this is the show for you. 5/5 stars for this one and slowly buying up every season!,1471046400,,232,4.2727272727272725
8121469,1,B000FEBWHG,"I am returning this season in addition to Bridezillas Season 1. These brides are nothing like the later Bridezillas. Again like the first season, there are no tears, screams, or drama. They reuse vendors and the brides are exclusive to the NY and NJ areas. While the price is much better than the first season, you aren't paying for a night of laughs with your friends. One difference between the disks is season two throws in random facts about weddings during commercial pauses. I still would not recommend this purchase. Hopefully they will release the later Seasons on DVD for purchase.",1470528000,,590,4.851485148514851

8121472,3,B000FEBWHG,I was expecting the other tv series Bridezillas on WE which I though was very funny.,1409529600,,84,4.3125
8121473,1,B000FEBWHG,"I can't get over how boring it is, thank God this show changed their way of filming and picking the girls, because season 1 and 2 suck!",1397260800,2,135,4.037037037037037
8121474,3,B000FEBWHG,"The play this show up to really be something it's really not. Although is it somewhat entertaining, they play these girls up to be really awful witches but they are really just a little stressed.

The show has family members trying to convince the viewing audience that these women are really demanding and moody to the point it's overkill, and the actual bride's behavior doesn't live up to the hype. Sure, these brides show some temper, but nothing really out of the ordinary in my opinion.

The best bride is Gretchen, and not because she's a so called bridezilla, but just because she is naturally funny. And she has the most outrageous scene out of them all when she calls the cops on the repair men for her mother's rental car.

The closest to a ""bidezilla"" is Noelle who only really succeeds in proving to herself and her new husband that she is just plain selfish. During and interview segment, he leaves the interview. They film the argument and he tells her just how selfish she is being. Apparently there is a love story that the couple like to tell, but when the Bridezilla cameras rolled it suddenly became a Noelle story and her future husband felt the unbalance. Later, on the day of her wedding, she is over an hour and a half late to her own wedding. The church had booked two wedding that day, which is what churches doi. This is part of a church's income to help with operating costs. But Noelle was upset when her priest had to cut ""important"" things out of her ceremony just so the other wedding could proceed on time and without issue. Noelle seemed to think the whole world should have stopped just for her.  This marriage e won't last.

Overall, I get the feeling some of these people just wanted to be on TV. Why someone would want to be on national TV and act immature is beyond me, but some of these people crave the attention I guess.

I honestly expected more temper tantrums over dumb stuff and more fighting and meanness, but it really isn't present here like they advertise it to be.

It's a good one time watch, but it's not like it's presented. I'd rather see them live up to the name of the show.",1301011200,,2131,4.448717948717949

8121476,5,B000FEBWHG,"I know it's horrible, but I'm addicted to this show!  These girls make even me feel sane!",1227571200,4,89,4.235294117647059
