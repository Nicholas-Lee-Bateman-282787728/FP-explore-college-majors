3544772,5,B001E0KS9I,"When I was a kid, I would look at the black POW*MIA flag and honest-to-God, I would feel a shadow fall across my heart even though I was too young to truly know what the flag meant.

Last Flight Home is a fascinating look at the work of the Bent Prop project. Many parts of Last Flight Home are poignant, not the least of which is the interview with the former Japanese soldier.  It includes the components of a good film - unsolved mysteries, real life drama, forensics, and adventure underwater & in the jungle. But it's not fiction!  The team helps to bring home those listed as MIA - one at a time.

As an aside, if I had a family member who recently served in Iraq or who is currently serving in Afghanistan, I don't know if I would choose to watch this film.  WWII was ~70 years ago, but war still has the same outcome - a life is lost in war or a person is severely damaged by war. And that lost or damaged life has a ripple effect.",1350086400,2,939,4.109289617486339
3544773,5,B001E0KS9I,As I watched this DVD it struck me just how lucky we are as Americans to have had such brave people defend us in the past.  It was wonderful to see a group dedicated to honoring these people by searching and locating their remains.  Thank you !,1278115200,7,244,4.170212765957447

I want to tell you about Last Flight Home and Jimmie Doyle and his son Tommy. Before I do, it's only fair that I declare a personal interest: my father was a naval aviator during WWII and flew many missions against the Japanese during the same period and not far from where this superb film is set. But I get ahead of myself ...

Jimmie Doyle was a crew member of Babes in Arms, an Army Air Corps B-24 Liberator based in New Guinea. Back home in Texas, a son was just learning to walk. On August 29th, 1944, he wrote to his wife Myrle: ""Dear Precious ... maybe it won't be too long until the day when I will be home and we will be together again. With your arms around me I can forget all of this and settle down to spending years with you. ... tomorrow is a busy day, and I have to get up early, so I'll stop for tonight ... with all of my love, Jimmy.""

For reasons unknown today, the next morning he was assigned to another B-24 that took off to bomb Japanese forces in the Palau Islands. Anti-aircraft fire sent the four-engine bomber plunging thousands of feet into the lagoon. Three parachutes were seen. All eleven crewmen were listed as missing in action. None came home.

In 1993, as part of an expedition searching for a Japanese trawler sunk by Ensign George H. W. Bush in July 1944, Dr Pat Scannon saw an aircraft wing near the Palau shoreline. His guide knew nothing of its origin or the fate of the crew. ""You can't have this kind of catastrophic failure without death,"" Scannon said, ""and the scene just overwhelmed me ... I didn't want them to be forgotten."" Six years later, the BentProp Project took form.

More than 200 Marine, Navy, and Army Air Corps planes were lost over the Palau archipelago, where Scannon and his team of volunteers use their vacation time to search for crash sites. Their annual trips have recovered the remains of more than fifteen MIAs, whose surviving family members knew only that a father, brother, or husband died defending his country there.

Jennifer Powers and Dan O'Brien's film is part history lesson, part detective story, and all human interest, segueing effortlessly from jungle and watery searches, to profiles of lost airmen, to interviews with their families. While each of the vignettes is guaranteed to touch your heart, none is more moving than the discovery of a sunken B-24. Matching serial numbers with US Air Force records proved it was the Liberator Jimmie Doyle boarded a few hours after writing to his young wife. Half a world away, his son Tommy received a telephone call from Pat Scannon.

""That was just like a dream come true that wasn't ever going to,"" Tommy remembered. ""Somebody's actually found this thing, sixty years on ...""

Tommy and his wife, schoolteachers in Snyder, Texas, agonized over what to do. ""We finally told ourselves - we can't pass this up,"" Nancy Doyle said. ""We just bit the bullet and pulled out the credit card and went.""

In Palau, wearing scuba gear for only the second time, and with the BentProp Team hovering protectively, Tommy was taken to the bottom of the lagoon.

""[My father] was the tail gunner,"" Tommy says. ""There was a hole sorta under the bottom, and I tried to get in as far as I could. . . And to think that ... I may be within ten or fifteen feet of where he died. And to touch the plane that he died in and to think that probably about over there somewhere were his remains - that's pretty, I don't know what the word is. But it grabs your whole heart and twists it in knots, I'll tell you that.

""And we had a little conversation. Nobody else's business, but we had a little conversation in there. And I don't know how to describe it, except that it was just - it was like we made contact. It was like I got to say some things to my dad that I'd never said before.""

Last Flight Home is a testament to fallen warriors, the families
who remember them, and a small group of men and women dedicated
to finding and honoring them.

As I said at the beginning, my father flew in that war. He came
home. Jimmie Doyle and thousands of others did not.",1232150400,41,4220,4.582228116710875
3544776,5,B001E0KS9I,"I saw this film advertised on the history channel during Military week and knew I had to add this to my Library.  This DVD traces the lives of lost soldiers (Typically airmen) from their entrance into the service, to their disappearance.  It lets you learn who these men were, and see the impact their loss and ultimate recovery has/had on their family.  It is a heartwarming display of patriotism and shows closure while remaining constantly reverent to the deceased and their family. This is a truly inspiration and educational film.",1230422400,13,535,4.9222222222222225

3544786,5,B001E0KS9I,I have to say that this was one of the best documentaries that I have watched. This pulled at my heart and I shed tears at the family members that contributed to this show especially the adult children of the lost loved ones that never had the opportunity to get to know there father. The Bent Prop group deserves to be commended on the tireless effort that they give to help family members with closure of there once lost loved ones.,1422316800,,434,4.37037037037037
3544787,4,B001E0KS9I,"Nothing exciting happens in this film. Much of it shows dedicated people walking through jungle undergrowth. Interviews of children, or a sibling, or a niece and nephew bring out a human interest perspective. Of the dedicated people who very much are present in the film it might be said theirs seems to be a mission commissioned from above. Not only do they pay their own way while involved in a particular search but someone had to acquire money to fund this documentary, which most likely has yet to earn back the funds of the initial investment. Their dedication is as much a subject of the film as the men who lost their lives in WWII are subjects. To recover something tangible linked to any one airman or to any airmen compels the searchers to continue exhaustively. As the film shows uncovered remains of fallen WWII servicemen still garner reverent, honorable respect from today's military, a very touching scene indeed.",1421193600,,929,4.849056603773585

3544801,4,B001E0KS9I,"This is a documentary about Dr. Patrick Scannon and his team who travel to the Western Pacific (mostly Palau) to search for the planes, especially of those which held servicemen who are MIA.  Once found, he then contacts JPAC (the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command) which is the department of the military tasked with finding / recovering the remains of those MIA and returning them home to the U.S.  Unfortunately, there are 80,000+ military personnel who are MIA so its not as if they can just drop what they are doing when Dr. Scannon calls. . . but. . . you do see one instance of where they search for remains in the film.  Due to the number of MIA in Palau, and the surrounding area, I really wish there could be a JPAC team devoted to the area.

The film brings to light the plight of the family of the MIA.  Some are able to find at least a bit of closure after Dr. Scannon and his team find the plane of their relative.

Dr. Scannon, and his team, does this as a labor of love. You can find out a lot more at their website, bentprop.org.",1390608000,,1045,4.279187817258883

3544803,4,B001E0KS9I,"I read the book about this team of people and really enjoyed it.  The video is also very good.  As a military retiree I think it is very important that the search of our missing veterans go on on a continuous basis.  I didn't realize how expensive finding out dead actually is, so congratulations and thanks to the people who make it happen.",1390003200,2,341,4.380952380952381
3544804,5,B001E0KS9I,"One of the best documentaries I have seen on WWII or any war. Even though it was not a high end budget film, it was just outstanding. The story line was extremely interesting, especially interesting was the interview with a Japanese solider who beheaded a shot down American crew member and talked about it with very little emotion. There were 70,000 MIAs in WWII. I thank Dr. Patrick Scannon for his commitment to finding and identifying the MIAs in the pacific. He is doing all of this with private funds. God Bless him and God Bless America!",1384387200,5,544,4.618556701030927
3544805,5,B001E0KS9I,"Regarding all the battle sites and killing fields of World War II, this documentary is an eye-opener for those, like me, who thought that the ""past-is-the-past, the-dead-are-gone, we've moved-on"". Just like the on-going search for Amelia Earhart, there is an present-day, under-the-radar search in the Pacific and it's 1000's of islands to bring our heroes home.

WWII's Pacific Theater was massive in size, and an unbelievable undertaking for Americans, given the relatively low-tech aspect of warfare in 1944. That so many of our boys gave the ultimate sacrifice so far from home is staggering enough, but to realize that so many of them are yet to come ""home"", is sobering to say the least.

Many of the islands of the Pacific, on which and over which much of the fighting took place, are so dense with jungles that it takes researchers eight hours to advance just a quarter of a mile.  And then there is the debate - are the ""finds"" of crashed aircraft archeological sites or graveyards to be honored and left alone?

What an enriching hour this documentary provided. I can't think of any American demographic, accept the very, very young, who wouldn't find this film spellbinding.",1382054400,8,1185,4.939698492462312
