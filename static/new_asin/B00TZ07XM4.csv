7026163,5,B00TZ07XM4,"I wish Styx and Amazon will get their act together and decide on a release date and stick with it. Its already been changed 3 times already, May 26th, June 29th and now July 24th. Give a date!!",1433116800,6,193,4.105263157894737
7026164,5,B00TZ07XM4,"I was at this concert sitting in row 5! It was an awesome concert! I watched the shortened one on AXS-TV and it was great! I can't wait for this DVD. I guarantee it'll be a 5 star DVD. If it for some strange reason ends up completely different than the concert that I was actually at in The Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'll change my review accordingly. However, that won't happen. Awesome concert/DVD!

UPDATE: I received and watched the DVD and did infact love it! I also loved the interviews/road documentary they added to it! Very impressed.",1430092800,8,553,4.53
7026165,5,B00TZ07XM4,"What a great concert, they play all the favorites that I like!  Love it!",1496966400,,72,4.142857142857143
7026166,4,B00TZ07XM4,"The songs sound great, the filming was good, the concert experience was good, so why four stars? The blu-ray could have used more songs and shorter or fewer interviews. Let's face it, you can listen to songs over and over again, but who wants to listen to the interviews over and over?  But the music it does have is great ... loved Crystal Ball. But I have and prefer The Grand Illusion/Pieces of Eight because obviously it contains most of their best songs and is all music, and contains my favorite Styx song, Man in the Wilderness.",1496102400,2,535,4.515463917525773

7026173,5,B00TZ07XM4,Love Styx. Love this concert but man I would like to hear other songs from their vast catalog.  Seems every DVD/BD has the exact same songs.,1481673600,,140,4.384615384615385
7026174,1,B00TZ07XM4,"Styx always put on a good show, but here they have sacrificed at least half the songs from this performance for a series of the most trivial interviews I have ever seen. This was a missed opportunity for the band members to give some insight in to their work and answer those difficult questions that would have made it worthwhile, such as life post-Dennis and why they have not recorded a new album for many years. Instead we get banal spin and Tommy Shaw saying that he's good at getting rid of cardboard. Rock 'n' roll!",1481673600,,522,4.447916666666667

7026191,3,B00TZ07XM4,"I am a big fan of Styx since I was young. I loved the pieces of 8-grand illusion in Tennessee. This seemed alittle documentary and less playing music, interesting but not as entertaining for my man cave.",1478563200,,203,4.513513513513513
7026192,4,B00TZ07XM4,Only disappointment I had in this was that they left out some of the songs that are on the CD. Other than that was very good. Wish that they would do one more album of new material.,1478044800,,181,3.918918918918919

7026194,5,B00TZ07XM4,At long last.what a very good dvd from the masters of rock.let me tell styx fans of the delay of this wonderfull concert.i have had the pleasure of meeting with all the band on several occasions over the years also the road crew.it was when garry lozzio the sound engineer was taken ill that put recordind behind schedule. Since then garry has passed away after 40 years with styx. R I P long live styx from your most faithfull fan. D Swain Sutton on Sea.,1476748800,2,455,4.364705882352941

Like the interview!",1476057600,2,35,5.0
7026216,3,B00TZ07XM4,"OK, first the good news: The live material that is on here is very good. The band is tight. The rhythm section is thunderous. The guitar playing is very good (maybe it's just me, but J.Y.'s playing seems better than ever!). The video is crisp and well shot. So what is the bad news? Well, for one, a concert video should be more than 50 minutes long! As it turns out, there are 4 songs that are included on the CD that are not on the Blu-ray/DVD (The Grand Illusion, Lady, Suite Madame Blue, Come Sail Away). Not sure why, but it's a shame because those 4 songs are really good!  3/5 for the length and shorting us 4 songs!",1475884800,5,623,4.191666666666666

7026220,1,B00TZ07XM4,"Im sorry but this has got to be one the most overwrought, stagnant bands around. If you like silly songs that don't challenge any thought, sailing away with Aliens, and other dribble, this is one for you.
One of the most boring bands and shows around.",1470096000,3,251,4.478260869565218
7026221,5,B00TZ07XM4,"Styx is just a class act.  They always give a high-energy, positive show with amazing musicianship.  The songs are all great, and these guys haven't lost any of their playing skills.  Tommy Shaw just defies age.  What a singer, guitar player, and showman he is!  James Young remains in top form, too.  And Todd Sucherman is one of the best drummers alive.

The elephant in the room, of course, is the absence of Dennis DeYoung.  I know many Styx fans are emotional about this issue.  But the way I see it, we could either have this music today, or not.  I am glad we have it.",1435708800,14,575,4.339622641509434

8703413,2,B00TZ07XM4,Not as advertised. Shows it in a boy ray box and shows up in a sh***y cardboard sleeve. If you're going to sell it that way then display it that way.,1522540800,,149,3.838709677419355
