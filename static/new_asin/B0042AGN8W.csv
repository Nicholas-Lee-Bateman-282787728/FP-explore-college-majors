8413348,5,B0042AGN8W,"This was the first motivational or "" self help"" DVD I have ever purchased. At a time when I was having some serious personal problems in my life, Coach Bowden really helped me.
This DVD is not like the others in the series.  Bobby Bowden talks about God, religion, and family in this presentation so if you can't watch it with an open mind, you won't get anything out of it.
One doesn't have to be a Bobby Bowden or Florida State fan to enjoy this DVD.  Just understand that this man coached for 57 years and understands a great deal about human nature.",1369353600,,553,4.3076923076923075
