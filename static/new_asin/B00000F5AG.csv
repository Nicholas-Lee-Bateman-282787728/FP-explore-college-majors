Laszlo plays a shrewd operator who parades behind the facade of a nice guy, and who exploits the people of a Budapest rooming house. The complicated plot revolves around Laszlo's attempts to enlarge his one-room cubbyhole into a bigger apartment when the house it torn down and the tenants are allotted new space. He skilfully manipulates everyone for his own ends, always in the role of 'protector' of his fellow tenants...""

That pretty well sums up this film. I think I may have missed out on some of the subtler socio-political humor, not being fully versed in the history of the country, but I think I got the basic gist of the jokes, and if my appreciation of the film was diminished in any way, I didn't really notice. It's maybe the difference between an out-loud guffaw and regular ""ha ha!""

One thing to be aware of though is that the subtitles on this video are sometimes cropped off the bottom of the frame (a defect of the transfer, I assume - Facets' videos are a mixed bag at times), so unless you're a fluent speaker of Magyar (I am not), you're going to miss some of the dialogue. Still, the story's pretty straightforward, so it's not a huge loss, I don't think. Someone else may have a different opinion, though.",1449964800,,1348,4.589211618257261
