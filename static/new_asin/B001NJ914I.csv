3719255,5,B001NJ914I,"Through Lior's own joyful spirit and his story told on film by his parents from early childood we witness the wisdom and grace of a young man with Downes Syndrome who walks with God and speaks to God in a very intimate way.  Some of what Lior says is so wise and so resonantly True ( with a captial T) it just brings you to a hault ..makes you visit it, hold it, honor it in the ground of your being. Lior chants and drums and prays ceaselessly, often from a platform at the top of his swing set wearing his yamulkah and prayer shawl.  Those of us who are contemplatives and use drums and chants as part of our daily meditation  practice know that this does indeed open up chanels to which we normally have no access.  I think it is so with Lior. My own sense, my own experience is that I am closer to God when I listen to folk with Downe's Syndrome and see their art work and other expressions of themselves and their inner life. Much of the film is footage about his preparation for his Bar Mitzphah, in particular writing his speech.  The speaking Lior does at his Bar Mitzphah is authentically his, from his heart, from his constant intimacy with God and he is telling us something importnat about humanity and community. Definitely a film to have in your family library to share and to watch many times together.  Also available as an instant play on Netflix.

3719256,5,B001NJ914I,"Absolutely outstanding.  The journey of faith for all of us and presented through the life of Lior.  I will admit that I have viewed the movie 6 times and each time I am moved by the Faith that Lior lives each day of his life.  I also have had the wonderful blessing of meeting Lior, spending time with Lior and witnessing his faith in all his daily activity.  Lior has truly beeb blessed by God and sent to minister to all of us.  His story is compelling and so richly rewarding.  The movie was well done, expertly produced and a must see for the Judeo-Christian Communities.",1275264000,,576,4.386792452830188
3719257,5,B001NJ914I,"What a wonderful opportunity to take a peak into the life of a special boy with a big heart. I found this documentary to be educational, enlightening and inspiring. I highly recommend it and think it has something to offer everyone.",1273536000,6,232,4.682926829268292
3719258,5,B001NJ914I,"As the mother of a young son with Down syndrome, I was excited to watch this documentary.  Lior is such an amazing young man...so devout in his religion and such an inspiration to the people around him.  Lior shows beautifully the depth of his understanding of God and people.  He is a typical boy in so many ways...with a bit of a stubborn streak just like my son...yet he is also extraordinary in his religious fervor.  It was great to see how the people around him were affected and how some of their fears and preconceptions were changed.  You don't have to be Jewish (I, myself, am Christian) or have a child with Down syndrome to appreciate this movie.  I highly recommend it.",1273536000,3,682,4.504065040650406
3719259,5,B001NJ914I,"I viewed ""Praying with Lior"" recently and found it to be very uplifting. The title character, his family, and the community all show how a young man with Down's Syndrome can be a spiritual leader to those who know him. The film is now funny, now touching, now powerful. I recommend it highly.",1258070400,2,292,4.528301886792453
3719260,5,B001NJ914I,"I purchased this video as a gift for a friend who is a Special Education teacher and is Jewish. She said it was ""inspiring."" I did not view the video, myself.",1257984000,,158,4.129032258064516
3719261,3,B001NJ914I,"Lior's mother, a rabbi, had everything to do with his success, even though the film doesn't touch much on this.  She apparently spent much time with him in early childhood and gave him praise, feedback, inspiration, encouragement, love, understanding, and even wisdom.  After her death, Lior continued to gain approval and inner rewards by 'davening' and becoming the ""Little Rebbe""..a true son of his mother.  This is not to say that Lior doesn't have a true spirituality, which is shown in his optimistic and loving nature.
I learned a lot about Down Syndrome from this film in addition to becoming, very briefly, a (viewing) member of a strong, close-knit family, both normal and abnormal at the same time.  Very interesting and nicely done by the documentarian.",1244764800,9,765,5.0476190476190474

3719335,3,B001NJ914I,At first I thought and was happy to watch an inspiring story about a handicapped boy growing up in a loving and supportive family.  I first got the hint that all was not well when they picked up the big sister.  Little sister was sitting in the back while everyone was making a fuss over Lior. She is being neglected.  He's spoiled and has no boundaries.  When the father and Lior and the step mother were joking about the mother's death at the dinner table I thought it was rather strange.,1449446400,,490,4.351648351648351

3719349,2,B001NJ914I,"'Monkey see, monkey do' sums up the spirituality of nearly all people in this world no less a Jewish Down Syndrome child.  Jewish spirituality is just that, Jewish.  Lior simply repeated prayers, songs and teachings his book, rabbis and parents taught him.  He enjoyed reciting or singing them but what religious person doesn't?  If he were born to a Christian or Muslim family he would be no more spiritual than he is as a Jew.

I couldn't finish this documentary because it misleads its viewers.  The film (according to the description) asks 'whether someone with Down syndrome can be a ""spiritual genius.""'  What is a 'spiritual genius'?  Such a term should be defined.  If there was a possibility that a Down Syndrome child could be a 'spiritual genius' why are there none listed in the Jewish holy book, the Hebrew Bible?  Such children weren't allowed to participate in normal Israelite rituals therefore does the question have any real meaning, especially to a Jew?

Lior should not have been placed in a normal school, a normal class with normal children or on a baseball team.  This unfairly burdens the other children and parents.  If you have a child with 'special needs' then see to it he/she is treated that way and place him/her in special care.  Don't burden other children and parents just so you can make yourself or your child feel better about your situation.",1433548800,,1378,4.808510638297872

3719351,5,B001NJ914I,I personally enjoyed this documentary from start to finish. It is an honest glimpse at a Jewish family's love for one of their children whom has special needs.

3719353,5,B001NJ914I,"This is a priceless gem of a movie. Lior is someone we should all be blessed to know. He is an inspiration and a leader despite (or perhaps because of) having Downs syndrome. This is a documentary of his life. He is Jewish and is completely absorbed in his relationship with God. I am a Christian and I am recommending this to all my Christian friends because if you love God, this is the movie for you. Prepare to be moved by this deeply touching story of a boy who honors his mother's legacy by honoring God. One of the best I've seen in years!!!",1431043200,,548,4.228571428571429

3719355,5,B001NJ914I,A very interesting look at a young man with Down Syndrome and his faith community.  Much of the focus was on ways that different family members and friends valued Lior.  I read other reviews that criticized the film for giving little attention to his day-to-day activities.  This wasn't an expose about Down Syndrome or disability rights.  It was a very nice movie about valuing a fellow human being.,1429574400,,400,4.838235294117647
