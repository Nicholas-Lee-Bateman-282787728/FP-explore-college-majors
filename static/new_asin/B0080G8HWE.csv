5115737,5,B0080G8HWE,"What a gem!  Gripping from the opening shot - a close in shot of a test tube containing wriggling meal worms and EGAD!  Frances Grey (Margaret Lockwood) scared the daylights out of me...I know there must be a woman beneath all of that makeup somewhere.  Guilted into accepting a secret assignment to smuggle some insects of vital importance out of a highly dangerous, Communist-Russianesque country.  Face lacquered, eye brows painted, false black eyelashes glued in place, Frances Grey aka Frances Conway, Entomologist, boards a train to her destination.  Unfortunately, she's not only untrained to act as a secret agent, but her compartment mate is the Chef of Police in Grenze Granitsa - Anton Rasinsky (resembling the offspring of an evil Captain Kangaroo and Samuel Clemens).  He's onto her from the get-go.  Fortunately for her, Bill Casey (a terrific Dane Clark) hones in on her at her rendezvous point, the Caf Mimosa.  Casey takes Conway for a little drive, apparently too much of a gentleman to be embarrassed by her completely ghastly pair of cat's eye sunglasses.  Her contact has been murdered, she's arrested by Rasinsky, yet somehow the Klieg lights don't melt her makeup.  She's injected with the ubiquitous ""truth serum"", spouts nonsense, and is thrown into a filthy cell.  Wilfred Hyde White plays the British Charge d'Affaires.  Then, the real fun begins. There's tension, chemistry, romance, some humor and a twist.  The story is well-paced, well-written, alternating between darkness and light.  The scene near the end of the rousting of train passengers in Grenze Granitsa shows a cast of extras straight out of a Fellini movie - great faces!",1410912000,5,1664,5.114814814814815
5115738,5,B0080G8HWE,This was a good movie.  There was not a dull moment in the move and it had it's comedy side.  I would let my children watch it.,1409702400,,127,3.6666666666666665
5115739,4,B0080G8HWE,"Despite  some  of  the negative  reviews,  I  enjoyed  the  film  very  much,  but  then  I`m  partial  to  Margaret  Lockwood  in  anything
she  does.",1407542400,,151,4.739130434782608
5115740,4,B0080G8HWE,Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it has a few suprises. It's a little quirky. Print quality from VCI is good but like a lot of VCI's product the sound is slightly distorted. Still worth buying.,1371686400,4,216,4.2926829268292686

8523599,4,B0080G8HWE,"interestingly made old thriller with good acting, fairly good ""stuff""as to the writing
and a good beginning and middle. Ending was perhaps a little too pat but still,
a fine work in most ways. Excellent Lockwood; lots of unexpected turns along the way.",1470700800,,252,4.883720930232558

8523603,2,B0080G8HWE,"This is B/w film from the 60's. Appreciated it for 2 reasons: very strong female role, ad for effective object lesson in living under communism. On the other hand, my husband didn't like it because it was a cold war propaganda film with unrealistic assumptions about escaping in a closed country with no prior knowledge of secret instillations, etc.",1469923200,,349,4.932203389830509
8523604,5,B0080G8HWE,"Margaret Lockwood's confidence, looks and overall attitude make this a very enjoyable film, one that should have led to sequels of the character she portrayed- a scientist-turned-espionage operative.",1469664000,,199,6.142857142857143
8523605,3,B0080G8HWE,"Highly Dangerous (1950) is fun, though mild, entertainment for fans of B movies of the 30s through the 50s. Despite the improbable--well, the improbable everything, the actors are suited to the film because they're more down-to-earth than, as just one example, the glamorous Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious. Not that Margaret Lockwood wasn't a beauty, but she's somehow believable as an entomologist. And Dane Clark (in an infrequent lead-male role) is very good as a journalist who, for a reason never explained, has been banished by his editor to cover a small Eastern Block country. A lot of good ideas and plot motivators are never really explained. But the characters, and the caricatures, are enjoyable. Wilfrid Hyde-White adds class, as usual, and his interaction in the last scenes with the main bad guy (Marius Goring in lots of make-up) practically makes the film.",1469318400,,885,5.110344827586207
8523606,4,B0080G8HWE,pretty ok. never seen it before and was  taken aback by a plot twist. sort of a fun little movie adventure.,1468540800,,107,4.095238095238095
