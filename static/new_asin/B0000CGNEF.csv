1919724,1,B0000CGNEF,"I can not believe that CBS is still trying to make money off this crap. If the show was so terrible that it couldn't finish one season on basic cable, what makes you think it is good enough to own. This is a watered-down pathetic version of the movie. If you can't get all the original charecters, then you shouldn't even try. The Sex and the City guy is not the husband in this show. BOO! Don't pay for something that you didn't watch when it was free on TV. Very Bad.",1066608000,23,469,4.108695652173913
1919755,4,B0000CGNEF,So this isn't Toula and Ian from the movies but rather Nia and Thomas. The show was rushed into production and only 7 of the cast are back-we never see Tio Taki-it is sort of a running joke that he is always sick. Still the pros are all here and they are as polished as ever. It is fun to watch this between movie 1 & 2 and the guest stars are a lot of fun to watch.,1493510400,4,366,3.7051282051282053

1919787,3,B0000CGNEF,The series is funny but definitely PG13 for content. All the characters are the same as the movie version except for the husband (groom). The movie version and this TV series guy have completely different personalities.,1484611200,,219,5.111111111111111
1919788,1,B0000CGNEF,Sadly this t.v. show doesn't follow the movie well at all..in the movie we leave off with the couple and a six year old daughter living next door to her parents in the house gifted at the wedding however at the beginning of the sitcom we are in an airport just after the honeymoon with the husband's name now being Thomas instead of Ian like in the movie. Different actor and different mindset towards her family. And apparently the house wasn't given at the wedding.,1483833600,3,467,4.5058823529411764
1919789,3,B0000CGNEF,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the movies! They were all about the MANY ways our parents have of embarrassing us throughout our teen/early adult years. She described the ways for her. We can all relate. It was all done with humor and with more warm family love than I think I could have mustered up at that age. These, however, are from the TV series. Too much CAMP and a total divergence from the subtleties of real life. I was not surprised that it only lasted for a few shows. ave it three stars because I am still glad to have these because theiry are delightfully Nia.",1482105600,,570,4.287037037037037

I don't look for much in a comedy but this was a sequel to a really great movie so I was expecting it to be similar to the first.

1919882,3,B0000CGNEF,Short lived series just does not capture the charm of the movie. The Windex cure is never used or referenced. The laugh track is too heavy handed and overpowers the comedic dialog. Only 7 episodes. Subtle changes like character names and a replacement actor for the husband worked without distraction.,1433376000,,301,5.04

Ok, it's not as good as the movie and it's a little stiff in some places and the acting is a bit over the top in some parts and the stories are not perfect, but it IS funny!

1919945,5,B0000CGNEF,"It's amazing to see the negative revues of this show from people who seem negative.  If you watch the show to be entertained, which was the purpose of this show, you will not be disappointed!  It is funny, light-hearted, and is not meant to be a competition to the movie, but rather a chance for us to continue with the characters we loved from the film.  My only disappointment was having only 7 episodes.  For those who criticize the show for being cancelled so quickly, this is not the only good show to meet an untimely demise.  (look at Firefly, another excellent entertaining show which was cancelled after 11 or 12 episodes).

The first episode, ""The House Gift"" is a great reintroduction to the characters.  Yes, Toula is now Nia, and Ian is now Thomas.  I was able to get over that fact with little pain, so I don't see the big deal for some who cannot seem to live with the new names, or the fact that Thomas is played by a different actor.  It's a TV show, not real life, and these are actors.  Things change. Get over it and enjoy the show.

#2 - The Empire Strikes Back - Nick is hilarious in this episode, and Voula is great.  (In fact, she is the best and most funny character in this series.) Gus and Maria are preparing a will to see who will inherit the ""empire"" (restaurant and house).  Nia inherits the restaurant, and she is none to happy about the aspect of being just like her father.  Watch this one just to see the scene with Voula, Nia and Nick as the women try to approach the subject of who will get the restaurant to Nick.

#3 - The Free Lunch - man does this one seem to get the criticism!  This one is funny too, not a classic, but it is funny, which is what this show is about.  Nia messes up an ""arrangement"" the parents have with the police, and it is up to her, Voula (again the best character, she is hilarious!) and Nicky to save the day.

#4 - Arianna - this one seems liked by most who have watched this series and it is funny, but the funniest part is Voula giving Arianna a mock interview!

#5 - Big Night - Seeing the three woman scream ""Yanni!!!!"" and run toward him like mad school girls is reason enough to watch this episode again and again! Hilarious!

#6 - Nick Moves Out - Maria and Nick are the main reasons to watch this episode.  Even at only 6 episodes so far, character development is great for these two.  Too bad the show couldn't continue as I'm sure we would have seen character development of the others.

#7 - Greek Easter - ""Best Easter ever!""  Funny episode, sad to know it was the last.

So ends the show, which was such a shame.  No sex scenes, no murders, no missing children, no medical emergencies, no infidelity, no profanity.  What a shame. With those it might have lasted longer.  But for those of us who don't need all of that crap in our shows, My Big Fat Greek Life is a reminder that you don't have to be crude to be funny, you don't have to be obscene to be entertaining.",1208217600,38,2946,4.240574506283663

The movie was great, but the sit-com sucks. The movie was full of funny characters, and the humor was very spontaneous. The characters didn't have to try to be funny, because they were just funny anyway. They seemed very genuine in the film, but in the pilot episode of the series, everything seemed so forced. The jokes and one-liners were poorly written and poorly delivered.

Furthermore, the chemistry between Ian and Toula in the film was very convincing; Ian was very charming and Toula was very loving. I thought that both Nia Vardalos and John Corbett did a great job. In the show, however, the replacement Ian (called ""Thomas"" in the show) was a total putz, I didn't like him at all, and he had almost no chemistry with Toula (or ""Nia"", rather). In the film, Ian was very accepting and even enthusiastic to espouse the Portokalos family traditions. But in the show, he bitches to Nia about ""boundaries"" and bickers with Gus about who built Stonehenge.

The only character that was almost tolerable on the show was Gus, the dad. They overdid his dialogue a bit, but he's still funny to watch.

""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was a great movie, it was relatively inexpensive to produce and made lots of money, and people loved it. ""My Big Fat Greek Life"", on the other hand, is just a bad idea; the movie was a great movie and let's just leave it at that, don't corrupt its legacy with a cornball sit-com.",1154217600,3,1516,4.538461538461538
1919949,3,B0000CGNEF,"Lets start with I LOVED MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING!  The movie transended the idea of Greekness and was so common to everyone. I thought the family looked so familier, than I realized it was MINE!

When CBS said they were going to do a weekly TV series based on WEDDING, I was thrilled and delighted!

That was the GOOD news, now the BAD news..This short lived seven episode series died a quick network death (THANK GOD). The series had so much potenial as a series. It could have been another M*A*S*H (A TV show that also started as a film) if the writing was good and kept slightly to the movie story line...IT DIDN'T and the show failed quickly!

I would have liked Nia to talk less and use more facial expressions as she did in the film. She kept running her mouth, a motor mouth..as she was very shy in the film.

This sitcom could have had more bite as a family comedy, it copied everyone else's sitcom styles and not its uniqueness which it had. Most of the supporting characters were very under used, acting as if they were part of the furniture.

On DVD, they could have given the DVD patrons a treat such as an audio commentary, promos, features, etc..alas no extras on can be found on this dvd disk..at least they couldn't give us something.

Ah, if wishes for a good show was something that could happen

1919950,1,B0000CGNEF,"Well this was one of the worst ideas possible.  TV networks have tried to cash in on a lot of great (or even just ok) movies in the past by turning them into TV shows, and after retiring from that idea they suddenly decided to try it again after a 10+ year absence.  The entire cast signed on to do this save for Chris the DJ from Northern Exposure and wow did this fail.  You con only tell the same story or the same joke so many times before it gets old (I'm Greek my husband's not, my family is crazy my husband's isn't, etc.).  It lacked the easy story flow that the movie had and was just another lame sitcom with canned laughter.  This was a real shot in the foot for them, none were able to emerge unscathed except for Chris the DJ, who went onto another cable show because he was a little more savvy than everyone else.",1131667200,3,827,4.111801242236025

Some shows get off to great starts, while others take a little while to catch on. If the network would have let the first season finish who knows what might have become of it?

1919954,5,B0000CGNEF,"Nia Vardalos delighted audiences with her personally scripted blockbuster MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. The movie inspired this short-lived sitcom. This sitcom starring the Canadian-Greek comedienne premiered on CBS on February 24,2003. She is Nia Portakolos married to Ian,an all-American man(Steven Eckholdt). John Corbett,who played Ian in the film already had a show of his own,HBO's recently cancelled ""Sex In The City"",so he contractually could not do MBFGL. Also part of the TV cast who also appeared in the film are Gia Carides as Nia's sister,Michael Constantine as the father and Lainie Kazan as the mother. In every episode there are several flashbacks to Nia's childhood with her much younger mom and dad. Rita Wilson served as executive producer as she did for the movie. In addition to Wilson,other memorable guest appearances were made by Joey Fatone of the singing group NSync,who also appeared in the film as Angelo,and Frank Stallone,who's Sylvester's brother. After 6 or 7 episodes,CBS pulled the plug on this sitcom. See tvtome.com for details. Hopefully Vardalos' next movie,""Connie and Carla"" will be a hit like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.",1081900800,6,1155,5.282608695652174
1919955,3,B0000CGNEF,"Following the enormous success of the 2002 film ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", Brad Grey, Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos (who wrote and starred in the film), along with 8 other people, produced a TV series sitcom with a similar cast and plot entitled ""My Big Fat Greek Life"".  The series aired on CBS in the spring of 2003, but poor viewer ratings brought about its quick demise after only 7 episodes.  Characters that appeared in the TV series that had also appeared in the original film and remained unchanged were Maria Portokalos (Lainie Kazan), Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine), Nick Portokalos (Louis Mandylor), cousin Nikki (Gia Carides) and Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin).  Nia Vardalos, who played Fortula 'Tula' Portokalos in the film, changed her character's name to Nia Portokalos Miller for the TV series.  John Corbett, who played Tula's husband Ian Miller in the original film, was unable to appear in the TV series due to a previous commitment to another TV series.  (That TV series, ""Lucky"", was cancelled by Fox after 13 episodes.)  So, in place of John Corbett, Nia's husband in the TV series was Thomas Miller as played by Steven Eckholdt.
Whereas the 2002 film had been expertly written and successfully drew the audience into its tale of self-discovery and love for its main character, 'Tula' Portokalos, the TV series instead focused primarily on jokes and less engaging, often predictable plot lines.  My rating for each of the seven episodes, as well as each episode's air date, are as follows:
1. ""The House Gift"" (3, 2/24/2003).  After returning from their honeymoon, Nia and Thomas are surprised to learn that Gus and Maria have purchased them a new house.
2. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (3.5, 3/3/2003).  Following the hospitalization of a close friend, Maria and Gus decide to write wills that give the restaurant to Nia instead of Nick.
3. ""Ariana"" (4, 3/9/2003).  Cousin Ariana (guest appearance by Rita Wilson) visits from Greece following her divorce from her cheating ex-husband.  Nia wants to help Ariana build an independent life, but Gus and Maria have other plans for her.
4. ""The Free Lunch"" (1.5, 3/16/2003).  The worst written and edited episode of the series, Nia tries to get a loading zone permit for the restaurant. Notable guest appearances include Ken Campbell Rusty Schwimmer.
5. ""Big Night"" (4.5, 3/30/2003).  After Thomas foolishly tries to impress Gus by lying that he knows Pete Sampras, Nia, Voula and Nikki run into Yanni (himself) instead.
6. ""Nick Moves Out"" (4.5, 4/6/2003).  Tired of being taken care of, Nick decides to get an apartment of his own in spite of his parents' objections.
7. ""Greek Easter"" (3.5, 4/13/2003).  Nia wants to impress the family by cooking Easter dinner and surprising Gus with a surprise visitor.  Notable guest appearnace: John Aniston.

My overall rating for the short-lived TV series ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" is 3 out of 5 stars.  Had the same writing quality been applied to the TV series as the film, it would have likely been able to sustain better ratings and had more than 7 episodes.  Unfortunately, the series' two best episodes (#6 and #7) didn't appear until the number of viewers had dropped following several lackluster episodes and one terrible one.",1077494400,40,3240,4.955637707948244

1919957,1,B0000CGNEF,"Unlike one reviewer, I was not fortunate enough to be paid to watch this series, so I only managed three episodes before I realized I'd suffered enough. None of the irreverence and charm of the film translates to the small screen version. It's often true that the louder the laughtrack, the unfunnier the material, and the laughtrack for this series was as loud and annoying as in the heyday of Sherwood Schwartz (no, I'm not comparing this to ""Gilligan's Island"" or ""Green Acres,"" which were astoundingly intellectual and artistic compared to this series). I'm surprised the cast of veterans didn't realize how weak the writing was. I hope Nia Vardalos continues to find success in her writing and performing careers, but it will be no thanks to this turkey. John Corbett proves to be the wisest of the cast members, and I'm sure he's thrilled that contractual obligations found him elsewhere. Cynical network executives must think they can do no wrong by underestimating the intelligence and taste (indeed, the tolerance) of the television audience. This series, mercifully brief though it was, proves that they were WRONG. The Amazon synopsis includes the following information: ""This DVD will probably NOT be viewable in other countries."" Lucky them. There's already enough strife in this world without adding another empty-headed television series to it. Stay away at all costs!",1069977600,4,1383,5.151111111111111

1919959,1,B0000CGNEF,"After seeing the horrid previews for this show on commercials,all at once I hated it and wanted to watch every episode. I finally got that chance this week when the ENTIRE series was released on a single DVD. Ordinarily I would have said, ""You couldn't pay me to watch this garbage"" but then my boss at the video store did just that, considering it played on the tvs in the store all day. Believe me, you don't need to pay attention to catch all the witless 'humor' that is crammed in this trainwreck of a mis-match culture clash steriotype-based spin-off.
First of all the movie wasn't all it was hyped up to be. So this tv show is as if you took the original selling points of the movie that appeal to the mass of morons out there, but took out any bit of humor and decent acting or writing.
The only reason I am wasting my time writing this late night thrown together review is because I noticed there were no others. Why? Because me and my coworkers were the only people to ever watch the show.
From the unthinkabley humorless flash backs to Nia's childhood in the oddly bronze tinted greece that try to squeeze in what seems to be a shot at jokes, to the piss poor replacement for the leading male role from the movie, to the hackneyed and receycled bits from the movie, to the already worn thin appeal of the ultimate steriotypes for each character in her hilariously large greek family, this show was just waiting to be canceled. I can't say enough bad things about it, and I just cant find one good thing to say in its defense.
At least I can now say not only did I watch every painful episode, but i got paid for it. If only everyone in america had the same privledge maybe the show would still be on the air.",1069459200,9,1718,4.305555555555555
1919960,1,B0000CGNEF,"After the success of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", the success of ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" seemed almost assured.  More than 22 million people tuned in on the first night.  However, it barely managed to finish out its first season of 7 episodes before cancellation and spawned numerous ""What happened?"" articles throught the world of entertainment reporting come May.
So, in spite of this, the Columbia-Tri Star have pushed ahead with a DVD release of those seven episodes, possibly hoping to capitalize on the shreds of success still clinging to the name.  Maybe they're hoping that people who never heard of the TV series will pick up the DVD?
Well, I for one have to admit that morbid curiosity got the better of me, and I got the DVD yesterday to see if I'd missed anything after watching only the first two episodes in first-run.  Unfortunately, the answer is 'no'.  The lines are still as un-funny in the later episodes, the characters continue to mug for the camera just as much, and Steven Eckholdt continues to be an exceedingly mis-matched choice for Nia Varadalos's renamed character Nia.  To add insult to injury, there are no extras on the DVD worth mentioning, just a few trailers for other TV shows.
As with the release of ""Iron Chef USA"" on DVD, I really can't recommend this DVD to anyone that doesn't have a desire to own bad, failed programming.  I wish I could, since I like the characters, the actors, the concept, and even the idea of a TV show based on ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"".

1919961,1,B0000CGNEF,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a wonderfully funny movie, a romantic comedy classic, and creator/star Nia Vardalos should've left it alone. But no, she tried to milk the ""Greek Wedding"" cow for all it was worth and came up with this woefully unfunny---and completely unnecessary---TV series, ""My Big Fat Greek Life,"" which was promptly cancelled after only a handful of episodes (when asked why, the CBS president told TV Guide, ""Well, you saw the ratings, and you saw the show""). The charmingly funny Greek family from the movie was reduced to doing pathetic sitcom shtick for the TV series, and I knew that something was very wrong when Vardalos changed her character's name from Toula to her own real-life name of Nia. Can you say, ""ego""?You know what---I'll even go out on a limb and say that it was the TV show that costed Vardalos that much-deserved Academy Award for Best Screenplay for ""Wedding,"" as the Academy must've thought to themselves, ""We can't give an Oscar to something that's not good enough to win an Emmy."" What a terrible, terrible shame.
