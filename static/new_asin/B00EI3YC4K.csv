8605493,2,B00EI3YC4K,I ordered this for a few of my students and I almost gouged my eyes out. This is painfully tedious and repetitive. I haven't met one student that enjoyed this video.,1406332800,4,165,4.354838709677419
8605494,5,B00EI3YC4K,Its all about chord voicings and harmony. instead of learning a scale and hunting down the chord tones he teaches you to start with the absolute minimum (2 notes) and expands it throughout the dvd. this is an important dvd to me. i think everyone who owns a guitar should own this. i never felt i couldn't understand the material.,1392508800,6,330,4.516666666666667
