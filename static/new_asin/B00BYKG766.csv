8575625,3,B00BYKG766,Just very little about the actual designing and building of this amazing aircraft. Nothing said about how Tupolev spent years in Stalin's Gulag while designing this plane and what an amazing man he was. And nothing about how the French/British sabotaged the first official flight at the French Air Show where it crashed in spectacular and extreme circumstances.,1490400000,,361,5.241379310344827
