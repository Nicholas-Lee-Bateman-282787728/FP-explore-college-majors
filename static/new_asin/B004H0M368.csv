shock. I can listen with my 14 yo in the car.

A funny guy who happens to be black, but an American

that his tales are not all from one slice of life.",1332028800,,318,3.953125

I was unprepared for it, and didn't care for it. Disappointed. I was expecting more like what I saw of him on NBC, but I guess I forgot how much the censors change things for network TV.
