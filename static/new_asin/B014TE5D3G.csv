7422720,4,B014TE5D3G,"I am a huge fan of Tahmoh, and was thrilled to see him featured in a leading film role. The story certainly held my interest - while some twists were slightly predictable, some twists were unexpected. I was also really happy with the strong female roles in the movie.",1452643200,2,267,4.469387755102041
7422721,2,B014TE5D3G,"The DVD cover pretty much covers the entire plot. Major John Cafferty (Tahmoh Penikett) leads a group of military people on a top secret mission into an Afghanistan cave. They get out minus their memories of the event. Most of the film takes place in a hospital setting with the actual trip being a flashback.

If you look at the DVD cover you get to see what the ""otherworldly"" artifact looks like.

The film would have been better if there was less hospital time and more tunnel time. The finding of the object and much of the film was designed to be disjointed which didn't work too well. It ended as if they are going to generate a series...perhaps for SyFy. Mark acting and dialogue as ""needs improvement.""

7422756,1,B014TE5D3G,Boring!!! I have to stop watching after 30 min. Keep hoping it would get better but it did not. Safe yourself a dollar and buy a cheeseburger,1463616000,,141,4.2592592592592595
7422757,5,B014TE5D3G,Great packaging! Highly recommend! The DVD  is great. Thank You,1462320000,,63,5.3
7422758,3,B014TE5D3G,"It's an ok movie. Not great. Not bad. As a sci-fi it is a bit anticlimactic. You don't really see much of the sci-fi part until near the end. So if you are a sci-fi junkie, this isn't the movie for you. The plot isn't bad but isn't really thought out well either. For example, why would a retrieval team plan to kill most of its members before the target was actually acquired? It wouldn't. If you were that desperate to keep things hush hush you would kill the team after the target was acquired. But then I guess, most movies lack common sense to support their plot.",1460419200,5,568,4.268518518518518
7422759,3,B014TE5D3G,"Not bad a little weak in plot, did not like the special effects in regards to the gun fire.  Good cast.",1460419200,,103,3.9047619047619047
7422760,5,B014TE5D3G,Great item 100%AAA,1457568000,,18,5.333333333333333
7422761,4,B014TE5D3G,The other reviews did not do it justice. The movie was though provoking and interesting. Looked like another military thriller at first but with a twist and it did not end tragic with everybody dying like similar movies nowadays the actors did a pretty good job of the material. I also enjoy Tahmoh Penikett being a BSG fan and all of that.,1457481600,2,340,4.5

7422776,1,B014TE5D3G,"A really bad movie.
Can't even get the basics right.  There are too many inaccuracies that ruin the movie  This movie is about a squad of six US Marines.  The squad leader is a major...a major does not lead a squad, not now, not then, not ever.  Even worse is how they handle their weapons; kids right out of basic training know better technique.  They refer to their fellow Marines as soldiers.  This is absolutely absurd.  Marines are marines and soldiers are soldiers.  It is a big deal to those of us who have served.

The rest of the movie is just lame.  Evil government plot to exploit patriotic Marines who discover the plot just in time.",1455926400,3,645,4.435897435897436
7422777,5,B014TE5D3G,"Ok so maybe it's a bit predictable and the lead female was hard to understand at times, but i really enjoyed this movie. The story was good and I enjoyed the journey the characters took! I also thought Tahmoh Penikett did a fantastic job with a complicated character!",1455840000,,267,4.583333333333333

7422817,1,B014TE5D3G,What the ???? Wow. Most of this movie was talking and not that interesting. What a waste of money. I wish I could get a refund and my time back. Boring and an uninspired movie.,1453248000,3,176,4.057142857142857

7422819,5,B014TE5D3G,"Super entertaining and has a number of plot twists.  It's not an Oscar winner by any means, but if you're looking to enjoy one of those movies about a bunch of hot military types, this is a great one to check out.",1453075200,,213,4.071428571428571
7422820,5,B014TE5D3G,Great movie. I didn't see the end coming. Tahmoh Penikett and Colm Feore were solid. I won't provide spoilers though. Peter Winther directed. He's the same guy that did Independence Day and Stargate. Sci Fi - Classics! The story includes flashbacks as the plot unfolds. I'm surprised this didn't air in theaters or on the SciFi Channel at least. Any critic who doesn't appreciate it should be watching the Golf Channel instead of going to the movies. I'm glad I bought it.,1452729600,2,472,4.7682926829268295

8731798,4,B014TE5D3G,"Painkillers was shot in Canada with Canadian actors, I'm sure to keep the budget down. So there aren't any 'known names"" in the movie. It has the typical look for most Canadian movies, meaning that it was shot almost entirely indoors on what appear to be fairly cheap sets. The scenes shot in the mountains are well done. The acting was good when you take into consideration what the actors had to work with. Towards the end of the movie there are a couple of reveals that didn't really add to the movie.
I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it.",1498867200,,550,4.455445544554456

8731803,1,B014TE5D3G,"It would be so nice if writers and actors actually spent five minutes researching the characters they portray, same for directors.  Majors don't lead squads, Marines don't have long hair and beards and look like disaffectd little teenage punks who couldn't find their skateboards.  For Gods sake, get somebody that went to boot camp to spend five minutes teaching you the basics about the military, I've seen more weapons discipline with paintballers than I did in this supposed portrayal of Marines in combat.  Oh by the way, Marines are not called Soldiers, they don't wear bits and pieces of Army uniform with their Marine uniform.

This looks like it was written by someone who got their ""research"" from a computer game and a comic book.

The story line sort of drags along, too distracted by the actors who were too lazy to even get a decent military looking haircut; it grows back you know.",1475452800,,896,4.792207792207792
8731804,2,B014TE5D3G,"I had an epiphany during this movie. It is thus: no matter how much cash, you have, or how many actors you line up, if the writing is mediocre, the movie will be mediocre.

I'm glad lots of people made some cash from this, actors, etc.",1467331200,,235,4.108695652173913
