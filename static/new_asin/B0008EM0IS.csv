8055652,4,B0008EM0IS,"I think you definitely need to be very familiar with Quebecois culture to get into this film.  The premise is ""moving day"" - July 1st.  Most leases in Quebec begin and end on July 1st so there is always a tremendous frenzy, challenges finding a moving truck, things not going as planned... and this film focuses on a cast of characters as they negotiate all these things.  Having lived and moved in Montreal at the same age as the characters in the film it definitely struck a cord, but for someone who hasn't really experienced it I can't imagine this moving holding much interest.",1358640000,,582,4.576923076923077
