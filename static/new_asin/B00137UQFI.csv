8249432,5,B00137UQFI,"After learning the origin of The Midnight Lost Child, Yuji decides that he needs to train harder to protect himself. His new attitude creates a rift between Shana, Yoshida, and himself. Eita also distances himself after seeing Ogata's death. Even though she was able to be revived, the sight of his dying love leads him to abandon Marjorie. After some terrible experiences, the bonds that the group has built strengthen. The news about Yuji's unborn sibling also helps Yuji decide to stay in Misaki City. Just as he realizes this, and is about to choose between Yoshida and Shana, The Ball Masque appears. Hecate removes the Midnight Lost Child and uses it to awaken a giant monster. Marjorie, Wilhelmina, and Shana go to save him. But will they be able to prevent his disappearance?

The bulk of season 2 is spent on character development. That's a good thing in my book. The key to a truly great anime is character development and a great story. This anime has both. There are a few battles. The Caprice of Beauty, the one who created Yuji's treasure, arrives and presents a challenge. There is also another Crimson Denizen, called Sabrac. He shows up and nearly defeats his old rival Wilhelmina. Plus the epic final battle with Ball Masque. Shakugan No Shana has great animation, voice acting, characters, and a very good soundtrack. There is action, comedy, drama, romance, and suspense. This is an incredible anime. It has worked its way into my list of favorites, and I can't wait to see season 3. I think there's a lot to love here for every anime fan.",1355875200,,1559,4.731617647058823
