As they say it's amazing as to how much you learn by watching informative shows.",1281744000,,195,4.416666666666667
7904855,4,B000006QQZ,"I watched this video because I was looking for a video to show for a presentation on cencorship.  In that respect, I was not dissapointed.  A and E has created here a informative, to the point documentary on the battle between film makers and the ratings board to censor films.  On one hand, you have the always plausible argument of the right to free speech.  Filmmakers feel it is their right to create whatever art they feel like.  On the other hand, the argument that some things should be restricted to children is a sound one.  In the wake of Columbine, there is no doubt that the media has to be controlled somehow.  Even if it can't be proven that kids are taught to kill by media, we know for sure that they are influenced by it.  This video faulters in one area: production.  Despite the vast amounts of infomation thrown at you, it becomes tedious at times.  We don't see examples of things that are cut.  We don't hear what some of the actors feel.  But overall, it is a solid video for anyone interested in censorship or like me, anyone doing a presentation on it!",989884800,5,1077,4.411167512690355
