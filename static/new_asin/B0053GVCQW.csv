8455228,4,B0053GVCQW,"For starters if you're a UFO buff and hoping to hear and see more on that subject, look elsewhere.  This DVD solely focuses on the early projects that happened at Area 51.  A handful of men finally come forward and talk about the U2 spy plane, OXCART, and touch briefly on the early Stealth projects that went on at Groom Lake.  The former workers go in depth on what and why they worked on America's secret aircraft.  They also emphasized on the fact that they were (current workers as well) sworn to secrecy.  If programs do not become declassified they can NOT talk about anything that goes on out there.  The only time that UFOs are brought up are at the end of the DVD and one of the former workers says that other projects were going on as well as supposedly ""reverse engineering"" of alien space craft although he did not work on any himself.  If you're an aviation buff and/or find Area 51 interesting, pick up a copy.  It's very informative.  Enjoy.",1319760000,9,957,4.454022988505747
