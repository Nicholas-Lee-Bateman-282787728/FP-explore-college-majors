8715605,1,B004K8X0Z0,"While the serial itself is an enjoyable trip back to the cliffhanger chapter plays of the past, this 3-Disc Rocket DVD release (from Australia, the one with the awful cartoon cover art) is a real eyesore. The ""print"" used looks like a VHS bootleg of a 16mm print that was converted to a low-resolution AVI rip, uploaded to the internet, then downloaded by the grey-market video label (which is now defunct - surprise, surprise) and subsequently ""upconverted"" to standard-definition DVD format. It looks absolutely terrible, with gigantic pixels distracting the eye every frame of the way. Don't waste your time or the money on this import set.",1415750400,3,643,5.018691588785047
