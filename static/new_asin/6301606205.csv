7812860,5,6301606205,"This musical work by Scott Joplin must be hailed as one of the triumphs of the American stage.  An audience for this item would quickly develop if it was made available in DVD format.  It remains true to the composer's original intent, unlike so many other musical presentations these days.  The plot is simple, which is part of its charm.  The singers, dancers, musicians, and stage sets are uniformly excellent.  This item cannot be recommended enough.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable reminder of the live performance back in 1978.",1417910400,3,531,4.910112359550562
7812861,5,6301606205,Great opera.  Wonderful performance. Tape was in new condition.,1404777600,,63,6.0
7812862,5,6301606205,"The opera is a sweetly naive but intelligent wonder. The version of TREEMONISHA orchestrated by Gunther Schuller is so full of musical delights, the singing is so wonderful, the Houston Opera staging so inventive that it can be recommended without caveat.
What I am emphasizing here though, for theater people, is a look at the staged (with music) curtain call at the end. I have seen this sort of thing done so badly so often, it is a pleasure to see it done exactly right...perfectly paced while the audience goes crazy with delight...a model for stage directors !",1401926400,3,566,4.785714285714286
7812863,5,6301606205,"Absolutely worth the price - think what you'd pay for a seat at a live production.  I'm so happy to have been able to get a copy of this.  It needs to be on DVD and it needs to be performed live, often.  Not a clue why it isn't.",1375574400,,228,3.6122448979591835
7812864,5,6301606205,"Shameful that this work has been so neglected!!!!!

I am a life long opera addict.  Yet I can't think of a more joyful opera than this.  If I were Opera Czar, I would require it be shown in all schools.  Not just for the marvelous music and dancing, but also the morality.  Parson All talk can preach to me anytime.",1358467200,2,315,4.183333333333334
7812865,5,6301606205,"Another perfect example of Mr. Joplin's pure genius.  My opinion is this opera rivals any presented and written anywhere; for example, Aida, Samson et Dalila, Un Ballo in Maschera, and all others.  The performers are of the highest quality and talent in this particular presentation is at the highest level.  I agree with another reviewer... Treemonisha should be a regular presentation in every opera company from Europe to the U.S.  If this happens it would be Europe before the U.S.  We still have too many ""hangups"".

This is truly an American opera; it was written in America by an American whose roots are purely of America.  This makes me extremely proud.",1318809600,5,662,4.90990990990991
7812866,5,6301606205,"I first saw this on Broadway, and was pretty much blown out of my seat. Unfortunately, it opened during a newspaper strike, got very little publicity, and closed almost immediately.
I then lucked out in finding a new VHS copy on a Barnes and Noble clearance table, grabbed it up, and have watched it numerous times since. I continue to be a sobbing
wreck each time I view it, it's such a slice of sheer brilliance.
Houston Grand Opera: PLEASE release this on DVD!!!",1271894400,10,465,4.5476190476190474
7812867,5,6301606205,"I am a musician with over 50 years doing all manner of gigs; this is my single most favored work of art. Any serious opera company should have this work in their repertory......it burns the soul in a tie with Verdi and the rest. I have heard almost all of them at the Met and elsewhere, but this one sticks in the head only like Magic Flute and it's peers.",1179014400,17,356,4.1
