4378736,4,B004HPOTZ6,Movie gives good insight into the selection process. It is one thing to read about it in a book and another to actually see the process.,1317686400,7,136,4.269230769230769
4378777,5,B004HPOTZ6,"Great show, very insightful. I Loved it so much on Netflix that I bought this off of Amazon. Very interesting, and even my non-military family found it quite intriguing.",1374537600,3,169,4.862068965517241
4378778,4,B004HPOTZ6,"This was an eye-opener for me. Informative, though limited to what a short video can cover. REally a good introduction. This will spur me on to do more research on the training of Special Forces soldiers.",1374278400,4,204,4.694444444444445
4378779,4,B004HPOTZ6,My husband said this DVD really shows you what the Navy Seals go through in their training.  It makes you appreciate them even more when you see what it takes to be a Navy Seal.,1363305600,,177,4.057142857142857
4378780,5,B004HPOTZ6,"if you want to know what the green berets go through to get the tab, watch this video. its graphic and raw. it will make you realize just how easy waking up in the morning actually is. you get to see the emotion and physical stages these men go through in their 2 week training program. some will receive it and some will not, but they all emerge as brothers. buy this and you will be impressed.",1361145600,6,395,4.142857142857143
4378781,5,B004HPOTZ6,"Got this in and I was really excited to see it and I wasn't dissapointed! The stuff our soldiers go through is amazing and as newly signed 18x, it was something that scares me and excites me all at once!

If you're someone who's going into the Army and you want to see what selection will be like, check this out, if you're a civilian, this will give you a whole new reason to respect our troops!",1357084800,,396,4.142857142857143
4378782,5,B004HPOTZ6,"Very well done doc,  taking you inside the making of warriors. Puts you right in the middle of the action. you'll see first hand what it takes to become the elite of the elite.",1335484800,,176,4.176470588235294
4378783,5,B004HPOTZ6,My son finished the 19 day Selections in January and passed so i wanted to see what he'd been through. The documentary is excellent and gives you an all new respect for our soldiers. What they do is incredible and everyone should watch it. If you're a parent I recommend watching it after your son finishes the course.,1332547200,,318,4.5
4378784,5,B004HPOTZ6,"Saw this on Discovery, then Netflix, then I downloaded a digital copy onto my phone. As a prospective 18 X-Ray (hopefully Delta), I found this DVD enlightening and inspiring. I can't wait for SFAS.",1326326400,,197,4.823529411764706
4378785,5,B004HPOTZ6,"My son just called to let me know that he successfully completed SFAS (which now lasts three weeks instead of two weeks).  He also suggested that I watch this video, because he said it's ""pretty accurate"" about what he's just been through.  The training is even tougher now, and that's as it should be.  Of his initial cadre of 330, only 130 were selected.  He is a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan (sergeant in the Army) and I'm really proud of him.  Here's a warning, though, for all the moms and dads out there: if your son is going to SFAS, watch this video AFTERWARDS.  His three weeks in hell are also your three weeks in hell... wondering, hoping, praying, and worrying. I'm so glad that he was wise enough not to mention it to me beforehand!  Excellent video.",1321660800,36,771,4.464285714285714
4378786,5,B004HPOTZ6,"Great Video - Great Price - Great Speed.  Thanks all the way around.  A well made documentary that really gets across all the ""hell"" they have to go through just to get in.  Amazing.

UPDATE:  I gave this video to my son for Christmas.  He opened it to play it a couple of days later.  It was cracked from the center all the way to the edge making it unplayable.  I didn't ask for a refund as I purchased it in October and he didn't even open it until late December.  But it is kind of a shame, we were both really looking forward to watching this great documentary.",1318982400,4,566,4.1192660550458715

8429670,4,B004HPOTZ6,"260 wanna-be Green Berets show up for two weeks of exercises to see if they are capable of wearing the green beret. They begin with pushing a log around and then rolling around on the ground.  Soon candidates get physically ill and hurt.

They carry a 50 lb back pack and aspire to do night navigation. As the tasks continue guys leave/quit. an obstacle course to weed out phobias.

After 7 days 1/3 are gone. They break up into four teams for difficult missions.

Concludes with who made it. There is a year of training, only 25 percent make that.

The testing will be extended to three weeks. Some try 2 or 3 times. Insightful. Swearing bleeped.",1431302400,,647,4.495726495726496
