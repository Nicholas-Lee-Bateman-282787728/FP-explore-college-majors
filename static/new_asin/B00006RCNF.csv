1788083,5,B00006RCNF,"It is interesting to read what other people have said about this DVD.  I agree with some of the comments from reviewers who have given it fewer stars but I gave it five stars because I use it a lot and because I think it deserves a five star rating for being a highest quality presentation and very useful.  I do not recommend it for rank beginners.  Anyone interested in yoga should try to take a class or workshop from a certified instructor and not just rely on videos.  If you do teach yourself from videos though, get several.  Living Arts (now known as Gaiam) has some good ones.  This DVD is a good supplement to a do-at-home yoga regime.

You can use this video for short or long programs.  It's easy to select a program.  Some of them target specific areas of the body (for example neck, arms and abs, spine, feet, hands, legs and hips).  There are a lot of different postures covered in the video, some I've never seen anywhere such as hand or eye or feet exercises and, one of my favorites, the seven easy pieces.  This DVD has headstands on it which none of my other ones do.  There are lots of seated, stretching postures and standing postures.  Sun salute, moon salute, and heroes sequence are covered, but only gone through once on each side.  You can repeat them if you're quick with the remote, though, and don't mind hearing all of the same instructions over again.

There are a couple of meditation segments that she talks you through.  These are kind of nice if you don't mind being talked to during meditation.  Also there are special exercise sequences for ""that time of the month"" which is a pleasant feature.

There aren't many instructions about breathing.  If you are a beginner you probably won't miss them.  I may get shouted out of the yoga community for seeming to suggest that correct breathing isn't an essential part of yoga; shout away.  People will breathe anyway.  Anyone familiar with yoga will know how to breathe.  So, this video doesn't cover breathing well.

Be warned.  Some of the reviewers have said that you could hurt your back.  They are telling the truth, but you can hurt your back from every single yoga video out there if you try to copy the demonstrator.  The instructor on this video tells you with her voice how far to go.  Maybe she could scream and shout to make it a little clearer, but we do have brains of own . . .

You don't have to watch the disclaimer that shows up after you've selected your workout.  Just press the ""next"" button on your remote.  Practice using your remote with this DVD because you will find that you can skip a posture and repeat a posture, but once it has passed to the next one you can't go back to it.

Main weaknesses as far as I'm concerned:  relaxation poses at the end are too short and she talks through them.  I don't like that, but when she's done there's a music loop that's fairly long (for a loop) you can use to relax in peace a little longer.  I wish there was a printed copy of what's in each program because it isn't always easy to remember where some of my favorites are.  You'll have the DVD a long time, though, so you will eventually become familiar with the names of your favorite programs.",1068163200,59,3196,4.421955403087479
1788084,5,B00006RCNF,"This just offers tremendous value for the money, because it has so many workouts, and they are all good, and tailored to fit various needs:  sore neck, stress, stiff back, hands and feet, etc.  It also has a bunch of different levels.  I thought it was much better than most Yoga tapes in terms of addressing the needs of beginners, but I haven't been a beginner in some time, so maybe I'm wrong. That issue aside, this is the best Yoga DVD to own--and beyond the variety it offers, I think JJ Gormley has a wonderful soothing voice, and gives great instruction to follow the movements--I never get confused the way I do with Quick Fix Power Yoga where I have to constantly look at the screen to figure out what they're doing.",1061769600,26,726,4.443609022556391
1788085,5,B00006RCNF,"This is a great DVD.  I use more of the beginning exercises, since I am not very flexible, and I love the teachers soothing voice and gentle demeanor.  I use it most in the morning to gently wake up  before the kids wake up and I have to go to work.  It has helped me with my back since the gentle movements help with my circulation and warm up my body before the chaos of the day begins.  I highly recommend it.",1060819200,3,412,3.975609756097561
1788086,5,B00006RCNF,"I've had this DVD for about a month and have been using it two or three times a week.  I've been trying tapes and about a dozen classes over 6 months but it's never really clicked for me so I'm still a yoga beginner.  This program is so different from anything else I've used that it took me a few times to get use to it, but now, I won't go back to a traditional yoga video.  Yoga For Every Body gives me so many options - no matter what my mood, energy level or what my body needs, I can find a workout on this disc that's appropriate and beneficial.  I also love that the instructor really takes time with each and every pose.  The cues to breathe deeply and the reminders to only go as far as your body wants to today, all add to the true spirit of yoga that this program embodies.",1058918400,22,785,4.006410256410256
1788087,5,B00006RCNF,This Yoga for EveryBody is worth your money. It has the different programs that will suit everybody's needs. I'm one of those who easily lose motivation when I'm doing same exercise everyday. When this DVD at hand I can pick which body part to work on and the level that fits my energy for the day.,1058400000,4,298,4.339285714285714
1788088,5,B00006RCNF,"I just recieved this item last week.  So far I am loving it.  It has 9 routines under 30 minutes and 9 over, all for beginners, and then you can work up to intermediate and advanced.  I love that it is an item I can grow with and will change with me.  I also love that I can do a different routine for different times in my day (Good Morning, Preparing for Meditation).  Some of the routines are challenging, and I consider myself somewhat flexible, but as long as you expect to not be an expert right off, you'll be ok.  I definetly will recommend this one!",1058313600,4,558,4.168224299065421
1788089,5,B00006RCNF,"I really love this video.  I didn't know much about yoga before I got this besides taking a few classes.  The classes I took were all too fast and seemed more like an aerobics workout and I felt lost. This DVD gives a wide range of instruction allows me to proceed at my own pace and level, though I don't think I'll be doing the more advanced workouts for some time. The presentation is straightforward without a lot of frills.  But if you're not looking for frills, just a good yoga instructional DVD this one's for you.",1057708800,5,522,4.360824742268041
1788090,5,B00006RCNF,"I am a beginner in the wide world of yoga. I took a class this semester with an instructor who really views yoga as a way of life, and his gentle approach got me hooked.  Up until now I've been sticking with supplementing the class with the Living Arts AM & PM yoga set which is fantastic, but when the class started I wanted to get something longer to sort of replace it.  I chose this and could not have done better.
The dvd is divided by levels and times, so there is ample oportunity for plenty of variety.  I love the instructor encouraging and understanding manner ""Go as far as your legs want to go today"" etc.  They also show modifications with props if you are less flexible.
Understand that the way the variety is created is each pose or series is put on the dvd as a separate chapter and then when you chose a routine you get a preprogramed set of poses&series, so it is not a set of individually created workouts but rather different mixtures from a common bag.  However there are enough poses there that it does not feel repetitive.
All in all if you were to purchase one yoga dvd, I would highly recommend this one.",1050883200,178,1129,4.306603773584905
1788091,5,B00006RCNF,"This DVD was a great buy.  40 workouts on ONE DVD.  You will never get bored.  The beginner sections are just that, and the advanced has 1 or 2 pretty tough workouts.  I like the pace of this DVD,what I would describe as steady.  There is a pause between each pose with the name of the pose in sanskrit, this makes it very doable even when in the midst of all the standing poses(advanced)...My husband LOVES it as well and he is a RANK beginner who easily gets discouraged.  The instructor is peacful, and gives detailed instruction..Some of the poses like shoulder stand she instructs for too long after the first 1 or 2 times through the DVD, so I just fast forward to the next pose.
I wish that maybe a power yoga DVD would be put out in the same scheme as this one, with multiple workouts.  If they do that I will be buying it in a hurry...This is a great workout...I will be purchasing more difficult POWER YOGA DVDS for a more aggressive cardio workout...Although this WILL get your heart pumping(the 70 min advanced workout is pretty tough) Don't expect Ashtanga practice.  This is more Iyengar based yoga.  All levels will be happy with this DVD, but understand that if you are a beginner and your girlfriend wants to do this workout with you and she is advanced you will have to do differnt workouts.  It simply has 12 workouts for Beginner, 12 for intermediate and 12 (or 14) for advanced.  No way to make the beginner sections ADVANCED, just better to do the advanced workout.",1047600000,41,1487,4.470370370370371

1788154,2,B00006RCNF,I liked that this DVD has a variety of options but I have to say I was turned off by the instructor.  She's slow in some parts and too fast in others.  The quality of the video is not very good and to be honest it's boring.  She's not very inspiring or uplifting and she looks bored the whole time.  One of the other reviewers said her voice was annoying and monotonous and I have to agree.  I really wanted to like this for the variety but she's just so boring.,1431561600,3,462,4.032967032967033

1788172,1,B00006RCNF,"I wish I could give this a better rating.  Yes, there are many different choices of types of yoga on this DVD.  However, there are no transitions between poses.  It will jump from one position and go straight into the other pose without showing any transition.  This made it completely impossible to follow.  I don't even use the DVD anymore, a waste of my money.",1421625600,,363,4.523076923076923
1788173,5,B00006RCNF,"This is one of my ""go to"" yoga videos and that is saying a lot. I have about 20 yoga video and I love them all for one reason or another, so I keep them all around. But this one, is especially good because it allows me to select exactly what I'm in the mood for at the time. It can be an advanced workout for an hour, or a beginner workout for 30 minutes. If my back hurts, I pick a routine to stretch my spine, if my neck hurts, I select a routine guaranteed to ease my neck. If I want to get energized, I pick a routine for that, and if I want to relax -- well you guessed it. Unlike other dvds where all the warm ups and cool downs use the same segment, this DVD has numerous shavasana routines for example. Its fun to see which routine she ads to each total workout.

Her voice is soothing, she shows modifications, she isn't pushy -- she's very zen.  I love this one!",1421539200,6,872,3.9488636363636362

The workouts are clearly targeted to what one wishes to accomplish on any particular day. Good investment",1402790400,3,362,4.950819672131147
1788200,4,B00006RCNF,"I like this yoga DVD. Considering it is the first yoga DVD I have ever purchased, I think it's decent. My main problem with this DVD is the fact there is no warm up included. The first time I did one of the advanced sequences, I didn't warm up and woke up incredibly sore the next morning. It's absolutely imperative that you remember to warm up on your own before starting any of the sequences on this DVD. I also really dislike the names given to some of the sequences on this DVD. I like boring names that tell me exactly what I'll be doing in a sequence before I do it. Some of the names like ""Dealing with change"" and ""Wringing out the old"" are so vague that I haven't even bothered to try them yet. Maybe that's because I'm not really concerned with the spiritual side of yoga but I find it rather annoying. I don't want to wake up in the morning and then have to spend 15 minutes fast forwarding through a sequence just to find out what poses are in it.

But, it's still a good DVD. I really like how there are multiple sequences at multiple levels that take different amounts of time. Sometimes I don't feel like doing yoga for an hour, sometimes I feel like doing something more challenging. I really appreciate having options to choose from. I don't mind the fact that there are black screens in between each pose. It's very easy, I feel, to figure out your own transitions for each pose and the black screens keep me from feeling as rushed when I'm doing the poses (as I sometimes feel in physical classes).

All in all, I'm glad I bought this DVD. I think it was a good purchase considering it's the start of a collection I hope to expand. I has a lot of sequences to choose from, which was my main reason for buying it in the first place and it has met all of my expectations. I would recommend this DVD to others despite the few flaws I have mentioned here.",1399075200,5,1871,4.252808988764045

Sometimes I felt like they were too easy to do much good.  I was wrong!  I'm already stronger and much more flexible.  If I had to find a fault with this DVD, it would be that she doesn't always remind you to when to inhale and when to exhale, like most Yoga DVDs I've had.  But that's really not much of a problem.

I can do a different one everyday if I want, depending on how I'm feeling and/or my goals and/or time limits.

1788265,3,B00006RCNF,"On the plus side, this is filmed with a relaxing scene of a mansion cum temple and flickering candles. The music is nice. The instructor is wearing clothing that easily reveals a properly-done pose. Its beneficial that each post is named both in English and its native title on the screen. ALSO, she has the most thorough instruction of corpse post I have EVER encountered on a DVD. The biggest plus is that there are tons of routines on this disc - yes, poses recycled into new practices, but routines which include ones which are short, ones which are long, ones called ' yoga for arms, wrists and shoulders,''opening your heart to change,' and 'for the menstruating woman.' So, as such, I may add this to my list to purchase later on - in a couple of years or so, when I consider myself intermediate to advanced in yoga, for.....
1 She uses esoteric instructions which I'd really have to meditate on, and work at to get/make work for me, such as 'move your hip points away from one another....'
2 She moves quickly through the instructions, as well as, both in and out of poses.
3 She doesn't retain a pose very long.
4 Some of the poses, I feel, are a bit advanced with such quick, hard-to-understand instruction.
5 A practice can be a bit choppy. Within the routine, some poses are part of a 2-3 pose sequence, but the sequences do not flow together. Rather, there are gaps and not-flowing transitions.

All round, this video is good for prepping for an advanced yoga class in my opinion. But, it's still above my head.",1381104000,2,1524,4.521739130434782
1788266,5,B00006RCNF,"I loved this one because I could choose what level and what area to focus  on. I also liked that she didn't try and talk while making the positions, but she voiced over instead. The set up of this video is organized so that you can choose what level is best and what workout in each level is best for your body. I also appreciated the intro that she does at the beginning. She explains that you should NOT try and do exactly what you see her doing if you are a beginner, but that you should do the level that your body feels best at. For a beginner yoga girl, that made all the difference. I understood what level to work at and felt successful at that level.",1376956800,2,659,4.108527131782946

There are no transitions between the different poses that she has you do, the screen just changes and shows the name of the new pose. This means that you quickly go from kneeling to standing to sitting. I like more flow with my yoga, and while there are many different routines to use, they also repeat the poses and are exactly the same.",1374192000,2,492,4.135416666666667

There is a beginning, intermediate and advance section that all have many different workouts to do.  (Each level is also broken down into time.  Beginner over and under 30 minutes for instance, and each has a few different things to do)

I thought this dvd would be a good place to start based on the title and reviews I read.  I chose a 30 minute beginner's sequence to start with.  Within 10 minutes I was totally frustrated.  I finally gave up during a ""lunge"" that I couldn't believe was for beginners.  The only mention made of how to modify was to use blocks.  But how?  And I didn't know I'd need equipment to do the dvd!  Maybe I'll try another sequence, but I don't hold out much hope.",1362441600,3,583,4.275229357798165

The surrounding is downright depressing, instructions are poor, there is NO flow in the videos, no imagination, no ... nothing. It is like reading a book on how to do yoga poses. Read the title on the pose first, do it (SLOWLY) on the left side, do it on the right  side. Turn the page (analog of black screen on the video). Read the next title... so on.
The ""challenging"" parts are not challenging at all. The overall tempo might suit the beginning student, but the atmosphere will negate the advantage. I wish I could un-see it.",1362096000,2,658,4.43801652892562

And the slowness is a good change of pace, allows you to use the proper form for each pose. I highly recommend to beginners and people who want a break from the more power yoga programs out there, which can get draining.

There were so many workouts to choose from that I liked the variation and the different levels. It was a great way to start the practice.  Now that I have been doing it for several months and have taken up the practice more, I have other dvds too. This is still one that I keep going back to because of it's variations in workouts and I love her cueing and reminding me to relax my jaw! :)  I will however agree with people that the flow from one exercise to the next is not necessarily the greatest, and I imagine if you are someone who wants to hold poses for extended periods of time, this wouldn't be for you.

The segments do not flow from one to another, e.g. one segment could end in a standing position, the screen blacks out, for a split second, and the next segment begins in a position of being on all fours (on hands and knees) without a yoga flow into the position (how did she get from standing to being on all four's?).  I prefer a flow from one position to the next when moving on to a different segment during the same program.  The yoga is presented in a fragmented way.",1348012800,3,621,4.421052631578948

1788348,5,B00006RCNF,"I love this DVD. Out of a handful of yoga, Pilates and dance workout discs that I own it's the only one that gets consistently used over and over again, years after I bought it. This is primarily because I can match its versatile menu of workouts to my mood *and* my ability level. As a novice I have not just one ""beginner"" routine but a number of them targeting different areas of the body and for different lengths of time -- an embarrassment of riches.

The music is soothing and unobtrusive, the instructor has a pleasant calm voice, and the instructions are matter of fact and clear. There are helpful and relevant tips (""the stretch should be in the inner thigh, not the knee; if you feel the stretch in the inner knee, back off and bend the knee"") without a lot of metaphysical babble. I was a total beginner to yoga when I got the DVD and I found it perfectly clear to follow along and learn.

I do the Good Morning routine almost every day. In 25 minutes it stretches and refreshes me, gently, without making me feel like I ran a marathon first thing in the morning.",1333411200,6,1076,4.348258706467662
1788349,4,B00006RCNF,"This DVD has a good introduction to body awareness and then goes into routines for beginner, intermediate, and advanced practitioners.  I find JJ Gormley's cueing excellent, although I prefer reverse cueing so the student can mirror the instructor.  But her guidance through posture, alignment, and relaxation is outstanding.

Each routine is broken into segments, which is great for learning poses, but lacking in flow, or vinyasa yoga.  Some poses end seated while the next begins standing, a bit disruptive to the meditation.  And some of the intermediate and advanced routines do not have enough warm-up, especially if you're doing them right after waking up.

The relaxation and meditations at the end of each routine are terrific.  All in all, a great introduction to yoga poses.",1331856000,4,785,5.232

Because of this format though, transitions between poses are pretty choppy, and there is no warmup or meditative beginning to the ones I have tried so far.

There is a short interview and also a lesson about the basics of yoga that you can look at from the main screen.  Good information.

Then you select from one of three levels, beginners, intermediate and advanced with choices of under or over 30 minutes for the beginner and under and over f45 or the other levels.

There are 6-9 routines in each section and range from meditative practices to ones that are more active with a wide range of poses thoughout.  The poses are also changed for the levels, for instance the Sun Salutation is not the same on the 3 levels, each one is different and as you would guess, increase in challenge.

Between the general practices, the focused practices (like for you arms or legs) and the levels, makes it a worthwhile video to have.",1328486400,3,996,4.5

My main complaint is that given the modular format of this DVD, it would have been good to get a list of the sequence of poses/flows.

This one seems to be somewhere in the middle.  I have done most of the intermediate and a few of the advanced routines and although some are a bit slow, it does give you a good stretch and raises your heart rate a bit.  would i buy it again?

I started with the under 30 minute beginner routines and have worked up from there and been very pleased with how it has been going.",1314403200,2,344,4.276923076923077
1788458,5,B00006RCNF,"I'm a beginner yogi who is in good physical shape.  This video has all the right moves that fits me comfortably well.  I highly recommend it.  It's easy to follow, good narratives, and very relaxing to listen to.",1313452800,3,212,4.526315789473684
1788459,4,B00006RCNF,"This video is quite good.  The instructors/narrators are nice and give you good instruction.  There are soo many routines available too for beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  All three have options for under 30 minute routines and over 30 minute routines, which is great for any schedule.  There are general workouts and then ones that are more specific (back, neck, legs, arms, etc).  I am happy with my purchase.  My only issue is that the woman doing the yoga never smiles.  She doesn't seem happy to be doing her yoga.  Its not necessary but it would be nice.  The narrator is friendly and encouraging though.",1312588800,2,617,4.855769230769231
1788460,1,B00006RCNF,"Would not even recommend this video to a beginner.  The transitions are awful from pose to pose.  Example: Going back to table after a series that ends in Warrior 1.  Good way for a beginner to injure themselves.  They filmed each series of two or three poses individually, so then after a short series there is a black screen and the woman is miraculously back to table pose.  Not good.  Start with Shiva, don't waste your money here.",1311897600,21,435,4.512820512820513

1788462,5,B00006RCNF,"I've had this DVD for several weeks now, and felt the need to say how great it is! A few reasons it's excellent:
1. The instructor. I find her down to earth, and very knowledgeable. Some yoga dvds feature impossibly flexible, young bombshells. J.J. is much more relateable to me, and she just strikes me as someone who has perfected her craft.
2. The flexibility of the menu. This is just an awesome aspect of this dvd. Being able to choose a routine based on the amount of time you have to practice is a huge boon. It removes a huge stumbling block from most exercise dvds. For example, this morning I had a short amount of time to practice - and I was able to do a simple 20 minute routine before work.
3. The routines themselves. They vary from easy to more difficult - I think this is a great DVD for anyone, from a total beginner to an advanced pupil. And the flexibility allows you to move in between as the day calls for it.",1307404800,4,931,4.235955056179775
1788463,3,B00006RCNF,"...seems to enjoy these routines ever so often. I would prefer something even more basic, but this will suffice in the meantime.",1307059200,,128,4.863636363636363
1788464,5,B00006RCNF,"This DVD is just what I have been looking for:

1. Variety. Some days I feel better than others. One day I might feel beginner another day I might feel intermediate (don't QUITE feel advanced yet hehe). One day I might be feeling like a mighty beginner ready for half an hour plus of yoga. Other days perhaps not. There are all of those options on this DVD. Within each option there are alternatives also given to better fit your body and level of flexibility. One thing I was really pleased by (sorry in advance to the guys) is that there is a ""menstruation"" routine. When you have back pain and cramp pain, it's such a simple but effective routine to give some relief and make you feel limber and calm.

2. Narrator's voice. If there is one thing that totally kills a yoga DVD for me, it's if the narrator's voice is irritating or is not soothing. Her voice is perfect and totally relaxing and gentle.

3. Detail. In yoga (along with martial arts and other disciplined activities) I feel like concentration and precision of movement is so extremely important. This isn't one of those DVDs that just tells you to bend sideways and stretch your arm up. It goes through every sensation, position, and direction that every body part should be in. What I ESPECIALLY love is that she also reminds you of a set of basic things during every pose (I don't know if others might find it annoying). I am the type of person who, when I am exerting myself and concentrating on performing, will always subconsciously do things I am ""not supposed to""; for example I'll scrunch up my forehead, or start to hunch my shoulders, or drop my head. She reminds you with every post to relax your forehead, roll your collarbones up to the ceiling, etc etc. By the time you accomplish the pose and address all of those little issues, you are thinking ""cool I bet I look pretty pro right now"" hahaha. Or maybe just I think that.

4. Price. What more can I say? It is a great deal. Cheaper than going to yoga studios and less of a pain in the butt since you can do it at home.

They aren't kidding when they say it is yoga for every body, it really is (unless you can't bend any of your joints or something). And not only just different people, but the different states your body might be in on any particular day. Really really awesome DVD when you come home from work stressed out, are having your (uh oh) menstrual cycle, are feeling stiff, or just can't get your head straight. Believe it or not, I even turn to this yoga DVD after a great show and getting my butt kicked in a mosh pit all night (not joking hehe). Ever body could use a dose of this yoga",1305417600,4,2632,4.352342158859471
1788465,5,B00006RCNF,I am a busy Mom who has to get her child ready for school and get herself ready for work in the morning. I really enjoy practicing the routines first thing in the morning.  It calms me down and gets me ready for a busy day ahead.  I like the variety and the fact that you can work at your own level.,1303257600,4,299,3.806451612903226
1788485,5,B00006RCNF,"I got this DVD a few months ago, after I had ordered several others and was not able to incorporate them in my daily routine. I have a busy schedule and sometimes I can devote an hour or more to my practice, and some days it has to be 20 or 30 min only, in the morning or evening. This DVD gives an opportunity to choose a routine depending on the time available and even the parts of the body you want to exercise. It leaves me with virtually no excuse to skip the practice :-) I love the way J.J. guides me through the practice, in her quiet and caring voice, correcting my postures and breathing, always to the point, as if she is present in the room or watching me from the screen. Comparing to the obnoxious and annoying commentary some other DVDs provide, listening to J.J. brings peace and joy while exercising. I agree that some more advanced practitioners might look for a more intense routine, but for an ordinary person who does not spend 3 hours a day folding herself into a pretzel, this is an excellent exercise tool and a pleasure to begin or end the day. One more thing: the segments do have breaks in between, but the postures follow each other smoothly and if you hold your posture during that split of a second, you will easily perform your routine in a flowing Vinyasa way. After doing a routine a couple of times, you know what posture to expect next and stop noticing the breaks. Thank you, J.J., great job!",1302566400,6,1429,4.355805243445693
1788486,5,B00006RCNF,"This is a fantastic yoga DVD. I was a little concerned after reading the reviews, regarding the way the video jumped between poses, but it's not a problem at all. There's plenty of time to adjust your pose before the sequence gets going, and it's not unlike what would happen in an actual class anyways. The variety of routines is excellent. The voice-over explaining what to do is good, allows you to follow along even if your pose keeps you from seeing the tv screen. I'm not sure this would be a good video if you are jumping into yoga without ever having taken a class, but if you have taken a few classes, this video is fantastic. Highly recommend it, and will consider buying other videos in this series.",1302220800,5,710,4.469230769230769

You can choose from many, many workouts according to how you feel or how much time you have. I do a workout every day and still get surprised.
On the not so hot side: the scenery is not as hip and chique as other workout DVDs.
A PLUS PLUS: I have been doing yoga for many years with multiple instructors. The VERBAL DIRECTIONS the teacher gives you in this DVD rank top on my instructors list. She is constantly giving you very specific cues about where it should be felt, how to get in and out of the poses, etc, which makes it perfect for both beginners and advanced students wanting to improve their practice.",1298246400,4,776,4.395833333333333

Sometimes I go for months and just do my own routine and then I go back and start using this one again as is or with my own modifications. My first copy wore out so I am ordering a new one. However, I do recommend taking a few classes with a certified yoga instructor before using a DVD. Breathing, posture, and abdominal control may best be learned from a qualified instructor. Some yoga instructors are good; others not so good. The DVD is consistent. The ability to select the level and/or time is great. Although it is ideal to do an hour of yoga a day, life seems to get in the way. So it is nice to have the options of different time periods, as well as routines.

1788511,5,B00006RCNF,"This is the third time I've bought this cd - i keep giving it away to friends who find it as wonderful as I do.  I don't think that doing this yoga program will help you lose weight - there's no cardio, of course, and nothing that curbs your appetite.  What it does do, however, is put you in touch with your body in ways that many overweight and non-flexible or non-active  people need.

The scenery is gorgeous, the music is fine.  The poses and movements are slow and there's enough time for you to adjust and experiment with the stretch and balance.  This is great, because, as many of us know, if you push to just inside the limits of a stretch, and then just breathe in it, you can, a minute later, stretch a bit further.  Too many yoga videos move you too quickly to really do that.

 I LOVE her reminders about what to be doing with each of your body parts in a pose, because I have a tendency to focus, for example, on one leg and not the other in the standing poses.

Within about 4 sessions of the program, I felt suddenly much stronger and more balanced overall, both in the poses and during the day.  Where I couldn't do a balance movement at all, I suddenly could.  My friends have had the same experience - it's that fast.

This remains my go-to video for a nice yoga session involving focused breathing and good stretch and balance.  No  bells and whistles, no fancy stuff - just good, solid mindful movement and stretch.  Can't miss.",1296864000,,1450,4.314814814814815

There are many sections to choose from, so you will not grow tired of the DVD for a long time. The weakness of this disc is the poor production/editing. They could've used better lighting, outfit for the instructor (the only person in the video), and transitions between segments. All these elements make the product seem outdated and a bit cheap.

Perhaps it is because I am used to more of a flow style of yoga, this video is more 'downward facing dog' then you hold it for a few breaths and then 'seated twist' comes on and you do that for a few breaths. There are a lot of different options of routines but none of them flow. The ab routine is just a lot of twists and I have yet to feel challanged on any of the poses or workouts. I have a horrible work schedule of having to do 12 hour shifts and I am only able to work out on my days off and I want those workouts to count and I have never felt that I am getting a good workout with this dvd.

The flow routine and general routines are also very good.  J.J. gives great instructions for how to enter each pose and get the most out of the stretch. The one negative is that there are times when she doesn't hold each pose long enough!

It is also done in real time so that she is doing the actions with you for the length of time she wishes you to hold the positions.  I suggest that before you do a new sequence you watch it first so that you know whether you need blocks, belt etc to be handy nearby.

She is encouraging and offers different options depending on your current flexibility - she also often reminds you to listen to your own body and not to over stretch yourself or ask too much too soon of your body.

I am using this about 4 times a week alone at home as there are no convenient classes nearby - and I am reaping visible benefits.  It is also good value for money and not gimmicky.  Although she is a lot slimmer and fitter than me - you do not feel that you have an instructor who is posing and loving herself during this dvd.

The only downside for me was I had a bit of sorting to do as I am in Europe and this is set up for the USA area when running it in your hardware.

1788532,3,B00006RCNF,"Strengths:

Exercise series for of various time lengths for
Beginner(I haven't viewed those)
Intermediate
Advanced

These segments include a wide range of asanas if you posses diverse goals, and the asanas allow you to combine various routines during the week so you can stretch various muscle groups.

The advanced asanas (perhaps int.to, I don't remember) feature a workout for the week of menstruation.

The instructor is a normal looking lady, who does not look like the barbie/model that usual yoga DVDs feature. She is fit, but not perfect.

Some viewers might not enjoy the low production value of the DVD. It features a loan instructor who appears in front of a blue drape that looks like the producers have pinned to the wall. Also a cheap vase of (fake?) flowers sits behind her. The video looks a bit grainy, and sound quality is not all that good.

However, on the other hand, it is nice to see that other film groups besides well funded large production companies are out there making low rent yoga instructional DVDs instead of splashy DVDs with celebrities.

Weaknesses:

All exercise segments do not provide adequate warm-ups, so you go right into the asanas. Many of the poses would feel better if your body was more limber when you started. This has been a problem for me because I noticed that my knees have hurt a bit after a week of practicing w/ this DVD.  For instance, performing sun salutation and other poses when you are bending, and bringing your knees forward from crouching poses. This isn't a problem when I attend my live class or with using other DVDs where they feature a proper warm up.

Also, the instructor doesn't use good transitions from asana to asana. After you hold a pose for a few breaths, the screen goes black, and the Sanskrit name of the asana appears, and then the instructor appears again. She may be sitting or standing then moves into the pose. I have found that videos and live classes are easier and more enjoyable if the routine is organized such that you flow from one pose to ""Structurally"" for the body using transitions enables you physically to move into each pose easier. (I realize that for some asanas you can't do that, such as shoulder stands and headstands.)",1289692800,9,2225,4.72609819121447

1788565,4,B00006RCNF,"I have been taking a yoga class regularly for almost a year now, and I think this video is great for home practice. I think if you are familiar with yoga ""basics,"" you can really learn a lot from Yoga for Every Body.

What I like:
Variety. Between the different skill levels and the number of practices, there's always a fitting series.

Time. The practices range from 20 minutes (and actually last just that long, which is important when you are fitting yoga into a tight schedule) to over 45 minutes.

Quality instruction. Gormley is good at pointing out where you should feel a pose, how to come in and out of poses, how to modify poses for your ability level, and when to back off.

What I don't like:
My real-life yoga instructor emphasizes the importance of doing each pose on both sides of the body. So if you are doing, say, a seated forward bend with your legs crossed, you would change the cross of your legs and do the pose again. Gormley does not always do this. I just pause the DVD and do the second side.

What you should know before you begin with this video:
Get your props ready! It is helpful (though not necessary) to have a folded blanket, a strap, and one or two blocks ready at all times. I don't use props often, but since starting with this DVD, I've experimented with them and think they can be very beneficial.

Have your remote handy, too. Sometimes I like to pause and repeat a pose on another side. Also, and I don't know if this is just my system or an issue with the DVD, this video is LOUD. Unless I want to wake up the neighborhood, I turn the volume WAY down before starting this DVD.

Overall, I think this is a great value and a useful guide for yoga home practice.",1277251200,6,1702,4.3

I am still working on the beginning routines, but am looking forward to graduating to medium levels soon.  Although I felt better after the first week, this is not a ""quick fix"".

I never saw Ms. Gormley smile which imparts that this Yoga exercise should be treated respectfully.  (note: she might have a hint of a smile in some of her more difficult routines).  I just needed something to do that would motivate me and it has.  I eat better.  I am more disciplined because you have to wait 3 hours after eating to exercise.

I swear I picked the 45+ minute routine, but it seems like I got 3 or 4 poses then go to savasana. I looked at the clock and it was barely 20 minutes.  I picked another 45+ minutes routine, same thing, just a few poses and then another savasana. After did 2 routines, I gave up. I felt like I had not accomplished anything and felt so Un-satisfying; I've been so sad all day.  I like to do a full routine Vinyasa style and this video probably won't do it for me.

1788636,5,B00006RCNF,"I purchased this DVD over a year ago because I was intrigued with all that it had to offer: 1) Close to 48 routines that are broken down into Beginner Series, Intermediate Series, and Advanced Series. 2) Various times for each practice, anywhere from 20-30 minutes for beginners, 20-45 minutes for intermediates, and 30-70 minutes for advanced learners. 3) Mix of practices that are focused on certain parts of the body such as, back, hips, arms, etc. 4) Step-by-step instructions on proper body alignment and breathing.

JJ Gormley, the instructor, thoroughly explains the poses in a very clear, soft-spoken, and encouraging manner. She always advises to push yourself as far as your body will let you. In addition, she offers moderations for different poses using props such as, blocks, straps, and blankets if one needs them. A nice touch is announcing the pose before each segment and then displaying it in English, along with its Sanskrit equivalent, on your screen to help you remember.

For those who complain about the abrupt black screen between each pose, I suggest holding the previous pose a little longer, or do a transition pose like downward facing dog or child's pose. Trust me, there are a few minor flaws in the video, but overall, it is an excellent purchase you won't regret if you're serious about yoga.

I own several other yoga dvds and I still use this one quite a bit to keep in touch with the basics. It is truly an awesome foundation for learning yoga and what it can do for you. I do a lot of the beginner and some intermediate segments in the morning, and do the advances series at night when I get home from work. Absolutely one of the best DVDs I've ever bought for myself.

I found the ""flow"" to be lacking, and since I am a beginner, I need a little more time to get into poses and these routines have you jumping from pose to pose that do not have a cohesive flow from one to another.  I also did not care for the ""bare-bones"" studio setting.  No music or scenery here.  If you want relaxation it's gotta come from within I guess, because this DVD isn't giving it to you.

 Found that the ""beginner"" lessons were too easy, and Intermediate to be too hard.  Very complicated with using blocks, blankets and such, even in the beginner levels, with no explanation as to when to use them or how to do the poses without a folded blanket or two.  Also, this DVD doesn't use the common names for poses but a foreign language instead.
I prefered the other DVD I bought- Yoga for Beginners by Rodney Yee (Gaiam) Which had a helpful tutorial with common mistakes in posture, etc.  This DVD did not explain at all what you were supposed to be getting out of each move.",1241827200,21,1081,4.338308457711443

Second, the pauses between the poses may be confusing at first, but once you get the hang of each routine, it's not a problem.  I love the 3 different levels: beginning, intermediate and advanced and the two  sub-levels of times (i.e., under 35 minutes or 35+ minutes).  I do the video twice daily and mix up the different levels/times to suit my schedule.  I have found that my lower back, which was chronically in some kind of pain, no longer hurts...at all!!!

Compared to ""Yoga For Beginners"" with Barbara Benagh, this DVD is not as good.  I do like that there are a variety of subtitles to choose from and that they are categorized into different levels of expertise (beginner - advanced).  I think that it could have been better in transitioning between poses.  Sometimes you are in a pose and then the next thing you know it has faded out and you're in a new pose.  It also could have been better in terms of expressing breathing patterns, which is very important in yoga.  It does mention breathing at certain moments, but it is does not really relate breathing to the poses, the way I needed it to as a beginner.",1234483200,5,763,4.375886524822695

The exercises didn't really seem to flow smoothly. I didn't like the apparent structure of the different levels. It appears that each exercise was individually taped, then, depending on the level of exercise,the pre-taped exercises were shuffled around and inserted. Basically they were all the same exercises only pared and chopped and repositioned.
It appeared to me that the 'close-ups' of some moves could have been videotaped in a way that didn't feature the demonstrators crotch. I found some of those shots to be very unpleasing to view.

I wouldn't have bought this DVD had I been able to preview it. It really wasn't what I was looking for. I still prefer the Rodney Yee Yoga series the best. They are shot in nicer venues with pretty scenery. The music is much more conducive to the exercise of yoga for me.

I could not walk a week ago.  I've been taking high doses of ibuprofen, and resting in bed.  I was in absolute pain.

I took this out last night as I have a lot of back yoga dvds, and this one, for some reason stood out for me.

I put on the INTERMEDIATE - SPINE part, and that is about a 50 minute session.  And I am starting to feel better.  I did it last night and today.

Now, having said that, I'm not enamored of all the poses on this dvd, but if you have sciatica, please get this and do INTERMEDIATE - SPINE and you will start to get some help from this dvd.

And, though I haven't read all the reviews on this dvd, I know that in the past they mention what the instructor looks like.  She has one of those faces, like Tilda Swinton, that is absolutely stunning in makeup, and looks a little drab without it, but please, don't let you put that off.  She is an excellent instructor, and is calm.

Oh and for some of the ""props"", I did it DIY.  In other words, I used a towel for the ""strap"" prop, and a stuffed couch pillow to sit on for the ""blankets"" prop.

I've bought a few videos, but what I liked most about this one was how slow the practice tended to be which as first may seem kind of odd, but I liked it because I didn't feel rushed or that I was in competition with anyone else which you sometimes feel part of a large class.  I am able to learn more about each poses and their benefits as well as proper alignment.  For those looking to learn more about Yoga in-depth Id say it's a great buy and learning tool.",1106179200,10,682,4.074626865671642

I've been practicing yoga for little over a year, but depending entirely on getting to studio, which is almost 45 minutes from home.

Lots of variety, too much to mention here, but check it out hopefully you'll like it as much as I did.  My yoga teacher had said that you need something good to supplement your workouts when you cant make it to class.  While Ive heard some folks say you should get 90 minutes of practice in for someone with my schedule who hasn't practiced you for that look it can become a major pain in the butt.  Anyway, the instructor is clear and concise the the flow steady and slow, Ive had a few other yoga videos that were just way too damn fast.",1099008000,6,682,4.183206106870229

The title offers lots of variety and is sure to please just about anybody from beginners to the more advance.  The instructor is easy to follow along to, although there is no substitution for getting to a stuido for teacher instruction. The more advance will love the more challenging exercises.

I've been hearing a lot about yoga over the last few years and wanted to try it.  I picked this video up after reading a few reviews, one which I think was in Yoga Journal.  The amount of workouts were really amazing, even my daugher commented on how she has never see a video with so many different workouts. I'm a grandmother so I wanted something that was easy for me to follow and not get discouraged and boy was I not disappointed.  The instructors are easy to follow along with and give pointers on the poses.  I'd say this is a keeper.",1098835200,5,675,4.291338582677166

1788742,5,B00006RCNF,"i spend most of the year living in remote places, so i have fallen out of the habit of doing yoga. i bought this dvd when i got a new laptop computer with an internal dvd player. it is just great.

used to be i would go to yoga classes off and on, so i have some knowledge of the poses, but am by no means advanced. and i'm the proud owner of what appear to be the tightest, most stubborn hamstrings in the history of bipeds. this dvd was neither too challenging nor too easy. it is helping me improve in flexibility and strength. it is relaxing and ideal as a daily practice dvd, because of the variety and the calm soothing manner of the instructor.

there are over thirty different workouts, taught in iyengar style, broken down first into level of practice (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) and then within each of those they are again divided into practices either shorter or longer than 45 minutes. within each of those sections, there are various routines arranged to target a particular part of the body or as a general practice routine. the great thing about the dvd is that each pose is a single chapter, prefaced by the sanskrit name of the pose spoken and written on the screen (only 1-2 seconds). each routine is a string of chapters that takes you through a set group of poses. you can forward to other chapters within a routine if you want to skip certain poses or want to shorten the routine length. you can also go to a particular pose if you want to work on it individually, as long as you note the chapter number. there is no set way to do this (which would have been a nice touch).

the one thing some folks might not like is that the routines therefore do not always flow from one pose into another like a live class. sometimes you finish sitting in one pose and have to be in on your hands and knees for the next, for example. i found this insignificant, especially given the versatility this format allows, but it may be irksome to others. another plus on this dvd is that some poses that are hard to learn are taught differently at each of the practice levels--for example, there are beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of the sun salutation. actually, i wish they had done this with more of the poses, but whether they do or don't, the instructor always includes suggestions for modifications and use of props. there are also a handful of different versions of savasana (corpse or relaxation pose) so you don't have to hear the same spiel every time. the dvd does not include poses that can cause injury if not taught by an instructor, such as handstand and plow. there is a supported shoulderstand but no full shoulderstand and there are several routines that include headstand.

the instructor has a smooth gentle voice and explains things very well. i like the no-frills atmosphere of the dvd--simple music, simple set design, one nice lady (the instructor) doing the poses. i'd rather get more routines for the money than views of distant beaches, however beautiful.

i have since bought the pilates and power yoga dvds in this series. the pilates is not bad, very extensive in choices with detailed and easy to follow instruction, but i find the instructor's voice a bit irritating. the power yoga dvd took some getting used to for me, as it is a sloooooowwwwww flow version of power yoga, not what you would expect from the title. since learning to change gears before using it, it has grown on me. still, i use this dvd far more often and expect to continue to do so.",1092700800,20,3514,4.52755905511811
1788743,5,B00006RCNF,"The fact that you can pick your level and your routine is fantastic - it's so nice to have so many workouts in one DVD.  I've done it many times, and haven't gotten bored yet.  I highly recommend it, though personally I feel that beginners should take a few classes before starting an at-home practice.",1088553600,,302,4.472727272727273
1788744,5,B00006RCNF,"I have a few Yoga VCR tapes. This is my first DVD. I am pleased that it makes good use of options DVD provides - the ability to provide menus and skip forwards and backward easily.
There are several workouts for beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels. Within each of these categories, there are further selections for long and short workouts that are either general practices or have specific goals (body areas, aches & pains, etc).
I have not done an advanced workout yet. I was pleased that in an intermediate workout there were 2 poses I have not seen before on a tape or in a class. The poses were clearly explained and it was easy to follow the tape. The instructor, JJ, often shows or tells you about  different ways you can modify poses to suit your body's ability (or inability!).
I have a 2 year old. I absolutely love that there are so many workouts to choose from that I can always find one to fit in the free time I have while she naps, or early in the morning, or while she's playing with Dad. No more saying, 'Well, guess I have to do it tomorrow' just becuase I don't have an hour free to complete one of my tapes. Sure, I know, I could just make my own workout up, but it just doesn't happen.
Some reviews complain about the black screen between poses - that it is disruptive and not conducive to flow. I don't have a problem with it. The first time you do a workout you will notice it. The second time through, you begin to see ways to connnect the poses on your own - for example - pose one might end in downward facing dog pose, and pose 2 begins with it - so you just hold it an extra second. In general, holding the end of a pose until the next one begins seems to work OK.
It seems that on the shortest workouts this doesn't always hold true - they don't always flow well. BUT - you have plenty of time to recover and get into position. If flow is what you are after, then you will be disgruntled, but otherwise there isn't a problem.
I suggest watching the brief segment on technique review. She clearly explains the different body parts and alignment cues she mentions.  I found it very helpful.
The teacher's style is very relaxed and straightforward. I do not like overly flowery and spiritual delivery - I always feel like that should be up to the student. I found JJ's style to be perfect for me.
In all - this is a great DVD and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good variety of quality workouts. The instruction is clear enough for beginners, the workouts challenging enough for at least intermediate students. I'm not advanced, so I can't speak for them!",1079827200,366,2596,4.328542094455853

I did feel a little sore after doing my first workout, but thats because I am the most un-flexible person every.  Despite being a little sore, I felt energized after each workout. A half-hour a day really helps a lot!
I would recomend this video to anyone who wants to try out yoga, or any one of any skill level, because you can keep challenging yourself to do the harder poses and workouts.",1076371200,7,645,4.543103448275862

There is little chance I will outgrow or get bored with this DVD. There are so many workouts to choose from, and they are interesting and challenging.
The instruction given by JJ Gormley is very clear and good. Some of the workouts are geared towards a specific area of the body (e.g. ""oh my aching neck!"") or goal (""preparing for meditation""), which is helpful.
All in all, I love this DVD and highly recommend it.",1074297600,7,708,4.626984126984127

However, as one reviewer pointed out, these workouts are merely choppy video segments strung together.  It would be nice if there was a flow with warm up and cool down, at least for the longer workouts.
