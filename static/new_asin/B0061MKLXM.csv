I loved the singing duet between the two main characters.  The speed of events went along at the right pace and all of the actors delivered solid performances.

It is one of my favorite movies which I can watch over and over;there is always a new element to discover!",1513641600,,439,4.878378378378378
8490877,3,B0061MKLXM,"I almost gave up on this movie.  It is not a typical Bollywood movie.  There 's a twist - and that 's fine.  It's just that it took forever to get to the point. A young woman lives in a small town.  She runs a watch repair shop. One day,  a young man shows up to get his wet watch repaired.  There is obviously something wrong with him mentally.  Uh oh.  That's when the story slows down as you wait for the mystery of who he really is to be revealed.  The acting was good,  for the most part. The songs were forgettable.  It was an ok movie.",1353801600,,542,3.925925925925926
