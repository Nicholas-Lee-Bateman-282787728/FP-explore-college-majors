8086701,4,B000BH4V84,"This DVD has two full length horror films on one side. The quality is not the best, but it is definitely watchable with no major audio or video problems. There is no scene access on the dvd.

Eaten Alive is a fun and twisted low-budget horror that fans of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre will enjoy. Three of the original cast and crew take part in this movie, and as you watch, you will often be reminded of TCM. The soundtrack to this film is very similar to TCM, but still original.

There is a fair amount of unnecessary dialogue and adding crocidiles to this storyline seems a bit gimmicky, besides, they look really fake. Expect a small amount of really well done gore effects.

Overall Eaten Alive is a better than average horror flick that verges on being really creepy! 3 1/2 STARS",1142208000,4,795,4.506944444444445
