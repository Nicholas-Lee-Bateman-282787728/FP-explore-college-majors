8233573,1,B000YOIOEQ,"SUPERB ""made for TV"" movie - this and the original ""The FBI Murders"" were the two best ""In the Line of Duty"" series!! However, the BIG problem with this particular DVD's production (Just the ""HUNT FOR JUSTICE"" DVD) is that while the film itself is in English, there are foreign ""subtitles"" that flash across the bottom of the screen during the film's playing. I tried playing this DVD disc on a region-free player, as well as having a local video company convert it to a ""region 1"" disc, and in BOTH cases, it still does the same damned thing:..!! The foreign subtitles flash across the bottom of the screen during the playing of the movie & there's NOTHING you can do to get rid of them!! In my opinion, this sort of thing essentially constitutes a ""lie of omission"" within the original listing of the product - essentially a ""lie"" in order to get people to buy the disc. Had I known that these subtitles were a permanent part of the film, I never would've ordered it to begin with!! Oh well, live and learn, I guess! I recommend that people not buy from this seller, as a result of his response to my inquiry. If he doesn't care enough to straighten this situation out, then why should we care to order from him...? Food for thought...!!",1490400000,,1239,4.462555066079295
