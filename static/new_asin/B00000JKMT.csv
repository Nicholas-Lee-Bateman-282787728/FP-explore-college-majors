7912422,1,B00000JKMT,This is not wcw mayhem 99. this video sucks. Half the matches are cut and paste. WCW Mayhem 99 was a pay per view not a compilation of matches.,1246579200,,143,3.9655172413793105
7912423,4,B00000JKMT,"wcw did a great pay per view back in 99,i watched it on my neighbours dish.every match was good.",1224115200,2,96,4.105263157894737
7912424,3,B00000JKMT,"What bothers me about this tape is that they make hulk hogan or hollywood hogan the face of wcw. Well he's not, guys like Ric Flair, Sting, Lex Luger made wcw great to watch for a while. Look im a hulk hogan fan but im always going to remember him for what he did in the wwe. But if you like to see hogan career in wcw i'd buy this tape it does have some great matches with Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Sting, and Goldberg. So if you like hulk hogan in wcw buy it i hope you like it.",1187827200,,479,3.8
7912425,2,B00000JKMT,"I will keep this straight forward and to the point. The only positive aspect of this video is it does have old footage of WCW Nitro. You can not really see this stuff anymore unless you recorded it yourself back in the day. However, this whole video is about Hogan. Hulkster or Hollywood, every match has Hogan, so really this is not the best of Nitro, since Hogan slowed matches down anyway. Hogan is the man, but not right in this Nitro collection. The tape covers Hogan from 94 to early 99. If you like the Hulk then get this, but again, not even close to being a best of Nitro video. None of the matches shown were very well done, even if it was a championship match. I wish it was better, but it is not a good example of the great matches from Nitro. **",1121212800,,758,4.163265306122449
7912426,1,B00000JKMT,By far the worst WCW video ever made.  There was not point in publishing this video.  Many of the matches weren't even shown it entirely.  The only good part about this video was that i was only 1 hour long.,1108080000,3,207,4.125
7912427,5,B00000JKMT,"The history of Hulk Hogan's conversion from hero to bad boy, Sting and his daredevil entrances, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage's unpredictable madness and Goldberg's rise to Heavyweight Champion.",1042675200,2,189,5.785714285714286
7912428,5,B00000JKMT,"This is the best WCW tape ever. The best is the nWo stuff. The Hogan - 4 Horseman feud is extremely boring. The best match is Nash, Hall, and Hollwood Hogan vs. Giant, the champ Sting and the Macho Man Randy Savage. Also Hollwood vs. Luger match is good too.",980553600,2,258,4.18
