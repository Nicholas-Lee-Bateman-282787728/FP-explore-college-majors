6618852,5,B00N9QM6N6,I have seen this movie on Hallmark a couple of times now. It is a cute Christmas love story. I have had it pre-ordered for 3 weeks now. With the Christmas season now upon us let's hope it arrives soon,1417132800,,200,4.025

6618856,5,B00N9QM6N6,"I love this movie...It was originally called ""Fir Crazy""!!",1414972800,10,58,5.555555555555555
6618857,4,B00N9QM6N6,"I miss Chuck like crazy. And, so, whenever I see any of that awesome cast surface in a show or a movie, I beam like a headlight. Sarah Lancaster was so appealing as ""Ellie Bartowski."" I can't possibly bag on Fir Crazy or Oh Christmas Tree! or whatever it is they're titling this 2013 Hallmark holiday picture. Yes, it's a flawed movie, I think mostly because there's not much to the core premise and so the script threw in a lot of filler scenes.

Uptown girl Elise MacReynolds (Lancaster) is going places. Feet shod in $300 shoes, reveling in her newly bought loft apartment, a good get in bustling New York City. Elise hasn't been back at her childhood home in a year, what with work, work, work. A marketing executive for an athletic shoe company, she's been putting in the hours, fingers crossed for that huge promotion. Elise prefers her coffee plain - her barista once remarked of her: ""No whip cream, no nutmeg, no fun.""

Blame the crap economy, blame her shallow, appearance-is-everything boyfriend. It's the same crap day that finds Elise downsized and dumped, within shouting distance of the holidays. You almost can't blame her for trying to share the misery:

- Elise (still reeling from just being laid off): ""But why me? Why not Brandy? She's late every day!""
- Her ex-boss: ""Oh, she's getting fired, too. She's... just not here yet.""

What's a girl to do? Elise MacReynolds ends up going back to her childhood home at the farm, but come to find that her dad had broken his leg, leaving him unable to tend to the annual family business of selling Christmas trees on their family tree lot in Manhattan. This year, from Thanksgiving to Christmas, it's up to Elise and her cousin to manage the tree lot, an onerous task that had so bedeviled her childhood days.

The story conflict revolves around the Scroogy owner (Colin Mochrie) of the department store that abuts the MacReynolds tree lot, this jerk who thinks that it's low class and bad for business to have folks selling Xmas trees right outside his store. Elise hasn't been down with the holidays for a long while now. The store owner's attempts to force her out of business aren't at all rekindling her Christmas spirit. Not to mention, she's hunkered down, freezing her you-know-what off in that iceberg of a family trailer parked by the lot.

Why exactly is it bad for business to have people selling Christmas trees right outside your store - a store that, mind you, sells Christmas ormanents? It's best not to ask. But it's shaky motivation on the owner's part.

Sarah Lancaster is the end all, be all of Fir Crazy. If she weren't onscreen, I don't know that I'd at all like the movie. She's effortless and very winning in this romantic comedy. I also liked her in Along Came A Nanny and in Love Finds You in Sugarcreek (both, 2014). She's got that blend of wistfulness and look-you-in-the-eye directness, and she keeps things from getting too treacly. She and potential love interest - Eric Johnson's public schoolteacher in Queens (and Elise's repeat customer) - muster up a nice chemistry. But it's her thorny scenes with nasty store owner Gary (Mochrie) that I really enjoyed. First, it's neat to see brilliant improv comic Colin Mochrie step out of Whose Line Is It? and try on a different hat. And he's actually such a convincing Scrooge type that I don't know that I buy into his abrupt turn-around. If there's one glaring flaw to the film, it's that there isn't really much to the plot. I get the sense that the writers had to come up with filler scenes to wrap around the key moving parts and make it all add up to 90 minutes. I can't complain too much, though. Even these thumb-twiddling scenes still featured Sarah Lancaster. I am more than okay with that. She definitely needs to do more of these.",1414022400,29,3782,4.6442451420029895
6618858,4,B00N9QM6N6,"Fir Crazy was title on TV, not sure why the change. Nearly 5 star but as much as I liked it, I would not put it among the greatest Christmas movies of all time. Great movie and very entertaining. Sarah Lancaster making her first holiday film and it was a success. Loved her as Eleanor Bartowski, so was excited to see this with her in 2012, but then it got moved to 2013 release on TV.  After growing on a Christmas tree farm she grows tired of all things Christmas, but due to a job loss she if forced back to the family business where she rediscovers Christmas.  Funny, charming and you see how things can work out in the end even if they do not make sense.",1410480000,48,659,4.140625
6618859,1,B00N9QM6N6,"I thought this was going to be an entertaining Christmas movie, starring Sarah Lancaster and Eric Johnson. This movie was so amateurish in not only the sound quality, but the acting. I have seen both of these actors in other movies and was very happy with their performances. I was very disappointed in having spent the money to purchase the dvd, and could not make it past the first fifteen minutes of it.",1513987200,,406,4.575342465753424
6618860,5,B00N9QM6N6,Great family movie!,1513814400,,19,5.666666666666667
6618861,5,B00N9QM6N6,Really good movie.  Not my favorite but a really good movie.,1513641600,,60,4.454545454545454
6618862,3,B00N9QM6N6,"Not the most exciting movie in the world, also things happened in the plot that you expect with these low budget holiday themed TV movies since they are always so predictable, and writers never dare to try anything else, but the reasons were weak as well as they were sudden for characters to change from one school of thought to another.  Basically a woman with a high opinion of herself marketing ability wise, is surprised when the boss of the running shoe company asks to speak to her and he fires her instead.  Her boyfriend who also works for the company also dumps her so she's forced to take up her mother's offer to work on their family farm's New York City corner tree sales yard, since she took out a massive mortgage because she liked the view of her apartment.  She hasn't bothered to do much more than visit her parents at the tree lot for a few minutes when they've come to town over the last couple of decades.  She hated working there as a child.  She turns up late for the first day on the job, and had somehow forgotten all the physical labour involved with the job.  She's not dressed for it as she wants to be ready at a moments notice to go to a job interview if her work agent finds her one. Why she doesn't just put the interview clothes in the caravan on site, and get changed if it rings, I don't know. To make matters worse she makes a terrible impression on the new owners of the store, her family leases the area from (Colin Mochrie - Who's Line is it Anyway?).  Now the store owner wants nothing more than to get rid of her and the trees.

It's watchable but nothing great.  I thought with Mochrie in it, there may be some really fun lines from his character, but there wasn't, his character doesn't have any comedic lines.  I also wondered the whole movie why the mother never came to New York to sell trees, since she owns the business after all and they pretty much faced financial ruin if they didn't sell enough trees to cover their costs.  Even the father with a broken leg could have sat at a table processing payments or something like that. Answered questions on the trees, dealt with the store owner and things like that.",1513641600,,2161,4.350746268656716

6618866,5,B00N9QM6N6,"This is one of my favorites but it's not called ""Oh Christmas Tree!"" lol... it's called Fir Crazy. Even Hallmark calls it Fir Crazy. Why is this DVD so horribly mislabeled?",1510012800,,172,4.580645161290323

6618868,4,B00N9QM6N6,"This film is far from perfect but saying ""It's Okay"" is an insult as well.  This is a strictly formula HALLMARK movie (When they air the film its called Fir Crazy) but it works and it entertains.  In this film a ""Career Woman"" not only loses her job but her boyfriend on the same day.  One thing leads into another and she ends up running her family's Christmas Tree lot.  What works in this film ""Works Well""!  What doesn't work is that once you see the first 20 minutes you know how it is going to air.  The film pulls itself up from the bottom of the barrel because it cast well .  This may not have ""people"" you recognize but it had characters most of us can relate too.",1503446400,,674,4.138461538461539

6618873,3,B00N9QM6N6,"For me, this movie remained a superficial story.  I found Sarah Lancaster's acting too rigid in a sense.  She delivered her lines but not believably.  The cast wasn't well picked.  And, in the beginning, I didn't like all the negativity.  Sarah didn't want to go home and her dad was cranky all the time.  And, there were problems with the location chosen to sell Christmas trees.  It just didn't have the warm feeling to it.  It's a nice movie but I won't probably watch it much hereafter.",1493251200,,490,4.551724137931035

6618972,4,B00N9QM6N6,"Well first off it took me 3 years to see this movie in its entirety. I saw the first part the year it came out. The next year I saw a little of the middle part. Then last year I saw the first part. A little of the latter middle part. Then the very end. Why? Because the movie is not entitled ""Oh Christmas Tree!"" on TV. I don't have cable/satellite. When I went to families for Christmas/Thanksgiving it was on but with holiday distractions during the visit I didn't get to see the entire part. I did look online for the VOD or DVD but could not find it. No wonder. It had a different name. It was ""Fir Crazy"" on TV. That is what I knew it to me. I had to search online for the title as I never saw the title when I saw the bits and pieces.

Anyway, another cute fairy tale ginger bread type movie. Career NYC girl gets fired during Christmas. Dad breaks foot. So she has to help the family out by attending the family farm tree lot in the city. Her bf breaks up with her. Some new guy is interested in her. The neighboring newly owned dept store hates the tree lot. Etc. In the end all works out . . . on every front. They even threw in a non-confrontational Jew is the mix. Without the resentment she even had a good time at Christmas.

Cute, non-insulting, non-offending movie. It actually shows an American I grew up with as far as the people and the city scenes go. Maybe that is why I like it as well. While the guy has an annoying accent he is pleasing to look at. The girl is kinda annoying in the beginning with her arrogant ""Im above this attitude"". But she is classy underneath and gets her head on straight when she realizes that no corporation is your friend in employment.

I like positive movies with positive endings. Who needs more aggravation in this life? Not me",1424736000,7,1781,4.171511627906977

6618989,3,B00N9QM6N6,We love Christmas chick flicks but this one was just OK. I guess we were disappointed because based on the  description we were expecting the typical she leaves her job in the city to go home to the Christmas tree farm and save the family business but she actually stays in the city and works on the tree lot selling trees which is fine and not as typical but just not what we were expecting. We will keep it but probably not one we will watch over and over again.,1422230400,,464,4.155555555555556

6619004,3,B00N9QM6N6,"I liked the original title better (Fir Crazy) because the main character (Sarah Lancaster) is certainly that.
Sarah Lancaster plays Elise, a workaholic grump, resentful of the family business (Christmas trees).  Expecting a great promotion, she is summarily fired instead.  To add insult to injury, her boyfriend dumps her.  What else could possibly go wrong?  No surprise, she has to work in her parent's Christmas tree lot settled right in front of a store belonging to an evil lout who plots through most of the movie to get rid of her and her trees.
There are very few revelations to be had in this hackneyed plot.  Elise eventually thaws where Christmas is concerned.  She catches the eye of an aimless passerby (Eric Johnson).  And the EVIL store owner finally sees the light and has an instant change of heart.  None of it feels real or natural.  At all times, it feels like a half-baked soap opera plot stuck on simmer.
Still, it's pleasant enough if you like lukewarm romances for Christmas.
I'm keeping it to watch again next Christmas.",1419552000,,1046,4.798882681564246
6619005,5,B00N9QM6N6,This movie Oh Christmas Tree is about a young woman named Elise (Sarah Lascaster)  who has her dream job as a corporate in marketing and is hoping for promotion.  But Elise gets a surprise instead she gets fired from her job.  Elise's parents own a Christmas Tree lot that they need help with because her father broke his foot. At first Elise is not happy to having to work at her parents tree farm but grows to love it. She had worked at the farm every Christmas since she was little. One day Elise meets a man named Darren (Eric Johnson). Darren is a  grade school teacher. He is always is at the tree lot trying to talk to Elise. He finally gets to talk to her and they hit it off  well.  The company that Elise use to work for wants the tree lot to go out of business because they share a sidewalk.  Watch this movie to see what happens to the tree lot. Oh Christmas Tree is a great holiday movie.  Last year when the movie was on Hallmark it was called Fir Crazy.,1419206400,2,968,4.13903743315508
