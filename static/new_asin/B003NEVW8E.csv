4157306,4,B003NEVW8E,"The film Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament Of George Harrison is a very impressive piece of fiction.  Born out of the spirit of films like the Blair Witch Project and The Fourth Kind, the DVD tells the viewer at the beginning of the film that this is some true story (and is backed up by actual either video testimony as was done in the Fouth Kind, or in this case by a mysterious micro cassette tape anonymously mailed to an entertainment company nobody ever heard of, and had no apparent ties to any of the Beatles).  The film has one or two discrepancies that any true Beatles fan would recognize as inaccurate facts, but the ONLY thing that drew my attention (and I watched this part several times) was the interview on Aussie TV near the end of the DVD with George Harrison where he ACTUALLY calls McCartney Faul instead of Paul.  I watched his lips and compared it to several other words that he used which had the letter P and I believe he definitely said Faul.  However, in one spot the voice claims Lennon was shot a week after he spoke to Harrison threatening to leak the truth, but at the end the voice claims he was killed two weeks after John allegedly called.  The other discrepancies are that the voice claims John told him it had been 20 years since Pauls death when in fact it had been only fourteen if the facts bore out.  The last MAJOR discrepancy is that the voice claims that Let It Be was written and recorded after the album actually was.  Let It Be was in the can and ready to go long before the film claims it was recorded.

All in all though, the DVD was very well done in the respect that it credibly explains all of the alleged back masking, album cover clues, and tragic publicized incidents and weaves them into one cohesive story.  Its almost down right believable if you know nothing about the Beatles.  To that end, it is another example of how the conspiracy buffs came up with the rumor that Paul was actually dead and a double put in his place, and justified it with a cleverly written story.  I found it a very entertaining piece of fiction but this is the only way you should view this.  If you are looking to confirm the conspiracy? then this film will excite you.  If you just want to be entertained by a good story that has some basis in fact (the fact that some people say Paul is dead) and you want to see just how some people have came to that conclusion interwoven by a narrative in the first person then I recommend this film.  It is what it is and I wouldn't recommend anyone take the film too seriously except to just enjoy the effort.",1283385600,2,2600,4.334020618556701
4157307,5,B003NEVW8E,"OK, ""I'm A  Believer"" may be the title to a 1967 Monkees smash hit and an old 45 of mine, but after viewing this film a few weeks back, I'm happy to say I'M A BELIEVER in 'Faul""!!  Joel Gilbert creates a masterful piece full of clue after clues, and then some new clues I've never realized until watching this. It was fun to watch this mystery unfold. I'll view it again, and again and highly recommend to anyone who loves music. Enjoy everyone!

4157308,4,B003NEVW8E,"I'm convinced this was done as a joke, but if not, it's even funnier. Isn't it a pity someone spoiled the Rita factor? By the time you get to that, had you not known, you'd have roared. I think what I like most about this is that you could see the 4 of them going along with it. It's a little late in the game at this point, since anyone who'd been around at the time of the controversy knows the story. Had it come out then, it would have added such an absurd fuel to an already silly premise that Western Culture might never have recovered.
My wife thinks Paul wouldn't have been so mean as to go along with some of this, but who knows.
Regardless, if you like the idea of sending pop icons up for a titter and giggle, this is hard to beat and it's not expensive and it's a better comedy than I've seen in a long while. If you still believe pop idols are to be worshipped, than steer clear, and don't send your kids over to sleep with them in their compounds. Just take my word for it.

I'm mean REALLY what are the chances that they could not only find someone that looks just like the original Paul McCartney (in an astonishingly short amount of time) but is also an even MORE brilliant songwriter? The odds would have to be absolutely astronomical!

4157311,1,B003NEVW8E,"This is horrible.  They could have made an interesting Paul Is Dead film with all the old clues, but they didn't even get the simpliest facts straight.  They say Paul dies in 1966.  They then say the Beatles put clues in their songs. Some awful samples: The say they recorded the album ""Yesterday and Today""  (which was never an album they recorded, but left over tracks) after he died. On that album they claim that John wrote Yesterday for Paul.  ""Yesterday"" was released in 1965 on the Help LP.  They even played it in concert in 1966, before the date they claim that Paul died.  The Rubber Soul album was recorded before the 1966 date that they say Paul died, but they cite clues in the songs and on the cover.  The have the fake George Harrison voice say that John and Paul wrote ""Only a Northern Song"".  George himself wrote it and sang it. They claim that Heather Mills was the girl in the car with Paul when he died (marrying him after Linda died on a bribe to reveal the truth) That was 1966. She was born in 1968. if she was an adult in 1966, she would be almost Paul's age now. Not even close. There are many more instances of simple facts they could have gotten right, and it would have been an interesting piece of fiction, instead of a horrible joke.  Really shoddy fact checking on a band whose facts are easy to find.",1280361600,234,1333,4.317269076305221
4157312,5,B003NEVW8E,"You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to really enjoy this film. It celebrates the Beatles razor sharp wit and playful relationship with both the media and fans.  So packed with information you'll have to watch it again and again, it leaves you with plenty to think about. The sheer number of clues is staggering and will leave a even the biggest cynic a little unsure about what to believe. Filled with tons of great Beatles footage a must see for any Beatles fan. The legend of the Beatles continues to grow thanks to this great film.

4157313,5,B003NEVW8E,"Could this be a hoax heaped upon another hoax? Or is that the voice of George Harrison calmly relating the cover up in precise chronological detail?  My opinion doesn't matter.  What matters is that this film has the ability to stop you in your tracks and make you reconsider your previous beliefs about the whole ""Paul is Dead"" mystery.

""Paul McCartney Really Is Dead"" is extremely well-paced and well-produced, and is best described as a ""dark comedy thriller"" as it takes the ""Paul is Dead"" mystery to an entirely new level.  Highly recommended for all Beatles fans, music history fans, and conspiracy theorists!

4157314,4,B003NEVW8E,"This has got to be the end-all report on the rumored demise of the much-loved Beatle.
The production value of the video is a ten, altho the actual premise of the production, is a tad questionable.
It was 40 years ago,  the wild-fire like spread of the tragedy, jolted all Beatle fans.
This DVD has more of the ""clues"" explained, then any other study ever attempted.

Leaving rumors/facts aside, the best part of the disc is the extra, which is an interview with the famed rock journalist, Al Aronowitz.
He was actually there, when Bob Dylan visited The Beatles in their hotel room.
And what took place is a matter of such magnitude, such importance, such historical weight, it's amazing that finally, Mr. Aronowitz admits the much believed rumor is actually an absolute fact.  And the picture he describes is way beyond any rumor.",1278028800,5,830,4.75

And why would the Beatles from 1966-1970 continue all the clues,the hints, the backward masking through out all those lps give us, the fans, listeners?, all this evidence of the real truth that the real Paul from 1958- 1966 did indeed in fact die in that car crash?...I believe it was their way of mourning, no doubt!...Lennon was murdered in 1980, Harrison died following in 2001, or cancer?...only his wife and son would know this truth?, perhaps they fear their death as well?, Ringo in a recent interview openly admits that the real Paul McCartney did actually die in 1966 in that horrible fatal car crash...Faul's  ex- wife Heather Mills is willing to announce this deceptive truth in her own way about Faul-Paul not being the real  person he claims to be all these years?....Check her interview out on utube?...I believe her!...My favorite Beatles music till this day has always been the albums from 1966- to their last lp's Abbey Road and Let it Be, then their break-up,1970....Yes, I was a child then, Im a musician and their music lives!!!!!!!!!....Rock On!!...Long Live!..Lennon, the real Paul,& Faul,Harrison,and Ringo!!!!!!",1506470400,5,1597,5.083969465648855

But what is perhaps even more amazing is that these people feel compelled to trumpet their detective work in these reviews.

I was a kid when the Beatles released their albums.  One thing this documentary does is reveal how much I miss album artwork.  This is a compelling 90 minute documentary compiled largely from album covers and dust jackets.  Bravo - a must view for Beatle fans.

Certainly interesting and entertaining, but please don't take it seriously.

Few facts are wrong which kills the whole premise tho.

Most Glaring?  It claims Heather Mills was 'Rita' who had been given a ride by Paul in 1966.  Problem is, she was born in 1968.  While yes, the 'new identity' theory might back that up by 5-10 years, she certainly wouldn't have been a 10 year old accepting a ride at 5 am....  she'd have to be at LEAST 16-17+.

4157497,3,B003NEVW8E,"I love my PRIME subscription. I get to watch some interesting, um, mockumentaries (I guess you'd call it that).

Aside from the fact that George's voice didn't actually sound like George and that some of the albums actually pre-date Paul's actual ""death,"" a lot of it was plausible. That is, until they brought in Heather Mills. Let me explain.

Paul McCartney died in a horrible car accident after storming out of a recording session because of a fight with John Lennon. Driving home, he saw a girl (""Rita"") walking in the rain and offered her a ride. When Rita realized it was Paul, she went ""fan crazy"" and jumping all over him, caused the accident. Rita, of course, survives.

Because MI5 was concerned that girls would commit mass suicide, they gave the recent winner of a Paul McCartney look alike contest plastic surgery and threatened the remaining Beatles with death should they ever reveal the truth.

Tortured by the secret, John Lennon orchestrates all the ""clues"" and symbolism on the albums. In 1980, John called George (on December 1, 1980) to say he was going to reveal the truth. We know what happens next.

MI5, fearing that George, after Lennon's murder, would reveal the truth, sent the lone stabber to his home to take care of him, too. But George survives and records the cassette tapes that are the narration for this documentary. The tapes were sent to the filmmaker anonymously. (Of course they were.)

Fast forward to Linda McCartney's passing and the emergence of Heather Mills, who we learn is really Rita. Apparently MI5 provided Rita with plastic surgery and new life. Faul (""Fake Paul"") has no choice but to marry her or she'll reveal the truth. I guess they forgot to take into account her age. Oops!

Oy! Thank heavens Ringo got away relatively unscathed (minus a couple of insults hurled at him).

And the dubbing of Harrison's 'Faul' vs. 'Paul' in the interviews, yeah, out of synch there, idiots. And someone mentioned the tonal quality being that of documentary cadence. Exactly. No one speaking into a recorder of any kind would have been able to do so in such a manner unless it was done in a studio complete with editing capability, even if they were reading it from an already typed script. Possibly the editing was done later and transferred to micro-cassette tapes, if you really want to stretch the imagination. I doubt George would have had the strength to do this from his hospital room after being stabbed numerous times. And Rita? Being the one who married 'Faul' under another name? Seriously? My first thought was 'Wow, looking good for someone as old as 'Rita' would be right now.' Seriously, very imaginative trash. This person should write fiction for a living, at least then it would be declared fiction.

We've all seen it done countless times in TV shows and entertainment mags. The photo was just flipped to the other side, showing his playing guitar right handed, the same for the video they showed.

It's a well put together documentary, but it begins to repeat itself by showing the same evidence in the Songs written the other Beattles, pictures on album covers, comparative photos of Paul and Faul.

I was totally unaware of this rumor growing up & only recently heard the rumor a few months ago while browsing the internet. Being someone who is a big conspiracy theorist, I found the clues OVERWHELMING! Knowing what I know about governments, (I'm very big on history), its not hard for me to believe. Life is an illusion, only what the powers that be tell you it is. I personally believe this story, regardless of who's telling the story. There are too many details, too many clues in the music, album covers, etc for it not to be true. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in just how sneaky the music/government system really is. A must watch!",1404432000,,813,4.4630872483221475
4157560,4,B003NEVW8E,"""George"" would know that Let It Be was not the last Beatle record recorded. It was recorded after the White Album and before Abbey Road. So that part of the story also ruins the credibility of this film. But maybe that is the point - ruin the credibility of the perceived hoax. And only Faul would benefit from that. Maybe he financed this film! Fess up Faul!

Also, they discovered Billy (Faul) from a Paul McCartney look alike contest, not a sound-alike contest. What are the odds they would find someone who could sing like Paul. Not only that, unless they used a studio musician to play the bass parts and sing (which would have added more credibility to this story, it is quite fortuitous that they found a replacement who is an amazing bass player and singer at the top of his game.

There is plenty of compelling evidence to support the Paul Is Dead theory which were excluded from this film. But this film offers some very interesting reasons why the Beatles WOULD add so many clues to their album art and recordings. And it helps make sense to so many lyrics in the context of Paul's death. So those personal details of why these clues were used, and even some of the clues themselves, lend even more credibility to the theory. And it really makes me think John was more of a genius than I gave him credit. And this leads me to wonder if maybe Faul financed some of the books that have ""re-written"" Beatle history, that is if Paul is really dead.",1403308800,2,1455,4.4456928838951315

I'm English and love piss taking humour, but found this tasteless and degrading for both the Beatles and the viewer. The voice claiming to be George sounds like an American doing his best impersonation of a Liverpudlian accent, while occasionally straying into Brummie territory.

First, the ""narration"" by George Harrison is atrocious. Even I can recognize that it's someone trying terribly hard to affect a Livipudlian accent and failing miserably.

Next, the ridiculousness of the ""reasoning"" behind why George was attacked and John was murdered.  The idea that John would even go along with keeping Paul's death a secret; never mind how he could, is beyond comprehension. John loved Paul dearly and wouldn't have went along with such a charade, even if it were possible.  Then, the manner in which Paul was discovered after the accident is quite laughable, not to mention John's shouting that he's the walrus. Please. *eyeroll*

This film really affects the tone of a ""mockumentary"" that attempts to ride on the coat-tails of the whole ""Paul is Dead"" hoax.  It's made by someone who, either through imagination, research of other ""PID"" ""facts"", or both, manages to weave a tale that uses every Beatle ""benchmark"" to justify their PID ""beliefs"".

It even makes a plausible case for why a secret, British, security agency would have wanted the news of ""Paul's Death"" kept secret.

The film uses a bad voice-over actor that implies he is Harrison,then proceeds to give an entire narration of the film. It is NOT George Harrisons' voice, just some dude with an English accent.

And as such, it is really a hoot to watch, and I cannot recommend it enough if you are drunk or get a kick out of watching people failing in every conceivable fashion.

This documentary is completely fake and there if, ands, or buts about it.

Furthermore, do you think that he would be able to recall lyrics from songs and specific details about album covers in his frail state? George couldn't even recognize some songs as being from The Beatles when him, Ringo, and Paul all got together to finish John's demos in the '90s LOL. Also, this supposed recording from George is ridiculously theatrical; it is almost as if he knew what the finished documentary was going to look like and tailored his speech to it accordingly, or maybe some loser from Highway 61 Entertainment with a horrible Liverpoolian accent did that for him. Do not take my word for it though, watch the movie for yourself and have a good laugh, but I recommend only doing so if you have Amazon Prime because then it's free.

4157583,1,B003NEVW8E,"I streamed this and can agree it was funny, to a point. If you're a Beatles fan and can enjoy loony ""evidence"" taken to extremes, the film is intermittently entertaining (I mean, claiming that Heather Mills caused McCartney's fatal car crash years before she was actually born is pretty hilarious). That claim at least gives anyone watching the film fair warning not to take it seriously (not that that's stopped some people). If you're looking for real insight into the ""Paul is Dead"" mythology, read Andru J. Reeves' book ""Turn Me On, Dead Man."" It's entertaining, factual, and comprehensive.

I'd be more willing to play along with this movie as a fun, if not great, parody if it weren't for two things: the ugliness directed against John Lennon and George Harrison, who aren't here to respond, and what I found out about Joel Gilbert after I looked up the rest of his work.

First, the ugliness against Lennon and Harrison: the film portrays both as long-term liars, and claims that John Lennon engaged in peace activism with Yoko Ono so people would see him as a nut. It's pretty shameful to subject two dead men to that treatment.

Now, Joel Gilbert. After streaming this I looked director Gilbert up on IMDb, and now I wish I could retract any meager encouragement I've given him by watching his McCartney film.

Did you know he's done a film about Elvis not being dead, 2012's ""Elvis Found Alive""? That one claims that Elvis faked his death and went undercover as a federal agent so he could combat the Weather Underground and other radical groups. He's struggled to restart his singing career, but is currently being stymied by (wait for it) the Obama administration. Like the McCartney film, this one was originally billed as a ""documentary"" on Gilbert's site, and is now listed as a ""mockumentary."" (Loren Collins, on freerepublic.com, has a post on ""Gilbert's Mockumentaries"" that describes the way Gilbert has changed his tune about both movies.)

But it's 2012's ""Dreams From My Real Father"" that makes Gilbert look not just shady but sinister. This film is NOT described as a mockumentary. Gilbert's site describes it as making the case that ""Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years."" It ""weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic in an attempt to fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for ""fundamentally transforming America?""

Um, no. But this trumped-up narrative IS an excuse for Gilbert to claim that ""To understand Obama's plans for America, the question is not 'where's the birth Certificate? the question is 'Who is the real father?'""

In fact, the real questions are ""What is Joel Gilbert trying to achieve with the films he's making?"" and ""Do you want to give this guy your time or money?"" Whatever your political perspective, you can find a much more worthy filmmaker to support.",1384128000,,3010,4.913385826771654

8400972,3,B003NEVW8E,"Im giving this as much as three stars for two reasons: Its a well strung-together compilation of most, if not all, of the points of interest that are used to support the Paul Is Dead theory; and its done well enough to hold my interest, even after seeing most, (but not all), of the points and claims on the internet at some point or another.

Now to address the reviews that point out that the voice doesnt sound like George Harrison. Theres a reason for that. Its because it isnt. And thats okay. There was never any claim that the tapes would be used for narration. I believe there may be some tapes. I think they shouldve played an exerpt from one as proof. But I understand why they didnt. If there are, in fact, tapes that sound like they may have come from George Harrison, then the film maker would be in a bit of trouble having them. MI5/MI6 would want them. The U.S. Government may want them. Who knows who else. Theres nowhere they could be safe. So the actual tapes couldn't be used as narration for the film for safety reasons. It has to appear as a piece of fiction for the same reasons that the remaining members of the group have to maintain their silence.
That being said, they also could not use the tapes because they probably don't sound good enough to give proper flow to the film. Theyve no doubt made some minor alterations to whats said on the original tapes, (again, assuming there are tapes).  They probably added some things for dramatic effect, or that George may have missed that the film maker thinks would fit well into their work. I highly doubt that George would call Paul, Faul; even if its not truly the real James Paul McCartney.
They used a voice over actor to narrate and the based the script for the narration on what was on the tapes. They also would need sound quality and background noise reduction that likely wouldnt be available in mini cassette tapes. There is mention of voice over narration in the credits, but the voice of George Harrison is really the only voice narrating and there was no claim that the narrator was, in fact, George Harrison.

Bad decisions to include:  Interview clips that were altered to show the real George Harrison saying things out of order and context than what they were in an interview AND calling Paul, Faul.  Those clips are doctored and the real interview, (and George saying, Paul, not, Faul), is readily available with almost no effort by searching YouTube. Including it here only discredits any decent points otherwise made.

Also, while I do believe Heather Mills knows something important and I believe theres something odd going on there with her...she could not have been alive and old enough to be hitchhiking in 1966.  Bad choice to put that in there. No way the tapes make that claim. It doesnt fit.

Overall, though, its enjoyable and interesting. So I think Paul McCartney actually died in 1966? Im not sure. Id say Im riding right down the middle of the fence on that one. In any case, I still like both the early and late works of The Beatles and I really like the works of Paul (Faul?) McCartney in the 70s with Wings. If the switch happened, it doesnt discredit the talent of William Shears Campbell playing the part of Paul McCartney.

Conclusion: Its an interesting film, but inconclusive in data and still hard to believe on multiple points. This isn't going to change anyones mind on the subject - in either direction. Enjoy it for what it is:  Fiction based on a theory that may have a fairly strong foundation in some unanswered, but undeniable truths.
It would be nice to find out - for sure - some day while Im still on this planet.  There are still at least two people who know for sure. Maybe theyll come forward with a yea or nay some day.",1528329600,,3748,4.5214180206794685
8400973,3,B003NEVW8E,"This is a mockumentary and not to be taken seriously by anyone. Even as a satire, it approaches bad taste by weaving Lennon's murder and Harrison's near death into it's narrative. Those things stated, it's very well done.

I have little patience for conspiracy theories which are typically just empty calories for the most simple minded and bigoted among us. Room 237 was different. It offered an appreciation of the intricate leaps that smart people can make in wholly fictional directions. This does too. It's a great primer on the elaborate mess that is the 'Paul McCartney is Dead' rumor and the astounding lengths to which certain fans have gone to attempt to make it seem plausible.

Rubbish? Yes. Completely. Fascinating? I'd say so, especially for die-hard Beatles fans who've spent enough time obsessing over the group to understand just how easily that could tip over into absurd conclusions.",1527984000,,902,5.046979865771812
8400974,1,B003NEVW8E,Ridiculous. There's no way that's George Harrison. Waste of time. We have enough falsehood in this world; we don't need this.,1525132800,,125,5.0
8400975,5,B003NEVW8E,"This was very well done.  It kept me glued to the computer.  There are many convincing clues John put on the album covers (being a former art student himself and abstract thinker).  I remember when Rubber Soul came out and my first thought was that was not Paul.  I saw something different in Paul's
 eyes.  I could recognize easily John, George, Ringo , Its not George himself narrating. Its an interesting film here. Watch it.",1523923200,,428,4.64
8400976,4,B003NEVW8E,"Nothing anyone says actually proves that it isn't George's voice in this movie. A micro-cassette recording can and will sound like a higher quality recording if it is transferred digitally, processed minimally, and played through speakers bigger than the tiny one on the micro-cassette recorder. Duh. That is not saying that I believe that is George's voice; the accent, inflections, voice etc could PLAUSIBLY be that of the late Mr Harrison. But if he recorded that ""in hospital"" (a bit of Brit grammar ha ha), isn't it unlikely that it would be recorded without hestation and error like it is presented? Wouldn't he have been under narcotics for the the pain? As it is, it sounds like it was scripted.

There's a lot of stuff I didn't see before in the cover art. Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper's, ""White Album,"" all have stuff that I never realized was there (or wasn't there in the case of white album ha ha) and for clues like that and ""backward masking"" audio, this movie is very credible and insightful. The Austin Martin and ""Hear LiES Paul"" on SPLHCB are especially interesting. I will try not to spoil the ""fun."" Conspicuous by it's absence is any mention of the occult which I am sure the Beatles (and here it is mentioned that all the faces on Sgt Peppers were favorites of the real Paul) were interested in ie Aleister Crowley... second head from left on SPLHCB. See my pic for more evidence of the occult and much deeper analysis by others. Speaking of backward masking, anyone can get open-source Audacity and play the songs backwards if they care to prove the backward masking. I'm going to take this guy's word for it cuz there isn't enough time in the day.

I was never a Beatle fan. I was (and still am) a Beatle MANIAC since the needle first hit the vinyl of my ""Beatles '65"" album in 1965 (I still have it). I couldn't believe the ""Paul is dead"" rumours when they first broke. Long time Beatles fans know why. I saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 and they changed my young life like they did for (to?) so many others. Only about two years ago, I saw a documentary video on jtube that shows the trouble some people took to DISPROVE the theory using facial comparisons and wound up doing the opposite. None of the key facial features match. I always thought ""Dr Robert"" was Bob Dylan who is said to have introduced the Beatles to maryjane. There are stills from a movie supposedly made in Kenya with Beatles roadie Mal Evans and Faul available online. No mention of this in the movie but wouldn't it make sense to get Faul the heck out of Blighty to do the plastic surgery?

What I find highly unplausible is that MI5 (or MI6 or the CIA or any ""intelligence"" agency in the world) gave or gives a good damn about teenage suicides. Given their historical track record, the logical assumption is that they would have welcomed the suicides. That is the mindset of psychopathy. I believe the real reason to keep the Beatles alive is simple; distraction. Keeping people in an entertained trance is the objective of many deep state agendas. That way, we don't have time to think about more important things and LOOK at things that ""secret societies"" don't want us to look at. Anyone who thinks that conspiracies like this, JFK, 9/11, geoengineering, and many more are the delusional fantasies of nut-cases ARE the delusional nut-cases themselves.

John was such a brilliant crack-up genius. The Beatles were the best band the world will ever see. I remember the time and place I first heard he was murdered. I was at the Central Park vigil. To experience 10 minutes of absolute silence in a crowd of roughly 10,000 in New York City was a profound experience I shall never forget. I believe he must've felt it. That he was about to blow the lid on Faul we will never know. At this point, I don't even care if Faul is really just Faul. We did get more music after all. What I care about is who was behind John's murder. And right there, my finger points at the CIA with MI5/6 collusion. CIA MK-Ultra victim (""Manchurian Candidate"") Mark Chapman's next hearing is set for August 2018. You heard all of that right, didn't you?

Having said all that, I'm still 50/50 on ""Paul is dead."" The singular thing that would conclusively prove Paul McCartney died would be forensic DNA testing. That's it. Everything else, no matter how plausible and convincing it appears to look and sound, is nothing but conjecture based on speculation. I don't care if Faul himself declared he wasn't Paul. Prove it. DNA. Period.",1523923200,,4523,4.599752168525403

8400978,1,B003NEVW8E,"Obviously, a mockumentary.  Anyone thinking that is George Harrison on those micro-cassettes (which the recordings sound better than any micro cassette I have ever heard-they have no tape hiss and sound studio quality).  This Harrison imposter claiming the girl in the car was Heather Mills is just absolutely insane, she would not be the correct age , for one and it never mentions Linda McCartney dying of cancer, just goes to this threat that MI5 made Paul marry her.  Also says Let It Be was intended to be the last Beatles LP recorded when Abbey Road actually was.  Let It Be was released 2 years after their breakup, having been shelved until Lennon gave the tapes to Phil Spector to finish.  Any real Beatles fan knows what hogwash this is, glad I didn't pay to see it.",1522540800,,776,4.635036496350365
