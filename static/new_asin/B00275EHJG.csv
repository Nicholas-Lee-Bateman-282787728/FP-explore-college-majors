3858437,5,B00275EHJG,"Funny how time flies.  Once upon a time Toy Story's animation style was the leader of the pack and the state of the art, now it's considered standard fare.  But that's ok; once the shine and polish wore off of it the true value in the franchise was exactly what the title says- the Toys' Story.  Thankfully, that hasn't changed.

The movie opens with an incredibly over-the-top playtime fantasy starring the entire cast that leaves you a little breathless and kinda nostalgic with some of the cameos involved.  The plot focuses upon the inevitable period of transition in life: Andy is heading off to college, leaving his childhood behind, and both he and his sister Molly have to decide what to do with their old toys. His destined for the attic, save Woody, whom Andy decides to take with him.  Molly donates hers to the local day care, including her Barbie doll (raise your hand if you can see it coming!).  A mistake has Andy's toys left out for garbage; Woody goes to rescue his friends and they manage to all end up at the day care center- a Garden of Eden for toys.  But there are snakes in the garden as things are not quite what they seem, leaving them worse off than before.  Now they have to find a way to escape and make it back to Andy's before he leaves.

The typically superior Pixar animation is flawless, and the script is excellent- I'd have to say this was more for adults than kids. Woody remains his loyal, inventive self and there's always the iconic Buzz Lightyear gravity (and logic)-defying flight across the room.  Sight gags abound and one-liners zing, but the best laughs came from the running jokes about the inevitable `When Barbie meets Ken' scenario (""No one else around here understands clothes!""), as well as the age-old question about Ken- is he or isn't he?  There's also some hilarious moments surrounding the romance between Buzz and Jessie the Cowgirl: Buzz gets brainwashed by the bad guys and his friends need to restore him to normal.  A tip: try not to be eating anything once Buzz gets his buttons pushed.

The key to the Toy Story movies is they never take themselves too seriously even in their sentimental and poignant moments, and there were quite a few of those here.  The villain's character arc is perfectly appropriate for a toy movie, and ties into the main plot of the toy's search for a new home.  The ending definitely tugs at your heart strings but works very well; I honestly couldn't see it coming out any other way.  And as is the current trend in movies, you definitely need to stick around for the credits!  Toy Story 3 runs the risk of being overshadowed by other flicks this summer, but it shouldn't be. Go to Infinity and Beyond in order to see this one!",1276819200,9,2719,4.559670781893004
3858438,5,B00275EHJG,"I went to the San Francisco Film Festival screening at Pixar Studios last night not really knowing what to expect. Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise (""Little Mermaid 3"", anyone?). Well, shame on me for underestimating the capabilities of Pixar, who once again have shown how a small studio in Emeryville is a storytelling powerhouse that leaves the rest of the industry in the dust.

Toy Story 3 is the tale of Andy, the toys' owner, going to college and their quest to determine their future - headed between the attic or a daycare center. If you've enjoyed the way the first two films blend character drama with innovative action and humor, this cocktail hits its stride in the third film, which draws on everything we already know about the characters and then adds two new entire sets of toys to the plot. There's a new villain, two very amusing romance sub-plots and a litany of visual gags that push the envelope even further. I'm not allowed to go into any details but the second half of the film is a familiar set piece performed in a completely new way that will forever change your view of certain toys and day care centers.

Apart from a level of animation that sets the bar in the industry and an attention to detail that makes you wonder what most ""real"" films actually do in pre-production, the real genius of the third film is to provide a satisfying conclusion that gives every character a completed character arc. About 20 minutes before the end, I was wondering how they would do this since there were some fairly dark moments (similar to those in Wall-E and Up), but naturally they manage to pull it together. There's literally not a single wasted shot, let alone a wasted scene, and the pace quickens throughout to keep the tension mounting.

Overall, this is another Pixar classic that easily has enough for both kids and adults (and movie aficionados). It's not difficult to see why each of their movies takes five years to complete - yet despite the technical wizardry, the success of their movies is fundamentally routed in their stories, a fact which most other studios seem to forget these days. As to whether the stage is set for Toy Story 4, I suppose they could always pull it off given the creativity at work here, but I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this the last in the series.",1276300800,178,2537,4.571428571428571

Andy (John Morris) has grown up and graduated from high school. He will be leaving for college soon. His mother (Laurie Metcalf) wants him to choose what in his room will go to the trash, to the attic or the day care center as a donation. Andy is not ready to part with his toy box of toys and doesn't want to think about it right now, but his mother makes him. So Andy gets a trash bag and puts all the toys in there to take up to the attic. He keeps Woody (Tom Hanks) and puts him in his college box. He drops the bag to help his sister. His mother sees the bag and takes it out to the trash.  A garbage truck is coming. Woody tries to save the other toys, but cleverly, the toys save themselves and make it to the donations box in the car of Andy's mother. Along with Woody, they are all driven to Sunnyside Day Care.  The toys like Sunnyside and want to stay. Woody leaves and wants to find Andy.
  Meanwhile, not all is sunny at this day care. The kids are too rough with the toys and one toy is not so nice after all.

In Toy Story 3, the villain is once again another toy that was abandoned who has now become a dictator over the toys in a day care center. Pretty intense stuff for younger ones (would say below five...my son picked up on the ""bad guy"" but didn't quite understand why he was the way he was).",1466726400,2,433,4.2926829268292686

3859007,5,B00275EHJG,"The best thing Pixar did with this movie is allow Andy to grow up real time with the viewers of the first 2 films. 11 years after the release of Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 was released with Andy getting ready to head off to college. This movie addresses the dilemma that every toy faces; their kid growing up and trying to figure out ""What happens next?"" For the toys we've come to know and love, the fear of abandonment and mistakenly being thrown out pushes them to hitch a ride to Sunnyside Daycare, where they meet a whole host of other toys and a villainous one who wants to keep them locked up in the room for the toddlers who don't know how to properly play with toys. The movie quickly switches gears from ""Happily ever after"" for the characters to a ploy to escape from Sunnyside.
I won't spoil the ending! But I think it was beautiful and did the Toy Story characters justice and let them end their story with dignity.

3859339,5,B00275EHJG,"I hadn't seen Toy Story 3 until recently.  I have a toddler and he loved the first two so I rented Toy Story 3 for him and it has become his favorite movie.  He would watch it on repeat all day long if I allowed him to.  Its fun, action packed and exciting.  He thinks the characters are hilarious and has become very fond of Mr Potato Head, so much so that we had to buy him one and he holds him the entire time he watches the movie.  Its a cute, wholesome movie that is fun for the entire family.  I love that each of the three movies has its own very different theme and they do not get old or repetitive.",1453852800,,608,3.902439024390244

3859359,2,B00275EHJG,"Couldn't help but feel like I've seen this film before, like they interwove far too many other elements from prison films into this final account of the toys winding up at a day care center. The Ken and Barbie bits were funny but otherwise the film had a depressing atmosphere of finality to it, primarily at the end where they all face a giant incinerator?!  Seriously, what morbid, dark place were the writers going through in their lives? The final toy parting seemed a little odd, with the college kid attached to his toys, but maybe that's just a millennial mindset thing I just don't understand.

A general thought about the three Toy Story films: in a day and age when their are security cameras everywhere, and everyone has a phone with a video recorder, how come no one ever sees these animated toys ever? (except for the bully in the first film?)  Reading into it too much I guess...",1453161600,,893,4.56875

Have you ever noticed that? How looking back, it seems they grow up in a BLINK? Anyway, as I got weepy here and there during the film, my son just smiled knowingly and put his arm around me and hugged me. Less than two years later, I lost my son suddenly. In that same 'blink', he was gone. I will never ever be able to watch the movie again, but the memory of that first time? Sharing it with my son? I will have it in my heart FOR ALWAYS. I am...feeling very emotional...recalling it now. It is a lovely, very special film and I *strongly* recommend sharing it with your child (or children).",1448150400,,769,4.167785234899329

3859449,5,B00275EHJG,"Recommended age range 6+ years old and up (adults would enjoy this movie as well)

This movie wrapped up the Toy Story Series quite well. The third has Andy packing up for college and leaving his toys behind, unintentionally and intentionally.

Again, Pixar has proved itself with Toy Story 3. Im convinced Pixar can't stop making amazing work. Toy Story 3 entertains its audiences with observations of the life cycle. It looks at the different aspects and process of human mortality  while at the same time giving its audience incredibly satisfying suspense. Toy Story 3 takes dark and  scary moments and boldly pushes those concepts to viewers, therefore, leaving me to recommend parents to only have their ""older"" kids such as 6+ years old to view this movie. However you want to keep in mind that even so, you kid might have nightmares from this movie because of its references such as the baby toy's broken eye, and the terrifying screeching monkey.

The animation also has greatly improved from Toy Story and Toy Story 2. The first was released in 1995 and the second was released in 1999, which when compared to Toy Story 3 in 2010 is a far ways- leaving an approximate 5 year gap between each release. When the first Toy Story movie in this series was released, most movies that were created using computer animation were not too advanced. Nowadays, our animation films look like real life characters ""acting"", kind of like a live-action film. Toy Story 3 really displays this and looks realistic (other than the fact that the art style is ""cartoon-ish"") almost like I can grab anything from the movie in person.

The action in this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat and is an incredibly enjoyable experience especially starting from the beginning of the movie such as when Woody is posed in a battle against Dr. Porkchop and One-Eyed Bart in a dilemma where they want to bring the orphans to a broken railroad track to their deaths.

Overall, this movie brings great suspense, as well as tears to its audience and is a film you should watch at least once. I've seen this movie about 3 times so far and if you are looking into seeing it for your first time, I would highly recommend you watch it.",1447027200,,2212,4.656410256410257

3860114,5,B00275EHJG,"When the original Toy Story came out in 1995, I wanted to see it just because it was the first computer animated movie.  But I left the theater in love with all things Pixar.  They haven't let me down yet, but I will admit I was a little worried about Toy Story 3 since sequels don't usually hold up.  I don't know why I was worried; this is Pixar.  The movie is wonderful.

Time has passed for our friends in Andy's room, and Andy (still voiced by John Morris) is getting ready to go to college.  Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and the gang that is left haven't been played with in ages.  Some of our friends have even left at yard sales over the years.

Andy is trying to figure out what to do with the toys he still has when, through a misunderstanding, they think he has thrown them away.  They quickly donate themselves to the Sunnyside Day Care Center.  While they are thrilled at the prospect of being played with again, the center has a dark side, too.  Will they survive their new home?  Will they ever learn that Andy wasn't trying to throw them away?

The movie starts right out with play time that reminds us of the first two movies.  I had a smile on my face within minutes.  And that smile continued as the movie progressed.

Yes, this is a comedy, and I was laughing pretty hard at some of the scenes.  In fact, I would guess that the adults were laughing more than the kids.  The scenes between Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodi Benson) were hysterical.  Plus there's what happens to Buzz (if you've seen the trailers, you know what I'm talking about).  And 10 points to anyone who can catch the Scooby Doo reference.

But I was also caught up in the story.  Things got bogged down for a few minutes in the middle, but it wasn't long before I was fully caught up in the story again.  The climax wasn't quite as complex as some of Pixar's climaxes-that-will-not-quit have been in the past, it did still provide several unforeseen complications that kept me on the edge of my seat.  That is when I wasn't laughing at how they worked something from the very first movie into the climax.

The voice cast was wonderful once again.  While Andy is still a minor character, I love the fact that they still used John Morris for his voice.  The only actor they changed was Blake Clark who took over for his friend, the late Jim Varney, as Slinky Dog.  It was only after the movie was over that I questioned just how much Slinky said, but when he was talking, I never noticed a difference in the actor's voice.

There were times I missed the ensemble characters who were written out of the film.  Fortunately, the movie got going quickly and moved at such a steady pace that I didn't have time to mourn their loss for long.  Plus we get a lot of great new characters who do help fill things out.

One reason sequels can disappoint is because they will just re-dress the same plot from the first movie.  While a few of the plot elements here did feel recycled, I always felt like we were watching something that was a truly new effort.  The themes definitely felt recycled, although they did continue to build on them here like they did in the first sequel.  Some retreading is bound to happen, but I felt like they did a good job of keeping it to a minimum and instead building on what we have already seen.

What was not recycled was the animation.  You can definitely tell a difference between the first and second movie.  Well, that's nothing compared to how things look here.  The humans look so much better than the first one.  There are only a couple of shots that will blow you away (and I didn't watch it in 3D), but it all looked great to me.

Parents might want to know that a couple of scenes get intense and might frighten young kids.  The one sitting next to me didn't seem to have any problems, but you can judge your kids best.  They also have a very small part with sub-titles.  That seems a bit strange to me for a movie aimed at kids, but I can't complain too loudly since I was laughing so hard at those parts.

Which brings us to the ending.  I'm not going to give anything away, don't worry.  All I want to say is it is very bittersweet.  A friend who saw it opening night recommended bring tissue.  I wish I had listened to him.  This grown man had very wet eyes by the time it was over, but I wouldn't have changed a thing.  It was absolutely perfect.

As much as I have loved these characters, I do hope they stop here.  We've had a great ride, but this one provides some good closure.  I feel like Toy Story 3 brings things full circle.  I know I'll be watching it many more times to come.",1430870400,6,4629,4.289017341040463

3860575,5,B00275EHJG,"Like an old slugger on the downswing of his career, under the right circumstances Pixar can still knock the ball out of the park. Toy Story 3 is living proof, vivid and playful and touching and meaningful at or above the lofty levels of their mid-peak masterworks. With a true ensemble cast, it allows the old stars to spin their familiar spells while tossing in a few new supporting players (Michael Keaton as Barbie's beau Ken is especially entertaining) but wisely doesn't focus on any single character for too long. With a roster this well developed, still clicking deep in their third feature, why not celebrate that kind of rare, wonderful diversity? I'm glad Pixar waited to tell the right story, too: the level of care, meaning and power that's on display here simply doesn't come around all that often. Let's do it right or not at all, yeah? Needless to add, it's a stunner visually, with brighter colors, more brilliant settings and no shortage of Pixar charm fitting right in alongside the timeless character designs and visual themes of the two preceding films. An essential tale that's effectively moving, sweet, heartfelt and hilarious... and maybe even the best chapter of the trilogy.",1417392000,,1200,4.916256157635468

3860778,4,B00275EHJG,"Is it possible to have two Toy Story films in your top 10 favorite movies of all time? It is now. Toy
Story 2 was a masterful lesson in suspension of disbelief. By the end of the film, the viewer will subscribe

to each and every crazy turn in the action. In Toy Story 3, the storytellers have done the same but with
even more superior character development.
As in all of the Toy Story films, the characters in Toy Story 3 find themselves in an impossible situation
(no spoilers here). Instead of the standard panic and pandemonium, the characters do something
unbelievably tender and moving--they look toward one another for a moment then hold each others hands.
And by this point in the movie, you love these characters; you're inspired by Woodys loyalty, impressed
by Buzzs courage, charmed by Jesses spirit. These are characters you believe.
Dont be fooled by what may seem like greener grass, embrace lifes changes, and be true to the people
you love (and those not so lovable). These are the timeless themes in Toy Story 3 that make the film truly
amazing. Its storyline is never juvenile despite the fact that all the kids enjoy the film just as much as the
adults (and really we have the most to gain from watching it!)and thats what makes it a masterpiece.
There have been a lot of great trilogies in filmthis one tops them all.",1408406400,,1337,4.570833333333334

I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out and my son was in high school and I cried!  Then, when he went off to college for the 1st time, watched it again, and cried.

My daughter loves that Barbie meets Ken in this one. I also thought the second movie was a little dark, while this one had some dark parts, I didn't feel it was nearly as dark as the second film.

However, while the first Toy Story was a big novelty, now Toy Story 3 seems a little formulaic and not especially ground breaking.  The concept of decent story, big name actors, and cool new graphics was done well the first time, but I was kind of expecting an upward trajectory by the third iteration, something new, different, better?  Computers are always improving after all.  It was just sort of a continuation of the same story, and I found myself a little tired of it.",1398297600,,578,4.683168316831683

As with the first two, plenty for the little ones to enjoy, but there's also a lot going for adults to enjoy, both from a humor and storyline standpoint. Things do get pretty heavy towards the end, even pretty scary at one point...I'm not a great judge when it comes to this, but I'd say if your kids are younger than 6, parental guidance advised.",1398211200,,422,4.3544303797468356

It's that well done. Nothing's as sad as ""Paranorman"" - but this comes close, in the same winning way. Oh, and that ethnic dance number? That's a Spanish animator parodying the flamenco.

As for Mr. Clark and other new additions to the voice cast, I only have one question...how does PIXAR always get absolutely the right people?  This film was the end of an eara...and the toys went out with a bang.  Is it just me or did we see a lot more of Andy's mom than before?  And when did she become a blond?

3861278,1,B00275EHJG,"With Toy Story 3, Pixar has achieved a feat I would never in a million years have thought possible - except this time, that is no compliment. The first two Toy Story films were both staples of my childhood and among Pixar's great accomplishments (and this is saying quite a lot, as they have many). Unfortunately, the value of those films has been tarnished by a pointless and depressing third installment that misses the mark entirely. Let me be clear - it's a rarity for Pixar to make a bad film. And Toy Story 3, while inferior in quality to the previous installments, isn't by any means poorly-made. It's just a story I happen to disagree with.

Before I had reached the ending, I found the movie to be okay (considering it was the sequel of a sequel) although it couldn't hold a candle to the previous two. It was somewhat lower on character development, not really revealing anything about the main characters while introducing new ones who generally remained underdeveloped and added nothing to the plot. The script didn't sparkle as much thanks to the relative absence of the hilarious one-liners which had partly defined the other films. Woody's fight with the monkey was only filler and didn't tie into the rest of the plot like the battle with Zurg in Toy Story 2 did. The main villain was indeed strange, as his motivation made little sense. He devotes his life to making other toys miserable with the justification of, ""We're all just junk for getting thrown out!"" This is because his owner has abandoned him - entirely by mistake, however, as he is well aware.

But then the ending came and what respect I had for the film dropped to nil. I felt as if the whole series had been dumped down a giant garbage incinerator. It seemed to be saying that to grow up, you have to stamp out every little remnant of your childhood - even your most treasured possessions - something I disagree with strongly. What is an adulthood, devoid of the celebration and remembrance of childhood? I felt as if some pathetic nihilist was trying to force their view of life on me, that this was the ending the makers of the film wanted, not that the audience wanted.

Anyway, aren't adults supposed to be part of the audience of these movies? If we can take these toys into our adulthoods with us, then why the heck shouldn't Andy ever see them again? Why not have an ending that completes what the first two movies were doing: offering us adults back a little piece of our childhoods? Instead of asking us to leave everything we gained from these films behind us?

Some fans insist we needn't take the ending literally. The problem is that to give a literal demonstration of something should be precisely the film's purpose, just as Toy Story 1 and 2 were meant to show how children actually think of their toys. I agree, there are some things we must let go of as we grow up, but this is a film about toys, not toys that merely serve as a stand-in for some other part of childhood we really do need to permanently lose.

There is also something else problematic. Wasn't the whole point of Toy Story 2 that Woody chose to accept the inevitability of his abandonment? That movie centers around Woody's fear of returning home to Andy, after he realizes that Andy will one day grow up and put him away on the shelf, like Wheezy. At one point, Stinky Pete even asks Woody if he really thinks Andy will take Woody on his honeymoon, which implies that Woody would still belong to Andy after college. Finally, Woody realizes the right thing to do is to go back to Andy. The film ends with him declaring that he's accepted everything won't last forever, but he will just enjoy it while it does.

All that being said, I don't believe I would have preferred a film which ended with these toys being forced to spend over a decade in Andy's attic. Perhaps it simply isn't possible to make a satisfying Toy Story film with a grown-up Andy. This series worked best when it was confined to exploring childhood, and perhaps it should have stayed there. Otherwise, what's next? Christopher Robin getting rid of Winnie the Pooh? Calvin getting rid of Hobbes?",1377129600,7,4131,4.560646900269542

3861318,4,B00275EHJG,"This review is for the Single Disc DVDs content, not the plot of movie (which gets a gajillion stars from me)

Disney has been frustrating me of late with it's recently reissued DVDs and newer releases, releasing the (overpriced) Blu-ray combo packs and Diamond editions first and single disc DVDs a month later. I usually wait for the DVD since I don't have a Blu-ray player and have no need for two versions of the same movie. Sadly, Disney no longer releases two disc versions on DVD only and the single disc DVDs seem to be very bare bones (like Wreck It Ralph).  This was a pleasant surprise.

The disc itself has artwork on it, unlike the more recent releases that have a plain gray disc with the title stamped on it. This has a nice colorful feel to it. It also has a decent amount of special features, including some behind the scenes interviews with the cast and crew.  I still wish I could buy a two disc DVD version like I did with Toy Story 1 and 2, which had LOADS of extras, but I'll settle for this one. I'm satisfied with this.  If you're a Pixar or Toy Story lover who likes special features but doesn't need an entire disc of them, then this is the right choice. It had just the right amount of extras to make me happy and not feel like I'm completely missing out on the experience by not having a Blu-ray.

3861325,3,B00275EHJG,"The first TS was a pioneering masterpiece and set the standard for all future CGI animation. TS2 was a hip follow up classic with dynamite story to suit the action, and the introduction of some really great characters. This movie also had a special group singing Woody's Round-up along with some other cowboy extension songs off the movie plot.
TS3 is obviously a way for the TS franchise to gracefully exit out into the sunset, and there's actually a soap opera overtone to the gangs fear of being cast aside when Andy goes to college, finding new ground in a kiddie kamp or school only to find another sob story in a bear who has a chip on his shoulder for having once been replaced. Then Buzz Lightyear has been given a lobotomy by the conniving bear to make him his servant. The only real comic figure here seems to be the introduction of Ken who actually has fun with his part to the extreme of model fashioning for Barbie, in disco no less.
The rest is trial & tribulation, with an additional ending of Andy finally giving up his beloved toy favorites to a neighborhood girl. I would have much preferred if the toys found a way to hijack into Andy's car just as he thought he had given them up for good leaving the little girl clueless as to what happened to her new found friends. That's the TS I'd know!",1373846400,,1311,4.399176954732511

Young children and rather old people (like me) can enjoy it together. It is a remarkable story told in a very entertaining way. I have worked in the computer industry for almost 40 years and I still am amazed and delighted by CGI. This movie uses it to it's best effect.

3861390,1,B00275EHJG,"There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.

If so, why would Disney prevent you from watching your digital movie on more than one monitor simultaneously?

I have a dual monitor graphics card; at first I couldn't figure out why the Disney movies wouldn't play on any of my two monitors. Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played. Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer. I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.

So beware. If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen. Why did Disney do this? Control? They don't believe you own it?

Whatever the reason, it's not good for business.",1370822400,6,1208,4.355555555555555

3861422,5,B00275EHJG,"I've loved each and every Toy Story movie that's come out and the third one is equally wonderful.  Thes is my favorite animated movie series, with Shrek coming in a close second (mainly because Shrek 3 was terrible).  Each Toy Story movie has expanded the universe of toys and the issues that they have to deal with, issues that reflect our own lives.

Toy Story 3 takes place at a turning point in the lives of Andy's remaining toys as he is pretty much grown up and off to college.  Will they end up going with him, be sent off to the attic, or thrown out?  In the end, his toys accidentally end up at a daycare run by another group of toys who are led by a sweet fuzzy bear named Lotso who smells of strawberries.  But things are not what they seem and Woody and Buzz and the rest of their friends need to figure out a way of the mess they've ended up in, pulling together once more to help each other.

We meet even more toys in this movie, some familiar and some new.  Favorite scenes include the Dreamhouse one as Ken tries to impress Barbie with his clothes.  Mr Potatohead's troubles with a pigeon.  Plus, the final scene (which I won't give away) but is sweet and sad together and just perfect for the ending of the movie.

One of the new characters, the cymbal-clanging monkey, is a bit freaky and might be uncomfortable for smaller kids.  Big Baby also has his freaky moments.  The dangers that the good guys get into can be a big too real for some younger watchers...but so were some scenes from the previous movies, including Toy Story 1 with the creepy toys in the bad kids room made out of parts of other toys and threatening to blow up Buzz.

The animation just keeps on getting better in these movies and Toy Story 3 comes in second only to Toy Story 1 for innovation and creativity.  Highly recommended.  None of the movies have disappointed and Toy Story 3 is well worth owning.",1369094400,2,1897,4.331444759206799

3861459,5,B00275EHJG,"There are many times sequals fall flat and you know it, and there are many sequals that seem to fit seamlessly into the first story, not losing any continuity along the way. This is one of the latter,and I am glad of it. Toy Story 3 is a wonderful ending to a great three part story and worth every accolade given. Woody and Buzz find themselves seemingly forgotten as Andy grows up and is getting ready for college. In the rush for him to get ready, Andy is reminded he still has his toys in the chest in his room and must decide what to do with them. When he starts packing them away to take to the attic, he rediscovers Woody and Buzz and decides to take Woody with him to College while the other toys, Buzz included will go to the attic. His sister, is also clearing out some things to donate to a day school and needs some help. In the process, the bag of toys being sent to the attic gets mixed up and mistaken for trash by their mother. Woody attempts to help his friends escape and while he is a little late, discovers to his relief that they have freed themselves but is appalled to learn they have decided to go to Sunnydale, believing that they had been thrown away. Woody's attempt to talk them out of it comes to an abrupt end when the car door slams and he is trapped and going to Sunnydale with them. When they arrive, they are met by Lotso Hugging Bear who assures everyone they have made the right choice and that they are in a better place. Woody however, chooses not to remain and leaves in a huff while the beautiful world the others have entered rapidly turns sour when they find the kids in the room they have been assigned are too young and too rough. Things get worse when they discover Lotso is no one's friend and rules Sunnydale with an iron hand. On his way home, Woody is found and rescued by a liitle girl and taken to her home and it is there he discovers what really happened to his friends and he is torn between trying to get back before Andy leaves or rescuing his friends from their terrible predicament. He chooses to go back and finds a way to free his friends resulting in an effort worthy of ""the Great Escape"". Freeing Buzz, however has a seriously funny side complication when he returns in Spanish mode and in the midst of their escape starts to romance Jessie the Cowgirl. The escape is nearly thwarted by Lotso, but Big Baby throws him into the trash and manages to pull Woody in as well and when the truck comes all are taken to the dump and Woody and Buzz face their greatest menace ever When Lotso betrays them and leaves them behind to perish. This is a bit darker than the other two, but the story is amazing. A great cast and great effects makes this well worth watching, and it's a keeper!",1366848000,2,2741,4.262955854126679

3861561,5,B00275EHJG,"Technically this 3-D version is way ahead of the previous ""Toy Story"" films, and the stereo effect is impeccable.  Version 3 will probably appeal to more adults than the previous two, in that it is more retrospective and opens the door to  where
the boy grows up and, thanks to his developing new priorities finds a way to lovingly say good-bye to his childhood friends (the toys).
In fact, the emotional aspect was so touching that it caused me, a mature adult, to shed some tears.  When a film strikes an emotional chord in me without going for cheap sentimentality, I know it's a work of art!",1363651200,,595,4.542056074766355

3861598,5,B00275EHJG,"When Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2 were finished, I did not expect for a third one: I thought the saga was complete. But years later, when I grew up as teenager, and another movie was announced, I felt happy and nervous.

Happy because there was a chance to repeat all old-childhood memories. Nervous because I was older than before, and I had watched many films in which the sequels did not work or were terrible. I was afraid that this was going to happen to my favorite kid-franchise.

When I first watched in cinemas, in 3D, I really did not care about the 3D: I was crying, yeah! as you read: in the first scene I couldn't hold up some tears. The movie was beautiful, the story catches you completely, and you are part of the plot. I mean, in Toy Story 1 and 2 we all were kids, as Andy was. Then, in 2010, This generation and I were teenagers, and Andy grew up with us. This was so touching, and I think I will not live and experience like this anymore in the theatre.

I do not care if this movie gained the Oscar Award, it gained more: the hearts of all the kids or teenagers who accompanied Woody and Buzz in their adventures. These movies are more than classics now. You actually cannot die without watching them!",1360972800,2,1221,4.254310344827586

It's a great movie, I really liked how they finished the story. My daughter walks around saying ""Buzz"" when she wants to see it. We haven't watched it on DVD yet or the Digital copy so I can't comment on that part, but the blu-ray works perfect in our PS3. I highly recommend the Toy Story series, it's a must see for all ages.

3861700,5,B00275EHJG,"So rarely does an event like this occur. Do I speak of the fifteen-year span of a trilogy? The immense critical success of a third film in a trilogy? Or am I simply speaking of the incredible blend of entertainment for the third consecutive time in a series for children and adults alike. I was fortunate enough to experience this trilogy from childhood to adulthood, although I really grew up watching Disney's classic traditionally animated films, which have now become more or less obsolete.

The rage of 3 dimensional computer animated films has been in full swing since after the original Toy Story was released in 1995 and blew minds, now that a revolutionary 3D technology has been introduced to cinemas it's becoming even more popular. Pixar has achieved what has been perceived as almost impossible by producing hit after hit after hit, financially and critically, some not as much as others. The only way to understand Toy Story 3 and the impact and significance of the series it is to see the first 2 films, highly recommended in Blu-Ray or 3D. After being introduced to many lovable characters in the Toy Story cast and growing up with them, a big theme in the franchise, they become like intimate pals, characters that you can rely on to be the same time and time again.

What this 3rd and almost assuredly final film does is take you to a very, very real and inevitable place, an ending. This can be a hard thing to accept because like many things in life you don't want this journey to end but like all things in life it has to at some point or another. After being attached to characters like this and seeing it all come to an end it is quite hard to keep a dry eye throughout the course of the film. In closing comments Toy Story has truly become an extremely important franchise, not only for the history of animated films, but for movies of all time.",1356393600,,1869,4.543026706231454

3861722,5,B00275EHJG,My 10 yr old said it was the best Toy Story because it had a lot of suspense. She liked the part about the giant claw that rescued the toys.,1356393600,,140,3.7
3861723,5,B00275EHJG,A very satisfying finish for our favorite collection of toys as Andy departs for college. I wish the villian had a more painful ending because he certainly deserved it.,1356393600,,168,4.827586206896552
3861724,5,B00275EHJG,"I can rewatch this film, again and again.  There are so many levels to this film.  The plot and character development is superb.  This beats a majority of the non-animated films that are produced each year.",1356393600,,206,4.666666666666667

8354034,5,B00275EHJG,"I grew up watching Toy Story 1 and 2 but after so many years, I wasn't really excited to learn that they were coming out with a third installment. I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I thought, the first two movies were so great, it's time has passed. I actually only watched this because I was at someone else's house and couldn't get their streaming service working. So I just grabbed one of his dvds which happened to be this movie, and genuinely thought I would be bored to sleep but I was wrong and I'm so happy that I was. This movie was truly wonderful! I absolutely loved the story of the toys being donated and really interacting with a whole new crew. Villians are so important to films for me and this movie did not disappoint. I'm happy that so many of the original voice actors returned, as well as being impressed with the new additions, like Michael Keaton. I was surprised and so very emotional near the end. I will freely admit to many tears falling. I hear that there is another movie in the works and I cannot wait to see it!",1527033600,,1049,4.303030303030303
