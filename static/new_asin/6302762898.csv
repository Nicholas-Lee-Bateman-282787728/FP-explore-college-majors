507034,5,6302762898,"This movie is hauntingly beautiful. When i first saw it, I was absolutely in awe at the raw beauty of it. It grabbed my heart and made it beg for absolute mercy. I loved it even though it made me weep several times over. There is no ""happy ending"" to this film as Americans would have it. In this way it doesn't underestimate the viewer, it just makes them realize that life is all things; paiful, delightful, sensuous, disastrous. I recommend this movie highly.",975110400,22,462,4.511904761904762
507035,4,6302762898,"This is a story about Antoine, played by Jean Rochefort, who because of a pleasureable experience with a local woman hairdresser at the age of twelve, becomes obsessed with the idea of one day marrying a hairdresser. So when one day many years later he walks into a hairdressing salon and finds there a beautiful woman with a lovely smile and a charming manner, he asks her to  marry him and she agrees. Just like that.
Now if you like poetic, romantic fantasy, then you'll love this. But, on the other hand, if, like me, you prefer a slice of real life with real characters you can believe in, doing things that make sense, then you'll find that this film leaves a lot to be desired.
We are asked to believe that a beautiful lone woman hairdresser, played by Anna Galiena, is so desperate to get married that she is willing to accept an offer of marriage from an unprepossessing older man, a man she knows nothing about and with whom she has exchanged no more than a couple of words! A likely story. It might have rung more true if he had been George Clooney, but as it is, it seemed to me preposterous. Men would have been flocking in from miles around to  have their hair cut by such as charmer. She would have been spoilt for choice.
But the unreality doesn't stop there. They live together in a state of supreme bliss for ten years in a kind of time-capsule without apparently having any friends or relations and without the salon changing one iota. And then at the end of that time she commits suicide - not because she is unhappy but because she is too happy and is fearful of a time arriving when he will stop loving her and she will no longer be happy. Does that make sense to you?
Even so, as in  most French films the ending tugs at your heart-strings. Throughout nearly the whole course of the film  we have watched her moving about her salon and going to the pay-desk. The whole place, with her bright presence in it, has become very familiar. Now  suddenly she is not there anymore. He is sitting alone. And we experience her loss almost as much as he does.",971481600,,2071,4.368831168831169
507036,5,6302762898,"European Cinema at it's best. Very tender and poetic - one of my 3 favourite films. The Rochefort's character somehow KNOWS the hairdresser is waiting for him somewhere and it does not matter how he spends his life  before he meets her. And he does not give a damn - see him dance. We do not  see him mature, get a job, serve in the army - it all unimportant. Just a  childhood dream coming true - as was expected. The sad thing that there is  AFTER, not only BEFORE, and his wife is not going to stay. There were just  a few options to finish the movie - the lovers could just go on living  happily ever after - but then they'd be entering the saccharine realm of  Mrs. Nora Efron. Double suicide is a bit melodramatic. Frankly it's a no win  game. Any ending is not suitable for this movie. But it does not matter.  All the ""events"" are just a prelude to the pure magic of the  dream fulfilled.
I am not even sure it happens in the real life. Maybe  he has reached his nirvana in a dream and the wife's death is a metaphor  for waking up alone.",945129600,7,1046,4.098522167487685
507037,5,6302762898,"This truly unique film goes deep inside the development of a man's true love for the woman of his dreams.  What appears to be a fixation rooted from childhood feelings towards a hairdresser and the good-feeling they  represent, is a unique love that spurs pure from the heart.  In return, the  recipient of this love is also a giver and the relationship these two  people share is greater than any outsider can understand.  A twist in the  end of this picture forces one to analyze the true passion this couple had  for each other.  A refreshing unique expression of love is displayed here,  which sets itself apart from the typical boy meets girl film.  As most  foriegn films dicate:  God is in the Details.

507082,1,6302762898,"Such great reviews for such a shallow flick.  These two can't even be called ""star-crossed"" lovers.  It's more like the hairdresser is in a state of ennui and the guy is obsessed with hairdressers--not just any hairdresser, of course.  She has to be devoid of character and willing to give up even the pretention of interacting with anyone but him.  Their encounters with others are superficial and parodies of true human interaction and caring.  In fact, tho, no one in this whole film cares about anyone else.

507142,5,6302762898,"I loved this intriguing and entertaining fable. It's about a realized dream for an alienated pre-adolescent boy, Antoine, who suffers indignities while growing up in the late 1940's. One haircut with a full-figured local hairdresser is enough for him to develop a fixation on her tantalizing half-exposed breasts. When she turns up dead in her salon from an overdose of barbiturates, he is deeply affected. The film jumps forward and we are introduced to Mathilde, an enigmatic young beauty. She is the new solo proprietor of a simple hair salon for men only. Antoine reappears as a selfish, rather shallow, and oddly disagreeable middle-aged man who discovers her shop and comes in for haircuts. Without so much as having coffee together, he proposes marriage and she improbably accepts. What? Why? It looks like a colossal mismatch. As things develop you get lulled into thinking, oh well, it works for them. He loves her as the fetish she represents. She in turn is pleased to gratify his needs and love him unconditionally. Seeing her attend to another man's hair stirs him sexually. He takes liberties to prove he controls her, body and soul. The mysterious Mathilde is a tabula rasa, a blank slate whom we attempt to make sense of. It's near impossible. Towards the end she surprisingly states apropos of nothing, ""Life is disgusting"" (at least that's what the subtitles tell us). It's our only clue and its totally out of context. Occasionally Antoine pops a cassette into a boom box and plays his favorite cacophonous Middle Eastern music, to which, befitting his eccentricity, he performs a wacky dance. I was charmed by the film's beautiful color and warmed by its luminosity. You'll see what I mean and I'm sure you'll be charmed too. After the movie, watch the Anna Galiena interview, a bonus feature on the DVD. Leconte made it a challenge to fathom Antoine and Mathilde's relationship and to understand the nature of Antoine and Mathilde themselves. The whole production - everything that went into making this movie is uniquely fine art. A museum piece.",1300320000,3,2068,4.962536023054755
507143,5,6302762898,"I saw this foreign film years ago. I remembered I enjoyed it's offbeat humor.
I never bought the film but wished I had done so, to enjoy the queer sort of
middle eastern music and improvised dancing the actor portrayed. Since purchasing
the film, I have enjoyed the humorous parts over and over. That a French boy
could love something so strange all his life,and make it one of the most important
factors in his life, rivited me to the movie. There is deep feeling portrayed that
is touching. The value of the elderly and of true love is a show of values I loved.",1296086400,,563,4.371428571428571
507144,5,6302762898,"(This is edited from my IMDb review) The director (Patrice Leconte) has a gift for helping us see people from other perspectives (e.g., ""The Man on the Train"", and others). And as in that movie, Jean Rochefort is one of the leading characters. And, as there can be no one single meaning to a work of art, so any movie will evoke many. But I strongly disagree with the narrative described in most other reviews of this charming movie, thinking my own makes far more sense.

A boy (perhaps 12 years old?) on the cusp of puberty, enjoys the sensuality of physical closeness to the woman barber who cuts his hair. His father has aspirations for his children and, one evening at supper, he asks this son what he wants to be when he grows up. He mistakes his son's answer, groping toward his awakening sexuality (and wanting to marry a female barber), for a lack of ambition. He disapproves of his son's ambition and over-reacts, chastising him at the supper table, and sends him immediately to his room. There is a hint that then both he and his wife think he's gone too far and may be suffering from the thought that he's been overly punishing.

But instead of being hurt or angry, his son takes further solace in his fantasy, very much as Max did (in different ways) in the classic book, ""Where the Wild Things Are."" The rest of this movie is this son's dream of what his future would be like married to a female hairdresser. As in a dream--as in a 12 year old boy's simplified view of what it means to be a married adult and what an adult world is like--many parts of reality are missing: e.g., it's as if he needs no job, as if love & marriage happen in almost an instant, as if his wife's life revolves only about him and his about her, as if all their adult life took place in his wife's barber shop, and as if his wife would, of course, prefer death to losing him.

The somewhat bizarre little recurring dance which he does underscores the non-reality, the dream-like quality of this major part of the movie. This is a charming movie of the world of a boy who is just coming into puberty, trying to make sense of this new, delightful experience of being close to a woman's body.  That's the meaning to me and this view is so compelling it's hard to believe the director intended any other. And it's also hard for me to understand why reviews by experienced critics (like Roger Ebert) miss what (to me) is such an obviously intended meaning.",1277164800,6,2442,4.407982261640798
507145,5,6302762898,"I have seen this movie more than once, but do not own it. This is one of those movies that, once you have seen it, haunts you. It is that good. The acting is superb.",1254009600,,165,3.742857142857143
507146,4,6302762898,This 1990 gem is about a man who was obsessed with the local hairdresser as a little boy and when he grows up finally gets to act on that desire by wooing the new pretty young hairdresser in town. Director Patrice Leconte is a favorite of mine and this 1990 drama was the first of his that I saw -- Monsieur Hire and Girl On The Bridge would follow but this is the gem that first made an impression. Also just out is Leconte's The Perfume Of Yvonne ($29.95; Severin) which I'm looking forward to watching. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com.,1245369600,,539,4.294117647058823

507148,5,6302762898,"Finally, this excellent LeConte movie comes out on DVD.  Jean Rochefort as Antoine manages to infuse a child's innocence into a man's gaze just as the lovely Anna Galiena mixes a natural sensuality with an unmistakable naivete. Is it a linear story? Well, yes and no.  It centers around the character of Antoine who as a child, falls in love with his local coiffeuse.  His dream is to marry one and as an adult he meets the lovely and lonely Matilde.  To tell more would ruin the tale and it really is a wonderfully layered and brilliant story.",1241222400,4,544,4.520408163265306

507150,4,6302762898,"Being a Patrice Leconte-directed film, you know this is going to be nicely photographed with a lot of Sergio Leone-type facial closeups. I always appreciate that, and especially here when it is the beautiful face of Anna Galiena featured often. Some of the ""portraits"" of her in here would make magnificent paintings.

The story isn't much but it kept my interest in an odd way. The film had some strange scenes and some strange viewpoints on life, although I noticed much of the same secular and superstitious liberalness in many films from France. Unfortunately, that secular viewpoint can lead to tragic endings as is the case in this story which finished in a shocking manner.

However, there is some nice humor in this drama, too, such as the funny dance scenes by Jean Rochefort.

One thing about French films: they don't need a lot of action to keep your interest. They are wonderful storytellers and I usually enjoy their films.",1237334400,,936,4.8375

This movie makes me more aware of the precious moment of life - the moment that will never come back to us. Life is very short as though it is a blink or two, and I easily forget it, but the film reminds me of it so I can utilize my time efficiently as time does not go backward even though it sometimes seems that way.",1134604800,6,438,3.977272727272727
507185,5,6302762898,"I knew of Patrice Leconte through ""Monsieur Hire"" but nothing prepared me for this absolute, mysterious masterpiece.  The thing I loved most about this film was the characters' apparent lack of motivation and the unreality that pervaded every frame of the movie.  Actually, the characters aren't all that mysterious once you realize that they are acting spontaneously, in response to deeply felt emotional promptings,instead of exhibiting the typical calculated responses of Americans, who usually derive their sense of self-worth and their notions of what is desirable from the television world of George Clooney et al. See, Leconte says, you can actually live spontaneously and authentically, even break out into dancing for no apparent reason.  And the fact that life is so capricious, so filled with the tragic and unexpected (the suicide of Mathilde) makes it even more imperative that we live fully in the moment, honoring our truest feelings and deepest desires.

An extension of this was the typically Gallic celebration of ""inappropriate"" love. Rather than extolling the quotidian in matters of the heart, the French (and other Europeans) constantly remind us that there is in fact no quotidian--that love is often an unequal alliance between people of different ages and backgrounds who come together for no discernible reason and fulfill each other according to no defensible plan in the brief time that is theirs.

If this film leaves you scratching your head, it won't fail to amaze you with its beautiful cinematography and hypnotic editing.  The hair-cutting scenes are some of the most sensual in the history of cinema, especially those in which there is no overt sexual tension.

A masterpiece.",1099267200,32,1711,5.268382352941177
507186,4,6302762898,"The French certainly know how to film a sensuous romantic tale without an ounce of vulgarity. This film is a beautiful tribute about a young boy growing up with an obsession for hairdressers. It is often funny, sexy, and even sad but woven together masterfully into a striking film.

Jean Rochefort plays the man who recounts his life story as it pertains to his love affair with women hairdressers. He begins the story developing a crush upon an older robust woman who cuts his hair. As a grown man he falls in love with a beautiful woman who holds a life of mystery but he marries her without question and never seems to see any faults within her. Rochefort represents either a man in complete and blinding love or an obsessive pervert depending on how you look at him. He is tender and loving but also pretty close to stalking material! His best scenes are also his funniest when he dances to Arabic music and tries to mesmerize little boys into getting their haircuts without fussing.

The woman who plays the ""hairdresser"" is Anna Galiena, an absolute beauty who is seductive and troubled. She holds the town's men within her grasp but only loves Rochefort. The love scenes are extremely erotic without any nudity, something only the French are capable of filming it seems. Galiena never reveals her past or why she seems somehow desperately sad. She seems to cover up her emptiness through an anxious obsession with cutting hair and having sex with Rochefort. Her quiet complexities carry the film because the viewers continue to hope for something to be revealed about this private stunning woman.

Although this film is exquisitely beautiful it is also frustrating because the characters never reveal their truths. It is easy to see why Rochefort would be passionate about Galiena but what drives Galiena to be interested in Rochefort? Possibly the filmmakers decided to let the viewers form their own opinions about each character. Regardless it is worth the effort but you may never look at hairdressers quite the same.",1091577600,25,2029,4.858381502890174

This touching film stars veteran French actor Jean Rochefort as Antoine--the hairdresser's husband, and Anna Galiena is Mathilde, the hairdresser ... enough said!
The film portrays life at its finest as well as its most sad times. I found the film a little slow at some points but neccessary to enforce the fact that sometimes life is just peaceful and inactive and at times - rash and quick.",1079654400,6,576,4.77
507188,5,6302762898,"I found this film to be fascinating and touching, especially if you are yourself in the middle of the first three months of a torrid love affair. As a woman, I hope that men are capable of feeling as the protagonist does about his personal fetish-female--I tend to think not, but it's the kind of thing we long for (ok, maybe only some of us long for...others may find it merely weird and incomprehensible). The film definitely touches on many erotic elements that may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the film is so visually charming and almost tactile in its depiction of sex that I think everyone will find something to like in it.
I agree with the other reviewer in that it is a real shame they have never released the soundtrack. It should come as no surprise that the composer for this film, Michael Nyman, also did the music for ""The Piano""--a movie which has a similar sensibility (and both films were directed by women, I believe!)
