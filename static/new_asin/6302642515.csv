7828448,5,6302642515,I recently found a few tapes in my closet and figured eh what the heck why not try em.  So I popped em in and all of a sudden child hood memories flooding back!  This show rocked.  I can't believe there isn't a dvd of it.  I've reminded all my friends of this childhood show they've long forgotten and now they're begging me to lend them my tapes!  I'm gonna buy the ones I don't have.  Too bad there's only 6 volumes and a couple movies on Amazon.,1086566400,7,448,4.034090909090909

Why? I absolutely loved this show as a kid and still love it when disney channel UK can be bothered to rerun it. please please please Michael Eisner and the evil Disney corp. please release a complete Dinosaurs boxset for all dino lovers around the world, would sure beat Brother bear!",1084406400,10,509,4.483870967741935
