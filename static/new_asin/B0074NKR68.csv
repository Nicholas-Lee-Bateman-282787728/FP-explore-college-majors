The cast were a reliable company, the stars, such as Bernard Lee, M in James Bond films of the day, often seen in small roles in big films. I'm going with five stars to encourage the producers to put them out in North America. Most of us can't play PAL. Of course, I am writing as one who grew up in Britain and moved to North America. I noticed a slight mistake, the films are 1960, and the series ran to 1965 I think, not 1956.",1442707200,,602,3.9834710743801653
