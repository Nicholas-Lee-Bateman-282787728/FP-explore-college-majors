8622950,1,B00GGZEVIA,Audio sync is WAY off on this version. Unwatchable.,1528329600,,51,4.777777777777778
8622951,3,B00GGZEVIA,"There are two additional tracks in here that are absent from the Godbluff DVD; ""What would have Robert said?"" and ""Darkness"". However the video and audio quality is noticeably poor in comparison. The Godbluff DVD appears to be an earlier copy and the colors are brighter and there's better contrast. In addition the audio is Dolby 5.1 as opposed to stereo for the Live Broadcasts DVD.",1486339200,,384,4.833333333333333
