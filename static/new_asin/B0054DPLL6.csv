All fans will find this DVD fascinating to watch as a historical presentation of our National Pastime.",1434672000,,246,4.6976744186046515
8456606,5,B0054DPLL6,A well done video of an actual televised baseball game as it happened from those golden days.  The folks in Pittsburgh still remember this game.  The people in New York would like to forget.  Maybe the only game Mickey Mantle admitted to crying after losing.  If you like baseball give this a whirl....you'll see a boatload of hall of famers and a great game.,1421712000,,359,4.5625

8456608,5,B0054DPLL6,"If you're reading this there's a good chance you already know that the 1960 World Series ended abruptly with one of the two most dramatic home runs in baseball history (Bobby Thomson's 1951 N.L. Pennant-winning ""Shot Heard `Round the World"" being the other). Thought to be lost--or nonexistent in the first place--a kinescope of the historic and deciding seventh game was discovered in 2010 in the basement of one of the Pittsburgh Pirates' former owners, the late entertainer Bing Crosby, by the Crosby family's archivist, Robert Bader. Unlike another historic recent discovery, Don Larsen's perfect pitching performance in game 5 of the '56 Series, the complete ""Mazeroski game"" was found in its entirety. The family made the kinescope available to MLB, and it is now, in the 50th anniversary year of the 1960 Series, available on DVD.

The long-available highlight film naturally fell short in capturing the excitement and drama of this epic Game 7 clash between the underdog Pirates and the overpowering Yankees, who were arguably at the peak of their long and storied dynasty. In fact, the Bombers outscored the Pirates 55-27 in the Series, and Game 7 was a high scoring back-and-forth battle royal that alternately seemed hopeless for both teams at various points, something which has become overshadowed by Mazeroski's home run. The formidable outfield arms of Roberto Clemente and Roger Maris figured prominently in this game, as did the baserunning agility of Mickey Mantle, Casey Stengel's predilection for changing pitchers, and a less than perfectly manicured Forbes infield, which famously victimized Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek.

The quality of the kinescope itself is typical of the era--decent, but not exactly the HD level we've become used to in this day and age. But for any baseball fan, the historical value alone makes this set a must-have.",1402704000,2,1863,5.206666666666667
