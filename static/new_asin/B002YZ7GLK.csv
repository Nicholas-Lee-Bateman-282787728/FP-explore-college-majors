4013966,1,B002YZ7GLK,I also cannot open my copy on my Panasonic Blu-Ray Player.  It only seems to be a problem with this particular DVDV.,1303171200,9,116,4.2727272727272725
4013967,1,B002YZ7GLK,"Was unable to view.  I did not see the small print before purchase, indicating some Sony Blu-rays cannot open these DVD.  I have a Sony Blu-Ray, less than 2 years old and it would not open the DVD. Am presently returning it for credit, so I will see if they back up their No hassel return policy.",1293667200,8,296,4.175438596491228
4013968,5,B002YZ7GLK,"It should be noted that amazon.co.uk has this available in region-free blu ray for roughly $40 shipped. Do not get suckered into buying this for twice the price domestically from importers.

Before a discussion of the quality of the writing, acting and cinematography, I will provide a little transfer quality details for the AV junkies out there. The disc itself is PAL encoded but does not suffer from a lot of the issues prevalent in displaying PAL source material on NTSC displays. Its native resolution is 1080i with an oar of 16:9. Having watched season 1 on dvd (which is a reasonable transfer), I highly recommend you spend the extra $20 and opt for the blu ray. The colors (despite some visible banding) are excellent and the added resolution really helps convey the brilliant cinematography in this series. The audio code is DTS HD MA 5.1 and is good, but remember this mystery is more drama than action and lossless audio is nice but far from necessary.

This is the BBC's revival of a hit Swedish detective series starring the venerable Kenneth Branagh as Kurt Wallander, the hard drinking, divorced police detective in coastal Sweden whose determination and keen perception helps him and the local police force solve murders in pastoral Sweden. First and foresmost, it's all in English. It appears to be exclusively filmed in rural Sweden and it does not take long for the viewer to forego the natural disconnect of various British dialects to slowly sink into a believable setting of Southern Sweden. The director certainly uses the natural landscape as a silent character in the progession of the story in capturing either vibrant images or moonlit evenings.

Branagh towers in this show despite a nice mix of largely unrecognizable British actors. He plays the slightly tormented protagonist who drags along enough emotional turmoil with dogged determination and grit that it not only creates audience sympathy, but a true candor with basic humanity. The slightly humble confines of his character - divorced, struggling with an elderly father, and a somewhat distanced realtionship with his daughter - provide the perfect handicap to Branagh's slight tendency for slightly too theatrical approach to drama. That said, his portrayal is the best I have seen on television in a long time and it's an absolute travesty that this has not seen wider showing in the states.

Highly recommended.",1279584000,52,2403,5.045340050377834

4013971,5,B002YZ7GLK,"Wallander is well acted and plotted.  Stories contain depth, emotion and interesting settings.  I recommend the series highly.  ....... .....",1389916800,,141,5.95
4013972,1,B002YZ7GLK,"Kenneth Branagh certainly portrays a convincing Wallander. For an actor his caliber, one would think he would. That aside, it is a very strange experience watching this series, especially after having seen Wallander with Krister Henriksson. The events take place in Ystad, rural Sweden, everyone has Swedish names, e-mails, newspapers and correspondence in the series are in Swedish, yet all the actors are British and speak with British accents. Save yourself the bewilderment and watch the original.",1384732800,2,501,5.51948051948052

4013975,5,B002YZ7GLK,Branagh brings Wallander to life.  I have read most of the Mankell books and Branagh fits like a glove - he is well cast.,1370390400,3,121,4.041666666666667

4013977,2,B002YZ7GLK,"After watching Sherlock and different CSI's, maybe my expectations were too high for the quality of crime solving. Just lacks a lot of protocol to make the stories go more smoothly instead of so dramatic and unrealistic. Plus Wallander is a huge loser in these two seasons so he's not an appealing character to follow. Though the 3rd season he has his act together more so it's not as miserable to watch. Especially considering each episode is an hour and a half long.",1362960000,,468,4.650602409638554
4013978,4,B002YZ7GLK,"I watched the 3 seasons on Netflix. This show is good and the acting well done, but also real dark and brooding and has many graphic scenes of extreme cruelty and evil acts towards humans and animals. There are also many real gross scenes of rotting corpses etc that spring on the screen suddenly, making it real scary and hard to watch at times.
The detective Kurt Wallander is a decent, sensitive and conscientious man, but for some reason is always depressed and seems disgusted with the crimes that his job forces him to deal with. According to the stories, he never done anything to hurt anyone close to him, but in spite of that, his wife left him, his elderly Dad is always on his case and his only daughter is also very critical and distant.
Nothing good ever happens to him and I don't recall he ever cracked a smile in the whole series. Even when he finally gets some good news in the very last episode in season 3, his lips barely turn upwards.",1357171200,5,955,4.401129943502825

8384458,5,B002YZ7GLK,"Just good entertainment, can't vouch for faithfulness to Mankell's written source.
Jeany Spark and David Warner add drama as daughter and father. It's too bad only 12 episodes were made.
The extras are good especially the interviews. The bluray quality is crisp and colorful.",1506643200,,275,5.2727272727272725

8384464,5,B002YZ7GLK,"I love this show.  This poor guy really seems to really get the shaft from people, and doesn't deserve half of it.  He seems so sad because people just won't give him a break.  He portrays his character brilliant.  He's smart and good at his job.  I would love to see something great happen for his character in his personal life.  I look forward to seeing future shows!
