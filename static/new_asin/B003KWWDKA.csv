8399001,5,B003KWWDKA,"I have seen all of the documentaries about Hunter, and I have read, and really enjoyed the book, Gonzo, not so much the documentary, Gonzo.  I had originally held off on buying this because I thought it was a re-enactment and I thought the cover looked cheesy.  It was really good! I'm probably going to buy all the other Last 24 Hours shows about Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, etc.  What t.v. network is this from?  I happened to see the network at my mother's house and an airing of this show about Anna Nicole Smith which wasn't that interesting.  The interview with Thompson's ex-wife was good.  It was very informative, and I was surprised to find that most of the information in this documentary, I didn't know.  It was good.",1376956800,7,732,4.541984732824427

It may be unique in the way it discusses HST's final day, so fans will still probably want to see it.",1358640000,3,244,4.326086956521739
