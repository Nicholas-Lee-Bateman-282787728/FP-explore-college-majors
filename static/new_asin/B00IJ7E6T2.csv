8642502,4,B00IJ7E6T2,"Dad was a teenager during WWII, so it was a time of great importance in his formative years. No surprise there. But we recently spend several days in New Orleans at the WWII museum - a great place to visit, BTW - so I knew this would be something of interest to him.

And it was! He enjoyed having ""his own"" footage from the front, and information from several epic battles from the ETO:  D-Day, Battle of the Bulge, and other critical battles in Europe.

This was for his birthday, and it came on time and in great shape! Would definitely do business with this vendor again!",1511222400,,575,4.355140186915888

8642505,1,B00IJ7E6T2,"An incomplete hack job of several previously released series, including 11 of the 15 ""Big Battles"" episodes, one episode of ""Crusade in the Pacific,"" and the first episode of ""Batteline.""  The original ""Big Battles"" treatment of the ""Battle of France"" is presented in two episodes.  This collection only presents part one, leaving the viewer hanging halfway through the German conquest of France.  Most decisively is not a ""chronicle"" and should not be marketed as such, a real stinker.",1426464000,4,486,5.205128205128205
