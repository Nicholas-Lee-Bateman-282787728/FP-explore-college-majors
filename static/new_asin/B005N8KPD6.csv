4844911,3,B005N8KPD6,"Anna as she said at the wrap party just wasn't cut out for TV and DVD-fitness instructor falls under that category. She didn't count, she doesn't transition well and she certainly doesn't explain the moves at all. Dolvett has promise--wonder if there is a bootcamp for DVD instructors. Don't get me wrong, doing all the sections together gave me a really good workout, but Bob is the highlight. He knows how to motivate the viewers at home and make it so it feels like he is standing over you adjusting your stance.

4844912,5,B005N8KPD6,"Some reviews here don't do this video justice. I respect all reviews, but really Anna not counting down the sets is not a big deal. After doing the workout once you definitely get the rhythm, easy as that. What's much more important in the video for me is that:

1) Anna's and everyone else's circuits are really thought out, they give you the maximum benefit and time goes by quickly.

2) My favorite contestants are there, which is more motivational than you think. I love working out with Ramon and Sunny and the rest of the gang.

3) Dolvet's smile honestly doesn't let you stop and keeps you going until the end of the workout and his warm up and cool down are great.",1324512000,3,672,4.403225806451613
4844913,4,B005N8KPD6,"""Biggest Loser: Calorie Knockout"" contains some basic exercises, good  if you don't want too many fancy moves.  Dumbbells are used on all 3 circuits and it is a beginner, and may be almost an intermediate workout, if you use heavier weights and skip the rest periods which was what I did.

4844914,3,B005N8KPD6,"I haven't really watched Biggest Loser since Jillian left, but I thought I would try this workout because it was suggested to me after I purchased Jillian's Extreme Shed and Shred. The workouts are way too short. 15 minutes just isn't long enough for me to get a good burn. The few episodes of BL that I saw part of Dolvett didn't really bother me, but on this DVD I found him a bit abrasive and annoying. His workout was ok. I honestly can't report on Anna's cause I didn't even bother to try it. Bob's workout is the best by a long shot. I wish the whole dvd was just him.  The workouts felt choppy and disjointed. I didn't like the tabata style workout either. All and all there are much better exercise dvd's out there for less. Unless you like the novelty of working out with the shows contestants I would skip this one.",1323734400,,825,4.288461538461538
4844915,3,B005N8KPD6,"I don't often write reviews of products, but since this workout video is so new I thought I would give my perspective to those who are thinking about purchasing it.  I did the entire video yesterday (a 5 minute warm-up, a 15 minute circuit with Anna, a 15 minute circuit with Bob, a 15 minute circuit with Dolvett, and a 5 minute cooldown).  While I did feel like I got a good workout, there were a few things that frustrated me.

Anna is not a good fit for an instructor in a workout video.  She may be able to get you to work up a sweat, but I found myself more annoyed as time went on during her circuit.  She doesn't count and it's VERY difficult to tell when you are going to transition into the next move.  She make peppy little comments to the others doing the moves (the heavier versions of some of the contestants on this season's Biggest Loser), but it comes across as very fake.  The workout itself is choppy and difficult to follow.  You do work up a good sweat, but if you're expecting a professional, smooth workout, then Anna's circuit is NOT for you.

Bob's workout was by far THE BEST on this DVD.  It was classic Bob.  Very focused on form and giving you a heads-up when you were going to switch to something else.  I enjoyed his circuit the most because it was what I have come to expect from a Bob Harper workout.  A nice, challenging, calorie burning circuit.

I love Dolvett on the BL show, but I was also slightly annoyed by his circuit (but for different reasons).  His 15 minutes consist of something called ""Tabata"" which means you do one exercise for 20 seconds and then rest for 10 seconds, then do another exercise for 20 seconds and recover for 10 seconds (and so on and so on).  Every time he said ""Tabata"" I heard ""cibatta"" (who knows, maybe I was hungry) and I wasn't thrilled with the choices of exercises he gives you to do during the circuit.  There were a LOT of lunge and squat-type moves which are hard for people with bad knees.  The modifiers for those moves don't really produce as much effort so I'm not sure you get the same amount of burn as if you do the full exercise (and in my case, possibly mess up your knees).

The warm-up and cooldown portions of the DVD were nothing outstanding, but I think they were well done.  Again, my biggest complaint with this DVD was Anna and her lack of communication during her circuit.  Knowing when to stop an exercise and when you are switching to something else is very important to me in an at home workout.  I didn't get that from her.

Overall, you do work up a pretty good sweat and I'm sure I burned some calories (although probably not as many as I do in a solitary Jillian Michaels or Bob Harper DVD).  The whole Calorie Knockout workout does go by pretty quickly, though, which is always a bonus.  I'll try this DVD a few more times before deciding whether or not I want to trade it in or keep it in the rotation.",1323561600,43,2907,4.299632352941177
4844916,3,B005N8KPD6,"I have done a lot of workout DVDs, and I have to say, Anna is by far the worst, and I mean WORST, instructor I have ever seen. She doesn't count down so you have no idea how many more of ie. jumping jacks you have to do. She just stops and goes into something new. She also tells you to watch Vinny and someone else for modifications, but she never introduces them in the beginning! You can clearly see who they are eventually, but it's all up to you.

I only did the Circuit #1 with Anna, and even though Anna is TERRIBLE, the workout is pretty good. I did sweat. But since she's terrible, the workout is choppy and the transitions aren't smooth at all. I did like most of the exercises though, but be prepared, she goes quickly into new things without warning.

I'll have to do Circuits #2 and #3 to get a full opinion, but so far, workouts are good, but Anna is bad.",1323561600,4,869,4.136094674556213
4844917,2,B005N8KPD6,"This dvd arrived yesterday along with Jillian Michaels' Extreme Shed & Shred. I bought this one when I went to buy Jillian's title because Amazon had them packaged together. There are three 15 minute workouts on this dvd. The whole program is only 45 minutes for $12.00  All the other titles I have of Jillian's or Bob's provide a lot more bang for your buck. For example: Jillians Ripped in 30 has four 30 minute workokuts.  Jillian's new title Extreme Shed & Shred has two 45 minute workouts for less money and Bob's Cardio Conditioning has a 60 minute workout for less money. As for the content on this DVD the exercises were ok, but nothing I hadn't seen before. I did all three workouts and only burned 300 calories. For 45 minutes I usually average at least 450 cals. 10 cals per minute. I could barely understand Anna when she was talking. Dolvett is handsome, but kind of cheesy. Bob is good, but his stand alone titles are much better. I wouldn't spend money on Biggest Loser titles unless you like to watch the contestants workout.  If you are looking to get yourself in shape I recommend Jillian's new title. Bob's workouts are also good. Even Jackie Warner's stuff is way better.",1323129600,8,1191,4.582159624413146
4844918,3,B005N8KPD6,"While I love Bob I couldn't stand the workouts with Anna and Dolvett. For some reason I find them to be laughable and I just can't take either one of them seriously. There is nothing interesting or new here. If you want Bob I would buy his stand alone titles. They are much better than this DVD. Honestly, I have tried to watch Biggest Loser since they lost Jillian and it falls flat just like this program. I wouldn't spend the money. Try one of Bob's titles or Jillian's titles or even a Zumba workout.",1323129600,7,504,4.315789473684211

4844920,5,B005N8KPD6,I am surprised about the low rating reviews for this workout.  I have over 300 workout dvds and I thought this one was great and it was not boring at all.  I workout about 6 days a week for about an hour and 30 minutes and I could definitely  tell you that this dvd was not easy and obviously if you do not like to exercise you are going to find any workout boring. I do agree that Anna is not a great instructor but over all this workout is great and effective.,1387670400,3,462,3.946236559139785
4844921,5,B005N8KPD6,"This is a great workout for those who are beginners or do not like to workout much. What I loved about it is ""calories burned"" and to knockout those extra pounds or fat. This was the first time I have ever picked up one of their tapes and wondered what the contestants have to do on the show. Where here it is! I loved this one and was able to complete the entire workouts.

Anna is the easiest but she will do those jumping jacks. Ugh. 30 one round and 50 the last round. Not me. Oddly when I was an athlete in high school, these were one of my favorite exercises we had to do when I played volleyball and softball, don't recall doing much when I played basketball.

Bob Harper is the hardest on this DVD. He will make you sweat for sure. Maybe sore too?! If you do modified moves, you will be okay.

Dolvett Quince tabatta is second to hardest, or second to easier, depending on your drive and metabolism, or how you workout. I also can finish it because I am looking at his gorgeous smile and confidence to push through the workout itself. Never slacked on this one.

Warmup and cool down is cool.

I did notice that it says 15 minutes per workout but Anna does 11:30 minutes, the other two 15 minutes and a few seconds over the time. Warm up is 5 minutes but cool down is about the same.

4844922,5,B005N8KPD6,This is a great exercise video.  I broke a sweat. The pacing is not too fast but it still gets your blood pumping.,1385769600,,114,3.9565217391304346
4844923,5,B005N8KPD6,"I have several of the Biggest Loser workout dvds and I love them all, I would recommend Calorie Knockout to a friend!",1383523200,,117,4.363636363636363
4844924,5,B005N8KPD6,"""Calorie Knockout"" is one of the most intense workouts I've ever done. Maybe it was because I did all three circuits on one day one after the other. There is a nice warm up and a cool down. The circuits are intense because of the pace and for most of the time you are using weights. I'd suggest three pound weights as they seemed heavy enough because of the speed of the exercises. You are going to sweat doing these circuits as they are seriously intense. You will be doing lunges, squats, jumping jacks, kicks and boxing moves. I thought all the three instructors were good and I could follow along great. OK maybe I was a little slower but there were few things I had to modify. The only thing I have to complain about is how Bob makes you hold positions for so long. I had to come out of the positions a few times because it was too intense. Anna was cute and Dolvett has a huge beautiful smile. Dolvett communicates with you in a mild drill sergeant-like style which is amusing and makes you work harder than you would. Anyway I think you get your money's worth when you buy this DVD.

4844928,4,B005N8KPD6,"Just did this one for the first time today.  I started with Bob's workout, then Dolvett's then Anna's.

1) Bob's workout was good - standard Bob Harper - that's a plus!

2) Okay, Dolvett.  When I first started doing this segment I was like ""huh???"".  But as I got into it I was sweating up a storm!  I actually really enjoyed this segment.  Intense movement followed by mini-rest breaks.  No floor work - yay!  This is a very different method of working out (and because I read someone else's review regarding ""ciabatta"" I had to laugh each time he used the word ""Tabata"")

3)  Anna.  Sigh.  Is it just me or is she just very unappealing as a trainer?  She looks more like Twiggy than an athlete.  Honestly she does not even look healthy!  The workout itself was just fine but she adds nothing to it.  I would rather see more of Bob or Dolvett.

If you are a fan of Jillian, Bob, Biggest Loser, etc. you won't disappointed in this DVD.  I would say beginner in some parts, intermediate in others.",1363910400,,996,4.373626373626373

4844930,3,B005N8KPD6,"I borrowed this one from the library and have decided that overall it wasn't the right fit for me, but can see where it might be just the ticket for some exercisers.  Here are my pros and cons:

The instructors were all fine, motivating and pushing you to finish your reps.  The exercises were easy to follow and got your heart rate up with simple moves, jumping jacks, leaps squats with weights, lunges, etc.  The segments are short, approx. 15 minutes each, which allow you to customize your routine as a longer or shorter piece.  The exercisers were all on the show.  Sometimes it is refreshing to see real people who look like they need to exercise shown instead of people who already have perfect abs, skinny thighs and the like.  It is also nice to see that they showed variations when the moves were too challenging, which is a great thing, showing that just because you can't do it all you can modify the move and still get a workout and work up to the move.

The cons for me was that it was a routine I felt I would get bored with too easily.  I also felt that occasionally there was some sloppy form with a few exercisers that wasn't corrected and sometimes people were out of synch with the moves.  These are small things, but still a little annoying.

I do exercise daily and thought this might be a lighter day workout for me, but it really did make me sweat when I really powered into the moves, which range from kickboxing to old school squats, etc and yoga moves.

Overall I would say if you are an advanced beginner or intermediate exerciser you could do this.  I would caution those that have knee issues or do not like high impact moves as there are several exercises that may not be for you.",1336003200,2,1711,4.3765822784810124
4844931,4,B005N8KPD6,"I began this workout a few days ago, Bob's circuit workout is the best out of the 4. Anna is almost childlike in her teaching, she doesn't explain the moves and is quick to go into the next movement. I get a good sweat and I feel pretty beat at the end. It's a good beginner DVD.",1335830400,2,279,3.912280701754386

Now I need to start exercising and watching what I eat to be fit.  I feel that for a beginner, this is a good exercise DVD to buy. I like the warm up and cool down versions. Also, there are 3 different exercise sessions. They really get your heart pumping and make you sweat.

I shed more calories (according to my heart rate monitor) on this DVD than I do on some of my P90x videos! It all just depends on what you put into it.  You can make any workout more of a challenge if you push yourself.

4844934,2,B005N8KPD6,"Like other reviewers, I found Anna's segment to be sub-par. She doesn't cue well, is off-beat, and is NOT motivating at all. I was looking forward to this DVD, because kickboxing is usually a fun, fast-paced workout. Unfortunately (even though Bob and Dolvett were OK), I found this workout to be neither--it was boring and not that great of a workout (maybe because I was completley demotivated!). If you like kickboxing, stick with Tae Bo or Turbo Jam; this one just doesn't cut it. For a more intense workout, try Bob's Bootcamp DVD--much more fun and motivating(and a much better workout)",1328918400,,592,4.871287128712871

Luckily, I got it on Netflix instead of actually buying it.  I agree with most reviewers in that Anna is hands down the worst.  She has no charism and is fake.  However, I don't really fault her for that because she has no experience and probably didn't know what she was getting into.  Her ""workout"" was so easy.  Bob's segment, was classic Bob.  It was good and challenging.  However, it was only 15 minutes.  The last workout was terrible.  The instuctor was good and seemed like he knew what he was doing but the routine sucked.  It was so repetative and boring.  Overall, I felt like I didn't get much of a workout.

You would think with a name like that it would actually be a cardio workout, but I was very disappointed to find that it wasn't.  Every workout on it involved weightlifting.  Not just light cardio weights, but actual strength moves.  I alternate cardio and strength training, doing cardio on one day and strength/weight lifting on the next.  I don't mind some cardio on my strength days, but don't like to do strength moves on my cardio days when I let my muscles rest.  I have lots and lots of strength DVD's and not nearly enough cardio DVD'S for my cardio days.  The title of this DVD and the description on the packaging was very misleading.  I would not have purchased it if I had known it was not a true cardio workout.

Walk through it or really concentrate to pump up the intensity.  On days I am feeling sluggish, I at least do a low impact walk through and it really helps.  If I get too exhausted just slow the pace and make it though the circuit.  Each one is about 12 - 15 minutes.  I always warm up ~5 minutes and then do one, two or three.  I have two of these DVD's and one always travels with me.  I can do all the workouts in a hotel room.  I use water bottles or just workout without weights when traveling.  I highly recommend this DVD as it really is a workout that sculpts our entire body even if using a slower pace until ready to move to the next step.  I had huge results in just a couple of weeks at a slower pace, every other day until I got use to it.  I have used for nearly two years now.  Anytime I am feeling ""uncomfortable or fatter"" I rely on this and within a two week period I am back!  I hated having ""bra bulge"", a smaller muffin top - but still a muffin top, back fat and that annoying bulge by my arm pits.  This really, really helps - not to mention the absolute wonder it does for your butt.
