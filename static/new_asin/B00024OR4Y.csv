2062512,3,B00024OR4Y,"I bought this DVD when I bought my first upright bass (at age 52). I needed something to get me off on the right path, to help me build strength, to get my posture corrected, and to get some basic knowledge about the construction and care of the instrument itself.

This DVD provided all of those things I needed quite readily. There is lots of good advice here. After I adjusted my posture, several chronic pains I was having went away.

Mr. Philips makes a nice, easy to understand presentation.

The idiom of music for which he prepares the student is plucked style, folk, bluegrass, country, or gospel bass playing.

So, if you need classical instruction, with a bow, this is not the DVD for you.

It was a good way for me start, even though I have now gone with a real teacher.",1244419200,10,782,4.402777777777778
2062513,5,B00024OR4Y,Both of Todd's DVDs are excellent. It's  less him teaching you a lesson and more a conversation between bass players. He doesn't hold your hand but rather shares his knowledge from years of playing. It is hard to explain but I've bought several upright bass DVDs and these are far and away the most exciting and worth checking out. It would be great to see him continue the series past intermediate.,1205971200,4,399,4.619718309859155
2062514,5,B00024OR4Y,"This DVD was exactly what I was looking for.  He made it very easy to understand all the basics.  It includes holding it properly, posture, tuning, hand positioning and scales.  Great for a beginner!!!!",1174089600,11,202,4.882352941176471
8022112,5,B00024OR4Y,I like this cause he takes it real slow for someone who knows little about string instruments.,1429833600,,94,4.588235294117647

8022115,5,B00024OR4Y,"I found Mr Phillips to be very patient and inforative. The dvd is well worth the time and $.
I would like to have a teacher the well versed and patient!",1385683200,,152,3.935483870967742
8022116,5,B00024OR4Y,"I bought two books, off of Amazon, (the abc's for accoustic bass) they are good books if you want to learn how to read sheet music. I have bee  playing electric bass for 20.+ years, and wanted to try my hand at a doghouse bass (accoustic, double bass, upright). I bought the books ""the abc's for upright bass"", (not the correct title), it has nothing a new bass player has to offer other than how to read music. I learned more from this cd in 15 minutes than what is compiled in the other books. The instructor starts out slow, goes over the basic components of your new guitar, and, also shows the proper fingering/hand position. Good to Go!!",1368057600,,643,4.4033613445378155
8022117,2,B00024OR4Y,"I bought this DVD series (lesson 1&2), hoping that it would help me get off the ground running. I needed something to get me off on the right foot, to help me start playing quickly, to get the correct fingering, and to get some basic knowledge about the instrument itself.
  Sorry to say this isn't the series you want to invest in. While he does address basic techniques, you learn little else. I suggest Marshall Wilborn's series with Murphy Henry is far better. there, you learn the basics, runs and licks. The Murphy will give you room to grow. Don't wast your money here.",1362528000,3,576,4.528846153846154
8022118,5,B00024OR4Y,I always got frustrated and gave up with different video courses in the past. The instructors were usually demonstrating too fast. They also failed to explain how to apply the scales etc. This course rises far above the others! Todd Phillips demonstrates slowly and explains it all in simple terms. His lessons are easy to follow along with and makes sense from beginning to end. Todd starts with the very basics and progresses you along at a very comfortable speed. He also throws in some shortcut methods along the way. The one hour of knowledge given in this course is like no other I've seen before. I'm learning faster than I'd ever expected! If you're planning to learn the upright bass on your own this course is a must own!!!,1334966400,2,733,4.6461538461538465
8022119,5,B00024OR4Y,I am learning with this DVD and so far I'm loving it big time. Everything feels right and I actually feel I'm learning. This motivates me a lot!,1301097600,,144,4.178571428571429
8022120,5,B00024OR4Y,"I own both of Todd Phillips' DVDs, Ed Friedland's DVD, and Rufus Reid's DVD. They all have valuable information, but Todd's are the ones to start with. He assumes that the UPS guy has just delivered the first double bass you ever touched in your life to your front door and that you've just uncrated it. He goes into body position, shoulder, arm and hand positions. Very good introduction to this difficult instrument. He has you playing entirely open strings for a while in order to get good tone from them before you ever stop a string with a finger. He then has you fingering strings with your left hand without playing them with your right hand until you get that feel down. By the end of tape one he's got you playing ones and fives. Fun stuff! No jazz here. No classical here. No bowing at all. Just fun bluegrass stuff. Todd's DVDs are hands down the best way to start if you don't have a teacher.

After you've got both of Todd's DVDs down, THEN go to Ed's jam-packed DVD. Ed goes into a WHOLE lot more technical info, including bowing and jazz, that Todd doesn't touch. Rufus's DVD is much more esoteric and feel oriented than either Todd's or Ed's, and it's great for adding polish to an intermediate or advanced student.

But if you want to learn to do it all the right way, without bad habits that will hinder your development and cause you physical injury, you must get a good, live teacher.",1289347200,2,1404,4.437984496124031
8022121,4,B00024OR4Y,"Its a good instructional DVD and teaches you the proper set up of your bass, hand positioning and technique.
I would recommend it to anyone that wants to start playing upright bass.",1279756800,,181,4.6875
