4089803,4,B0038N9X22,Not sure why all the negative comments on this movie. I found it very entertaining. even as good as the first. the first and second movie had some stuff in it that wasn't really scriptuarlly sound. I cannot go into it without ruining some of the key parts in this movie but it was an enjoyable watch.,1333929600,13,300,4.280701754385965
4089804,5,B0038N9X22,"I can't believe these negative reviews! The very reason I like this follow up video is that the characters are more realistic than other end times videos I have seen, such as leaving out all of the sci-fi silliness that you get with other videos of this nature. The scene with Riley and kraus arguing by the river shows more of the reality of emotions running high and of the very real human response to their situation. Thank you for an excellent second half!",1316563200,10,460,4.488095238095238
4089805,3,B0038N9X22,"Important to watch, but I was expecting to see more about what was going on throughout the world during that time.  What was going on with Israel and the famines and the changes on the earth taking place.",1316476800,,204,4.368421052631579

4089807,5,B0038N9X22,I loved this movie. this was worth my money and time. i liked the truth and the fact that it provoked an interest in Jesus to those who may not know him. worth it and a great reminder to those who may have fallen away. wonderfully fullfilling :),1296864000,,245,4.125

4089868,4,B0038N9X22,"Minor problems are minor-- it's the end of the world and the men are all clean shaven; mostly clean clothes on everyone, new canteen. I do wonder if this was done on purpose to be more appealing to audiences. The major problem is that accepting CHRIST as your savior is never mentioned. A lot of LORD, but no SAVIOR talk. However, I can see this movie interesting someone enough that they seek to find the LORD, and meet CHRIST as their SAVIOR.
Good movie; I had to buy it twice because I wanted to see the end.",1440115200,,511,4.278350515463917

4089924,4,B0038N9X22,This is the second part of the movie about the events after the rapture. Part one dealt more with finding faith and part two deals more with the struggle to keep it. This film also tackles the problem of trying to understand the ways of God. While maintaining the faith when things are not going your way. Many hard lessons concerning the Christian walk are covered in this film and without the sugar coating.,1408665600,4,409,4.54054054054054

4089964,5,B0038N9X22,"I already had the first part, had seen the second part and wanted to own it. This is the best movie I have ever seen portraying the rapture. I loaned it to my neice and she asked for a Bible to take  home.",1361836800,,205,3.7674418604651163
4089965,5,B0038N9X22,"I gave ""The Moment After""--the first movie in this series a four-star rating because of certain defects in the screenplay, such as a lieutenant wearing captain's bars and good but not great acting.  Well, I am pleased to report that these defects were fixed in installment two.  Okay, okay, there was no attempt to call the Tribulation either Tribulation or Great Tribulation, so that became a moot point, but the fellow with the nametag of Fredericks, the guy who was addressed as lieutenant in the original show even though he wore captain's bars, was promoted to colonel, and wore the appropriate birds on his lapels.  So it seems that someone studied up on their paramilitary rank symbols.  Good boys!  (I will say, however that Fredericks still needs to wash his hair and get a haircut...his unkempt hairstyle was unconvincing. Especially since all his subordinates were quite properly groomed.)

But on top of that, this movie was more intense.  Riley and Baker are thrown together in a ""cluster"" (as in ""I am the vine you are the branches"" and these camps are a cluster) out in the desert.  Baker has had his biochip removed (i.e. the Mark) so that he can infiltrate the scared but faithful group of Christians where Riley is hiding out.  Riley, on the other hand, has escaped from prison totally by mischance and finds the cluster of Christians where his girlfriend, now married, is hiding out.  Jacob Krause is also there, thus completing the triangle.  There is more discussion about how someone makes it through the rough times when death stares you in the face every day.  Jacob provides us with a quite intelliigent monologue on the need for doubt, to validate faith.  We also see a bit more mysticism than in the previous film, and addition which I welcomed.  Strangely, it was not overdone, but added in just the right amount to accent the points the movie was trying to make.  We see a number of close calls as Christians interact with the Global Alliance, and we see how God provides. We also see not so close calls as members of the ""cluster"" are Called Home through violence.  It's not all berries and cream in the Tribulation for Christians.

And another factor in the whole gestalt is the fact that though there are lots of Christians who do not take the Mark, there are lots of others who do not take the Mark, in this film, specifically a bunch of militia/gun nuts.  Sometimes the characters in the militia were a little overdone, but they added a second danger vector that made the story deliciously more intense.

And of course, Jacob Krause, played by Brad Heller was once again amazing in his role.  Playing the prophet of God in the End Times must be a tricky job, but Mr. Heller does more than a creditable job. I hope he wins some awards for his portrayal.  He deserves to.

To understand this film, you need to watch the first film, which really isn't that much of a trial even though I rated it four stars.  But when you have finished with the first film, you need to watch this film.  It was fun as well as dramatic, poignant as well as to the point.  Its spiritual message is right on, and this time, fairly well delivered without becoming overbearing.

And to make things just a bit more interesting, toward the very end, two small twists to the plot almost guarantee that sometime soon we will see coming out ""The Moment After 3.""

I'm looking forward to that third installment.",1341705600,9,3414,4.637271214642263
4089966,4,B0038N9X22,"If you like David White, you will like this movie.  It isn't exactly what I thought it was, but David White saved this movie.  The movie isn't like the other movies that depict the Rapture, but it is still an interesting movie.",1336435200,3,227,4.380952380952381
4089967,5,B0038N9X22,"I gave this movie 5 stars, not because it was the best movie ever, but because it was as good as any at interpreting the time around the Rapture. The characters were believable. The situations were realistic.

The Bible talks about a 'snatching away', but it never uses the term ""Rapture"" as far as I know. It also talks about the event happening in the twinkling of an eye, faster than a person can blink, which is not the way this movie represented it. The people in this movie had time to react. They saw and reacted to seeing Jesus before they were taken up to be with Him. That was a bit of creative script writing to make the story more interesting apparently.  Nobody will have time to react. Two will be in a field. One will be gone and one will remain. There won't be time for anyone to look over and smile at their partner in anticipation of what they see before them. They will be gone instantly. They won't have time to reach out to their unsaved loved ones and try to take them with them.

The script does do a good job showing the reaction of the world when huge numbers of people instantly disappear.

Some will say they saw UFOs taking them off.
Some will say the people were taken away because they lack understanding and the world will be better off without them.
Some will, as the theologian who was left, have a new understanding of the scriptures they have studied, but not really believed. Some of those, like the one in this movie, will be saved at that point. Some still won't believe.

The movie handled the mark of the beast, the identification chip, well, with one person refusing to accept it, another receiving it, and the significance of that decision.",1334793600,18,1682,4.43042071197411
