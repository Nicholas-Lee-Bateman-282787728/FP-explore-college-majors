Swing High, Swing Low is based off the original play ""Burlesque"" that ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season. The role that Carole Lombard plays: Barbara Stanwyck originated on Broadway (it brought her to Hollywood).

Note a nice performance by Dorothy Lamour. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his earliest films.

2897922,1,B000TGKWPS,This is a scammed dvd. Recorded on a VHS then transferred to a DVD it is of poor quality. There is only one movie of Lombard with Powell. The movies are classics but whoever is selling this junk needs to be stopped or at least prosecuted for copyright theft from TCM.

2897923,1,B000TGKWPS,"Picture quality is the worst of any DVD I have ever bought, and there is a constant buzzing, or ringing  sound, kinda like film turning on reel, but loudly.  Waste of money, wish I read reviews before I paid for. Oh yeah Powell is only in two of the four, and he was my main reason for buying these.",1395964800,3,299,4.0508474576271185
2897924,3,B000TGKWPS,"It only serves me right for not reading the reviews here and looking at the product description more carefully.

What I expected was something along the lines of the ""Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection"": movies with those two performers in them. But Lombard and Powell are only in one movie together, ""My Man Godfrey,"" which I already had. It was on the strength of that movie that I wanted to see them together in others.

The first movie, ""Made for Each Other,"" has Lombard and James Stewart. It's a fine, schmaltzy film. (Powell isn't in this one.)

The second, ""Nothing Sacred,"" has Lombard and Fredric March. I found this a fun comedy contrasting ""city-and-country"" life from the first part of the 20th century. (Powell isn't in this one.)

The third, ""Life with Father,"" has Powell, Irene Dunne, and Elizabeth Taylor (first screen appearance?). It still wears well as a look at exaggerated gender roles. (Lombard isn't in this one.)

Finally the aforementioned ""My Man Godfrey"" has Powell and Lombard. It's the black-and-white version; my other copy of the film has this version plus the colorized one. I prefer the b&w.

In sum, if you get this collection you're getting four fine films, each with its own strengths (and weaknesses), but you won't be getting Lombard and Powell in every movie. That's why I give this collection only three stars.",1394236800,,1357,4.878260869565217

2897941,3,B000TGKWPS,These four films were all made during the peak years of both Lombard and Powell and are considered to be some of the classic movie of each of them.,1365465600,,147,4.103448275862069
2897942,2,B000TGKWPS,I expected that all four movies would star both Carole Lombard and William Powell. Only one does. I already have copies of two of the movies in the collection. Surely this would disappoint any one who purchased the set,1360454400,6,218,4.615384615384615

2897956,1,B000TGKWPS,"I can't believe I waited 3 months to view this movie set. It it absolutely terrible. All the films are of horrible quality. I honestly can't believe I paid for this set. The movies have bad sound and look as though they were recorded off the tv in the 90's. The picture quality is worse than if it were playing on tv. Blurry, grainy. I wish I could get my money back.

2897959,1,B000TGKWPS,"While all four of these films are classic comedy gems, especially ""My Man Godfrey"" (which is my personal favourite), this set is overwhelmingly lackluster and, as previously stated, unwatchable. The sound and picture quality is horrendous. For boasting that the films have been ""digitally re-mastered"" all four look as though they have been directly ripped from a VHS. The sound quality is crackled and hard to hear at times- despite the DVD cover also boasting that the sound has been ""enhanced"". For the color films ""Nothing Sacred"" and ""Life with Father""- the color is completely washed out to the point that you wish both films was in black and white.

If you are looking for any of these four films by themselves, go elsewhere! This set is not worth the money!",1338076800,15,765,4.8396946564885495
2897960,5,B000TGKWPS,"What a Delight! I purchased this 2 dvd set specifically to get a good print of My Man Godfrey(1936), my favorite screwball comedy starring William Powell and Carole Lombard. The package is part of the POP FLIX franchise. The film received 6 Academy Award nominations.  I was expecting another fair quality print of the film, especially considering the bargain price. I was quite surprised to see a very good print of the film which is a real delight and is especially poignant today considering the financial state of the USA. I watched the classic again last Thursday night on Turner Movie Classics. During his introduction, host Robert Osborne remarked that TCM was showing the film in a new pristine print! The print was excellent! I would rate it a 10. But the print from the dvd was at least an 8, which I was surprisingly delighted to see, especially in view of my past experiences in trying to find a good print. In addition to Godfrey, you also get Nothing Sacred(1937), with Lombard and Frederic March, which is a 5 star classic. Also, you receive Made For Each Other(1939), with Lombard and James Stewart, which is a 3 or 4 star film. To cap it off, you also receive Life With Father(1947), which starred Powell along with Irene Dunne and Elizabeth Taylor, and received 4 Academy Award Nominations. The film is in color and again, I would rate it at about an 8 out of 10. The film is utterly delightful and a real slice of Americana, exploring family life in New York City during the 1880's. I would highly recommend this 2 dvd set. These days, you would be hard pressed to find an equal bargain!! SMRZ!!!",1323734400,6,1615,4.607638888888889

They all seemed like they were VHS to DVD transfers.

Life with Father was okay, but the print used for the recording has several scratches and the occasional vertical line, so I only half watched it, while I was doing something else.

Nothing Sacred was okay, but the sound seemed off and the color wasn't great.

I didn't watch Made for Each Other, as I'd seen it a few weeks ago(on a separate budget release), and didn't particularly care for it. It starts off as a comedy, but ends up being more of a melodrama.

""Life With Father,"" with Powell but not Lombard is second to ""Godfrey"" in this four-movie lineup, and a strong No. 2 it is.  The fourth movie is ""Made for Each Other, with Carole and Jimmy Stewart, both of them my favorites and everybody else's.
