8255354,4,B0014E0PLK,"""Duck Season: Adulthood is a Moving Target"" (Warner Independent Pictures 4032, in that particular so-titled edition also for the U. S. of A. and Canada) is one of the English titles for this film as it has seen release (the other title being ""Mexican Kids"") on DVD of the Spanish-language film, ""Temporada de patos: ser adulto no vale la pena"". The movie is a succulent exercise in whimsy, the sort of uncoordinated, calm craziness of early adolescence in the case of a 14-year old boy left alone at home, with a pal of his own age, whom soon a more knowing girl of 16 joins, the lass being a bit of a flirt. Also participating in the ensuing revels is a 30-something years old slacker with a ""McJob"" delivering pizza, including to the two boys (with whom he ends up passing the day) on this dull Sunday afternoon, off-and-on with and without electrical power for the computer games that they so favour. The title derives from a painting and various duck-like objects that appear as a constant motif in the film.

Amazon-U.S. has several good reviews of this little cinematic charmer, so there is no need here to go into any considerable detail. The film is an exercise in whimsy, its fey charm lying in the depiction of the sweetly unaffected innocence of early puberty, of youth still without responsibility or more advanced sexual awakening, for the three teens, and of the frustrations of ""slackerhood"" for the hapless young man. Its ""R"" rating (for ""restricted"") is rather silly, due only to some mild profanity now and then from boys trying to exhibit how ""cool"" they are and for the deftly cute portrayal of how marijuana (in birthday brownies that the girl makes after a failed cake) affects the foursome's perceptions, pretty innocent stuff in terms of modern film-making!

One definitely should see this film in an edition with English (or other) subtitles, unless the viewer's Spanish is good enough to catch banter, including slang, which the characters deliver often quite offhandedly, otherwise one is likely to miss the sly humour of what makes this low-key movie so endearing. (A particularly suitable DVD edition, for the U. S. of A.'s and for Canada's market which is in Spanish only, i.e. without English subtitles to view along with it, bearing the title and variant subtitle, ""Temporada de patos: a ti tambin te vale pito?"", is available as R.T.C. Videomax Gold DVD-6342.) The film, obviously, is a bit of unpretentious fluff, but it is ingeniously clever, thus well worth watching time and again.",1411948800,,2518,4.8534883720930235
