8462882,4,B00598OA8G,"Good movies all.  Good value.  The pictures are good, sound is good.  No CC though, I didn't really expect them to have it.  Simple packaging of the no frill department.  I will purchase other films from this company.",1479254400,,217,4.605263157894737
8462883,1,B00598OA8G,"Three movies on one side of one DVD is pushing it too much. Some pixalating and not the best picture. If I had known that they were all on one disc I would not have purchased,",1440460800,,175,3.888888888888889
8462884,3,B00598OA8G,"For some  reason dvd's do not restart where they were stopped/ last viewed.  Whenever one stops in middle of movie, on restart DVD commences at main menu or beginning of movie one (Run Silent Run Deep) and one need to fast forward to find the point at which last stopped.
Also disappointed no subtitles are offered - English captioning for people with hearing difficulties.",1436659200,,373,4.8125
8462885,4,B00598OA8G,"Just going to clarify that this is a gift box set that includes the two single-disk sets ""2 Pack Action"" (http://www.amazon.com/633-Squadron-Submarine-Cliff-Robertson/dp/B00598O9PA) and ""3 Pack Action"" (http://www.amazon.com/Play-Dirty-Dogs-Purple-Plain/dp/B005DTZXMI) from MGM; there is nothing in the way of bonus material such as liner booklet or additional content.
The box itself is worth having as a place to store all your envelope-packed DVDs until you get actual cases for them.",1428105600,,487,6.393939393939394

8462888,5,B00598OA8G,"This collection is just like buying the movies on DVD through MGM. TGG has a contract or something through MGM so they can put MGM movies on collections. All movies except ""Beachhead"" are in Widescreen and the picture is really great. There isn't a menu, except the choices for the movies on both disks in which it just takes you to the start of the movie. Overall if you don't already have these films, I would recommend this.",1370476800,,427,4.487179487179487
