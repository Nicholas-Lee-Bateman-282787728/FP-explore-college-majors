5114390,4,B007Y6CQGE,"""I never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve..""  - Blue Like Jazz*

Blue Like Jazz is unconventional and honest.  It is no wonder that Donald Miller's book of non-fiction essays has been garnering so much attention. You may enjoy this film or hate it- personally, I enjoyed it.  Miller's mode of life-sharing and storytelling is open and free-form, much like this film (I very much recommend reading the book first).  It definitely deserves it's PG-13 rating (this is not a film for little kids), but it's rawness is, I think, what endears it so much to viewers.

Book-readers will also enjoy a few tidbits that make more sense when you're familiar with the nonfiction context on which the story is based.  The author himself also makes a cameo appearance! See if you can spot him.. :)

I give it 4/5 stars.

5114391,4,B007Y6CQGE,This film is refeshing and well made.  It tackles religion in a way that makes you think.  You are not fed simple ideas with simple answers.  This is about faith for a lifetime.  Faith that has no easy answers.  Good acting.  Good writing.  Heartfelt and powerful.  Check it out.,1344384000,2,279,4.551020408163265
5114392,5,B007Y6CQGE,"Blue Like Jazz is real.

Not the real you're thinking of, because reality in a movie is different than true reality. This movie is organic and raw. Whether you are a Christian, or were raised a Christian, or are an intellectual, which seventy five percent of Americans consider themselves, this is a must watch.

I wouldn't call myself a fanatic, but this story has a power:
the power to change, the power to aid, and the power of perspective.

Everyone has a story. This is a fun remembrance.",1344384000,,493,4.579545454545454
5114393,4,B007Y6CQGE,"A low-budget independent film by director with only one prior movie, Blue Like Jazz seeks to break every rule for so-called ""Christian"" films and instead exist as a compelling, realistic story about faith. Despite a few not-so-glaring flaws, the 2012 film Blue Like Jazz rings true, is superbly engaging, and has opened several doors for future filmmakers in the process. Based loosely on Donald Miller's 2003 book of the same name, an anecdotal series of reflections on Christian spirituality, the film almost didn't happen due to lack of interest from Christian film producers (fans of the book came to the rescue in a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign). The material contains a portrayal of life on a real college campus, which anyone who has been to college can attest is never G-rated. The lead character Don (Marshall Allman), who takes elements from Donald Miller's personality and story but is mostly non-biographical, moves from a strongly Southern Baptist Texas environment to Reed College, a highly liberal college in Portland, Oregon. His experiences adjusting to the culture shift, as well as increasing disillusionment with his home environment and family, create a crisis of faith that propels much of the film.

The film doesn't seek to give all the answers, and it certainly doesn't. What it does is tell how messy searching out one's identity is, especially our faith identity. For Christians, there are times and situations that really make us doubt, question, and even reject God. There are times and situations that plunge us into a dark night of the soul. Moreover, there are situations within the church that cut us so deep it is hard to recover. I can rattle off a dozen situations easily where the sinful behavior within churches has caused certain individuals to separate themselves from Christianity, either for a time or for good. Because of this, particular moments within the film hit me with a particular sting. In critiquing the actions of some Christians, the film certainly does not glorify the socially liberal environment, either. The character called ""The Pope"" represents all that is good and downright sad about nihilistic hedonism. On the other hand, the character of Penny (Claire Holt) represents all that is seemingly good and hopeful about really living out our faith, though not without her own struggles. Both characters may seem to present, at times, oversimplified archetypes of their chosen lifestyles, and yet both characters are also very recognizable to me in individuals I have known myself.

As films go, Blue Like Jazz is not a masterpiece. The production is a little shaky at times, largely due to the small budget and the fact that this is only Steve Taylor's second time directing a feature film (his first, The Second Chance, also has many commendable traits, though is leagues behind this in most aspects). There is some unnecessary animation early on that is more distracting that propelling to the storyline. Some supporting characters are dying to be fleshed out more than they end up being. However, perhaps the reason we wish to have more information on the characters is that what we do see of them is entirely compelling. Allman, Wellborn, and Holt (among others) give their characters the dedication and heart it takes to make a story about a spiritual journey believable.

At the beginning of the film, Don's estranged father tells him that life is like jazz, which never resolves, but Don notes that his dad was wrong and jazz does resolve. The film resolves, too, though not in all aspects. While Don begins to reconcile with his faith, family, and friendships, we're not sure what will happen from here. This is a part of the journey, the part we see at the present. Like life, we don't see it all now. We see little vignettes of the story, but we'll never have the full picture in this life. Perhaps, in that aspect, Blue Like Jazz is most relatable of all.",1344211200,6,3933,4.974164133738602
5114394,5,B007Y6CQGE,"I'm deeply biased.  I'm one of the over 3,000 people who donated to a kickstarter project to make this film happen.  I'm a fan of the book and of Donald Miller.

But I also expected the movie to be terrible.

Most Christian filmmaking is very representative of our decidedly strange subculture.  Blue Like Jazz is not.  It's obvious that the primary goal here was to make a good film.  To that end it is funny, touching, well shot and well paced.  There's absolutely an indie aesthetic here, but it's appropriate.

This film exceeded my wildest dreams about what a film adaptation of the book could be.",1343001600,19,602,4.60377358490566
5114395,4,B007Y6CQGE,"I'm good at laying my cards on the table, so I will do so right now. I didn't like the book. I generally don't find Donald Miller's writing very compelling, save for Searching for God Knows What. That said, I loved Blue Like Jazz.

Beginning with a surreal (albeit) poorly paced opening of Donald Miller, played with reserve by Marshall Allman, Blue Like Jazz knows exactly where it needs to go. The film starts in Texas, at a fundamentalist church where Miller is content to simply exist without much rigorous thought. After a familial incident, Miller's perfect life is upended and he runs away into the godless Northwest United States to Reed College, where he experiences drinking, drugs, bi-curious girls and social justice. But, he cannot escape his background, or the Deity that seems to follow him.

Blue Like Jazz does not equate itself to being a Christian film. This does not suggest that Christians are not involved or that there is any lack of Christian themes in Blue Like Jazz, but the nature of the film is not sermonizing. Don's encounters with various students, from a dude dressed in a Pope outfit to a girl involved in Christo-centric social justice, showcase the turmoil of a man caught in the whirlpool of messy, post-conservative Christianity in a staunchly secular and hurting world. *For a discussion on ""christian films.""

I'll confess, I found this to be quite accurate in relation to my own spiritual journey. Having a personal conversation about God at midnight with an agnostic dressed as a beer can comes to mind. Blue Like Jazz touches on this sort of almost transcendental interaction, but also the failure of the church. Not in that the church, as a whole, has failed; rather, in the lives of some people pursuing truth, the church is very capable of providing invisible walls to run into. Blue Like Jazz is honest enough to not avoid the walls, but to show that they can be overcome. We see this in pastors, scholars and parents, both in reality and in this film. Blue Like Jazz never harshly condemns, but rather shows the linger effects of blind trust.

The style of the film is reminiscent of Garden State, with abstract shots of astronauts in space and on earth. Director Steve Taylor, through his use of music and tone, manages to create a genuinely idiosyncratic film. However, the biggest fault of the film is the pacing, with the introduction running far too long. Not much in the way of character development, though there are attempts, until Don packs his bags for college. Once that picks up, the pacing picks up, but there are still instances that bring the film to a grinding halt. Like Don and Pope placing a giant condom on the church steeple. Funny. Necessary in regards to a certain character. But it takes far too long to set up and execute.

Blue Like Jazz is a quirky little film that is filled with honest questions and a genuinely humble ending that is as far from an alter call as one can imagine. However, the ending is far more impactful and quiet than I anticipated, leaving me lost in thought for a long time. For a documentary that more actively engages with the idea, check out Lord, Save Us From Your Followers. Its on Netflix instant.

In many ways, the silence and subtle shift of perspective is far more powerful than an alter call. This is where Blue Like Jazz excels. The point of it is not atonement theory or proclaiming systematic theology. This is not Wayne Grudem or Thomas Oden. This isn't even really Rob Bell or Tony Jones. In some ways, I saw a little N.T. Wright in there. However, the point overall seems to be more towards simply living as one ought to live in order for the gospel to bloom. People see the good deeds other do, and they want to know why. The point is living gospel. Helping the poor. Listening to our enemies. Empathizing with other people's failures.

Possible spoiler:

Don's final comments about being ""ashamed of Jesus"" ruffled some Christian's feathers. However, the context is powerful in that Don is confessing to a person who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a powerful man of God. Being ""ashamed"" is actually the most telling sign of a truly repentant heart. Shame and guilt often showcase our fears and our reaction in tune with the Spirit. Allowing God to move in most mysterious ways.

End possible spoiler.

I'm ashamed of Jesus in that I constantly fail to live up to his perfect example. I'm ashamed of my own failure and the failure of those that profess belief in the same God I love. And that is the pinnacle of Blue Like Jazz. It recognizes the failure of humanity in response to the cross, and the example put forth by both king and servant, Jesus.

The gospel reigns in Blue Like Jazz.

5114396,5,B007Y6CQGE,"It's been about seven years now since I first experienced Blue Like Jazz. I picked up the book one morning and read through it all in one day. Don Miller's honest and vulnerable story of a very personal journey of faith resonated with me. It was refreshing.

When I was in college, I wrote a very short concept for a Blue Like Jazz film one day during screenwriting class. Later that same year, I found out that Steve Taylor had beaten me to it.

So when Blue Like Jazz finally made it to the big screen, I wanted to be there for opening weekend. Even if that meant a long road trip from the hills of Arkansas to someplace with skyscrapers.

If you want to read film reviews, there is a diverse selection of them available on your local internets. I'm not a critic, and have neither the ability nor the desire to write a proper film review. I'll leave that to the professionals. What I can tell you is that Blue Like Jazz is probably the most meaningful and important films I've seen in a long time. Because in Blue Like Jazz, I see myself.

From Don's nerdy hairdo and tucked-in polo shirts during his Baptist days to his realization that he's hid his faith because he was ashamed of Jesus, I felt like I was looking in some sort of a retrospective spiritual mirror. It's a story about how someone who had never had much experience outside the Evangelical sub-culture is stripped of all the extraneous trappings of his religion until he is forced to confront his own belief in Jesus and decide whether or not it's worth keeping. It challenges assumptions about how Christianity should be practiced, where we should stand in the ""culture wars"", and what it means to be a follower of Jesus. It shows us the danger of ignoring how we represennt Jesus to our culture. More importantly, it reminds us that Jesus wants us to discard labels - agnostic, liberal, gay, religious - and simply love people as individuals.

I want to take everyone I know to see the film. To my fellow Christians, I'd say ""Look! This is how the `world' sees us. When we act this way, we are misrepresenting Jesus."" To those struggling with doubt, I'd say ""It's ok. See? You're not alone. But doubt does not have to end in disbelief."" And to those who don't know Jesus, I'd say, ""I'm sorry. Like Don, I'm sorry for all the times I've failed to show you Jesus. He's not like me at all.""

If you get a chance, go watch Blue Like Jazz. Let yourself be carried into Don's story. You may find, like me, that it's remarkably similar to your own.

5114397,5,B007Y6CQGE,"The main stream reviewers really didn't know what to make of this movie. Normal ""Christian"" movies are supposed to be right wing morality tales that tug at the heart strings and are family friendly. Edgy ""Christian"" movies are supposed to be filled with lots of sex, or violence, or profanity in order to prove that they are not normal ""Christian"" movies. This film is none of the above. While not skirting sex, violence, or profanity it doesn't use any of these as a tool to prove its street cred. Just like the book which serves as its source material it is somewhat whacky and off beat, filled with quite a few unforced laughs and real life as it follows the essentially true story of a Texas church boy with a messed up family (and maybe a messed up church) trying to fit in at an Oregon college that really puts the ""liberal"" into Liberal Arts.

This movie moves at a nice pace. It is well directed and edited with a solid cast. As for the ""Christian"" part, it may not please the average Evangelical church goer but it could very well sucker punch many a non church goer who thinks they are just watching a gem of a movie that was overlooked by the mainstream machine. I went to the cinema hoping to like this film because I loved the book and because my daughter has a minor role (the Aqua Babe). I was also wondering how in the world they were going to handle certain parts especially the campus confessional. I left extremely satisfied. Aqua Babe was great. The confessional, while quite a departure from the book, was perfect. And this movie could very easily someday become a cult classis.",1338422400,45,1599,4.494845360824742
5114398,5,B007Y6CQGE,"I loved the book and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I saw it twice on my own and encouraged several to see it in theatre. Now that it's being released as a DVD I'll be buying a few copies and spreading it around.

For those who turn a deaf ear to ""The Roman Road"" or the four point presentation of the Gospel, Blue Like Jazz will provide a means to bring people to the Gospel. It's both a funny and truthful movie.",1338163200,8,413,4.098765432098766
5114399,4,B007Y6CQGE,"""Blue Like Jazz"" (2012 release; 106 min.) is a remarkable little movie on many different levels. Marshall Allman plays Don Miller (on whose autobiography the movie is based), a Southern Baptist teenager in Houston. Miller's universe is shaken up when he finds out that his mom is having an affair with the (married) youth minister of his church. At the prodding of his far more liberal-leaning dad, Miller ends up going to Reed College, the liberal arts school in Portland, OR. Talk about a contrast! Miller tries to fit in as best he can, and also meets Penny (played by Claire Holt), to whom he is instantly attracked. Will Miller lose his religion? Will Miller win the girl? To say much more about the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, but I will say this: there are a couple of nice twists towards the end. The campus of Reed College is almost a character in and of itself, and a number of its campus traditions play a prominent role in the story line, including its annual Renn Fayre festival. Apart from that, I thought Claire Holt was quite the eye-opener (her days on ""H2O Just Add Water"" are clearly behind her!).

Apart from the movie itself, it is worth noting that the fact that the movie was even made is almost a miracle, with hoped-for investment money not coming through days before shooting was to begin. Several fans began raising money through the Kickstarter website, and long story short, enough money came through for the movie to be made (all 3000+ contributors are listed in the film credits, by the way, scrolling by very quickly). The movie made its debut just 2 months ago at the SXSW Film Festival and with almost unheard of speed/urgency, only a month later it was in the theatre (where I saw just it the other day).

Last, but certainly not least, the movie features an excellent soundtrack, truly enjoyable. Most notable is the outstanding indie-rock band Menomena (from Portland, incidentally), who have 4 or 5 songs in the movie. Also featured are indie bands like Be Your Own Pet and Cincinnati's Over the Rhine, which contributes ""All I Get For Christmas Is Blue"" in an important Christmas-themed scene, as well as jazz legend John Coltrane (his album ""A Love Supreme"" plays an important role itself in the movie). To be clear: REM's ""Losing My Religion"" is NOT featured in the film, although certainly could have thematically. In all, I found ""Blue Like Jazz"" to be an unexpected, likable, quirky little movie, miles away from your standard Hollywood fare. If that sound like your cup of tea, you will injoy this movie quite a bit.",1337040000,5,2633,4.696969696969697
5114400,3,B007Y6CQGE,"I loved the book. It was a great resource in my personal journey through this crap we call life. It inspired me and some of the views I now hold.
That being said, the movie annoyed me. I know ""Christian"" movies are usually full of terrible acting and cheesy story lines. Miller is such an amazing author, that in surprised at what a let down the movie is. I mean, they had some much to work with!
The acting was fairly decent, and the ending could be classified as slightly heartwarming. But I found this version of Miller to be annoying. The journey was more of him than of God. Some facts were misrepresented.
I'm not saying I love it because it is a Christian movie, I'm saying I liked it because the book meant so much to me. I like that it's not the stereotypical Christian movie where the entire thing is full of people struggling with life, but God instantly turns it around after one dramatic prayer. Instead, it's a real look at the struggles of being a Christian in a world that honestly doesn't like or doesn't understand God. This carries some weight to people who claim to be followers of Christ.
I appreciate those who watched it who don't name themselves as Christians. I read alot of the negative reviews bashing God and Christianity because people had watched it thinking it was simply a non mainstream movie. But some of those comments are offensive, thus adding to the validity of the theme in the book.

5114407,4,B007Y6CQGE,"First off, I have never much cared for Donald Miller's writing, but sometimes the movies are better rendered. This was such a case.

My walk with God was never this internally messy, but I have been surrounded by so many sinners attempting to figure out which way to go. This movie shows that Christians find themselves in the middle of a messy world. Secularists and Fundamentalists act as if they have all the answer while the Gospel meets people. This movie shows there is ""no come to Jesus moment"" and no sage who can bust down all the uncertainties of life. As the old quote says, ""Christianity is just one beggar telling a other where to get bread."" Through humility we'll find a way to confess.

In the end, this was the movie ""God's Not Dead"" supplanted just as the faux Christianity of easy and painless answers often is more bombastic than the Gospel of the Trinity and of Their kingdom. In Letters and Papers from Prison Bonhoeffer states, ""What we shall need is not geniuses, or cynics, or misanthropes, or clever tacticians, but plain, honest, and straightforward men. Will our inward power of resistance be strong enough, and our honesty with ourselves remorseless enough, for us to find our way back to simplicity and straightforwardness?""

5114411,3,B007Y6CQGE,"It's a good movie. The acting is top-notch and the characters and atmosphere of Reed College and Portland, Oregon are very entertaining, especially the character who calls himself the Pope. The main character is trying to escape his fundamentalist Christian background and ends up escaping Christianity altogether, out of embarrassment on many levels: political, historical, personal, wanting to be liked. It's still relevant in a time when many Christians do not know how to assimilate into the dominant secular culture, the permanency of the sexual revolution, and the New Gnosticism. In some ways, the ending is quaint. Mostly, there doesn't seem to be a lot at stake here. The Donald Miller character does not have a lot to lose -- just a few vaguely understood friendships. It's a classic coming-of-age story, but I'm not sure the lessons here are timeless. But it held my interest and there's a lot that Miller raises that is worthy of discussion.

5114446,3,B007Y6CQGE,"Overall, an artistic portrayal of some of the pressures that are causing Christian youth to question their faith as they go to college. Unfortunately, while overall it seems to encourage Christian college students to hear the Good voice within them, and while it makes a case for why open minded accademics should give Christianity a second look, it also seems to use some symbols that are over-the-top, emotionaly disturbing to Christians. For example, a giant condom is shown draped over a cross that is on top of a Catholic church as parisionners are showing up. What's worse is that it has been put there by the main character who is supposed to be a real Christian who is doing a little back sliding.

I expected the movie to contain some good appologetics for Christianity and it did, a little bit, anyway. But it was more of an appology for Christians than an appologetic for Christianity, and I think both are needed. And it was more of an appology to humans than an appology to God, and I think that both are needed.

I would feel good about showing this movie to a non-Christian accademic who is prejudiced against Christianity. The movie does a good job of showing how a college that sees itself as extremely tolerant can be intolerant of Christians and dismiss their ideas without a fair hearing. It also shows a Christian confessing some of the misdeeds of Christians that have misrepresented Christ.

I would not feel good about showing this film in a church as it could too easily be misunderstood by youth and adults alike.

I would feel good about showing this to discerning, mature Christian college students and their parents with a lot of discussion to follow.",1430524800,,1680,4.743150684931507
5114447,4,B007Y6CQGE,"I want to say that this film felt like it made a genuine attempt at understanding a lot of the thoughts and ways of progressives and non-religious. It's not perfect, there were some straw men and cliches, but some characters, for example Lauryn, don't feel like they were written entirely by an outsider. In fact, I even felt a bit of envy that my alma mater wasn't as awesome as the one in the film.

At the end of the day, though, the film's thesis was that religion is intrinsically connected with good works and good feelings, and that nobody would leave a religion if they weren't emotionally damaged. The two options open to the main characters, and everyone, were (a) Christianity, or (b) pained rejection. Ignored were dozens of religions, some with hundreds of sects, each with their own factual claims, each of which can be examined separately and accepted or rejected on the basis of its claims. Ignored were past and present intentions and interpretations of those religions' historical books, which parts were emphasized at the time of writing vs today, which parts were taken literally in the past vs today, and what were the underlying assumptions of the authors of those religions' holy books at the time of writing. If the character had taken any courses in Levant archaeology, human evolution, or Mesopotamian history and prehistory, the questions he would be asking and the answers that he would have been considering would have been entirely different from those posited in the film.

So while this film felt like it was genuinely reaching out culturally, less patronizingly than films like God's Not Dead, it ultimately missed it's mark.",1429142400,,1658,4.917857142857143
5114448,4,B007Y6CQGE,"I wish that I could award it 3.5 stars. I am a huge fan of the book, so naturally I had very much anticipated seeing the movie. Moreover, I hate those people who say ""well the book was so much better than the movie"" because it doesn't tell you anything about the movie, or the book for that matter. No to mention that they are two very different forms of media. However, I can say this, if given the choice of watching the movie or reading the book, I would always pick the book in this instance.

While the movie was well done, this is not exactly the kind of book that can be easily adapted into a movie. The book follows more of a memoir, that is not written in chronological order. The book is a topical discussion about numerous elements of christian spirituality that Miller wrestled with while taking classes at Reed.

The movie, focused much more on the evolution of Miller as a person. Granted the book does this too, but in a slightly different context. The poster for this movie also gives the impression that this is a love story between a guy and girl. When that is entirely untrue. This is a love story about a man and his God.

All of this is quite difficult to explain, and also not worth diving into in an Amazon customer review. All in all, if you have read Blue Like Jazz, then you will enjoy this movie. If you have not read the book, take the time to do so (it's a quick read, and funny too). You will understand and appreciate the book and movie as separate entities if you give them both your attention.",1426636800,6,1526,4.273356401384083

5114450,5,B007Y6CQGE,"I loved this movie.  It is not your traditional take on a ""Christian Movie"" and I'm not sure you would even really classify it as that at all.  It is really just a movie about a young man finding his way.  What struck me most about this story is that the main character doesn't come full circle at the end of his journey.  His faith in the beginning seemed more like a practice or a habit, but his faith in the end felt authentic.  I feel like he was able to see that Christianity isn't about perfection or religion.  It's about loving God and not being ashamed of it.  It's about admitting there are hypocrites and admitting that sometimes you are the hypocrite, but still waking up every day trying to do better and be better.  It's about not sealing yourself off in this small ""Christian"" bubble, but getting out in the world; being open to new people, places, and things outside your comfort zone, while still being true to who you are.  It's about being ok with sometimes having too many questions and not enough answers.

There is no moral dilemma as to whether or not this movie was good or bad or right or wrong...it was real, it was raw, it was a look at life without the filter on; the Walk in real life for many of us.

5114469,4,B007Y6CQGE,"""Blue Like Jazz"" is one of my all time favorite books, and really changed my perspective on a lot of things that I look at in life. The movie, while very different from the book, still contains little bits and pieces that are remnants from the original story. For example, we have similar characters in that the lead character is named after the book's author, Donald Miller. There's also a love interest that was in the book, Penny. Other bits and pieces are segments of Donald Miller's original writing and little quips that are here provided in either in the narration or spoken verbally.

This film is easily the best ""Christian"" film I've ever seen, and I'm delighted that the filmmakers decided to make it completely unlike anything they'd seen before because, after all, the novel was completely unlike anything most believers had read before. It's an honest, heartfelt story about a twentysomething-year-old man trying to figure out his place in the world through his relationship with God, and that's a message that has translated brilliantly into this film. I think that a lot of people can find parallels to their own lives when watching the movie as we see Donald's story unfold and he doubts his faith, makes mistakes, disappoints his friends, and struggles with other various issues. The film also has a terrific side character in that of ""The Pope,"" which I won't get into here, you'll just have to watch. He made me fall deeply in love with the movie even more.

While I do love the film, I can admit it does have its flaws. There's little things here and there that I found issues with, but I will not say exactly what they are as to not spoil anything for those who have not yet sat down to watch the movie. If it weren't for a few of these issues, I could easily have rated it 5/5 stars.",1405468800,,1806,4.588235294117647

5114475,4,B007Y6CQGE,"A surprisingly good movie on the struggles between doubt and faith cast in the debauchery of college campus life. The message may be more about being true to ones self than the importance of whether one is a believer or non believer. The story does not completely sale itself out to either position which seems to make for a more honest and real portrayal of what both the believer and non believer may actually experience in real life.

It takes a high level of trust for the believer (as I am) to watch this movie to it's ending. Since so much of what Hollywood produces today is designed solely for the purpose of bashing Christianity.

5114517,3,B007Y6CQGE,"It is my opinion that everyone must find God (or not find God) in their own way. There is no 'one size fits all.' This is a movie about a young man struggling with his faith.

Here's the scoop. Don Miller is a Southern Baptist in Texas. Mom and dad are divorced. Dad has applied (unbeknownst to Don) to get his son into Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Don figures to go to a Baptist college in Texas. When he finds out his mom is sleeping with their church's married youth adviser he heads for Reed where he enters a whole new world with a whole new set of challenges.

This is a 'coming of age' type flick. Don thinks he's got the world pegged and his path is chosen. Here, though, he's subjected to one of the most liberal and progressive (not to mention wild and crazy) cultures in the country. His beliefs are challenged, he meets a girl who  he likes but who holds him at arms length. He dabbles in drugs and alcohol and struggles to make sense of it all. He's liking this new environment. The Jazz he listens to makes more sense. He feels freer and more alive. I guess that's why I felt cheated at the end. Given everything that's happened to him in the movie, how is it he makes the decision he makes? I simply did not believe it.

There is a lot to like here. You like Don. You like seeing him break away from the narrow-minded, cloistered environment he's grown up in. You like his dad (kind of) because he wants his son to be more worldly. You feel for his mom though she seems to be her own worst enemy. All of these folks and many at the college are notable personalities. Some of the craziness is over (maybe way over) the top, and some of the discussions on religion are decent. The acting, directing, editing and music are as good as they need to be. Where this falters is in its resolve.

You will like this movie more or less depending on you religious views. But it is well worth seeing.",1374883200,,1907,4.242424242424242

The film lost me when the dead beat dad pulled some strings to get his son into Reed College without his son's knowledge.

Made me see grace and following Jesus in new light. While the book is still my favorite, watching this tonight did the unexpected and opened up a few raw places and gave me insight into how I've been complacent, and not accepting, or loving fully. Basically where I've been a jerk. Miller is a fire-starter... I think it's difficult to read or watch his stuff and be stagnant in faith.

When I watched Penny share about her mom's life, and tell Don to be present with his mom, I grew unsettled... Wondering if I have accepted/loved family wholly, or just allowed shame to mask my perception that loving half-heartedly is ok. I mention this because my favorite stories call me to the heroic... To living authentically, for something greater than myself... To listening deeply, kicking my fear and exposing the root of my anxieties, my vows, so I can live fully present in my relationships, faithwalking. This was transformative.

Most Christian movies have a great message but are usually cheesy because of bad acting a steering clear of things that may shock the sheltered Christian. But I love how real this movie is. It shows God's continual pursuit of our hearts even as we run from Him; kind of like the story of Gomer in the book of Hosea. But it is also not so pushy making it a good movie for anyone to see; whether theist, atheist or agnostic.

If you have ever read the book, know that this follows the book VERY loosely. I am a huge fan of Don Miller and have read several of his books and taking that into consideration, I saw many things that did not match up but as you read in ""A Million Miles in a Thousand Years"" you kind of have to veer from the book to create a good story worth watching onscreen.

I took the greatest offense at dragging John Coltrane into this mess in a horribly misguided attempt at validating the ""life is like"" trope. And of all albums-- his ""A Love Supreme"" which is all about resolution. In fact one of the piece's movements is called ""Resolution"" just in case you don't get it.

If you know the book, you might be unsure of how exactly the random and short-storyesque stories might fit into a movie plot.  However, the movie was still enjoyable and full of characters you grow to love.  As with any situation where a book gets turned into a movie, remember the book is better.

My boyfriend who has not read the books and is Jewish, LOVED the movie.  So, don't think that I'm not saying the movie is bad... I guess I just had high expectations.  It's worth owning and definitely makes you think about things.",1348012800,,890,4.319277108433735
5114568,5,B007Y6CQGE,"I confess: I haven't read the book. In fact, I'm ashamed to admit I'd never even heard of it. But I have ordered a copy, and can't wait for it to arrive, though I understand that it's very different from the movie.

I probably wouldn't have heard of the movie either, except that a friend of mine, Justin Welborn, plays one of the main characters (the Pope). So, of course, I had to support him by watching it.

I had read a little bit about the movie before I saw it, but when I watched it, I truly had no expectations ~ yet somehow I was pleasantly surprised.  It's well written, well shot, well thought-out. Also, it's not a ""Christian"" movie in the traditional sense ~ it's not preachy, not a ""sales tool"", and the characters aren't perfect. They're human, and they're flawed. Which makes them more real. There's drinking, drugs, cursing, anger, pregnancy outside of marriage ~ all things that happen in the real world ~ and the world of the church (even if 'the church' chooses to ignore or deny it).

The movie opens as Donald Miller is about to leave home to go to college. A Baptist college. You see, Don is a dyed-in-the-wool Southern Baptist. He's worked in a factory that makes wine cups for communion. He's been the assistant youth pastor. And he's been a good son to his single mother. He puts up with his father, who is an atheist, and who apparently did not help support Don growing up, but now offers him tuition at Reed College in the Pacific Northwest. Don of course refuses, but then finds out his mother is having an affair with the youth pastor. The married youth pastor.

Feeling betrayed, Don goes to Reed, where he encounters all kinds of people ~ and begins to question his own spirituality. In fact, he whole-heartedly rejects the church and its principles, partly to fit in, and partly because of his feelings of betrayal.

The first scenes of the movie, when Don is at church, are painfully accurate. I wasn't sure I'd be able to watch the movie because of my own experiences as a child in a Southern Baptist church. It made me cringe.

But I kept watching, and found the rest of the movie to be a thoughtful, intelligent look at faith and spirituality, and trying to belong. It also has moments of great humor - when Don participates in ""civil disobedience"" for school credit, and he's dressed in an astronaut suit while the rest of the group are dressed as robots.

The characters engaged me ~ from do-gooder Penny to lesbian Lauryn, from the Russian (who I wish we'd seen more of!) to the Pope, who's actually an atheist (played by Justin).

I wasn't terribly thrilled with the animation, and like other reviewers noted, the opening scenes could have been shorter, but the rest of the movie engaged me. It made me think. It made me ponder. It made me look at my own faith.

If you are open-minded, then this movie is definitely for you. As another reviewer said, ""This is not a film made by Christians for Christians. No, this is a film made by Christians that was made for everyone."" Amen.

Most of the time that means a let down right? I was not let down with this film. It was able to incorporate the important part of the book and also become something different all together. It was warming and refreshing movie. As soon as it was over I wanted to see it again. This is one of those movies you find yourself feeling apart of the story.

Blu-ray extras were fun and different. I really enjoyed this as well. I strongly recommend this film for anyone that enjoys a good story.",1347235200,,659,4.314516129032258

5114572,5,B007Y6CQGE,I really enjoyed this movie. It took a great look into the lives of the religious and the challenges of maintaining or strengthening a belief in college. It was a great story of a young man's struggle with his own faith as he looked at how others within his church and faith system seemed to abuse and misuse their what they  believe.

5114574,3,B007Y6CQGE,"This film has a plot loosely based on the book of the same title. The book is a man's less cohesive musings on life as a ""new kind of Christian"" in Portland. The film adds a plot line that isn't in the book, although includes some similar names, places, musings... I would recommend this film to anyone who has read the book. I did appreciate that the film does not end with everyone's conversion!
Portland is where the young go to retire, according to Portlandia. This book/film shows Portland as the place for the young disillusioned Christian to go to make sense of their faith in our times.",1346889600,,594,4.5092592592592595

5114576,5,B007Y6CQGE,After reading 'blue like jazz' and 'a million miles in a thousand years' you understand the complexity of turning a great book into a great movie.

I've watched this movie 3 times now and I assure you it won't be the last.  It has the indie feel sure, but it more than makes up for any quirks with some stellar acting, writing, and a awesome heart on sleeve approach.  I feel like I know the characters, like they might come over to hang out this weekend.  Maybe I'll watch it again this weekend...",1346371200,,482,4.311111111111111
5114578,5,B007Y6CQGE,"Loved this movie! Streamed and watched it twice. You just don't get everything in a lot of movies the first time you watch so while I had 24hrs I watched it again.

The book was a life changer for me. It opened my eyes to my own faith, to the stereotypical faith, and the real faith. The movie, while quite a bit different, hit all the right marks. The ending makes all the ""longish"" type scenes well worth it. My favorite part of the book is the confessional, so I was waiting to see how this worked out in the movie. It was different but tbh just as good.

As real as a real Christian made movie can be...if not one of the best of all time so far! Loved it Donald! Keep it up brother!",1345766400,,686,4.036764705882353
5114579,5,B007Y6CQGE,"A friend of mine had read the book and wanted to watch it so we just finished the film.  After watching the trailer, I wasn't sold but after watching the film I thought it was great.  Most Christian movies are not any that I would recommend to my non-Christian friends.  They would turn it off and walk away after 5 minutes of Christianese.  This movie depicts what so many college kids go through.  Growing up in church my whole life, I went to college and had to decide for myself what I believe.  Needless to say, I didn't go to the extreme that Donald Miller did, but I found God pulling me back in.  I love how the ending sums up what Christianity is all about.",1345593600,,666,4.238095238095238
5114580,1,B007Y6CQGE,"What can I say about this film? It was horrible. As a Christian I find this movie appalling. I say through till the near end and the whole time I was grieved in my spirit by this blasphemy. There are some good Christian movies out there but this was disgusting. Has cursing, blasphemy, adult content, drugs and alcohol.

Instead of watching this trash I could have spent the time spending time with the Lord but I kept thinking to myself ""this filth is gonna turn around"" Well unless that happened in the last 20 minutes.. I just wasted my time.",1345507200,4,545,4.45

5114582,5,B007Y6CQGE,"I thought this film was excellent. I was a little wary because of its Christian background; however, I was pleasantly surprised. The film does not evangelize or preach to its audience like the typical ""Christian"" movie. I wouldn't even necessarily use the term ""Christian"" when describing the film; I would describe it as an independent/indie film.

The story is poignant and I felt that the characters were relatable, particularly in the regards to the self-discovery and development of your identity that occurs when you go to college.

Unlike most of these reviewers, I haven't read the book and I am not a Christian. I did attend undergrad at a Baptist/Christian university in Texas (I am not from Texas or the south), so this premise of questioning your faith is familiar because many of my college friends were from conservative, Christian, Texas families and went through similar experiences after they left home and had to evaluate their beliefs for themselves.

Many reviewers have noted that this film is must for Christians; I would like to say it is a must for people of all faiths. The questions raised in the film do not apply strictly to Christianity because the spiritual quest toward god characterizes many religions and questioning god happens to people of all faiths.

If you're on the fence, give it a shot.",1344988800,,1327,4.937219730941704

5114584,2,B007Y6CQGE,"I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film.",1344902400,3,718,4.6171875

5114586,5,B007Y6CQGE,"Having read the book several years ago I was curious to see the film as it did not seem like a story that would lend itself to film. I was right. Several fictional elements have been added with the real story to make it filmable. The results are nothing short of outstanding. Everyone involved in this project should be proud. The actors were excellent. It looked to be a much bigger budgeted film than it actually was. The quality of this production should not be surprising. Director and co-writer Steve Taylor had quite a career as a performer in the 1980s and 1990s. His videos were played on Mtv which was unheard of for a Christian artist at the time. His music still is cutting edge 20 and 25 years after he recorded it. For a real treat look up Steve's ""Meltdown at Madame Tussad's"" video on Youtube.  Mostly I want to say, if you are not a Christian, you will still enjoy this film as it is a movie about people and you will not be preached at.  If you are a Christian, some of you may be offended at some of the content here but you should be glad they made a film about reality and not the one dimensional Christians that are usually depicted. I hope the team that made this movie will collaborate on another one soon.",1344729600,,1229,4.316017316017316

I even had to apologize to my friend for making him watch it with me. Boring and silly are the best words for it. Characters are neither appealing or interesting.  I felt no connection to any of them. I was drawn to it because of the title, hoping at least for a  soundtrack with some good jazz (wrong!) and the fact that it was 'Christian based'.  The premise of a Baptist kid questioning his faith is a good one, but it ends there.  The required shot taken at the Catholic church was so predictable. The mother?  Come on!!

Blue Like Jazz makes you think, makes you laugh, and succeeds at being great art.  The movie never gets boring and keeps you hooked throughout.  The acting is excellent.  The story is thought provoking.  And, the movie speaks truth. ""There is something beautiful about a billion stars held steady by a God who knows what He is doing.

5114589,5,B007Y6CQGE,"I was asked by one of the producers (who goes to our church) of Blue Like Jazz (BLJ) movie if Element3 Church would sponsor the movie so it could come to Tallahassee. I saw the BLJ movie while I was in Portland with my wife Shannon and my Mum and we walked away thinking it was a great movie which deals with many of the social difficulties follows of Christ experience when they go to college. I also, thought would be a good movie to be used as an introduction to Christianity for those who have a negative view of our faith.

Below is an updated review I posted on my blog about BLJ:

While I was in Portland a few days ago, I took the time to check out Blue Like Jazz. I've never done a movie review before, but since the book was such a Christian subculture hit, I thought I would give it a shot.

BLJ is not your typical Christian movie, it does not try to white wash the messiness of Donald Miller's experience at Reed College, the movie contains; adult content, drug use, and cussing. I would not take my 11 year old son to see it, but it is the first Christian movie that I would be excited to take a non-Christian friend to see.

I believe this movie is produced with excellence, the Christian theme in the story does not seem forced, and it leaves the audience at a place where they could have an honest dialog about faith.

BLJ is not like Fireproof or any other Christian film like that, it is a rough, honest look at the struggles youth have transitioning into Christian adulthood in the real world, viewers will most likely be disappointed with the characters at times, but such is life.

I believe BLJ is a good conversation starter for the church and families to talk about the challenges students face when going into a new culture. I hope to see more movies like this emerge from Christian filmmakers that show Christians are not perfect; just unreasonably loved by God.

I do think BLJ is an amazing opportunity for outreach to those with a negative view of the Christian faith and it is also a great conversation starter for parents and their college bound students. I really think it will be a great thing for Tallahassee and our church.",1344556800,4,2159,4.3825
