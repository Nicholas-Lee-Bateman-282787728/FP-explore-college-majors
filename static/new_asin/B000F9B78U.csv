8119161,5,B000F9B78U,"About 20 years ago, I owned this product on three VHS tapes.  For some seemingly insane reason, I was possessed to sell it off.  Nuts.

Anyway, the production quality of this extensive documentary was wonderful, and I have yet to see it reproduced through any other outing claiming to be a Queen documentary.  All of the band are equally represented through interview footage, studio sessions, and live performances.  Yes, it actually contains Queen music.  In addition, myriad other stars of the day chime in to offer their take on Queen and where the band takes it place in the musical pantheon.

So, it's about time that this amazing set was re-released on Blu-ray (or DVD at the very least).  I suspect (without any solid evidence) that its lack of availability is due to legal difficulties with the ownership rights of the contents.  If such is the case, this is too bad, as many a Queen fan are missing out on an entertaining and informative show.

Please bring back ""The Magic Years""!",1276560000,7,991,4.742690058479532

8119163,1,B000F9B78U,"How this got listed on Amazon I will never know, but ""Queen - Magic Years"" has never been officially or legitimately released on DVD anywhere in the world. It has only ever been issued on VHS and laserdisc. This listing if for a pirated or bootlegged copy and assuming the seller can even produce a copy of it, it will certainly be nothing more than a DVD-R. If you are interested in owning this release (which is excellent), track down the VHS release or, if you are insistent on owning it on a DVD-R, you can find this bootleg elsewhere online for far, far cheaper than $299.99.",1172966400,7,580,4.429906542056075
