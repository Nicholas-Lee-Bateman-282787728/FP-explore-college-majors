7463700,1,B01690GTW2,"The documentary follows the journey of a man with dollar signs in his eyes as he attempts to authenticate a photograph with no provenance because he thinks one of the blurry images in it looks like Billy the Kid. The documentary takes a very one sided approach in an attempt to prove the photos authenticity; leaving out most of the vast majority of experts who do not think the photo is of Billy the Kid (or don't think the case is even close to being proven). One of the major pieces of ""evidence"" was that the photo was supposedly taken at the ranch of John Tunstall, and the filmmakers even claim to have found the location, with the building in the photo still in existence; one problem; the building they claim to be the same one as in the photo wasn't built until the 1930s. Embarrassing that National Geographic would air a show that had the obvious goal of ""proving"" they found a photograph of Billy the Kid whether the evidence showed that or not.",1455062400,7,957,4.474285714285714
8735866,1,B01690GTW2,"I'm sorry I wasted my money. This is just a""story"" about a guy who thinks he is going to get rich trying to prove a picture is of Billy the Kid. The guy doesn't interview any people with real connections to those involved. Surprise, the picture is ultimately found not to be authentic.",1535932800,,285,4.39622641509434
8735867,5,B01690GTW2,Amazing Documentary!! We just received a print  of the tintype.,1499904000,3,63,5.3
8735868,5,B01690GTW2,"Finally, a film presenting evidence that actually depicts Billy the Kid as it should be; not as a ruthless, half-cocked, un-caring killer the movies make millions of dollars on. I began working in a small part with this broad team of investigators 15 years ago to determine just who this man, Billy the Kid, truly was. Fighting both New Mexico and Texas for DNA became a dead-end with both states not wanting to lose their tourism dollars. When tourism is more important than the truth, history is lost to all. A true historian should fight to uncover every seed of truth...regardless of what that truth reveals. Thank you, Mr. Costner, for your presentation and a special thanks to all of the die-hard investigators who refuse to give up!",1485043200,10,739,4.78125

8735871,1,B01690GTW2,"The county land surveys from 1878, the year that this tintype photo was supposedly taken, state the the Tunstall ranch had no buildings on it at that time. It had only an earthen dugout and a tent on the property. The school building was not actually built until the 1890's, long after Billy the Kid had been killed. The photos of that building, taken before it was remodeled in later years, show that it is not the building in the 1878 tintype photo. Even the expert that was hired by the producer of the documentary said that he ""wouldn't swear in a court of law"" that the blurry image on the tintype was Billy the Kid. True West Magazine showed the tintype photo to ten experts, and every one of them stated that it was not an authentic photo of Billy the Kid. Verdict: not an authentic photo. Case closed.",1476057600,8,809,4.4

8735873,5,B01690GTW2,I found the documentary very interesting. It could very well be William H. Bonney.,1472083200,3,82,4.928571428571429
8735874,5,B01690GTW2,"Interesting to follow as long lost tintype of Billy the Kid, Sally Chisum, and the Regulators is discovered and proven authentic.",1466467200,3,129,5.190476190476191
8735875,5,B01690GTW2,Just watched this show on NGCHD and the guy giving the one star should have listened closely to what was said about the house where the photo was taken! At no time did anyone imply that the house there now was the same! Watch it again and listen! Also this guy takes exception to the finder making a profit? Wondering if they wouldn't have done the same thing? $$$$,1463702400,,365,4.304347826086956
