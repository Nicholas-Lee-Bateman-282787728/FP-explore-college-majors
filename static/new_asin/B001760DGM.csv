8264922,5,B001760DGM,Seem my rating on Brad's FlatPick Jam number one for why these DVD's are important.,1277337600,,83,4.6
8264923,3,B001760DGM,"This is the 4th in a series of DVDs featuring Brad Davis playing traditional flatpicking tunes. Each tune is played at 4 different levels: slow speed (120 beats per minute), medium slow (150 bpm) medium fast (210 bpm) and fast (240 bpm). The slow lead version is played once followed by a second round with Brad playing backup for your lead. The next three faster speeds are each played with two different versions (and interspersed backup sections). Note that this is not instructional material, rather a library of play-along tracks. Even the slow versions are interesting variations when compared to typical beginner material for the same tunes, and may be a bit difficult for beginners or low-end intermediate players. Succeeding versions of each tune become more complex with more work up the neck. Having the DVD version videos (as compared to available audio CDs) is invaluable for figuring out some of the more complex fingerings and movements. Brad's playing and style are something special, and I really enjoy play his arrangements.

My major complaint is that the DVD does not come with tab transcriptions, rather you are directed to a website ([...]) to download PDFs of the tablature. Unfortunately, this seems to be an incomplete project and there are no tabs available for the slow versions in Volume 4 (Volume 1 is the only one that seems to be complete) - only one of the medium-slow versions is given for each tune (none for medium fast or fast). The website says ""We're still working on the transcriptions, so keep checking back as we add more tunes,"" but I have been checking back for a year and have seen no new additions - seems more like a forgotten project. Missing tab for the 'beginner' slow versions seems to be a major flaw in the production of otherwise great material. Had all the promised tabs been available, I would have given this five stars instead of three.",1242604800,,1893,4.8246153846153845
