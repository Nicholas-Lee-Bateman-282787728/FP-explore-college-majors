7319781,5,B0112HPSBU,"Odd Squad is my kids and MY favorite show on tv right now. We all look forward to it every day. My kids are constantly asking throughout the day, ""How many more hours til Odd Squad comes on?"" It's educational and they all have learned something from it. It's cute. I can't wait for my dvds to be released! We LOVE IT! My youngest daughter even dressed at 'Miss O' for Halloween and my middle daughter dressed up as an Odd Squad villian she made up.",1457827200,,448,4.22093023255814

7319784,5,B0112HPSBU,My 5 year old son loves this show. It's actually a show I can watch as an adult and still enjoy it. The plots are fun and the characters are loveable.,1449964800,,150,3.870967741935484
7319785,5,B0112HPSBU,"Odd Squad is one of those great educational kids' shows that is as fun for parents as it is for kids.  Kids will love the sleuthing adventures and silliness, hardly realizing they're learning math along the way, and adults will appreciate the dry, tongue-in-cheek humor and occasional pop culture references.  Odd squad is often the go-to choice for my 7 1/2  4 1/2 year-olds, and I'm never sorry when I have time to watch with them.",1448841600,2,433,4.671052631578948
