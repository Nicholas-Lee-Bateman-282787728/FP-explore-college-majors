This is what all DVD concerts should strive to achieve. Perfect harmony.

1888785,5,B00009QG73,"This concert was performed and recorded live at the Hammersmith Apollo Theater in London on October 2, 2001.  It was part of the group's 30 year anniversary tour and featured long time members Brian Ferry (lead vocals & keyboard), Andy Mackay (woodwinds), Phil Manzanera (guitar) and Paul Thompson (drums).  Although the entire concert is terrific, I was most impressed with the first half.  We were treated to long versions of songs that would feature various players with long solos.  Mackay and Mannanera in particular really shine.

The second half of the show features many of the group's most famous hits including ""Avalon"" ""Dance Away"" ""Jealous Guy"" ""Love Is The Drug"" and others in mostly their traditional radio ready form.

Supplementing the band is Lucy Wilkins on keyboard, backup vocals and some killer violin.  Also Sarah Brown handles the key backup vocals, joined in the second half by Yanick Etienne who has an amazing upper range.  Chris Spedding is on second/rhythm guitar, Zev Katz on bass and Colin Good on piano.  Finally, there is Julia Thornton, a stunning blond (yes I know that is not relevant) who handles percussion, keyboards and backup vocals.  It turns out she's actually an accomplished harpist but got this gig thanks to Ferry's sound director, Rhett Davies whose wife who discovered her at a yoga demonstration where she was playing harp.

I will also point out that although this is a DVD not a Blu ray, both the video and the audio are first rate for this medium.  The stagecraft is excellent and the various camera shots are very well done.  The audio features 3 options; Dolby Digital 2.0, 5.0 and DTS 5.0.  I went with the DTS and played it loud.",1373760000,,1685,4.846153846153846

Bad mistake. This blu-ray is total crap. I don't know about the DVD's quality, but this blu-ray is garbage. Bad sound and bad video quality. Also, it is made in Germany (German introduction screens). I thought this was a legitimate blu-ray, not some bootleg-quality disk.

1888793,5,B00009QG73,"Two words describe this concert and DVD: ""the best.""

Here is the final night of the Roxy band's reunion concert in October of 2001 in London. It features nothing but great songs, great musicians and great visuals. This is still the best concert DVD I have ever watched, and I've seen maybe a hundred.

 I have such a high opinion of this DVD because it combines great music with tremendous visuals. If there is a better job of filming an indoor concert, I'd like to see it. The editing, sharp picture, dazzling colors and fun performers/musicians and dancers are a real treat.

The concert features the Roxy Music band's regular performers for many years, meaning Ferry, guitarist Phil Manzanera saxophonist Andy MacKay, pianist Colin Good and drummer Paul Thompson. Added to the mix are guitarist Chris Spedding, and two great-looking and extremely talented female musicians, Julia Thornton (percusssion and keyboards) and Lucy Wilkins (violin and keyboards). Also, a third female addition, Sarah Brown, is great on vocals and I'm sorry she didn't do her solo on ""Jealous Guy,"" as she did on the CD.  Finally, Zev Katz provides solid bass play but is a low-key guy who stays in the background.

In addition to his singing, Ferry shows talent on keyboards, harmonica and even whistling! Each musician is outstanding and given opportunities to show his or her talent. Manzanera has the most guitar work.

The steady beat, thanks in large part to Thompson's strength on drums, and mellow-ish music all make for a unique sound unlike any other I've ever heard. I don't think these guys were as good when they were young but they've honed talents and now excel in the instruments they play. They (the regulars) are all probably in their mid 50s. Combine that with the great camera-work and you have a concert on DVD that is hard to beat. If only they all were filmed this well!",1240012800,8,1874,4.8193146417445485
1888794,5,B00009QG73,Outstanding video. Well constructed with good coverage of all musicians.  The band is packed with talent and they play most of their big hits.  I really didn't know what great talent they had in this bad until I rented this video.  Had to buy it once I saw it.,1238716800,,260,4.26530612244898
1888795,5,B00009QG73,"I'm a huge Ferry and Roxy fan from ""back in the day"" and was almost worried to watch this DVD incase they'd lost their edge.  But no worries on that score!  Fabulous concert -- it took me back to the 70's and 80's. Great talent and Ferry is as gorgeous as ever.  My 20 year old sons also got a kick out of watching it -- it's not just a trip down memory lane for the original fans.  Very cool and well worth the $$ !!",1233187200,3,417,3.813953488372093
1888796,5,B00009QG73,"""Roxy at the Apollo"" makes me remember how stunned the band made me WAY back in 1974, right after ""Country Life"" was released.  These guys acknowledged what the ""Lester Bangs character"" in ""Almost Famous"" said about rock and roll being dead.  So Roxy, in effect, re-invented it!  And I do have to say that I am EVER so grateful that Eno didn't deign to tour with the band in '01 - his ""balding transvestite"" appearance kind of scared me off the band's first 2 albums (althugh the music was fantastic!) NO problem - here, he's replaced by 2 stone-GORGEOUS Ladies, Lucy Wilkins and Julia Thornton, who handle keyboards/violin (no, Eddie Jobson's not along, either) and percussion.  There's a guy, Colin Good, along on the ride too, and he plays ""just"" piano, thus freeing Bryan Ferry to run about the stage and...well, he ain't the greatest ""front man,"" but let's not quibble.  I said ""just,"" when I mentioned Colin Good, because, I swear, it is sort of trite to say ""he lives up to his name.""  Honestly, he sounds like he's ""channelling"" Chopin or Debussy! The original three other (MOST indispensible!) Roxy musicians are here too, Sax player, Andy Mackay, guitarist Phil Manzanera, and even drummer-extraordinare, Paul Thompson, augmented by noted session guitarist, Chris Spedding.  The sound is absolutely LUSH, even though Ferry's not the vocalist he was..""last millineum,"" but the two Lady singers MORE than adequately hide any shortcomings. If you are a Roxy Music fan (a RABID fan, such as I) just ignore the other two Roxy DVD's, and right now, purchase this DVD.  It truly is something to sit down with your kids and enjoy, showing them Rock and Roll's last gasp.

1888798,5,B00009QG73,"Phenomenal performance! Roxy Music has always been a favorite of mine, but I had never seen them live or on DVD. This DVD has some incredible energy, great sound and video. The songs to me sound as good as or, in some cases, better than the original studio recordings. Case in point is my favorite ""Mother of Pearl"". I love the video editing of this song to include a very sexy black and white montage of dancers. The song picked up needed speed over the original. Everyone looks like they're having a great time on all of the tracks. I can't recommend this one enough.",1171497600,5,569,4.428571428571429
1888799,4,B00009QG73,"Not many bands can provide a consistent output of great music for decades, but Roxy has. They have plenty of classic records and many of these catchy pop tunes with tasteful arrangements are captured on this live performance.

The concert is approximately 105 minutes long, has a good selection of tunes (most tempos are faster than the studio versions), good video, and three audio choices (DTS, DD 5.0, and stereo)...  all sound great. In addition, this disc has the option to display the lyrics as subtitles, which is a feature that should be standard for all concert DVD's.

1888800,5,B00009QG73,"This band wrote the book on style and originality, and they gave it to us mixing musical mayhem with finesse and soul. And never once took themselves too seriously doing it.

And now, 30 years later, out of the blue these geezers pop up on a stage and put on a show that puts any contemporary pretender to shame.

30 years later and they are still ahead of their time.",1143244800,9,368,4.242857142857143
1888801,5,B00009QG73,"Well filmed, great show, good extras, and absolutely astounding music.  I can't believe how good they sound.  All of the smiles on stage are nice too.  Looks like everyone is really enjoying themselves.

I don't understand any of the comments I'm reading about Ferry's voice.  Weak?  You don't get it.  Ferry's voice is not a natural voice, he sings like he is an instrument.  Try singing along and you'll see what I mean.  No one sounds like him.  He's still right on after all these years.

Please note that the mix is more a reflection of the way a concert sounds (which is probably a wise choice), this is as opposed to specific channels with locateable instruments in the sound field as some concert DVDs are recorded.  U2s DVD comes to mind as more of a studio mix than a concert - don't get me wrong, I liked that one too, it's just a different sound.",1139443200,9,858,4.42948717948718
1888802,5,B00009QG73,"Thanks to Scott Briggs for writing in and addressing the problem I experienced with the audio on this DVD fading in and out.  He was correct that my receiver set up needed to be changed. Now that the problem has been resolved I have re-written my review and given this spectacular DVD the five star rating it deserves. I am a life long Roxy Music fan and I was lucky enough to catch this tour in Philadelphia so it has special meaning for me. On this tour Roxy went back to their roots, revisiting songs like ""Virginia Plain"" and ""Re-Make Remodel"" with a blistering energy that surprised me when I heard it. As always Brian Ferry plays the quintessential wounded romantic, wooing us with his sultry baritone and seducing us with his quirky, country gentleman appeal. Guitarists Phil Manzanera and Chris Spedding are both brilliant. Their blistering back-to-back solos on ""My Only Love"" provide one of the highlights of the show.  Andy MacKay's haunting horn gives Roxy it's ambient signature sound and drummer Paul Thompson is a monster! All of the musicians on stage do a fantastic job. Lucy Wilkins is able to cover both Brian Eno's screeching synthesizer and Eddie Jobson's searing violin, filling in for two very important original members simultaneously. This DVD captures a very special moment in time that should not be missed.",1110326400,7,1334,4.872246696035242
1888803,3,B00009QG73,"On the good side, this DVD has a good selection of songs, drawing at least one song from each album. There is even a leaning more towards the older material.  The songs are fairly well played and are fairly close to the original versions.  Phil Manzanera and Paul Thompson get high marks for really getting into the concert and seeming excited and showing some youthful spirit.  Another bonus with the DVD is that you have the option of displaying the lyrics/words on the TV as they are being sung.  There is also a video that shows the behind-the-scenes activities leading up to the show.

On the down side, this is showing a sort of fake version of Roxy Music.  Although there are four original members, there are 5 or so other younger members that sort of drown out visions of the classic Roxy lineup.  Ferry does a fairly good job with many of the songs, but kind of lazily drifts through some of the heavier songs (most notably Out of the Blue).  So some of the songs lack the vocal dynamics that made him so interesting in the ""good old days"".

In all fairness, we can't expect the core band musicians - now in their 50's - to be the energetic guys they were in the 1970s (when they were in their 20s).  If you like the later, mellower Roxy albums, you'll probably get into this.  If you long for the stranger early period, check out the MusikLaden video.  That shows them back in the days when they were actually creating these songs.  But nonetheless, Live at the Apollo is still a decent represention of the band, especially of their wide variety of music, from heavy to soft, from pop to weirdness, and everything in between.

Highlights include Both Ends Burning, Re-make Re-model, Out of the Blue, Virginia Plain.",1106611200,8,1725,4.540453074433657
1888804,5,B00009QG73,"Far from being a ""nostalgia"" tour, the show itself was definitely a ""must-see"", esp. the venues they were playing in (mostly theaters).

Fortunately, more Roxy Music footage exists (The High Road's on DVD but somewhat tricky to find, but get it!), Musikladen, and a couple of videos Brian had put out in the 90s that had solo and Roxy, but they really did a great job with this one. Even though he's older and not hitting the notes he did 20 years ago, it's not all that noticable.

Is it going to warrant repeated viewings and listenings? Absolutely. It even has closed captioning.. But I would recommend the live CD from this tour as well, taking tracks from different shows (or recommend for the company to combo package it), as ""If There Is Something"" is on there and not on here and a better version of ""More Than This"".",1103155200,4,825,4.530201342281879
1888805,5,B00009QG73,"Was fortunate enough to see this Roxy Tour in both Tokyo and New York; they were simply amazing, all the more so for the energy - in addition to the expected cool vibe and talent. The cast of musicians and entertainers ran a clinic for all their imitators. I finally got around to playing the DVD I bought eons ago; and got to experience it all over again; the quality of the production is outstanding. Let's hope we see at least one more Roxy CD with new material and one or more grand tours. The Rock and Roll hall of fame should be considered a fraud until Roxy is inducted.",1102636800,5,577,4.254545454545455

1888807,5,B00009QG73,"Responding to someone's earlier review mentioning having the

sound fade in/out during playback, I had the same issue and

realized, playing it on my new PC with DVD drive, that since

I didn't have a 5.1 or 6.1 setup as yet, just a good pair of

Altec Lansing pc speakers, I had to go into the DVD

menu and set the sound for Dolby stereo 2.0 instead of the

5.1 mixes included herein.  Then the sound suddenly became spectacular and stopped fading out. Those with surround systems will probably want to set the sound for the proper surround mix, or you might get similar fade problems.  The credits mention that the great Rhett Davies (who was worked with Roxy Music many times before as producer and engineer) designed the sound mix for this DVD, and he definitely knows what he's doing because in the proper mix, this DVD sounds unbelievable--it has few or none of the problems inherent (normally) in live concerts recorded for video or DVD.  A few times Bryan's vocal mike could've been mixed a bit louder, but otherwise, it's spot-on dynamic. Paul Thompson's drums in particular sound larger-than-life, as if you're sitting right next to his drum kit!

I can only imagine what the 5.1 mixes sound like, I hope

I get to find out soon though.

  As for the DVD itself, I watched this again the other night

in its entirety, and I caught both the 2001 and 2003 NYC

shows on the tour, at Radio City and the MSG Garden Theatre,

and this DVD brings me right back to both of those shows,

as if I'm there again in the audience.  Easily one of the

greatest live concert DVDs or videos I've ever seen.

Most of them suck, but this one delivers the goods and then

goes beyond it to become a truly moving experience.

A band at the top of their form and captured on a dazzling

DVD.  This a must-own if you're any kind of Roxy Music fan.

The DVD also includes some great extras, a mini-pre-tour

warmup documentary with backstage footage and interviews,

and even full lyrics you can set to play on/off during each

song or the entire concert.  Outro/credits music is even

great, utilizing the instrumental song ""India"" from the great Roxy Avalon album (1982).",1094428800,5,2162,4.537662337662337
1888808,5,B00009QG73,"Without rehashing the astute comments of other reviewers, here's what your 20 plus bucks will get you: One of the absolute best (in every way) concerts ever captured on film, bar none!  From the material selected (Ferry said that he had a ""short list of 50 songs"" from which this final list emerged) to the stage set; from the DTS/Dolby surround mix to the camera work; from the audience/band rapport to the incredible musicianship, this has it all.
As good as Roxy Music's studio recordings are, they could never match the live performance, and this DVD is proof positive (compare, for example, the original version of 'Mother of Pearl' to this one).  I caught Bryan Ferry in concert about 10 years ago (with Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and drummer Andy Newmark), and as good as it was, this concert was better.  With four of the original members (including drummer Paul Thompson) augmented by equally talented support musicians Colin Good (piano), Zev Katz (bass), Lucy Wilkins (violin, keyboards and synth) and Julia Thornton (percussion, keyboards and vibraphone), the result is nearly magical.  Flawless musicianship, exhuberant stage dynamics and thrilling versions of great songs make this an almost life-affirming experience. (Good, Katz and Thornton were part of the small orchestral backing group Ferry used in his 'Bryan Ferry in Concert-Live in Paris' release of 2000)
While some may quibble about the song selections (I would like to have seen 'Angel Eyes' included), to see and hear musicians of this calibre whenever the mood strikes (which for me is daily) is something special. It is impossible to recommend this DVD too highly.",1080864000,45,1645,5.104089219330855
1888809,5,B00009QG73,"I'm a roxy fan, but not a fanatic.  I own 4 of their CD's and one of them is a best of, and two of them I've only listened to once.  I own a couple of concert DVD's and wasn't too hip on live music because I always liked the studio cuts better.  What I'm trying to say is I wasn't sure if I would like this DVD...But, never having seen Roxy in person, I wanted to check it out.
Boy was I pleased!  I thought the mixing was excellent for a live cut.  You could hear every one of the little percussion instruments (which have names, and everyone knows what they sound like, but no one knows what they're called)and Roxy uses them all.  I watched it on my cheap Sanyo DVD player and Sanyo 25"" screen and listened through my 12 year old receiver through 900mHz cordless headphones (my girlfriend was sleeping).  You know the hiss they can give you if you use 900MHz cordless phones and still thought the sound was good.  Now maybe I'm a little deaf from too loud of music, or my ears are not trained for discerning great from mediocre sound quality, but I found myself at times with goosebumps and wanting to stand up and cheer.
I can hear Bryan Ferry saying (in the words of Elwood Blues) ""I'm getting the band back together.""  The band members are obviously older, they haven't toured together since 1986 or so, but I get the feeling with no new material, this may be the last time any of us not fortunate enough to see this tour, may ever get to see them.  In my mind, they are one of the most unique sounds of many of our popular music histories that I am so glad I have a copy to enjoy and share with others who ask ""What was Roxy Music like?""",1075593600,6,1644,4.157728706624606
1888810,5,B00009QG73,"I knew and liked a few of their songs, so rather than pick one album ""out of the blue,"" I bought this DVD when I came across it.  I've always found it easier to get into a band by seeing a concert (whether live or recorded), and that was definitely the case here.
I hate to sound like I'm shilling for them, but after watching this DVD thirty times (or more), I went out and bought all of their albums, based on the strength of the performaces here.  And though I love the albums, with several songs I still prefer the more energized live performances here to the original studio recordings -- that's how strong it is.
Technically, the direction's smooth and understated (no tenth-of-a-second MTV quick-cut crap here), the video is saturated and near-perfect in recording quality, and the audio is just gorgeous -- a great, professional-quality live recording that  sounds neither weak or overproduced.
Anyhow, if you're of a similar mind -- you know a few of their songs, and/or you like elegant pop/rock music that pushes the envelope a bit without being pretentious, and/or you're a fan of live music in general -- I'd definitely recommend that you put this DVD on your short list.

1888811,5,B00009QG73,"Roxy Music fans will not be disappointed with this beautifully produced concert DVD.  Frontman Bryan Ferry sounds much better than I expected and the musicianship is superb all around.  Original Drummer Paul Thompson appears with the band for the first time since the early 70's (He seemed to be a real crowd favorite at the Apollo).  The other original band members Manzanera and Mackay sound better than ever. Highlights: guitarist Manzanera's soloing; neoclassical piano intro to ""Song for Europe"" by Colin Good; violin solo by Lucy Wilkins on ""Out of the Blue""; Chris Spedding's hypnotic guitar solo on ""My Only Love""; and my personal favorite, ""Oh Yeah"", in which the entire band really seem to be enjoying themselves.

1888812,5,B00009QG73,"Sometimes you can go home again - and sometimes a reformed rock outfit with no new material to hawk can revisit the past and actually make it sound vital. Roxy's reunion tour was, with no apology, a celebration of their decade-long run, with all the hits (Dance Away, Love is the Drug) and album staples (Mother of Pearl, For Your Pleasure) trotted out for receptive audiences. This DVD not only captures the enthusiasm of Ferry, McKay, Manzanera & Co. for their songbook, but it does so with some of the best audio/visual quality I've ever seen on a concert dvd. The camera work is great, capturing all the band members (this ain't just the Ferry Show) on the job. The band itself sounds thoroughly professional and spirited, and pulsing away at the core of it all is original Roxy drummer Paul Thompson. His presence is a real coup, not just for ""legitimacy"" reasons, but because his locked grooves both breathe on their own and propel the rest of the band forward with elan. Utility players Julia Thornton and Lucy Wilkins flesh out the various textures of everything from Avalon to Out of the Blue; Wilkins even tackles the primitive synths once employed by a certain Eno.
Some highlights: Manzanera's lacerating guitar solo over the menacing groove of While My Heart is Still Beating; the joyous crescendo of Mother of Pearl's second half; the one-by-one exits during the final section of For Your Pleasure. The extra documentary isn't shabby either. Absolutely essential for Roxy fans.",1073520000,4,1491,4.874015748031496
1888813,5,B00009QG73,"Thomas Wolfe and his famous You Can't Go Home Again spring to mind when you think of bands trying to relive their glory years. Roxy Music and this video are an exception. I went to go see them during this tour with a bit of hesitation. While I love the band, the last tour I saw them on for Avalon was not the best; it looked like they were sleep walking through the performances. The video of that performance was pretty bad as well; the quality and the direction were just not up to snuff.
This time they get it right. While Eno's stage presence is missed (he was never much of a musician compared to the others in the band), the musicians fleshing out the original remaining quartet (the amazing Paul Thompson is back on drums in addition to Andy MacKay on sax, Phil Manzanera on guitar and, of course, Bryan Ferry on occasional keyboards, harmonica and lead vocals)do a great job of helping to recreate the band's studio and concert sound. I only saw Roxy one time with Eddie Jobson and can attest that, yes, they were amazing. On the other hand, this line up more than makes up for his absence. Lucy Wilkins manages to recreate Jobson's key moments on electric violin but she also adds touches of her own on Dance Away (not always my fav Roxy song nor the band's as its no challenge to peform in concert).
Unlike the recent CD release (which is also very good), this is all taken from one venue not pieced together from various performances around the world. The result is that the show has more continuity in the performance than the piece meal approach.
The song selection is fairly strong with the focus on the band's singles and strongest album tracks. Sure there are audience favs missing (and some of the song list was drawn from a survey that Phil Manzanera had on his website) but, on the whole, the song selection is very, very good.",1068940800,28,1847,4.4674556213017755

7992703,4,B00009QG73,"Nice video and sonics.  The set list is great.  This is, though, latter day Roxy Music so it doesn't have the Sci Fi edge that the early band had.  Great stuff but no longer dangerous.",1468972800,,184,4.2
7992704,3,B00009QG73,"Extremely disappointing. I finally found a Roxy Music compilation that included almost all my favorite songs. I even listened to a little of it on Youtube before purchasing. Alas, the sound quality is mostly awful, and Bryan Ferry's voice is at about 70% efficiency. 3 stars for an amazing rendition of Song for Europe that is far better tun the original. Also, the sound quality improves for the latter half of the concert.",1448064000,,424,4.821917808219178

7992706,5,B00009QG73,"Absolutely the Best!  Followed Roxy since I was a teenager in the 70's.  Although the rhythm of some of the songs have changed in this video.  They remained the best band ever and if you know who they are then you them.  If you don't know who they are you still know their music.  They are the band that you wondered, ""Who wrote that?""",1400371200,,335,4.171875
7992707,1,B00009QG73,"this is just horrible
a great concert but picture and sound quality don't even reach vhs this is worse than a bootleg. amazon shouldn't sell this rubbish. it's a absolute rip off DON'T BUY this",1381708800,4,193,4.542857142857143
7992708,1,B00009QG73,How can one possibly advertise this quality under blu ray. Visually it's absolutely appalling. I have to throw my copy in the trash bin as I would darn feel guilty to even listed for .99c on eBay. I can dribble on the poor quality of this all day but I won't because there is one positive in all of this and that's one less lousy copy of this so called blu ray to dwell on the market. Shame.....,1381017600,3,395,4.076923076923077
7992709,5,B00009QG73,"There was no album to promote. This tour was put together (by the piano player) simply for the love of the music of this great band. With a fine selection of tunes & a terrific group of extra musicians (the violin solo on ""Out Of The Blue"" is spot-on), the performance is wonderful. If I have a complaint at all it's that I had to buy a used copy (but it was in excellent condition). Be cautious of the dvd/cd combo-the dvd is in PAL format & won't play in NTSC players (though the cd works fine). THIS is a show to share with the entire family; Grandparents will like the dance quality of songs, youngsters will enjoy the spectacle of a classy rock show,  newcomers will recognize some of it (THIS was by THESE guys?) & the fans will be happy to have a definitive concert of this fine band.",1379721600,,791,4.23841059602649
