3003911,5,B000XJD3JS,"Emergency! was one of my favorite shows as a kid.  And as far as television shows go, this was a classic.  It's still good and stands up to the test of time, something a lot of shows haven't done.  Rediscovering it in a motel room one night on TVLand made me decide to pursue my childhood dream of being a fireman.",1196121600,12,314,4.114754098360656
3003912,4,B000XJD3JS,"...or anyone who did not see the series in its original airings.

Season 4 shows a team that has been together for several years, and are comfortable in their characters. It also, for the most part, avoids the gimmicks and forced humor that signaled the coming end of the series.

What's missing from all of the Emergency sets is disappointing -- interviews with surviving cast members and tributes to those who have passed on.",1194912000,4,427,4.756756756756757

3004065,5,B000XJD3JS,"Did Emergency season 4 meet my expectations? Oh, yes. I watched the show during it's first run in the 1970's and in syndication around the early 80's. It was always a favorite, and the quality of the discs I found to be quite good. The adventures of the paramedics of Squad 51, and the other firefighters of Station 51, the humor and the good natured battles between John Gage and Fireman Chet Kelly are fun and moments of levity in a very stressful environment. Add to this the fine Emergency Medical Team at Rampart Hospital consisting of Dr.'s Brackett, Early and Morton, and Head Nurse Dixie McCall, and the dedication towards saving a human life working closely with the fine paramedics Gage and Desoto. Episodes like Gossip featuring Yvonne Craig(Batgirl) as a woman who discovers her husband is a bigamist, and the damage that can be done by idle gossip after people are led to believe Dr. Morton is having financial problems. I give this 5 even without the Special Features which are lacking, because it was such a great show. Enjoying it!",1453852800,,1047,4.726775956284153

This show packs a punch  with excitement. An amazing show that I learned a lot from, and I looked at my father's profession with a different aspect.

3004270,4,B000XJD3JS,"Rush to the scene of danger with all 22 episodes of this 1974-75 Season of EMERGENCY in a collectible 5-disc set. This gripping series that ran on NBC from 1972-77 follows L.A. County Fire Dept. paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and John Gage (Randy Mantooth), Nurse Dixie McCall (Julia London), Dr. Kelly Brackett(Bob Fuller), and Dr. Joe Early(Bobby Troup)along with the help of the heroic staff of Rampart General Hospital in Los Angeles as they make life-and-death decisions and respond to LA's most dire emergency calls. The TV show that broke new ground for all action series to come is more enthralling than ever on DVD!

You have to consider EMERGENCY a great show if it can convincingly combine both medical drama and nail-biting action rescues. The writers, creators, special effects artists and stuntmen on this show went to great ends to think up convincing accidents and then depict them for entertainment purposes. Throw in 2 likeable guys in the form of Kevin Tighe and Randy Mantooth along with a station of cut-ups and you have a hit series on your hands.

A lot of tongue in cheek humor made this series for me as Gage was always trying to get rich quick or fellow fireman Chet Kelly(Tim Donnelly) letting loose with the practical jokes, but yet it was all played straight to save others as we the viewers learned at least superficially the ins and outs of the paramedic business. Kudos to a well remembered and well liked show.

I used to watch EMERGENCY in reruns on ME-TV and TV Land along with ADAM-12 and DRAGNET, which are now on COZI-TV.

By the way, Warner Bros. will finally be releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1660,4.713793103448276

3004277,1,B000XJD3JS,"I've been an E fan since age 14,my interest in the series was re kindled when TV Land ran the series from 1999-2001,and like many die hard fans of the show I couldn't wait til this series was released on DVD. I owned a few of the Columbia House Tapes and recorded several episodes when it ran on TV Land.

When season one was released I was enamored to see such a great transfer,and Universal appeared to clean up the film as the entire season was relatively grain free til I watched season two's episode The Heavyweight,a favorite among E fans,the sound and transfer was pitiful,and seemed Universal was more concerned about making a quick buck than pleasing it's fans.

Season four is the worst of all,while viewing episode 10 Camera Bug,I thought,it can't be!,these shysters [Universal] are using a video source,and can see the tape roll when Kelly Bracket was delivering a baby while dining with Dix in a restaurant. I thought how cheap can you get? The sound was barely audible,and the picture was washed out. Seasons 2-5 need to be re done,I mean if you don't mind bootlegs,you''ll love these,and think Universal copied these from such a source.

3004317,2,B000XJD3JS,"Emergency, like Adam 12 was a landmark series - inspiring many to get into the fire and paramedic service.  It's a brilliant show-and although it's content is a bit dated, it's still a great program.  It's one I grew up with as a kid and loved dearly.
The content of Season 4 contains some of my favorite episodes-the key one being ""Parade"" the continuation of John & Roy rebuilding their 1930's fire engine.  Having already watched through seasons 1 through 3, 1 & 2, the quality was quite decent for an early 70's TV series.  Admittedly, the sound quality did vary from episode to episode-the overall picture quality was very good.
Season 3 began to slip - seeing some weak syndicated prints added into the mix. There weren't many, but there should have been none.

Getting to Season 4. It appears to be entirely poor quality syndicated prints.  The films have scratches, splices, skips, the picture jitters and the colors are pale.  Audio also suffers: some episodes are very muted-so much so it's difficult to hear the underscore music. Others you can actually hear the click of the sprockets in the projector(it's faint, but it's there).  It's like watching these on a grade school film projector!
Shame on Universal for offering up this great show in such poor quality-and with no bonus material(Like the animated Cartoon series-Emergency+4.  Again the 2 stars is only because of the poor quality, not because of the program itself-which is great!",1355356800,,1453,4.873983739837398

3004326,4,B000XJD3JS,"I just finished watching season 4 of Emergency! and while I think the set contains the best episodes/rescue scenes yet, the quality of the transfer is borderline unacceptable!

I can deal with the picture quality having minor glitches, skips, and the like, but the sound quality in this collection is just awful.  The first few episodes are so bad that it sounds like the actors are talking into pillows.  At times, it is very difficult to tell what exactly they are saying and turning up the volume doesn't help the problem much.

The audio quality did seem to improve as the season went on, however, it could be that I simply got used to it.  The day after finishing Emergency!, I began watching Adam-12 (season 5) and actually had to turn the television set to HALF THE VOLUME BECAUSE IT WAS SO LOUD AND CLEAR!

Buy it, but just know what you are getting.

Dixie McCall was such a professional nurse. Always there for her patients. This show actually inspired me to go back to school and become an ED nurse and Paramedic. I loved the basis for the show and really appreciated how each episode had a message delivered without resorting to violence, sex or foul language. While EMS is not for everyone, this show really had something everyone could relate to. It not only delt with the professional lives, but the 'personal' lives of the characters as well. You felt like you were part of the shift each episode. And the patients had 'real' day to day situations which could happen to any of us.

3004332,5,B000XJD3JS,"EMERGENCY! has it all: edge-of-your-seat suspense, hold-your-breath danger, heart-pounding action, tear-jerking pathos, real-life heroism, thought-provoking social issues, admirable and lovable main characters, zany and understated comedy, heartwarming family scenes, unpredictable animals, entertaining mysteries, even a little romance here & there.  Gotta love it!
  Like any show, it has its share of lame episodes that leave you wondering why they were ever released.  This season, though, ends with one so lame it's hilarious- don't miss it!  We laughed so hard- couldn't believe this was even made by the same people who made the rest of the series!  It's reminiscent of old LASSIE shows, highlighting (in poorly-done photography that didn't blend into the rest of the video) lots of different animals to appeal to kids.  It also features an indignant young blonde and later a tearful little girl whose melodramatic acting just cracked us up.  The animal scenes (escaping from the fire) are just plain goofy- our favorite part was where it shows horses and you hear cows mooing, then shows cows and you hear horses.  The part where the hospital docs are trying to save a baby goat should have been thrilling and suspenseful, but they tried for ""heartwarming"" and it had to be the slowest scene on any show ever, punctuated mainly by Dr. Brackett's famous eyebrow expressions.  My husband, who hadn't seen the show on TV in the 70's, was afraid that this was the final episode of EMERGENCY! and that it was introducing some new series featuring the Animal Control forces (some of the worst acting ever!), since Squad 51 vanished for most of the show.  He was greatly relieved when I told him there were seasons 5 and 6 and the 2-hour movie ""season 7"" still in store.",1235347200,,1771,5.051546391752577

I watched it back in 1978.  I video taped a lot of my favorite ones when they were showing the series on our Channel 51 because they showed the scenes that TVLand didn't when TVLand showed it.

I was hooked on John Gage and more.

Thought Chet was funny at times on the show.  But loved the rescues and more.

I am really wondering when Season 5 will be out now.  So many episodes have not seen in a long time that were not ones I taped but the DVD's are nice to replace the video tape recordings did have.

But last couple years been right on cue for January release.  I alwasy start thinking about this as a Christmas present Idea.

It always made me feel like I could share a part of my Dad's work life because he was very quiet, at least around me, about the things that happened at work.  As an adult, with a sister who is now in the department, watching this show is kinda funny because of how advanced we have become.  (No longer are there separate ambulances that come to transport the patient to the hospital.)  The scenery/costuming, etc. is also neat to me because it is so 70's.  The fx are cheesy because, again as an adult, I can tell it's not real, but to my eyes as a child, it was as real as could be.  The actors, specifically Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe, have great chemistry and worked well together.  Keeping in mind that the show was set in the era of sex, drugs and rock n'roll, it's a really good show.  Has some comedy and lots of drama/action.

I have to agree with the other viewers that Season four is not as good in DVD production as the first three seasons. I found three or four episodes which appear to have jerkiness, missing several frames, or show old film artifacts - common to all TV shows and movies when they have been in storage too long. The other three seasons does not have any of these defects. On the plus side, season four is the best yet. I found myself laughing at the dialogue between Chet and Johnny, Dr. Early's hiccups being cured by a boy's suggestion of drinking soda, and the action sequences are more realistic including a falling power line and a woman sitting in a cactus patch.

The acting and writing are specially loose and realistic, which is odd considering the show was from Jack Webb, perhaps the stiffest actor ever. You really believe that Johnny, Roy, Chet, Marco and the Captain are real fire fighters. And of course, the other guy, Mike Stoker actually was one. But the chemistry is great.

I think this season focused a lot more on the paramedics as opposed to the hospital part of the show, but honestly, they are more entertaining anyway. Julie London is also starting to show her age, or at least hints of it. But she still looks fabulous for 50 years old.

That said, the DVDs are not so hot. Universal is well, almost universally awful when it comes to their old TV shows. It's almost a miracle if you get them all, but there's always something to complain about. This time around it's the video and sound quality.

The video looks like they hooked up a film projector and simply recorded it with a camcorder, much like pirated movies on the internet. The sound suffers from being both too loud (the sirens) and too soft (the dialogue), requiring constant fiddling with the remote on the volume.

I work in TV and am as much of a stickler as anyone about quality, but I also know how masters can get misplaced or destroyed requiring you to fall back on a syndicated version.  So I don't get upset about the quality, I mean, come on, this is a TV series from thirty years ago during a time when long-term consideration of these programs was not really considered.  Do you think that thirty years ago the film vault techs thought that people would be buying high-quality sets of the current TV shows at all?  I'm sure that the highest preservation went to feature films.  Until recently, TV shows have been kind of considered ""throw-away"" projects, certainly not something that would end up in libraries of the consumer.  So I give them a pass and will continue to gobble up the rest of the series as they release it.

I grew up on a single episode of Emergency! - well, actually the movie ""The Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" - taped by my mom where she took out the commercials and anything that wasn't a fire truck driving or a rescue happening.  I caught it some on TV Land but the effort involved in taping the shows became overwhelming.  About a year ago I finally broke down and bought the first DVD - and that was all it took.  I didn't realize what a great show this really was.  I find it fascinating from a historical standpoint, but also am impressed at how well-done it is.

I don't want to harp too badly because I don't want to talk them out of release subsequent seasons, but season four has the worst picture and sound out of all releases so far. At the very least, they should have spent some time on cleaning up the sound, especially the inconsistent sound levels within episodes.

The show is great and worth watching even with the disappointing sound and video. Yes, I like the show enough to settle for a crappy picture. My son (3 years old) does not care at all. Whenever I come home from work, he is always begging me to watch ""fire truck show."" As it was my dad who was a firefighter and introduced me to the show at around the same age, it is hard to refuse.

3004375,3,B000XJD3JS,"My review of ""Emergency!"" Season 4 leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I was anticipating ""more of the same"" from the previous releases.

Season 3 upset me some in that included syndication prints.
My heart sank on the opening menu of season 4, with the poor quality audible of the ""Emergency!"" theme.

Not only are these syndication prints, there's no original master print to the entire ""E!S-4"" collection. What a shame for a great season. This is probably my favorite ""Emergency"" season, containing many note worthy episodes.

What's good about this release; it's a step above cable TV and VCR.
Though not all bad, my recommendation lies in Season 3, with more quality prints on the DVD's, better sound and presentation.

Universal really blew the enjoyment of this show for me.
Whoever cleared the release either had a deadline or didn't consider the fan base. I'm going on record at this moment; ""Universal, find the original prints to make a decent collection"".

Both Chet and Marco are given storyline, and the characters of all players become more rounded. This is no doubt ""Emergency!"" at its best, with budget, guest stars (Mark Spitz, John Ashton {Beverly Hills Cop, I & II} Reb Brown {Captain America, Uncommon Valor} in minor guest starring roles), and bigger explosions.

It's fun watching our heroes getting out of tight spots over and over, and from what I recall to be the best dramatic sequence using the defibrillator in ""Smoke Eater"". Although the patient in that episode passes on, it also spoke volumes in real life situations, that not everything has a happy ending, and also marks the shows realism and charm. (it also has, for me, one of the funniest goofs; Chet asks Marco for the salt and gets passed the ketchup, which gets used like it was the salt)

The best ""Emergency!"" series explosion also lies within the last segment of ""The Mouse"" episode.

I could go on marking more favorites, but find it in my heart to recommend this only for the die-hard fans, like me. The print quality is just too poor, (cropped, chopped and scratched, audio at times uneven and inaudible), and will dissapoint the majority of viewers.

These ""E!S-4"" DVD's need Emergency! treatment....I will end any further ""Emergency!"" Season puchases until I get some quality transfers from Universal.",1201824000,9,2295,4.894329896907217

3004377,3,B000XJD3JS,"I agree with the most recent reviews - this is a fantastic show, and season 4 contains many of the best episodes, but Universal's treatment of the DVD releases continues to be horrendous. I got used to seeing the sharp colors & good sound quality on previous releases (with the exception of the few on the Season 3 set that obviously didn't come from good masters & had the wrong opening credits tacked on) so this was a huge disappointment. Emergency! seemed to have escaped the awful treatment Universal gave to the sole Adam-12 & Dragnet releases, but that is obviously no longer the case. Also from reading the episode summary on the cases, it is obvious the writer of those didn't bother to watch any of the episode (eg: summary for ""Details"": ""The line between business & pleasure blurs when a stripper collapses in a nightclub & later does her best to entice Gage.""  .... uh, no - he dated a woman involved in an accident, & the stripper that collapsed didn't try to entice anyone except some mild flirtation with Dr. Early at Rampart. This is just one of the many errors of this type).
So buy the DVD set - it's not that expensive & it's better than watching tapes of the hacked-to-bits TV Land version, but as one reviewer has already said, the Columbia House tapes are far better quality than this disappointing release.
Shame on Universal. The ironic thing is, that if they released quality sets of the Webb shows, we fans would be willing to pay quite a lot for such a product, but they refuse to do so.",1201737600,7,1515,4.509090909090909

 While I am less picky than most reviewers about DVD quality (I have a small television with a so-so picture anyway, so I don't fret about less than perfect images), the picture quality on this set is amazingly bad even on my 13 inch tv -- jittery images, blurriness -- at one point you get about 3 seconds of white scratches across the screen. The sound quality too is less than ideal; as another reviewer noted, the dialogue is often barely audible, so you turn up the sound, and are then blasted out of your chair by the sirens!

Which is so much more the pity, because the episodes themselves are wonderful.  The writers have finally found just the right balance of humor and drama,(""Miss...?"" ""October."") characterizations have settled in and become more three dimensional, the acting is improved over earlier seasons, and production values are excellent.

While it's hard to complain about the price, why oh why can't they take just a LITTLE time to clean up the master tapes before releasing them on DVD?",1201737600,25,1153,4.632352941176471
3004379,1,B000XJD3JS,"After Universal's botched release of Emergency! - Season 3, I began to wonder what would be the worst case scenario for the release of Season 4.  After one year almost to the day, I went back and read my own review for Season 3, I still stand by it.  The common complaint of reviews for Season 3 was basically ""Great Television Show / Terrible DVD Release.""  Some of the shows on the Season 3 DVD release appeared as they did on TV Land with dust particles on the film, sound pops, blurred color and a mono soundtrack that sounded as though it was a fifth or sixth generation copy.  I understand this was also a common complaint with other Jack Webb productions by Universal (Dragnet, Adam-12, etc.)  Not to knock TV Land.  As I pointed out in my Season 3 review, I always appreciated TV Land for bringing the show back on the air after a nearly 15 year hiatus.  But I always noticed the TV Land airings of Emergency! had the same Season 6 opening, were cut by 5 minutes for each episode for commercials and the picture and sound quality were noticeably lacking.

However, some of the episodes on the Season 3 DVD release had transferred over intact from the original restoration from the Columbia House VHS release.  Those episodes both look and sound excellent.  They demonstrate what Emergency! can look and sound like when restored to its full potential.

When I thought about the worst case scenario for Season 4, what came to mind was that all of the episodes of Season 4 would have that low quality ""TV Land look.""  Well guess what friends, that's exactly what happened.  Every episode on the Season 4 release with the exception of the episode ""905-WILD,"" is TV Land sound and quality.  Ironically, ""905-WILD"" was an episode which featured actors Mark Harmon and Albert Popwell as the main characters, not Roy and Johnny.  This episode was intended as somewhat of a pilot for a series that never got off the ground.  Not even the episodes that were restored in the Columbia House VHS release made it to this release.  They look just as bad as the others.  The impact for me was not that shocking at all, I was pretty much expecting it.  This is a five star show with a one star release on DVD.  I'm expecting Seasons 5, 6 and the 6 Emergency! TV movies to be all pretty much the same low quality.  I just know they'll be TV Land versions of what I already have recorded on videocassette.  That's not much to look forward to.  I've given up waiting for Universal to do the right thing.  Universal's key goal appears to be making the highest profit with the lowest quality product.

I give one star for the extra 5 minutes on each episode that was cut for time on the TV Land airings.  To give any more than that, would be giving to Universal more credit than it deserves.  It looks like I'll be hanging onto my Columbia House VHS Emergency! episodes for awhile.  Indeed, the total worth of those videocassettes just shot up to an almost priceless level.  Thanks Columbia House for preserving the integrity of these episodes that this television show deserves.  No thanks to Universal. They continue to demonstrate their descent by putting profit over quality as they continue to relieve themselves on Jack Webb's memory.",1201737600,8,3226,4.5794066317626525
3004380,4,B000XJD3JS,"I am a huge fan of Emergency and would, to this day, drop everything for a date with Randolph Mantooth! I have all four seasons so far.

Extra being about $1500 a week.). And I can't wait for them to start releasing the Emergency movies.

My only complaint with Season 4 is the sound quality. I did not notice this problem in the earlier seasons but with Season 4 the sound seems all over the place. I watched about 6 shows (from several of the DVDs) with the volume high enough that I could hear the dialogue but when the sirens go off (either as they head to a call or from the call to the hospital), the siren sound is so bad (both in decibels and quality) that I have to turn down the volume about 8 or 10 notches. Plus there are a few other places in the DVD where the normal volume is too low and I have to turn it up 8 or 10 notches to hear the dialogue. If overall, the sound was low requiring you to turn up the volume, that is one thing. But to have the sound differ so much means I have to keep the volume remote in my hand at all times else my neighbors might think there are real fire trucks and such nearby!

But all that has been addressed apparently, as Season 4 is the best in quality so far. I think Universal has recognized the following this show has and perhaps put more care in presenting it. Just a guess, I don't know for sure.

This set is a must for any Emergency! fan. The episodes are great and the actors had really settled into their roles and made their characters their own.

For those not familiar with Emergency!, overall this is a wholesome family show with good morals to it, which is what makes it so endearing in my opinion. You can watch it with young children and not have to worry about them seeing something that is inappropriate for them. Thankfully it stayed that way through all its seasons.

Watching the 21 episodes of this ground breaking series for the first time, I realized why I do not appreciate the graphic medical effects of todays' productions.  The real stars of the show are not the special effects team, but rather Gage, DeSoto, Nurse McCall, and their developed skills. That is the way a show should be.

Build a following based on good scripts, a good cast, and competent set design.  Season Four is perhaps the most polished of the series, with all cast members comfortable and adjusted to each others' idiosyncracies.

Sit down, plug it in, and get ready for 'Rampart 51'!

3004385,5,B000XJD3JS,"By its fourth season Emergency had really settled into a groove.  The stories were exciting and action packed, and the writers and actors had the characters nailed.  Sure, Gage & DeSoto's fellow firefighters were fairly one dimensional characters - but they were FUN one dimensional characters, and the focus of the show was really Gage, DeSoto, Dr. Brackett, Dr. Early, Nurse McCall, and Dr. Morton anyway.

The realism presented on the show by this point had become expected, and the technical jargon was actually fairly well known and understood by the fans.  Emergency was a driving force behind the education of America on the procedures and perils of being a firefighter or paramedic, and it gave a glimpse into what doctors and nurses really did in a hospital.

The fact that Emergency was as successful as it was paved the way for later TV shows like E.R. and movies like Backdraft.

The previous DVD set (Season 3) was a hit or miss affair.  Good episodes, some looking good on the DVD, some just OK, but several episodes had the wrong theme song and opening credits. It was the same opening credit sequence used for the TV Land showings, which had always been a bone of contention with some fans (the original theme song was one of the best in TV history, and to have it replaced was foolish).  Hopefully for this set Universal gets it right.  (Update: Well, I've watched several episodes, and they all have the wrong opening theme.)

Even with the minor quibbles about past DVD sets, Emergency is a MUST HAVE TV show on DVD, and Season 4 is no different.",1199836800,27,1565,4.678832116788321

With the release of the 4th season, my son and i will have something to wathc together.  he loves all those old shows that have to deal with fire, ems and rescue.

Season 4 shows a team that has been together for several years, and are comfortable in their characters. It also, for the most part, avoids the gimmicks and forced humor that signaled the coming end of the series.

It was always a favorite, and the quality of the discs I found to be quite good. The adventures of the paramedics of Squad 51, and the other firefighters of Station 51, the humor and the good natured battles between John Gage and Fireman Chet Kelly are fun and moments of levity in a very stressful environment. Add to this the fine Emergency Medical Team at Rampart Hospital consisting of Dr.'s Brackett, Early and Morton, and Head Nurse Dixie McCall, and the dedication towards saving a human life working closely with the fine paramedics Gage and Desoto. Episodes like Gossip featuring Yvonne Craig(Batgirl) as a woman who discovers her husband is a bigamist, and the damage that can be done by idle gossip after people are led to believe Dr. Morton is having financial problems. I give this 5 even without the Special Features which are lacking, because it was such a great show. Enjoying it!",1453852800,,1047,4.726775956284153

3238767,4,B000XJD3JS,"Rush to the scene of danger with all 22 episodes of this 1974-75 Season of EMERGENCY in a collectible 5-disc set. This gripping series that ran on NBC from 1972-77 follows L.A. County Fire Dept. paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and John Gage (Randy Mantooth), Nurse Dixie McCall (Julia London), Dr. Kelly Brackett(Bob Fuller), and Dr. Joe Early(Bobby Troup)along with the help of the heroic staff of Rampart General Hospital in Los Angeles as they make life-and-death decisions and respond to LA's most dire emergency calls. The TV show that broke new ground for all action series to come is more enthralling than ever on DVD!

You have to consider EMERGENCY a great show if it can convincingly combine both medical drama and nail-biting action rescues. The writers, creators, special effects artists and stuntmen on this show went to great ends to think up convincing accidents and then depict them for entertainment purposes. Throw in 2 likeable guys in the form of Kevin Tighe and Randy Mantooth along with a station of cut-ups and you have a hit series on your hands.

A lot of tongue in cheek humor made this series for me as Gage was always trying to get rich quick or fellow fireman Chet Kelly(Tim Donnelly) letting loose with the practical jokes, but yet it was all played straight to save others as we the viewers learned at least superficially the ins and outs of the paramedic business. Kudos to a well remembered and well liked show.

I used to watch EMERGENCY in reruns on ME-TV and TV Land along with ADAM-12 and DRAGNET, which are now on COZI-TV.

By the way, Warner Bros. will finally be releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1660,4.713793103448276

3238774,1,B000XJD3JS,"I've been an E fan since age 14,my interest in the series was re kindled when TV Land ran the series from 1999-2001,and like many die hard fans of the show I couldn't wait til this series was released on DVD. I owned a few of the Columbia House Tapes and recorded several episodes when it ran on TV Land.

When season one was released I was enamored to see such a great transfer,and Universal appeared to clean up the film as the entire season was relatively grain free til I watched season two's episode The Heavyweight,a favorite among E fans,the sound and transfer was pitiful,and seemed Universal was more concerned about making a quick buck than pleasing it's fans.

Season four is the worst of all,while viewing episode 10 Camera Bug,I thought,it can't be!,these shysters [Universal] are using a video source,and can see the tape roll when Kelly Bracket was delivering a baby while dining with Dix in a restaurant. I thought how cheap can you get? The sound was barely audible,and the picture was washed out. Seasons 2-5 need to be re done,I mean if you don't mind bootlegs,you''ll love these,and think Universal copied these from such a source.

Shame on Universal for passing off this bathetic bathwater onto fans and charging a whopping price to boot. I hope they''ll have the dignity to re master these correctly",1381708800,,1322,4.739130434782608

3238814,2,B000XJD3JS,"Emergency, like Adam 12 was a landmark series - inspiring many to get into the fire and paramedic service.  It's a brilliant show-and although it's content is a bit dated, it's still a great program.  It's one I grew up with as a kid and loved dearly.
The content of Season 4 contains some of my favorite episodes-the key one being ""Parade"" the continuation of John & Roy rebuilding their 1930's fire engine.  Having already watched through seasons 1 through 3, 1 & 2, the quality was quite decent for an early 70's TV series.  Admittedly, the sound quality did vary from episode to episode-the overall picture quality was very good.
Season 3 began to slip - seeing some weak syndicated prints added into the mix. There weren't many, but there should have been none.

Getting to Season 4. It appears to be entirely poor quality syndicated prints.  The films have scratches, splices, skips, the picture jitters and the colors are pale.  Audio also suffers: some episodes are very muted-so much so it's difficult to hear the underscore music. Others you can actually hear the click of the sprockets in the projector(it's faint, but it's there).  It's like watching these on a grade school film projector!
Shame on Universal for offering up this great show in such poor quality-and with no bonus material(Like the animated Cartoon series-Emergency+4.  Again the 2 stars is only because of the poor quality, not because of the program itself-which is great!",1355356800,,1453,4.873983739837398

3238823,4,B000XJD3JS,"I just finished watching season 4 of Emergency! and while I think the set contains the best episodes/rescue scenes yet, the quality of the transfer is borderline unacceptable!

I can deal with the picture quality having minor glitches, skips, and the like, but the sound quality in this collection is just awful.  The first few episodes are so bad that it sounds like the actors are talking into pillows.  At times, it is very difficult to tell what exactly they are saying and turning up the volume doesn't help the problem much.

The audio quality did seem to improve as the season went on, however, it could be that I simply got used to it.  The day after finishing Emergency!, I began watching Adam-12 (season 5) and actually had to turn the television set to HALF THE VOLUME BECAUSE IT WAS SO LOUD AND CLEAR!

Buy it, but just know what you are getting.

Dixie McCall was such a professional nurse. Always there for her patients. This show actually inspired me to go back to school and become an ED nurse and Paramedic. I loved the basis for the show and really appreciated how each episode had a message delivered without resorting to violence, sex or foul language. While EMS is not for everyone, this show really had something everyone could relate to. It not only delt with the professional lives, but the 'personal' lives of the characters as well. You felt like you were part of the shift each episode. And the patients had 'real' day to day situations which could happen to any of us.

3238829,5,B000XJD3JS,"EMERGENCY! has it all: edge-of-your-seat suspense, hold-your-breath danger, heart-pounding action, tear-jerking pathos, real-life heroism, thought-provoking social issues, admirable and lovable main characters, zany and understated comedy, heartwarming family scenes, unpredictable animals, entertaining mysteries, even a little romance here & there.  Gotta love it!
  Like any show, it has its share of lame episodes that leave you wondering why they were ever released.  This season, though, ends with one so lame it's hilarious- don't miss it!  We laughed so hard- couldn't believe this was even made by the same people who made the rest of the series!  It's reminiscent of old LASSIE shows, highlighting (in poorly-done photography that didn't blend into the rest of the video) lots of different animals to appeal to kids.  It also features an indignant young blonde and later a tearful little girl whose melodramatic acting just cracked us up.  The animal scenes (escaping from the fire) are just plain goofy- our favorite part was where it shows horses and you hear cows mooing, then shows cows and you hear horses.  The part where the hospital docs are trying to save a baby goat should have been thrilling and suspenseful, but they tried for ""heartwarming"" and it had to be the slowest scene on any show ever, punctuated mainly by Dr. Brackett's famous eyebrow expressions.  My husband, who hadn't seen the show on TV in the 70's, was afraid that this was the final episode of EMERGENCY! and that it was introducing some new series featuring the Animal Control forces (some of the worst acting ever!), since Squad 51 vanished for most of the show.  He was greatly relieved when I told him there were seasons 5 and 6 and the 2-hour movie ""season 7"" still in store.",1235347200,,1771,5.051546391752577

I watched it back in 1978.  I video taped a lot of my favorite ones when they were showing the series on our Channel 51 because they showed the scenes that TVLand didn't when TVLand showed it.

I was hooked on John Gage and more.

Thought Chet was funny at times on the show.  But loved the rescues and more.

I am really wondering when Season 5 will be out now.  So many episodes have not seen in a long time that were not ones I taped but the DVD's are nice to replace the video tape recordings did have.

But last couple years been right on cue for January release.  I alwasy start thinking about this as a Christmas present Idea.

It always made me feel like I could share a part of my Dad's work life because he was very quiet, at least around me, about the things that happened at work.  As an adult, with a sister who is now in the department, watching this show is kinda funny because of how advanced we have become.  (No longer are there separate ambulances that come to transport the patient to the hospital.)  The scenery/costuming, etc. is also neat to me because it is so 70's.  The fx are cheesy because, again as an adult, I can tell it's not real, but to my eyes as a child, it was as real as could be.  The actors, specifically Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe, have great chemistry and worked well together.

I found three or four episodes which appear to have jerkiness, missing several frames, or show old film artifacts - common to all TV shows and movies when they have been in storage too long. The other three seasons does not have any of these defects. On the plus side, season four is the best yet. I found myself laughing at the dialogue between Chet and Johnny, Dr. Early's hiccups being cured by a boy's suggestion of drinking soda, and the action sequences are more realistic including a falling power line and a woman sitting in a cactus patch.

The acting and writing are specially loose and realistic, which is odd considering the show was from Jack Webb, perhaps the stiffest actor ever. You really believe that Johnny, Roy, Chet, Marco and the Captain are real fire fighters. And of course, the other guy, Mike Stoker actually was one. But the chemistry is great.

I think this season focused a lot more on the paramedics as opposed to the hospital part of the show, but honestly, they are more entertaining anyway. Julie London is also starting to show her age, or at least hints of it. But she still looks fabulous for 50 years old.

That said, the DVDs are not so hot. Universal is well, almost universally awful when it comes to their old TV shows. It's almost a miracle if you get them all, but there's always something to complain about. This time around it's the video and sound quality.

The video looks like they hooked up a film projector and simply recorded it with a camcorder, much like pirated movies on the internet. The sound suffers from being both too loud (the sirens) and too soft (the dialogue), requiring constant fiddling with the remote on the volume.

I work in TV and am as much of a stickler as anyone about quality, but I also know how masters can get misplaced or destroyed requiring you to fall back on a syndicated version.  So I don't get upset about the quality, I mean, come on, this is a TV series from thirty years ago during a time when long-term consideration of these programs was not really considered.  Do you think that thirty years ago the film vault techs thought that people would be buying high-quality sets of the current TV shows at all?  I'm sure that the highest preservation went to feature films.  Until recently, TV shows have been kind of considered ""throw-away"" projects, certainly not something that would end up in libraries of the consumer.  So I give them a pass and will continue to gobble up the rest of the series as they release it.

I grew up on a single episode of Emergency! - well, actually the movie ""The Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" - taped by my mom where she took out the commercials and anything that wasn't a fire truck driving or a rescue happening.  I caught it some on TV Land but the effort involved in taping the shows became overwhelming.  About a year ago I finally broke down and bought the first DVD - and that was all it took.  I didn't realize what a great show this really was.  I find it fascinating from a historical standpoint, but also am impressed at how well-done it is.

I don't want to harp too badly because I don't want to talk them out of release subsequent seasons, but season four has the worst picture and sound out of all releases so far. At the very least, they should have spent some time on cleaning up the sound, especially the inconsistent sound levels within episodes.

The show is great and worth watching even with the disappointing sound and video. Yes, I like the show enough to settle for a crappy picture. My son (3 years old) does not care at all. Whenever I come home from work, he is always begging me to watch ""fire truck show."" As it was my dad who was a firefighter and introduced me to the show at around the same age, it is hard to refuse.

3238872,3,B000XJD3JS,"My review of ""Emergency!"" Season 4 leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I was anticipating ""more of the same"" from the previous releases.

Season 3 upset me some in that included syndication prints.
My heart sank on the opening menu of season 4, with the poor quality audible of the ""Emergency!"" theme.

Not only are these syndication prints, there's no original master print to the entire ""E!S-4"" collection. What a shame for a great season. This is probably my favorite ""Emergency"" season, containing many note worthy episodes.

What's good about this release; it's a step above cable TV and VCR.
Though not all bad, my recommendation lies in Season 3, with more quality prints on the DVD's, better sound and presentation.

Universal really blew the enjoyment of this show for me.
Whoever cleared the release either had a deadline or didn't consider the fan base. I'm going on record at this moment; ""Universal, find the original prints to make a decent collection"".

Both Chet and Marco are given storyline, and the characters of all players become more rounded. This is no doubt ""Emergency!"" at its best, with budget, guest stars (Mark Spitz, John Ashton {Beverly Hills Cop, I & II} Reb Brown {Captain America, Uncommon Valor} in minor guest starring roles), and bigger explosions.

It's fun watching our heroes getting out of tight spots over and over, and from what I recall to be the best dramatic sequence using the defibrillator in ""Smoke Eater"". Although the patient in that episode passes on, it also spoke volumes in real life situations, that not everything has a happy ending, and also marks the shows realism and charm. (it also has, for me, one of the funniest goofs; Chet asks Marco for the salt and gets passed the ketchup, which gets used like it was the salt)

The best ""Emergency!"" series explosion also lies within the last segment of ""The Mouse"" episode.

I could go on marking more favorites, but find it in my heart to recommend this only for the die-hard fans, like me. The print quality is just too poor, (cropped, chopped and scratched, audio at times uneven and inaudible), and will dissapoint the majority of viewers.

These ""E!S-4"" DVD's need Emergency! treatment....I will end any further ""Emergency!"" Season puchases until I get some quality transfers from Universal.",1201824000,9,2295,4.894329896907217

3238874,3,B000XJD3JS,"I agree with the most recent reviews - this is a fantastic show, and season 4 contains many of the best episodes, but Universal's treatment of the DVD releases continues to be horrendous. I got used to seeing the sharp colors & good sound quality on previous releases (with the exception of the few on the Season 3 set that obviously didn't come from good masters & had the wrong opening credits tacked on) so this was a huge disappointment. Emergency! seemed to have escaped the awful treatment Universal gave to the sole Adam-12 & Dragnet releases, but that is obviously no longer the case. Also from reading the episode summary on the cases, it is obvious the writer of those didn't bother to watch any of the episode (eg: summary for ""Details"": ""The line between business & pleasure blurs when a stripper collapses in a nightclub & later does her best to entice Gage.""  .... uh, no - he dated a woman involved in an accident, & the stripper that collapsed didn't try to entice anyone except some mild flirtation with Dr. Early at Rampart. This is just one of the many errors of this type).
So buy the DVD set - it's not that expensive & it's better than watching tapes of the hacked-to-bits TV Land version, but as one reviewer has already said, the Columbia House tapes are far better quality than this disappointing release.
Shame on Universal. The ironic thing is, that if they released quality sets of the Webb shows, we fans would be willing to pay quite a lot for such a product, but they refuse to do so.",1201737600,7,1515,4.509090909090909

 While I am less picky than most reviewers about DVD quality (I have a small television with a so-so picture anyway, so I don't fret about less than perfect images), the picture quality on this set is amazingly bad even on my 13 inch tv -- jittery images, blurriness -- at one point you get about 3 seconds of white scratches across the screen. The sound quality too is less than ideal; as another reviewer noted, the dialogue is often barely audible, so you turn up the sound, and are then blasted out of your chair by the sirens!

Which is so much more the pity, because the episodes themselves are wonderful.  The writers have finally found just the right balance of humor and drama,(""Miss...?"" ""October."") characterizations have settled in and become more three dimensional, the acting is improved over earlier seasons, and production values are excellent.

While it's hard to complain about the price, why oh why can't they take just a LITTLE time to clean up the master tapes before releasing them on DVD?",1201737600,25,1153,4.632352941176471
3238876,1,B000XJD3JS,"After Universal's botched release of Emergency! - Season 3, I began to wonder what would be the worst case scenario for the release of Season 4.  After one year almost to the day, I went back and read my own review for Season 3, I still stand by it.  The common complaint of reviews for Season 3 was basically ""Great Television Show / Terrible DVD Release.""  Some of the shows on the Season 3 DVD release appeared as they did on TV Land with dust particles on the film, sound pops, blurred color and a mono soundtrack that sounded as though it was a fifth or sixth generation copy.  I understand this was also a common complaint with other Jack Webb productions by Universal (Dragnet, Adam-12, etc.)  Not to knock TV Land.  As I pointed out in my Season 3 review, I always appreciated TV Land for bringing the show back on the air after a nearly 15 year hiatus.  But I always noticed the TV Land airings of Emergency! had the same Season 6 opening, were cut by 5 minutes for each episode for commercials and the picture and sound quality were noticeably lacking.

However, some of the episodes on the Season 3 DVD release had transferred over intact from the original restoration from the Columbia House VHS release.  Those episodes both look and sound excellent.  They demonstrate what Emergency! can look and sound like when restored to its full potential.

When I thought about the worst case scenario for Season 4, what came to mind was that all of the episodes of Season 4 would have that low quality ""TV Land look.""  Well guess what friends, that's exactly what happened.  Every episode on the Season 4 release with the exception of the episode ""905-WILD,"" is TV Land sound and quality.  Ironically, ""905-WILD"" was an episode which featured actors Mark Harmon and Albert Popwell as the main characters, not Roy and Johnny.  This episode was intended as somewhat of a pilot for a series that never got off the ground.  Not even the episodes that were restored in the Columbia House VHS release made it to this release.  They look just as bad as the others.  The impact for me was not that shocking at all, I was pretty much expecting it.  This is a five star show with a one star release on DVD.  I'm expecting Seasons 5, 6 and the 6 Emergency! TV movies to be all pretty much the same low quality.  I just know they'll be TV Land versions of what I already have recorded on videocassette.  That's not much to look forward to.  I've given up waiting for Universal to do the right thing.  Universal's key goal appears to be making the highest profit with the lowest quality product.

I give one star for the extra 5 minutes on each episode that was cut for time on the TV Land airings.  To give any more than that, would be giving to Universal more credit than it deserves.  It looks like I'll be hanging onto my Columbia House VHS Emergency! episodes for awhile.  Indeed, the total worth of those videocassettes just shot up to an almost priceless level.  Thanks Columbia House for preserving the integrity of these episodes that this television show deserves.  No thanks to Universal. They continue to demonstrate their descent by putting profit over quality as they continue to relieve themselves on Jack Webb's memory.",1201737600,8,3226,4.5794066317626525

Extra being about $1500 a week.). And I can't wait for them to start releasing the Emergency movies.

My only complaint with Season 4 is the sound quality. I did not notice this problem in the earlier seasons but with Season 4 the sound seems all over the place. I watched about 6 shows (from several of the DVDs) with the volume high enough that I could hear the dialogue but when the sirens go off (either as they head to a call or from the call to the hospital), the siren sound is so bad (both in decibels and quality) that I have to turn down the volume about 8 or 10 notches. Plus there are a few other places in the DVD where the normal volume is too low and I have to turn it up 8 or 10 notches to hear the dialogue. If overall, the sound was low requiring you to turn up the volume, that is one thing. But to have the sound differ so much means I have to keep the volume remote in my hand at all times else my neighbors might think there are real fire trucks and such nearby!

Just a guess, I don't know for sure.

This set is a must for any Emergency! fan. The episodes are great and the actors had really settled into their roles and made their characters their own.

For those not familiar with Emergency!, overall this is a wholesome family show with good morals to it, which is what makes it so endearing in my opinion. You can watch it with young children and not have to worry about them seeing something that is inappropriate for them. Thankfully it stayed that way through all its seasons.

Disasters, accidents, mishaps, and the familiar 'Rampart 51' charactgerized the whole series for me.  By the time season four aired, I had moved onto the Six Million Dollar Man, and beyond.

Watching the 21 episodes of this ground breaking series for the first time, I realized why I do not appreciate the graphic medical effects of todays' productions.  The real stars of the show are not the special effects team, but rather Gage, DeSoto, Nurse McCall, and their developed skills. That is the way a show should be.

Build a following based on good scripts, a good cast, and competent set design.  Season Four is perhaps the most polished of the series, with all cast members comfortable and adjusted to each others' idiosyncracies.

Sit down, plug it in, and get ready for 'Rampart 51'!

3238882,5,B000XJD3JS,"By its fourth season Emergency had really settled into a groove.  The stories were exciting and action packed, and the writers and actors had the characters nailed.  Sure, Gage & DeSoto's fellow firefighters were fairly one dimensional characters - but they were FUN one dimensional characters, and the focus of the show was really Gage, DeSoto, Dr. Brackett, Dr. Early, Nurse McCall, and Dr. Morton anyway.

The realism presented on the show by this point had become expected, and the technical jargon was actually fairly well known and understood by the fans.  Emergency was a driving force behind the education of America on the procedures and perils of being a firefighter or paramedic, and it gave a glimpse into what doctors and nurses really did in a hospital.

The fact that Emergency was as successful as it was paved the way for later TV shows like E.R. and movies like Backdraft.

The previous DVD set (Season 3) was a hit or miss affair.  Good episodes, some looking good on the DVD, some just OK, but several episodes had the wrong theme song and opening credits. It was the same opening credit sequence used for the TV Land showings, which had always been a bone of contention with some fans (the original theme song was one of the best in TV history, and to have it replaced was foolish).  Hopefully for this set Universal gets it right.  (Update: Well, I've watched several episodes, and they all have the wrong opening theme.)

Even with the minor quibbles about past DVD sets, Emergency is a MUST HAVE TV show on DVD, and Season 4 is no different.",1199836800,27,1565,4.678832116788321
3238883,5,B000XJD3JS,"Emergency was the greatest show that was ever made.  This show is what got me interested in being a paramedic.  When I was in the 1st grade I knew I wanted to be a paramedic.  We used to play Emergency on the play ground as well.

With the release of the 4th season, my son and i will have something to wathc together.  he loves all those old shows that have to deal with fire, ems and rescue.

Thanks for releasing this set.",1198627200,,425,4.0602409638554215

I remeber playing emergency with my freinds and drove our parents nuts making the siren sound and runing through the hopuse saying that ""we were off to a rescue1"" If you were ever a fan of the show, and you have young kids now these are great DVD's to enjoy with them.",1198627200,3,409,3.823529411764706
