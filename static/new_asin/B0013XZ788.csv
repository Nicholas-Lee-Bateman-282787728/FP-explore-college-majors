3120761,5,B0013XZ788,This was given to my granddaughter.  She loves ALL the Veggie Tales.  I cannot wait to see it with her on my next visit.,1228608000,,120,3.9583333333333335
3120762,5,B0013XZ788,"A neighbor loaned me their copy of this dvd the other day to watch with my toddler and I had to order a copy of our own because he loved it that much!  Even though he's seen most of the material on other dvds or in the series, this is still a great compilation and perfect for when we don't necessarily have time to watch a whole dvd.  (We do the same with the Silly Songs dvds, too ... pop one in just long enough for one or two songs while getting ready to head out.)",1215648000,7,469,3.875
3120763,5,B0013XZ788,"I bought this for my grandchildren. We love Veggie tales and know there will be nothing inappropriate and always a good message.
This seems to be a combination of several older stories, however we loved it because of lot of ours are on tapes not DVD.",1214611200,2,250,4.456521739130435
3120764,5,B0013XZ788,Lessons From the Sock Drawer is a mix of old lessons and new. As usual the story lines are well drawn so children can relate and follow them easily. There is the ever present humor that adults even chuckle at. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy and learn from.,1211846400,3,268,4.173076923076923
3120765,3,B0013XZ788,"According to the bigidea web site, this DVD contains a lot of previously-released material. The following paragraph is copied from their site:

Short Features Include: Binky the Opera Singer, Going Up, Larry's Blues, Dr. Jiggle & Mr. Sly, Paco and the Singing Aardvark, Omelet, Gated Community, The Englishman Who Went Up The Hill, Larry's Lagoon, Paco and the Chicken, Modern Major General, Forgive-O-Matic, Lunch (A Parable), The Story of St. Patrick, Larry's High Silk Hat

Now of those, there are only three I'm not sure I've already seen (Binky and the Opera Singer -- although that may have been the 10-second clip on ""Autotainment"" -- and the two Paco shorts). The rest I'm certain I've seen on other VeggieTales DVDs. So if you've seen the entire collection, this is going to be mostly, if not entirely, repeats.

That said, a repeat of a VeggieTale is still better than 90% of what's out there on television or on the sales racks today, but it's difficult to justify the cost if you actually own all these shorts already. So, take a close look before you buy.",1208908800,31,1068,4.793478260869565
3120778,5,B0013XZ788,this is a compilation video but it also has a few shorts only on this disc. Our original copy was so welled loved by the kids we had to buy this one to replace it,1389398400,,162,3.657142857142857
3120779,5,B0013XZ788,Thank you for sending the Veggie Tales so quickly.  It worked just fine and had no issues.  (We love the variety of stories also.),1381276800,,130,4.375
3120780,4,B0013XZ788,"LFTSD contains some great bits, and is a cheap way of getting your hands on a tossed salad's worth of The Story of Saint Patrick (""Your name is now 'PIG BOY'!""), Larry Sings The Blues, the silent 3 Stooges spoofing classic known informally as ""Ze Piano, She Muss Go Up!"", the original ""Forgive-O-Matic"" (STILL better than any infomercial on TV) and the extremely weird (and stretching the bounds of even most Veggie fans' knowledge) ""Omelet"", including the moment Phil Vischer probably worried most about ""getting letters about this""- even saying so in the sketch.

On the downside, I could live my entire life without ever again suffering through the horribly unfunny and boring ramble of a popsicle-stick story about a lost hamster and the 4 Donkeys of the Apocalypse.  SPOILER: I just told you the only even vaguely interesting part of this painfully bad tale...yes, the title. That was it.

On the whole, this DVD is worth the price, even with the boring points. Saves buying other DVDS for the fun parts.",1368576000,,1009,4.854651162790698
3120781,4,B0013XZ788,"This is a collection of fifteen shorts (or briefs) reaching from 2008 back to the second VeggieTales video. If you and your kids watched all those, you've seen all these. That said, they're put together with bridging animation, in this case, the sock drawer, which is full of shorts and briefs-- get it? I was happy to find this collection because I like to watch very very short cartoons, and only one at a sitting. I nearly never watch a full-length animated movie, but a notable exception was The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-Who-Don-t-Do-Anything-A-Veggie-Tales-Movie-Widescreen/dp/B001CK7ONI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie (Widescreen)</a>), the second VeggieTales movie after Jonah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonah-A-VeggieTales-Movie/dp/B002Q61PEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie</a>), which is so funny I watched the trailer for it, which begins this disc, over and over. The other treat they don't mention is a medly of bits from all the VeggieTales videos at the end of the disc, which is not only witty and entrancing but visually stunning. If your kids did watch all the vids, they'll probably shout out which story each bit is from.

Anyone dismissing these tales as cartoons for church kids ought to watch one. At a time when nearly every kids' cartoon on PBS carries a moral at the end, these are teachy but not preachy. Watching the extras, I realized that the animators and writers are like those on any other cartoon. There's a feature on how to draw Paco the mule, which has a crazy expression, but it's no different than when Walt Lantz used to show how to draw Woody Woodpecker. There's a bit with animators talking about ""A brief history of the shorts"" and how they came up with (big) ideas. There are strange, crazy little absurdist bits, ""Archie's Oddities"" and ""Paco's Stories"" that are made-up tall tales for comic relief. There are humorous voice-overs of old black and white movie footage in ""Pa Grape's Home Movies"". There's nothing in those shorts to ""get"" and kids get that. Adults will love watching the hyjinx with their kids. Watch one a day and it will last about a month. Who needs cable when you can ""program"" such fun shorts on your DVD player?",1353628800,,2376,5.387096774193548

There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but I'm surprised that they didn't include any new content to keep it interesting.
