187223,4,1568556829,"This simple story has the old fashioned, ""everything works out in the end"" story line, but I enjoy that for relaxing sometimes. It's a good story for kids, with a little drama, some accidents and a little reality check which many of today's stories don't have. I'd recommend for children or anyone interested in a relaxing, heart warming little tale.",1390089600,,350,4.85
187224,2,1568556829,"Good young kid entertainment.  Acting is awful. Almost funny bad.  Kids liked it, but as an adult find something else to do.",1389657600,,124,4.590909090909091
187225,4,1568556829,Great movie for the most part.  Did the boy have to be so rude and inconsiderate throughout?  I love the dogs and the race at the end.,1372982400,3,134,3.925925925925926
187226,5,1568556829,"This was a ""mistake"", my buying this film, as I intended to only  put it on my WatchList to maybe rent later because I was one of the first to rate it & probably view it.  I hit the wrong (right?) button & purchased a wonderful movie instead. Great drama, wonderful acting, very edge of the seat experience and heart-warming .  Great for any age or spiritual and moral persuasion.  This story takes place in beautiful snowy Canada in the 1920's.  Might sound ""blah"" but is definitely a keeper to share with anyone at all especially after some films that make you blush & turn your head even when viewing alone  Enjoy!!",1365465600,19,618,4.473214285714286
187227,5,1568556829,"Okay I'm the first so I will have ""me"" way with my review.  My beloved youngest introduced me to discovering the love shared between meself and our dog (a pug).  Me daughters will have a copy of ""Hatchi"" for Christmas and we will all enjoy watching this simple but beautiful movie that is about, simply LOVE...  Take a few minutes of you life.  The movie isn't perfect except for the joy that is offers between life and those creatures that ONLY want to share it with us...",1352851200,8,473,4.402298850574713
187228,3,1568556829,"The movie was good, but because of some intense scenes, it's best for older kids. There is a scene where a man kills a poisoned dog with a shovel, to put it out of its suffering. ( The shovel is shown only shoulder high, but it's still pretty intense for a little kid to see.) Also, there's a scene where a dog is shot and is shown bleeding and lame. The dog doesn't die, but it looks like he might. So if you don't think your child can handle scenes like these, you better not get this movie - or wait until they're older.",1185235200,13,523,4.038461538461538
187229,5,1568556829,"Excellent picture quality, great story, pleasing dialog. DVD extras are wonderful and easy-to-use, should motivate further study.

""Everything was wonderful, but I wanted more."" ""It was interesting to know about the author because I might like to read some of her other books."" ""We loved the story. We laughed, we cried, and we cheered."" Best for ages 8 to 12.",1001030400,24,530,5.247058823529412

187240,3,1568556829,"A good story about a boy, a sled dog named Kayla, and...the memory of his explorer father who disappeared after his last expedition some 8 years earlier. The boy dislikes his stepfather, seeing him as a usurper of his father's position as his mother's husband; and he fails to recognize a neighbor carpenter's daughter's contribution to his sled dog team for having built the sled based on a design by his father. Despite his idolizing his father for his extensive knowledge, we hear of false and prejudicial views held by him about Eskimos.

My problem with the story: I was not persuaded that the boy ever did fully change his attitude toward his stepfather--an open admission of his hostile stance toward a loving stepfather is never made; nor did the carpenter's daughter ever given a promise of enlarging her role in the sled team.
So, I never got to like the boy very much. 3 1/2 stars",1478476800,,891,4.67515923566879
