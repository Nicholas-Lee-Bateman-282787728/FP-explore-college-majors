7826575,3,6302497116,"'Hot Under The Collar' is just fun. If your going to see this film for whatever reason, personally I hired it to see Mindy Clarke and I was just in histerics. Mainly because Mindy is SOOOOOO funny- she really has a gift for comedy. So if you just want to laugh, even if it seems silly just go for it- definitely for the lovely mindy Clarke. Who didn't love the scene when Mindy as Monica says in the convent says about ''Who could be more studlier than God?''.
