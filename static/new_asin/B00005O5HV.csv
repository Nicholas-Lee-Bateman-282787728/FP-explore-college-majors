Terrible plot, dialogs and score.

Well, if you like watching half-naked guys in a swimming pool it might cover your expenses, otherwise I suggest you choose something else.",1129939200,,252,4.704545454545454
1640287,2,B00005O5HV,"Not much more to say about this movie than has already been said in other reviews. I thought it was just me who had these views on this movie, obviously not. If I could give this movie a -20 I would, and that is no exaggeration",1117670400,,227,3.9565217391304346
1640288,4,B00005O5HV,"First of all, I was at Hollywood video getting ""The Brood"" and when I popped the movie in that night, I didn't notice it was the wrong movie until it was over and I took it out my VCR.

Don't get me wrong, there are some nice looking guys in this film and I was pissed they didn't do(...) to each other but this movie is kinda gay. Like with the pool scene and when the guys are rapping the girl. And these so called models they casted in this movie were alright but one dude in there had some big (...)lips. They were so big he could kiss two people at the same time, but other than that, the movie is about this new guy comes to town and he offers these 3 guys to offer they're souls to the devil by breaking all 10 commandments.

It was alright, but I wouldn't get emotional and say it was grrrrrreat.",1106611200,,804,4.01875
1640289,2,B00005O5HV,"It makes sense that this film has some sort of Roger Corman 8-10  day shoot schedule at the core of it.
The film NEEDS  desperately to have at least a few scares in it, but it fails there.
The Sexuality? Who cares???
This film fails as a Horror film. Hopefully someone might take the central ideas and rewrite the film with a bit of a budget.
Even so, if Scarecrow can do what it did for a low budget, and even the somewhat larger budget BUBBA HO TEP can basically run on the sniff of an oily rag, I think something needs a fix for this failed horror flic.",1102464000,,556,4.091743119266055
1640290,1,B00005O5HV,"Having seen the first of this series, we could immediately guess when DeCocteau would use slow motion scenes where the studs walk around the campus.  These scenes are ridiculously stupid, as they serve no means whatsoever.
Again, we see lots of studly beefcake in their underwear, and yes, Virginia, this is a homo-erotic movie.  Didn't you notice the way Luc looked at John while he was supposedly screwing Torrie?  And the scene in the swimming pool, kissing the tears. Come on, DeCocteau is obviously heading for the gay audience; even though there are not homosexual scenes, the inferences are there.
And the long drawn out rape scene is so stupid, the music is something out of the eighties and nineties, and there is not one genuine thrill in the whole movie.
And the ending....these kids have no remorse over the people that have died due to their own selfish motives.
Yuck, what a waste of time.",1074988800,2,903,4.7756410256410255
1640291,4,B00005O5HV,"Ok, every single one of these reviews are EXTREMELY MISLEADING!  I love horror. And I considered this to be a cool mediocre horror movie that I very much enjoyed. I am a straight male (not say I am homophobic or sexist cause actually I am about as far from those 2 things as you can possible get). Yet, I definitely enjoyed this flick. When I rented this film from bl0ckbuster there was absolutely no indication on the box that this could be considered a ""homo-erotic"" film but rather just seemed like a rad horror film that I would enjoy. AND I AM GLAD IT DIDN'T CAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF IF IT DID! Truthfully, IT NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL I READ THESE REVIEWS that this could be considered a ""homo-erotic"" flick. Not to mention the fact that there IS female nudity in this movie! I would also like to point out that every character in this movie IS STRAIGHT! So, unless you're a right-wing bas:terd don't let the whole homo-erotic thing discourage you from getting this movie if you like the idea to it.
This movie is about three high school outcasts who all have a real problem with authority (which I like) by the names of Marcus Ratner, John Van Owen and Matt Slaten. Yet despite they're individualistic attitude, the narrator, Marcus longs to fit in. Then they met Luke. He's the new kid in town. Luke (a warlock) promises them that they could have anything they want, rule over everyone, have girls, money, power, everything they've ever dreamed of and more! All they have to do is pledge loyalty to Luke and each other (the brotherhood) and break all ten commandments as well as various other rituals. However, what he told them were lies. As the movie progresses it is quite clear that Marcus and his two friends are not getting stronger but rather Luke is getting stronger and John and Matt are practically becoming slaves to Luke's will. And the only one willing to realize this is good old Marcus. Suddenly, loneliness and jock bullies become the least of Marcus's high problems.
If you are a fan of horror, I suggest you definitely check this great independent film. However, if you are new to horror, this is in no way the place to start. I highly recommend ""Christina's House"", ""Ghost Ship"" and ""American Werewolf in Paris"". But whatever you do, steer clear of the independent flick ""Wendigo"".

1640292,4,B00005O5HV,"With great respect for all opinions expressed and implied by many of the ""reviewers"" on Amazon and those critics in print:
The fact is simple. What David DeCocteau is doing here is taking a cheesy, 5-10 day shoot horror genre and making something a little different out of it... twisting the traditional T&A into P&A (a humorous comment made by an earlier reviewer, and it is totally true!, I think a fair amount of good judgement is required before purchasing this DVD.
Does this film cater to the young female audience? YES!
Does it cater to a gay audience? YES!
Does it require or demand any substantial brain matter or deep analysis to enjoy or otherwise ""figure out"" this flick! Heck NO!
We are dealing here with cheesy horror and a small tad of ""sexploitation"", even though, in a review of the Brotherhood I, I stated that David DeC. was not being a sexploitation artist, it seems that it is now necessary for me to correct that statement, as to avoid confusion...
First... there is absolutely NO GRATUITOUS NUDITY. There are NO ""in-your-face"" sexual contents in this film. There IS however, a plain and simple fact: This film, like several others by David DeC. have a blatant, and, gratefully unashamed, appreciation for the male form, and the unique sensibility to delve into the taboo areas of male-bonding, body worship, and the ability for lead characters of the male genre to exercise psychological control over their male counterparts. This clearly makes some of David DeC.'s works ""HOMOEROTIC"". This may make some uncomfortable, it may also stimulate others.
I humbly disagree with those who may object to this film because of the homoeroticism as deeply as I disagree with those who find that they have been misled into thinking this title is a ""gay film"". It is neither! It is simply a different way of dealing with the genre of fast produced, low budget, horror films that this reviewer, as a lover of the horror genre, was pleasantly surprized by!
This film is well acted with a usual lineup of young TALENTED males of whom Dave DeC. is well known to acquire. I see nothing wrong with giving a handsome young man a ""first break"" in the film industry... because it seems that David DeC. does that quite a bit, and the results are usually rather good! (Frankly, I am glad that David hired them first... what is the other possible option for a young talent? Without mentioning it, smart ones know the answer!)
In particular, the perfomance by C.J. Thomason should be noted. The guy was only 18 when this was shot, and it was his first role in any film production. I wish him the ABSOLUTE BEST! There were several scenes in this film that other young actors had problems with,(specifically, the locker room, intimidation scene)which C.J. handled BRILLIANTLY! (C.J. was not the first actor to audition for this role, but his ability to handle it resulted in his hiring just two days before shooting began). (Reference source: David DeCocteau's commentary on the double collection dics of ""The BrotherHood"")
If you simply can not stand the sight of bonding between young men, then do not buy this title. If you want love scenes that are explicitly gay or a 100% gay film then don't buy it either. (There are so many other titles out there.. but if you are a true collector of gay-themed cinema, I would urge you to not pass this one up!) And, certainly, if you want a complex horror movie with all the trimmings, (say the like of ""Poltergeist"" or ""Alien"" or the ""Shining"") this is not the film for you either. [ A special note to readers of this review who are GLBTQ: David DeC. is so much smarter than one could think... In the ""BrotherHood I"" it was necessary to share ""blood"" as part of the plot... In this 2nd film (note: NOT a sequel) there exists a similar element, which the director was keen to point out: the ""sharing of tears"" is necessary to be part of the second ""brotherhood"". So we have BLOOD and then TEARS. Both, bodily fluids, but the parallel between the two speaks volumes. I suspect David DeCocteau is sending a message to all GLBTQ people... at least, to those of us who lived through the horror of the 1980's and the pan-demic of AIDS. So... I will not simply discard this film as without any complexity of thought.. in fact,, I think the director knows exactly what he is doing.. since parts 3 and 4 are now in production, we should all see within the year if there is such a depth to my thinking. For now, it makes sense to me! ]
But... if you want a film that is off the edge a bit, has no great depth of thought, but rather a simple storyline (predictable), smacks clearly of homoeroticism, has beautiful male leads (that are talented) and maybe redfines the word ""THRILLER"" (only becuase it may ""thrill"" the viewer in a unique way that it thrilled *this* viewer)... then I think it is worth investigating!
Respectfully submitted.

1640293,1,B00005O5HV,"Okay, we all know that sequels tend to be lame.  This one is no exception.  Unfortunately, it's a lame sequel to a lame movie.  Talk about the law of diminishing returns.
Producer/director David DeCoteau and screenwriter Matthew Jason Walsh reunite for the second installment of their Brotherhood series.  However, other than recycled sets and recycled themes, there is nothing to connect this movie to The Brotherhood--except actor Forrest Cochran who is theoretically playing the same character, but as I don't remember the character at all in the first movie, it's hard to call it a true connection.
As with the first, it is a thrill-less thriller and about as ""straight"" a piece of homoeroticism as you're likely to encounter.
Actually, to be fair, the underlying premise of this installment is slightly stronger than the first, even if it isn't related, and the plot is a little more interesting.  However, the execution is weaker.  The acting is adequate, with only Sean Ferris exhibiting any real charisma.  This is unfortunate, as the whole point of the character Luc is supposed to be his incredible charisma, and Forret Cochran doesn't have the presence to pull it off.
This time, the story takes place at a private high/prep school, although it appeared to me to be the same location on which the original was shot.  The student body is keep in a perpetual state of anxiety by a quartet of shirtless bullies.  Three outsiders are the primary focus of the bullies.  New student Luc arrives and offers the outsiders a way to get even which involves swimming in their boxer briefs and sitting in a satanic circle while wearing boxer briefs.
The quotient of screen time of guys in boxer briefs is higher than the first, and there are two female quasi-leads, doubling the number from the previous installment.  The camera work and the editing is slightly better than the first, but there are still times when DeCoteau would better serve his audience by pulling the camera back and using more fluid editing.
It's weak, but what truly appalled me was the amorality of the ending.  As a reviewer, I don't think it's fair for me to give away the ending, and I won't, but I have to admit that it really angered me.  Screenwriter Walsh hasn't thought through the ramifications of his characters' actions, and this left me quite annoyed.
Another place where Young Worlocks matches its predecessor is in the lack of any bonus material on the DVD.  The movie is presented in 1.33:1 screen aspect ratio.  As this was probably shot for direct-to-video, I don't know if there was a version with a wider screen aspect ratio. ...

1640294,1,B00005O5HV,"My friend accidentally picked this one up at the rental the other night, and we watched it just for the heck of it. It was horrible. Plotless, pointless, straight-to-video dud about a coven of warlocks at a prep school. There were plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. There were bad actors. There was obviously a badly written script that the bad actors had to work with. The dialogue was hilarious and stupid, and the scenes that were supposed to be ""disturbing"" were too dumb to be taken seriously. We just laughed all the way through it. I could easily go outside in my backyard with my video camera and make a better movie than this.
Another thing about this bomb was that it ended horribly...but, then again, what can you expect from a piece of crap like this? I've read the director's filmography just for fun, and his earlier work is not very appealing. His name is David DeCoteau, folks, and he just may be the next Ed Wood! I bet when you compare the two, Ed Wood probably looks like Steven Speilberg next to this guy.
All in all, this is a movie to avoid, but if your looking for laughs...well...it might be worth a look. *THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR*",1002240000,3,1165,4.423255813953489

I made the mistake of buying the entire series because of the write-ups on the back covers.  The only all-pervasive theme that ties this ""series"" together is swelling music and close-ups of rippling muscles and young male bodies undressing down to their identical boxer briefs.  Oh, one more theme that ties the series together comes to mind ... major head-tripping male ego follow-the-leader games.

Pure silliness is simply not my thing.  If it's yours, hey ... go for it!
