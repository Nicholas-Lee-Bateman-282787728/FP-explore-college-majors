7910779,3,B00000ILF7,"Maybe because of its simplicity, children get bored for viewing the second time. However, for the very young children (0~3years) would sure find them interesting.",1402444800,,162,5.52
7910780,5,B00000ILF7,"I ordered this DVD to have a video of the russian animated the TWELVE MONTHS which I had seen on YouTube. Seeing it on my 27 inch Toshiba TV made a big difference! The hand painted full cell animation looks both sharp and clear with vibrant restored colour and clear stereo sound to the music. And the other russian animated films, CINDERELLA, THE LAST PETAL, WISHES COME TRUE, THE SNOW GIRL, and HOUSE ON CHICKEN LEGS are all delightful! What would make it all trully ideal  would be the inclusion of the original russian language tracks with english subtitles! The Hayao Miyazagi DVDs sold by the Disney company offer the choice of watching Miyazagi films with either the original japanese language with english subtitles or the american language dub soundtrack! But the english dub track is very nicely performed here on all the films on this DVD and they don't feel or sound dumbed down! If you buy The Snow Queen - Golden Antelope - Bench - Cyclist - Fence (DVD NTSC) you will see that movie well restored with the complete original russian language track and music! THE TWELVE MONTHS is a charming winter tale about a peasant girl named Christina who has do all the work for her fat stepmother and spoiled stepsister(stepmothers have a bad image all over the world in fairy tales!) Meanwhile a spoiled young queen( who is also an orphan as is Christina) demanded that someone find snow drop flowers in the middle of the winter snow to prove that she the queen can make it spring at her command, or else they will lose their heads! Christina is sweet and sympathetic while the stepmother and stepsister are funny in their foolishness and self centered ways. There is also menace in the form of the young queen and dub voice Amanda Plummer comes off as regal and spoiled in her performence, not being able to understand the unfairness of her ways until she is taught a lesson by the Twelve Months of the year who are depicted in this animation as god like beings who represent spring, winter, summer and fall! When old man winter gave the stepmother and stepdaughter dog skin coats to keep them warm the 2 of them put them on and they transformed into dogs! When the young queen saw that she quickly said,""I'll be good!!"" The animation bears a resemblance to the award winning russian film THE SNOW QUEEN based on the Hans Christian Anderson story. Both THE LAST PETAL and WISHES COME TRUE have a good sense of humour. In the LAST PETAL a cute little girl is presented with a magic flower that grants wishes! When she wished to have all the toys in the world all the toys came running to her from everywhere and she got frightened as they surrounded her!!

It became both funny and scarey as she was cornered and then wished the toys to go away! When she saw that her friend Victor was a cripple she then wished for him to be well again using the last petal. When Victor became well and could now walk she now knew the best kind of wish is a wish for others! WISHES COME TRUE shows what happens when a lumberjack is given the power to make anything he wishes come true! But he didn't know he had this power given to him by a grateful fairy! Martin Sheen voiced the lumberjack who found himself banished from the country along with the princess who fell in love with him because he wished it! When he wished that he could fall in love with her it happened and the fairy then realized she was no longer needed! The russian version of CINDERELLA has colourful stylised art with a thin Cinderella, who seemed like she was a skillful acrobat, as she jumped and leaped at the bidding of her cruel stepmother(again!) The backrounds have a lovely pastel look about them and Sarah Jessica Parker narrated and voiced Cinderella very well. Finally HOUSE ON CHICKEN LEGS took a segment of  the music of Mousorgsky's ""Pictures from an Exibition"" and illustrated it into a short cartoon where a witch's house compelled a young girl to enter it and she then ran away out of it and back to the safety of the farm where baby chicks do a danse that reminded me of the Disney Silly Symphony COCK OF THE WALK! This 3rd volume of Stories of my Childhood may be the best one of this series, judging by what others have said about the other volumes. I would highly recommend THE SHAKESPEARE ANIMATED TALES DVDs on amazon.com for more great russian animation with british actors voicing the characters of the Bard's plays! I have that set of DVDs and it's great!",1388534400,,4442,4.522388059701493
7910781,4,B00000ILF7,"I love all the cartoons in this collection, but the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I like it more in its original version with the original songs. It's nice to watch it in English, but the songs are changed and it makes difference. Only if you never watched it in its original language then you wouldn't know the difference. But it's still nice, so I rate it with 4 stars!",1290816000,4,384,4.202702702702703
7910782,5,B00000ILF7,"This is part of a set of 4 DVDs - a stunning collection of Russian animation, that centers around well known and Russian fairy tales. Some of the movies reach back to the 60's, but are no less charming and colourful than todays animation.

This particular DVD features Twelve Months,The Snow Girl, Cinderella, House On Chicken Legs, Wishes Come True, The Last Petal. I loved them, when I was young and my children do so as well. I purchased with amazon and the service was exellent.",1142985600,6,482,4.604651162790698
