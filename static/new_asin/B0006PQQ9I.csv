2190805,4,B0006PQQ9I,"moon night stalker although some acting was not that great it was a good slasher flick of the 80's.  i have always been a fan of the campfire stories at night. when your out in the woods, around by the fire, it is a great time for a killer story.",1208390400,3,246,3.92
2190806,5,B0006PQQ9I,"ok the acting is bad.. the story kinda sux and the effects are crappy as well..

but who cares this movie is actually a pretty decent idea EVEN IF IT'S BEEN DONE TO DEATH and the killer was pretty groovy.. I just wish he had stayed in the straight jacket and hood outfit throughout the entire movie!

but oh well none of you will be reading this will you?

but you can get this movie for less than a few bux new from the merchants so go grab it!

yeah!",1148169600,4,452,3.988888888888889
8042212,4,B0006PQQ9I,"MOONSTALKER (aka: CAMPER STAMPER) begins w/ a group of young people, partying and dancing badly. As a couple slips away to a nearby camper, they are brutally slaughtered by an ax-wielding madman. Meanwhile, the bad dancing continues, unabated. Luckily, the ax-man comes for these folks as well. Fast-forward to another group of campers. This time, it's a family affair, w/ mom, dad, and their two bratty teen kids. Yeah buddy! It's burgers in the snow! Soon, an old timer in a gargantuan Cadillac pulls in, dragging a camper along. He tells everyone to call him ""Pop"". He seems nice enough. Pop has lots of campfire stories, especially about his son, Bernie. Pop tells them of Bernie's nervous condition. He starts to act a bit creepy, so everyone calls it a night. That's when we get a peek at who Pop has w/ him in his trailer! Yep, the family vacation is over! There's a survivor, so, the chase is on! Serendipity intervenes, as a group of camp counselors is meeting close by. Can any of these people possibly make it through the night? I found myself enjoying MOONSTALKER far more than I had anticipated. The characters range from goofy to zany. The killer is absurd, yet entertaining. The plot is pretty typical, but doesn't take things too seriously. This movie is more fun to watch than most of its type. Gorehundts take note: The gore / blood level is minimal, and the kills are mostly off camera. Mostly off camera, since we are thrown a bone or two, as in leg and arm bones! Gasp! You will never hear ""She'll Be Comin' Round The Mountain"" in the same way again! Ever! Extra points for the sheriff's department, featuring 20-gallon hats on half gallon heads! Joy beyond belief for the slasher / cheeeze enthusiast...",1503964800,2,1725,4.696369636963697
8042213,1,B0006PQQ9I,bootleg release. vhs transfer - save your money.,1490140800,,48,5.125
8042214,4,B0006PQQ9I,blu-ray looks pretty good.  Keep in mind this is a regional film shot at night.  I highly doubt if this film will ever look better.,1478563200,2,131,4.2
8042215,1,B0006PQQ9I,This is NOT a Blu Ray.,1477958400,,22,2.8333333333333335
8042216,3,B0006PQQ9I,"This is a pretty decent but cliche 80's slasher that takes place on a campground in the winter. The theme is a blatant rip off of John Carpenters iconic Halloween theme so I chuckle every time I hear it. There are no special features.

My only complaint is not even that it's on BD-R but a blu ray disc in general. It's pointless and gives people the idea that it will be either in HD or at least DVD quality video. The transfer is just awful. This looks like it came from a dubbed VHS. Very dark and low resolution. I hope one day this gets a proper blu ray restoration if the original elements are still available.

If you're a big obscure 80s slasher fan, I would recommend this movie for your collection but just don't expect good video quality.",1475884800,,749,4.304964539007092
8042217,2,B0006PQQ9I,Was a bit excited to see a Bluray release of Moonstalker. But unfortunately this a fullscreen VHS qaulity of it. It's pretty much the same as the previous release that came in a cardboard sleeve and this is a BDr  (burn on demand disc) good movie but poor release.,1470268800,2,264,4.387755102040816
8042218,5,B0006PQQ9I,super fun any slasher fan should buy this film,1428624000,,46,4.222222222222222
8042219,5,B0006PQQ9I,"This great ""campy"" horror flick, is chock full of intense scenes and interesting means of murder.
From the first appearance of the killer, to a vacationing family led by Harry {portrayed by none-other than author Ernest Abernathy},
to the final suspenseful scene of this film... it delivers.
It was quite hardcore for it's day and well worth a view.
The killer is better with an axe than slash.",1383264000,,394,4.8088235294117645
8042220,2,B0006PQQ9I,"I bought this because my brother plays the man with the killer son.
It is pretty corny. I suppose it could become one of those classic camp movies, like Night of the Living dead.",1317427200,2,178,4.264705882352941
8042221,4,B0006PQQ9I,"This is one of my old favorites. During my college years I used to see it advertised on The Horror Channel and it seemed really creepy, especially the still they used to announce it was ""coming next"", featuring a close-up of the killer in his hooded straitjacket in the darkness of night. And while it took a while before I finally saw it, it had decent atmosphere, decent music and many memorable scenes and dialogue that stuck with me through the years.

But now, seeing it for the first time in so many years, it doesn't seem quite as good as I remember. It seems a bit formulaic and some characters talk about others a lot but have very little shared screen time with them. In fact, a lot of characters spend very little time talking to anyone who isn't their boyfriend or girlfriend.

It doesn't make this a bad movie, but somehow it doesn't feel like the greatness I remember.",1230854400,2,882,4.472049689440993
