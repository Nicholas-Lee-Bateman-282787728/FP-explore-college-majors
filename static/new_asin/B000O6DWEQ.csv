8183126,1,B000O6DWEQ,I could not believe how bad this was!  He shows one technique where he spins the opponent around and throws him up against the wall.  Good luck on the streets with that one.  Another technique shows him covering up his head with both arms and then walking away while being punched.  Was this whole thing some kind of a joke?  In all of these combinations his opponent just stands there passively and does nothing like the opponent pictured on the DVD jacket!,1452729600,,458,4.536585365853658

8183128,1,B000O6DWEQ,"It is the second Loren W. Christensen DVD I purchase. I must be stupid (I should have learned since the first one (Solo Training) it was not a good purchase) Well o.k., ""Fighting Dirty. A no sweat guide to hard-core self defense training"" might be even worse. I Expected a dvd about really ""no sweat"" guide to hard-core self defense. Somethig a person 50+ would actually use... In the real world. I expected a DVD dealing on how to strike, poke nad/or press certain areas or points of the body which would leave the attacker out of combat. like for example eyes, throat, temples, ears, groin, etc. But no. It was a dissappointind DVD about common strikes in hypothetic (therefore irreal) scenarios.",1311897600,3,698,4.729508196721311
8183129,5,B000O6DWEQ,"Fighting Dirty-A No Sweat Guide to Harcore Self-Defense Training, is one awesome DVD. Loren W. Christensen is one of my favorite Reality Based Self-Defense authors and instructors. This DVD is thorough and covers a lot of material. It's especially made for people 40 and over who either don't have time to attend a RBSD class or the inclination. If you want to know how to effectively defend yourself I highly recommend this DVD.",1291680000,5,429,4.890410958904109
8183130,5,B000O6DWEQ,"I have been fortunate to have reviewed numerous books and videos by the highly prolific Loren W. Christensen. I have never been disappointed in his material. This DVD was made because he received many requests for a practical self-defense video for people over forty years old.  In my opinion, this DVD has achieved its goals, but you do not have to be forty years old to learn from this DVD.  There are over 50 techniques spread over several sections.  It is interesting to me that he teaches the very same hands up and open technique that I have been teaching police officers and citizens for more than thirty five years.  He moves on to some very good practical blocking techniques, basic hand strikes and the kicks you need to effectively defend yourself.  He demonstrates how to defend against various types attacks using the basic techniques taught in this DVD.

In conclusion, if you are seeking to learn a practical self-defense system without spending years in a dojo, this video is for you.  This DVD will also appeal to all martial artists and those specializing in practical Combatives.  The techniques and tactics are solid.

 Rating: 5 Stars:  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Pro-Systems Combatives Manuals Vol. 1,2).",1251244800,7,1227,4.9365853658536585
