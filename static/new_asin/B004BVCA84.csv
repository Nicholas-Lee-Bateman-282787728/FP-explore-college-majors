8422400,5,B004BVCA84,"Well deserved user rated five star average. Really a well done, well thought out movie unlike any other WWII drama I've seen. I don't think a lot of people know about this gem, TCM shows it from time to time. The video and sound quality were pretty good, though the picture showed a couple of flawed moments, a line going down the screen at times for several seconds, probably irreparable. Characters were believable and no one seemed miscast. All actors did a fine job. Good action, intrigue and story in general. The Germans spoke German and the Danes spoke Danish. AMG gives a rating of three stars but I'd give it four.",1506643200,,623,4.571428571428571

8422402,5,B004BVCA84,"The studio trailer states, ""Out of the night come the Wolf Packs of the Sea!---To ignite the most daring adventure the screen has ever known!""  O.K., that's a bit of a stretch---but Sealed Cargo is a taut and suspenseful WWII maritime yarn nevertheless.  This Pal Region 0 DVD played flawlessly on an Oppo BDP-93 and the transfer quality is adequate.",1480291200,,350,4.816666666666666

8422404,5,B004BVCA84,"This is a black and white film made in the 1950s. The story is set in the North Atlantic, on the Grand Banks fishing  grounds. in the 1940s. It is a spy mystery-drama with a good cast and plot. The story is based on the book 'The Gaunt Woman' published in 1943. The story has several twists and turns leaving the audience to ponder, excitedly, on where the plot will lead. Why has the square rigger suffered from attack by submarine gunfire but not been sunk? Why is the canvas sail covering the lifeboat full of holes, but the lifeboat is unmarked?  Why was the fishing boat's radio sabotaged? Which of the two Danes on the fishing boat's crew is a traitor - if either? Why does the square riggers captain agree, eventually, to be towed into a small, local fishing port? Buy the film and find out!",1397865600,,798,4.385135135135135
