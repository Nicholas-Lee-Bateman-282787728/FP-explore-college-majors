8568962,4,B00BI8SE9C,"This is a very enjoyable recording of Winterreise -- not my favorite, but close to it.  I did not get the video, but the DVD.  In the case of the DVD there is a very elaborate booklet included, that gives each song on facing pages with German and English.  So I was very happy with the package.",1432598400,3,294,4.12280701754386
8568963,2,B00BI8SE9C,"Amazingly there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES! In music that depends totally on the words to create its mood it is incomprehensible that there would be no subtitles in any language other than German. This is particularly infuriating as it is beautifully sung and recorded.
Sadly one must say DO NOT BUY THIS DISC unless you are fluent in German. The amazon information talks about it being dubbed in English (which I mistakenly took to mean English translations would be available). The short black and white doco has English subtitles as the artists explain their interpretation, but all that does is make it even more unacceptable that the text is not translated for sale outside Germany.",1371686400,6,685,4.965217391304348
