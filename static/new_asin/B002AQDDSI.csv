3891009,5,B002AQDDSI,"The Read & Share DVD Bible videos are excellent.  My grandchildren from age 4-11 will sit, enthralled.  The 30 minute format is perfect for the younger ones.  The Bible stories are well representated and I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants to increase their children's Biblical knowledge.  We watch them over and over at our house.",1290470400,13,346,4.913793103448276

8360041,1,B002AQDDSI,"Please don't waste your money on this one. Just buy either The Jesus Movie or even better the 3 hour version. You will regret buying this one. For some reason, I thought this would be new content, but it was literally the exact same video that was in the other longer version (ie. The Jesus Movie or the 3 hour version). I was so disappointed that I paid for this very short video. Maybe it's 30 minutes, but it seemed like 20. The box says the running time includes the bonus material, so the actually movie is like half that. These are really great videos. My toddler seems to understand and repeat everything that is going on, so my review is not reflexing the quality or content of the production, simply how short it is for the money and how it is the exact same content as the other longer videos. I was disappointed and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake",1420070400,7,876,4.315151515151515

8360044,3,B002AQDDSI,"I have not seen this, but my daughter in law said it was way over my 3 year old grandchild. It was well recommended for 3-7 year olds on other sites and I wanted my grandchild to have exposure to the true meaning of Christmas . . . not just Santa Claus. They barely started watching it and she said she turned it off because she didn't want to explain unwed mothers to the child.  I plan to borrow the DVD and watch it and see how much she is over-reacting. Even if some is over a child's understanding, the basic Christmas story must be presented in this DVD.",1388620800,,560,4.137614678899083
8360045,4,B002AQDDSI,"This is a great movie! My 20 month old loves the read and share dvds. They keep his attention and he is learning biblical truths at a young age. The only thing I was disappointed about:  this movie is the exact same as The Jesus Movie, which we already have. The advertisements make it seem like a totally different movie, but in reality, it is the exact same one, minus 20 minutes. I was disppointed that it wasn't a different movie like I thought. I would highly recommend the Read & Share dvds. We also have all of the old testament dvds and they are wonderful! Just know that The Jesus Series movies are excerpts from The Jesus Movie, not different dvds.",1386633600,6,658,4.39344262295082
8360046,5,B002AQDDSI,"I bought this for my 3 & 4 yr old grandchildren.  They love it (so does mom and dad and grandmother).  The animation is so cute.  Kind of slow.... but at this age, slow is savored!",1373241600,,180,3.9444444444444446
8360047,5,B002AQDDSI,"I didn't actually see this DVD, but sent it to my 4 year old grandson.  I feel it is so important for children to learn at a very young age that Christmas is about so much more than Santa.  I asked him if he liked it and he said he did.  Later on he did mention to me that it is Jesus' birthday.  Mission accomplished!",1357516800,3,318,3.8461538461538463
8360048,5,B002AQDDSI,"I love this dvd, but it is pretty short.  It kind of ends abruptly, i felt like it could've been longer, I wanted it to be longer.  Will order more in this series, definitnely.  A christmas tradition has been solidified :)",1293926400,5,222,4.365853658536586
