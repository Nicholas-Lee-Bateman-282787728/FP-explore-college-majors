i am very excited to have bought this",1328054400,,330,4.092307692307692
7928381,4,B00004ZBXQ,"When the skits work (which they generally do) this comedy production raises what is essentially candid camera work to an art form level. Dom Joly explores a number of themes (answering an absurdly large mobile phone, running away, cliched spy scenes) in the same way as a painter explores the themes. I would say get this collection as compared to the whole series, it has the best skits in about the right quantity.

There is no ""canned laughter"" laugh track in the background - which adds kudos to the production. Also helped by some very well placed theme music... you might find yourself humming the songs long after the gags are a distant memory.",1215388800,,651,4.7105263157894735
7928382,3,B00004ZBXQ,"Not ""Complete Series"" but only a ""Best Of"" unfortunately: as the show unedited, is one of the best ever to grace a cathoid ray tube or digital tv screen.

Just as the US version of the Trigger Happy TV show doesn't work (due to the lack of the UK public, who are necessary for the gags to work); the timing and length of the show is also crucial. The show must be in it's half hour format to work: it's final gag being punctuated by the familar electric theme song outro; the silence of which is often followed by a final 'response line' from the last 'gag victim' (such as John McCririck) to great effect.

However, 'Best of Trigger Happy' dvd's edit a season's ""best of"" into one 90 minute programme. Not only is it totally mysterious as to who gets to decide for everyone which bits are ""best"", but the show simply does not work when edited into a 90-minute episode. It's just too long. The show was devised for half hour episodes, and that's the only way it works.

Like all ""Best of"" comedy dvds, this one is annoying because watching it will just remind you of all the scenes and sketches that are missing...which of course you'll remember from when you saw it on TV first time round. What's here is good, but it will just make you want to see the rest, which isn't here. That's why 'Best of' Dvd's are so annoying. (I'm looking at -you- 'Best of Adam & Joe'; 'Best of Trigger Happy 1,2,3'; 'Best of Balls of Steel';'Best of Smack The Pony'; 'Armstrong & Miller' etc).

Hopefully one of these days there will be a DVD release of ""Trigger Happy TV: The Complete Series"" that really is complete. (And a re-release of the 3 cd soundtracks would be a great idea, too!)

Then, can join the ranks of other comedy shows whose DVD's are COMPLETE![Much love to ya 'complete' dvd's out there: Fonejacker; Brass Eye; Jam; Day Today; Big Train; Bo Selecta; Vic Reeves Big Night Out; Stella Street; Sealab 2021; Dream On; Robot Chicken; Police Squad. Thank you for your complete completeness as I first watched you on TV, it's great to view you again the way I remember you!].

Get with the program, Trigger Happy TV! Release a DVD set of the complete series! The original is unequaled, and the US version pales by comparison!",1209081600,2,2219,4.466666666666667
