4445294,4,B004QI14GG,"Probably of all the matadors of history Manuel Laureano Rodrguez Snchez (4 July 1917 - 28 August 1947) known as ""Manolete"" is the most famous. 'He rose to prominence shortly after the Spanish Civil War and is considered by some to be the greatest bullfighter of all time. His style was sober and serious, with few concessions to the gallery, and he excelled at the 'suerte de matar'--the kill. Manolete's contribution to bullfighting included being able to stand very still while passing the bull close to his body and, rather than giving the passes separately, he was able to remain in one spot and link four or five consecutive passes together into compact series. He popularized a pass with the muleta called the ""Manoletina,"" which is normally given just before entering to kill with the sword. In addition to all of the major bullrings of Spain, he had very important triumphs in Plaza Mexico. He died following a goring in the right upper leg as he killed the fifth bull of the day, the Miura bull Islero, an event that left Spain in a state of shock. Manolete received his fatal goring in the town of Linares where he appeared alongside the up-and-coming matador Luis Miguel Domingun, who, after Manolete's death, proclaimed himself to be number one. In response to Manolete's death, General Francisco Franco, then dictator of Spain, ordered three days of ""national mourning"", during which only funeral dirges were heard on the radio.'

Writer/Director Menno Meyjes ('Max', 'Foreign Student', 'Empire of the Sun', 'The Color Purple', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', etc) seems to have taken that fact that all the world knows of Manolete and instead of creating a biographical account of the man's life he instead opted to provide a sensitive meditation about love and obsession and death.  For many this film will not work as it is not a recreation of facts, either about Manolete or his lover Lupe Sino or the historical atmosphere of Spain at the time of the story, but for those who appreciate the music and the scents and the passion of Spain, this film will satisfy.

The film begins with the decision of Manolete (Adrien Brody, who looks very much like the character Manolete!) leaving his peasant life to go to learn bullfighting under the tutelage of Pepe Camar (Juan Echanove).  Despite the fears of those who consider the young man not fit to enter the realm of Toreros, Pepe convinces Manolete to persevere - and to become a Torero he must avoid drugs, alcohol and women.  But as Manolete enters the bullrings of Cordova and Madrid and Mexico he gains the status of a star and becomes infatuated with the beautiful Lupe Sino (Penlope Cruz).  Despite Pepe's warnings the two become lovers, have moments of profound passion as well as moments of infidelity on the part of Lupe.  Manolete is conflicted between the love of his mother and the love of Lupe and Lupe is afraid Manolete flirts with death each time he enters the ring. Finally in Linares in 1947 he competes with Luis Miguel Domingun (Nacho Aldegue), is gored and dies from his wounds.  The film ends with the famous march of the pallbearers bearing Manolete beneath a rain of red rose petals as the world mourns the death of a hero - and Lupe disappears into nothingness. No spoilers here because this all is a documented history that everyone knows.

The performance by Adrien Brody is subtle and underplayed adding to the dignity of a memory.  Cruz is an exotic if overplayed Lupe.  The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is breathtakingly beautiful and the mournful music by Gabriel Yared and Dan Jones is pitch perfect for the effect director Meyjes has created.  As the credits roll at the end there is a hauntingly beautiful Canto Jundo sung by an unnamed female singer. It is a perfect ending to this meditative remembrance of a hero.

Personally I love Adrian Brody and I thought he was wonderful here so watching him kept me going.  Penelope Cruz looks just right as the slutty mistress.  At times I thought she was channeling Sophia Loren which is not really an insult, just that she seemed to be playing an attitude, rather than a real person.

The whole bull fighting world is shown here, in its glory and in its gory.  (sorry)  Somehow for something that's supposed to be all about passion, the film left me curiously dry-eyed.  Still Adrian Brody was wonderful.",1445299200,,642,4.669642857142857

4445300,4,B004QI14GG,"If the entire film contained the pathos of the last twenty minutes, I would give it five stars. SPOILER ALERT: Most Americans won't like that scene because they will think it drags on. It does, but so does the moment of death, and this death, and the way it touches the lives of others, is one of the most beautiful moving moments in film.

The dialogue at the end, between the mistress and the manager, ""So I killed him?"" -- ""No, we all killed him!""

I laughed aloud a few times, I liked what I thought of as the realism, the capturing of 1948 Spain (and 1952 Mexico), and the acting was superb throughout. I enjoyed the passionate, gritty, wailing flamenco singing. If bullfighting is as old as ancient Minoan tales, then this film has a timeless theme: that humanity, in courting its destiny, is courting its death.

Despite loving parts of this film, I would give it three stars because I just hated the bullfighting scenes, however well-done and choreographed they were, and they were brilliant! The whole animal cruelty aspect upset me, even knowing that the cattle whose flesh I roast on the barbecue each week die more horribly.",1442707200,3,1136,4.641791044776119

Adrian Brody seemed a strange choice for a Spanish matador but looks a lot like Manolete and did credible job of portraying him.
The bullfight scenes are extremely realistic and convey much of what it feels like to attend a real bullfight,

4445310,3,B004QI14GG,"It's OK, barely OK.  One would think that Brody and Cruz would have been perfect, and they do LOOK perfect.  But there is a current style of Masterpiece Theatre Acting that drives me crazy.  It is the theory that if an actor whispers, the performance is more truthful. Volume has nothing to do with truth or good acting.  The entire movie is spoken in a whisper.  I wanted a hearing aid. After a while I just gave up; if they don't think it's important enough for me to hear, I don't have to hear it.  The LOOK of the film is wonderful--all that satin, sequins, ""suits of lights"", crowds, bullrings--great faces in Spain. All those background people look (and act) just right.  I wish it had been better, but there is not much of a plot--a biography by people who didn't really know the character.",1384819200,,797,4.455172413793103

4445312,4,B004QI14GG,"It would have been so, so easy to mess this up, but director Menno Meyjes does the job visually very well. But the story is really a bit thin and we all know the ending, so it comes across as a bit two-dimensional and predictable. The actors do their best and Brody is very good, but it seems that Manolete wasn't that interesting a person. Good insertion of historical footage at the start and end. As an aficionado, it's an attractive DVD; for those who have no interest in bullfighting, it will have less appeal, although there is very little bullfighting in the movie.",1379808000,,572,4.509615384615385
4445313,3,B004QI14GG,"There are two things that pop out in this movie. The sound and the visuals. First, the sound. I don't know what it is about the sound, but it sounds like everything is filtered through tin cans. At times you can't understand the dialog because it is either overpowered by the music or that distracting echo-ey effect. It almost made me turn the whole thing off.

But then there are the visuals. The cinematography sucks you into this wonderfully visual world. It's artistic, pretty, moving, and tells a story all on its own. Very effective.

Cruz looked more lovely than I've ever seen her. Brody is always so incredible. (It really is amazing how much Brody looks like Manolete). I don't think they had the greatest chemistry, but their acting ability made up for that.

The story is an interesting and entertaining one, but isn't told very fully. There are a lot of things that aren't fleshed out. The viewer has to guess about certain things. I don't think that that made it bad, but it made it less than it could have been.",1378512000,,1027,4.570652173913044

4445316,4,B004QI14GG,"This film is cool, and interesting and well done - not ""el stinko"" as someone else wrote. Penelope Cruz is amazing as always, and Adrian Brody looks so much like the real Manoleto, it's uncanny ... It's their love story, set against the struggles of being a bullfighter ... She wanted him to give it up, but he resisted, and of course, lost his life. I actually had a hard time watching the culminating scene ending in Manoleto's fatal injury ... though I knew how it would turn out. It was cool to see a film based on such an interesting and beloved man/bullfighter. He's certainly captured the hearts of so many, and this film gave us a peek into his love and world.",1334620800,3,668,4.395161290322581

However, I was totally disappointed.  The story made no sense as it wandered from one scene to the next with no continuity.  I never could figure out how the scene where Lupe had scrawled a message on the mirror fit in with the  rest of the movie.  The entire 'love' between the two seemed forced and not real. Talk about miscasting! Adrien Brody may look like Manolete, but the chemistry between him and Cruz simply did not exist.

4445320,4,B004QI14GG,"Adrien Brody nd Penelope Cruz are paired in a visually pleasing movie about the real life love story between a famous spanish matador and his lover.  It is a story of a beauty and the beast, two people who come from poverty and fight for their survival in this world any way they can.  In the process, they meet each other and madly fall in love.  Although a fearless matador, Manolete is deep down insecure and indecisive.  His feelings of duty towards supporting his mother and his unmarried sisters is definitely an obstacle to his relationship with beautiful Lupe who has a shady past but deep down loves him dearly.

Their physhological make up makes them a great couple.  Their love for each other is passionate and unrelenting.  Nothing can get in a way except fortheir own selves.  I absolutely adored the story about their courtship.  Everyone and everything that can get in a way of their relationship does.  But this is an obsessive love, all consuming for both of them.  In the end, all that can separate them is death.

The filming was beautiful, artfully done.  Though Cruz seemed to channel her Sophia Loren side, I still enjoyed seeing her in this part. Adrien was excellent.",1318809600,2,384,4.457142857142857
4445323,3,B004QI14GG,"This movie is not a good movie...unless you are a fan of bullfighting.  The story of Manolete as depicted in this movies is sloppy.  It does not show Manolete's rise to stardom and becoming Spain's hero. It quickly and directly goes from meeting Lupe, meeting his manager and then poof, he's a star.

What is good about this movie is some of the old footage of the real Manolete in the ring.  The fashions and the world of bullfighting as it was 60 years ago are a delight to watch.  Penelope Cruz is always wonderful but the  relationship portrayed with el diestro Manolete is mostly fiction.

It was so horribly edited and chopped up that I had no idea what was going on. I've read reviews from people in other countries who saw the movie in the theatre and this video is NOT that movie.

The bull!
The most natural actor, arguably - Oscar nominee material, in the movie came to the screen with enthusiasm, emotive courage, aggression, strength of character, gracefulness, head and tail held high grandeur and superbly articulated grunty/snorty lines.
Sadly, his finest moment of victory or honorable bull heaven was denied to us at the end, his won over viewing fans.

4445327,1,B004QI14GG,This movie had no reason to be this terrible. Good actors. Great story line. Beautiful location. Horrible movie. This was supposed to  be a love story but seemingly only one of the participants was in love. The matador was beloved but that never showed until the very end. During the story it seemed he was just famous. None of the characters were fully developed.  The main character goes from trying to become a bullfighter to being a famous bullfighter but one never sees his rise as a bullfighter. It seemed like all of a sudden he was famous. There was supposed to be this great love affair but it seemed like they were just sleeping together and he liked it more than she did.  On the surface it doesn't seem that it would be that hard to tell a story of a bull fighter who fell in love but this movie really did a terrible job. This movie never completely told any story.  Actually the movie El Cantante did a much better job of character development and telling a story. I read that the US version of this movie is 60 minutes less than the version that was released overseas so somewhere in the world this may have been a good movie.,1310774400,15,1141,4.367924528301887

4445329,2,B004QI14GG,"I tell you why:
1. The director had all five star cliches he could party with:
2. The matador, played by an absolutely elegant Adrien Brody
3. The seductress with a past, that would drive men crazy- although the oh so beautiful Penelope did not need a fake ass to make her remarkable in that sense (that was kind of embarrassing.) Here, she blends Sophia Loren, Paz Vega and ""Gilda"".
4. The matador constant furious attraction for love-and-death
5. Spain
6. Passion
7. Blood
8. The traps and hardship behind success
9. The mother figure disputing the man with the seductress

Too many ingredients for a quick meal! He assembled enough to make an epic story. Instead, he had to condense it all in a short time, so that you feel like there is no main knot in the drama to be solved: a little bit of infidelity, a little bit of family issues, a little bit of the matador art by itself, and then a little bit of her past to add trouble here and there, but no depth in any questions. The actors do good and look so good, that we do wish we could relate to the characters more, maybe feel the passion that drives lovers into the dark pits of existence, but the chemistry does not happen.
Visually glamorous. Bad dialogues. No convincing emotion.

4445331,3,B004QI14GG,"I have been fascinated with the legendary Manolete since I saw a picture of him in a book in my high school Spanish class decades ago. When I found Adrien Brody was playing him in what I thought would be a long overdue film biography, I was quite excited. He looks very much like him, and has the acting chops to portray the great torero. But what I saw was a cliched romance that could have been on Lifetime or the Oxygen network, except it had more expensive production values.
Why didn't the scriptwriters, director, etc., delve into the story behind what was the most famous bullfighter of all time? Is it because they think Americans of today don't know who he was? This could be true. In our society you have people who don't remember who the last two Presidents were. But then, why bother to make the film at all? Who wants to see a seedy love affair between two not very interesting Spaniards?
The real Manolete was fascinating. He set new standards for the art of bullfighting. He was an elegant, enigmatic, graceful master of his craft that was part of his heredity, his bloodline. He was equal to the most famous celebrities of his and our time. There was a wealth of material to tap on, but instead a rather sordid, poor man's Hemingway-styled love affair is the whole story.
The few moments Brody gets to show his stuff, when he first steps into the ring in ""shoes that don't move"" and arches his back with instinctive authority, and when he does cape work so softly and eloquently in front of Penelope Cruz, are about the only time you are allowed a vision of the great matador.
The climactic fight in Linares with the equally doomed bull ""Islero"", is chopped up too, cutting to shots of Cruz driving frantically to the ring.
I know it took a long time to release this film. It even has had a few different titles. Too bad it didn't have a different script.
This is one time they should have gone long on the bull. And I mean the ones with the horns.",1308787200,2,1964,4.413223140495868

When aging bullfighter Manolete is told that a younger matador is as good or better then he is, he begins to try and cheat death even more.  Will the love of Lupe help him in the ring, or endanger him?  This is another very slow moving movie. The acting is very good and the scenery and bullfights are fun to watch and look at, but it just doesn't really seem to go anywhere sometimes.  This movie is at its core a love story, mixed in with the action of the bullfight.  There is actual footage of the real Manolete mixed in with the filmed scenes that is a very nice touch and adds to the experience.  Not knowing anything about the real people or story I have no idea how accurate this is, but the love at times is tested to the limits.  Overall I would say this is more of a movie that women will enjoy more then men, but it's not a horrible thing to have to sit through. I have sat through much, much worse.  A very OK movie, nothing to special. I give it a B-.

He fell in love with a prostitute despite the advice of the people who care for him.  It was a volatile relationship where he was being pulled back and forth.  Adrien Brody played the role of Manolete really well, sober, dignified, gallant.  Penelope Cruz was impressive as Lupe, a seemingly disturbed woman who doesn't think she deserves his love.  With the demands of his profession, the constant hostility between Lupe and his handlers, his leeching family, and the rise of other torreros, Manolete becomes emotionally distraught and puts himself in unnecessary danger.  He dies trying to show he is better than the young upstart Luis.  While he is dying, he kept calling for Lupe, who he named Mamita but people thought he was calling for his mother and she was never allowed to go near him.

In response to Manolete's death, General Francisco Franco, then dictator of Spain, ordered three days of ""national mourning"", during which only funeral dirges were heard on the radio.'

Writer/Director Menno Meyjes ('Max', 'Foreign Student', 'Empire of the Sun', 'The Color Purple', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', etc) seems to have taken that fact that all the world knows of Manolete and instead of creating a biographical account of the man's life he instead opted to provide a sensitive meditation about love and obsession and death. For many this film will not work as it is not a recreation of facts, either about Manolete or his lover Lupe Sino or the historical atmosphere of Spain at the time of the story, but for those who appreciate the music and the scents and the passion of Spain, this film will satisfy.

The film begins with the decision of Manolete (Adrien Brody, who looks very much like the character Manolete!) leaving his peasant life to go to learn bullfighting under the tutelage of Pepe Camar&aacute; (Juan Echanove). Despite the fears of those who consider the young man not fit to enter the realm of Toreros, Pepe convinces Manolete to persevere - and to become a Torero he must avoid drugs, alcohol and women. But as Manolete enters the bullrings of Cordova and Madrid and Mexico he gains the status of a star and becomes infatuated with the beautiful Lupe Sino (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz). Despite Pepe's warnings the two become lovers, have moments of profound passion as well as moments of infidelity on the part of Lupe. Manolete is conflicted between the love of his mother and the love of Lupe and Lupe is afraid Manolete flirts with death each time he enters the ring. Finally in Linares in 1947 he competes with Luis Miguel Domingu&iacute;n (Nacho Aldegue), is gored and dies from his wounds. The film ends with the famous march of the pallbearers bearing Manolete beneath a rain of red rose petals as the world mourns the death of a hero - and Lupe disappears into nothingness. No spoilers here because this all is a documented history that everyone knows.

The performance by Adrien Brody is subtle and underplayed adding to the dignity of a memory. Cruz is an exotic if overplayed Lupe. The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is breathtakingly beautiful and the mournful music by Gabriel Yared and Dan Jones is pitch perfect for the effect director Meyjes has created. As the credits roll at the end there is a hauntingly beautiful Canto Jundo sung by an unnamed female singer. It is a perfect ending to this meditative remembrance of a hero.

So, Brody has the biggest nose in all of Hollywood..THAT doesn't make him Spanish. AND it definitely does not make him a good actor, except maybe in the Middle East...
