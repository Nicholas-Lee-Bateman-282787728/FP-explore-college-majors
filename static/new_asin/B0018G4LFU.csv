3417416,5,B0018G4LFU,"I have been going to the Y for aerobic group exercises for many years,(I'm 75) and decided I needed a break. This DVD fills the bill, I can do it in my own home whenever I want. My only wish would be that it was longer, but you do have the option to do it over again if you want.
I also got Mirabai Holland's Fabulous Forever easy strength and easy stretch DVDs and find I can combine them however I wish for the perfect workout.
This is easy exercise, and you feel energized when you finish. Highly recommended for senior ladies like me.",1235692800,67,538,4.1826923076923075

3417419,4,B0018G4LFU,A very long introduction.  It is better than many other beginning Aerobics as it seems to be geared towards the over 50 crowd.  I enjoy the person who does the video - Mirabai Holland she is very pleasant to watch and relaxing to listen to.,1459468800,,240,4.311111111111111

(Instructor doesn't demo the moves, but they are easy.) I've been at advanced levels of step aerobics but got sedentary for over 3 years and gained weight due to health problems. I decided I was not having this, so I ordered this DVD to get back in the saddle and it is ideal for me, for the next 6-8 weeks or so. My doctor said I *did have to start from beginning, and he was right. The intensity and time (about 15 minutes in addition to warm-up and cool down) are just what, er, the doctor ordered.",1434844800,,628,4.155737704918033

This isn't a very fair thing to say, but I found her a little irritating, but can't say why.",1373414400,,216,4.046511627906977
3417453,2,B0018G4LFU,I am fairly active as a fifty-something woman. I think this video is for women with health concerns that prevent them from vigorous exercise. I watched it once. I would give it to my mother who is in her eighties or wait until I am older.,1365811200,3,238,4.195652173913044

3417456,5,B0018G4LFU,"I usually walk for exercise, but sometimes it's too cold or it's raining and some days can be exhaustingly hot, so I looked for an exercise video that would give me a good moderate work-out without being too hard, too fast or too demanding. I like music and I like to dance and the description fit all my criteria.

It's perfect. I like the facilitator, the music, and the amount of time it's taking me to learn the routine. At some point I may do it on my own with my own music, it's that easy, and yet--I sweat.  I feel pleasantly relaxed and energized when it's over.

I recommend this DVD to older people and beginners who aren't passionate about exercise but who just want to stay in shape with a daily routine. It can be used every day or sporadically when one's regular exercise is not possible. I would highly recommend it for people who find it difficult to get away from the house for one reason or another.",1364256000,2,917,4.350877192982456
3417457,5,B0018G4LFU,"This is a great workout to do before work in the morning to start your day feeling stretched and energized. It was not difficult, but did give an overall light workout to get your body moving.",1362182400,,192,4.361111111111111
3417458,4,B0018G4LFU,"First, please let me say that in general I think this is a good video for those of us over 50 who want to keep flexible and just that bit healthier. The dance moves are good and they exercise most of your body. Having said that, I must say that I have two bones to pick with Ms. Holland. I am a musician. I have been a musician for nearly 50 years. My timing and sense of rhythm are rock solid, so to speak. During the dance part of the video, I can count at least six times that Ms. Holland is noticeably off the rhythm of the accompanying music track. This is not at all helpful as my natural inclination is to keep on rhythm (I'm sure I'm not alone here). Now, to be fair, I'm sure it's not easy giving instructions whilst moving. And perhaps the music track wasn't loud enough in her ear. But, in the end, her not being on the beat so many times makes it more difficult to do the dance exercise correctly. My other complaint is the lack of warning she gives with many of the steps. She starts moving and then tells you what to do. This does not happen all the time but it happens enough to, again, make it more difficult to get things straight. Those things aside, it's a good deal for the money but just be prepared to be 'flexible' as you go through the video. And, yes, I still give this product 4 stars.",1358812800,3,1311,4.1050583657587545
3417459,5,B0018G4LFU,Was very happy to have found this DVD.  It is a good addition to my exercise program.  As a meditator I appreciate exercise and music that is compatible with the more quiet and balanced energy.,1357948800,,193,4.485714285714286

3417462,1,B0018G4LFU,"I really thought this video would have more exercise to it.  It was way too simple, and it only lasted 15 minutes.  Hardly long enough for any sort of exercise.  It was more of a warm up, or cool down.",1349568000,5,201,3.975
3417463,5,B0018G4LFU,"Before I purchased this shorter, 26 minutes DVD, I read other people reviews. One young lady wrote, that she is more advanced and it was not enough for her. I am 65 and counting and when I finished exercising/dancing, I just had enough (not to say, that I did not exercised in the afternoon more with my weights)
I would recommend this video to beginner and younger-advanced person, because we don't have always time to do full hour, like other Mirabai's DVDs are. With her wonderful smiling face, and her ability to show how easy it is, you will LOVE this and each one of her DVD.",1337126400,6,581,4.4392523364485985
3417464,2,B0018G4LFU,this has one 'dance' routine. for the money there should have been more. very moderate pace. short explanation about taking heart beats per minute. way over priced considering it only contains one 'dance'. slow enough for a beginner.,1326240000,4,233,5.157894736842105

I just used it last night and had quite a work out.  I believe you use every part of your body.  It's easy to follow and lasts for about 25-30 minutes.

3417469,4,B0018G4LFU,I am in my early 70s and wanted something that would help me to increase my fitness level in my own  home without it being too strenuous.  This DVD was perfect.  I used to be a dancer so following the steps was very enjoyable and after a few times I had learnt the sequence of them and could add little touches of my own to the movements.  I was so pleased with the DVD that I bought it for my friend for her birthday and she reports that she too finds it perfect to follow daily without having to go to a gym (which she did for six months but has given up!). So for older ladies who need to keep fit but are limited in their choices to do so I would certainly recommend this DVD.,1309910400,7,680,3.9416058394160585
3417470,5,B0018G4LFU,"This video is just what I wanted. I am 56 and was looking for something to get my heart going, but low-key so as not to promote injury (tendon problems).

3417474,4,B0018G4LFU,"I guess when I saw the title ""Cardio Dance"" I thought that it would be for all fitness levels, but it is not.  I am an advanced exerciser who loves doing really fast dance workouts.  However, my mom who is in her late fifties tried this DVD and loved it.  She does it all the time now.  After you do an easy warm-up, Mirabai Holland, the teacher, teaches you easy moves to do that are great for older people who can't do the really fast DVDs.  The hardest move is a knee lift, and you could probably modify it to not have to do it.  The moves are taught, then done a lot of times that it made me bored, but older people will love the repetition as it will help them learn the steps.  There is a cool-down at the end with a bit of stretching, as well.  My mom's heart rate really gets up, but it doesn't affect mine at all.  It is a really short workout that older people and beginners to exercise will appreciate, but intermediate and advanced exercisers, go somewhere else.",1261094400,42,974,4.193548387096774
3417475,5,B0018G4LFU,"If you've never used a dance/exercise DVD or haven't taken an exercise class, this DVD is a great, nonthreatening way to start and to get a reasonable aerobic boost.  The instructor keeps it simple and walks you through the moves.  This was important to me, a baby boomer and first-timer who had just been disappointed by another dance/exercise video I had bought, by another instructor, who zipped through the moves so fast that I couldn't learn them.  I used to dance casually when I was younger, like most of us, but it had been a long time since I'd had to think consciously about coordinating arm and leg movements. This instructor makes it easy. If you spazz out on a couple of the moves the first time, don't worry -- you'll get them the second time around. Again, she keeps it nice and simple.  She also does warm-up and cool-down/stretching at the beginning and end, respectively. Note:  This DVD isn't for people who are in gung-ho competition with themselves and want to collapse in an exhausted heap at the end of the workout and lose 10 pounds in two days.  It's for the rest of us.  (P.S. If you're a first-timer and have a hectic lifestyle, like me, beware of the dance/exercise DVDs out there for ""busy people""; e.g., the ones that cram everything into 10-minute aerobic sessions. As mentioned, the one I got didn't spend nearly enough time on teaching the moves, and I ended up not using it.)",1247356800,177,1409,4.612

8269737,5,B0018G4LFU,"I bought this video several years ago when I wanted to get into doing daily exercise.  I have used it about once a week (interspersed with other workout videos, including others of Mirabai's) ever since and I really love it.  It makes me feel good to do these dance moves, so it's my go-to video when I don't really feel like exercising.  If you're looking for a super-high energy, heavy sweat routine this is probably not your video, but if you're looking for an enjoyable workout that makes you feel good, gets your body moving and your heart rate up this is a great choice.  I like to have a variety of different types of workouts to choose from (some more exuberant than others), and this workout is always in my rotation.",1470960000,,726,4.4772727272727275
8269738,5,B0018G4LFU,"One of her best videos.  Not too vigorous:  just right for seniors and those just starting an exercise program.  In her other videos, she assumes you already know the steps, so she gives no instruction there--but here she does.  Also, in the other videos, she tends to call out a new step after she begins it which leaves you trying to catch up, but here, she gives warning.",1468886400,,374,4.455882352941177
