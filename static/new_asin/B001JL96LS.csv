8313079,4,B001JL96LS,"These are both 1932 Harry Carey westerns produced by Weiss Brothers Artclass Pictures. The gem of the package is ""Without Honor"", not only because it's just damn good but rare for Alpha on these B westerns the original print source  is about as good as you can expect on these ancient non major studio films. The main attraction ""The Night Rider"" isn't bad itself but suffers in the print quality department when compared to ""WIthout Honor"". ""The Night Rider"" is more typical for Alpha, an old video transfer from a well worn 16mm TV print with lots of extra cues punched in the film by various TV stations for the purpose of inserting commercials, possibly involving cutting out scenes to fit film in particular slots too. This film frankly looks more like VHS at the four hour speed than what today's film transfer technology is capable of. Amazing what a difference nice print quality does make though so get this for ""Without Honor"" and enjoy ""The Night Rider"" as the bonus. Harry Carey is fine in both! Recommended!",1411603200,2,1020,4.730337078651686
8313080,4,B001JL96LS,"Like most low budget b-westerns it could use a good soundtrack and better dialogue but Harry Carrey is different . Look at his walk , the way he leans on a bar and the cadence of his conversation and you can pick up many things the the Duke used sparingly in his acting career.

In a world of short attention spans, fast music video cuts and high definition, this may not fit in to your sixteen year old's ""facebook"" mind so take it for what it is and let your self be transported to a time when watching movies on a Saturday morning meant riding with your favorite cowboy, shooting your cap gun and booing at the bad guys.

If you try hard enough you may even smell the popcorn.",1402617600,3,679,4.2153846153846155
8313081,3,B001JL96LS,"This is a different type of western in relation to what they started making in the 50s. Almost a mystery western. The use of secret panels in a western is unusual and made it interesting. I found the script to be kind of trite, but being a very early movie, script writers probably hadn't gotten their act together yet. I think it's still entertaining.",1399420800,,352,4.515625
8313082,5,B001JL96LS,Don't think Harry Carey ever made a bad movie; look for his Buck Jones-type humour..........,1254182400,3,92,5.2
