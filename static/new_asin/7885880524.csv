7900636,5,7885880524,"Director Kaneto Shindo made this film shortly (7 years) after the bombing of Hiroshima. He was born in Hiroshima in 1912 and died in Hiroshima at the age of 100. The film is an earnest and sensitive appeal for peace. If at times this film is unavailable from Amazon, it can be found on YouTube.",1427241600,,294,4.363636363636363
7900637,5,7885880524,"Kaneto Shindo's movie is without any doubt one of the best ever made. It deals head-on with one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of mankind: the dropping for pure geopolitical reasons of a nuclear bomb on a city thereby killing thousands of innocents citizens in the twinkling of an eye and wreaking havoc for centuries to come on a country (and also very slightly on the whole living world) because the human genetic basic material has been damaged.

Kaneto Shindo's movie shows preeminently that the fate of the world and the human species depends solely on the responsible or irresponsible behavior of every single person on earth.
In this movie, a teacher is looking for survivors among the children of her kindergarten class. There are only three. On her own initiative, she tries to secure a more hopeful future for one of those.

This impeccably played movie (also by the children) is simply unforgettable. A must see.
For a geopolitical interpretation of the dropping of the atomic bomb I highly recommend the book `The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb` by Gar Alperovitz.",1398816000,,1090,4.886486486486486
7900638,5,7885880524,"Director Kaneto Shindo's 2nd feature was the first independent film produced by Kindai Eiga Kyokai association which the filmmaker founded with Kozaburo Yoshimura. The powerful film focuses squarely on the devastation of Hiroshima city by the A-bomb, depicting the people dealing with the aftermath, including a dying girl praying for the humanity's peace, a shoeshine boy working hard for his poor surviving family members... The screenplay was based on the life stories of reallife children who were A-bomb vitims.",1302739200,8,516,5.544303797468355
