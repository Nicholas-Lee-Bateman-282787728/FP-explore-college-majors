8129519,5,B000G8P1Z0,"Here's an excellent buy! Two Kermit (Ken's brother) Maynard "" Mountie Films"" from 1935 and both looking quite good for their age.
In the opener, HIS FIGHTING BLOOD, Kermit covers-up for his sniveling younger brother Paul Fix (who made a career playing this particular role-type in 1930's B-Westerns) and takes the rap for a jewel robbery. Kermit is later cleared of all charges and becomes a mountie only to come up against...yep, his dirty dealin' more sniveling than ever brother! Kermit puts on several displays of fancy trick riding in this one showing off his talents. A highlight here has Western bad guy favorite Charlie King playing a mountie!?!
In the second film, WILDERNESS MAIL, Kermit's twin brother(a mountie) is killed trying to bring in Fred Kohler and his henchmen and Kermit vows vengence. This film is shot on location (at Big Bear, I suppose) in a very deep snow. We get along here by dog-sled & snowshoes...no horses!!!
This makes for very interesting viewing. And Fred Kohler is a pretty chilling cold-blooded killer, cracking jokes and even admiring himself on a wanted poster, yet brutal and quite deadly. Kermit goes a little crazy at the end trying to carry out his vengence scheme as the two duke it out in the snow as pictured on the dvd cover. Comic sidekick Syd Saylor plays it straight as one of Kohler's henchmen giving the role some depth, appearing more natural instead of your typical order obeying cronie. I don't even recall seeing Saylor's famous bobbing adam's apple laugh gag which was never really funny to begin with.
All-in-all an excellent package for those of us who love this kind of stuff! The prints are nice and clear and very watchable and the audio is quite good as well. A bargain from Alpha Dvd. Highly recommended!!!",1204934400,,1770,4.8256578947368425
