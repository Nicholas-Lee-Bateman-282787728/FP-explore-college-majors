7306958,5,B0109ODDTG,"Huge shocker that nearly all the negative reviews/rants appear to be written by males. I thought this movie was great. Reminiscent of ""Teeth"" but instead of magical realism, this was smooth flowing and elegant pure realism...albeit bizzare and brutal at times.",1441152000,7,260,5.365853658536586

7306960,3,B0109ODDTG,Very strange. Has to be one of the strangest movies I've watched in months and I'm normally a fan of the strange. Felt felt very feministic in a way and somewhat revealing about the way men treat women. Worth the watch but not twice.,1440028800,,233,4.318181818181818

7306964,1,B0109ODDTG,"I usually try to offer a more substantial review, but this movie was so profoundly tedious and directionless.  I would not offer too much in the way of clarity. As Larry Lipton said and should have advised the star of this drivel: You don't have to see your shrink, there's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet.

 If you are in the mood for the stereotypical bohemian/Artsy cartoon character, meets a nails on the chalkboard voice, meets preachy women feign palpable anger toward men, meets no discernible compass, than pal, this is the movie for you.  My advice, kick yourself in the shin instead; it will feel so much better when you are done and you will save about 54 more minutes of pain.",1438387200,7,738,4.526315789473684
7306965,4,B0109ODDTG,"Extremely different kind of film. FELT is very dark and disturbing on many levels. It's mainly centered around ""Amy"". a young woman that has been hurt badly by a man or men and is never wanting to ever be in a relationship again. She meets ""Kenny"", who listens to her and is sweetly sensitive to her. But, as the film goes on, the viewer learns that Kenny has not been completely honest with Amy and what transpires after that is pretty brutal, dark and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart!",1437696000,3,493,4.428571428571429
7306966,4,B0109ODDTG,"Bold, eerie, and darkly haunting, FELT is a brutally nihilistic journey through the life of a cynical young woman disenchanted with love and the world around her. Though slow-paced and meager in providing any discernible plot, FELT succeeds as an unparalleled exploration of feminism, sexuality, and the bleakness of human existence. FELT probably also holds the record for the most fake penis, vaginas, and fetus Hitlers ever shown on film. Definitely not one for the easily offended.",1437696000,3,485,5.311688311688312
8721704,2,B0109ODDTG,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Felt""

1. I respect this movie for trying a unique approach to the subject of rape culture.

2. Unfortunately, this mumblecore psychodrama is too slow and obvious to really be effective.

3. It's about a girl named Amy, who has survived some kind of unnamed sexual trauma, and who invents some rather disturbing ways to deal with it. She's obsessed with penis imagery, and develops a couple of alternate personalities.

4. It was directed by Jason Banker, who made the oddly effective Toad Road. He's a talented filmmaker, but this movie feels like a college film project, which also makes it a little pretentious.

5. The character of Amy is played by a woman named Amy Everson. She has said she drew on her own personal experiences for her role.

6. The main problem with the movie is how unrealistic it is. People would not act that way in real life, especially when reacting to Amy's increasing downward spiral.

7. There's a ""shocking"" ending that is hinted at for most of the movie, so it's about as shocking as a dead battery. It also would never happen that way.

8. The final 30 seconds of the film would have worked better in the middle of the movie. But by the time the story gets to Amy's core issue, it's over.

9. There is a good movie in here somewhere. But it's hidden under a lot of random conversations and weird behavior that don't advance the story. So it ends up sabotaging its own agenda.",1451779200,2,1439,4.525096525096525
8721705,5,B0109ODDTG,"An important movie. Very raw, but absolutely cutting (!) to truth.",1449964800,2,66,5.090909090909091
8721706,5,B0109ODDTG,"Felt is by no standard an average film. The film is mumble-to-the-core, but if you can embrace this method of delivery, there is plenty to absorb and discuss here.

The plot is fairly straightforward - struggling to cope with trauma in an exploitative, male-dominated society, an artist (Amy Everson) creates male costumes to adorn herself with. Amy is falling in deep with the mentality of ""If you can't beat them, join them"" until she meets a guy who might just be the perfect, safe counterpart.

In and of itself, that's a great starting place for a movie, and it sounds fairly straightforward on paper. But because the film is improvised (entirely) by the lead actress Felt never feels predictable. Amy may be crass, she may be broken, but she is refreshingly honest and sincere. Ive never - and youve never - seen a performance quite like this.

For me, Felt walked a fine line between rational inevitability and panicked concern about where it was going. Needless to say, the ending feels like the natural culmination of everything that preceded it.

Its brilliant, sophisticated work by Amy Everson. I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next.",1447113600,,1160,4.843434343434343
8721707,3,B0109ODDTG,"It's a great movie up until the end.  Not that I don't like the end.  I think it's a bit uncalled for and overkill.  The main storyline is funny, yet unsettling from time to time.  You'll feel uncomfortable from time to time, but that's the aim of the actors and filmmaker, or so it seems.  This movie should most likely have gotten more stars but I felt that the ending attacked all men in general... and not for the reasons they should be attacked but for some passive-aggressive reason or possibly transferred aggression.  It's still good though.",1445817600,,549,4.608247422680412

8721709,3,B0109ODDTG,"FELT is one of those films I have a hard time reviewing.  Part of me liked the film, while part of me did not.  I don't usually state such things up front when I write a review, but I feel you need to know what you're in for if you watch this one.  On the surface, FELT comes across as a rape-revenge flick; but when you dig deeper, you feel like you're being preached at.  Granted, the message is a good onehowever, I didn't feel any entertainment satisfaction when the movie ended.  In short, this film did not do much for me.

I know Im not supposed to judge a book (or a movie) by its cover, but the DVD imagery for FELT suggests a film experience similar to I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  I mean, a picture of two hands holding a pair of open scissors right above a crotch is definitely a serious metaphor, right?  Sadly, this is not the case.

FELT is shot well and looks good onscreen for the most part.  Some of the cinematography is a bit shakier than I normally care for, but Im always willing to overlook that in a lower-budget film.  Strangely, I couldn't peg what kind money this film had to work with; it looks higher end on some levels, but then it regresses sometimes into cheaper territory.

The acting is very good, with newcomer Amy Everson delivering a solid performance.  I understand this is her debut, and she does a wonderful job in the role.  As this film is based on personal experiences in her life, Im sure it was a labor of love for her in the portrayal.

The story in FELT is where I find the true problems.  Its justweird.  Amy creates costumes for different personas to try and escape the serious issues in her life.  She even goes to far as to create a fake penis, which she wears around.  But theres no real cohesion to the film.  It feels jumbled to me, and as such, I had a difficult time pinpointing what emotion to feel in each scene.

I cant really give FELT a positive or negative recommendation.  Its just one of those films thatis.  Take it for what it is, or take it symbolically; I suppose the choice is truly up to the viewer.  The film is available now in a variety of formats if you choose to take a look.",1441670400,,2144,4.224137931034483
8721710,4,B0109ODDTG,"It takes a twisted soul to understand this movie, but sadly I do. It's a bit on the weird side despite the deeper meaning. Regardless, I enjoyed this movie.",1441584000,,156,4.413793103448276

8721712,5,B0109ODDTG,"A thoughtful exploration of the traumatic impacts of sexual assault & navigating a world that is hostile towards and exploitative of women. Very artistic, with interesting visuals and symbolism. Don't read the reviews. Watch it for yourself.",1441238400,3,241,5.54054054054054
