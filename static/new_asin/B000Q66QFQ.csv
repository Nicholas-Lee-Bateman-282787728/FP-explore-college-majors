2831692,4,B000Q66QFQ,"I thought this documentary was quite well done. It was hard to watch at times, as they do show some quick flash footage shots from the actual death video (the audio was more difficult to endure...had to fast forward thru that...not for the squeamish).  Like most people, when I heard the news of Ken Pinyan's death, I was disgusted, astounded, shocked, and saddened. Zoophilia is such a taboo subject, and how someone can take the love of animals to such a horrific extreme is impossible for me to understand. The film makers do make an effort to explore zoophilia from the perspectives of those intimately involved in this case (Pinyan's cronies).

There is a poignant interview in the middle of the movie with one of the actors who portrays a cop in the film. He talks about the tragedy that Pinyan bled to death, and we should not forget that he was a father and had a young son. It's hard to imagine being such a slave to those kind of desires, but the interviews with Pinyan's friends did help shed some light.",1199836800,2,1015,4.540983606557377
2831693,3,B000Q66QFQ,"Many people were probably very angry upon reaching the end of Zoo when they realized that they had not just watched a documentary, they had watched an art house film deceptively packaged as a documentary.  Zoo eschews all standards of documentary filming such as factual content or video interviews, and instead strives to amaze viewers with flashy cinematography, a haunting musical score, and existential self-referential segments that have little or no connection with the subject matter of the documentary.  The potential audience for this film should be warned ahead of time that it provides few solid facts about the events in question, sheds no new light on the subject of bestiality, and fails to provide any insight into why human beings would choose to make love with animals.

Zoo is nominally about the events leading up to Kenneth Pinyan's death due to a perforated colon when he engaged in anal intercourse with an Arabian stallion on videotape, as well as the individuals in Pinyan's life who encouraged or were at least indifferent to his interest in bestiality.  The word ""nominally"" may be giving Zoo too much credit, as it never even provides Pinyan's name, instead solely using his online moniker ""Mr. Hands"".  None of the individuals associated with Pinyan, from the group of people who identify themselves as living the zoo lifestyle that he met with regularly to engage in acts of bestiality, to his ex-wife and child, or even the police and prosecutors involved in the aftermath of his death, are ever shown on screen.  Director Robinson Devor choose to use actors to create reenactments of events coupled with the occasional voiceover from audio interviews with a scant few people willing to talk about the issue.  These audio tracks and reenactments do not even constitute the bulk of the film, which would have been acceptable if they gave any decent information.  The vast majority of Zoo is simply long trailing shots of scenery or people matched with odd color schemes or eerie music.  If these non-essential segments were all edited out, Zoo's runtime would be cut down from 80 minutes to somewhere around 30 minutes.  There is no denying that Devor has a great talent for camera work and editing, but his talent is not suited to making documentaries.

Devor is so obsessed with producing a specific mood and theme, to the complete detriment of the ""plot"", that he might as well be directing an Italian giallo.  Halfway through the film the actor who portrays a police officer is shown in front of an entirely white background while he talks about his reaction to being asked to act in the film that he is currently acting in.  Occasionally throughout this monologue the screen flashes black, leaving a white ghost trail of the actor's silhouette.  This sort of ploy crosses the line from artsy to self indulgent, especially considering that the monologue has only the most tenuous of connections to Pinyan or the zoo lifestyle.  Perhaps Devor was trying to show that a subject as bizarre as animal love and the men who would risk potential death to take part in it could not successfully be explained by a straight forward exposition of events, but instead required a broader look at people and their environments in general that requires multiple viewings to really sink in.

Looking for an avant garde or artsy film to blow your mind with odd camera angles and off the wall color schemes?  Look no further than Zoo.  Those who actually wanted to learn something about Kenneth Pinyan or the mindset of people who would engage in such deviant acts can pass on this one.",1199577600,40,3601,4.885057471264368
2831694,2,B000Q66QFQ,"It's amazing how a film with such an interesting subject - the infamous ""Mr. Hands"" horse love video where a guy is loved to death by a stallion - could be so boring. The facts we know are some guy's got together for a weekend of fellowship and horse loving, but ZOO never goes any farther than that. There are a few audio interview clips from three of the participants told over vague, Errol Morris-channeled reenactments but that's it! Where are the interviews with psychologists, human sexuality experts, police, family members, hell anybody that could shed some light on why a person would sink to the level of not only being penetrated by a two foot horse dong, but actually going through the trouble of finding like-minded perverts, getting together and filming it?

Very disappointing. The only interesting things I learned from this 76 minute snoozer was Mr. Hands had a cast of the horse's wang in his apartment and that one of the miniature horses on the ranch was trained to suck another horse's ping ding. What's wrong with people? It's a good thing the aliens in THE ABYSS didn't see the Mr. Hands video instead of Ed Harris sacrificing himself to save his wife or we'd all be dead right now!!!",1191888000,10,1207,4.666666666666667
2831695,2,B000Q66QFQ,"I've always thought there had to be more.  Ever since the breaking news of Kenneth Pinyan's death, I have never liked the treatment his story was given.  Either the object of tasteless jokes or scathing condemnation, his death has left a void that needed to be filled.  Mostly, famed director Robinson Devor's documentary, 'Zoo,' doesn't do much to fill that void, but maybe no documentary can.

Mostly a reenactment, 'Zoo' traces back the account by actors who go to the facility where guests would engage in bestiality with stallions at a stable just outside of Seattle.  Hooking up via the anonymity of the Internet, Pinyan (bka ""Mr. Hands"") and others from many regions joined up to spend time with one of the prized horses.  Using eerie, low-ebbed synthesizer music, the film has a lurid quality as it unveils alienated men who bond through tequila and space exploration videos, making their way later solo to pair off with horses often in the middle of the night.  Much of the photography is meant to touch on the aesthetics of the environs and equestrian beauty, but the analysis of the human aftermath is few and far between.  One of the better aspects touches on the profile of the men:  Varying in socio-economic and religious backgrounds, all of them seem tragically alone.

Much of the footage focuses on Pinyan who died one night after an encounter ruptured his colon.  As the news headlines flashed across, it became one of those tragic, novelty human interest stories.  Devor survey's some of those reactions.  Anyone from CNN to Rush Limbaugh is given space, but then they go to some witnesses.  Part of the testimony is about the behavior of the key people; some of the rest of the testimony has experts going over evidence of alleged abuse to the horses.

While I usually think it is the execution rather than the subject matter that wins for a documentary, I was looking for more insight.  In place of so many animal experts analyzing the alleged abuse to the stallions in a nonconsensual setup, it would have been better to have psychologists analyze the human situation.  Besides retracing the events before his death, they show the incremental steps as charges came to the fore by law enforcement who didn't have anti-bestiality laws in place in the state of Washington.  As the stable manager relates, some people came by dropping religious ""tracks"" at his doorstep.  The best scene is when the stable manager (played by an actor) opens up and honestly admits his inner thoughts after the whole incident.  As much as I love animals, I must confess, I couldn't understand their emphasis on the animals' potential post trauma.  If I lived near there, I would have left a pie on his doorstep, instead of a track, coaxing and encouraging them back to the human race.

While it isn't fair to expect ""Just the facts ma'am,"" the presentation leaves some huge, gaping holes.",1190937600,23,2889,4.817444219066937
2831696,3,B000Q66QFQ,"If they hadn't spent so much footage on seemingly endless tracking shots of highways and byways, the filmmakers could have gone more into depth as to what causes bestiality urges in some people, the online communities they are involved in, and more.  As it stands, the documentary is not very insightful in the long run.  It feels as if it's only the first chapter in a series that will probably not be continued.",1190851200,19,413,4.6438356164383565

I was blown away by the nearly surreal, poetic beauty of this work, and I agree that, while the subject matter is quite upsetting, this film somehow transcends it's subject matter. This movie is not for ""bungling"" frat boys who want to laugh at everything. It is for people who are true fans of film art, and the limitlessness of the form.

2831719,4,B000Q66QFQ,"The film attempts to show ""ordinary"" people who happen to have a sexual desire for animals. The film makes every attempt to humanize the characters in the film. The idea of loving animals deeper than the rest of us, and that love resulting in sex is by every definition wrong and evil. Maybe the filmakers were trying to show us how depraved inter species sex really is...but I didn't get that from it. You know ""love"" isn't equal to having a huge horse penis unnaturaly rammed up your...welll you know the rest.  Like many untold stories (pedophilia amongst powerful people...I know another discussion), these people actually deserve to be treated like evil, immoral monsters that they are.

2831720,2,B000Q66QFQ,"This documentary is really just a series of narrations and interviews with people surrounding the Enumclaw horse sex case dubbed over dramatisations. What results is a very static and shallow view of what led to Mr Hands' death. The documentary would have done better to include some experts to analyse bestiality or his cause of death. To me, this documentary simply covered the timeline of events with some events shuffled around to make it less boring. Also, the director went completely over the top with the ominous soundtrack and dark, meandering shots of the farm and of the men. No idea what he was trying to achieve there, seeing as the cinematography could not have been more out of place.",1320883200,,699,4.833333333333333
2831721,4,B000Q66QFQ,"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders.",1312934400,3,1027,5.071005917159764
2831722,3,B000Q66QFQ,"the movie is one of a kind however, they spend more time talking about the act of what this man did rather than the case itself. being a documentary, i was surprisingly eager to watch the film, but in the end was kind of disappointed. it still filled my craving for the curiosity i had with this whole thing but it could've taken some different approaches along the way",1294617600,,369,4.36231884057971
2831723,3,B000Q66QFQ,"This movie affected me in two ways.
One. The zoo folks mentality. They sound so reasonable in their behavior. Loving animals ""just felt right"". Ok, fine, not to judge the absolute conduct or their behavior, but so many people have justified their actions on the ""just felt right"" paradigm. Charles Manson's followers or Hitler's would be in that bunch. And lesser folk's with bad proclivities, like child molesters. But were these people in Zoo really on that level as molesters? The animals were consenting. Consenting in that if they weren't, they wouldn't have obliged their human recipients. Disgusting to me perhaps, but not necessarily criminal or evil, or is it?

Two. The movie has very little actual footage of any participants, only a brief glimpse of Mr. Hands indulging in his chosen proclivity. The rest is arty reenactment. It's well shot, cool and all but its not suited to a serious documentary. To its credit tho Its much more well done than something you'd see on cable. The score by Paul Matthew Moore is excellent, being effective, somewhat ambient electronica, and the rhythm of the movie is hypnotic with more than a few good moments. But its just not a great movie.",1265587200,2,1188,4.881188118811881
2831724,2,B000Q66QFQ,I thought this was going to be more of a professional documentary on bestiality and their emotional attraction to animals instead of bonding to people.

2831725,2,B000Q66QFQ,"A horrible misfire of a film. An obvious attempt at a thought-provoking, meditative Errol Morris-like documentary, this film fails repeatedly. The main problem is that the film is filled with inane, impertinent, irrelevant and, worst of all, uninteresting information. I had to call it quits shortly after the interview with a man who played Cop #1 in something (it's never explained). Cop #1 sits on a stool on an all-white soundstage and tells a story about how he had helped a softball opponent onto a stretcher that would take him to the same hospital where the main subject of this documentary had died. My jaw dropped at this interview's complete and obvious irrelevance to anything. Combine this with a detailed description of the drinks these people sometimes served at their parties(?!?!) and you realize this film, as short as it is, did not have enough interesting information to relay. There is however, some beautiful aerial footage, but this one aspect does not make up for one of the most uninspired, unintelligible and uninformative documentaries I've ever seen.",1260403200,,1078,5.096045197740113

2831737,1,B000Q66QFQ,"The producer was on a budget and, as a result, employed a barn in place of a penthouse.  A boeing employee instead of a New York stock broker.  Due to further budget cuts, the casting director was unable to hire Kim Basinger and instead settled for an unemployed horse.  Mister Ed was retired.  For eccentric people unable to relate to the human race, there was an abundant supply in Washington state.  The film and music created the same dreamy atmosphere of Nine & a Half Weeks and supplied a rather thoughtful mood for those embarking on alternative lifestyles.  Hide your pets, though.  These people are serious.  After all, they're from Washington state.  Even the folks in the Ozarks would blush.  For cutting edge depravity, Washington state is the trend setter.  It is the first time I would say, ""not a nice place to raise pets.""  The Washingtonians who participate in this reprobate lifestyle dub in the narration that ""they're not bad people because they don't hurt anybody.""  They neglect to consider that morality is based on, not just our relationship to other people, but to our relationship to God.  God said quite clearly that ""Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.""  Leviticus 18:23.  I think it noteworthy that after death of one of these ""zoos,"" one guy turned to Buddhism for comfort.  Trust me, meaningless paganism is not going to prevent God's judgment on your soul who practice such things.  As Jesus said, ""Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.""  Matthew 25:41.  Buddhism is just a lie designed by the evil one to make you feel comfortable in your sinful guilt.  I thought it was astonishing to hear the woman at the end dub into the narration that she is beginning to understand it.  Understand what?  This is depraved sin, pure and simple.  Just as they conditioned the public to accept promiscuity, and then conditioned the public to accept people of the same gender with each other, now they are operating on this sick theme.  As Jesus said, """"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man.""  Luke 17:26-27.",1246147200,6,2263,4.651515151515151
2831738,2,B000Q66QFQ,"This movie""Zoo"" was about a subject that is in my opinion disturbing.people who love and have sex with animals. I watched it on IFC one day when bored. It was like a train wreck you don't want to watch but you're curiosity makes you take a peek.
Seeing as the subject matter was so intense and so perverse plus it was unrated I expected the full monty. I don't see why they tip toed around everything and made innuendos,It was a bit hard to follow because allot was spoken in a sort of code that I suppose only a participant of this sort of behavior would understand.
WE know it was about a man that died after complications from having sex with a horse..even when they showed the death certificate then blocked out intercourse with a horse which was on it,only showing something about a horse and then colon..The end was really weird showing a naked man in a field of horses rubbing up against one of them and whispering in it's ear.
It really weird ed me out and I'm hard to freak out..
It left me feeling like I had just watched a film about aliens, these couldn't possibly be functioning human beings. after this film I was curious and I saw the actual video of the act that later killed Mr hands,his real name ""Kenneth Pinyan"" and I almost fainted.

2831742,3,B000Q66QFQ,"I remember first hearing about this man who died from internal damage after having sex with a horse. I clearly remember thinking, uncharitably, ""One less pervo."" Yeah, not nice. But the idea of such an act is so repulsive, that one assumes the person is damaged and, in some strange way, has become ""less than human."" While repulsion, disgust, and horror is natural, I think it is unwise and unkind to dehumanize men (and women) who do acts that seem to ""beast-ti-fy"" them, in a literal sense.

This documentary allows for the humanity of the group of men who gathered regularly to indulge in said repulsive sexual preference. It has a very peaceful eerieness, a sort of pastoral idyll gone wrong feel. Some scenes are very powerful--the man running frantically with a pailful of bestiality recordings across the greenness of a field in the Pacific Northwest (one DVD dropped for police to find has the name of the horse with whom the victim met his demise); the men walking in the dimmest of lights, on the way, silently, to the barn; the strange, subdued, darkened partying of the men in the house where they had their meet-ups, featureless, moving heavily; the actor playing Ken Pinyan shirtless in a stall, silent and expectant, and in another scene, quietly holding his son's hand in an observatory. Lots of beautiful, somewhat melancholic shots of the Seattle area and Enumclaw and Mt Rainier, too.

We get a very clear sense of loneliness, alienation, need, and obssession, but it's all so fluid and quiet that it's almost poetic. Which is very freaky, given what we know is ultimately going on among these men with their dark urges--they get regularly sodomized by stallions. They record it. They share this obession online.

But the documentary, while doing an amazing job of setting mood and showing the loneliness of those involved in this taboo, the difficulty they have of actually connecting in normal relationships, also shows that this perversion is what allows them to connect to each other. Perhaps the only thing that links them regularly to people.

Where the major failures lie: 1. The missing parts from experts that might give us some insight (historically and contemporarily) about what leads to this sort of obsession/perversion/orientation/fetish/whatever. This man died because he had this urge he could not control. What might be at the heart of it. I left the film knowing not a whit more about zoophilia. 2. Its the lack of any insight into the taboo act itself or its repercussions to the wider circle--friends (if any), coworkers, and, above all, family. I found myself greatly sympathizing after the film was over for the ex-wife and son--who must be dealing still with the awfulness of what happened.

We're never explictly shown (thank God) or hear described what killed Ken Pinyan, but the death certificate is shown in a few passing cuts, where we see that the sigmoid colon was ruptured. The mind reels at that moment, thinking of that. It's a bit much. The imagination simply does not want to go there, and yet it seems to be helpless to do so. Ugh.

This film does serve one purpose. It's a gentle treatment of a very ungentle desire, and it balances the cruel jokes and snickerings that followed Mr. Pinyan's demise. I may have had an uncharitable reaction to hearing the news, but it enver occurred to me to start cracking jokes about it. It was only after seeing ZOO that I came online and realized the extent of the mocking and scorning. Wow.

So, this is a small look into what happened that includes audio-interviews with three of the parties involved--two of them zoophiliacs, one the horse rescuer who came to take away the animals owned by the victim. While I am not fully convinced of the protestations that this is about loving animals (seems to me it's more about screwing them/being screwed by them, not actually loving them or treating them with dignity), I think we can't really address the things that go wrong in the human psyche/heart/soul/mind unless we allow people to talk about it and share their views.

So, here is something of the perspective, desires, and the loneliness of the zoophiliac. Sanitized and beautified, but at least addressed. We won't admire these men. We might wanna walk away from them as fast as we can. But, it makes it harder to just think of Ken Pinyan as an internet joke.",1231545600,10,4359,4.818181818181818
2831743,3,B000Q66QFQ,"I always find myself drawn to films that challenge our taboos. Little known director Robinson Devor may have known that many movie-goers do the same, and instead of exploiting his subject matter like so many documentarians do, he literally removes any sense of the provoking stigmas associated with the kind of subject matter he explores in Zoo.  Interesting approach, because Zoo is an overview of the death of Ken Pinyan, who engaged in receptive penetrative intercourse with a full grown stallion on film, and died from it.  Unbeknownst to this particular viewer, this was a fairly well covered story in the Seattle area and even influenced laws regarding lascivious actions using animals in the state of Washington, which were almost nonexistent.

Devor's film covers the story in a vague but provoking way.  The atmosphere of the film is eerie but only a rare few of the landscape shots are oddly effective, albeit not incredibly impressive.  In addition, the film touches base with quite a few people who were there and knew Pinyan personally, but unfortunately it is done using mostly audio, and that in turn means more mediocre photography.  Still, Devor makes humans out of these people when I'd imagine the media wasn't so kind.  By the same token, what they do and how Pinyan died is exactly what it is.

The nature of this bizarre subculture is hard to sympathize with and I'm not sure Devor and his team can be accused of doing so, but they still stare unflinchingly into this void.  I found the film strangely fascinating and the style it was created with suggests that the filmmaker felt the same way.  It's an uncomfortable but clean peak into a world many don't want to even know about.  The film garnered moderate praise for its selection at both Cannes and Sundance, but the subject matter alone obviously prevents it from getting further exposure.  At the very least, I'm curious what Devor and writer Charles Mudede do next.

Of course I read the description, and sometimes it's hard to be a curious fellow, but I really wanted to see what this was all about regardless of ratings.  I confess that the general topic of bestiality is something that interests me, but particularly from a psychological level.  I've read a few other books on aberrant sexual behavior, probably one of the most well known is ""The 120 Days of Sodom"" and while this is not a scientific book, it does have a great deal to read into and think about without the bias of some scientists.  I've also read ""Rogue Messiah"" which relates extreme religious cults with a penchant for outrageous overpowered sexual behavior.  I guess I'm saying this because I don't want to be labeled as something I'm not and pointing out that the subject in general is something that interests me.

That being said, I was rather disappointed in the documentary.  I had never heard of this case until I stumbled upon this film and I think it's presented in a way that requires people to have a decent amount of foreknowledge about the case.  For someone like me it felt kind of disjointed and I really don't like the way it's been kind of thrown together.  I would've preferred a solid fifteen minute introduction into what prompted this documentary, going over the case and news etc.  However, they don't do that, instead they stick to this clandestine ominous feel throughout the documentary with a strange soundtrack that lends to this feeling.  Something is going on?  Something very abnormal by society's standards... what could it be?  This is how it feels to watch this.  Towards the end I learned what happened and I think I know why they filmed it this way.  Basically it feels like this film tries to engender sympathy for the Zoo's that were chastised for their involvement even though Mr. Hands, who died, was fully consenting to what he did with the horses.

While I think they failed on all fronts to make me want to go hang out with these fellows and be friends, I am glad it gave the subject neutral treatment overall.  I have actually gone to further lengths to peruse some forums that cater to this kind of interest, for as the documentary points out, the internet is what brought everyone together.  Anyway, one thing struck me as I was reading through the forum; there are many that take this as a sexual orientation.  I have to be honest, this never occurred to me before.  I always considered that it followed down a path of fetishism, which is something I can identify with a little more.  But in that form the objects or actions are what a person responds to, a lot of these people speak of love as if to a regular human mate.  Personally, I'm neutral on this subject, to be perfectly frank.  I don't care if you think it's sick or disgusting, many people say this about homosexuality or transvestites.

Based on a lot of things I've read and seen, I cannot deny the overwhelming motivator that is gratification of this sort.  I have to try and see this documentary for what it is and try to see things from the world view of these people if I can ever hope to grasp some concept, and I have to question myself.  If this was the only way I could ever actually have real pleasure in this world would it be worth the risk?  Sure, you'll naturally go through motions of trying out the normal stuff society deems acceptable, but what if that's not enough and you keep searching.  Eventually you end up in a very lonely state and the need builds up until you have to follow through.  It's not necessarily insanity, it's just that you know what you need is out there and it's in your power to obtain it and perhaps share in that lovingly.  So at that point you just weigh the risk.  Is it better to be shunned by society for something that makes you feel loved or not?  While I'm not about to go track down a local barnyard personally, I do understand to a degree, because even desires that may be considered tame are still shunned by society.  Even bondage, which has become more readily practiced today, is still considered, by and large, an abnormality by the greater populace.  Many people shun this, but as the concept becomes more and more mentioned people become desensitized to the subject.  I'm not a psychologist, but as others have mentioned, I wish they would have included some commentary from one on this documentary, because I would really like to know the answer to ""is this a legitimate sexual orientation?""  Society will yell a resounding ""no!"" and the Zoo's may yell a resounding ""yes!""  I have to admit, society can be wrong, it was wrong that the world was flat now wasn't it?

I know I went off tangent, but I couldn't help it, this documentary leaves way too many questions.  Sure I know what happened about the case.  I now know there is an animal abuse law on the books in Washington, in case this should happen again.  But what I don't know is what really makes the human tick on this level.  I don't care if you think it's wrong, or immoral, people are doing it.  People are not only doing it, they are finding it a great pleasure and do it without regret.  They take great care of their animals and love them dearly as you or I would love a spouse or a child, as the film states.  I still want to hear some theories on why!  But no one ever asked them that question, no one even tries to speculate here.  It did get an extra half star for staying neutral on the topic and not condemning the people, instant condemnation doesn't necessarily give you honest answers and I doubt these people would've allowed themselves to be interviewed if they were being demonized.  For that I have nothing but respect for the makers of this.",1214784000,5,6046,4.542513863216266

Subject matter, seems very obscure, an something I wouldn't even be curious about, at all. It seems to me film makers would have something more to produce then something as off the wall, tasteless, and IMO, just plain evil!! I'm pretty sure, most belief systems would agree!!
If this movie came out on syndicated tv, I'm glad I don't spend money to watch idiotic, tasteless trash as this sounds like!!

Although I cannot for the life of me understand how someone could have ever thought that being skewered through the back door by a stallion was anything other than a really bad idea. Apparently it was not his first rodeo either, as evidenced by the notorious video circulating which is not, as I understand it, of the fatal encounter itself. Interestingly, no laws other than trespassing were broken, something of an embarrassment to the Washington legislature, who quickly moved to make bestiality illegal in their fair state.

8194410,2,B000Q66QFQ,"From the weird Twilight Zone-ish music at the beginning to its morally ambiguous conclusions, this is one strange piece of filmmaking, not even a documentary by most standards but a sort of film meditation on what it means to be a human outcast. This is all very well, but it's so slow-moving and contains so little topic-related material in its endless voiceovers that it soon becomes frustrating to watch. I must admit that there were a number of places in which I didn't even know what they were talking about. There was an edging away from the subject matter which may have been done for effect. But the extremely slow pacing and endless drone of monotonous/spooky music seemed to counter the filmmaker's attempt to be morally neutral. Why play spooky music if this is (supposedly) an activity these men should have the right to pursue? To argue endlessly about whether a stallion ""gave consent"" to have sex with a man is ludicrous. Laws against bestiality need to be in place, not just for horses but for ALL animals. We can't have certain laws for horses and not for dogs - it's completely ridiculous and misses the point. If there are no laws, it's perfectly legal for a man to have anal sex with a small dog, telling himself it's OK because the dog enjoys it. Anti-bestiality laws also prevent a zoophile from rupturing his colon by having sex with a horse.  It protects him from his own worst impulses. If sex with animals is off the table, which it should be, such absurd categories won't exist and everyone, even those who say they ""love"" animals, will be protected. But the film took a morally vague and mushy attitude, the creepy music and darkness at odds with the attempt to ""understand"". In its own way it's a highly-judgemental film because it heavily veils the whole subject as if it is just too horrible to contemplate. This may have been an attempt to avoid the guffawing that the subject provokes in some people, but there is nothing funny about a socially-alienated man dying horribly because he had sex with an animal. Some taboos need to be there. The incest taboo seems to be rocking on its foundations, and some people (including innumerable internet cults) defend pedophilia so long as it is ""pleasurable"" to the child. Sex should not be a weapon or something that has to be cloaked in a cult-like atmosphere. The film could be defended because it ""got people thinking"", but the conclusion I came to - from my gut - was ""some things are just wrong."" Ultimately, I pushed this movie away from me because I could not watch such an even-handed portrayal of an abomination.",1448323200,,2596,4.680525164113786
