7966860,5,B00006BT7V,"A really funny comedy with some real hotties (Joan Severance and Tanya Roberts), plenty of nudity and as the icing on the cake, an actually pretty good plot! I've had this one for a long time and watch it every so often. It's not often that you find a movie good enough to watch twice, let alone over and over again!",1400803200,3,316,4.19672131147541
7966861,5,B00006BT7V,"Normally, I rarely watch comedies. I rented this film years ago on VHS. It was the unrated version. It deals with infertility. The methods that were used to deal with this problem were absolutely hilarious. Dom Deluise was appropriately cast as the fertility Doctor. I thoroughly enjoyed this little romp, and highly reccomend it to anyone just looking for a good time as it is a perfect escape. Charlie S.",1167436800,11,406,4.814285714285714
