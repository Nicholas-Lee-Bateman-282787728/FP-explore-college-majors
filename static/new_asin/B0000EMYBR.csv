1937878,4,B0000EMYBR,"This documentary was a wonderful piece of work chock full of amazing interviews, photos, and vintage footage that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the legendary black artist movement. I enjoyed this documentary thoroughly because not only was it a wonderful political account, it was also an incredible history of early black cinema as well. This documentary is a must for anyone with a general interest in early to mid 20th century black history.

The big problem with this dvd is it takes full use of an irritating DRM technology called UOP prohibition that will stop you from fast forwarding certain parts of the dvd. Commercials, logos, etc. all unskippable, you can't even use the stop button. The only way to stop the player is to shut it all the way off with the power button. I was really, really surprised to see this nasty drm on such a great dvd. I have other BET Starz dvds and they aren't as annoying.",1243814400,6,931,4.608433734939759
1937879,5,B0000EMYBR,"This short documentary is powerful. By sharing this video with others, small but significant change is possible in this still-racist society. I highly recommend it.",1222992000,6,164,5.6
1937880,4,B0000EMYBR,"This documentary shows that McCarthy and his House Unamerican Activities Committee went after Black artists, just as it did to whites.

The documentary starts with Morgan Freeman, imitating many other PBS narrators, pretending like he's reading a book and then speaking to the camera.  This introduction had me rolling on the floor.  This documentary features Harry Belafonte and the elderly actress from the TV series ""Amen.""  It also includes Ossie Davis (surprisingly, sans Ruby Dee) before he passed.  This may bring a tear to the eyes of his fans.  This work does an effective job of showing how any progressive Black artist interested in Civil Rights could be misconstrued and punished as a supposed Communist.  Urban Works, which usually produces pop cultural modern pieces, did a great job in venturing out into this historic, serious endeavor.

There are many scenes of Black actors during the early days of TV and films.  Perhaps viewers should watch this documentary alongside the many documentaries on the history of Black Hollywood.",1118102400,9,1045,5.209580838323354
1937881,4,B0000EMYBR,"I have not yet recieved it but I just stumbled across it on television. If you are interested in this Era or you are an artist or interested in the arts this is a great piece. It's essential to know the struggles artists as a whole went through during the Blacklist and often you never hear about the African American experience during that time period. This film includes accounts from famous African American artist, several of which are still alive. This piece opened my eyes. The only downfall I could say was that the film was a little short and like with many things you don't get to see the names more than once. But otherwise I think it's great resource. Buy this film!",1116892800,3,677,4.467741935483871

8002164,5,B0000EMYBR,"This was very informative and well done. It could have been a little less ""diplomatic"" but it seems it was created for mainstream TV. It should be viewed by all and shown again on cable. It made me want to learn more about each person in the film.",1447200000,,247,4.166666666666667

8002167,5,B0000EMYBR,"I never realized how much of the black acting community was impacted by the ""witch hunt"" for communist activities. Some of the background stories are simply heart-breaking when you realize that these victims were targeted and destroyed simply for being involved in civil liberty activities. African American's were specifically vulnerable and without resource to fight back against slanderous accusations. Talented, intelligent human beings were barred from their professions and very few were ever able to recover what was lost. The actors who were black-listed were not told how or why or by whom - they simply were never able to work in their fields anymore. The clandestine ""word of mouth"" denigrations were intensely disconcerting to hear because there was no way to face or fight this nameless THING that was destroying your career. Special telephone lines to call and check for whether or not an actor was approved to work. Even actors who managed to have their names removed from the list ran into the ADDITIONAL problem of working when many of their peers could not and, because of this, they became suspect by their colleagues. Heinous! The sheer unadulterated ugliness of the events in this documentary should not be forgotten nor the way it was carried out in every single branch of government and business. To forget that these things happened, the impact it had on the lives of innocent people, and the unmasked terror that this behavior generated should be required reading in every high school and college prep class less an entire GENERATION of young people miss the lessons to be learned from those days. Never repeating this type of organized and clandestined terrorism should be the goal of every person who watches this video as well as becoming educated about how these destructive practices were orchestrated. Lastly, seeing the ROTTEN fruit that this particular ""tree"" produced was truly astounding. Thinking men and women in general need to be aware that this garbage HAS happened before and it could very well happen again if cautionary tales like this are not watched, studied and evaluated regularly and often.",1395964800,,2138,5.111428571428571

8002169,5,B0000EMYBR,IT'S UNUSUAL WE MOST OF THE TIME DON'T GET ENOUGH OF THE HISTORY AND PROPER INFO ON BLACK PEOPLE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. IT'S EVEN A DIFFERENT OCCASSION TO SEE ONE OF IF NOT MY NUMBER ONE ACTOR PICK TO BE NARRATING THIS PIECE OF EXCITING WORK.,1368144000,,250,4.340425531914893
8002170,5,B0000EMYBR,Very effective teaching tool in my teaching a course on the Mccarthy Era. The film evoked a great amount of interest and discussion,1358640000,,131,4.739130434782608
8002171,5,B0000EMYBR,"I absolutely love this film. It is very powerful showing how civil rights activism was conveniently smeared with communism. I have showed this to my US History classes for years and no matter what level (honors, regular, AP) they all love it. Paul Robeson is an American hero and it is a crime that he is virtually anonymous.",1344988800,,325,4.620689655172414
8002172,5,B0000EMYBR,"Another must own for any household.  Hopefully we have learned from our past (in more ways than one) and will never repeat it.  So many talented individuals, who were already penalized and held back because of their skin color and not abilities, were destroyed because of perceived connections with communism.  People of other ethnic groups also were perceived to have communistic ties and destroyed; however, not because of skin color.

This is a must see!!!

Again, we must never repeat the past.",1265155200,,498,5.024390243902439
