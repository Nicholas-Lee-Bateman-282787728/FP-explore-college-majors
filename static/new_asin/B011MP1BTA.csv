7337431,5,B011MP1BTA,"Margherita Buy plays a film director called Margherita. She is making a film about a factory dispute where the new owner wants to lay off part of the workforce. She gets her lead man from the US this is Barry Huggins (John Turturro) who is as easy to direct as it is to herd kittens. She is also dealing with the recent hospitalisation of her loving mother.
**Mild Plot Spoilers Ahead**
She is one of those women who are very driven and focussed and has not always noticed the details of those around her. As the film goes off the rails so does her mothers condition worsen and she starts to unravel who she really is as the events of the present tease out the mistakes of the past.

This is a film that relies on strong performances and I am happy to say it has them. The whole cast put their all into their roles resulting in a film that is believable, touching, moving and very personal. Anyone who has grieved will not help but be moved by the performances here and you will get to learn a bit about film making too. In Italian with a smattering of English and a bit of Latin this one is absolutely recommended.",1452038400,5,1115,4.2843601895734595
7337432,4,B011MP1BTA,"This is a very moving picture which I view as a character study. Nanni Morretti is a director I know from previous films and he appears in the film as a son of the mother of the title.  I also know Margherita Buy from an earlier  Italian film.  She's older here but still beautiful.  As a film director she plays a woman driven to succeed.  Unfortunately, the character of John Turturro's Barry doesn't work.  He's as irritating as he's supposed to be in the film.  One wonders why the role was created....to help sell the film?  It has won prizes.  The ending is touching.  The mother (Giulia Lazzarini) dies.  The actress expresses everything in suitable, subtle fas;hion.  I was very moved.",1483315200,3,693,4.636363636363637

8724673,2,B011MP1BTA,"'Mia Madre' never connects on the deep emotional levels the filmmaker is striving for and the result is a feeling of emptiness for the viewer.  John Turturro's presence is movie that is in mostly Italian is more of a distraction than a plus.  Turturro acts the heck out of his part, but the movie's sum of its parts don't add up to anything tangible.  The dying mother bit has been done to death, pun intended, but I wished the film went in a different direction.  This was a slog for me and not worth the time.  If you're a Turturro completist like I am then it's worth seeing him entertain.  Final Score:  ONE NOTE IF YOU WATCH THIS ON AMAZON:  The subtitles do not come on automatically.  You have to do them manually.",1513209600,,721,4.360902255639098
8724674,5,B011MP1BTA,"Very interesting to read these reviews - people loved it, or hated it - not much in between. I found myself engrossed from the start, growing fonder of each character with each passing scene. Like many films, relatability factors in strongly, and your opinion of the story will depend on where you are in life right now. Without being a cliche it touched a nerve that each of us will eventually face. Not overplayed, but very thoughful and thoroughly enjoyable.",1511568000,,461,4.775
8724675,5,B011MP1BTA,"Beautiful movie about life and loss of a mother. It shows how hard it is to accept a mother's decay for her children. It also shows the mother's confusion when she starts mixing memories and losing touch with reality. This movie is real and very touching.
Margherita Bui doesn't disappoint, and Nanni Moretti, director and actor in the movie, reflects on his work through his sister, who plays the part of a director. Turturro's performance is deep and entertaining. Also the actress who plays the elderly mother is very good.
I think all the negative reviews are because the movie is in Italian, without subtitles, and many reviewers complain they didn't understand the dialogues.",1510099200,,681,4.982456140350878

This was a paycheck movie for John Turturro. Must have traded his acting for a free trip to Italy. Terribly disappointed.",1489363200,2,296,4.823529411764706
