4048176,4,B00315I6DE,"This is a great documentary with some jaw dropping facts.  I watched it along side of ""What Hath Darwin Wrought"", and it was an amazing revelation to me.",1299628800,5,153,4.464285714285714
4048177,3,B00315I6DE,"I saw much of the film at a viewing at the church I attend. (You can watch the film in its entirety online). The film was tedious and repetitive and in some areas bordered on being conspiratorial . It relied too much on emotionalism and not enough on critical thinking. The film posits that Planned Parenthood and their supporters are white racist liberals whose agenda is to terminate the black race through birth control and abortion to control population growth. I don't agree with this premise entirely because one could argue that the mass incarceration of black men and this country' drug laws has had a much more devastating effect on destroying the black community than abortion, but I digress.
On to the weaknesses of the documentary...
One weakness of the film was it failure to acknowledge that black people in the early part of the 20th century, such as black women social clubs, W.E.B. DuBois, and MLK (who received an award from PP in 1966) supported abortion. The two biggest weaknesses was not addressing the reasons why black women have abortions and not providing a counter-argument to the contemporary justification for abortion. The documentary doesn't address the socioeconomic conditions (poverty, lack of access to health care, lack of education) that create unintended pregnancies among black women (who have the highest rates of unintended pregnancies than any other group) which lead many of them to consider abortion.
The film does not address the contemporary rationale that is used today justify the legalization of abortion, such as ""It's a woman's right to choose what she wants to do with her body;"" that abortion is a choice, albeit a difficult one, a woman has to make if is she is unable care and provide for a child because of her age and economic situation; and the big one-""in the horrific situation where a woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest why should that woman have to keep the baby?""  What are pro-lifers responses to that?
I believe that abortion is a great evil but even if every PP clinic in the US were to close today it still would not prevent women from seeking abortions. Until the socioeconomic status of black women and the rationales used to justify abortion change, we will not see progress on ending this great evil in our nation.",1298160000,13,2296,4.872122762148337
4048178,3,B00315I6DE,"I watched this film over at the house of a church member. I was struck by how many times all the speakers made the basic point, ""Planned Parenthood's plan is really planned genocide against the poor and people of color."" About 30 minutes into the video, I felt like, ""Okay, we get it."" It was so bad that I came online just to find out how many minutes this video was. With the amount of information packed into the video, all this information may have been better shortened to maybe an hour or at least broken into parts. By contrast, in spite of Michael Moore's films clearly having an agenda, I find them compelling. But the way the information was presented in this video, it had me taking a ton of notes to make sure these people really said and wrote what the film said they did. I learned to do this after watching the movie ""Hotel Rwanda."" I knew that this massacre couldn't have just happened in a vacuum, so I did research to find out what precipitated the violence.

Some of the information I didn't know and it helped that the documentary used a lot of original material. However, I follow the creed, ""Consider the source."" Every documentary has an agenda. But sometimes, you can make your point so strongly, that the other side ends up rejecting it, saying that you have too extreme of beliefs. Even my firmly pro-life mother dismissed some of the assertions of the film saying, ""Oh, that just sounds like one of those conspiracy theories."" Other works have had this problem too. I'm currently reading ""Lies My Teacher Told Me"" and I've read John Grisham's non-fiction book, ""The Innocent Man."" The authors made their positions clear but it seemed like every page had to hammer home the point.

Another critique I had was the main presenters seemed to get increasingly emotional in their delivery. Understandably, they're black and the suggestion of a campaign of black genocide should inspire emotion in them. But when facts are delivered, I want them delivered neutrally and calmly so you can make up your own mind. For an example, view ""Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery"" and listen to Angela Basset's narration. It's often interviewees that have the more compelling stories. I found myself more moved by the woman who spoke of being involuntarily sterilized as a teenager and the preacher at the end than I had at the presentations by the two narrators.

In short, I recommend this film with reservation because of it's length and it's heavy handed approach. I also think, in targeting it so much to the faith community, that it's probably not likely to be as effective and moving to the opposition. It's a shame that what makes the abortion issue so divisive is both sides on the debate make incideniary statements about the other, instead of focusing humanely and reasonably on the question, ""What do we, as a society do when a mother doesn't want to give birth to or raise her unborn child?""",1295740800,6,2932,4.711500974658869
4048179,2,B00315I6DE,"I thought I was purchasing a book; thus, I was very disappointed to receive the DVD, of which, I already have/had a copy.",1286150400,3,121,4.304347826086956
4048180,5,B00315I6DE,"Maafa 21 is an incredible exposure of Planned Parenthood.  I read a biography of its founder, Margaret Sanger, and found her to be a fanatic of population reduction.  What is very telling in her biography is her lack of interest in her own children.  Her primary concern was ""family planning"".  What we see now is Planned Parenhood's consistent efforts to exterminate minorities - genocide through ""family planning"" of blacks and hispanics.  Look where their ""clinics"" are.  All this information is in MAAFA 21.  It is a real eye opener.",1284163200,41,537,4.966292134831461
4048181,4,B00315I6DE,"Although this documentary could have benefited from some serious editing, it does a good job of connecting the dots in the oppression of black Americans through slavery, sterilization, birth control, and finally, abortion.  At times the presentation is tedious in its effort to present sufficient documentation to convince even the most skeptical viewer.  All-in-all, it presents a formidable case and is worth viewing.",1282176000,19,419,5.634920634920635
4048182,5,B00315I6DE,"This was an eye-opening experience. I viewed this dvd in the comfort of my office when no one else was there. OMG! There is pure evil out there and it walks, breathes, eats, sleeps and has families and can look as benign as you or I, but it is NOT!
If anyone has ANY reservations about the following issues being tied together: race, racism, raciality, EDUCATION, marriage, ABORTION, illegitmacy, birth control, legislated immorality, promiscuity, PERVERTED VIEW OF GOD, hip hop, birth rates, survival rates, culture of entitilement mentality, SFN disease (something for nothing) and a sundry of other issues; THIS dvd will quelch ALL doubt. There has been an agenda to get rid of the black race, especially here in America (duh!).
Get this dvd. View it alone, first, deal with your emotions and set your thoughts to paper so that you NEVER forget your initial thoughts after you turned the dvd player off. Then, invite your people over.
After you have this knowledge, decide what you'll do with it. I pray you organize and constructively fight the evil that is exposed in this dvd. God bless those who came together to make this!!! Bless they and their offspring forever more, God!!",1281398400,41,1183,4.861386138613861
4048183,5,B00315I6DE,"This movie contains many factual quotes from original sources including newspapers, government documents, phone conversations, and TV interviews.  It traces the eugenics movement in the U.S. and how this movement became the driving force for legalizing and allocating public funding for abortions in black communities.  One of the guest speakers is Dr. Martin Luther King's niece, Dr. Alveda King (who, herself, has had an abortion).  She is a strong voice of dissent and change regarding the abortion industry, and it's target: African Americans.  Strong connections are also linked between Margaret Sanger and Hitler who agreed on policies to target specific populations for extermination.  Margaret Sanger helped develop the foundation for Planned Parenthood and promotion of both birth control and abortion in order to weed out the undesirables (i.e. poor white and poor black people).  It also discusses how black politicians and religious leaders (i.e. Jesse Jackson) who previously spoke out against abortion and birth control became Uncle Toms and sold out future generations of African American babies for political and financial gains.  The sterilization of black women in the U.S. was also discussed along with the coercive tactics of the United Nations and the U.S. to force non-White countries to legalize abortion and birth control in order to receive food and financial help.  I have read quite a few pro-choice/anti-life blogs and websites claiming that this is a distortion of reproductive history and the movie is a complete lie...  Planned Parenthood and all leaders in the anti-life movement actually takes 1st place distorting the truth and lying.  I am glad to see an alternative viewpoint to the current killing regime in power which hides behind the lie that they are helping women and not hurting them.",1271203200,3,1827,5.356643356643357
4048184,5,B00315I6DE,"Maafa 21 opens your eyes to the true history behind the Eugenics movement carried out by Planned Parenthood.  Few people realize that Planned Parenthood was primarily a Eugenic organization who's purpose has been and continues to be the killing of ""unfit"" persons, generally meaning blacks and other minorities.  They've done a great job of obscuring their purposes by using generic terms, but this very thorough examination of their history brings out too many facts to continue to dispute.

You learn about the founder of Planned Parenthood writing to one of her fellow conspirators about how to use religious leaders in the black community to conceal their purposes:

""[We propose to] hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. And we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.""

The above statement can be verified any number of ways..including on (...) (run by the same organization as wikipedia).  You learn about the systematic marketing and targeting to black people and the placement in black neighborhoods for that purpose of aborting particularly black and minority babies.

If the reader wants some preliminary justification of this ""conspiracy theory"" it's very easy to obtain.  Go to ldi's website and find the published archives of planned parenthood's magazine ""The Birth Control Review"".  Planned parenthood was named ""The Birth Control League"" before they changed their name.  This document was edited by the founder of Planned Parenthood for a long time and often featured the writings of eugenists.  Take a look at the founder of Planned Parenthood (Margaret Sanger's) book ""The Pivot of Civilization"" also on the ldi website and read chapter 8 about Eugenics, particularly the last few paragraphs.  She makes it clear that her desire was to fulfill the eugenic purpose of eliminating the unfit, which is code for blacks, other minorities and white trash.

Consider this.  Margaret Sanger not only tried to get Planned Parenthood organization merged with the Eugenics society, she published a ""Plan for peace"" in the Planned Parenthood newsletter ""The Birth Control Review"" in April of 1932:

""
c. to keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as feebleminded, idiots, morons, insane, syphilitic, epileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes, and others in this class barred by the immigration laws of 1924.

d. to apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.

e. to insure the country against future burdens of maintenance for numerous offspring as may be born of feebleminded parents, by pensioning all persons with transmissible disease who voluntarily consent to sterilization.

f. to give certain dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation or sterilization.

g. to apportion farm lands and homesteads for these segregated persons where they would be taught to work under competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.

The first step would thus be to control the intake and output of morons, mental defectives, epileptics. The second step would be to take an inventory of the secondary group such as illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, dope-fiends; classify them in special departments under government medical protection, and segregate them on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct. Having corralled this enormous part of our population and placed it on a basis of health instead of punishment, it is safe to say that fifteen or twenty millions of our population...
""

Consider the above clearly and thoroughly from Margaret Sanger.  She used terms to refer to blacks, minorities and the poor that might not sound as objectionable as one would expect.  You don't refer to them as blacks.  You call them the feebleminded, understanding the reader would know you speak about blacks.  Notice that she clearly is speaking about ethnic groups of people when she discusses controlling immigration and she clearly considers some ethnic groups ""condition known to be ....feebleminded, idiots, morons...criminal""  How could one apply this to a whole group of people?  I don't know but Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger clearly did.

All this information can be found in published sources.  A google search of ""Margaret Sanger archives"" will find the (...) archives for her writings.  While the information is out there.  I don't know if there is anywhere else where you can get it all consolidated into a documentary as well done as this one.  THIS MOVIE IS REQUIRED VIEWING FOR ANY PERSON WHO CARES ABOUT GENOCIDE, AND ESPECIALLY FOR BLACKS WHO CARE ABOUT IT.",1267228800,91,5176,5.259124087591241

4048197,5,B00315I6DE,"Great overall documentary. They did a great job of covering things from all angles which leaves no doubt behind the agenda. This is nothing more than a long term project backed by federal funding (the tax payers money) to clear the conscious/burdens of blacks who were brought here for slave labor. They were stripped down and reprogrammed to be a mindless slave and obey the white master and after 300+ years of a mindless, reprogrammed, submissive disposition they are set free and are now seen as a burden that must be eradicated before they blend, develop, replicate,bleed, threaten white america.

The high levels of involvement is staggering but not really surprising if you've done your homework and historical analysis going back thousands of years ago.

But, it those nothing in the way of giving the people who are the target of Black Genocide credit for having the intellectual ability to not be a victim. The information provided in this documentary could have been presented in 30 minutes are less. Very redundant and akin to saying White Supremacist make guns available to Black Americans so that they can kill each other. Which is true but, the person with that gun still has to have the intellectual ability to not proceed in that manner. I feel in this documentary attempt to describe Black Genocide as Systemic Racismn the inferred conclusions of this documentary is that Blacks don't posses the intellectual ability to make their own choices and the resulting consequences of their choices.

I felt that whilst being well meaning the anti abortion lobby were using the 'race' element to further an agenda.

4048280,1,B00315I6DE,"Maafa-21: Black Genocide in 21st-Century America is a self-styled ""documentary"" produced by Life Dynamics President Mark Crutcher, which alleges to prove with graphic evidence that Margaret Sanger was a racist, Nazi-style eugenicist and rabid abortion advocate and, further, that Planned Parenthood is carrying on a conscious campaign of genocide against African Americans. As to Sanger's alleged Nazi connection, the ""proof"" adduced by Maafa-21 is that: 1) Sanger advocated some form of eugenics; 2) Hitler read about eugenics in America; 3) Sanger's 1927 eugenics conference was attended by German scientists who became Nazis seven years later, a tenuous thread leading to the remarkably equivocal conclusion ""Given the admiration Hitler expressed for the American eugenics movement, it is not unlikely that he modeled the eugenics courts in Nazi Germany after those in the U.S."" [emphasis added]  [time-points 18:16 - 36:35]  The greatest example of racism in Maafa-21 occurs at 2:03:11 when writer/producer Crutcher makes the statement ""It was Planned Parenthood who figured out that the way to make eugenics work is not to kill people, but to convince the targeted group to commit cultural suicide, and the way to do that is with birth control and abortion"" which is easily translated as black woman are so nave and/or stupid that Planned Parenthood can easily convince them to abort their babies and to tell black women they ""commit cultural suicide"", is to tell them their first duty is not to their families but their ""culture"", an injunction chillingly reminiscent of Hitler's telling German women their first duty was to bear children for the Aryan race. For its six separate examples of getting its own critical talking points 180 wrong, sometimes hilariously (see time-points 17:04, 33:56, 41:00, 56:20, 1:00:53, 1:05:48), for its temerity in calling Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a racist on the basis of a partial quote lifted bodily out of a New York Times interview [3:02:56] and for its producer's memorializing on film his unconscious contempt and disrespect for African American women, Maafa-21 earns its place alongside Battleship Potemkin (1925), Triumph of the Will (1935) and The Eternal Jew (1940) and Bowling for Columbine (2002) as a landmark study in ""Big Lie"" propaganda.

4048287,5,B00315I6DE,"Life dynamics is at the forefront of the Pro-life(anti-abortion) movement. This documentary exposes the deceipt and devious nature of Planned parenthood and its allies. It shows, with much evidence, the ties between the Nazi's and the eugenics movement of the early 20th century in America deigned to create a ""race of thoroughbreds"" excluding the disabled, the mentally insane, the jews and other minorities from the dream. Maafa 21 draws a line from Margaret Sanger, founder of the present day Planned Parenthood and fellow eugenicist friendly with the nazi party to present day Planned parenthood and her natural allies in government and among the wealthy elite. Exposed are the likes of the Rockefellar and Carnegie foundations, Bill and Melinda gates, Warren Buffet, & Richard Nixon to The Clinton's. This insidious desire to control the population of the ""least ' among us through abortion, sterilization and Birth control is the main reason Planned parenthood( the largest abortion provider in the US and the world)is located in the most impoverished places in the world including within the poor areas of US cities. Their aim is still clear, their methods abominable. They do their best to bring this message under the guise of ""choice"" and ""Family Planning"" through the leaders of the very people they wish to exterminate. Margaret Sanger was quoted in a perodical as saying ""we don't want word to get out that we want to exterminate the black race"". Through bribery, they turned former advocates for Life against their own people including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Black Panthers and numerous other leaders of the black community. They have tape recordings of Richard Nixon refering to  Black bast**ds and written documentation outlining the methods and goals of eugenics. Their dream is still alive today in our government which continues to fund the black genocide through planned parenthood. We are all involved as long as we pay taxes that contribute to the extermination of the black race in America. In addition to this, Aid in poor countries in Africa and South america is linked to the acceptance of so-called ""Family Planning"" measures such as birth control, sterilization, and abortion. With Maafa 21, the aims and designs of the Nazi's are being revealed today.",1333843200,5,2285,5.159029649595688

Every week, more blacks die in American abortion clinics than were killed in all of the Vietnam war.

4048290,5,B00315I6DE,"All Black Americans should view this documentary.  It is extremely well done. Maafa 21 stands for the African word Maafa which describes the abuse of Black Africans in America from their slavery in the 16th through 19th centuries up to and including their current targeting for Genocide in the 20th and 21st centuries (hence Maafa 21).  The documentary film / DVD focuses on the history of the supporters of Eugenics and their plans to rid America of what they believe are ""genetically inferior"" forms of humans.  Eugenics is an ""applied science or the bio-social movement which advocates the use of practices aimed at improving the genetic composition of a population"", usually referring to human populations (wikipedia).

Eugenics advocates in the early 20th century, including Margaret Sanger founder of Planned Parenthood, believed that there are gradations in the QUALITY of human genetic expression among which the white elite class is the highest form and the Black genomes are the least form.  Charles Darwin's son was a leader in the early 20th century and Winston Churchill, Alexander Graham Bell, Teddy Roosevelt, and John D. Rockefeller join a very long list of wealthy and influential people who have been involved in the Eugenics movement.

The documentary lays out a paper trail of newspaper articles, writings, letters, and other documents that tell the history of how the Eugenics movement has evolved over the 20th and into the 21st century.  It clarifies the intimate involvement of Margaret Sanger and numerous other Planned Parenthood management people. It includes brief mention of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany's application of Eugenics to justify their efforts to attain ""racial purity"" in the death camps.  The main focus is on the continued ongoing plans of the Eugenics movement including Planned Parenthood to purify the genetic stock in 21st century America.  It clearly documents communications that state the goals of Planned Parenthood and the Eugenics movement are to eliminate the Black peoples from America.

It clarifies that there has been a very strong and influential nucleus of very wealthy upper class Americans who have been concerned ever since the end of slavery about the negative economic impact of the Black minority.  They believe that Black people are indeed genetically inferior and perceive them as so much of a threat that Blacks need to be eliminated from America.  Initially these people proposed that Blacks and other ""genetically inferior"" people be segregated in colonies of work farms for their entire lives.

When that approach was unsuccessful, they turned to a strategy of spreading the alarm that the world would soon be overpopulated and that America needed to push contraception, sterilization, and abortion to limit the growth of the ""inferior populations"".  They were so politically powerful they were able to influence our national foreign policy so that any third world nation that has what Eugenics advocates fear are ""genetically defective"" (aka Black or other non-white) populations has to accept birth control and abortion clinics in order to qualify for American aid.  Doctors providing missionary aid often complain foreign aid shipments contain tons of birth control, sterilization, and abortion supplies, but minimal other needed medical and surgical supplies and medicines.

Even before abortion was legalized, Eugenics advocates promoted abortion along with contraception and involuntary or coerced sterilization as pre-requisites for indigent American Black women to receive food stamps or other medical care.  After the state laws restricting abortion were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, Planned Parenthood and the Eugenics community pushed through legislation that mandated that federal tax monies be used for funding abortions.  Now they have a perfect system for administering Black Genocide.  The Federal funding of abortion allows Planned Parenthood to make a profit on pushing abortions. Abortion funding in 2008-9 was the 3rd largest health care cost in the Federal budget.

Planned Parenthood targets Black babies by locating abortion clinics primarily in or near Black neighborhoods and they have essentially unlimited supplemental funding specifically earmarked for ""Black baby abortions"" from wealthy supporters.  This enables them to make abortions for Black women a much more affordable option (often essentially free to lower income Black women) than the cost of prenatal care and childbirth.  The results have been very effective.  Abortion now kills more Black people than heart disease, stroke, diabetes, violent crime, or any other causes of death.

The only negative in this documentary is its length.  Most people would be more comfortable viewing it in more than one sitting.  It seems they wanted to be thorough in their documentation to make sure those who view the DVD have what they need to overcome the decades of smokescreen cover up veils that Planned Parenthood and the Eugenics community have carefully used to conceal their objectives.",1327449600,55,5063,5.434227330779055
