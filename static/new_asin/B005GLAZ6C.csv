4691157,5,B005GLAZ6C,"All Four movies was Great Movies, although I wouldn't rec-amend  them for anyone under 18 years old.
 but my husband and I liked them,  thank you GSG",1410652800,,149,4.444444444444445
4691158,5,B005GLAZ6C,"Movies are campy / T&A movies.  Not the best, but nostalgia is better than reality.  Betsy Russell and Debra Foreman (Waxwork and Real Genius are better Foreman movies) are worth it.
2 dvd's (four movies), but the movies are only on one side (2 movies on bottom side) and there is no printing on the top of either disc... really odd.  Video quality is decent, given how cheesy the movies are.  Sound is decent also.",1400544000,,415,4.493333333333333

4691163,5,B005GLAZ6C,"pure 80's cheese. this would be on Joe Bob Briggs or Rhonda Shear. - slight bonus, the My Chauffeur movie, its got a very early appearance by Penn and Teller!",1468108800,,158,4.3

4691165,4,B005GLAZ6C,"Typical 80's camp with the exception of the rare 1978 Malibu Beach & the 1986 My Chauffeur, starring 1983's Valley Girl break-out star Deborah Foreman. It is a cute movie & Deborah grew as an actress significantly fro Valley Girls. Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin, sister of Steve Antin, The Last Anerican Virgin (82), The Goonies (85) & Accused (88), also the sister of famed Becerly Hills hairdresser to the ""stars""!Jonathan Antin, who in mid 2000's had his own reality hair show ""Blow Out"" on Bravo network, she is young, cute & has a bit part as a groupie.

4691169,5,B005GLAZ6C,Movies all play perfectly.  Tomboy is a fondly remembered classic.  The other movies were new to me.  My Chauffeur was a surprisingly charming movie.
