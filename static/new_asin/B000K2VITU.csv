8154351,3,B000K2VITU,"Love F. Paul Wilson, but this dvd is three or four shorts based on his stories.  Interesting and creepy, but part of my collection.",1248134400,,131,4.458333333333333
8154352,5,B000K2VITU,"Three short films based on short stories by F. Paul Wilson.  Wilson let some film students adapt his work for the screen and gets to see his words on screen again.  In ""Foet"" we see the moral dilemma a woman faces when she discovers that the beautiful new purse she covets is made from fetal tissue.  In  ""Traps"" we see a guy who is ""sure"" it's only rats running around in his attic - or maybe not.  Lastly, in ""Lipidleggin'"" the setting is the near future where the government has outlawed butter.  Yes, butter.  This is the story of a guy who refuses to give in. Very entertaining, especially for Wilsonophiles!  JUMP IN!!  Wilson even makes a cameo in one of 'em, but I won't tell you which - you gotta watch and find out for yourself!!",1246838400,3,739,4.335766423357664
8154353,3,B000K2VITU,"The Others is great for an F PAUL WILSON fan.  I like to collect anything I can by this author.  Be aware that the stories on this DVD are film projects (college?) and not mainstream features.  ""FOET"" is by far the best story out of the three on the DVD.  Read the stories first (all found in ""The Barrons and others"" by F PAUL WILSON).",1200182400,,336,4.123076923076923
8154354,5,B000K2VITU,"Three short films by three very talented young directors dramatizing three classic short stories by master storyteller F. Paul Wilson. The films are low-budget, independent productions, allowing each director to express his unique style.

In Foet, director Ian Fischer does an excellent job of showing how the main character is both repelled by and attracted to her new handbag made of foetal skin. I love the scenes where she's strolling down the sidewalk as if she's in a high fashion commercial.

Director Marc Buhmann lets you get to know his characters while slowly but relentlessly building the tension. It gave me the classic horror movie watching experience - wanting to shout at the actor, ""No! Do NOT go alone!""

Director David Moore's Lipidleggin' is full of warmth and charm even as it delivers a rather serious message about freedom of choice. The acting in Lipidleggin' is better than a lot of what comes out of Hollywood these days.

All in all, this DVD is WELL worth the price. Fans of F. Paul Wilson will not be disappointed. You'll wish it wasn't over so soon.",1174521600,6,1079,4.8478260869565215
