It begins with a song. Men ride horses at night. Too quiet. Then there is a surprise party and another song. The Kiowa Indians have a new chief, Buffalo Horns. What effect will this have? Is there enough land for everyone there? Indians are moving in, there will be a war. Whose side will this family be on? His wife is a full-blooded Kiowa. The white men shoot guns to drive off their cattle. The next day they must find their cattle. [Dark scenes hide some action.] These are dangerous times. They find some of their cattle dead - pure meanness. Strangers arrive at night, they're trappers who are leaving this area because of the trouble. But they have an attitude. One man tries to force himself on Pacers mother. But Pacer arrives with his rifle and they quickly leave. [A dark scene again hides the action.]

Then a band of Kiowas ride up. Will Pacer come out to talk? Buffalo Horns needs more warriors to fight the increasing white men; will Pacer ride with them? His mother advices Pacer to seek peace. Is this possible? Pacer and his mother travel to the Kiowa village. The Kiowas have lived in that land forever, they don't want white men taking their lands. The Kiowas do not want Pacer and his mother. On the way home men shoot at them, his mother is wounded. His father and older brother arrive, can they get a doctor? Pacer uses his rifle and the doctors young daughter to get the doctors help for his mother. Too late! The personal and racial conflicts continue. Pacers father is killed by a band of warriors when he is caught alone. [Dark scenes hide the action again.] Pacer helps his brother onto a horse so he can ride for help. After a battle Pacer saw the Flaming Star of Death and rides off to the hills to die.

This was adapted from a novel of the same name. The story about conflicts over land is a long known cause of war, and not just in the Old West. Elvis Presley died young, like many in show business. They don't work regular hours and need pills for sleeping and then to awake. The long term use of drugs like opiods causes medical problems. If tolerances increase more of a drug is needed. This can cause an overdose of another problem.",1496275200,,2194,4.425742574257426
