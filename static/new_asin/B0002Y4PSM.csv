8034782,5,B0002Y4PSM,"A sweet, silly Christmas movie about discovering what the holiday is really all about.  I can't pinpoint why, but this has become one of my favorites :)",1456876800,,152,4.62962962962963
8034783,5,B0002Y4PSM,"This movie has slept beneath the radar of many Christmas lovers (like myself) for years. They used to air this every Christmas on Disney Channel but it's a bit more challenging to catch it live on TV nowadays around the holidays.

If you've never seen this Christmas classic, it's worth the purchase. Trust me. The cast is fantastic and its a relatively quick watch that will sure to keep your Christmas spirits high!

This is an overlooked Christmas gem that deserves more recognition than it gets.",1440115200,,499,4.790697674418604

8034785,5,B0002Y4PSM,"It's older computer graphics, but a great story of 3 brothers looking for the meaning of Christmas.  Used to watch it on cable, but they quit playing it over the years so I had to buy it.",1360540800,,187,4.054054054054054
8034786,5,B0002Y4PSM,"I bought this for my 3yr. old granddaughter based on Amazon reviews. I personally think it is ok, but my granddaughter LOVES IT! We watch it over and over again and it fits the bill for her...which is most important..what she thinks, not Nana.

Therefore I give it 5 stars!",1359849600,,273,4.46
8034787,4,B0002Y4PSM,"They used to show this on Disney Channel every Christmas. I was thrilled when I found it for sale here on Amazon. In this story, Santa (Bryan Cranston, 'Breaking Bad') and his wife (Caroline Rhea, 'Phineas and Ferb') have three sons: One whose head is full of numbers and figures (Richard Kind, 'Spin City'), one who just loves to invent new toys (Kevin McDonald 'Kids in the Hall') and one who just wants to party (Harland Williams 'Meet the Robinsons'). To determine which one is worthy to fill his father's big black boots, the boy are sent to Santa Monica, California to find the true meaning of Christmas. Little dreaming that the whole thing is a plot by a conniving elf (Joe Flaherty, 'Freaks and Geeks') to take over Christmas for himself!

Admittedly, the animation is a little cheesy, but the script is good and the performances are excellent so there's plenty to like about this forgotten holiday treasure.",1359331200,,917,4.767295597484277
8034788,5,B0002Y4PSM,"Excellent movie. It's running time is shorter then I remember but just as awesome. Thanks for bringing back some memories. I shared this  movie with my brother and girlfriend and they also remembered it. I'm defiantly keeping this is in DVD collection.

Also I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston, and I didn't even know he was a voice actor in this. That was a major plus.

Long live YTV.",1358294400,,384,4.457142857142857
