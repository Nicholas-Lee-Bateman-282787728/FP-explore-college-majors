2699226,3,B000KZRP12,"I was a little disappointed in the dvd because I thought the title was misleading.  The title needs to include ""gothic"" in it so customers don't get something they aren't looking for.  Her performance dances are set to music that I didn't particularly like. I totally agree with her that yoga can only enhance a person's bellydance experience.  She is an awesome bellydancer but I personally don't like the gothic style.  I guess I learned that if it says contemporary rather than traditional, it may need more scrutinizing before I buy it.",1181174400,16,540,4.836956521739131

2699228,5,B000KZRP12,"I was anxious to review this program and I am not disappointed. A fantastic demonstraton in performance of fluid dancing and strobing at its best. Ariellah is down to business teaching her technique calmly and suredly. A great combination yoga and dance work out with the essential of belly dance exercising small controlled movements which especially work the abs. The Hip work is challenging as it sometimes executed on toe, and changing levels. Chest isolation drills are intense. Arm drills, are lengthy and detailed as to benefit the serious dancer to creating fluid movement.

The setting is simple, the music is at times freaky but blends into her dark style which is alluring, mysterious and captivating. I have seen many tribal dancers execute their personal styles, sometimes straying too far from belly dance and creating a different fusion, Ariellah's moves are defintelty founded in the basics and embellished with her own personal style. A great learning program, challenging for the beginner without knowledge of the basics, an essential program for the aspiring tribal dancer.",1180828800,3,1092,5.275862068965517
2699229,5,B000KZRP12,"I can only join the other reviewers, this is really an exceptional instruction DVD. And since it hasn't been translated to German yet I am really glad my English ist good enough. ;) I really love the drills but i wasn't able to finish them yet as my arms were nearly breaking off. The choreography is really nice especially since it doesnt layer too much but nicely combines ""easy"" yet goodlooking movements. I also enjoyed the choice of music, less traditional and thus more bearable for my boyfriend.

Ariellah is doing a great job in teaching, she appears to be very centerd and calm, talking clearly and calm. The explanations are excellent and the repetition of saying what to do and the constant reminder to control ones position are very helpful.

If you are ever reading this, Ariellah, thanks for this wonderful dvd!",1180310400,5,825,4.7622377622377625
2699230,5,B000KZRP12,"Ariellah was already one of my favorite dancers before I bought the DVD, but having missed the Durga Tour when it came through my area, I wasn't sure how she would be as an instructor.  As it turns out, she can teach as well as perform, and she does both very well.

There is definitely something for both new and experienced dancers alike on this DVD.  As has already been stated, there's 75 minutes of drills (not including the yoga) and about 45 minutes of choreography and performances.  The drills are actually broken up into two sections, the second being for more advanced students.  The choreography is also broken down into two sections, and she even goes over the counts (a godsend for someone like me who can't always get the moves ""in sync"" with the music without endless repetition).  Aside from getting my left and right messed up a few times (something I've always done), I actually felt that the choreographies were quite ""doable"" right off the bat (something I am not often able to say, as I'm one of those women who usually take weeks to get a choreographed dance down).

I felt everything, from the selection of yoga poses to the music, were well thought out.  I think the thing that impressed me most was when she seemed to know when I was starting to make certain form mistakes (""make sure you aren't doing this with your neck"") and would have the viewers check with their bodies to make sure that they were still in proper dance posture several times.  Lastly, if you need motivation, just watch the performances at the end of the DVD. Those three performances should provide plenty of it!",1179273600,14,1611,4.604895104895105
2699231,5,B000KZRP12,"I recently had the opportunity to take a workshop from Ariellah and, while I expected something immense and remarkable, this DVD even goes beyond that!  The yoga, and I'm a long term practicioner,both short and long options, are blood warmers very appropriate to the subsequent drills and practices.  I encourage you to look closely at this wonderful teacher and performer, and learn, for she has much to offer!  Nothing in my current collection comes even close to this, and ending it with three performances - yikes!",1179100800,2,518,5.0
2699232,5,B000KZRP12,"I'm as impressed as everyone who's reviewed this video before me. Being unable to resist belly dance videos (and having only those for instruction) I've ended up collecting a shocking number of them. Of these, at least 90 percent must be belly dance isolations. So you wouldn't think I needed any more. Well think again.

I immediately loved Ariellah's two fantastic drills -adding up to 75 minutes of hard work. I haven't managed 75 at a go yet but am notching up to about 40 minutes so far. That's separate from all the yoga. Ariellah has selected yoga poses and very thoughtfully, there's a short session for those who are not yoga-familiar and a longer one for those who are.

There are no distractions during these drills. Nothing comes in the way. Not the music, not too much talking - nothing. It's an intuitively put together set of drills in which she gives tips I haven't found anywhere else in all my videos and reminders on posture and breathing. Her timing with these is impeccable. Just when I find I'm getting tired, she says ""Go on for a bit longer"" . That comes from being very well tuned into what her dance students must feel.

Ariellah is all about control right down to the micromovement. If you've seen her elsewhere, you'll know that the seems to take the music, reroute it right through her body, and by the time it reaches you, you're seeing the music as well as hearing it. Her drills begin to give you the foundation for that control In just a few sessions I've found a visible difference with the sharpness of my hip and rib cage movements. The arms? A long way to go for me but I'm relentlessly sticking to the especially solid arms section. All I can say is that I can finely shimmy one shoulder at a time now. Well, the right one, anyway.

The combinations are versatile and for me, make a fantastic collection when combined with similar ones from other tribal fusion videos like East Coast Tribal and Tribal Fusion NYC. Also Bellydance for Beautiful Freaks.

I also like a lot of the music on this video, though the lyrics of one or two are nothing to dance about. Something about a plane about to come down. I'm not so sure about that. But the most-used song, Stiga, by the group Lumin, is very sensual and addictive.",1179100800,74,2250,4.518427518427519
2699233,5,B000KZRP12,"This is the best DVD I've seen in a long long long long long time.

I'm a fan of tri-yoga, but the music on the DVD is unbearable (especially after 3 years of use)...so I was looking for an alternative on Amazon and Ariellah's DVD popped up.  I uTubed it and found the uTube of her welcome message (which I totally agree with) and a little preview.

I've always admired her dancing - but just because someone is a good dancer, doesn't mean they are a good teacher.  This is definately not the case with Ariellah.  I won't repeat the other reviews...I'll just say ""thank you"" for this great DVD.  It is definately worth the money.",1179014400,11,629,4.379310344827586
2699234,5,B000KZRP12,"This tape lacks nothing!

I worked so hard keeping up with this workout: Finally a DVD that doesn't skimp on technique, and the yoga is presented in a relevant fashion, so it doesn't seem out of place (those of you who have Rachel Brice's DVD know what I mean).  The drills are very well explained and correct a lot of the mistakes that other DVDs allow you to make (i.e. snake arms start in the shoulder, not the elbow), and there are enough of them to really feel, without being boring.

This is the DVD for belly dancers who are between studios or need extra practice, or who want look good before they take classes.

And the performances aren't bad, either... but that's not why I got this DVD.",1178582400,6,698,4.387596899224806
2699235,5,B000KZRP12,"Ariellah is an amazing dancer and instructor. This DVD provides both a short AND long yoga warmup as well as a cooldown that are easily ready to incorporate into a daily dance routine.

The drills are great for those of us who can't seem to create our own drill sequences and they thoroughly work each necessary muscle group to the fullest.

The choreography Ariellah teaches is fluid, unique and powerful yet not so difficult that a beginning bellydancer can't follow along AND learn the movements.

Every sequence taught during the choreography section can easily be used in a dancer's routines.

Finally, the icing on the cake of this DVD are the THREE (that's right, I said THREE) performances showcasing Ariellah's breathtaking style, amazing technique and wonderful dance ability.

Honestly, I own a LOT of Bellydance DVDs to incorporate into my practice/drill routine and THIS is one that I can easily say is a MUST HAVE. If you only buy this DVD, you will have MORE than enough to begin truly building your bellydance base.",1178496000,6,1031,4.902298850574713

2699237,5,B000KZRP12,This is a fun dvd. I'm new to belly dancing and this dvd was my first experience. I wanted something completely different to add some variety to my fitness routine. I found the steps easy to follow and the pace is good.,1434153600,,219,4.238095238095238

This is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I have experienced difficulty with World Dance NY dvds before.  Some seem very finicky and will not work on all DVD players, or plays sporadically.

2699242,3,B000KZRP12,"This video takes the boot camp approach to belly dancing and pushes you to drill the moves for long periods of time. As I was just relearning the art of belly dancing after an 8+ year hiatus (and following a decision to get back into shape), the drilling was too difficult. My muscles would just give out half-way through the drills, which was disheartening. I love how serious and dedicated Ariellah is, but I also feel that belly dancing is about joy and passion, which does not come across in this instructional video. Since I am not seeking to become a professional dancer, this video doesn't suit my needs - I want to have fun, not drill my shoulders off. There are many people who would like this video, particularly those who are very serious about taking their art to the next level, but if you are like me and are just looking for the joy of the dance, then you may want to steer clear of this one (and perhaps get Amira's Bellydance 101 instead). On a positive note, I will affirm that Ariellah absolutely knows what she is doing and has a lot to offer the serious professional dancer. The yoga was also a nice touch.",1403136000,,1127,4.423076923076923

2699244,4,B000KZRP12,"WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ Technical tips for achieving beautiful moves during the drilling sections. I have been thinking why the movement looks so good when practised with Ariellah and it's not just the tips: she first lets you drill intensely what I call now a ""muscle opener"" (a simple move to increase your range of motion) and then introduces the more complex drill, like a hip sway before hip figure 8's, etc.
+ Beautiful slow drills
+ Snake arm session that will help you achieve the most graceful arm undulations (best in my collection)
+ Drilling for your obliques and lower abs. In all BD DVD's they tell you to use your obliques for mayas and taxseem (vertical hip figure 8's), but they just tell you that with practice you'll get better and don't tell you how to do it. While doing horizontal hip sways, Ariellah asks you not to shift your weight completely (as opposed to what more oriental dancers ask you to do). In order not to shift your weight completely you need to engage your abs more thoroughly, this is how you really train them for takseems and mayas. So if you follow Ariellah's instructions carefully, your practice will be ""perfect practice"" and you'll learn how to use your obliques.
+ One of the best ""only upper body"" undulations in my collection. The undulations done by Ariellah and most tribal bellydancers are different than the ones taught by Neon or by Sadie which are full body undulations and also different from the only lower body undulations which I have only seen with Jenna and Autumn; so pick your choice, all are excellent teachers.
+ Music selection (see below)
+ Excellent for advanced beginners and to ""grow"" with it slowly

The achievement of beautiful movement through excellent technique shows you Ariellah's extensive ballet background. During the vertical figure 8's up-to-down (mayas) and down-to-up (taxseem) drills, Ariellah gives a few tips regarding tucking the pelvis and weight placement that definitely helped mine looked much much better and effortless in just one session! While doing snake arms she tells you to concentrate your effort in your upper arms, so that your hands are freed and can look beautiful. I only paid $10 for my DVD and for the improvement I got from following her tips and cues, I would have gladly paid the full price. These drills are useful for all bellydance genres, so if you like Egyptian or Cabaret but are scared away by the ""gothic"" look; believe me, she drills beautiful slow movement and combines movements with a wide range of motion with smaller and quicker movements, so you will certainly benefit from this DVD, specially if you have no real life teacher to correct you (because of her invaluable tips). The only complaint I have is the ""mirror-problem"". I rarely have a problem with it. I think I just look at what they do and ""copy"" it in the same direction that I see the movement, ignoring the verbal cueing. The problem here is that Ariellah is continuosly saying ""right"" or ""left"", but too often, so it can really get me out of synch when I am trying just to follow what I see.

Regarding drills I own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modern-Tribal-Belly-Dance-with-Asharah-Beginner-tribal-fusion-bellydance-how-to-Belly-dancing-instruction/dp/B000UZRT4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modern Tribal Belly Dance, with Asharah: Beginner tribal fusion bellydance how-to, Belly dancing instruction</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Bellydance-with-Rachel-Brice-TWO-DVD-SET-Complete-belly-dancing-instructional-program-Belly-dancing-classes-with-yoga-How-to-in-Rachel-s-tribal-style-belly-dance-including-full-choreographies/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine: Bellydance with Rachel Brice (TWO-DVD SET): Complete belly dancing instructional program, Belly dancing classes with yoga, How-to in Rachel's tribal style belly dance, including full choreographies</a>&nbsp;(best layered shimmy section I own). Personally I think Asharah's drills (and her tough conditioning section) helped me improve very fast and when I used this DVD, both drill levels included seemed fairly easy with some exceptions. I am not quite sure that had I owned and drilled with Ariellah's DVD first, if Asharah's would have seemed easy; I do not think so. Asharah increases the tempo more and makes more ""punctuated"" and sharp moves. If I could only get one drilling DVD, I would probably get Asharah's (because you get more fitness benefits and muscle control from it, and my main goal when I started BD and other dance DVDs was to get some exercise but in a fun way). If your goal is beauty and artistry you might get more out of Ariellah's DVD. Better yet, purchase Ariellah's DVD first, so you learn and drill beautiful form from the beginning, then you can move up to Asharah's.

Why 4 stars and not 5? I do not know! I have rated Asharah's DVD with 5 and I think I got more out of it, maybe this is an unfair rating...(P.D. Yes, this was unfair. After using this DVD more often, I think it is as useful as Asharah's but in a different way...)

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate DRILLS: Very good for beginners, starts very slow and gradually increases the tempo and adds some relevees; easy in terms of layering INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Excellent - Industrial (gothic), blends perfectly with the drills. FUN FACTOR: Medium - It's drilling, so it's not really for fun, but it is not boring either.

CONTENT:
1) Short yoga warm-up - Normally warm-up's are too short to be effective or too long to be used before your main routine, this one is of perfect length while still being effective.
2) Long yoga warm-up - I think it is more a conditioning yoga segment than a warm-up and it's ok for that purpose. Ariellah, Elisheva and Fayzah are the only bellydancers that also do some exercises for your abs other than bellydance moves. I really think this is necessary to improve your balance in order to be able to perform on releve.
3) Drills Level 1 - All the drills in this DVD (levels 1 & 2) are explained carefully and first drilled at slow speed; there is almost no layering, so you drill each move independently to really do it with closed eyes
4) Drills Level 2 - These are a bit more difficult and you will add upper arms movements to the hip drills
5) Choreography breakdown - it is very clearly explained step by step. I have a hard time remembering more than two 8-counts, so I am probably not ready for full choreos. This choreography consists of six combinations each containing three 8-counts. This is the same length as other choreographies, only this one seems a bit easier, since it has less popping and no ticking, also less travelling, and fewer turns and arm movements. So regarding full choreos, maybe this one is the easiest you can get, but not the best looking though.
6) Choreography practise - The same choreography is practised with two different songs, one faster than the other. This is an excellent idea, so you can improve your skills without needing to learn a different choreo and you can see how you can apply the same moves to different music.
7) Performance by Ariellah
8) Yoga Cool down. The cooldown is not really a cooldown and it's not really yoga. It has two or three very brief stretching yoga exercises and a couple of minutes of relaxation routine (like when you lie down for meditation).

MUSIC: Industrial (gothic).  I need to say that I do not like listening to this type of music, but dancing to it is another story. It was fascinating!! The cadence and slow evocative lyrics helped me through the long drilling segment (normally I do not like slow music, I find it cheesy, but dancing to what sounds like a contemporary medieval church choir feels totally different, just delicious). The gothic lyrics are slow (ideal for sultry moves with mysterious and dark accents), but come together with industrial faster beats, so that you can easily increase your tempo during the drilling session. On top of this, Ariellah uses 2 or 3 different songs that match each drilling section so you do not get bored (same songs for both drilling levels).

EMPHASIS:
Perfecting your technique to obtain beautiful and dramatic moves, so a lot of drills and technique tips to make your moves look vibrant, full of emotion but at the same time effortless. It also emphasizes toning your abs (obliques and lower abs) with slow controlled movements.",1392163200,3,8573,5.158159597411934

You can practice basic moves as a beginner, or you can learn a different style of belly dance as an advanced dancer. It has a nice relaxing yoga warm-up and a short one variation when you have less time. Isolation practice is quite challenging and you can use the choreography (which has 2 different music tracks to choose) as a drill. And of course the music is awesome.",1385942400,,441,4.525

I love her Musical choices especially in her Hip Drills Section, She can really draw you in and you will WANT to practice with her, I found myself almost talking to her and facing the screen a lot. I also can go along with her for many more hours than anyone else. Her Choreography section is the best I have seen from a DVD so far, because her moves ""make sense"" , it makes it easy to learn, and you will want to learn it. She leaves out a lot of unnecessary movements in her choreography section and keeps it all in the body.

I'm in the middle of practicing the DVD right now after dusting it off from the shelves again and it reminded me of how good it makes me feel every time I finally pull this DVD down and get my lazy butt to use it. I'm always happy when I finish doing her quick yoga warm-up and her fantastic belly dance drills. (She covers not only upper and lower body, but pieces of upper and lower body like arm undulations in detail, different kinds and how to maneuver those muscles properly to avoid damage while both strengthening and toning, hip drills etc...I could go on for a while there.) I emailed her a long time ago to tell her I admired her product and that it helped me improve a lot! She was SO sweet and kind, just how I thought she'd be, It was so thoughtful of her to reply to me herself, her letter to me was very nice. I think she's one of the best belly dancers out there along with a few others of my favorites (LOL I can't pick just one, there's SO many good dancers out there it's difficult to choose only one favorite!) I love Ariellah's DVD and her way of instructing you through the difficult moves, she makes them easier, not easy, but easier to understand and therefore easier to execute over a period of practice time, she's so detailed and great at explaining how to do the techniques that I always get so excited about breaking them down and practicing them individually when I actually get myself to work out and practice. LOL Anyways, if you're interested in Tribal Belly Dance, I would recommend this DVD and you should also look into: Rachel Brice, Zoe Jakes, Mardi Love etc...Just type in Google search: Tribal Belly Dance or ATS Dance or American Tribal Style Belly Dance etc...LOL Ok, I'm gonna get back to my drills, but I thought that since I bought this DVD and I love it, that this review was long overdue and I hope it helps some people decide. :)",1329868800,3,2164,4.306372549019608

There are many dance instructional DVDs on the market, but many of the instructors give, instead of teach, a class.  Ariellah focuses on proper technique throughout all of the instruction.  She also has a great personality and ""spark"" - I enjoy studying from her.  She begins and ends with yoga, and her yoga practice feels so good that I like to do her yoga practice separately just for my own yoga practice!  She also has two levels of technique instruction - the second more advanced than the first.  You can choose the level practice, or you can do the entire practice to strengthen your technique.  At the end, you learn a choreography, which is a big plus to just practicing technique.  I also prefer her selection of music to many other Tribal DVDs.  I highly recommend this practice.

I took a few of my new found skills to class with me though, and promply got in trouble, as they are not traditional.  Even though I feel a little old for this style, I love the music, the dance, and some of the look of the tribal style.  Even though I have to keep it a secret from  my teacher). Ariellah, is a fabulous dancer, and even beginners, should be able to do this. I have bought about 10 dvds now but this is by far my favorite.  Its the one I always go to, to practice.",1317859200,6,1080,4.042654028436019
2699257,5,B000KZRP12,"I have taken a couple of belly dance classes and used Shamira's videos for a few years so I'm not quite a beginner, but Ariellah's style is refreshingly different and deceptively difficult.  It's not for everyone, a couple of my exercise buddies can't get past her tattoos and dreads, but her instruction is clear and precise and her style is beautiful and subtle.  It strikes me more as a style of dance that would be seen in a night club, not like more traditional belly dance.

The yoga is challenging but easy to follow once you have seen the pattern.  I like the full yoga better than the short one, but that may just be a matter of preference.  The full yoga section spends a lot of time moving through downward dog, lunges, and planks, which is great for what I need.

The isolation drills are brutal!  Since the style is so different and so precise it takes a lot of repetition to get each move right and build your muscles the way they need to be.  This section definitely leaves me with lots of room for improvement, but in order to move on to the choreography you need to have a handle on the drills.

The choreography section is great too, but don't try it until you've done the drills or you won't know what she's doing for sure, unless you've worked with this style before!

There are 3 performances by Ariellah and they're hypnotic in their precision and flow.  There's surprisingly little hip work compared to the belly dance I know but far more precision and subtlety.  Love it!

The only thing I wish was different is she doesn't mirror what she's doing, so when she says ""right"" she's going to her right, which facing you is left, so when I get to working on the choreography for real I'll have to decide whether it's easier to follow her words or mirror what she's doing.  It's a common issue with many videos and it drives me nuts!

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this video.  If goth style isn't for you, then keep that in mind.",1309564800,4,1955,4.434173669467787
2699258,4,B000KZRP12,"I am a beginner at this,  and I have purchased several belly dance instructional dvd.

The drills are well done, the choreography is great (although could stand to be longer since it ends up giving you only a small segment to work with), the performances are fantastic and the music selection was interesting (in a good way).  I would definitely recommend this DVD to any belly dancer.  Oh, and Ariella's tattoos are very nice to look at.  Just sayin'.  :)",1300060800,2,480,4.459770114942529

Ariellah is a very calm person, I enjoy trying to perform the movements and she is very good at starting slowly to make sure you have a better understanding of the movements. Her explanations are simple but effective, however I do have one criticism. As a true beginner to belly dance and to yoga, I really wish she would have offered a section that explained the yoga movements before doing them. This is the main reason I subtracted a star, because while I can see the movements and somewhat understand them, I had to watch the dvd several times to see how she does the yoga poses before I could just follow along and begin to mimic them. Otherwise, this is actually a very relaxing dvd to learn Belly dancing from or to use for the yoga section. Definitely worth a shot (even if you're uncoordinated like me lol)!",1299542400,,994,4.378378378378378

The menu format is very accessible making it easy to tailor the instruction based on your own time schedule.  The drills are broken into ""levels"" that are appropriate for beginners and intermediate students.  The yoga warm-up can be gentle and short (for those students not familiar with yoga) or a little more rigorous (for practicing yoginis); and the cool-down is brief yet appropriate.

I can't explain what it is.  I love drills, so it's not that.  I also enjoyed the music, though a very risky soundtrack selection.

I suggest you check that out if you're interested in buying. I love her style and she is a great teacher. I've purchased a few other belly dance videos that haven't inspired me or taught me a thing. This makes me want to purchase more and eventually perform!

The music is a little silly at times (the Gregorian chant to techno beat made me laugh a little), but it's all very palatable if you're open minded.

At first it's all very hard. You're going to be burning in your legs and arms, and your body's not going to want to bend in certain ways. After a month of just drilling the first set, I find myself able to do everything so far and come as close to fluid movements as possible. The second set of drills is alittle more intense.

She instructs too quickly and many moves are just not made for anyone not in great shape. I can see that I would probably like this down the road when I get in much better physical condition and more experienced at belly dancing. Since it claims to be a training and conditioning system, I felt it was a little misleading. This DVD is not for the beginner. If you are new to the art, then I highly suggest either Luscious, the Belly Dance Workout or East Coast Tribal with Sera.

Ariellah is a wonderful teacher who clearly knows her students - she reminds you at all the right times to check your posture, encourages you to keep going with the drills, etc. - and I like that she wears clothes that allow you to clearly see all of her movements, including her legs and feet.  Her performances at the end are just beautiful - music, costumes, movements, everything.  This isn't a very difficult DVD; both the dance movements and yoga postures are quite basic.  It's suitable for beginners, but more advanced dancers may find it helpful as a way to keep up a drill regimen at home.  Her simple choreography is a good starting point for beginner-intermediate dancers who need some help putting together a routine or creating combinations.",1263686400,5,820,4.828571428571428

Contemporary Bellydance and Yoga Conditioning With Ariellah combines my two major fitness loves - yoga and bellydancing in a somewhat challenging, but still manageable for most people, DVD.

There are three sections of yoga warm-ups, which sometimes I use alone, and about an hour and 15 minutes of belly dancing drills and moves. In addition, there are also some of Ariellah's performances on this video and the darkly vibrant music of bands such as Lumin and Solace. This is a real winner, especially for those who are also interested in yoga.",1263254400,5,651,5.08411214953271
2699271,4,B000KZRP12,"I would give 5 stars if this DVD had better menu options to skip over the excessive ""talky"" bits.

That being said ... for beginners ... Ariellah does a great job explaining proper mechanics for each movement.  You will really understand the movement and how to use your body.  The downside is that if you already know movement mechanics ... you will be crying from boredom.

This DVD is by no means dumbed-down just b/c it is best for beginners.  If you can follow to the end, you will learn some advanced movement and choreography.  As an advanced dancer, I have to do something else while practicing with this DVD.  Drill a move, then wash a few dishes while she explains body mechanics I already know, tear off the rubber gloves and run back to the computer to drill the move I don't alrady know, repeat.  So I work-out and get the house clean at the same time.

A better menu to ""cherry-pick"" the advanced moves from the beginner explanations and body-mechanics drills would have made this 5 stars.

This DVD is great to learn body mechanics.  For more advanced fare & less talk, I recommend Anasama or Elisheva.

2699276,5,B000KZRP12,"My DVD ""BellyDance and yoga conditioning"" by Ariellah has arrived!

I was so impressed! I have many similar DVDs already and I know many different isolations already. But Adriellah is able to help me perfect them as well as teaching something new. No doubt, she is 1st class but many teachers are 1st class too. Yet, they somehow tend to think we are not so smart so they teach us some not so smart moves. If they dance gracefully, they teach us to move in a similar way but not exactly the same. e.g. snake arms; I never knew I have to turn the shoulder forward before the lifting of shoulder, then elbow and wrist, no wonder they look much better than me! Now I know the secret and Adriellah is not miserly to hide her secret from me. She is the only teacher who teaches me this turning forward... Also shimmy, I never knew you have to move the glute rather than the knees. No wonder! From Amazon.net, most customers give her a 5 star comment on this DVD; and I will do the same! She is very good at her subject and she is able to teach! This is the 5 star standard of any person who takes up teaching as a post.

Adriellah thinks we can all dance well. So she breaks the move into bits and starts from scratch. Once we master it, she adds a bit more and a bit more. In the end, I can do as well as she or nearly. The tone is right, the music excellent, the lighting perfect. I have bought one by Blanca. She is also an excellent dancer but in the tutorial section, it frightens me. Behind her, the background has been whitened. It is not natural, it is by way of editing, I believe. In the end, the white light blinds me! How can I do the tutorials? (Other than that, the rest is perfect. But this little thing has killed my whole perception of her very good teaching.)

Ariellah has a pefect body, not a big bust body like many belly dancers have but it is superb too, the kind of body well toned. This DVD has become my favourite and I am practising her moves day and night whenever I have some spare time (until replaced another one later). After a couple of days with her practices, my whole ab has been so well toned that I can see a round shape of my waist (as a lot of work by the obligues) instead of a sheet shape and it looks very much better! Yes, her DVD has instilled a lot of confidence in me! Not to mention I can follow her yoga practice to stretch the body, my another favourite subject!

The exercises themselves were good for building the muscles you need for dancing.

2699282,5,B000KZRP12,"This video has a special place in my heart.  It was the first video I followed where I could actually see myself ""getting"" the moves.  Ariellah breaks them down so perfectly.  Make no mistake when I first started I could barely do anything she was demonstrating and could barely make it through the first set of drills, but after awhile I found myself able to do the entire video without even watching it.  I appreciate the constant reminders about posture, and how you should be feeling while you are doing a movement.  Depending on your skill level I think this video will provide weeks of learning.  My skill level when I started wasn't very high.  I owned maybe 4 or 5 belly dance dvd's and practiced 2 or 3 times a week.  Ariellah in part inspired me to spend more time learning.  Yes shes ""goth"" and I think its awesome, I appreciate seeing someone who looks more like me playing music in the background that I listen to.  I rarely do the yoga warm-up as I have my own warm-up that I like quite a bit, but hers is relaxing and pretty gentle.

It is wonderful to see how she applys her own interpretation to belly dance. The music is awesome, and during the yoga and drills the costume and background are not distracting.

She names some, like downward dog, but when you're trying to do the poses and follow the video and can't see, it would help if she said ""come to warrior two"" instead of saying ""come forward with the right knee"" but the video is unclear from there.  That's my only problem, I like the music, the setting, the simplicity of it.  I will keep up with the video, but I'll either have to memorize it, or use another video--MTV Yoga, the first disc, has a good basic workout and if you're a big girl and out of shape like me, it'll work for you too.",1231977600,2,692,4.111111111111111

There's an extensive yoga set which helps a lot with the isolations (you can really tell the difference in your ability if you try the isolations  without doing her full yoga routine first-- the yoga really opens you up) and which is interesting and effective just on its own.  Then there's about three regular belly dance instructional dvds worth of isolation drills, which are explained very clearly, with attention to the details which separate good technique from body-damaging technique. And THEN there's a rather lengthy choreography. To top it all off, she avoids making the choreography nothing more than a stringing together of the drills. The choreography is another step up, it embellishes and advances the moves she taught in the previous sections. It's the best instructional dvd I've ever tried. I only hope she makes more!

2699290,5,B000KZRP12,"This dvd works for me - I think it is a good workout and certainly worth the money. There is a lot of material, not something I can do all at once (please can we have a matrix? or long dvd's broken down into different workout lengths like yoga ones?)
I've been reading through the other reviews so that I don't bother saying the same things. (Mala, you always give great reviews, thanks.) I will say that what I like most is the clear instruction on which muscles to isolate, and why.

Some of the negative reviews say the drills are boring - well yes they are, but long drills build muscle memory and cleaner movements, which is why I need a dvd to keep me going and Ariellah does that...if you just want a dance workout get luscious or something like that.

Another says the yoga isn't integrated into the bellydancing. The yoga, drills, combinations are all seperate sections. Yoga is of course wonderful for building strength, flexibility, calmness etc etc I'm not sure I understand why you need it 'integrated'. It's cross training! I am no yoga teacher though and don't feel qualified to comment on the quality of the yoga instruction. A few more stretches inbetween drills would be nice, but of course I am capable of pausing and doing that myself. (Or like I said at the start, sections broken down and remixed into a series of 30, 45 60 minute workout would be wonderful, but I don't deduct a star as none of the dance dvd's do that yet...). I think if you want yoga and dancing integrated then you need to look through the vinyasa flow dvd's. Dance the chakras has the yoga and dancing seperate aswell (and the dancing is not great!)

And I think the one star review came from someone who couldn't bring themselves to watch the dvd because of the gothic feel - absolutely, if for some reason goth freaks you out, don't buy it! Although on a scale of gothic this really is quite mild in any case.

Personally I like most of the music (except the beautiful piece for the second performance ends with a rather 'hellish' last phrase, but if you like the genre you won't care). Overall, I think Ariellah teaches well, it has a good mix of options (probably not for absolute beginners) and it is worth the price.",1221868800,5,2216,4.477722772277228

She has much more personality and is far more engaging (and far less pretensious) than a certain other ""superstar"" tribal dancer. I really recommend this DVD.",1206057600,6,379,4.588235294117647

2699297,5,B000KZRP12,"Of all the tribal DVDs I have seen, I find this one the easiest to follow and the one that has really conditioned me for tribal. Ariellah is excellent. The fact that she takes her time explaining everything and gives you lots of practice with each drill makes it a perfect learning tool.",1201737600,4,287,4.433962264150943
2699298,5,B000KZRP12,For any bellydancer who loves true tribal fusion with a touch of goth you'll love this. Its some good training. I don't really think this is for a beginner but hey if you keep at it you can really get it. Awesome!!!,1201564800,2,215,4.142857142857143
2699299,5,B000KZRP12,"I got into gothic bellydance about a year or two ago and I have been pretty disappointed with the videos. But I took a chance and bought Ariellah's video and I am glad that I did. Her DVD was wonderful. The yoga stretches have greatly improved my flexibility as well as isolations. I would recommend this to anyone, especially with those who, like me, can not find too many ""worthy"" videos.",1201219200,4,390,4.507042253521127
2699300,5,B000KZRP12,"This DVD is excellent for improving technique IF you don't mind the music and IF you like to drill.

I really like this DVD. I personally don't care too much for her modern goth music.  I prefer to dance to more traditional sounds, but her music is unoffensive and fairly easy to ignore.

Let's face it, the only way to really get a move down well is to practice.  This DVD is all about practice.  Ariella drills each move for a couple minutes, giving you plenty of time to explore and improve.  She adds some variations and level changes to keep you challenged, and there are 2 different drill sections.  The moves are well explained, and she seems to know when my posture is slipping and gives me a nice reminder.

There are 2 yoga warm ups, short and long.  If yoga isn't your thing don't worry, there is plenty of other content on this DVD.  Just be sure to do some other warm up and stretch before you begin.  Personally, I liked her yoga warm ups, but I tend to use the short one so I have more time to practice dance.

I like her choreography, and she explains it clearly.  She then performs the choreo to 2 different songs to show it's versatility.  This is good for those who don't like her music, you can pick the least offensive song.

I liked her performances at the end, even if I'm not a fan of the music.  (I actually like one of the songs she performs to.)  If you don't like goth, then I doubt you'll like her outfits, but again, there is a lot of other content on this DVD.  I borrow what I like and ignore the rest.

Ariella is a VERY skilled dancer.  Her moves are crisp and clean.  I can always tell what move she is doing.  She doesn't wiggle, she dances.  Practice with this DVD has improved my control and endurance.

For those who do like goth, I recommend this over the other goth belly dance DVDs.  Ariella does a better job of explaining the moves, and then adding variations and layers.  She gives you time to explore and absorb a move before going to another one.  She drills with precision, and teaches you how to achieve it.  She practices in plain clothes and you can always see her feet.  Her choreos show you how to put it all together.

If you really want clean moves, then this is the DVD for you.",1199664000,12,2234,4.262529832935561
2699301,5,B000KZRP12,"I received this DVD today, which I ordered because of the rave reviews describing Ariellah's very precise instruction techniques, spare sets, perfect timing, etc. After throwing out two entirely worthless DVDs for being, well, entirely worthless, I had to see immediately just how good this was.

Everyone was right. I admit that I haven't looked at the yoga sections at all because they're not the reason I got this. I wanted something that could put me through my paces on a step-by-step level for belly dance technique. This is that something.

Ariellah is fantastic. Because she is so good, you can see exactly what she is describing. I watched all but the last set of drills and about half of the first combination, knowing I wouldn't get to any combinations for a while. I know that between her exquisite technique and excellent instruction, this will be easy to follow, challenging, and utterly rewarding. I may even get around to looking at the yoga portions at some point.",1198800000,6,981,4.868263473053892
2699302,2,B000KZRP12,I'm not clear why this video got so many 5 star reviews.  I have been a yoga practitioner for many years and Ariellah's style of yoga is really just not very good.  The belly dancing doesn't really make up for it.,1197676800,7,213,4.170731707317073
2699303,3,B000KZRP12,"Not only did I REALLY want to like this video, but I've given it every opportunity to prove to me that it's great. The truth of the matter is, it's the little things that keep it from a five-star.

The majority of the music is awful (think operatic Depeche Mode and worse) and it is terribly distracting from Ariellah's generally thorough instruction; so-much-so that I can't concentrate on the drills (which is why 2 stars were deducted - it's THAT distracting)! This is supposed to be a video for contemporary belly dance (as is stated in the title) but the majority of the music suggests that it is only for the Gothic style.

Other than that, there are just a few places where I think the instruction could have been clearer, but overall I'd say Ariellah's instruction and explanations are clear and well thought out. In fact, I'd go so far as to say she has the clearest explanations of how movements are made than any other instructor that I have encountered.

Long story short, for the money, this is a great value! Ariellah's yoga practices alone are worth the price of the DVD but the amount of drilling (75 minutes!) are phenomenal, that is, if you can get past the music.",1195516800,22,1182,4.566037735849057
2699304,3,B000KZRP12,"I got this based on the unusually high number of rave reviews. The yoga section is too long and slow (for me), but it is relaxing.

2699305,5,B000KZRP12,"I love the isolation exercises.  She explains everything well, reminds you to keep the appropriate posture while doing the exercises and really makes you work.

The drills and the combinations are explained clearly and in detail and hence easy to follow. Ariellah also provides a rhythmic count for the individual sections for less experienced dancers.

A must have for every tribal enthusiast!",1191283200,2,344,4.913793103448276
2699307,3,B000KZRP12,"Well, I got this as a gift, and I was really excited to try it.  I consider myself pretty coordinated and not easily frustrated with dance, but I was easily discouraged with the bellydance drills.  There is not a lot of explanation regarding how to move body parts a certain way.  I kept at it and by the third or fourth time, I started to figure it out.  I still can't do a lot of the moves at the fastest speed, but the drills always start at a slow tempo, so I can stick to whatever speed works.  Even doing that, I really feel my muscles later, so I know it is working.  So, after an initially frustrating experience, I have learned to enjoy this DVD.  The yoga session is awesome!  It's energizing and relaxing at the same time.
If you already know bellydance, this is a great DVD.  It's probably not recommended for true beginners to dance or if you are not that coordinated.",1191196800,39,881,4.290909090909091
2699308,3,B000KZRP12,"Comparing this DVD to Rachel Brice's yoga/belly dance combination, I have to say that Ariellah tries to INTEGRATE yoga and belly dance, but with limited success.  If I'm going to practice with a tape, I'd rather go with Brice's separate drills until someone comes up with a workout that combines the two elements better than Ariellah does.",1189987200,9,339,4.947368421052632

2699310,5,B000KZRP12,"This dvd breaks down the moves the best. I am a belly dancer that does fusion style. I thought her arm drills were great for refining my arm movements, since that is my weak area. She is also good at reminding you to check your posture. If you can't do full yoga poses she tells you how to alter them slightly. You will definatly get a work out with this DVD. The drills are longer and well explained. If you are a beginner dancer though you should get Neon's Crash course belly dancer. It has graphics to show you how your hips and legs should be moving.",1189468800,,555,4.196261682242991

2699312,5,B000KZRP12,"I am a beginner, and now a fan of videos produced by World Dance New York, as I have been able to learn quite a bit from their Tribal Belly Dance line. Yoga for Dance intrigued me (I love both), and I was not disappointed.
I love Ariellah's style, and her method of teaching isolation movements is clear, precise - and exhausting. Many moves are deceptively difficult, and after a few minutes my body screams! Her emphasis on posture and ""home position"" is wonderful, and that posture actually eases much of my chronic back pain. The constant reminders to keep arms energised, creates a workout equal to lifting weights, and urges 'energy' all the way out to the fingertips. No laziness allowed!
The yoga cooldown, I find a bit inadequate after doing both sets of drill practices, so I go back to the 'short' yoga warm-up to augment. Not a big complaint, as with the organisation of the video it is easy to mix'n'match. The performances are gorgeous, the music is from my favourite genre (goth/industrial/ambient), and it is so considerate to include the credits so I know what to get.
As for the choreography - yea right! It's gonna take me alot more practice to lay that down proper, and I will enjoy every minute and misstep.
Very good value for the money, highly recommend to all interested in a more post-modern tribal style.",1188518400,4,1330,4.663829787234042
2699313,1,B000KZRP12,"This may be a great introduction to belly dance, but I will never find out as Ariellah gives me the creeps.  I may be too old and to Midwest to see beyond her tatoos and vampire wannabe makeup. This DVD is going in the garage sale pile.",1188432000,8,236,4.0212765957446805

I have about 25 different titles, and I have learned valuable lessons from nearly every one of them.  However, I have gained more strength and flexibility in my arms, chest, back, and hips by regular practice of Ariellah's techniques drilling.  I feel and look better than ever and have gained mastery over movements I could not do before.  Yahoo!",1188172800,9,451,4.743589743589744
2699315,5,B000KZRP12,"I liked this video for 3 reasons.  1.  The drills - she did a movement - told you why it is important to do it properly - then repeated the movement over and over.  2.  Her dance performances at the end of the video are inspirational. Her choreography was fabulous and her movements were in sync with the music.  3.  The music that accompanies the instruction introduced me to a new genre of music.  I love the middle eastern beats mixed with synthetic sounds.
This video is a wonderful example of tribal fusion at its best.",1186963200,7,524,4.395833333333333
2699316,4,B000KZRP12,"The first thing i loved about this was the music. I love gothic music, but i think it's mild enough to have mass appeal even though i noted some other reviewers couldn't deal with it. It sets the perfect mood for the movements.
The other thing i loved about this was that i actually felt like my body was really working. Though i might not have gotten the movements down pat i could still get the workout. I love the fact that my arms were aching by the time i was done drilling.

I also love that Ariellah gives not only the ""how"" of movement, but the ""why"" as well. By that i mean she often says things like, ""You'll want to do it this way because when we work on chest movements you can do them more easily at the same time."" That's great incentive to get the movement right if you're a little discouraged. She also continually goes over common mistakes, and reminds you to check your posture just when you need it most. There's also a short intro to basic bellydance position and posture which is a must for beginners.

I absolutely LOVE the yoga warm up and cool down. I mean, i like yoga anyways...but no matter what workout you're doing nothing beats a sun salutation variation/warrior pose to get you in the right mentality to begin a workout. And the stretches! I love the stretches!! I feel the need to again emphasize i love the music. It blends so perfectly with the movements.

Lastly, i love Ariellah as an instructor. I'm not a bellydance expert, but her technique to me is exquisite. She is also a classically trained dancer. Wonderful and inspiring to watch. Asharah put out a similar video for this tribal bellydance line...and the one thing I noticed right off the bat was that her movements seemed so much sloppier compared to Ariellah.",1186185600,16,1756,4.48125
2699317,5,B000KZRP12,"Ariellah is a petite dynamo who in her ""Welcome"" on this excellent DVD tells how yoga and belly dance can be related, and how yoga helps one to do the  isolations, which Ariellah teaches in slow motion and with exact precision in her Technique Drills. She says that yoga also brings strength and energy, and heightened awareness that can be applied to belly dancing. All the yoga and bellydancing is done slowly on this DVD, and gives the impression that it is easier than it actually is, though even if you are a beginner, and you listen to your body and only do as much as you can, you will find the exercises and drills challenging and rewarding.

The DVD is well produced and takes place on a bare stage setting that is a good contrast to Ariellah's black leotards, making it easy to see each movement; you have the choice of a Short or Full yoga warm-up (the ""Full"" isn't necessarily harder, it is just longer and has a different selection of movements) and there is also a wonderful ""Yoga Cool Down"" at the very end. After the Drills there is Choreography to learn, and then Combination Practice, repeated so you can practice until perfect. Best of all perhaps are the performances, With Ariellah in her unique and fantastic costumes, spellbinding with her incredible agility and technique in 3 aesthetically beautiful numbers.

Whether you just want to have a terrific yoga workout, or learn the basics of bellydance isolation taught by a master, or get the best of both worlds, Ariellah's Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga Conditioning is 150 minutes of a winning combination and a great addition to anyone's dance instruction DVD library.",1185321600,41,1647,4.771929824561403

Thank you Ariellah. I really like the 3 performances at the end - heck, good dancing is good dancing. The music is just OK for that, but I like more traditional. Also, shame on me, I skipped the yoga even though I know I should be doing it, but was too anxious to get the the BD techniques which as I said were just great and really helpful.
