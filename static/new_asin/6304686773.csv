In the Jap version they had original music by artists that contributed in the show, but in the english it was mute but only the music went on. The Theme songs are still the same dumb english version when the jap version changes theme intro and song. This version is also has alot of bad dubbing. The only english versions worth watching was episodes 1-12.",982368000,,451,4.512195121951219
