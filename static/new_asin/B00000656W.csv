7903796,5,B00000656W,"The 1986 documentary film by Bud Greenspan about the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, United States has for many become the benchmark by which all other sports documentaries are measured against. The late Jonah J. ""Bud"" Greenspan was a master of the sports documentary and produced a number of similar documentaries but 16 Days of Glory is the jewel in the crown. Few documentaries have been able to capture the personalities and their personal journey's so well. With great music and narration, you soon fall under this documentaries spell and become hooked on Bud Greenspan's work.",1485216000,,599,5.122448979591836
