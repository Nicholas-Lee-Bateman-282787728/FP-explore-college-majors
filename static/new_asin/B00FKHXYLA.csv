He is the king of Rock in Brazil with many natinal anthems like Metamorfose Ambulante, Gita and Sociedade Alternativa!!! Wow!!! I am the first to review this magic documentary.....I guess most people in the world don't even know the existence of Raul, but for me he is the one!!! Highly recommended for every one who likes Rock n Roll!!!! Well done, Raul!!!!!",1467158400,,448,4.907894736842105
