8294007,5,B001DL9DY4,"This is a great Christian video set for babies to preschoolers.  I first bought Little Moses at a garage sale.  At first I thought it was a little cheesy but I like it.  The kids loved it from the beginning.  So I decided to get the box set from Amazon.  It teaches a simplified version of the stories of Ruth, Joseph, Noah, and Joseph, as mixes in numbers, colors, animals, and respecting your family.  Good investment.",1321142400,2,420,4.4605263157894735
8294008,5,B001DL9DY4,"My 13 month old likes these movies. As he gets older, he is starting to like them more and more. I wanted something educational and bible based and this is it. I'm not too entertained as the voices are a little too monotone, but he seems to not mind them!",1312243200,,255,4.12
8294009,3,B001DL9DY4,"little leaders is a bible based series of dvds that plays in 4 languages and has a bonus section that teaches different asl signs. it's a cute series but I think would be best for very young children. I would say not over 15 months probably. My 2.5 year old thought it was neat, but wasn't really interested. They sorta remind me of a biblical baby einstien (although I have no idea which series came first so I suppose it might be the other way around).",1262995200,2,454,4.290697674418604
8294010,5,B001DL9DY4,"I saw the review that was talking about the low quality.  I had some of the older Little Leaders dvds from a couple of years ago when my nephew was of this age group.  They were obviously low budget.  Now my niece is into Little Leaders, so I recently got these new ones for her to enjoy.  Wow..what a difference!  They are awesome!  She won't watch anything else.  The animations are very well done, and it's just so nice to see how this company has developed.  I love the sign language and the fact that it comes with different language options.  I'm happy to support good quality educational content for the little ones.",1259625600,4,623,4.442477876106195
8294011,5,B001DL9DY4,"I'ma mother of three and when my oldest was a toddler we had some original Little Leaders from several years ago. He really like them!  Now that I have 2 more daughters, we have the newer versions of Little Leaders and they will not watch any other Dvd's. These newer ones are great!! A must see for your little one :)",1258848000,,318,4.213114754098361
8294012,2,B001DL9DY4,"The quality of these dvd's is not very good.  Some of the real images of animals are nice, but the animation and drawings look like they were done with the Paintbrush program.  It was actually humorous how bad the characters and drawings were.  It is obvious they tried to copy off of baby einstein (which I have no problem with), but they failed miserably.  I would recommend babyfaith or baby miracle dvd's over this brand.",1241654400,,425,4.626666666666667
