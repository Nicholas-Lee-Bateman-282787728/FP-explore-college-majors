David is very personable and sure knows how to work with dogs.
A very intertaining and informative tape for anyone who has a dog and wants to learn how to train it.",1246492800,3,211,4.170731707317073
2331816,5,B0009X0TVI,"I used this system with my Rottweiler when she was a puppy back in '97.  This system was easy simple and very effective.  She is the best trained dog I've ever had.  No leash required...ever!  I have been looking for this tape again, so I can use it to train my next puppy.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who does not have experience with training.  I can not say any more than I am going to buy this product again.",1205798400,4,427,4.146341463414634
2331817,5,B0009X0TVI,"In his Command Performance series, Dikeman demonstrates both positive reinforcement and mild corrections in dog training techniques. His presentation is pleasant and easy to understand, and his directions are easy to follow.",1185840000,5,224,6.03125
2331818,5,B0009X0TVI,"One of the best thing about David's method is you get instant gratification. No kidding. First lesson, using a 20 foot leash, and you will have your dog at a heal after about 10 minutes. Jumping up on you or family? Cure that in about :30 seconds. All done humanely, so you don't feel like you're 'hurting him.'

I trained my lab using these tapes, and it was amazing. Both you and Fido will be so much happier. Don't hesitate, buy this.",1172966400,16,437,4.329268292682927

Bottom Line :

If you have a dog and want to train the dogs well use it PERIOD !

8068827,5,B0009X0TVI,It is a must and we use it faithfully.  Our other puppy (12yrs. ago) was a very timid and shy and she coulddn't respond just as she should have but did very well.  Now we are waiting for our next puppy to be born and look to have her/him sometime in mid to late Dec.  We were wondering if you had anything in regards to house breaking.  That would be VERY HELPFULL.  Donn and Laura,1381622400,,381,4.026666666666666
8068828,5,B0009X0TVI,"When I got my first lab I got this tape, YOU MUST BUY THIS!!!!  You will love it...It will teach YOU how to train your dog or any dog you meet. It won't train your dog for you, you still have to do the work, but this tape will show you how to do it. Every thing I could say about this tape has been said. This tape helped me to train my dog so well people wanted to take him home.....You will feel so good when you walk by a person and you here them say Wow! nice dog....
Like I said, YOU will learn how to train your dog, and all the dogs you have after the dog now. Its realy wounderful to have a well trained dog...  If your looking to train your dog yourself, this is the tape to get...",1371168000,,690,3.7847222222222223
8068829,5,B0009X0TVI,"I have used these exercises on several dogs and all have responded positively. Very happy with my purchase, and I recommend it to my friends.",1367280000,2,141,4.68
8068830,5,B0009X0TVI,"I bought these tapes back in the 90s for my then girlfriend's puppy. We trained the dog through most of the system, but then got a little less disciplined (lazy) toward the end. Regardless, her dog was amazingly well behaved after just the first few lessons. We were able to walk the dog out in public with just her collar tab on without fear that she'd run off or get in to trouble. i remember having her sit stay out in front of the store as i browsed through the store all while looking through the window to make sure she didn't leave her place. often she would stiff at and let passerbys pet her, but she never moved from her spot out front.

The second time I used the system was for my friend's black lab puppy. This dog had a lot of energy, and always wanted to jump on everyone and give them ""kisses"". I trained the dog all the way up to sit stays, but then I got to busy to do any more than that. But really that made all the difference for this dog.

the third time i used the system was for my sister's weimaraner/yellow lab mix and my roommate's rhodesian ridgeback mix. these were already older dogs...both over 8 years old. but i was able to teach both dog's how to heed my commands. whoever said ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"" was definitely wrong!

i've used this system so many times that i pretty much have all the basics in memory, but i do love to go back and watch the tapes...even if i don't have a dog myself at this time...the tapes are entertaining to me...lol.

The things that I liked most about the dog training system (philosophy) are:

* you don't use any treats
* your dog learns to perform the command immediately, not after you give the command 5 times...""sit...Sit...SIT...SIT! SIT!!!""
* you teach your dog to pay attention to you and where you are at at all times
* the progression from sit to down to sit/down stays are easy to follow (for trainer and dog)
* the tapes are fun to watch...David's humor in some of the clips still makes me laugh
* most if not all dog training issues are covered in the tapes
* with any system, consistency and diligence from the trainer is a must...David's system provides all the tools for you and your dog to be successful

This system is not only for dog owner's but also for parents...lol. I admit that I got a lot of my parenting style from the lessons I learned from these tapes. My first daughter is now 7 years old, but this is some of the things i did with her from the time she was born:
* give the command and then teach the desired response first: i think every parent does this already. i think parents make the mistake of thinking a child already ""knows"" what you want them to do simply because they've followed your requests flawlessly before. however, even though they are able to ""repeat"" or ""mimic"" your desired response, they most likely don't fully understand what they are doing yet. of course this depends on how old your child is and how developed their brain is, but i always try and assume that if my daughter(s) don't follow a command/request it is because they need more reinforcement of the task, not because they are out to disobey me...so i keep modeling the act i want them to do.

* give a command once, then correct: this is where many parents go wrong, and then wonder why their kids don't follow their requests/orders. i used to do this with my oldest daughter when we were at the park. i would call her over to me (for no real reason other than i want her to come over to me) when she was playing at the playground. if she came over immediately, i would praise her, but if she was distracted with something else and she didn't come over i would go and pull her over and correct her by telling her that i need her to pay attention for when i called for her. after she got used to me doing this, i'd be able to call out her name in a very crowded playground and she'd come running over. then i'd thank her for coming over so quickly and tell her that i just wanted to give her a kiss :)

* give the correction immediately: this is another thing i see a lot of parents doing wrong. if you give a warning or ""threat"" of time out or of some kind of punishment, then you need to follow through with it immediately or you will send your child mixed messages.

* do not use ""treats"" to make the student (your child) perform: this builds your child's confidence and self esteem...accomplishing something with out an external reward.

my second daughter, almost two years old, is a little more ""strong-willed"" than my first, so we'll see how my ""parenting style"" works this second time around :)

these really are great tapes. actually out of all the vhs tapes i saved from my old collection are these tapes...i threw away or gave away all the others! that should show you how valuable i think these tapes are!

take it from me: your dog(s) AND your kid(s) will thank you for buying these tapes

p.s. dare i say this philosophy can be used on your...spouse??! lol",1360972800,,4967,4.310825294748124
8068831,1,B0009X0TVI,The tape inside the VHS was cut and we did not get the first four lessons. I feel as though I've been ripped off. Awful Product!,1355184000,,128,3.9615384615384617
8068832,5,B0009X0TVI,"We first bought this system to train our cocker spaniel who was a free spirit and had no manners.  We followed the training very closely.  It does take time but it does work.  You get this bond with your dog that lasts a lifetime.  It is humane and the results are wonderful.  We have trained 2 other puppies with this system.  Love it.

For our other two dogs we went to classes.  We got results but that trainer was really kind of mean. Hated it.

If we hadn't lent out our Command Performance system we would have used it instead. That is why I had to buy it again for our latest pup. When you buy this system you better buy 2, 1 for you and 1 to lend out.",1332288000,2,659,4.007692307692308
8068833,5,B0009X0TVI,Trained several dogs with this system over the years.  Had to replace lost videos so I could train the 3 puppies we got recently.  I didn't think of buying any other training program.,1277164800,,183,4.515151515151516
8068834,1,B0009X0TVI,"Hey, I think this is the best program on the market in the last 20 years!

Also on Amazon is the DVD Version of this training system -just enter command performance dog training DVD in your search.

Does anyone still have a VHS????  LOL!",1273449600,,237,4.340909090909091
8068835,5,B0009X0TVI,"We bought these videos back in 1996 when we had a Lab and a new Beagle.  We trained the Lab, who was 6 at the time, in a matter of minutes to pay attention to where we were.  The Beagle was just a puppy, but he learned rather quickly too. Literally, within a month, the dogs were both well trained enough to be able to make them mind.  We have since trained another Beagle as well.  We never made it all the way through the training to be able to walk the dogs in public down a busy street, but just in video one you'll be able to get the dogs to walk with you and pay attention, come when you call them, and stay when they are told.  You will not be disappointed.",1262822400,4,664,3.925373134328358
8068836,5,B0009X0TVI,"We LOVE this video!  The format and information is simple to follow, well explained AND demonstrated with just the right amount of detail.  David Dikeman is also funny and clearly respects animals, which makes this a very enjoyable video to watch.  Can't wait to try this program!",1259539200,2,280,4.914893617021277
