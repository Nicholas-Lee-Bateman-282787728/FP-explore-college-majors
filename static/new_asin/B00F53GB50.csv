8612360,5,B00F53GB50,"This is a very good quality DVD transfer of an extremely rare film that was never released on home video in the US. You'll need a multi-standard DVD deck in order to view it, as this is in Australian PAL format.  The image is anamorphic widescreen.  This is the reissue cut of 81 minutes.  Apparently, the much earlier version of the film, under the title LIKE FATHER LIKE SON, ran closer to 91 minutes.

The movie was originally filmed as early as 1960.  For that era, the film is surprising frank about sexuality among youths.  Tom Laughlin plays a student-athlete who enjoys a typical friendship with a stereotypical ""good girl"" (Stefanie Powers).  However, he's briefly seduced by a ""bad girl"" (in a church loft, no less).  The ""good girl/bad girl"" dynamic was typical of that era, but there's even some dialog suggesting that the ""good girl"" is experienced as well.  That is certainly a contrast with most of the youth films of the era, in which the girls were either experienced or virginal.  Much of the film centers on Laughlin questioning his own faith and values, so this is a soul-searching drama.  The movie should primarily appeal to Laughlin completists and to those who favor youth pictures from the early 1960's.",1434067200,2,1228,4.7725118483412325
