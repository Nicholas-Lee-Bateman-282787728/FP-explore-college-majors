2630240,5,B000H6SY1Y,"It's hard to believe it's been a dozen years since James Lipton started his seminal interview series on the Bravo cable network, ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" but it has proven to be one of the more substantive entries in the talk show genre. With one guest per show, the focus has always been on the professional dimension, specifically on the craft of acting as experienced by the subject. Recently, in an obvious attempt to attract broader audiences, Lipton has been recruiting younger, relatively unproven talents with meager track records, and the results have been less than revelatory. Fortunately, this three-disc DVD set shows how good the show can be when the subject has already reached legendary status.

Four figures, all past their sixtieth birthdays and all prominent film stars who have worn multiple hats over the past half-century, are spotlighted here - Paul Newman from 1994, Barbra Streisand and Clint Eastwood from 2003 and Robert Redford from 2004. As proven clearly with these interviews, Lipton has been amazingly consistent with each show beginning with the sometimes mind-numbing depth of research he gathers in preparation, i.e., his voluminous stack of blue index cards. He starts the conversation by probing the guest about his or her origins and tracking them chronologically through personal and professional milestones and achievements. The difference between Lipton and other talk show hosts is that he does not dwell on tabloid gossip or personal exposs but rather draws out what it took for the actor to achieve certain noteworthy performances or accomplishments.

Each star reveals quite a bit of his or her creative process along the way, and much of the credit for the disclosures has to be given to Lipton. Even though he can come across as a pompous sycophant, he compensates by eliciting truly fascinating responses from his subjects. As the first guest of the series and the only one of the four who is an actual Actors Studio alumnus, Newman is inevitably the most fluent when discussing acting techniques and characteristically the most modest about his talents. Both Redford and Eastwood get more animated talking about their roles as filmmakers than actors, though both share generous amounts of information about their years of struggle.

Unsurprisingly, the Streisand interview is the most wide-ranging since a particularly worshipful Lipton and she discuss her singing career and politics as much as her acting and filmmaking ventures. Of course, all four are subjected to the familiar Bernard Pivot questionnaire, which yields some insightful responses despite its veneer of pretense, and this is followed by a more open-ended Q&A with the drama school students. The 2006 DVD set includes Lipton's erudite introductions to each interview. Except for Streisand, there are also excised moments included as a bonus feature for each of the subjects called ""Great Moments That Didn't Make the Cut"". The footage is marginally entertaining, but the edits were wisely made for the most part.",1164931200,44,3032,5.234567901234568
2630241,2,B000H6SY1Y,"I enjoyed the Newman and Redford interviews immensely. They have interesting things to say and don't talk about themselves, themselves, themselves, themselves!

The same can not be said for Ms. Striesand, however. Me, me, me, I, I, I, I, look at me, hear me, listen to me, watch ME ME ME. It's kinda sickening.

Consider the masters and the geniuses that have collaborated with Ms. Striesand. Do they get any mention? Any credit? Any thanks? I would have LOVED to hear about James Wong Howe, or Paul Williams, or any one of the dozens of creative geniuses who made her look so much better than she actually is. Bot no. She apparently gets off on presenting her ""career"" as something she achieved all by herself!

NOT>

And I almost fell out of my chair at the end when Lipton asks the ""Five Questions."" When he asks her what job she would like to do LEAST, she says ""Be a podiatrist. Working with people's feet? ICKKKK!""

Did she REALLY do that? Did she REALLY alienate and offend every decent, worthwhile, necessary,vitally important,hard-working and tax-paying American foot doctor in her fan-base?????

I was MORTIFIED. My podiatrist is a GODSEND. I would buy his albums over Striesand's any day. If he recorded. But he doesn't. He's too busy helping people. Ahem.

Anyway, in summary; the interviews with the men are good. Striesand, sadly, manages to take all womanhood down a notch, and she does it in under an hour.

Shame.",1349913600,2,1430,4.761133603238866
2630242,5,B000H6SY1Y,"Product came as advertised: 'brand new, in wrapper'.  All this for $4.50!  What a deal...postage was almost as much.  Thanks!",1320796800,,125,5.15
2630243,5,B000H6SY1Y,"These are classic interviews on James Lipton's ""Inside the Actor's Studio."" These particular actors are/were known not to give many interviews or make personal appearances on talk shows, mainly because they didn't feel they were very good at it. But these conversations are priceless, especially for anyone in show business. This DVD has become a prized possession in my collection. It's a treasure.",1292976000,,399,5.349206349206349
2630244,5,B000H6SY1Y,"James Lipton has a style and parameters in his interviews that are so professional and warm that he draws most celebrities out. There are no juicy bits or gossip, just great discussions of professional thoughts and memories relating to movies and stage performances. I purchased this because of Paul Neuman and Robert Redford and got a bonus of Clint Eastwood. Barbra Streisand's interview was ok, but the other three are unaffected and interesting. Neuman's and Redford's interviews have an overlap that is quite funny and brings out the close and humorous relationship they shared over the years. I highly recommend this collection, since 3 of 4 is a good percentage of enjoyable entertainment.",1262822400,,696,5.168141592920354
2630245,4,B000H6SY1Y,"I'm a huge Actors Studio fan. As easy as it is to make fun of Dean Lipton, I think he does a great job of stepping out of the way and letting the actors shine with their answers. Really loved the men on this collection. The Newman interview is one of my favs. Redford and Eastwood also have interesting stories to share of their rise to stardom.

I'm gonna give it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of Barbara. Listen, the woman has talent, a great story, etc. But it's hard not to laugh at those nails and some of her mannerisms. But I admire her talent and career.

I just PRAY all the Actor Studio episodes are released at some point. For now, this will do.",1227916800,,660,4.1484375
2630246,5,B000H6SY1Y,"I can't add much more than the others above, they're right on target.  There couldn't have been a more appropriate premier guest than Newman.  Watching him and listening to him relate his career is revealing and humbling.  One of the most selfless, honest, and generous people we'll ever know.  And the workshop segment (something I'd like to see more of), working, acting, coaching the students - total grace.  He worked with the class as if he knew them for years, - as if he was just another student himself. The students in that class, in that short time, probably learned more about the craft AND more about themselves, than they'll ever get in the rest of their lives.

A seminal moment in television.

Thank-you, Mr. Newman.",1222473600,3,731,4.753968253968254

2630248,3,B000H6SY1Y,"James Lipton continues NOT to inspire us with his ""and then I wrote"" questions which these four great stars answer with ""real"" candor. This is not news or even inquiry, but simply entertainment. Moments of honesty are rare when the host never asks any probing questions. However, if you are a fan of any of these true Idols of America it is a must have in you collection.",1183161600,5,371,4.470588235294118
2630249,5,B000H6SY1Y,If you have watched the series on Bravo - you know that these are great programs.  Good enough to watch several times - as these are classic actors with a lot of great experiences to share.  Highly recommended!,1171324800,10,210,4.5
2630250,4,B000H6SY1Y,"Newman, Redford, Streisand, and Eastwood!  Only thing better would have been having all four together on stage.  At least some previously unseen moments from the Streisand show would have been worth including.  Savor every interesting minute of these interviews.",1168473600,13,262,5.666666666666667
8137280,2,B000H6SY1Y,"I used to watch this series. I watched it for the guests. I found it kind of fun. However, Mr. Lipton speaks in a one tone voice. He never seems to smile or joke. His interview style is stiff. Also, what is it with his question about the star's favorite word? It is an ok series however. This is all  IMO.",1507593600,,305,4.0

8137283,5,B000H6SY1Y,"There is no other word than superlative to describe James Lipton's talent for drawing out small vagaries from public persons who have honed their skills at concealing from the public the details that Lipton succeeds in revealing.  He is at times ingenuous and ingenious in his skills at interviewing.  It really does not matter which famous person sits across from him. His results are ALWAYS supreme. I was lucky enough to be able to buy all shows that have been made available through 'Shout"", the company responsible for creating the DVDs for us to buy.  The DVD's are the same shows as the shows aired on Bravo.  I suspect the limits are due to production details. I do not know.  I have had the pleasure of Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Robert DeNiro, and Robin Williams all spending time in my home.  The experience is priceless, and I can replay them ad infinitum to my heart's content!  Bravo to Bravo!!",1428192000,2,928,4.726708074534161
