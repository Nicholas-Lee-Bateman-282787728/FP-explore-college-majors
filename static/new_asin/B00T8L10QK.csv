8700944,5,B00T8L10QK,"In many ways, Jonah is a lot darker here than in Summer Heights High. There's is no comic foil like Mr. G to break the mood, and as in Angry Boys, Lilley has a bit of social commentary to give Jonah, at times, the gravitas of a tragic figure. That said, Lilley continues to be one of the smartest writers for television: he captures the state of the high school experience: there's is a lot to laugh about, but there are also times when one worries that it can all go very dark very quickly. He's smart enough to limit the piece to six episodes. If you've seen Lilley's earlier work, you're bound to enjoy this as well; if you're new to his work, you might want to start with some of his earlier work.",1468368000,,701,4.2
