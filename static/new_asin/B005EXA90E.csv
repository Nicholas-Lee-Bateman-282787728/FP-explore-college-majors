8469210,5,B005EXA90E,This is a great film from 1938. Very zany but somehow original. Look out for a young Ronald Reagan in an early acting role. One of the best things about this movie is the Wonderful score by the great Richard A. Whiting and Johnny Mercer. Whiting unfortunately died while the film was in production and was unable to complete the entire soundtrack. This movie ranks quite high on the list for Whiting's best musical scores as well as for originality and overall fun.,1364083200,2,465,4.614457831325301
