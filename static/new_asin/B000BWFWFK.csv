2443564,5,B000BWFWFK,"I started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer a few months ago on DVD, and then

moved on to Angel when I was in the fifth season of Buffy. As much as I love

Buffy and would give that a high rating as well, Angel is even better. It's

funny at times, dark at others, and the character of Angel is excellent. He's

a bit like a concoction between Blade and Batman. He's heroic and yet has his

moments of darkness here and there. Every season is great, I'd say the fourth

is the weakest, although still quite good, and the fifth is by far the best.",1167782400,,547,4.113207547169812
2443565,5,B000BWFWFK,"Angel ran an all too short five seasons from 1999-2004, and the now defunct WB may be defunct in part because of its decision to cancel the show. The story starts out where Buffy The Vampire Slayer season 3 left off, with Angel leaving Sunnydale and his beloved Buffy so that she can have a semblance of a normal life, or at least a normal relationship, which the two of them could never have. The entire series can be divided into three parts, all of which take place in L.A., Angel's new home.

The first part consists of season one, and is in monster-of-the-week format rather than the season-long story arcs that Joss Whedon was famous for in Buffy. In season one, Angel starts a supernatural detective agency, ""Angel Investigations"", with the help of Cordelia Chase, who has moved to L.A. after her family lost all of their money the previous year, and half human-half demon Doyle. Doyle dies a courageous death half-way through the season, and Wesley Windham-Pryce joins the cast as a ""rogue demon hunter"" who has been fired from the watcher's council for the Faith debacle in Sunnydale the previous year. In this first season he is the same awkward Wesley we saw in season three of BTVS, but that eventually changes. At the end of the season we are introduced to Charles Gunn, a streetwise kid who has been fighting demons his whole life and ekeing out a meager existence on the street. Slowly, he comes to trust Angel and eventually joins the group.

The second part of the series consists of seasons two through four, and is literally one long story arc. Season two deals with the resurrection of Angel's vampire lover Darla, the one who turned him into a vampire in 1753, and whom he killed in season one of BTVS. The ordeal of getting Darla back as a human, and then losing her again when she becomes a vampire once more, drives Angel to the dark side of his soul. He turns against his friends for a brief time as he goes on a crusade of punishing the guilty - Wolfram & Hart - rather than helping the helpless. Eventually he has an epiphany, and returns to his friends and his senses - but not before he and Darla have a night of passion that results in season three's story arc - Darla's pregnancy and the ""birth"" of Angel's son Conner. Also, at the end of season two the Fang Gang rescues a girl (""Fred"") from an alternate dimension - Pylea - which also happens to be the home dimension of Lorne, an empath demon that has been helping Angel and his friends.

In season 3, Angel is adjusting to fatherhood when an old enemy from his vampire past is mystically conjured up - Holtz, a man whose entire family was killed by Angel and Darla when they were both vampires. Holtz uses Wesley's fear of a prophecy that ""The father shall kill the son"" to get him to steal Angel's son, whom Holtz in turn steals from Wesley. Holtz is cornered by multiple parties who also want Conner, and Holtz takes the infant and jumps into a portal to a hell dimension rather than give up the child. Later in season three, Conner and Holtz both return from the hell dimension. With time running differently in the two dimensions, Conner is now 18 years old, and none too fond of Angel, since Holtz' tales of Angel's cruelty as a vampire have doubtless been Conner's bedtime stories for his entire life. Holtz conjures up a plan to commit assisted suicide and make it look like he has been murdered by Angel so that Conner will take revenge on him. The plan works, and Conner sinks Angel to the bottom of the Pacific in a box, to suffer an everlasting torment of slow starvation.

Season four is the most misunderstood and the wildest ride of any of the seasons. In the first episode, Wesley tries to redeem himself by retrieving Angel from the bottom of the ocean after capturing Conner's accomplice in Angel's imprisonment. Cordelia was made a ""higher power"" at the end of season three, and she suddenly turns up at Angel's doorstep several episodes into season four, unable to remember anything. The rest of the season is a dizzying blur that involves a mysterious Beast that blots out the sun, the temporary unsouling of Angel so that the gang can question Angelus about his memories of the Beast, another mystical pregnancy that culminates in an evil higher power - Jasmine - coming into the world, and that evil power bringing ""world peace"" in return for the world's unquestioning worship - until Angel allows people to see Jasmine's true appearance and they run from her in horror. The season concludes with Angel and his crew being given control of the L.A. branch of evil mystical law firm Wolfram & Hart supposedly as a reward for ""destroying world peace"". Angel agrees to the deal, if in return all memories of Conner's existence are erased from everyone who knew him and if Conner is placed in a ""normal"" family with new planted memories that involve only his new family, and not his actual past. This acts as a reset for all of the emotional pain of the past three years for everyone except Angel, who retains his memories of what actually happened.

Season five basically stands alone and is the third and final part of the series. This final season returns more to the monster-of-the-week format that was present in season one, largely as a condition of WB renewing the show since the confusing labrynth that was season four had not had stellar ratings. Spike, from the now defunct BTVS, is thrown into the mix, at first as a ghost that is unable to leave the premises of Wolfram & Hart. Later in the season Spike reclaims his corporeal presence, though. The first part of the season is on the light side, as each member of the Fang Gang receives their dream job on a platter at Wolfram & Hart, with all of the resources they could ever ask, and the hope of doing good deeds in a place once renowned for evil. Later though, they slowly discover that is they that are being changed and compromised, not the law firm. This culminates in one great tragedy two-thirds into the season, resulting in the death of one the members of the Fang Gang. In the end, Angel and his crew decide to turn the tables and strike at the heart of the players in the Apocalypse by killing all of the members of an evil secret society. They are successful, but there are casualties among their ranks. The last scene shows the survivors cornered in an alley about to be attacked by Wolfram & Hart's minions. When asked what they should do, the last line of the show is Angel telling the others ""Well, Personally? I Kinda Wanna Slay the Dragon."" as he swings a sword and we fade to black. The Fang Gang goes out fighting and we never really know what happened to them, and because the actors have long since gone on to other projects, we never will.

""Angel"" is adult fare from start to finish, not the teen fare of at least the early years of Buffy. However, Joss Whedon's epic tale of a vampire with a soul and his search for redemption is great television. Angel is not the only character on a journey in this series. Throughout the tenure of the show we watch the shallow and selfish Cordelia Chase change into a brave soul who is willing to become part demon in order to continue on in her mission. We also watch as Wesley changes from buffoonish comic relief into a true rogue demon hunter who has a penchant for darkness that rivals Angel. Charles Gunn changes from the street-wise kid who is proud of being the muscle into someone who is willing to sell his soul to not to return to that role. Even Lorne is not spared, as he changes from the consummate entertainer with an ever-sunny personality into someone who can only find solace at the bottom of a glass of alcohol and loses his heart for the good fight ""the moment I found out a girl I loved was going to die"".",1166832000,45,7753,4.502840909090909
2443566,5,B000BWFWFK,"Angel will always be remember as the most break through show ever made for its storyarcs, characters, symbolism, drama etc

juss wanna point out some highlights from each season:

season one: when I think of what are some the best stuff from season one, my thought instantly goes to Five By Five/Santuary, although of course that is the least of the goodies. But Angel's wisdom and angelic qualities are almost SUMMARIZED in these two 2-part episodes.
""so I'm free?""- Faith
""Don't know about that, but the door is open.""- Angel
Faith walks out Angel follows
""what are you gonna do? walk out into that darkness? I once told you you don't have to go into that darkness remember? Said it was your choice. Well you chose. Five by five right Faith? But it swallowed you whole. So tell me, how did you like it?""
Faith punch Angel on the face
""Help me.""
""Yeah.""

season two: The Darla arcs still remain to be one of the hightlights of the series. The fact that Angel changed so much just the experience with this single person is thought-provoking. It showed his obsession, his darkness, his caring, and his epiphany.
""Look, no matter how good a boy you are, God doesn't want you! But I still do""- Dear Boy
""Favor? Is that what you think? you think you did me a favor? you damned me!""- Darla
""I'm not gonna leave you, every moment you have left, I'll be at your side, you'll never be alone again""- The Trial
""If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do, now today, the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world""- Epiphany

Season three: Darla's sacrifice, and Wesley's betrayal instantly jumps out as this season's strong points. This season is where everything that could go wrong went wrong, and the role each character plays to either provoke it, or fight it.
""this child, Angel, is the one good thing we have ever done, the ONLY good thing, you be sure to tell him that.""- Lullaby
""you think you know something about living because you had this really long life, but then one day you wake up, and find that you have something else...I had a son""- Double Or Nothing

Season Four: The darkest of all the seasons. The writers of Angel brilliantly let this season to be the big bad happening instead of the last season, or that every season there is a BIG ending (this is also one major difference from Buffy, in which every seasons of Buffy Buffy has to stop a big bad at the end of the season). Angel's leadership shone out brightly in this season, that the Fang Gang just could not make it out if it weren't for him, and of course, that brilliantly tragic and bittersweet ending of Home, what I consider the saddest storyline I have EVER seen that doesn't involve a single death- sounds impossible? well see it for yourself, if you don't cry after watching Home, I would seriously consider that either you don't get it or you have no soul- I'm serious.
""nothing in this world is the way it ought to be, it's harsh and cruel. That's why there's us, Champions. Doesn't matter where we come from, what we've done or suffered, or even if we make a difference. We live as though the world were as it should be, to show it what it can be""- Deep Down
""I know how that feels, because I want to give you everything. I want to take back the mistakes, and help you start over""- Home

Season Five: the saddest and most depressing of all the seasons. This is where the killathon is- in which Joss just decides to kill EVERY SINGLE one member of the Angel team (hehe). But the gist is, every single death was wrote heartbreaking and memorable. Our heros are sent to certain death but went out with a bang, thus Not Fade Away is the perfect title for the last episode of Angel, it concluded the show's theme. This conclusion is in my opinion, the most controversial, revolutionary and brilliant conclusion I've seen on anything. I truly believe now all the shows are copying Angel in that they are doing a cliffhanger on everything (hehe).
""We cling to what is gone, is there anything else in this world but grief?""
""there's love...and hope...for some. There's hope that your life will lead you to some joy, that after all that's happened, you may still be surprised""- Shells
""let's get to work""- Not Fade Away

Angel is just the most brilliant, thought-provoking, and memorable show I have ever seen period, it will affect people for generations to come. Long live Angel!!!!",1144454400,5,4392,4.523929471032746
2443567,5,B000BWFWFK,"okay, this is NOT fair, Buffy has the box set but Angel DOESN'T(well, if you don't count the UK one but that's still BS)????? What's up with that???? This is total biase! I'm already really really pissed that Buffy is more popular than Angel, which in my opinion, should be the other way around, Angel is a much much much better show than Buffy in consistency, storyline, mature ideas, and memoriable characters.

David Boreanaz mastered his role as Angel to ABSOLUTE perfection, he became my number one favorite actor (surprisingly too may I add) after I got addicted to Angel. Of course this is also thanks to the brlliant cast and crew and of course, the most talented writers of all time. And oh, for those of you who hasn't seen Angel or hasn't seen it all the way and judge David's performance from Buffy, I suggest you give it a second chance, he is just surprisingly good on his own show because he had much more room to expand his talent, while on Buffy he doesn't so much as showing his face, I was glad I saw Angel before Buffy, definitely NO biase from me, he is just utterly brilliant, period.

All the other characters on Angel I just liked so much better than the characters on Buffy, they are just each unique and never dull to watch. I've seen Angel the series for at least 9 times, never get sick of it.

Angel proved that the whole fantasy/Sci-fi stuff is not only teen-shows, however the channel WB has affect on people's impressions. It proved that not all fantasy-sci-fi stuff are bunch of cliches, in which on Angel you will not find ANY.

If you think this is a show about monsters, you are wrong

If you think this is a show about redemption, you are wrong

If you think this is a show about good verus evil in which good will triumph in the end, you are wrong

This is a show that has all of the above and then some, but the ""some"" parts are the ones that will not go in the direction you thought it will, I guarantee you that you will be suprised.

This is a show that will really make you laugh and really make you cry, it will carve into your flesh and bone, and make you NEVER forget it, it will make you angry, make you feel comfort, make you feel depressed, make you feel joy, and make you want more. You will not regret seeing it!",1144454400,5,2263,4.295774647887324
2443568,5,B000BWFWFK,"The Angel/Buffy verse are possibly the best thought out TV concepts of all times.  What is not to like.

I'm one of those adults who cannot get enough of Angel and I'm not exactly a TV addict.  It's not a guilty pleasure. It is intelligent and thought provoking. It's exciting, and the writing is outstanding.  I love the depth of character development, the stories, and the quirks.  The humor picks you up off the floor after the pathos breaks your heart.  Then you fall off your chair laughing.

Since the show went off the air, I have been in withdrawal.
I purchased the Buffy 'Chosen' box set as soon as it became available, and I am wearing it out.  Buffy is now the only TV show I've EVER seen all the episodes of - by a long shot.

I finally got a chance to see all the shows that aired before I started watching.  I am just dying to do the same with Angel -- which was a more adult themed show -- and until I saw all the buffy's it was my fave. yet the folks at Fox seem not to care about the fans in the US.  There are Australian AND UK versions available for sale, but here in the USA, we either have to buy the five separate seasons, or do without.  Sorry but I really don't want all those boxes now the series is complete, I just want to be able to get the whole thing without a hassle...

What did the American fans ever do to deserve this?

::EDIT::

Finally they put out a lovely box set for region 1.  Was a long wait, but well worth it.  Bought it as soon as it was available!!",1144281600,3,1494,4.079037800687285
2443569,5,B000BWFWFK,"I can't possibly sum up 5 seasons, but I can tell you this is a quality comedy/drama that should have gone on longer... If you like unusual story lines and very clever, sometimes racey adult humor, give it a try.  The title character Angel (David Boreanaz)is a spin off character from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  He is a vampire with a soul. He was once the most notorious globe trotting killer for a century until he was cursed with a soul by gypies.  Now, he fights evil demons and evil lawyers with the help and encouragement of a tight gang of ""misfits""- all very attractive by the way. This series draws a distinction between good demons and evil ones. Andy Hallet as Lorne, the sea breeze drinking lounge singer, is one such good demon and he is hysterical. In fact, most of the demons are funny.  That's the twist.
The five seasons show the same core characters facing both personal and professional challenges.... Each of the characters  learns to fight- and the fight scenes are both exciting and realistic. You will back up just to replay some of the action.  This is a great series. Watch it in sequence. The character development is amazing. From the first season to the last- each character undergoes an amazing transformation. Except Angel, he's been around for 240 years, and the change is more subtle.",1142726400,2,1316,4.675324675324675
2443570,5,B000BWFWFK,"I believe that Joss Whedon is one of the greatest (and definitely the most underrated) writers of our time.  The man is responsible for three of the greatest series of the last decade: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly.  He helped write Toy Story, wrote and directed the wonderful Serenity (a continuation of Firefly), and is a great comic book writer as well.  In his second television series, Angel (which is a spin-off of his critically-acclaimed and cult classic show Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Whedon shows us that he can take a secondary, albeit very interesting, character and develop an entire series around them.  It is very rare for spin-offs to be as highly regarded as their predecessors, with Frasier and Angel being notable exceptions.  Angel pulls it off, though.  Telling a story about redemption, vampires with souls, and life after school, Angel is as entertaining and engaging as its parent series, even if it isn't nearly as known.

*SPOILERS TO FOLLOW*

Prelude

Angel (David Boreanaz)is a 200-year-old vampire who has been cursed with a soul and conscience.  Once known as Angelus, he was one of the worst vampires in history.  He killed people for the fun of it, and not only killed them, he was a master of torture, both physical and mental.  When he killed the daughter of a Gypsy, he paid for his work by getting back his human soul, and he was forced to actually care about the atrocious things that he had done.  After about a century of brooding, self-pity, and remorse, he finally hit rock-bottom and was living on the streets in Manhattan, until a benevolent demon known as Whistler (Max Perlich) showed him Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the newest vampire slayer.  Angel fell for her, and when the two formally met, a paradoxical relationship developed.  But when the vampire and the slayer consumated their love, the unthinkable happened; the curse was broken because Angel experienced true happiness for a moment and forgot about the pain he had caused.  He reverted back to Angelus and wrought havoc throughout Sunnydale, California.  After his soul was returned, he and Buffy tried living in the same city, but it was too hard, and he decided to leave for Los Angeles.

Season 1

A few months after leaving Sunnydale, Angel has started helping people in Los Angeles, trying to redeem himself for what he did as Angelus.  After meeting up with fellow Sunnydale exile Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpentar) and another benevolent demon called Doyle (Glenn Quinn) who gets prophetic visions from the ""Powers That Be"", the trio decide to set up Angel Investigations, a paranormal detective agency.  They help people deal with problems such as demonic possessions, vampire attacks, and ghost hauntings.  Working with Kate Lockley (Elisabeth Rohm), a contact at the LAPD, Angel and company try to ""help the helpless"".  Unfortunately, Wolfram and Hart, a conduit to pure evil posing as a lawfirm, tends to cause problems for Angel.  The company is an outlet for evil, and it uses a lawfirm facade to legitimate its actions, as well as helping demons, warlocks, and other kinds of villains get out of legal trouble.  About halfway through the season, Cordelia starts receiving the visions, which start her on a path that changes her from the selfish valley girl of Buffy to a full-fleged hero, and ex-Watcher Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) joins the team.  The season studies adult issues, such as getting your first job, getting your first apartment, and being a start-up business trying to take on a large corporation.  While it is more episodic than most of the other seasons, it still is entertaining, and the final episode leaves us with a great cliffhanger.

Season 2

After learning about the Shanshu prophecy, which states that ""the vampire with a soul"" will become human again after he has redeemed himself, Angel kind of goes into overdrive trying to save as many people as he can.  He also hires Charles Gunn (J. August Richards), a street kid who fights vampires, to help out at Angel Investigations.  Meanwhile, Wolfram and Hart has resurrected Darla (Julie Benz), the vampire that sired Angel, and they plan on using her to lure Angel back to the side of evil.  Eventually, Angel begins to question if the ""little"" things he is doing are enough to redeem him, and he has a meltdown.  He decides that its time to fight a war, and begins a series of massive attacks against W&H, one of which leaves a large percentage of the senior staff dead.  In a sense, he become Angelus, but he still has a soul.  It isn't until the near-death of a friend that he realizes the true value of the little things.  The season ends with the group traveling to a world called Pylea, which is the home dimension of Lorne the Host (Andy Hallet), a demon who had been helping the team out throughout the year.  While there, they meet Winifred ""Fred"" Burkle (Amy Acker), an LA woman who was sucked into Pylea 5 years prior, and has nearly gone insane living in the world where humans are nothing but beasts of burden.

Season 3

Upon returning from Pylea, the gang found Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), one of their friends from Sunnydale, who tells them that Buffy is dead.  Distraught, Angel spent 3 months in a temple meditating on the issue.  Upon his return to LA, he soon learns that Darla is pregnant, which should be an impossibility.  Vampires are infertile, and yet he and Darla have set in motion the events of a prophecy stating that two vampires will give birth to a child.  This causes all sorts of problems for the group; Wolfram and Hart wants the child to experiment on while vampire cults think that it is some sort of deity.  Possibly worst of all, Daniel Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), a vampire hunter from 1700's England who had run-ins with Angel and Darla, has been transported to the present by Sajhaan (Jack Conley), a time-traveling demon, in order to get revenge on the pair for what they did to his family in the 18th century. Employing a group of people who have also been hurt by vampires, Holtz intends to take Connor, Angel's son.  Eventually, things get to a point where W&H, Sajhaan, Holtz, and Angel are all battling for Connor, and Holtz takes the baby to a demon dimension, never to be seen again.  Due to Wes' indirect role in the kidnapping, Angel tries to kill him, and he is ostrasized from the group.  But a few weeks later, a now teenaged Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) due to the fact that time moves differently in the other dimension, breaks back through the barrier back to LA and tries to kill Angel.  Holtz raised him to believe that Angel was a monster (which isn't completely false), and it leads to a great cliffhanger ending.

Season 4

The previous season ended with the group in shambles.  Lorne left for Las Vegas, Wesley was cut out from the group, Cordelia ascended to a higher plane of existence, and Angel was sealed in a box and dropped to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.  Meanwhile, Fred and Gunn (who have no idea what happened to Angel or Cordy) look after Connor (who is responsible for Angel, but has no knowledge of where Cordy is) and teach him how to be a good demon fighter.  Meanwhile, Wesley kidnapped Justine Holt (Laurel Holloman), Holtz's right-hand woman and lover, and is using her to find Angel.  When Angel gets back to the surface, he kicks Connor out and rejoins Fred and Gunn.  After finding out where Cordelia is, they go to Vegas to get Lorne back.  Upon their return to LA, they find Cordelia back in their hotel, but with no knowledge of who she is or who they are.  Soon, Cordy's memories are returned, Wes rejoins the group, and a monstrous Beast rises up from the ground and nearly kills every member of the group.  It effectively takes out Wolfram and Hart, and successfully blocks out the sun.  To make matters worse, the gang gets information that says that the Beast and Angelus have some sort of connection, and in order to find a way to defeat the Beast, they remove Angel's soul.  Angelus causes many more problems than he sovles, and he is soon on the loose after the Beast's mysterious master releases him.  Eventually, the goddess Jasmine, who had been pulling all the strings, is born from Cordelia and tries to take over the world... by uniting people under world peace.  By the end of the year, the gang receives a monumental offer from a former enemy.

Season 5

As a reward for ending world peace, Angel and his team are offered complete control of the LA branch of Wolfram and Hart to run any way they see fit.  They accept in order to use its infinite resources to do good.  Things seem overwhelming, but when Spike (James Marsters), another vampire who has been granted a soul, is resurrected after saving the world in the Buffy series finale, things get much more complicated.  Angel and Spike can't stand each other, and for a while, Spike is merely a ghost who can't leave W&H, and thus annoys Angel in order to pass the time.  But after becoming corporeal again, the two vampires fight over the rights to the Shanshu prophecy, only to have Spike beat Angel in a fight for the first time ever.  Fortunately for Angel, the two were set up.  Unfortunately for everyone, the man behind the events is one of Angel's old rivals.  As the season goes on, the gang find themselves making comprimises left and right, one of which leads to the death of Fred and the rising of Illyria, an ancient demon who uses Fred's body as a vessel on the Earth.  Eventually, the gang learns that tehy have been taken in by W&H, and since they are now only reacting to situations, they are no longer the heroes they once were.  This season is also fairly episodic, but the fact that there doesn't seem to be an arc turns out to be the arc (only Joss could pull that off).  Furthermore, the relationship dynamic between Angel and Spike helps elevate this season to one of the series' best.

Angel is one of the best series you've never seen.  It dealt with very real issues through wonderful metaphors.  I love how this show, along with Buffy, was more ""real"" than most other shows, many of which did not involve demons, magic, and monsters.  While it got 5 seasons, it still had a lot of stories to tell, and was cut short.  The WB made a big mistake cancelling it (especially considering everything that the show had going for it in its final year), but at least we got 5 great years.  If you have never seen Angel, now is the time to redeem yourself and catch up with all five seasons.",1141084800,13,10512,4.667028788701793
2443571,4,B000BWFWFK,"I come not to praise Angel, but to bury him (again).

First off, with the exception of the final season, commentaries and extras on these DVDs are very sparse.  Then again, some of the commentaries on season five are poorly prepared for and feature large sections of silence, so it's kind of a toss up as to which is worse.  I like the show and the creators seem like fun folks, but The Simpsons has spoiled me with the best... commentary... evar. :)

That aside, Angel was a fine show with some of the best fighting and wire work on television.  (Mike Massa = uber pimp)  It also had good drama with characters who gained a lot of depth as the series progressed.  I know TV execs like shows where nothing changes so that new viewers can tune in and immediately know everything that's going on, but I found it so much more effective to see characters with history, knowing what baggage each was bringing to the situation.

Overall, Angel was one of the best escapes on television and a series I am happy to own.",1140048000,2,1011,4.397849462365591
2443572,5,B000BWFWFK,"I recently purchased ""The Chosen Collection"" (Buffy the Vampire Slayer seasons 1-7) as well and I have to say they are both really really good. I'm pretty frugal and had to force myself to make these purchases, but I don't regret it at all.

Angel's series certainly takes a different spin than the Buffy storyline, but I was truly invested in the characters from start to finish.

If you like somewhat bizarre storylines (ie. karaoke singing demons) coupled with great fight scenes and lot's of quirky humor, you will not regret purchasing this bundle either. And quite honestly, David Boreanaz smiles more in this series--so it has to be good, right?

Thank you Joss Whedon for hours of unparalleled entertainment.

Instead I would like to review the quality of the DVD. It's like VHS quality , no 4000+p / HD here guys. Also, some of the DVDs were damaged during the recording process so some episodes are incomplete or don't show at all (2.5 episodes were affected). I would've returned it except I live overseas and you have to return the ENTIRE boxset to receive a replacement and I wasn't going to risk paying shipping and then receive another faulty product.  If you live overseas, buy them by season maybe? So there's less shipping to pay for if you need to get anything replaced.",1430611200,7,710,4.378787878787879

2443684,5,B000BWFWFK,"So far, this is performing well. Good story, good packaging, Opened the DVD box and each individual season is boxed separately.

I originally collected all of the seasons of Buffy and am now collecting Bones. I decided I needed to take a look at Angel. What I have seen so far is entertaining. As with many successful series, I know it turns weird towards the end but at less than $50 for the complete series, I will enjoy this.",1413676800,,428,4.417721518987341
2443685,3,B000BWFWFK,"""Angel"" is mindless entertainment: about half the episodes are barely watchable, about half are OK, and a handful are brilliant. It's a pale imitation of ""Buffy"" all the way down to the roles of the sidekicks and the similar plots; but while Buffy had the benefit of insight into high school/teen life, ""Angel"" has no depth. The show occupies my attention enough while working out. (I'm halfway through season 5.)

Probably the brightest spot is Cordelia, who gets the funniest lines. The worst is Connor, whose character inconsistencies defy all sense. Gunn and Fred are this series's inferior versions of Ron and Hermione... er... Xander and Willow. Angel's own character isn't bad (as Angelus he's more interesting), but he descends into impotent self-parody in some episodes.

If you can ignore the nonsensical plots that (too often) pull some mystical surprise out of nowhere to save the day, it's engaging enough to keep enough brain cells active to operate the remote.",1413072000,2,975,5.0875

2443694,5,B000BWFWFK,it is what it is.,1406246400,,17,2.6
2443695,5,B000BWFWFK,I love it! It was delivered early. The DVD's are perfect. The box that holds them all togeather is perfect. I am satisfied and impressed.,1406073600,,137,4.52
2443696,5,B000BWFWFK,We have truly been enjoying this complete set.  We turned to contrast up to 100% on the TV and found we could see so much more than original series pictures showed.  Loved the comments that gave more info about shooting the series.,1404604800,,231,4.476190476190476
2443697,5,B000BWFWFK,really love angel - looking forward to whole series.,1403654400,,52,4.888888888888889
2443698,5,B000BWFWFK,"I had been looking to replace my original box sets for a long time, and this was a great deal. The box is also very pretty and it's a nice display piece too.",1401321600,,157,3.787878787878788
2443699,3,B000BWFWFK,"Supposedly brand-new and factory-sealed, every one of these discs so far skips and stops, taking a second to start playing again. They play like very very used discs, but there are no scratches or anything like that. I'm not sure if these are bootleg copies made to look good, or what. But they certainly don't play like brand-new discs.",1401235200,,337,4.728813559322034
2443700,5,B000BWFWFK,"I loved the character Angel (David Boreanaz) when he appeared on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (I also own this series); but I did not realize how good an actor he was until his own series ""Angel"" started.  I have viewed this entire series three times and have never gotten tired of it.  The cast really clicks and they really did take some  of the great characters from Buffy like Charisma Carpenter, ""Wesley Wyndom Price"" (Alexis Denisof), and of course James Marsters.  The rest of the cast is also a complete fit with the Buffy alums.  The chemistry between the characters is great.  I even liked the original casting of Glen Quinn and it was so sad that he died.  I did notice that they did a dedication to him at the end of on of the shows.

It was in seeing the interviews with David Boreanaz that I realized that he is absolutely hillarious.  I had no idea.  This is an actor that can laugh at himself and have fun with it.  It shows as the series progresses and the team of him and Marsters was so good i think they could have done their own series.

I truly recommmend this series to anyone who wants a take on a vampire/detective genre.",1399939200,,1142,4.334905660377358
2443701,5,B000BWFWFK,"I enjoyed watching this series from the library, then from Netflix, now I have it and can watch whenever I want.",1398556800,,112,4.380952380952381
2443702,5,B000BWFWFK,It's great! We r waiting patiently for future shows to become available in the same manner. We love the show and what we got!,1397952000,,125,4.25
2443703,5,B000BWFWFK,Received on time and opened immediately. Was excited to finally being able to watch the whole series back to back. Didn't catch it when it was originally on TV.,1397865600,,160,4.551724137931035
2443704,5,B000BWFWFK,Always been a Buffy fan and now I feel complete with having the Angel series. They definitely go hand in hand when making appearances in each other shows. Package arrived on the day it was due and the money was well spent involving how fast my package arrived.,1397520000,,260,4.4375
2443705,5,B000BWFWFK,The same as with Buffy I didn't get the humor & thought it was dark & depressing now I love it!,1397433600,,95,3.5714285714285716
2443706,5,B000BWFWFK,"I got an offer from Amazon through my email mail for a ""Joss Whedon"" week. All of his stuff was ridiculously discounted and I got the entire angel series, buffy, firely, and serenity. It got here very quickly and was packaged well, no damage. As always, very impressed with Amazon!",1397347200,,281,4.64
2443707,5,B000BWFWFK,"Doesn't matter that I missed it when it was being aired. Now I can watch it whenever I want. Great fun!! Looking forward to a new episode every night without having to wait for the next week or put up with a ""re-run"" when I want to see the next ""new"" episode.
Really am enjoying the series which I didn't even know had been produced. Highly imaginative with action and well-developed characters.",1397088000,,395,4.5

2443709,5,B000BWFWFK,"I bought this for my vampire addiction. We watched it all in about 4 weekends. It was super fast shipping and I still have it!
Love it!",1396396800,,135,4.037037037037037

2443711,5,B000BWFWFK,"The box set is nice and the price is about $50 cheaper than buying the seasons individually. The box is a sleeve deal with the five seasons individually packaged by seasons in hard DVD jewel cases (one case per season), so if you don't like the box it comes in you can just throw it away and put the individual seasons on your shelf in their own cases. Good seller, good deal.",1395792000,,376,4.236111111111111
2443712,5,B000BWFWFK,This is an amazing series with amazing characters. The case for this is so sleek and beautiful I can't seem to look away from it. It is worth every penny. :),1395360000,,157,4.096774193548387

2443716,5,B000BWFWFK,"What can be said? I'm an Angel fan and a fan of David Boreanaz. I nice compact set to add to anyone's video library. The external box is what is pictured, a sturdy cardboard box. Inside the collection of the series in organized DVD's.
Worth the price.",1393200000,,251,4.361702127659575
2443717,5,B000BWFWFK,I love Buffy more but I am an Angel fan too. I love how the box sets are and looks. Keeps the cases of the discs extra protected. Love it!,1392336000,,138,3.6333333333333333
2443718,5,B000BWFWFK,"I personally have never seen the full series, I was always too busy to watch it when it was on.  I look forward to watching each episode.  The order arrived ahead of time and I was thankful, that I bought it when I did.",1391904000,,219,3.9545454545454546
2443719,5,B000BWFWFK,"The series itself is top-notch TV.  It takes characters from Buffy and allows them to evolve out of the shadow of Sunnydale's key residents and emerge as unexpected heroes, but it keeps the wit and top-tier writing that characterizes its sister show.  Some episodes stand amongst the best of the entire Buffyverse cannon.  A few examples: I will remember you in Season 1, a beautiful extension of Buffy & Angel's story of doomed love; Waiting in the Wings where Summer Glau was discovered as a future star; Apocalypse Now-ish, with maybe the best action scene in the entire Buffyverse; and of course SmileTime - Angel as a stuffed doll!

Although individual episode production values are usually high, the series itself takes a few episodes to find its footing, and doesn't really start to shine until Season 3, when it arguably surpasses Buffy itself in terms of plotting and sophistication.  The final two seasons are heart-wrenching, DVD-flipping, keep-you-up-at-night-watching-more.  The show probably ended a bit too soon, and many will find the series finale in season 5 a bit abrupt and will end up wanting more.  I did, and moved to the comics... although those never really left me fulfilled either.

This specific product is reasonable: the box is in a bit of a weird shape that isn't perfect for bookshelves, and there aren't any exciting goodies in the packaging itself so if you're into that sort of thing you'll be disappointed.  Personally I threw the box away and kept the 5 CD cases only.  DVDs contain all the extras, including interviews/etc, and the DVD navigation schemes are pretty straight-forward and user-friendly.",1391299200,6,1639,5.037037037037037
2443720,5,B000BWFWFK,I received this product in a timely manner and it was exactly what I expected to receive - a brand new set of discs with the entire Angel series on them.,1390176000,,153,3.967741935483871
2443721,5,B000BWFWFK,Got exactly what I wanted very quickly. Great buying experience and will definitely use again! This set is a must have for any Angel or Joss Whedon fan.,1389225600,,152,4.464285714285714
2443722,5,B000BWFWFK,I have always loved this series. I got my husband hooked on so I bought this series for him to watch and catch up on.,1388880000,,117,3.72
2443723,5,B000BWFWFK,As a fan of the Buffy series owning this series is a must. The spinoff Angel was great on its own. I look forward to watching them again and again over the years.,1388707200,,162,3.9393939393939394
2443724,5,B000BWFWFK,Loved this show...set the stage for all the great SyFy programs on today... The golden age of Buffy and Angel...what a run they had!,1388188800,,132,4.541666666666667
2443725,1,B000BWFWFK,"I've had to go out and buy the first season separately because the disk in this box were all scratched up. Thanks Amazon... as usual you really inspire confidence.

Good job!",1387584000,2,353,4.619047619047619
2443726,5,B000BWFWFK,All 5 seasons for LESS than $100! I really enjoyed the show but I did miss a couple seasons and didn't follow every single show. It's nice to catch up on and things make so much more sense now!,1385942400,,193,3.9743589743589745
2443727,5,B000BWFWFK,I'm a huge Buffy and Angel fan. I used to watch these shows when I was younger and I am so glad I bought the DVD set. Joss Whedon is a genius and this set is a must have for the Angel and Buffy fan.,1384992000,,198,3.422222222222222

2443730,5,B000BWFWFK,"I watched this series I borrowed from a friend.  I got totally engrossed in the series and couldn't stop watching!  During this timeframe I also got sick, so was in bed for a week, and watched it almost the entire time.  Not sure if I was really sick or just couldn't put it down!  When it came up on a deal page, I broke down and bought a copy for myself, so I can watch again.",1384041600,,378,3.9342105263157894
2443731,5,B000BWFWFK,"One of the best TV series from the past. Consider it an extension of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. The DVD,s are packed in a colorful box. Each DVD plays without error and provides a great picture.",1383868800,,204,4.394736842105263
2443732,4,B000BWFWFK,"I rated it lower because I had to return the first set of dvds because of skipping and scratches on the dvds.  Amazon promptly sent me another set, but unfortunately the last dvd of season 3 had a skip in it also.",1382400000,,213,4.071428571428571

2443736,5,B000BWFWFK,Awesome box set.  Show holds up well even after ten years plus.  Only things my set was missing was the numbering on the package and the letter from Whedon.,1380412800,,156,4.344827586206897
2443737,5,B000BWFWFK,this video set has not been watched completely thorough because there is so much..Very entertaining and the quality is as expected - no defects,1379980800,,143,5.0
2443738,4,B000BWFWFK,Awesome series. Only problem is the mix matched formats. All but the first season was wide screen. I would rather it be all full screen or all wide screen.,1379894400,,155,4.379310344827586
2443739,5,B000BWFWFK,"I'm so glad I bought this! I saw this the other day on sale for less than half the retail price so natrually I just had to get it. It was delivered really quickly and came in this beautiful case that really outlines the series magnificence. I would highly reccomend Angel or Buffy to anyone who is a fan of Boss Whedons work, especially since this is his 2nd best in my opinion ( the first being Buffy). Great for anyone who likes Buffy and is looking for the continuation of the Buffyverse story.",1379635200,,497,4.297872340425532
2443740,4,B000BWFWFK,"If you've a Buffy fan you definitely need to watch this series as well.

2443744,5,B000BWFWFK,"So I bought this for me and my gf to watch. I forgot so much about Angel, but watching these episodes brought back a lot of old memories. Used to watch this on TV and wait a week for the next episode. Watching back-to-back...awesome.

Only issue is that the packaging was all new, but there were some slight defects on the DVD cases it came with. Nothing major that affected the quality of the DVD's just cosmetic. Case is neat. Overall I recommend this to anyone who is a Fan of the Angel series. I've already lent the series to a buddy of mine.",1374019200,,546,4.25

DVD, particularly with the commentary, interviews and special features.",1369008000,,184,5.607142857142857
2443754,5,B000BWFWFK,"Yes, yes. I'm an Angel and 'Bones' fan-girl. Everything is/was as stated, came brand new & unscratched and came quickly in the mail. However, season 4's jewl case in my box-set was shattered even though it was in the center of the box and still in it's shrink wrap. I don't blame the vendor, but it makes watching season 4 a bit of a pain because the inside 'disk-flaps' fall out and it's hard overall to get that jewl case back into the box (as pictured.) Naturally, this is probably a one in 1 million case where an item is broken via shipment somewhere along the line, so you shouldn't base your purchase on my experience alone. The series is great, has some great funny & even hysterical moments, and is great entertainment overall. Any David Boreanaz fan would probably enjoy this series as a gift, and like me, grab any season on any given day and watch it. I'm not a 'Buffy' fan, I just fell in love with Angel while it was aired on Fox, and had to catch ALL the seasons for a good price!",1369008000,,995,4.297872340425532

It is a great series and follow up to Buffy the Vampire Slayer",1366502400,,130,3.5172413793103448
2443757,5,B000BWFWFK,It is wonderful to have the whole series as a boxed set!!!  I loved this show and watched it religiously when it was on tv.  Episodes now are rerun on DishTv at 2 or 3 am weekdays.  Saving them to the DVR with commercials just isn't the same as episodes one after another in sequence.  Thanks Amazon for the great price!,1365811200,,320,4.19672131147541
2443758,5,B000BWFWFK,ANYONE WHO LIKE BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER WILL LOVE THIS COLLECTION AND THIS SHOW ANGEL VAMP WITH A SOUL ROCKS,1365552000,,109,4.5
2443759,5,B000BWFWFK,"This series is absolutely incredible, one of my favorite series of all time; aside from Buffy of course. There's not one single episode that I do not like. I've watched the entire series in full four times now. I love the box, and the dvd cases are very cool.

I bought the box set for only $55.99; absolutely amazing price!! And what was very cool is that when I first went to purchase it on my prepaid walmart card, I didn't have enough on the card at the time. So I kept the box set in my cart until I was able to get the funds on my card, and within that time the price had went up. But I was still able to purchase it for the $55.99!!! I was very pleased with that!!

SPOILERS BELOW:

illyria was a huge surprise in season five, I cried when Fred died. But all in all I really enjoyed illyria; mostly because she helped the team and she, in a way, had feelings for Wesley. I really liked how Angel forgave Wesley for kidnapping Connor, and let him join the team again. Wesley was such a dork in Buffy, but transitioned into someone very dark in season four Angel.

2443765,5,B000BWFWFK,"I love the series and had wished that they would of renewed it. When the show was cancelled, WB had made a little ""Thank You"" video speech, thanking them for the 5 seasons of Angel. But There were fans who had petitions too save the show, and the ratings were good too continue.
But I heard it was like my overall favorite series, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" In that despite the high ratings, the show(s) were too expensive too produce.
But having followed the final season of the series into the world of graphic novels and comicbooks. Everyone from Wesley too Fred came back from the afterlife. I would of loved too of seen a continuation of their relationship, even though Fred had been turned into a demon, and was begining too understand her feelings for Wesley. Plus she was kicking Angels butt, lol.
I always thought with the success of ""The Avengers"" that maybe WB would be willing too resurrect the characters into a series of reunion movies, and tie up many of the loose ends. And what has happened too the characters. Did Angel finally become human in the end and marry Buffy? When he signed his soul away too Wolfram and Hart, was it his real name he was signing, Angel or Angeleus, ect? Things we will probly never know.

2443773,5,B000BWFWFK,I discovered Angel after I found Buffy since that is where he was first introduced. For those of you that have watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer and not Angel you might be interested to know that season one of Angel runs parallel to season four of Buffy. I tend to watch them in tandem beginning at that point. Angel actually clears of some of the events form some of the Buffy episodes like what happened to Faith! I love the fact that characters from Buffy (including Buffy) have popped up in some of the episodes along the way. My only criticism is season 5 which was a real let down at the end. I for one was really hoping that Angel and Buffy would wind up back together especially after the ending of Buffy season seven.

2443783,5,B000BWFWFK,"I stumbled on to Buffy and Angel rather late.  I started watching the shows in what was the 5th Season for Buffy and the 2nd season of Angel.  Obviously I have seen every episode since both shows were put out on DVD, but I remember becoming an instant fan of both shows, especially Angel, even without all the back-story.  The overall theme of Angel was always the fight against evil, and how it never ends.  The themes on Angel tended to be more mature than those on Buffy, especially as compared to the first three seasons of Buffy.  It did really well in fleshing out his back-story and the transition from Angelus to the good guy he would ultimately become.

The thing I loved that they were able to do on Angel, that was the whole storyline about the redemption of Faith that started in season 1 and carried over to season 4.  The whole story was well written, well acted, and was probably not something that could have ever been done effectively on Buffy.  The show also did well at making all the characters evolve, especially Cordelia and Wesley.  At least not as effectively as it was on Angel.  The last season seems to be one that many fans either liked or hated.  I loved the last season.  The whole story of trying to fight evil from inside the belly of the beast was done well.  And it had some of the best episodes of the series, including Hellbound, Smile Time, A Hole in The World, and Shells.

The ending to the series was rushed, mainly because the network cancelled the show pretty much at the last minute.  They actually had to go back and re-shoot some of the scenes for the last show after they knew it was going to be a series finale rather than the season finale. While not quite a Sapranos fade abrupt black screen, the series is not wrapped up in a nice tidy bow.  It cuts off at the start of an epic battle, the conclusion to which we never know (unless you get the season 6 comic books).

Chances are if you are reading this you already know at least a little bit about the series.  While liking or disliking a TV show involves a large amount of subjectivity, what I can tell you is that if you have seen some of the shows and liked those, the series on the whole is consistently good with not many bad or ""clunker"" episodes among the 110 episodes.",1343433600,,2277,4.330188679245283

It's not as good overall as Buffy (which is one of the best shows in the history of television) but it reaches the same heights through certain arcs and is definitely worth buying.

2443789,5,B000BWFWFK,"This Collector's Box of all 5 Seasons of Angel will look great on any fan's shelf. When I opened up the box it made me feel a little giddy just seeing how organized the aesthetics are. David Boreanaz's face comes together when each season's book-like case is stacked upon each other. You also get a letter from Joss Whedon and a complete listing of Episodes booklet, just in case you get lost.
And I mean, you could very well get lost at some point.

Everything in the box looks great. However, once you reach the menus on the DVDs it's important to remember how to read English. ""Left to right. Top to bottom."" The disc menus are a little unorganized and inconsistent, though appealing, and every now and then, say in the middle of a season, there's a ""Special Features"" which covers the entire season. I would rather have this at the end of the season or on a completely separate disc, but knowing that this is DVD and not blu-ray, I can forgive them as they have to fit everything into 6 discs per season.
You also do NOT have the option to ""Play All"". Each episode will have its own menu where to click ""Play"". I'm sorry you can't be lazy with this one.

With these minor disappointments, mostly when the last episode ran to credits and I realized the story was over, I give this set 5 pints of pig's blood.",1330214400,,1311,4.368852459016393

The dvd's look great too and the only thing better would be a blu ray release.

2443799,5,B000BWFWFK,"I started watching Angel in FOX channel almost by chance, because I watched Buffy and then, when the character of David Boreanaz leaves Sunnydale in the end of the third season of Buffy I naturally followed him. And I fell in love with one of the best shows ever made for TV. The angle of Redemption, the vampire with a soul that struggles with his own personal (and literally real) demon to overcome his past transgressions and to become a better ""person"" (in the lack of a better word!) is a metaphor of the human condition in all times. The famous gypsy curse that unsouls Angel if he experiences one single moment of perfect happiness is the most cunning artifice that an experienced scriptwriter could invent to compose a character full of angst,guilt and perplexity. Angel does not make his own choices, he deals with the cards that Fate or The Powers that Be give to him. Buffy is young, human, has a whole life to live besides being the Slayer and she can find happiness and still save the world in daily basis. Angel is cursed in knowing that whatever he does from now on will NEVER erase his past, his crimes are almost without forgiveness. So he saves people out of desperation, feeling that even the best that he does is not good enough because he is still a VAMPIRE, a predator, a beast that must remain contained to not kill or maim another human. The complexity of the character, the other actors that suffered also transformations walking through paths almost from Hell makes Angel one of the most unforgettable TV shows of all times. You never becomes tired of watching Angel. The human condition with all its flaws is the plot of the TV show and the Vampire with a Soul/Champion of the Helpless is the mirror that every person that seeks redemption from past mistakes must contemplate. If you never watched this show, please do. If you have watched and forgotten, please watch again. You will find nuances and subplots that will astonish you. Congratulations Joss Whedon, in Angel you created a veritable Immortal!",1316044800,,2032,4.67877094972067

All in all this show finds a way to keep making you come back. They never skip a beat and every episode is made to bring you back for the next one. They always end with an ""OH MY GOSH!!! WHAT!!!!"" expression just before the ending credits, so you know you just HAVE to watch the next episode. Grr! They are so great at that.

Definitely this show gets all my highest praise. That and the character of Angel is so sexy!...no homo :P

This set goes through all of the trials and tribulations of five years of Angel in Los Angeles. After tragically ending his relationship with Buffy in the Season 3 fiasco, Angel goes to live in Los Angeles, fighting as a mysterious protectorate of the human race. He is met by a strange, comic, half-demon named Doyle who gets visions of people in trouble. With Doyle and Sunnydale-transplant Cordelia, they form Angel Investigations, a supernatural detective agency bent on helping the helpless, for a small fee of course. They fight everything from vampires to lawyers to demons to all-powerful evils and all the slimy hell-beasts in between. Along the way, there are several crossovers from Buffy, such as run-ins with Spike, Oz, Faith, and the addition of Wesley, along with new characters, that form Angel's unique and entertaining team of demon-fighters that make Angel an unmistakably crucial part of the Buffy/vampire TV universe.

This 30-disc DVD set is a must-have for any true fan of the Buffyverse. I was thrilled to get an astounding deal on it for $51 as a Deal of the Day. It contains all five epic seasons of Angel, our favorite vampire-with-a-soul, in a trendy collector's box with the individual sets forming Angel's face with the cast underneath. The set also contains a witty letter from Joss Whedon as well as a booklet with color synopses of all the episodes, the perfect matching companion to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Chosen Collection.",1297900800,,1616,4.915750915750916
2443814,1,B000BWFWFK,"I love this show, but I cannot overlook the terrible quality control that went into producing this box set.  I went through two different box sets before I found one that had no defects (at least, none that I'm aware of yet).  20th Century Fox was absolutely no help in resolving my issues with mislabeled discs.  HELLO!? Fox produced this box set, they are ultimately responsible for manufacturer defects in the discs!  When you order this box set, you better make sure that all the discs will play correctly and that they contain the labeled content.  By the way, you only have the 30-day return policy in which to accomplish this.  Yes, that's right, you're expected to view all 30 discs worth of material within a month, otherwise you are out of return policy if you discover any issues later.",1297814400,7,797,4.6571428571428575

On several occasions right before Christmas I actually had to stop her from buying seperate seasons without letting her know I was getting this. I couldn't find it anywhere but Amazon. This is a beautiful box set with a TERRIFIC PRICE. Yes it is essentially the original seperate seasons packaged in a pretty outer box, but that is basically all I was looking for. If I had to think of something lacking, it is that it would have been nice to have an additional disc of bonus features.",1296950400,,564,4.53921568627451

2443818,3,B000BWFWFK,"I bought this quite recently, although not from Amazon, and have since gone through all of the DVDs. I like to watch DVDs on my computer, and I came across a problem with one in season 5. My computer tells me ""This disc is not formatted to play in this region."" Now, I understand WMP has some problems with errors popping up about the region of the DVD, but I have selected it to play DVDs from Region 1, as it should be, and it just does not work. So what's up with that? I took a good look at my DVDs. I noticed, within season 5 at least, half of the discs are copyrighted 2004, and half of them are copyrighted 2008. It looks to me like they have mixed new DVDs with old ones. As a result, it also appears as though they may have mixed up the regions, considering one of them won't even work. Another issue I have: quite a few of my discs have minor scratches on them. Not too much to worry about since it appears as though all the other discs work fine, but I do not expect any scratches at all on a set of never-opened DVDs.
It is hard for me to give a low rating on this set, because the content itself is amazing. Angel was a great show, and it is one that I have watched over and over again dozens of times and I am still not sick of it. However, it bothers me that the Series has been re-released as brand new in 2010, and I have 6-year-old DVDs in my set, including one DVD that won't even play at all.

Let me restate: this review is not specifically about the show. This is my second-favorite show of all time next to Buffy, and I would give the series 5/5 stars. The characters are great, the plots are great, the dialogue is great. My rating of 3 stars is for the poor repackaging of the box set. I have since taken the set back to get a replacement. All the disks work in my new set, but they still appear to be a compilation of different years and there are still minor scratches on a few of the disks. Luckily, the scratches in this box have not caused playback issues, but it is still frustrating to see when someone thinks they are buying something new.",1292284800,27,2072,4.078431372549019

Look at the TV shows about vampires nowadays,, True Blood, Vampire Diaries..etc.. They don't even start to compare with Angel. David's character fills the pants of a vampire with a soul that is filled with guilt and a mission of redemption in addition to his lost love to Buffy.

But late night tv watching, and missing episodes here and there kicking myself because I wanted to see more I slowly fell in love with the Angel-verse as well. Lorne is my utmost fave! (RIP Andy!)

Learning that some of the shows actually tie in with the Episodes of Buffy as well, made it kind of cool to see what went on 'behind the scenes' so to speak when Buffy would leave to see Angel ect. It really does complete the entire series that Joss Whedon created by having both this Box Set and the Buffy one.

Anyway, I am not much of a tv watcher but every so often when I did turn on the tube I would catch an episode or two of Angel and when this box set came out I had to have it.  Not at all disappointed, because I got an opportunity to see the show from the beginning and how each character grew and changed over the 5 years the show was on the air.

What is great is that this box set comes with a booklet listing each episode along with a bit of information as to what the episode is about.  Many of the episodes on the dvds have commentary from those involved from the actor(s),director, and or creator about what was happening either prior to or during the process of filming the episode.  That is a nice added bonus to only watching it on the tube when a network airs it, because you get a more complete sense of what those involved with the show were trying to convey to us.

First and foremost this series was a great ride, which I thought too juvenile to watch in real time.  About 2-years ago I got a really good deal on this collectors set and it promptly sat on my shelf for nearly 2-years.  As a result of the good ratings, the track record of Joss Whedon and the recent hiatus in the schedule, I broke the seal on the set and started watching.  Season 1 started somewhat slowly (as is the MO for Joss Whedon series), though seasons 2-4 caused several nights of limited sleep, as almost every show ended with a cliff hanger and I told myself that I would simply watch 5-minutes of the next episode and the next thing I knew is was 4:30 AM!  Season 5 simply felt different where perhaps it was the removal of the cliff hanger concept.  Perhaps it was the disappearance of Charisma Carpenter from the show, as aside from cut off tight shirts, she seemed to have some of the better lines and her delivery was so non chalant that some of the verbal entendres were easy to miss.  Frankly, I feel that the series ended at the perfect time and it may have been a stretch to milk a 6th season.",1264982400,,1166,4.296803652968037

Some technical things: the case is great. between roommates, friends and myself probably every disc has been watched 3 times, and the box remains in excellent conditions. It's very space efficient for five seasons. None of the DVDs have ever skipped or given me any problems.

Spoilers ahead.

With respect to Angel the series... what great stuff. It was a bit slow in season 1, but by the start of season 2 I ""needed"" to watch the series, to see what would happen to the characters. The Angel-Darla romance is imo the most beautiful romantic story arc in the Buffyverse. It was fascinating to see how she changed as she went from human to vampire back to human and to vampire again, and then finally a vampire gestating a hybrid baby who has a soul. Also great: Angel going dark in season 2 without actually being Angelus; the GUNN character and the exploration of human society's underworld, and how they know more about vampires; the alternate reality kingdom that Lorne is from; and finally the gang taking over Wolfram and Hart in season 5.

I'm not sure how this series compares to Buffy. As a package I'd rate Buffy higher, they both have great episodes, Angel had fewer bad episodes ... Buffy may have benefited from having more characters and being more original.",1264550400,,1327,4.686695278969957

Tough to watch and be at work on time, so I had to order the entire set.  Not only was the timeframe a bad choice for me, I had started watching midseason of the second season and it was making me crazy not knowing the entire story line from the beginning.  I'm not typically one to watch things over and over, but these will definitely be worn out eventually.  I'm also not one who normally enjoys sci-fi/fantasy type shows, but I was immediately intrigued with Angel, the main character.  Each episode is really well put together and tied in with previous epidodes, making you want to know the whole story!  The subtle humor and irony is well placed. Because I have worked in the legal field for 25+ yrs, the added bonus of a major lawfirm being a focal point in the plot was a bonus for me.  Strangely enough, I found the characters to be believable, which is tough for me in sci-fi/fantasy world.

I had the first three seasons individually, but I knew when I saw the box collector's set come out that I HAD to have it. And I am so glad that I bought it!

Then, the DVDs in each season were encased in a separate ""booklet"", which can be stacked up with the ""backs"" forming a picture of David Boreanaz, who plays Angel.

2443870,4,B000BWFWFK,"The naysayers and detractors will say that 'Angel' was simply riding on the coattails of the popular (and critically acclaimed) BtVS. Like its predecessors 'Melrose Place' (spin-off of 'Beverly Hills 90210') and even further back, 'The Jeffersons' (spun-off of 'All in the Family'), the brilliant Joss Whedon managed to craft a more mature product right from the get-go when 'Angel' premiered on the WB in the Fall of 1999. This was grittier, rawer and edgier than BtVS showed in its infancy. From its inception, 'Angel' explored the dark forces of the main characters' psyches and pushed the envelope with the ""monster-of-the-week"" format.

The show wasn't without its hitches. I can remember DESPISING Elisabeth Rohm's character of Det. Kate Lockley from the very beginning (she comes from the Jennifer Aniston school of acting-1 note emoting, and its flat). The late Glenn Quinn's character of Francis Doyle-while somewhat charming-didn't mesh quite right with David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter. The season 4 storyline of Angel's teenage son Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) and Cordelia was ICKY beyond belief (so upset Joss took it there), and their hell-spawn Jasmine was a waste of time (and Geena Torres' talent).

Luckily the hits were much greater. Boreanaz cements his status as one of TV's greatest vampires ever, while Charisma Carpenter's Cordelia Chase was so much more developed and layered than her short 3 seasons on BtVS. Loved, loved, loved (!) Alexis Denisof as Wesley Wyndham-Price, J. August Richards (now tearing it up on TNT's 'Raising the Bar') as Charles Gunn, the late Andy Hallett (RIP) as the singing Host, Lorne and the fantastic Amy Acker as Winifred ""Fred"" Burkle (also the demon-goddess Ilyria).

I can't state how disappointing the brass at the defunct WB made me when they canceled 'Angel.' Only getting to see James Marsters (Spike) in approximately 20 episodes was not enough! Payback is a ""you all know"" though; there's a reason the WB is now known as the defunct WB.

2443872,1,B000BWFWFK,"Two Months after buying this set I discovered a defective disc for Season 4. One of the episodes skipped. Too much time had passed for Amazon to replace it, so instead, they refunded me $25 to put towards the purchase of Season 4 independently. They didn't even ask if that was OK. They just did it. Why would they think that was reasonable? I had the individual Seasons, but I wanted the Collectors Set to replace them.

Instead of getting into an argument with Amazon, I contacted the FoxStore to see If they could send me a replacement disc. They told me that they don't replace single discs, and that I would have to send them the entire product. I dished out the money for shipping and sent it to Fox. It took almost 9 weeks to get my replacement set.

This new set has several scratched discs, the plastic cases that hold DVD's are cracked for Season 5, and Season 4: Disc 3 is actually Season 1: Disc 3. The label reads that it is Season 4: Disc 3, but the episodes and extras on the disc are from Season 1: Disc 3.

I have contacted Fox and will surely have to return the set once again. looks like I'm out the product I payed for in February for another 2+ Months.

It's my favorite and I watch it over and over!! I hated killing off Cordelia, but her character was a little compromised after the whole pregnant-with-Connor's-evil-child saga. I didn't like that, but I did like Connor's character and Cordy's visions.

What sucks is that you could tell David Boreanaz was getting out of shape, and thus looking older. He was making Angel less seductive (thought he's always been hot) because he started to look older. But it's been a few years, and as soon as Bones started up, he looked almost exactly like his cameo on Buffy! Makes me sad.

2443883,5,B000BWFWFK,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan. He's the guy behind Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, and Dollhouse. I've seen every episode of every show he's ever produced, and I'm slowly moving towards reading some of the stuff he has written.

The thing I appreciate about his shows/movies is that they don't treat the viewer like an intellectual child. There are always subtleties to be found that make the show rich. Also, unlike some popular sci-fi/fantasy shows out there, the questions that arise during the season are always wrapped up well. You aren't left with huge cliff-hangers that leave you wanting to smash your head into walls. There is certainly some mystery to be found, but it is all carefully crafted to give you a complex big picture that is going to be intellectually pleasing.

I bought this series because I'd followed the show loosely when it originally aired, and because it was a Gold Box offer the price was unbelievably good. Watching and re-watching episodes has been a real treat as I've followed the improbable and (Whedon admits it himself) cheesy idea of a ""vampire with a soul"". We follow the (un)life of Angel as he tries to fulfill his role of Champion and attempt to repent for the sins of his past. The supporting roles that come in over time are well crafted and lead to some quite believable tension/humor points as they grow together. My personal favorite supporting character is Wes who was originally introduced on Buffy and followed Angel over when he broke off from the Buffy series. You can follow his steady progression from college educated goof-ball to smooth and suave agent of good. This general progression seems to follow all of the characters and by season 5 they are a well-oiled fighting machine. You can tell they actors have great chemistry and it shows on screen. The largest drawback that some people (not I) might find is that this show does get very soap opera-esque as the seasons progress. The thing that pulls this out of the ""overly-dramatic-oh-no!"" hole is the fact that you are still watching green and blue demons get blown apart. In an ironic way, the fantasy element helps keep it grounded and not too heavy.

As for the actual boxed set, I couldn't have been happier. It comes in a very low-form package and takes up very little space. Everything is attractively packed and the DVD's are in sturdy plastic holders that are durable. The only thing you should know is that the entire height of the box is considerably less than that of a regular DVD case so it won't look extremely uniform on a shelf with other DVDs.

Summary: Whedon's shows are guaranteed to keep your engaged and leave you satisfied. Angel is an extremely well thought out fantasy soap opera mixing lots of great laughs with some rather dark themes. The DVD box set is durable, attractive and well worth the money, especially if you liked Whedon's other things.",1243814400,3,2922,4.746062992125984
2443884,5,B000BWFWFK,"I love all of the Angel episodes.  Prior to purchasing this collector set, I had purchased seasons 1 - 5 separately.

I was trying to locate the special features on the collector set and had to go on the internet via the Barnes & Noble website to find out where they were on the collector set.

2443920,5,B000BWFWFK,"By far Angel might be the best spinoff TV show ever, at least as far as Sci-Fi or Drama shows are concerned. Angel starts out right after Season 3 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And it runs on the same time line as Seasons 4,5,6 & 7 of Buffy, with Season 5 of Angel coming after the conclusion of Buffy's last season.

Angel is a darker more adult version of Buffy. Over the course of the show the charachters grow and change, and all of it feels natural. The charachters evolve as you would expect them to with the situations they go through. One of the great things about Joss Whedon shows is even the supporting charachters are well thought out.

Season 1, takes a little time to get on it's feat, but finishes very strong.

Season 2 & 3 might be the best seasons in television history. Granted, you appreciate them much more had you been a Buffy fan and are familiar with the lore. It cannot be stated enough, these are amazing seasons.

Season 4, was different. A lot of people will point to this is the beginning of the end for the show. It has a lot of good things about it, but you could tell that off screen things affected this season. (This was the year Joss Whedon went off to do Firefly, and helped more with the last season of Buffy, so it has always been my opinion that Angel didn't get enough of his attention.)

Season 5 was a GREAT way to end the show. It has some of the best individual episodes of the entire series. ""Thank You"" will have you in tears. And the final episode of the series has you crying because it's over and you want it to keep going.

If you appreciate good story telling and great charachters. Whether you are a fan of Science Fiction/Fantasy, you owe it to yourself to watch Angel in it's entirety!",1231718400,,1738,4.283536585365853
2443921,5,B000BWFWFK,"Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is one of the best shows ever written for television, but this spin off featuring Buffy's first love, Angel, is even more consistantly entertaining than its parent show. Co-created by Whedon and David Greenwalt, ""Angel"" features the adventures of Angel (David Boreanaz), the vampire cursed with a soul as he roams Los Angeles, battling demons and helping the helpless in hopes of finding redemption for his past crimes. Joining him is Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), one of Buffy's classmates who has moved to L.A, along with half-demon Doyle (Glenn Quinn). Over the course of the series, Angel and Cordelia are joined by a cast of great characters, including Buffy and Faith's ex-watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), vampire hunter Gunn (J. August Richards), the cute and brainy Fred Burkle (Amy Acker), and kareoke singing demon Lorne (Andy Hallet). The show gets better and better with each passing season (whereas Buffy sore of jumped around in quality after season 3), with the final season being by far my favorite season of any show ever. If you enjoy dark, sprawling epics, interesting characters and writing that will actually make you think, I cannot reccomend Angel (as well as ""Buffy"") enough. I also reccomend picking up the ""Angel: After the Fall"" comics, which is the official continuation of Angel's story written by Whedon and author Brian Lynch.",1231632000,,1405,5.166666666666667

2443925,5,B000BWFWFK,"I never watched much of Angel when it was on the air.  I didn't watch Buffy either, but I had always wanted to watch both based on the reviews and word of mouth.  I saw just enough to tantalize but I always was reticent about diving into something half way through.
So earlier this year I bought the entire Buffy series on DVD and watched it in about two months, from start to finish.  It went beyond my expectations with the great writing, intriguing stories, and interesting characters.  So after finishing it I ended up getting Angel, to see where his story led to after he left Sunnydale.
Though both series were different I appreciated how they tied together for the four years they were on at the same time.

Buffy always had a more specific path to follow whereas Angel is much more meandering, with no real ""Big Bad"" that haunts him throughout an entire season.  We get to see Angel and the supporting cast all shift, change, transform, and mature in so many different ways throughout the series, making it easy for me to attach to them and enjoy them both at their best and worst.
People have told me that Angel was darker than Buffy.  For me, it was more that he did not have a specific path to follow.  ""We help the helpless"" was the mantra for a long time but even with that it gets a little hazy in Angel's world as to what is supposed to happen.  For Buffy, it was always clearer.  At least the big picture.

Both series have so much to offer for fans that it would be hard for me to say which I liked better.  Most of the folks who would think to pick up either series on DVD probably already have their minds made up and were previous fans.  So I consider myself lucky that I was able to cough up the dough for both series and was able to watch them both, for the first time, episode to episode, back to back.",1227312000,,1825,4.255072463768116

I am waiting now for a super sale to buy the Buffy series.  Whedon makes some good shows that my wife finds entertaining as well (which is rare).  Buy it you'll like it.",1221609600,,460,4.2298850574712645
2443930,4,B000BWFWFK,"All in all, good stuff, and pretty much what I have come to expect out of the mean, mean, very mean, Fred-killing, Joss Whedon.

I very much appreciated the respect that Angel pays its audience.  The show doesn't feel the need to explain everything to viewers that might jump into the story midstream.  It treats the audience as adults.  Either they take the time to view the series, or they accept that they are entering into a story in the middle.  I was glad to see them abandon the encapsulated episodes of the first season, and move on to larger story arcs.

Angel doesn't exactly hit on all of the comedy cylinders, in the way that the Buffy or Firefly stuff does.  The situational and character humor (Mandy, etc.) are right there, but the one-liners feel a little bit forced on occasion.  It is more focused on the dramatic arcs; so this isn't too large of a drawback.  Anyway there often is not a lot to laugh about in Angel.

Angel:  Boreanaz turns in a really solid performance through out the show.  Angel was a well defined character coming from Buffy.  I was glad to see that they were able move on from simply brooding over Buffy.  Brooding over himself provides plenty of fertile ground.

Doyle:  Was fun while he lasted.  Joss doesn't mind breaking conventions.  One of the things that I love about Joss Whedon-verse is that he seldom strings the viewers along in a 90210-esque unrequited love farce.  Sure, as soon as you get together one of you will probably drop dead, lose your soul, be consumed from the inside by an ancient demon, etc., but at least he doesn't leave the viewers screaming JAHOYFT, for very long.  This way of treating the audience as adults is exemplified (as is one of my myriad reasons for utterly loving Fred) when Gunn breaks up with Fred, in The House Always Wins.  Fred doesn't flounder.  She isn't hurt, or self doubting, or angry.  She immediately goes to her friends and tells them that Gunn is in terrible danger.  Yeah, my girl is smart and empathetic.

The visions, together with Caritas, also provide great mechanisms for the exposition of flobotnam.  It saves so much screen time just to be able to plant these things, and in the case of Caritas, provides great laughs.

Cordellia:  Cordy has a wonderful arc from Buffy to You're Welcome.  She really does become a higher power, the All Mother, serene, grounded, strong, and wise.  Who'd've thunk.

Wesley:  Wesley is wonderful throughout.  Great dark turns, while staying true to his heart, his conscience, and his friends.  Alexis (and the script) takes a character that started as nothing more than a comic foil, builds him into a truly heroic character.  Again Joss doesn't fall into clichd unrequited love.  Wesley will always love Fred, (and who wouldn't?) but he doesn't keep it a secret, nor does he hold it against Gunn that he also loves her, or that she doesn't return his love.

Gunn:  Gunn is a tricky one for me to sum up.  In the beginning I liked Gunn quite a bit.  His persona as an independent white-hat was compelling, and his initial position as one of Angel's Avengers was a great fit.  I was glad to have someone to identify with while loving Fred, but it is during their relationship that his role starts to weaken.  I can't quite put my finger on what weakens.  It is something about him getting caught up in thinking of himself as ""just the muscle,"" but that isn't quite it.  Gunn was always more than just the muscle.  So, his falling so easily into this trap is part of it.  That said, I like the Brain Upgrade story line, I just don't see the muscle motivation as being enough.  His performance suffers somewhat, but becomes strong again, by the end and his final deal with Wolfram & Hart.

Kate:  It is too bad that Kate's story sort of fell apart.  I would have liked to have seen this story fleshed out more, or at lease given a better send off.

Loren:  A wonderful addition to the cast, Loren is comedy gold.  Any time they need to lighten the atmosphere, they can just have someone sing.  Loren also adds to the dramatic story lines by contrasting the Champions with his own cowardly, if good hearted motivations.

""And stop calling me pastries.""

Spike:  Spike is always great.  I was very pleased to see him join the show.  His contrast with Angel (old world vs. new world, emotionally sequestered vs. heart on the sleeve of his leather coat) creates great comic tension.

Harmony:  Mercedes takes the shallowest of characters and gets us to care about her, a trend that began on Buffy, but continues to deepen throughout Angel, mirroring Cordy's path but toward evil instead of good, and in a shallower and shallower, if innocuous manner.

Wolf, Ram, & Hart:  They got me.  Very cool villains.  Yeah, it took a lot to accept that our heroes were willing to dive into the belly of the beast, but it made for a compelling ride.  The reveals that they were among the most ancient of evils, and that they existed in Pilea as well gave them great character.

Lindsey:  Lindsey is a great villain.  He is smart and his motivations are plausibly his own, rather than a monolithic representation of Wolfram & Hart.  Strangeloveian demon hand, tattoos, and triple crosses, coupled with the possibility of redemption make for an excellent villain.

Lila: Lila pales somewhat beside Lindsey.  She performs a necessary function, and does it well, but I would have liked to see her ride that middle ground of pretending to be willing to seek redemption while holding up a faade (that is in fact real) of evil, and dancing close to the fire of caring for Wesley.

Eve:  I couldn't stand Eve as, I am sure, the audience is not supposed to be able to.  Well done.

Conner:  Well, Conner was fine as a baby.  And he was fine as normal kid.  Let's just leave it at that.  (Holts was good plot line, though)

Andrew:  It was wonderful to see Andrew again, and the character that he grew into, not entirely leaving his old self behind, but having come so far as to be a new person.

And lastly, but certainly not leastly, Fred:  What can I say about Fred?  Whatever I say it couldn't possibly be enough.  I was simply head over heels in love with Fred before she even left the cave.  I've been looking for a girl like Fred for my whole life.  It isn't just Amy Acker.  Amy is beautiful and all, but Fred is so much more than beautiful; sweet, and kind, and self reliant, ingenious, even tempered, and cute when she is annoyed, forthright, clever, witty, driven to learn, and then there is her lyrical vibrant voice.  Does anyone know where I can find Fred?  I'm sure she must be looking for me too.  If you see her, please have her drop me a line.  I am missing her terribly.

And okay, really lastly Ilyria:  A tip of the hat these wonderful producers for giving us Ilyeria and softening the blow of Fred.  I was so prepared to despise Ilyria, but being Joss Whedon's emotional marionette, he was once again able to twist my heartstrings into caring about her.  It was beautiful to watch her learn to be human, and fall from grace.  (Can you say ""fall from grace"" about a creature that graceful?)",1221436800,2,7118,4.550197628458498

I'd have to admit- on TNT every morning central time, from 5 am to 7 am they do reruns of Angel and I watch it everyday.  I haven't bought this series yet but plan too because it's a must have.  What broke my heart is that today the episode of Doyles death was on and for the life of me I had to watch it again.  So I found it on YouTube and you know something- I didn't know that Glen who played Doyle died in real life- I didn't know he died from an heroin overdose.  It's sad because his character, Doyle- he seemed like an average regular joe and I just loved him because of the way he'd look at Cordelia and she never caught on to him being that infatuated with her almost until it was too late, when he kissed her.  I find it so kind of him to give her that gift, his gift- the visions, he found her worthy to have it and to him it meant something.  I guess that means Doyle did love Cordelia very much- the courage and strength he had to end his life for others, including his love.  That's very romantic and very sad.

Angel, IMO, won't ever quite measure up to the quality of BtVS, but it's still a terrific series, with strong moments and relative consistency throughout. There are parts of Season 4 and Season 5 that are disappointing, but the show as a whole did well.

As for the collection, the production values are excellent, the modularized box is terrific (small amount of shelf space required), and the extras (mostly cast commentary and featurettes) are worthwhile.

2443943,4,B000BWFWFK,"This spin-off of Buffy The Vampire Slayer in my opinion is far superior than it's predecessor.  They took what was best about Buffy (namely David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter) and made a darker, more adult show with it.  Angel is to Buffy what Melrose Place was to 90210, in the sense that the story lines are more mature.  The richness of the characters and the chemistry that the actors have on screen is what makes this show so wonderful.  It also doesn't hurt that Joss and his crack team of writers are witty and know how to throw a curve-ball at you better than any pitcher in Major League Baseball.  David Boreanaz is amazing, he brings a vulnerability to Angel that I think a lot of actors would have a hard time finding within themselves.  Then as Angelus, he is cruel, callous and deliciously evil.  His ability to portray these two sides of Angel with such conviction is what makes him one of my favorite actors on TV.  As for the DVD set, it's great.  The design is sleek and compact, there is a booklet that contains a mini-guide to each episode, each season is packed separately in a booklet style sleeve and there is a letter from Joss included as well.  The extras are great, we get some behind the scenes looks at what it takes to create a great series like Angel.

2443946,5,B000BWFWFK,"ANGEL was that rarest of shows, a spin-off on equal footing with its parent, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. In the first season of BUFFY, Angel was introduced to us as a notoriously sadistic vampire (Angelus) who fell afoul of a gypsy clan in 1898 and was cursed with  restoration of his human soul. Still a vampire, but now tormented by his human conscience, Angel (David Boreanaz) wandered aimlessly for 100 years before he met and fell in love with Buffy, and decided it was possible for him to achieve redemption by fighting the forces of evil. Three years later, he got his own show.

ANGEL was markedly different in tone than BUFFY - like the main character, ably played by David Boreanaz, the show was dark and brooding, and got a great deal of mileage out of tormenting its protagonist and his sidekicks both mentally, physically and emotionally. A champion for the forces of good, Angel is not only brutal in his methods but overflowing with doubts about whether personal redemption is possible or the war against evil anything but a fool's errand. His friendships with with BUFFY alums Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) and Wesley Wyndham-Price (Alexis Denisoff), Francis Doyle (the late great Glenn Quinn), Charles Gunn (J. August Richards), Fred (Amy Acker) and Lorne (Andy Hallett) provide him with some stability, but Angel is nearly as hard on those he loves as those he hates, and those looking for stainless heroes who never lose should look elsewhere.

Series Overview:

Season 1: This is a very good inaugural effort, showing Angel's arrival in L.A. and his formation of Angel Investigations with Doyle and Cordelia (and later, Wesley and Gunn). It explores much of Angel's 18th century backstory and has guest appearances by numerous BUFFY cast members. It also introduces the principal villain of the series, the demonic law firm of Wolfram & Hart. The season is undermined somewhat by the unfortunate departure of the excellent Doyle character and by some problems establishing its own identity, but it's still good. *** 

Season 2: An excellent effort which centers around W & H's attempt to drive Angel to the dark side by resurrecting his vampiric sire and lover of 150 years, Darla (another BUFFY alum). As Angel grows darker and darker, his friends are forced to continue the fight against evil without him, and tension rises as collateral damage piles up everywhere. This season introduces two new characters, Lorne, an empathic demon who reads peoples futures by hearing them sing (hilarious) and Fred, a nerdily charming genius who becomes grist for a future love triangle between Wes and Gunn. We also get to see goddess-hot Charisma Carpeter in a metal bikini. **** 

Season 3: One of the more brutal seasons. Angel's dalliance with Darla produces a resentful supernatural offspring named Connor (Vincent Kartheiser), whose arrival gives an old enemy, Holtz, an opportunity to pay Angel back in kind for slaughtering his family in the 1700s. Conned into betraying Angel, Wesley is ostracized by the gang and wavers between good and evil. To top it all off, Cordelia and Angel begin to explore their feelings for each other, only to be forced apart by two very separate sets of circumstances. ****

Season 4: This was at once the best and theworst of ANGEL. The first three-quarters of the shows were superb and featured a seemingly indestructable foe and ever-increasing tension as the screws were turned on each character: Cordelia returns from the netherworld with no memory and a hidden agenda; the relationship between Gunn and Fred crumbles; Connor descends into madness; Wesley flirts more and more with villainy; Angelus returns to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, the season falls apart almost completely when Charisma Carpenter's character is written out of the show and the ultimate villain finally introduced. *** 1/2

Season 5: A work of genius from beginning to end, my only beef with it is that it's so good it leaves you starving for the more that was supposed to come: in a shocking move, Angel & Company are invited to take over Wolfram & Hart, where they hope to ""change the system from the inside"" and pay a corresponding price as the seduction of power overtakes them. J. August Richards does his best work when his character is given an ""upgrade"" he can't bear to relinquish, and Amy Acker and Alexis Denisoff should have gotten Emmys for their heartrending performance as doomed lovers. Finally, the addition of BUFFY alum Spike (James Marsters) to the cast was a masterstroke that does the impossible, actually compensating for the loss of Charisma Carpenter. But even she gets a touching goodbye in ""You're Welcome"", an outstanding episode in an outstanding season.*****

That's ANGEL. If you're already a fan, five seasons for the price of three ain't a bad deal, and if you aren't, I guarantee this is money well spent.",1210032000,2,4869,4.976629766297663
2443947,5,B000BWFWFK,"I was thrilled when this series appeared on the Amazon Gold Box Deals and was able to purchase it for less than $60. I grew up with Buffy the Vampire  Slayer, and always thought David Boreanaz was one of the most phenomenal actors on television. When he got his own spin off, I was even more excited. If you want to learn more about the world of demons, vampires, love, sex, but from the other side of things, from the view of a Vampire with a soul, this is the show for you. A great companion piece to Buffy. The entire series has very spot on humor, but is generally darker than Buffy. It still has the wit and charm as the Buffy series, but has its own characters too. Buffy makes some appearances, but it really dives into the world of Angel, and his struggles with redemption. I recommend this to anyone.",1209945600,,809,4.287581699346405

2443949,4,B000BWFWFK,"Season One was terrific.  Angel's darkness & Cordy's energy worked great together &, while I didn't hate Doyle, Wesly added more to the series.  Wolfram & Hart was a terrific idea & the stories were great.  Season Two had some great plot twists with Darla`s rebirth that kept you wondering where it was going.  I was also interesting to see Angel turn dark but not evil & the new cast fit perfectly.  Season Three had all the ingredients that would've made Angel rival BTVS's greatness.  Darla's pregnacy was an exciting & unexpected storyline.  Angel having a child added more demensions to the show, the deepening relationship between him & Cordy was terrific & Holtz was a great villian.  So much potential was there for great future seasons.... until Connor grew up supernaturally fast & Cordy was sent down a path that wouldn`t payoff, ruining everything.

Season Four was the worst of a Joss Whedon show.  The Beast was a cool baddie, seeing Angelius & Faith return to face off as well as some great stories were spectacular.  Unfortunately, their ultimate plan for Connor was a total letdown with it`s convoluted setup that tainted everything Cordy had been through, ruining the season.  Season Five was a breath of fresh air after the disappointing previous season.  Having Angel & Company run Wolfram & Hart was genius and kept things tense.  Spike added some much needed energy, Nina was a great new character that I wish could've been explored more & one of the saddest things I've ever sat through was Cordy's final scene.  Amy's transformation into Illyria was incredible & I liked how the show ended.",1209772800,2,1614,4.839416058394161

However, if you already have all of the seasons there is little reason to buy this set, there is no material that wasn't included with the individual seasons other than a letter to the fans from Joss Whedon. I, however, had none of the seasons so this was a money and space saver. My only complaint, if it can be called that, is that there is no indication of which episodes have commentaries and on which  disks the special features are on. It certainly isn't a deal breaker and I can either make a list for myself or go online to find the list as I am sure that several fans have compiled lists.",1208995200,,805,4.33112582781457

2443958,4,B000BWFWFK,"I wasn't a regular viewer of ""Buffy"" but I did manage to catch a few episodes here and there. Same with ""Angel"". But I do have to say the episodes I did see I thought were very edgy and well written even for a TV series.
One episode that comes to mind is ""Reunion"". I thought Julie Benz (who plays Darla) was one of the cutest girls I'd ever seen. It was by pure coincidence that I remembered that episode when I saw this set on the Gold Box deal on Amazon. No brainer! I received the set a couple of days later. And I have to say even without seeing most of the ""Buffy"" episodes you can still enjoy ""Angel"" completely as a separate series.
I'm glad that seasons 2-5 are in widescreen letterbox format since I have a big screen TV (1080p upconvert brings it to near HD!). A little curious about that since Joss Whedon said he didn't want to show ""Buffy"" in letterbox for artistic reasons. But I'm glad ""Angel"" was released in widescreen. If they do the same for ""Buffy"", I understand the UK version is. I'll get it too.
It seems that a lot of the cool TV shows were cancelled around 2004 to make room for reality shows or perhaps ""other reasons"". If you watch Season 5 closely, you may notice some clues...
If you're into the Vampire, Demons, and monsters genre with a hip and modern twist, this is the show for you. Even if you aren't, there's a lot about this show that most people will enjoy.",1207699200,,1395,4.2481203007518795

2443966,5,B000BWFWFK,"I've been a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on and off since it first came on the air.  Eventually I started picking up TV series on DVD and bought a few of the seasons I hadn't seen of Buffy, which led to me buying all of them, at a combined price (over 5 years) of over 300 dollars.

With Angel, on the other hand, I had the luck of this package.  It's cheap and nicely put together--perfect for anyone looking to explore the show without knowing much about it.

The show itself strives to set itself apart from Buffy in many ways, with a more mature cast and theme.  The show is strongly written with dialogue, though it's plotlines can range from dark and serious to reveling in it's own absurdity. Thanks to that, It houses some really powerful moments, and some really funny ones (if you purchase this set, a letter from the creator will point out a few, I won't list them here).

While the entire show is worth at least a single viewing, The highlight of the show is the Fifth season, where the show really hits a brilliant stride with the character development and selection being absolutely perfect. It creates a pardox on itself--It's a great season that makes you want to see more, but it was the cancellation of the show that prompted much of the storyline that made it unforgettable.

If you're into this genre, or another Joss Whedon creation, this is definitely worth picking up.",1207180800,,1394,4.486166007905139
2443967,5,B000BWFWFK,"OMG when Angel came in the mail Amazon packed it in this huge box that to my suprise when opened at the bottom was a little Angel box. The complete collection was so small, completely unexpected. The Boxset is so small that it is the size of 2 Buffy seasons next to one another. I'm very tempted to buy the complete Buffy boxset just for the size of it, even though I already own all of them.  I'm not an Angel fan, I'm a Spike fan which is why I bought the collection. It was such a great price for the entire collection that I thought why not buy them all. Angel is a very good show and I'll be contining the story through the season 6 comics.
I give Amazon a star for speedy delivery, a star and a half for the super chibi cute box and 2 and a half stars for the show. 5 stars Go Spike!!!",1207094400,,791,3.94375
2443968,5,B000BWFWFK,"I got this set when Amazon was having it on ""Lightning Deals.""  We got it for about $55 and I figured I had to take advantage.  I already owned the first 3 seasons but needed the second 2.  This worked out well as I now own the completed collection and have sold my original ones to help pay for the new.

I am kind of old-fashioned, I guess, and actually enjoyed having the big old sets.  I thought they would be the same in the collectors set.  The set comes in very small packaging.  It comes in CD-sized holders, one for each season, that fits into this collectors box.  I guess it is nice and doesn't take up as much space, but I am just used to the old way and was a tad disappointed when I got my set in the mail.  I have since gotten over it as it really doesn't matter.

Angel is a wonderfully creative series.  It is one of the first series my husband and I actually watched together (besides sitcoms).  He is a little picky about which shows he is dedicated to.  It was fun to bond on the couch watching Angel when it was airing.  It is cleaverly written, just as Buffy was, and has a interesting story-line.  Although we felt the last season was getting a little dull (just a little), we still enjoyed watching this show until the end.  It was very entertaining and I love how they made up this whole other world and way of life for us to enjoy and think about long after the show was over!  You kind of get wrapped up in it.

If you have never seen this series or wonder if it is worth the money, it is (as long as it is a Lightning Deal)!!  It is very entertaining and enjoyable.",1206921600,,1593,4.097087378640777
2443969,4,B000BWFWFK,"A spinoff of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" always seemed a bit redundant in some ways--if you've ever seen Buffy, it's really just more of the same. But ""the same"" is a lot of fun, and they did come up with a few quirks to distinguish it from its parent show, like the Raymond Chandler/film noir vibe of the first two seasons, and the villainous law firm of Wolfram & Hart, who were a consistantly entertaining group of foils for the heroes. They paid off especially well in the show's brilliant fifth and final season, which cleverly reinvented both Wolfram & Hart and the show itself. In a way, that final season felt like the first one in which this show really found its own distinct voice, theme, and structure, but there was plenty of good stuff in the prior seasons as well.

Still, even the weaker stuff--like the muddled middle of the fourth season--is still about ten times more entertaining than the average genre show. While this is a ""darker"" show than Buffy, it still keeps a healthy sense of its own ridiculousness, and the imagination on display is more than enough to carry you over the frequently cheesy special effects and the sometimes overly-convoluted plots. It's also worth noting that the basically adult cast is often more likeable than the oh-so-hip teenagers of Buffy.

I picked this boxed set up for a little over $50, which was definitely more than worth it. If you're going to buy a single season, I'd recommend #2 or #5, though of course you should try and see the whole series in order to get the full impact of the final season (and watching Buffy wouldn't hurt either). Yes, this is a lot like modern superhero comics in terms of storytelling structure, but at least there's not 50 years worth of continuity you have to follow!",1206662400,,1767,4.642172523961661

With Cordelia changing into a good fighter and listener, I was stunned. I never really like the character in Buffy but in this, yeah. Also a great chemistry between her and Angel was also ""gnial"". The same thing apply to Angel wich I didn't like for his side of too much sadness in Buffy but at least, they change the character in Angel. Learn to be more opened and doing joke was overwhelming. The cast was great (weasly, gunn, fred, lorne, and everyone else). The story was great too, but less in season four and five because of some people who died and that I was greatly attached to them.

2443976,4,B000BWFWFK,"Angel aired from 1999-2004 during five great seasons after what it was unfortunatly cancelled and that decision made by the WB network is still questionned now. Originally a spin-off from the popular Buffy The Vampire Slayer,it became much more as it had a life of its own and it appealed to a more mature audience who liked the darker edge of the series. Angel was a character on Buffy for the first three seasons and the vampire with a soul then moved to Los Angeles the city of lost angels(rim shot)to form his crime investigations. Angel met quite a few people over the years and many people worked for him,he fought many monsters. At first there was only Angel,Cordelia and Doyle but it grew to have Wesley,Guns,Fred,Lornes,Harmony and even Spike coming to the series. It might have only last five seasons but that left us some great televison that we can now enjoy anytime we want on DVD.

As far as I am concerned there are three parts to Angel:

The first part,season one is the introduction of the series with a monster-of-the-week approach and is an excellent first season,it is to note that this is a full season with 22 episodes as each Angel seasons had. Angel starts his dectective agency with ex-Buffy Cordelia and Doyle's help. Doyle dies and is replaced by Wesley a former Buffy as well,we also meet Charles Gun who at the time was a Vampire Hunter and was basicly living in the streets with his gang.

The second part is season 2 to 4. In the second season vampire Darla who was Angel's lover a long time ago(and turned him into a vampire)returns and gets pregnant by the end of the season. There are up and downs to this relationnship and it gets Angel mad and he turns against his friends for a bref period of time(also in this season,Angel sings karaoke wich is priceless!).In season three Darla is carrying Angel's son Connor and he nearly didn't get born due to his parents. Holtz with whom Angel had encounters in the past returns and wants to kill the child. Wesley steals Connor and Holtz steals it from him. There are lots of emotions in this season and Angel needs to deal with the fact that he now is a father. Season four was very confusing with all that was going on and it was really crazy. This is when Cordelia left the series(before coming back briefly for Angel's 100th episode in the fifth season)and the issue with her and Connor was unappropriate and rather shocking. Angel is a the bottom of the ocean,a new character Jasmine is introduced but her role wasn't good enough and didn't last long enough. There is also this issue about a beast. Its at the end of the season that Angel Investigations are being given control of Wolfram And Hart office wich opens the door for some more stories and the fifth season of Angel.

Season five returns to its monster-of-the-week format and completes the serie. After being given control of the LA Wolfram And Hart office they can't stop wondering what the catch is. Spike returns from the dead at the beggening of the season and adds much interrest in the series and it was thrilling to see him on Angel. The first half of the season is great episodes wile the second half turns more dramatic with the Fred/Illyria story and Wesley comfronts his father. Angel makes a deal with the devil and we loose some of the crew members. It ended good in my opinion,but the ending receved mixed reactions. It was definatly the funniest season.

The set has all the thirty discs from the sets with their respective special features,wich are pretty good with some interviews and the 100th celebration and great stuff truly. It doesn't offer anything more than a convenient size and the possibility to buy the entire series all at once without looking for each separate seasons. It looks great with a nice box and the discs are placed by seasons inside and it was done really well,but ou have to see it to know what I mean. The only problem I have is the price amazon.ca sells it for. Over 100 bucks for this package when if you look well you can find each seasons for 14.99?No thanks i'd rather buy them speratly but if this set comes at a lower price(it might be right now depending when you are reading this)and you are a fan of the show then go for it. If not for the price its nice. It also comes with a booklet that gives info about each episodes and tell wich season they are on. The packaging was really done well for this set I'll tell you what.

The big problem with this is that you HAVE to be a fan of the show to buy this otherwise you might end up wasting money. If you are a fan who doesn't own the seasons but always wanted to and see this at a decnt price then go for it. Otherwise try to catch the show or rent a season then decide. Angel really is different than Buffy and its great on its own,with many great episodes and a fascinating story that you really get caught in,great television in perspective.",1203984000,,4889,4.475336322869955

Im a huge fan of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" so I had to just buy the entire show, I was not dissappointed and neither will you be!

2443989,5,B000BWFWFK,"I was so delighted to see this box set being sold at US$70.  That's less than US$15 a season so its a real bargain.

Angel of course is a great but under appreciated show.  Most episodes are consistently strong and I am always impressed by their ability to maintain a story arc.  I think the best example is the Jasmine story arc in Season 4 which, if I'm not wrong, ran the whole season.  They backed away from that a little (apparently because the studio wanted it) in Season 5, and the show suffered because of that, but a weak season of Angel is, in my opinion, superior to a 'strong' season of the myriad TV shows out there.",1202515200,,629,4.2521008403361344

My wife and I have watched the entire series when it was on air, but after getting the ""Chosen One"" collection of the Buffy series, I had to have this one as well.

Every single little detail, from the beginning of the show to the end, contributes to the ending of this show.  You watch it once, and then you have to watch it again to catch them all!  Its outstanding, so fantastic, and I truly believe best thing that Joss Whedon has ever done to date.

If you like fantasy, apocalyptic stories, witty dialog, fantastic acting, incredibly well written detail oriented scripts, and beautiful rich worlds that really come alive, you will love this show.

Its a far cry from the very black and white ""good vs bad"" Buffy.  I hated Buffy, it was so blah to me.  Angel is unique, the heroes struggle, just as you can imagine they would where they real people.  They have crisises they change, they grow, they fall, they struggle for redemption, nothing is black and white, nothing is simple, nothing even come close to simple.  Truly, one of the best things I've ever seen aired on American TV to date.

The costumes can be a little hokey in the beginning of the show, but, honestly who the hell cares about that?  This show is amazing, get over the plastic looking demons, and watch the amazing story unfold.",1201737600,,1175,4.600961538461538

With the abundance of crap coming out of the airwaves, if you're as sick of bastardized entertainment like American Idol or sub-par narrative and hack writing like Smallville, then you owe it to yourself to see Angel. You also owe it to yourself to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, two of Joss Whedon's other television products.

I miss the bonusdisc and Joss favourite episodes (from the Angel series). I think these two items made the Buffy box a great box.  The two boxes have the same design but the exclusion of those two things made me a little disapointed. It's still a great box, especially after the price cut. :-)",1200873600,,442,4.261904761904762

2444008,5,B000BWFWFK,"I remember being a young girl in school and watching the premiere of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".

After seeing the horrible movie, I had hoped that the show would be a little better.

After seeing Angel make his appearance, I was intrigued. When I lost touch of BTVS over the years; one night I came upon ""Angel"" at the beginning of season 2.

I bought myself this set during the holidays because it was a great price & I had loved this show.

From the cool packaging to the humor/storylines; I have fallen madly in love with the show again.

From season 1's trial & errors to the sad ending; I think that Joss Whedon & David Boreanaz were a great team.

The show went through a weird phase in Season 4 (uh Connor & Cordy? Gross) and the whole Apocolypse.

After knowing the show would end in Season 5, I think the writers really stepped up and took the show back to its original roots and kept me on my toes about what would happen next.

Sadly, I felt it ended when it finally had gotten good again.

But a great set to have and to watch again and again.",1200096000,2,1056,4.213930348258707
2444009,5,B000BWFWFK,"I have to say that when my Angel Box Set came in today I felt like a giddy child I know silly for an adult but still the truth. There was NO damage on my delivery and I am a little disappointed by the title series on the disks not like the original series as you buy them one season at a time but that little detail is not going to stop me from watching the whole series again and again.
I watched Angel since day one when it first came out on tv and then all the reruns but the reruns had stopped in my area so I guess that is a blessing in disguise.
What is good about this box set is even after I am dead and gone my daughter will get it and I know she will watch it as much as I am going to.
I would recommend this box set to anyone and everyone that is an Angel fan. Now that he is on Bones I will more then likely buy that series too when it comes on sale. I find that his character, unlike when he played Angel needs to grow on you. I have to be honest the first time I watched it I was not held captive by his acting the show made him look and sound like an airhead but now that I have been watching it for a bit now it isnt' so bad of a show. I may have good taste in shows but I am very cheap lol.
Thanks Amazon I will be a returning customer over and over again as long as you ship as well as you do and you deliver when you say you are going to and this time actually before the estimated time of delivery.
I am sorry that this is not a detail of the Angel series but in order for people to appreciate the show is to actually watch it and find out for yourself and enjoy it as much as I do.",1200009600,3,1602,3.673469387755102
2444010,5,B000BWFWFK,"Well, I agree with the more positive reviewers about the actual show content. Angel has it's ups and downs, but still one of my favorite television shows.

Anyway, I just received this product in the mail today, and was so completely excited it was slightly ridiculous. It came from Amazon well packaged, and the actual DVD box had very little damage to it - just a slight rip in the hinge for the cover, and by slight I mean maybe 3/4 of a inch at most. The inside of the hinge was fine, it was just the outside paper. Other than that, no structural problems. I checked the DVD's in their plastic holders - a little worried after all the problems people seemed to have with the Buffy set - and found nothing wrong. All plastic DVD trays were intact, and none of the DVD's were scratched or warped. Overall, the quality was excellent.

The only sad thing is, with this set, you don't get the original DVD labels from the individual sets. Take say, Season 1, instead of spelling out ""Angel"" it just has various pictures of David Boreanaz as Angel. Also, even in the first season, there is only one picture of Glenn Quinn in the entire set - I was a little miffed about that, since I think Doyle helped set in motion some of the emotion carried at least part of the way through the entire series.

Overall, good set to buy if you don't already own the seasons separately. If you do, it's probably not worth it.",1199923200,4,1408,4.366412213740458

2444016,5,B000BWFWFK,"Angel is one of the best series ever produced on TV, which tells the story of a vampire with a soul bent on redemption to right the wrongs of his dark past. A spin-off series made after the first 3 years of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel is a series that rivaled (even bettered!) it's parent show! The writing was top notch, the acting was amazing, the special effects are stunning, and the storylines were shocking. Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt really created a brilliant series which blended dark storytelling, classic humor, fantastic fights and original characters flawlessly. From it's refreshing first season to the sinister events of it's fifth and final season, Angel was an inventive yet short lived series that put a new spin on redemption with gripping storylines. Each season had strong themes and episodes that always tested the core cast that made up Team Angel: Angel, Cordelia, Wesley, Gunn, and Fred with Lorne as their lovable ally. All 5 glorious seasons can be summed up like this:

Season 1 (1999-2000)-Angel, a vampire with a soul, arrives in L.A. ready to start his road to redemption but finding a hard time to control his thirst for blood. Doyle, a mysterious half-demon Irish bad boy, comes to Angel and reveals he is a messenger for the Powers That Be. With his visions, Doyle guides Angel to the innocents of L.A. he must protect. One of them being Cordelia, the smart mouthed ex-rich girl from Sunnydale, who joins Angel and Doyle on the mission to save the lost souls of L.A. by creating a detective agency, Angel Investigations. But the trio better beware, Law firm Wolfarm and Hart is an enemy that will continue to do battle with them. A battle that will unleash a variety of demons, vampires, even slayer threats that will cost the lives of the group and bring new allies, like Wesley, to the table.

2444017,5,B000BWFWFK,"I have nothing to say about the product in general, Amazon's mailing practices, the actual content of the show (which along with Buffy is one of my all time favorites) but what's up with the lower price?

I got this through Amazon as a preorder. I thought the cost break I was getting was because it let them know how many they should buy and so help them to cater to their customers. Now it is on sale for 30 dollars, more or less, than I paid for it. Somehow this does not seem fair. It makes me question ever doing business with Amazon in the future. I did not get it preorder to be the first on my block or to get it before anyone else I couldh ave waited, but I thoguth I would never be able to get an unused copy at a lower price. I did it because it got me a cost break and I do not have that much money to splurge on such luxaries. Now I find it actually cost me more than if I had just waited a month and a half.

If nothing else I will never purchase anything from Amazon preorder or even in the first month of its release. They will no longer be my first provider for items if they will only later sell it for less for no discernable reason I can see and cheat me out of money I could have saved. I'll check with local stores and other online services first.

But don't get me wrong the DVD set is great as is the show. I only have a beef with the half price sale that basically cheated me out of 30+ dollars.",1198627200,3,1420,3.923611111111111

The only negative is that it only lasted 5 seasons. It could have and should have continued. This is the first review I have ever written, and possibly the last. Enjoy it as much as I have.",1198540800,,536,4.114285714285714
2444020,5,B000BWFWFK,"To begin I must confess, the only time I have watched Angel..was after it arrived at my door this week in a cute little package. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge ""Buffy"" fan and own the Chosen Collection (Seasons 1-7). But because I have only recently started watching Angel, this review is for the boxset itself.

Since, I have the Chosen collection, I cannot help but compare the two.  Angel the series comes in a (obviously) box, with 5 separate DVD holders that layer to make the face of our lovely brooding Vamp-hero-person guy. The sturdiness of the DVD holders caught my eye right off, they are much better than those in the Chosen collection (which were basically bonded with a weak adhesive) The box kinda folds apart, when you lift the lid, a panel falls down so you can see all the DVD season holders, the panel that falls down has a color pic of the Angel Cast. (this is similar to the Chosen collection)

The set includes a color-print booklet that outlines each episode with a short description. Each page highlights 3-4 episodes (the same number of eps. on the corresponding disc) and on the opposite page is a breakdown of the chapters in each show.

The most exciting feature (for me) is the letter from Joss Whedon to the ""Angel Fan"". A full letter comes folded in a blue envelope in which Joss Whedon discusses Angel, they whys and hows, and highlights some of his favorite moments. In comparison to the letter in the Chosen collection, Angel takes the cake.

The set is a bit pricey, but if you don't already have the individual seasons and like me, have been thinking and thinking that you MUST watch Angel in order to feel like a true Buffy-verse fan, then go ahead, indulge yourself! ;)

Though I am technically a new fan (not even through the 1st season yet!), for this past show,  it has already made me laugh and cry. Some old and new faces to fall in love with.

So sit back, and let the dark mysterious stranger that is our beloved Angel entertain you, I don't think he will disappoint, he hasn't me yet!

If you already own the Buffy:Chosen set, I can tell you that this is an excellent companion set. It's designed in the same exact fashion. I think it's exactly what Whedon fans wanted and have been waiting for the Angel series. If you already own all the original season dvds of Angel, then this might not be the best deal for you as you won't get much else.

Still, it's a great space saver, very well-organized, and fits nicely beside the Buffy set.",1195862400,9,625,4.333333333333333

I think the other reviews have pretty much covered it, but I had to add my sorrow that Angel only lasted 5 short seasons.  It should have gone on at least two more and it would still have been fresh, exciting, challenging, and pushing the envelope.

A note on the full series - unlike the MacGyver series I just bought, they did a tremendous job in the packaging of this set.  Very nicely done!!!!  The only thing that would make it better would be if a few more seasons suddenly appeared......",1194912000,8,533,4.343434343434343

My disappointment in this set is that there is no mention of ""Doyle"" and the part he planned in the 1st season. I understand the real-life drama but Glenn Quinn's character was as crucial to the 1st season as Charisma Carpenter's.

My other disappointment is that there aren't any ""new"" extras.

I like the packaging and that it makes it easy to find your favorite episode or season.

It deals with many themes, from finding ones path in life to dying for what you believe in. It's hard to imagine a world without hope and Angel proves to us that so long as we do our part, there will always be hope. Five seasons was not enough and I truly miss this wonderful show. I only hope that someday in the future the WB will be able to produce a show that will live up to the standards that Angel left them. In ordering Angel it is my personal guarantee that you will not be dissapointed.

2444037,5,B000BWFWFK,"With the ever growing popularity of the character on the hit Buffy the Vampire Slayer, creator Joss Whedon gave tortured vampire with a soul Angel (David Boreanaz) his own show, which found the titular vamp treking to Los Angeles to open his own investigation service meant to ""help the helpless"".  As the series begins, Angel accompanied by Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) and demonic liason Doyle (the late Glen Quinn) as Angel goes head to head with demonic lawfirm Wolfram & Hart.  Later on, characters new and old like former Watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), demon street fighter Gunn (J. August Richards), physiscist Fred (Amy Acker), and fellow vampire with a soul Spike (James Marsters) would join the cast as the show ran the course of it's five seasons, with the best parts definitely coming in the second, third, and fourth seasons; beginning with Angel's resurrected former lover Darla (Julie Benz) returning, and their offspring Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) making his presence felt during a revenge driven quest against his father, which results in an unlikely union and an even more demonic offspring that puts a new and interesting twist on the apocalypse.  The final season of Angel however is the low point of the series, as Carpenter's wry wit is missed (though she does return for one episode) as Angel and his crew take control of Wolfram & Hart, and prepare to make a last stand, which leads to the quite underwhelming series finale.  All that aside, Angel was special because it was one of the few times that a spin-off managed to live up to the original show it was spun from, and in that respect alone, Angel was a sight to behold.",1188345600,25,1653,4.871886120996441

2444039,5,B000BWFWFK,"Warning!  Contains major spoilers!

I recently watched a great documentary about the women stunt double's Jeannie Epper and Zo Bell.  The latter was Lucy Lawless's stunt double on XENA, though she is now perhaps best known for her work as Uma Thurman's double in KILL BILL and her amazing work playing herself in DEATH PROOF (she was the New Zealand chick on the hood of the Dodge Challenger).  The extras included an interview with Quentin Tarantino and one of the things they asked him was his thoughts on XENA, the show on which Bell first performed (as Lucy Lawless points out, two women portrayed Xena, but only one really got credit).  His analysis of XENA was, I think, really profound.  The central idea was that Xena was someone who had committed crimes so extensive and so extreme that even though she had turned to the path of doing good, she was never going to be able to balance things.  No matter how many good things she did, the bad would still overshadow them.  As he puts it, not matter what she does ""she'll only be paying ten cents on the dollar.""  The second I heard this from Tarantino, I realized that he was describing not only Xena but also Angel.  If anything, Angel's crimes were worse than Xena's because he not only killed his victims, but also robbed them of their souls.  Rarely has television seen such an extended examination of the possibilities of personal salvation.

XENA and ANGEL had one other thing in common.  Both were among the most successful spin offs in TV history.  Though XENA never garnered the critical acclaim that either BUFFY or ANGEL achieved, it far surpassed HERCULES in both popularity and critical acclaim.  ANGEL never eclipsed BUFFY as XENA did HERCULES, but it nonetheless became one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV.  Its cancellation following its fifth season, when it was one of the highest rated shows on the WB, remains one of the most mystifying of the past decade.  The fan campaign to save the show far surpassed the successful campaign to save JERICHO this year.  And although Joss Whedon has recently announced that he intends to produce ANGEL Season 6 in comic form, just as he is currently undertaking BUFFY Season 8 on Darkhorse Comics, ANGEL continues to be missed by its fans.

One of the many things that made ANGEL so great was that the show not only focused on the central arc concerning Angel, but also featured fully developed arcs for all the major characters.  The show was not simply about Angel, but almost equally about the other characters as well.  Although Angel was clearly the central character, the show was very much about the chosen family that was created around him.  Cordelia, Doyle, Wesley, Gunn, Fred, Lorne, and finally Spike and Illyria managed to form a caring if frequently dysfunctional family.  Ironically, the one person who was not able to become a part of that family was Angel's own son, who never really meshed either with the overall narrative or with the other characters.

But at the center of the show from beginning to end was Angel's quest to try and be a force for good despite all the evil he afflicted.  He wasn't in the least convinced that he could make amends (""Amends"" was, in fact, the title of possibly the greatest of the Angel episodes on BUFFY) and he was pretty much convinced that in the end good might not win out over evil, but something he tells Detective Kate Lockley in the Season Two episode ""Epiphany"" gets to the heart of the show.  Although she never invites him into his house, he nevertheless is able to enter her apartment when he realizes that she has attempted suicide.  He helps save her life and afterwards they are talking.  He explains that he has to strive to do what is right not knowing if he will be successful, knowing that ""there are no big wins.""  This is similar to the idea expressed in the very last line in the series, when Angel tells his friends, faced with fighting an overwhelming army of evil creatures, ""Let's get to work.""  The whole idea is to not worry about results, but only worry about intent, to make sure you are striving to do good, to not give up or into despair.

It was not a perfect show.  It was, in fact, a fairly unlucky show.  There were also a couple of ill-advised story arcs.  In Season Three there was the absolutely bizarre idea of Angel's son Connor, easily the most unpopular character in the Slayerverse, rivaled distantly by Dawn on BUFFY.  Even worse was the decision to make Cordy evil in Season Four.  And even worse was the abuse of the magnificent Gina Torres as Jasmine in Season Four.  The result was that the last quarter of Season Three (in what was otherwise a magnificent season) and most of Season Four were possibly the worst thing that ever happened on a Joss Whedon show.  Even worse than all of this was the brief sexual pairing of Connor and Evil Cordy in Season Four, a sequence that registered as high on the Ick-o-meter as anything ever seen on prime time television.  Things were also hurt by Charisma Carpenter's unanticipated leave of absence towards the end of Season Three (which caused some rapid rewriting of several episodes) and her delay in informing Whedon and Co. that she was pregnant in Season Four.  This resulted in her being written out of the show, though she did make a wonderful farewell appearance in a single Season Five episode.

But despite the problems with the end of Season Three and the myriad of problems in Season Four, the show never ceased to be less than fascinating.  Even Season Four had some marvelous episodes, including the haunting season premiere, the marvelous comic episode ""Spin the Bottle,"" and the three-part Faith sequence in the middle of the season.  There were also some amazing special effects in Season Four as well as the Beast, an absolutely haunting Big Bad.  The show did manage to rally for a wonderful Season Five, complete with the addition of Spike from BUFFY.  By the end of the season Spike and Angel had come to form a great team and had the show returned for another year the show would have become something of a buddy show centered on them.

Speaking of Season Six, we know something of what would have happened thanks to producer Jeffrey Bell, who shared some of the ideas they were developing.  There was, for instance, talk of an episode in which Angel and Spike would have undertaken a case that would have required them to go in drag.  But the most fascinating arc definitely centered on Illyria.  Although the goddess Illyria had taken over Fred's body, supposedly destroying her soul, in Season Six we would have found that this was wrong.  Allyson Hanigan would have guest starred as Willow and would have performed a spell that would have allowed Fred to come back.  Illyria, however, would not have disappeared.  Instead, Amy Acker would have played both characters.  When Bell in interviews shared all this my anger at the WB (good riddance to a bad network) reflamed.  Wesley would not, of course, have died had there been a Season Six, and I can just imagine the dynamics between Wesley and Fred on the one hand, and an intensely powerful Illyria who had something resembling a crush on Wesley.

Still, the good on the show dramatically outweighed the bad and even at its worst it remained one of the best shows on television.  And although one can be angry at it being cancelled when there were still some wonderful story arcs to be told, one can also be grateful that we got five full seasons.  It definitely goes on the list of the best shows on television of the past twenty years.",1186272000,218,7587,4.649662415603901
2444040,5,B000BWFWFK,"So ""Angel"" is just a spin-off of the legendary ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series right?  Surely Joss Whedon just delivered this as some sort of a second-rate cash-in to Buffy's success by focusing on her [...] goody two-shoes vampire ex-boyfriend.  So why bother?  Well, how about the fact that the show started off damn near as good as ""Buffy"" and was arguably better when some dimwit at the WB decided to pull the plug after what is easily one of the finest seasons of sci-fi/fantasy television ever to hit the air.  Angel is set up as a lonely soul who begins protecting the citizens of the night in Los Angeles from vampires and demons.  He quickly meets a friend who speaks of his destiny and mission and then meets a familiar face, Buffy's friend/rival Cordelia Chase, currently pursuing an acting career.  The threesome form a small detective agency specializing in supernatural cases and vowing to ""help the helpless"".  Along the way, we find that Angel is to be a major instrument of the coming apocalypse, but it is unclear whether it will be as a hero to save the day or as his super-villainesqe alter-ego, Angelus, to help end the world.  Remember, Angel was the worst killer in vampire history until gypsies restored his soul so that he would feel the agony of regret over his past deeds for all eternity.  Should Angel lose his soul (by experiencing a moment of perfect happpiness; nice touch, jerks), then Angelus will arise from within Angel and wreak havok once again.  But it's not all dark, brooding, and depressing; far from it, the show is actually quite light-hearted much of the time.  Like in ""Buffy"" (and all of Whedon's work, for that matter), character humor is almost always at the forefront. The show veers from kicking butt to causing tears of laughter to breaking your heart as effortlessly as any show ever has.

The first season returned to a familiar monster/metaphor-of-the-week formula, but while ""Buffy"" focused on teen and, later, young adult issues ""Angel"" used supernatural metaphors to explore 20 and 30-something issues such as the singles bar scene, corporate exploitation, and street violence.  Season one was also predictably full of ""Buffy"" cross-overs and familiar faces from that show's past and present, but regardless of the fact that this was just an easy way to pull in viewers, the result is nearly flawless entertainment that makes you WANT to watch both shows. In the best example of this, rogue vampire hunter Faith flees from Buffy after assaulting her in Sunnydale on that show and winds up meeting up with Angel's crew the week after in L.A.  When Buffy shows up to take her pound of flesh out of a repentant Faith's rear, Angel is forced to step in and confront the love of his life to save his enemy's soul.  Viewed along with the Buffy's episodes, you've got a complete and compelling story of my personal favorite character from either show.  Season two really hit it's stride by bringing back Angel's vampiric sire, Darla, and eventually her delightfully insane makeshift sister, Drusilla, a victim of Angelus's past transgressions.  Angel's battles with his ex-family lead him and the show to very dark places, placing distance between his new family, which now includes an vampire hunting gang leader named Gunn and Buffy's ex-watcher (and former bozo), Wesley.  Seasons three and four are filled with brilliance, but take a few turns for the worst when the inevitable kid becomes involved.  Teen angst adds nothing to this show in my opinion and puts these two seasons head-and-shoulders beneath the other three.  This is not to say that they aren't awesome and absolutely vital viewing for any fan of the supernatural genre, they just aren't of the flawless caliber of seasons, one, two, and five.  If you minimize the overwrought Connor-based storylines, seasons three and four are still absolute top-notch entertainment and deliver some of the series' greatest moments, not the least of which is the anticipated return of Angelus, just in time for the apocalypse.  Season five is a complete rebirth of the series and, in my opinion, it is the absolute peak of the show that arguably surpasses ""Buffy"" on many levels.  We say our tearful goodbyes to beloved characters and welcome more in their place.  Bringing back Angelus's old comrade Spike (now with a soul of his own, muddying up the waters of the old prophecy) was considered a bad move by many, but I've always found the character's snarky humor irresistable. When Illyria, an ancient goddess of formerly all-consuming power, shows up in shocking fashion the result is a consistently intriguing side-story that runs the length of the season and a great new character unlike any I've ever seen. In another example of Joss Whedon's bizarre and brilliant genius, Angel is transformed into a puppet (think ""Crank Yankers"") and forced to battle other demon-possessed puppets running a children's show.  This is easily my favorite episode of the entire series and, like the ""Buffy"" musical before it, shows just how hysterically entertaining an episode of television can be.  So, are you convinced that Angel deserved his own show yet?  If not, just trust me and buy this very nicely priced DVD collection.  If you loved ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" you will not, you can not be disappointed by ""Angel"".",1186012800,20,5322,4.922818791946309
2444041,5,B000BWFWFK,"Angel ran an all too short five seasons from 1999-2004, and the now defunct WB network may be defunct in part because of its decision to cancel the show. The story starts out where Buffy The Vampire Slayer season 3 left off, with Angel leaving Sunnydale and his beloved Buffy so that she can have a semblance of a normal life, or at least a normal relationship, which the two of them could never have. The entire series can be divided into three parts, all of which take place in L.A., Angel's new home. I'll warn you right now, there are SPOILERS AHEAD.

The first part consists of season one, and is in monster-of-the-week format rather than the season-long story arcs that Joss Whedon was famous for in Buffy. In season one, Angel starts a supernatural detective agency, ""Angel Investigations"", with the help of Cordelia Chase, who has moved to L.A. after her family lost all of their money the previous year, and half human-half demon Doyle. Doyle dies a courageous death half-way through the season, and Wesley Windham-Pryce joins the cast as a ""rogue demon hunter"" who has been fired from the watcher's council for the Faith debacle in Sunnydale the previous year. In this first season he is the same awkward Wesley we saw in season three of BTVS, but that eventually changes. At the end of the season we are introduced to Charles Gunn, a streetwise kid who has been fighting demons his whole life and ekeing out a meager existence on the street. Slowly, he comes to trust Angel and eventually joins the group.

The second part of the series consists of seasons two through four, and is literally one long story arc. Season two deals with the resurrection of Angel's vampire lover Darla, the one who turned him into a vampire in 1753, and whom he killed in season one of BTVS. The ordeal of getting Darla back as a human, and then losing her again when she becomes a vampire once more, drives Angel to the dark side of his soul. He turns against his friends for a brief time as he goes on a crusade of punishing the guilty - Wolfram & Hart - rather than helping the helpless. Eventually he has an epiphany, and returns to his friends and his senses - but not before he and Darla have a night of passion that results in season three's story arc - Darla's pregnancy and the ""birth"" of Angel's son Conner. Also, at the end of season two the Fang Gang rescues a girl (""Fred"") from an alternate dimension - Pylea - which also happens to be the home dimension of Lorne, an empath demon that has been helping Angel and his friends.

In season 3, Angel is adjusting to fatherhood when an old enemy from his vampire past is mystically conjured up - Holtz, a man whose entire family was killed by Angel and Darla when they were both vampires. Holtz uses Wesley's fear of a prophecy that ""The father shall kill the son"" to get him to steal Angel's son, whom Holtz in turn steals from Wesley. Holtz is cornered by multiple parties who also want Conner, and Holtz takes the infant and jumps into a portal to a hell dimension rather than give up the child. Later in season three, Conner and Holtz both return from the hell dimension. With time running differently in the two dimensions, Conner is now 18 years old, and none too fond of Angel, since Holtz' tales of Angel's cruelty as a vampire have doubtless been Conner's bedtime stories for his entire life. Holtz conjures up a plan to commit assisted suicide and make it look like he has been murdered by Angel so that Conner will take revenge on him. The plan works, and Conner sinks Angel to the bottom of the Pacific in a box, to suffer an everlasting torment of slow starvation.

Season four is the most misunderstood and the wildest ride of any of the seasons. In the first episode, Wesley tries to redeem himself by retrieving Angel from the bottom of the ocean after capturing Conner's accomplice in Angel's imprisonment. Cordelia was made a ""higher power"" at the end of season three, and she suddenly turns up at Angel's doorstep several episodes into season four, unable to remember anything. The rest of the season is a dizzying blur that involves a mysterious Beast that blots out the sun, the temporary unsouling of Angel so that the gang can question Angelus about his memories of the Beast, another mystical pregnancy that culminates in an evil higher power - Jasmine - coming into the world, and that evil power bringing ""world peace"" in return for the world's unquestioning worship - until Angel allows people to see Jasmine's true appearance and they run from her in horror. The season concludes with Angel and his crew being given control of the L.A. branch of evil mystical law firm Wolfram & Hart supposedly as a reward for ""destroying world peace"". Angel agrees to the deal, if in return all memories of Conner's existence are erased from everyone who knew him and if Conner is placed in a ""normal"" family with new planted memories that involve only his new family, and not his actual past. This acts as a reset for all of the emotional pain of the past three years for everyone except Angel, who retains his memories of what actually happened.

Season five basically stands alone and is the third and final part of the series. This final season returns more to the monster-of-the-week format that was present in season one, largely as a condition of WB renewing the show since the confusing labrynth that was season four had not had stellar ratings. Spike, from the now defunct BTVS, is thrown into the mix, at first as a ghost that is unable to leave the premises of Wolfram & Hart. Later in the season Spike reclaims his corporeal presence, though. The first part of the season is on the light side, as each member of the Fang Gang receives their dream job on a platter at Wolfram & Hart, with all of the resources they could ever ask, and the hope of doing good deeds in a place once renowned for evil. Later though, they slowly discover that is they that are being changed and compromised, not the law firm. This culminates in one great tragedy two-thirds into the season, resulting in the death of one the members of the Fang Gang. In the end, Angel and his crew decide to turn the tables and strike at the heart of the players in the Apocalypse by killing all of the members of an evil secret society. They are successful, but there are casualties among their ranks. The last scene shows the survivors cornered in an alley about to be attacked by Wolfram & Hart's minions. When asked what they should do, the last line of the show is Angel telling the others ""Well, Personally? I Kinda Wanna Slay the Dragon."" as he swings a sword and we fade to black. The Fang Gang goes out fighting and we never really know what happened to them, and because the actors have long since gone on to other projects, we never will.

""Angel"" is adult fare from start to finish, not the teen fare of at least the early years of Buffy. However, Joss Whedon's epic tale of a vampire with a soul and his search for redemption is great television. Angel is not the only character on a journey in this series. Throughout the tenure of the show we watch the shallow and selfish Cordelia Chase change into a brave soul who is willing to become part demon in order to continue on in her mission. We also watch as Wesley changes from buffoonish comic relief into a true rogue demon hunter who has a penchant for darkness that rivals Angel. Charles Gunn changes from the street-wise kid who is proud of being the muscle into someone who is willing to sell his soul to not to return to that role. Even Lorne is not spared, as he changes from the consummate entertainer with an ever-sunny personality into someone who can only find solace at the bottom of a glass of alcohol and loses his heart for the good fight ""the moment I found out a girl I loved was going to die"".

8093540,4,B000BWFWFK,"I do not ordinarily like stories involving medieval monsters like vampires and my primary motivation for buying it was to see Amy Acker at the start of her career. She did not disappoint. Neither did Joss Whedon. He managed to take an iffy story like Buffy the Vampire slayer and turn it into not just one, but two highly entertaining tales. The cast in Angel was magnificent; the writing was witty and the plots were well thought out. I never imagined that a story about medieval monstrosities like vampires and demons would ever entertain me, but this series managed to do that quite well.",1518912000,,591,4.6923076923076925
