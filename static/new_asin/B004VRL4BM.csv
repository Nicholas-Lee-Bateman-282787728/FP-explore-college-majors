4483929,5,B004VRL4BM,"Philip released New Dawn and Connor is trapped in the future wasteland. Matt and Abby rescue Connor and return to a world gone bonkers with the New Dawn anomoly increasing in size. Philip sacrifices himself to shut down his folly, but to no avail. The ARC team heads back to their headquarters and battles future predators while Connor works on a solution to the mess Philip's ego created. When all is said and done, the ending leaves room for Season 6 to kick off in 2013.

The creators/producers of the original Primeval series have developed an offshoot series called Primeval New World. This will air in Canada and there is a slight chance of crossover appearances from the cast of the BBC Primeval series. There is also a Primeval movie being developed. For the original BBC Primeval show, there would not be a Season 6 until probably 2013, and there is no confirmation on who the cast members would be.

I have watched Primeval from the beginning and enjoyed watching the growth of the characters Abby Maitland and Connor Temple who are as passionate about their work as they are about each other. James Lester as the snarky boss of the ARC is also one of my favorites. I hope these three come back if there is a Primeval series 6 in 2013.

UPDATE: Primeval New World the Canadian spin-off series began shooting March 2012. The goal of the series is to be darker and edgier than the original UK series and deal with prehistoric anomalies from the past and future in the Northern hemisphere. An entirely different cast has been selected, with only one familiar crossover so far - Andrew Lee Potts. NIall Matter (Zane on Eureka) will be playing an inventor/computer genius in the 13 episode first season. Amanda Tapping, Andy Mikita, Martin Wood and Mike Rohl are set to direct.",1324166400,22,1782,4.686900958466453
4483930,5,B004VRL4BM,"I realize producers hope a show will return when they close the current season with a cliff-hanger, but in this instance it only serves to be a frustrating end to a series that never went on past the final episode of season #5. I don't want to see Primeval: New World; I want to see what happens to the characters established in the original series and, at least, some resolution to this latest plot line - obviously the writers had something in mind for these people and I'm interested in following through to a satisfying conclusion.",1323648000,,535,4.583333333333333
4483931,1,B004VRL4BM,"I recently purchased the blue ray version of Primeval 4 and 5.
I have a Sony BDPS580 blue ray player that is current with available software updates.
the DVD loads and I am at a familar screen where I can select to play the DVD. When I select the DVD the DVD player acts like it it going to play the DVD  but I am returned to the screen where I can select the DVD to play. It is not possible to see any of the contents of the DVD. I did not see anything on the package that would indicate it will not play on DVD players sold in the USA.
Any thoughts?

Right now I rate it with 1 (actually 0) stars because it will not play.

Additional comments posted 12/13/2011
I Googled/Bing'd the bar code label (051561001611) and anther identifier (2EDB0161) that were on the jacket. you can work your way to the BBC web site and there it says the disks are for zone 2. Unfortunately, there is nothing on the DVDs, the packaging, or the Amazon web site that tells you these are Zone 2 DVDs and will not play on blue ray players sold in the USA and canada.

Update from 12/14/2011
I have been told by the seller that some Sony and Panasonic DVDs will not play this DVD. I am going to contact Sony (again) and see if they can provide a firmware update that will allow the DVDs to play.

Update from 3/7/2012
My previous update should have read some Sony and Panasonic blue-ray DVD players will not play this DVD. I did eventually find versions of Primeval that would play on zone 1 DVD layers.",1323648000,6,1480,4.178947368421053

James Lester lends a hand in the parking garage (a hilarious bit) while the ARC team takes down creatures and tries to stop Philip from destroying the world.

4483933,5,B004VRL4BM,"One of the things that Primeval does best is encapsulated storylines. This is one of their best, with the ARC team trapped aboard a submarine with a prehistoric baby sea creature. It goes from bad to worse when the sub is sucked into the anomoly with much larger prehistoric sea creatures banging the submarine about like a toy. The British Navy raises the stakes even higher by sending a torpedo to nuke the anomoly with the submarine inside. James Lester battles the British Navy over the right to command and bring about the correct solution. And in the end, someone has a lot of explaining to do to the Prime Minister. Great episode.",1323216000,,637,4.646017699115045

In this episode we find Emily back in London hunting a raptor at night, while her husband is making plans to put her into an asylum. Matt chases a raptor into Victorian London and runs into Emily and they team up to track the creature and send it back through to our time for capture. Matt finally admits his feelings to Emily and she has to make a decision - stay in a loveless marriage and be committed to bedlam or come back with Matt to our time.",1323129600,,614,4.256410256410256
4483937,5,B004VRL4BM,"This is a prime example of exellent British programming.  The special effects are terrific; the casting more than adequate; the screen writing very good.  Season 5 of the series is picking up pace from season 4.  The majority of the episode takes place on a British submarine under the ocean where very large predators from millions of years ago are attacking the crew and ARC team sent to close an under water anomaly.

If you like Science Fiction or just good action and adventure you will not be disappointed.  This could be the last year of thus series.  I hope not!  It's one of the better scifi's on British or U.S. TV.",1322611200,3,625,4.526785714285714
4483938,5,B004VRL4BM,"- Mission coordinator Jess Parker on the monitors (as anomalies crop up everyfriggin'where!): ""I don't believe it! There's another one. It - it's outside! The car park!""
- The ARC Director James Lester: ""Oh my god! My new Jag's in the car park! This time it's personal!""

***First off, this DVD is Region 2. Next, there is a Region 1 DVD already out (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Volume-Three/dp/B004QOB8TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval: Volume Three</a>) which contains Series 4 & this one, Series 5 (thanks, FYI!!!)***

There was a point in Series 1 in which I thought the insidious Helen Cutter was a redeemable character. But she proved me wrong, and all the way thru to Series 3, she persisted in proving me wrong. And more than a year past her death, Helen Cutter's diabolical legacy lives on, perpetuated in the shape of Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig), philanthropist, scientist, and currently ARC's primary deep pockets. It's Philip Burton now who advances Helen's apocalyptic agenda.

So this is PRIMEVAL - THE COMPLETE SERIES FIVE, and on two discs it collects all six episodes, and I'm not sure there'll be any more after this, even though the concluding chapter does leave us once again tantalized and craving. As this series opens, whiz kid Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) is drifting away from his ARC (Anomaly Research Centre) teammates, and especially from his girlfriend Abby (Hannah Spearritt). Connor's been lacking a bit of team spirit and had been somewhat remissed in deploying with the others as they investigate temporal anomalies and fend off creature incursions. His time toiling away at Philip Burton's top secret New Dawn project has kept him away from the field. Again, as with last season, it's frustrating that Connor still harbors a man crush on Philip, out of whose genius bum he thinks the sun radiantly shines.

If you haven't yet seen Series 4, there's no need to read this following paragraph because in it there be Series 4 SPOILERS. But if you've seen Series 4, then you're aware that new team leader, Matt Anderson, actually hails from a dying Earth in the future and that he had Kyle Reese'd it to the present to avert an impending cataclysm. Matt had confessed as much to Abby and, furthermore, had let it slipped that Burton's New Dawn project is the doomsday device he intends to shut down. Except that there's Connor's adoration at Burton's feet to mull over. So, essentially, there's your ongoing character conflict.

I've written about PRIMEVAL's previous seasons, and I'm in danger now of regurgitating a heap of praises so glowing they've set off the Geiger counter. Suffice it, Series 5 continues PRIMEVAL's tradition of gripping drama and high adventure - with a strong dash of sci-fi horror - and ripping special effects. Not to mention the unexpected character arcs and the inadvertent history lessons in paleontology. Even though, of late, I've been exasperated with Connor and that blind eye when it comes to Philip Burton, he and Abby are still my favorite characters. And I guess having them fall smoothly into a nice and perfect romantic relationship would be too dull of a thing. Ben Miller's take on his character, the deliciously sardonic ARC Director James Lester, is friggin' superb and so very funny. It helps that he gets the best lines. I'm even starting to warm up to Ciarn McMenamin, whose Matt Anderson I'd once thought automaton-bland. He sparks it up some in this series. I hope to Gargamel that there is a Series 6 in the offing. But, if not, and even with the cliffhanger ending, this is a fine way to go out. Series 5's final episode is an explosive one, fraught with desperate danger and a fight for all the marbles and the return of ARC's next most fiendish foe (after Helen Cutter). And there's also James Lester's priceless one-liner about his new Jag.

Bonus feature: ""New Dawn - Making the new PRIMEVAL Part 2"" - an overview of Series 5 with particular focus on the sets and the digital f/x, and with cast & crew interviews (00:15:33 minutes long).

Remember: read the Region Code before you purchase this DVD set.

The following is a list of brief episode breakdowns for Series 5. Read further at your peril - you've been SPOILER ALERTed:

- Episode 1 - The team takes on giant burrowing, chittering crustaceans in the tunnels beneath London. Connor's eyes are all aglow as Philip unveils his New Dawn enterprise. Also, in a great little sub-plot, Lester learns that he is being considered for knighthood.

- Episode 2 - The ARC team is trapped in a dead submarine that wanders thru an anomaly in British waters. This claustrophobic episode features a nasty theropod lurking aboard the submarine and a pod of Liopleurodons swimming about outside the submarine.

- Episode 3 - When the ARC team inadvertently sets a raptor loose in 1868 London, Matt steps thru the anomaly in hot pursuit and runs into Emily Merchant. This, even as reports of the infamous Spring-heeled Jack begin to dominate the Victorian-era news media.

- Episode 4 - Connor's manufactured anomaly becomes a portal for a swarm of voracious future beetles that can burrow thru reinforced concrete. Some personal satisfaction for me in this episode as Connor's mates spend much time glaring accusatory daggers at him.

- Episode 5 - A Tyrannosaurus Rex terrorizes London, and off goes the ARC team. But then other anomalies begin to open up all over the globe which seriously depletes ARC's manpower and ability to respond. Meanwhile, Philip is poised to launch New Dawn.

- Episode 6 - It's the end of the world as we know it. Also, Future Predators, Future Predators, and Future Predators. And a bit of time travel.",1315094400,30,5724,4.955161626694474

4484029,2,B004VRL4BM,"I watched all five seasons back to back and this season is by far the worst of all.  The show was always cheesy, with the very fake looking monsters and horrifically bad science, but this season takes stupidity and poor writing to a whole new level.  The team is alternately brilliant and completely retarded as they do a lot of posing and standing around when they need to act fast.  Phillip is a rehash of Helen only male, just as shallow and two dimensional, a egomaniacal moron,whose motivations are incredulous at best.  Just dumb, dumb, dumb!  Lots of contrived suspense which was mostly just irritating.",1466380800,,610,4.771428571428571

Amateur special effects, stilted dialog, bad acting, and adolescent, predictable, lame plots make this a non-starter for me. Oh yeah, once again a pneumatic nail gun happens to be lying on the floor for the hero to pick-up at the last second and dispatch the monster...  Every since Lethal Weapon this has been idiotic - for one thing, you have to contact the object you're nailing and depress the head before you can fire the gun - it's a universal safety feature so you CANNOT shoot a nail gun like a six shooter...

4484136,5,B004VRL4BM,Saw first primeval just over a month ago. Started a little slow but got caught up in the flow and characters by the third episode. Season five continued to grow in the types of situations and emotional attachment of the characters. Wish they had been able to produce more episodes and years. There was certainly enough variety of situations that could have been developed. Any hope for a resurrection?  I would watch for sure.,1419379200,,426,4.756756756756757

4484143,5,B004VRL4BM,"Having never seen this last season of Primeval, I was overjoyed to watch it as part of my Amazon Prime subscription. I am guessing that the writers may have known that this could be the last season--they certainly left the characters in a ""good place"" and tied up most of the storylines... I realize that many years have passed since Primeval was on the air. Nevertheless, Season 5 makes it clear to THIS fan that a film or two or three would be FAN-tastic!",1417305600,,457,4.4523809523809526

It could have been handled a lot more subtlysSo as not to be the focus of each episode.  They lost me this season.  I hope, should the franchise be renewed, that they have learned from their mistakes.

As fast as science is advancing this may well happen in our future.  Look at what has happen in the last 100 years.  Anyhow, it is a very fast moving type of show that connects to each part.  Cast is outstanding and the animals are very real in their appearance.  Excellent show to watch and relax with at the end of the day.",1402358400,,448,4.285714285714286

I started with season one and was drawn into this fantastical premise of anomolies granting extinct and futuristic creatures access to our world. As I followed the show into subsequent series, I grew to appreciate the character portrayals. I felt the program really lost something when Douglas Henshall left after season three.  It took a while to warm up to the new characters, but the series still delivered fantastic situations and conspiratorial intrigue in which the future of life on this planet was at the core of the battle to find a way to stop the anomalies.  Too bad the series came to an end.",1396137600,2,651,4.752212389380531

4484290,5,B004VRL4BM,"I really enjoyed this show. I think they did a great job finishing off the series. The viewer was not left off wandering what happened. They wrapped it up and still left it open for the possibility of a movie or another season. I would totally recommend it to others. Especially those who enjoy fantasy and science fiction. I also recommend starting with the first season in order to understand where some of the characters and story lines fit in. There are several reoccurring elements and characters that are better understood when the series is followed from the beginning. The first episode of season one is a touch slow at first, but stick with it, this is an enjoyable show and worth the effort.",1358553600,,701,4.661290322580645

The departure Cutter early was an annoyance to me, but certainly not enough to stop watching. Its interesting to note that the producers rarely showed any gore, if at all, which may be a part of the BBCs style, and its refreshing  to see this type of genre series moved foreward without the need for bloody scenes.

I bought a Pioneer BDP-140 which plays them well, and they are very enjoyable with great action and CGI effects, very graphic creatures.
  If this is an oddball version of BD, why don't you tell people on the ad?  Obviously a lot of other folks have run into the same problem?  Why isn't this made clear in the description so customers don't spend hours trying to find out why they don't play?  A little effort toward this wold avoid unnecessary returns.

The 1st episode picks up one-year later. Two of the main characters are still in the Cretaceous Period, and the third (to be seen later in the series) is sill out there... six-million years ago. The 1st episode wraps things up fairly clean, and the moves on with the season's episodes, of which, several former characters are also seen later.

The series continues with its proven formula, monsters from the past & future, defeating the badguys, & saving humanity. The effects and storyline line are good, fitting the past (I recommend getting all the previous seasons', and watching them all accordingly). You can't go wrong with this BBC series.
