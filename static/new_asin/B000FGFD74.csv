8122114,1,B000FGFD74,"I thought that this movie was going to be really good. It was rated BETTER than Haggard! Needless to say, this movie was really disappointing. After reading other reviews, and seeing how well it was rated, I had high hopes for this movie. The only point in the movie that I really laughed at was a part with Ryan Dunn and Rake Yohn, and they were in the movie for an amazingly short time. I would NOT recommend this movie....AT ALL.",1156032000,3,432,4.345679012345679
8122115,5,B000FGFD74,"This is one of those great films that will have you laughing one minute (actually most of the way thru it) and shedding tears in a couple of other parts. The characters are very easy to take into your hearts as well, in fact they're so endearing they make you want to go to an AA or NA meeting even if you don't have a problem (come on people, remember admitting you have a problem is the first step toward recovery). Tweak Random (the artist formerly known as Charles ""Tweak"" Moffitt) gives an awesome and hilarious perfomance as of course Tweak in the film. Jared ""Evil Jared Hasselhoff"" Hennegan also comes acrosss as the perfect pimp ghetto santa figure as well. Ryan Dunn and Rake Yohn of televisions ""Jackass"" and ""Viva La Bam"" fame also add a lot of fun to the film as the villians Buzz and Killer. Robert Romanus from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" fame shows off his acting skills as the counselor of the halfway house as well. Brian Walsh, Chris Line, Marisa Kettering, Kelly Kunik, and Rod Sellers also are equally awesome in their roles in the film. So, take my advice and pick this film up right now!

And keep an eye out for ""A Halfway House Summer"" coming soon!

Enjoy,
