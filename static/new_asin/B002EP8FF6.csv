3919138,2,B002EP8FF6,"Chad and Scarlett are leaving their home in San Diego and heading for Seattle for a new life.  Seems the last year has been kind of rough on them, and they lost their infant son.  While driving through a remote area (apparently still California), Chad falls asleep and they run off the road, crashing their car, but luckily (ha ha) there's a nearby farm house so they walk for help.

Their hosts, Samael and Lilith, are genial and welcoming and offer to feed them and let them stay the night, promising to take them to the nearest town (30 miles away) in the morning, but they lied and subject the unwitting couple to a night of torture.  Of course, there are many attempts to get away and many attempts to kill their tormentors, who just keep on coming, even after a meat thermometer through the temple, stabbings, and running over with large vehicles.  This is one of those films that is chock full of cliches too, like ""look what you made me do"" and that kind of stuff.

There IS actually something more than meets the eye going on here, but you may well give up on the film long before that point.  I almost did.  I am a seasoned veteran of bad films though, so I'm (usually) immune to badness.  That something is somewhat of a revelation of what Chad and Scarlett seem to be running from, but the running has come to an end, and thankfully, so has the film.

Chad and Scarlett are not particularly likeable characters, and Chad snivels and cowers and mopes his way through the whole movie like a whipped puppy.  His lips and jaw rarely stop quivering.  Scarlett doesn't seem quite as pathetic, but since Chad apparently means a lot to her, well, we see that she's not so bright after all.

Steven Weber and Kelly Hu are OK as the sadistic and psychotic couple, but a little of them goes a long way too.

I will say that the twist to this ALMOST redeemed the film, but everything that comes before that is more or less the same old stuff.  And I'm pretty tired of the same old stuff.  2 out of 5.",1261785600,10,2000,4.350404312668464
3919139,4,B002EP8FF6,"This was a film I had been wanting to see for awhile and finally decided to buy the DVD.
I'm glad I did. It starts off like most torture porn movies, a couple get in an accident and seek shelter with a seemingly sweet couple in their ""Farmhouse"".All seems wonderful as the owners of the farmhouse Kelly Wu and Stephen Weber  share wine from their vineyard a meal and offer accommodations to the unlucky couple for the night.

What happens from there is surprisingly original and has some very tense nail biting moments. The ending really took me by surprise and I'm usually not a big fan of mixing the supernatural with my Slashers but in this case it really works and gives this film that extra punch that kind of knocks the wind out of you..

 The acting starts off a little shaky but it picks up and gets much better as Stephen Weber and Kelly Wu are put into the mix. It also shows what kind of damage you could do ""in a pinch"" with a Meat thermometer and a Cheese grater. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it and give it 2 big thumbs up.",1260144000,12,1040,4.237373737373737
3919140,4,B002EP8FF6,"I wasn't expecting too much with this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered Farmhouse from Amazon during a horror movie drought. All I knew about the movie was that Kelly Hu was in it. That peaked my interest because she is smoking..Anyway, the movie involves the usual stranded bickering motorists who take refuge with a hospitable if somewhat strange couple in a remote farmhouse. The story takes some tense and graphically violent turns throughout the next hour or so but veers away from its SAW and HOSTEL underpannings and ends with an unexpected and supernatural climax. All in all a nice little horror movie and a welcome addition to my collection of the macabre.",1258502400,6,680,4.870689655172414
3919141,2,B002EP8FF6,"Both torture-porn AND a morality tale (killing is BAD!) (yep, that's the message) this film becomes downright silly (complete with glowing demon eyes and a heavy-handed lesson) and throws away an intriguing premise.  Rife with hilarious dialogue (on approaching a farmhouse after a car accident a young couple has this exchange: Him: I hope someone's home.  Her:  Yeah, me too.) and acting replete with serious, slow delivery, this film can only be described as a complete time-waster.",1256688000,6,485,5.2727272727272725
3919142,5,B002EP8FF6,"It took about 5-10 minute before I started getting into the movie.  I almost shut it off.  BUT, this movie was good.  Not scary, but had some gross parts, nothing like Hostel.  The ending was good.  I just wished the torture lasted longer and was more severe.  Karma, aint it a beach.  Enjoy.",1255132800,3,292,4.39622641509434
3919143,4,B002EP8FF6,"This film started out with some promise, with fairly good production values and decent acting. I felt a little like bailing out half-way through it though, when the torture started - when the blood began to spatter. It seemed as if the film was degenerating into typical schlock shock - gratuitous gore.

But I'm glad I stuck with ""Farmhouse."" It takes a surprising U-turn, becoming more than exploitation, more than sensationalism.

You know how a couple of decades ago, starlets used to justify their on-camera nude scenes with the rote pretext that those scenes were ""integral to the movie's plot."" In this case though, the torture scenes really do turn out to be integral to the plot. And that plot turns out to be quite well-crafted. With almost old-fashioned attention to detail, all the loose ends get tied up. All the seeming little discrepancies that a viewer will probably just overlook along the way - get explained. This movie proves itself to be considerably better than the usual slap-dash slasher film being ground out.

The real shock in ""Farmhouse"" is the forewarning moral that the movie impresses the viewer with. So this is one gore-fest that you don't have to feel guilty about devoting 95 minutes of your life to watching.",1254528000,45,1244,4.886255924170616
3919144,5,B002EP8FF6,I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone but I would have never guessed were they were going with the plot. I think it was a great movie all in all,1247011200,8,148,3.65625
3919145,4,B002EP8FF6,"I had never heard of Farmhouse, and it appears no too many others have either, until I stumbled upon it and thought the premise sounded interesting. It appeared to be a revenge type suspense but turned out to be far different then anything I could have imagined. The film was written by Daniel Coughlin and directed by George Bessudo who'd previously done the laughable Lake Dead. After realizing that I figured they couldn't do much worse so maybe it'd be worth the watch.

The film starts with a young couple Chad & Scarlett who are planning to relocate after dealing with some very serious events (I don't want to give too much away). On their way Chad falls asleep at the wheel crashing the car into a telephone pole. When they awake they stumble out and come across a large house located on a beautiful wine vineyard. The couple, played by Steven Weber & Kelly Hu, welcome them in insisting that they stay for dinner and spend the night. They are more then accommodating until things take a very dark twist. Lets just say Chad and Scarlett have a very rough wake-up call that results in the worst possible outcome one would imagine.

I wanted to keep the synopsis brief because I don't want to give too much away. However you shouldn't feel too sorry for Chad and Scarlett who are exposed for their dark deeds at the end of the film. Just know that going into this film you will be dealing with more of a supernatural thriller but that won't become evident until late in the film. Overall I really enjoyed what I saw. Sure they could have done a few things better, but the film was very enjoyable for what it was. My only gripe was watching the actor Chad's facial expressions. This guy overdoes almost every expression he puts on. The other actors, especially Steven Weber, did a very good job and should be enjoyed by most horror fans.",1246924800,16,1842,4.528528528528528

3919158,5,B002EP8FF6,"This movie starts off as a run of the mill horror story with stranded couple in rural area due to car accident knocking on the door of a seemingly wholesome couple Steven Weber and Kelly Hu.  Kelly Hu is as hot as ever!  However, innocent looks are deceiving and plenty of twists due to flashbacks.  At the end, the stranded couple are more than what they appear to be.  Their own bad deeds are exposed which led me to say WHAT???!!!!  I generally do not like horror films due to random killing and gore, but this film entertained while also making me think.  And the biblical references are so subtle until everything comes full circle at the end.  I highly recommend Farmhouse.",1382400000,5,679,4.516393442622951

I had no sympathy for either lead character, and thought the whole story and script was not well done at all. The acting was mediocre at best too.

The farm is owned by Samael (Steven Weber) and Lil (Kelly Hu) short for Lilith, a dead set give away in every horror film ever made. Yawn. While at the farm, the couple has flashbacks, starting with the pregnant Scarlett being threatened by Chad's bookie.

As both scenes move forward, this turns into an abduction film with that cute and clever ending we have seen before. Had I never seen it before, the film would have maybe gotten an extra star. It makes for decent viewing, but only as a rental or maybe as part of a multi-pack.

I had heard just enough about it that I had a feeling what the ending would reveal and was mostly right..no, I'm not saying. I bought it based on reviews as I'd never heard of it, tho I am a fan of horror flicks.  Maybe because of that I'd have to say I didn't find it all that ""torturous""..LOL  I've certainly seen worse anyway.  But thats not what makes a great horror movie..a good plot does..and a ""reason"" which this one actually has both..putting it a step ahead of much crap out there.  Plus the ppl can act...course having Steven Webber in it gave me hope anyway.

3919166,1,B002EP8FF6,"What can I say? This has got to be one of the worst films ever made; except for one scene involving knees and a kitchen appliance and some decent acting from the baddies, this is truly abysmal stuff!! You know right from the start that this will be from the bottom of the barrel when you see how wonderful the acting is. There is especially one scene at the beginning when the two leads are having a chat with their neighbours, the lines and how the idiots are delivering them are beyond belief, so bad that for one second I thought I was watching a completely different genre, the only thing missing was the plumber and naked people.

 And where in the hell did they dig the male lead up from? An absolute moron running around with a constant constipated look in his face and probably living in the illusion that this is what acting is all about. If there is some sanity left in the world, this guy should never be casted again. Horrible to say the least. And don't get me started on the laughable twist-ending; truly incompetent, and it belongs in the sewer with the rest of this sad chapter of cinematic history. This film must be avoided at all costs and a worldwide protest-campaign should be launched against directors and screenwriters responsible for pestilence like this.",1325808000,6,1280,4.560869565217391

3919172,3,B002EP8FF6,"Farmhouse (2008) is a suspense thriller with a involving a couple travelling to Seattle, who run into trouble while in wine country, and seek help at a small winery.  This review will contain some spoilers, so proceed as you will.

Chad (William Lee Scott) and Scarlet (Jamie Anne Allman) are a couple who have been through a lot, and are trying to make a new start.  Chad has apparently racked up some huge gambling debts, and the couple has also recently lost their baby son.  Headed for Seattle, Chad dozes at the wheel, and whacks some telephone equipment, before crashing his SUV in a ditch.  Coming to after the crash, the couple find that their vehicle is undriveable, and that there is no cell phone service available, and head over to a nearby farm to call for help.

Passing through rows of grapes, they arrive at the home of Samael (Steven Weber) and his wife Lilith (Kelly Hu), who run the vineyard, along with a deaf helper Alal (Nick Heyman).  Chad apparently disrupted phone service to the house, as the phone is out.  The farmers graciously offer the couple dinner and a place to stay, but during the night, Chad and Scarlet are attacked and imprisoned by the farmers.  A tied up Scarlet nearly drowns after being dunked in a tub of water, and after a horrific ordeal, Scarlet and Chad manage to escape from the farm, but they can't outrun their fate.

Directed by George Bessudo (Lake Dead), Farm House is a pretty tense thriller, with some gory and sadistic moments.  Sprinkled throughout the movie are flashbacks that provide some indication that Scarlet and Chad have some dark secrets in their past.  The film takes a dramatic and unexpected turn near the end, which changes the film from a grim tale of survival, into a surrealistic free for all.  The truth isn't completely revealed, but things seem pretty clear at the end.  Some may be disillusioned when the film enters another dimension, in a development that is almost comical in its audacity.

Although the story may be suspect, the strong acting performances help make the film watchable.  Weber and Hu are often riveting, as a pair of horny psychotics.  William Lee Scott is very unlikeable as the pathetic weasel Chad.  He's not too bright, and fluctuates between being completely inept and barely competent.  Lilith calls him the biggest coward she has ever known.  Still Chad does manage to deliver an eye-rolling blow to her temple.

Jamie Ann Allman is mostly convincing in a multifaceted role, with one big exception.  However it's not her fault that the film has some major believability issues, particularly when it comes to the matter of pain and suffering.  Scarlet suffers some brutal damage to her knees that should be excruciatingly painful, and have her squirming in agony, or perhaps in shock, yet she somehow remains calm, managing to walk with very little pain, when her nerve endings should be screaming.  Chad burns his hands bad enough to peel off skin, but he is good as new, after applying some crude bandages.  Another character just stands sniveling, instead of writhing in pain, after having an eye gouged out.  In the end, there is apparently an explanation, as the events take place in an ""alternate reality"".

Some may find the twist ending an inspired deviation from the typical travelers in danger tale.  Others may be upset, and picking themselves off the floor, after the rug has been jerked from under them.  While nicely constructed and with some depth, Farmhouse is still rather a disappointment, mainly because it fails to play fair with its audience.",1302566400,,3568,4.822368421052632

It's a chilling journey down the paths of guilt and greed, played against a terrifying bucolic background.

*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!! READ ONLY IF YOU DON'T GIVE OR ALREADY WATCHED*
*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!! READ ONLY IF YOU DON'T GIVE OR ALREADY WATCHED*

1. Many times during the movie, you'll feel overly frustrated at the characters lack of judgment or act of pure stupidity and indecisiveness which leads them into more crap. Example would be the scene where he got the gun from that hot Asian chick (who is by the way too hot IMO and therefore ruins the mood of the movie, farmhouse with a hot Asian chick is questionable altogether). Anyhow, when he knocks her down with the hilt of the gun, common sense would say either one...kill her since she's a crazed psychopath obviously who tried to kill them both....or two....tie her up. Instead he leaves her unconscious, but free to roam and eventually torture his wife later on... Also, by using the shotgun, he would have realized that it was not loaded. There are tons of small examples of these. Another last example real fast before I move on is when he got the key, personally I would have just rushed in and grabbed the key, but I guess the main character had to pick the slow and dramatic and therefore idiotic approach instead.

2. Did I mention the Asian lady is too hott? I feel that her main objective is eye candy IMO. Farmhouse and a hot young Asian woman just does not mix, I would have been suspicious to begin with.

3. Bizarre ending, I know it was meant to deliver a twist, but wow was it too much to take.

4. The torture scenes are pathetic. To be truthful, there are only two torture scenes really. One relating to his wife and getting drowned and the other his wife again getting diced in the knee area. Not really horrific, especially the drowning scene. Sorry, but it was weak and the story was too bizarre.

5. The cowardly man, sorry be he is an extremely hate-able character. I had to major urge to smack him around, especially relating to reason number 1. I don't know how a woman would ever stay with a guy like that, it's just ridiculous. Most of your frustration will probably go to him.

Overall, this movie is watchable but it does not in no shape or form deserve 4 stars, but then again most people don't know a good thing from a bad thing.",1282176000,3,2290,4.451073985680191

Farm House gradually grabbed me and I couldn't stop watching until the end. The story and especially the performances were all A plus, thanks to the brilliant direction of George Bessudo. I won't give away the truly surprising ending that proves to be a shocker, sufficie it to say you'll be amply rewarded.

 There was one actor who was so electrifying that I want to start a fan club for him. William Lee Scott portray the tragic young husband and although very masculine, his character is so fragile and sad that I nearly cried everytime he did. His little boy's face was so poignant and doomed that it was totally spellbinding.

Just watch William Lee Scott and tell me that you agree. Where has this great young actor been all my life? I am now one of his most faithful fans.

George Bessudo proves with ""Farm House"" that you don't need a multi-million dollar budget and state-of-the-art special effects to capture the attention of the viewer.

With movies such as ""Hostel"", ""Saw"" and ""Turistas"" already available on the market, it's usually pretty easy to pass on torture flicks.  The assumption that all of these films are the same may make many potential viewers turn away from considering Farmhouse.  However, given the opportunity to view the film, I'm sure that they will quickly have a change of heart in regards to this film.

The story focuses on a couple who lives in San Diego.  Chad and Scarlett are husband and wife venturing to start their lives anew in Seattle, Washington.  They depart from San Diego after leaving all of their belongings to some friends and begin to head towards their destination.  The reason for their sudden departure?  Chad was recently involved with ""loan sharks"" and out of desperation the couple believes that moving far away will protect them from further harm from these ""gangsters"".  Previous encounters with the ""debt collectors"" ended with violence, one encounter even leaving the pregnant Scarlett on the floor.  As a result of the fall, Scarlett's baby is born with a disability (possibly Epilepsy) and faces seizures constantly.  The audience knows that somehow the child has died, but the details aren't explained as of yet.  The sudden death of the child had such an impact on the couple that it contributed as yet another reason why Chad and Scarlett decide to start their lives all over again.

Slowly after their departure, however, Chad falls asleep at the wheel during their drive to Seattle and the two of them are forced to seek shelter in a small farmhouse along the highway.  They are taken in by a friendly couple who offers to help them locate a body shop in the morning and allow the traveling couple to stay the night.  Looks can be deceiving, however, as the once friendly couple begins to slowly show their true selves.  What unravels next is sure to shock the non-expecting audience.  Brutal torture on various degrees occurs, as Chad and Scarlett begin to fight for their lives.  The audience is left watching scenes of body mutilation and watch in horror as the couple meets more agony at every turn.

Just as things start to look up for the couple, the audience is greeted with a surprise twist regarding their exact location and why the two people are being tortured in the first place.  The film plays itself as a justified torture flick with a moral to tell, showing the viewer why it's important to live a better life and just how evil greed truly is.  With a great plot that is revealed slowly through flashbacks, the audience gains deeper insight on the past actions of Chad and Scarlett.  Couple this with great acting, amazing lighting, and shocking scenes and you'd truly be out of your mind to pass this one up.  A great film to add to any horror collection, and one that may change your perception on the torture sub-genre.",1263168000,49,2943,4.7727272727272725
