8340515,5,B001T4Y1BK,"A delightful experience - Volunteers for Verdi

Glendale, California. June 16, 2011

This morning at breakfast our activity director announced that
a  documentary movie would be shown at 10am. We had little
knowledge about it, so we asked, what is the subject matter?

The answer, quickly given, was its about singing and seniors.

We went upstairs and met Mr. Pike who is the son of my neighbor
at Glendale Emeritus. He told us the story that he intercepted 52
hours of video of folks from St. Peters Church after several years
work on the project.

At the time he took it over the project had been completed but
film work was at a standstill. Mr. Pike explained he had to create
a timeline of the entire film library, while indexing and labelling
each scene and writing out the dialog. When this was done
it became his task to select the scenes which are shown in the
film and that took some very good editing talents.

The film flows nicely, it is interesting, and it never drags on like
many documentaries we have seen. The outstanding highlights
are the expressions, nuances, and personal idiosyncracies of
the dedicated players who made the production of Verdi's
Opera Don Carlo come to life.

You will have to take the time to view this film and render an
opinion. In mine, it was excellent entertainment about the
wonderful mix of backgrounds and talents of local Los Angelinos
who lived near my neighborhood in silverlake.
