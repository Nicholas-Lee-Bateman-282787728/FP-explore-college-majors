8191359,5,8015241693,"I really like the older Veggie Tales movies.  The new ones have gotten off track in their core message.  Now, instead of being about serving God, it's more about ""being good"" or ""moral"".  While the morality message is fine, the faith in Christ message is FAR more important.  So glad these older ones are still around.  Great way to introduce God and His love for those who serve Him to kids!",1354492800,,392,4.464788732394366
8191360,3,8015241693,My son loves veggie tales and we have movies in both english and spanish. The only thing I was unsatisfied with is that in each of the spanish veggie tales they use different people for the voices of the characters so in each movie the characters sound differnt. Even my 2 year old son recognized this. Other than that the movie itself was very cute and a good show for my son to watch with catchy songs.,1331856000,,404,4.259740259740259
