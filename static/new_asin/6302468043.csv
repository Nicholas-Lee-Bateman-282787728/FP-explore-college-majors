7826412,5,6302468043,"A good looking blonde in a 1957 Thunderbird is always appealing, especially when cruising the roads around Griffith Park in
Los Angeles in the '50s.  Add another beautiful woman in a Cadillac convertible and you have the makings of a good Saturday
night movie.  Switching other cars for the guy's car wrecks is also a delight in detective observation, with the '56 Ford
morphing into something else when it goes off the cliff after the sideswipe.  The bad girl blonde in this movie has a way of
getting what she wants from the lead man, or she will rat him out for whatever (driving with no license, in one instance).
Bruno VeSoto plays a very solid villain and Sandra Giles is dynamite as the vixen blonde with the T-Bird, a star in its own
right.  The henchman in this movie has the required muscle, but also has a weakness, which makes him human.",1369699200,,849,4.529411764705882
7826413,4,6302468043,"While never reaching the awesomely ludicrous heights of Girls' Town or High School Confidential, due primarily to a lesser cast, Daddy-O still delivers the campy-JD-tight- sweater-wearing goods. On occasion, it even works on a slight, legitimate level.
Dick Contino stars as Daddy-O, a.k.a. Phil Sandifer, a.k.a. Pete Plum. He was a 50's musician of some renown. In my estimation, he was one of luckiest guys in the world, as he married Leigh (Creature Walks Among Us, Hot Rod Rumble) Snowden. Contino was sort of a Stallone/Elvis cross, with a smidgen of Cosmo Kramer in the mix. If that doesn't give you a mental picture, think of him as a less-revered Fonzie, only leading a rockabilly band and wearing striped polo shirts. In this movie he likes singin', draggin', and wearin' his trousers hiked up to his third rib.
He doesn't particularly like the statuesque blonde (Sandra Giles- like wow, man, and I'm not talking about her acting ability) who keeps cutting him off in her hot rod. But he begins to dig her more after he learns it wasn't she that forced his friend off the road to his death. Still, they quarrel a lot until the end, when the script calls for them to love each other.
After some illegal (25 m.p.h.) drag racing costs Contino his license and his truck-driving job, he is approached with an employment offer by Sidney Greenstreet, as portrayed by Corman veteran Bruno VeSota. VeSota (Yvette Vickers' husband in Attack of the Giant Leeches) is a shady but polite fat man who owns a club called The High Note, and he sees everything he's looking for in Contino: he sings, he drives, he bends the law... VeSota hopes all the 30-year old teens in town will come there to wiggle in tune with rock 'n' roll and demurely sip sodas, covering up his illegal operations. Contino agrees, in order to find out more about his friend's death and the small matter of ""5,000 missing skins."" He takes the stage name Daddy-O, enabling him to sing out laughable ditties such as Rock Candy Baby. He is also provided with a fake driver's license in order to make some secret, late-night deliveries, maybe involving drugs from Mexico.
Eventually, after some escapes from the cops and a beating by thugs seemingly inserted into the plot at random, Contino does learn that VeSota was in fact responsible for his buddy's untimely demise. So he sets out to nail VeSota and his henchman, a beefy but nearly-blind gym manager, all without further violating the terms of his parole! Will he be able to do it? The finale is a not-bad affair, as VeSota, armed with a pistol, seeks Daddy-O in a dark wine cellar.
This is not exactly Rebel Without a Cause here, as you may have gathered. But for lovers of camp, the era, and/or the movies mentioned earlier, this is a safe bet for fun, repeated viewings.
And here's the topper: the music was done by John (Star Wars) Williams!
