I'm afraid America will never have this kind of work ethic, inventiveness, and use our natural resources to advance the worlds technology and productivity. Today our country founders because of overreaching regulatory bureaucrats who have found reasons to not do great things. I don't like being an a American't rather than an a American. This documentary shows people how America wasn't afraid of letting a cave dwelling fish go extinct so that a natural resource could be used to build something to advance America. Today's over protective Nanny state just gives us reasons and laws not to even try to remain independent and use all our natural resources for the good of the people of our country and the world. All the digital advancements require use of natural resources just like the brick and mortar inventions shown in this documentary. I sure hope we don't come to a point where hard work, really hard work, is required to save our country because today's workforce couldn't do the really hard work necessary to harvest and use our natural resources and produce a product that might endanger a three toed butterfly that comes around every three decades. Darwin figured out natural selection and speciation a long time ago and Darwin's theories and observations are correct.",1497657600,,1315,5.0091324200913245
