7271178,3,B00Z710U7K,"The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe is a Lifetime feature starring Kelli Garner as the famous actress. Based on the book by Randy Taraborelli, the film follows typical biopic format in chronicling the key events in Monroes life. Fictional psychiatrist Alan DeShields (Jack Noseworthy) serves as the latest doctor/hand holder to the insecure actress. Monroes mother, Gladys Mortensen (Susan Sarandon), is depicted as a religious zealot highly critical of her daughter and her choices. Monroes marriages to Joe DiMaggio (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and author Arthur Miller (Stephen Bogaert) are covered. The Monroe/JFK relationship also gets some screen time.

There are many movies out there about this iconic actress, but Ms. Garners relative unfamiliarity and resemblance to Monroe allow for a welcome suspension of disbelief as Garner immerses herself in the role. The picture traces Monroes growing popularity, her rise from supporting player to megastar, and her ongoing insecurity, which manifests itself in lateness to the set, countless takes, and a touching shyness despite her fame. Ms. Garner strikes the occasional familiar Monroe pose, but concentrates less on imitation, more on characterization. Stephen Kronishs screenplay has a Dickensian feel with Monroes unhappy childhood and her mothers mental illness acting as impediments to a fulfilling life.

Ms. Sarandon does a good job balancing her portrayal of Gladys, playing her in shades of grey. This is a woman who firmly believes that her often stifling decisions are made in the best interest of her impressionable daughter. By humanizing Gladys, we get to see that her own neuroses were likely passed on  in altered form  to Marilyn. The picture shows how Monroe struggles to maintain her career while battling her own inner demons and attempting to improve herself as an actress, please studio heads, and maintain her popularity.

At three hours, the mini-series has its bloated moments but, overall, is an entertaining look into the human being beneath the movie star. There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1440115200,13,2080,5.368098159509202

7271196,5,B00Z710U7K,"Landing upon a commercial while surfing the cable channels is how I became aware of this movie. Being another MM fan I decided to watch it to check for accuracy. To all out there, it is accurate to the best of my knowledge although, some details of events could have been expanded a bit

Ms. Kelli Garner made a magnificent performance portraying Marilyn, a smart, determined young woman who desired to be truly loved and wanted, with her own personal problems and a life which seemed a ""dark cloud"" followed her around constantly. Despite all this she endured to the end never giving up on herself. A movie worth seeing. Makes one desire to pursue learning of her even more.",1470873600,2,675,4.625

7271208,5,B00Z710U7K,"'The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe' stars Kelli Garner as sex symbol of the 1950s, Marilyn Monroe. Garner's portrayal is golden in this two part Lifetime Mini-series. The film also stars Susan Sarandon as Monroe's mentally disturbed mother. If I could give this film more stars I would! It's certainly worth the purchase!!",1452470400,7,322,5.09433962264151
7271209,5,B00Z710U7K,"Well done and well acted by all. The attention for detail is definitely there and Kelli Garner did a really great job with the portrayal of the blonde legend. Susan Sarandon's talent is wasted as Gladys Monroe. It was too small off a part and even though she is great as always, she doesn't provide enough screen time to warrant her presence.",1447718400,6,342,4.532258064516129

7271212,5,B00Z710U7K,"Worth every penny.

I didn't think it'd be good since it's a lifetime tv biopic but this one should not be missed. As a Marilyn Monroe fan , I enjoyed this very much.",1443139200,2,166,4.03030303030303
7271213,5,B00Z710U7K,I am a little biased as my son Giacomo Gianniotti is starring in it as Marilyn's first husband . They are all superb . Marilyn played of course a challenging role and did amazingly well.,1443052800,4,186,4.3428571428571425

7271217,5,B00Z710U7K,"I have been a fan of Marilyn's since 1982. With that said, I have read many books and have seen all her movies and the movies made about her life. I have to say none of them have impressed me until now. This movie pulled me right in and truly touched me as a fan. There were times I forgot I wasn't watching Marilyn on screen. It was a great story with some truly exceptional performances. I have to say Susan Sarandon performance of Gladys Baker truly changed my opinion of the woman. After reading Bernice Bakers book ""my sister Marilyn"" I was sick of Gladys but thanks to Susan performance, she put it all in perspective. A great movie for Marilyn fans",1441238400,9,655,4.333333333333333

8719555,4,B00Z710U7K,"This gives a good idea of what Marilyn Monroe had to face in her life. Unfortunately, she inherited her mothers paranoia. I was in touch with her family in North Carolina and they believe she had an accidental overdose. She was forgetting how many pills she had taken. She overdosed the day after the costume and makeup tests for Somethings Got to Give. Her psychiatrist brought her back to life like it was something that has happened before. According to the family, Marilyn was going to marry Joe DiMaggio on August 8, 1962, the day of her funeral. Joe never married again and never got over Marilyn. His last words when he died were that he was going to see Marilyn again.",1522281600,,676,4.549180327868853

8719562,4,B00Z710U7K,"In a Canadian production, Marilyn Monroe is depicted as a constantly sighing, ambitious trollop, mentally ill like her mother, who screws her way to the top in the movie business.
In one revealing scene (which acts as a motif), the camera is tilted at such an angle to make a naked Marilyn look like a snake swimming in a pool.
There's a bit more depth to it than that, but most of the characters are implicitly loathsome.
I would much rather see Marilyn depicted in a more sympathetic light, but it's well made and competently acted.",1501200000,,534,4.572916666666667
