7479134,5,B016PGEUJY,"Kelly Coffey Meyer is one of the few instructors I will place a pre-order with, and probably the only one where that happens on a regular basis.  I really like trying all of her workouts, although I don't keep them all.  I keep my favorites and it's suprising to me how many of her DVDs I feel are a favorite.  I think this one will become one of those in the long term.

Over time, I've seen multiple people ask for a Circuit Burn 2.  This DVD has similar workouts, but it is also different from Circuit Burn in some ways.  I like them both and feel that both have a place in my DVD collection, especially with me wanting to do more metabolic type workouts these days.

Just like all of the other 30 Minutes to Fitness DVDs, Lean Body Circuits contains two 30-minute workouts that combine cardio and strength and a bunch of premixes.  Each workout is comprised of 4 circuits and each circuit has 4 components: hi-lo, boxing, lower body strength and upper body strength  in that order. Each component lasts for a minute. She urges you to use heavy weights on the strength work.  I started out with 5 pounds (my usual in thepast months - alhtough I'm trying to increase my strength) and then I went to 8 and now I'm thinking about using 10 the next time I do one of these workouts.  The crew each has one set of dumbbells ranging from 15-25 pounds. As usual, there is a modifier and she does a good job of giving lower intensity/impact options without looking like she's dialing it in.

One of my favorite parts of this DVD series are the premixes.  Some DVDs include a lot of premixes I can use; others not so many.  As with Circuit Burn, I think this DVD has a good number that I will use and enjoy.  The premixes for this DVD include:

> Combined Workouts - 52 Minutes
> Lean Body Weights - 27 Minutes
> Lean Body Cardio - 33 Minutes
> Lean Body Hi-Lo - 20 Minutes
> Lean Body Boxing - 20 Minutes
> Lean Body Legs - 17 Minutes
> Lean Upper Body - 18 Minutes
> Combined (No Hi-Lo) - 39 Minutes
> Combined (No Boxing) - 39 Minutes
> Combined (No Upper Body) - 42 Minutes
> Hi-Lo and Legs - 30 Minutes
> Boxing and Legs - 30 Minutes
> HI Lo and Upper Body - 30 Minutes
> Boxing and Upper Body - 31 Minutes",1433980800,38,2204,4.13849765258216

7479142,5,B016PGEUJY,"I love this because it's a BODY WEIGHT workout, you don't need any free weights, or any equipment for it. It's great for business travelers who don't always have access to equipment. It's a low impact workout, there's no jumping around, but the movements are big so you still get a quality workout. It's split into two workouts: the first is a standing workout which utilizes lots of squats: big movements so you'll definitely feel it. The second is a floor workout with lots of pushups, don't be afraid tho, the pushups are modified to be easier that a standard military pushup, but still give a really great workout.",1368662400,9,618,4.678899082568807

7479145,5,B016PGEUJY,"I love this workout! This is my second Kelly's dvd and I lost so many pounds, I love the premixes options , I do the  combined routine for a total of 52 minutes, I love her style and the exercises are easy to learn but though . I only use 10 to 15 pounds weights but I still get a very good workout. I used to do Jillian Michaels but not my style anymore except for one or two dvd's she goes to fast for me and I need to watch her several times to learn the moves, and I don't feel the burn like in this one. Cathe is another of my favorites but she is really tough and I don't think I am at that advanced level yet so I do it just one per week. I exercise 4 times per week 50 to 60 min. Thank you Kelly for helping achieve my weight loss!",1514419200,,739,3.7070063694267517

7479148,3,B016PGEUJY,"Six workouts, 15 minutes each. I liked the first four only. Cardio Bootcamp was fast-paced (Ex. 2 slow speed skaters, then 4 fast, repeat). The Kickboxing uses light weights and there's lots of punches and jabs that are more interesting than the norm. The Cardio Sculpt and the Lower Body are also good and kept me interested. The last two were a stumble. Upper Body uses weights; 10 reps repeated 3 times throughout the 15 minutes. Yeah, kinda repetitive but the worst was the yoga. It must've been an after-thought because it had the same dull, snooze-inducing moves ( Warrior, Downward Dog) I've seen forever. And even worse? She repeats the cycle SIX (or was it seven?) times!!!

7479154,4,B016PGEUJY,"In the past year or so I have really gotten into Kelly Coffey-Meyer workouts. She is tough and gets me sweating, but also keeps it interesting and who can't find 30 minutes to work out? I'm used to 90 minute workouts, so these dvds fly by which is awesome. I really like body design. The kick boxing with weights is my favorite workout. I really like the premixes, I do wish that you could build your own mix that would play continuously instead of it taking you back to the menu. My least favorite section is the yoga portion because it is very repetitive, but it does give me a good stretch after the other sections. Overall I would recommend this dvd, other than the yoga portion, you won't get bored and I appreciate the use of heavy weights.",1498176000,,746,4.374100719424461
7479155,3,B016PGEUJY,"I love Kelly's workout dvds and own about 12 or so of them. Sadly, this has turned out to be one of my least favorites. I don't know if it has to do with the fact that each segment is shorter (approx 15 minutes) but they seem rushed, especially the two cardio and the yoga. Yoga shouldn't be rushed thru, not to mention it's really repetitive. There are a LOT of squats and lunges so if I do the cardio bootcamp and the leg workout my poor knees are very sad. Like I said, I typically love Kelly's workouts and this might be perfect for someone else but I'll stick with all my other Kelly dvds.",1497398400,,594,4.129310344827586
7479156,4,B016PGEUJY,"NOTE:  This review is for CARDIO PUMP, although this might not display correctly on Amazon's listing.

I'm a big fan of Kelly's (she's from my hometown!), and although I haven't clicked with every single one of her workouts, I love her overall style.  I have particularly enjoyed her kickboxing/boxing workouts, so I was mainly interested in Cardio Pump for that reason, although I wound up liking the weight portion better; more on that shortly.

Like all of the workouts in Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Cardio Pump offers to main workouts of about 30 minutes in length plus various premixes made up of segments from the primary routines.  The Main Menu includes Introduction - Workout One - Workout Two - Premixes - Credits.  In both routines, Kelly teaches live to very upbeat music.  She is in a modern studio (borrowed from Cathe) with a large group of seven background exercisers, including the return of Lauren showing modifications.  I actually did not like this larger group, as they seemed very bunched together, and it was hard to see any one individual person, including the modifier.

Both workouts include the same 4-minute warm-up as part of their total time.  The warm-up moves are as follows: alternating overhead reaches  tempo jabs  hooks  uppercuts  forward folds/shoulder rolls  shuffles/jogs/jacks.

***WORKOUT ONE***

The first workout is the cardio boxing routine, and it's 30 minutes long.  One of the things I have loved about Kelly's prior boxing choreography is that she has made it intense and interesting yet remaining low-impact and easy-to-follow.  While the sequences here are still low impact, I found that they had a more difficult learning curve, in part because Kelly seemed to string more moves together.  Some of the combos just seemed to have too much going on, especially #2 (see below).

Combo #1:
*To one side:  jab-cross-hook-up  add shin block/double jab w/slip
*After first side, jabs front and then switch sides
Combo #2:
*Double jabs-single jabs  squat x3/click heels  body shot/upper cut  elbow smash/clear (side elbow)  finish with series of elbow smashes only
Combo #3:
*To one side:  shuffle-knee/jab-cross x8  uppercut x4/speedbag x8
*Hip shift to Side 2 and repeat, moving from side to side
Combo #4
*Uppercut-hook x2  bob out to one side/jack x2  twisting bob & weave in center  switch sides back & forth  add step front jab-cross x2 after jack on each side
Combo #5
*Jump rope x8/jack x4  stomp to alternating sides/add triple hook to stomp  alternating step back/add alternating jabs front x6  repeat several times
Combo #6
*In-out step/add hi-low hook on out step x2  stay out for double jab hold  add punch down x2/quarter turn  repeat, alternating sides

***WORKOUT TWO***

The second workout is Pump, which comes in at 33 minutes.  Pump is designed as a pyramid-style workout, which means that one body part is worked out using three different sets of weights, starting with the heaviest and moving to a progressively lower weight.  Unlike a traditional pyramid workout, Kelly does not do the same move for all three sets; instead, she targets the body part with three complementary exercises.  Kelly usually states the poundage of the weights that she is using but encourages viewers to lift and the level that is appropriate for the individual.  As noted above, the warm-up is the same as in the first workout.  The remaining exercises are listed below.

Shoulders:
*Alternating push press overhead
*Upright rows
*Alternating lateral raise
Biceps:
*Alternating supinated front curls
*Hammer curls
*Alternating side curls
Legs:
*Deadlifts
*Sumo squats, alternating sides
*Alternating reverse lunges
Back:
*Alternating lawnmowers
*Squeeze backs (reverse flys)
*Run rows
Triceps:
*Overhead tricep extension
*Single-arm alternating kickbacks
*Triceps push-ups
Legs:
*Squats
*Alternating front lunges
*Plies
Chest:
*Chest press
*Flys
*Running alternating wide chest press
2-minute standing stretch (shoulders, Figure 4, body circle)

These are the premixes directly as listed off the premix menu.  The cardio premixes include ALL of the cardio combos.

PREMIXES (all include a Warm-Up and a Cool-Down)
*Interval Pump 53
*Cardio Leg Pump 38
*Cardio Shoulders & Arms 41
*Cardio Back & Chest 38
*Pump Shoulders & Arms 18
*Pump Back & Chest 15

Overall, I did like this DVD, although there were a few disappointments.  As I said, I wish that the boxing combos had been a bit easier to follow (and even better, I would have preferred kickboxing sequences, but I knew I wasn't getting that).  I also would have loved a couple of shorter cardio premixes--e.g., one that offered Combos 1-3 and another that included Combos 4-6.  Still, I'm glad to have this addition to my Kelly collection and am looking forward to experimenting with it more.  My final rating would probably be just over 4 stars--I'd give this one about a 4.25 if I could.",1496534400,,4899,5.132911392405063
7479157,5,B016PGEUJY,One of my favorite KCM workouts. The premixes are always a bonus. I like her add on style of teaching.

7479161,4,B016PGEUJY,"My wife purchased this and she loves the part of the DVD where they mix and match the workouts for you.  She has done the workouts as is, but has gone back to the section of the DVD where they break the workout into different focused sections (for your abs, cardio, focused on highs and lows, etc.) more than just doing the regular workouts.  This was her first video with Kelly Coffey-Meyer and she liked how normal she seemed, with a very relatable group of people working out with her.",1495152000,2,488,4.411111111111111

It was a tad easy and didn't keep my interest.  I am at an advanced level so that's perhaps why.  I highly recommend this for beginners and intermediate level only. It's relatively low impact and what I would consider warm up level for advanced. I like the 15 min. segments which give you more control and variety to your workout routine.  Kelly has a wonderful personality so this is a great dvd for individuals just starting out or those looking for a less intense workout.",1493251200,5,606,4.375

7479165,5,B016PGEUJY,"I have a lot of Kelly C-M videos and I really like them.  This one has the cardio workout and the weight workout and then the pre-mixes to keep in interesting after you've done the work out several times.  It is the same warm up for both workouts and she used to do separate warm ups for each workout, but other than that it is a good workout with the options for upping the level included like always.  She throws in a few (a very few) slightly more dance-like steps but I didn't feel that took away from the serious athletic-feel of the video; just added variety.",1485302400,3,565,4.261682242990654

This is my 8th workout dvd I've bought and I'll probably order a couple more  I love this workout dvd because it has one cardio workout and weight training workout.  The weight training workout is cool because she has you use three sets of weights from light to heaviest and each set of exercises rotates through the weight sets. The kickboxing workout is very fast paced and I thought I was prepared since I've done Taebo, I was wrong.  I was all over the place, but at least I was still moving.

I was looking for a DVD that would give me a good cardio workout (without being too dancy) AND uses free weights during strength training.  This workout fits the bill.  I especially love the premixes which are a blend of her cardio portion, upper body segments and lower body segments.  This morning, I did the lower body premix for the first time.  I love the kickboxing portion of the cardio.  Not too difficult if you're familiar.  Coffey-Meyer gives good, clear instructions and repeats enough without it getting too repetitive.  She also gets me stoked with her enthusiasm. The only reason I didn't give this workout 5 stars is because the music is too low for my tastes.  I get that we need to hear her, but I'll soon know the routine and I'll want to hear the music more.",1471219200,3,827,4.571428571428571
7479174,5,B016PGEUJY,"I have been a Jillian Michael's fan since I lost my baby weight from my first child with her 30DS. I have almost all of Jillian's DVDs and have depended on them for years to stay in shape. After my second child I had a shoulder injury that tends to cause chronic tendon pain in my shoulder, neck and back. It prevents me from doing the more jarring plank-type movements that Jillian really relies on to up the intensity in her workouts. This left me doing only her less intense level 1 workouts or modifying her workouts so often that it felt it was not even really worth it to turn them on.

Jillian's workouts involve a LOT of burpees, mountain climbers, plank jacks etc. and they were leaving me in pain. I struggled to find something equally intense that doesn't incorporate those now *popular* moves that so many instructors rely on. This was the perfect solution! While she does incorporate some plank moves, they are minimal and they mostly involve slow strength building movements rather than jarring and jumpy movements. She also has a modifier that you can watch if you want to skip the move altogether and stay on your feet. I felt that even if I skipped those few moves I still would get a really great workout overall because she doesn't rely on them for the whole workout.

Now that I've had my third child I really need a good workout to get back on track. With this workout I found myself sweating hard and really feeling great! Another thing that surprised me was that I enjoyed the fact that she adds a little more choreography, which keeps my mind interested. Her combinations of punches and footwork are not super hard to master, but they keep you thinking and counting. Jillian's workouts just repeat a simple move for 30 seconds like butt kicks or jacks, which can leave you just wishing away the time. This really kept me more entertained!

Her teaching style is straightforward and strong. She encourages heavy weights, which I think is progressive and exciting to try. Overall I found this to be a really refreshing change from what I am used to. I love that I can still workout hard without aggravating my tendons. Great DVD! I will definitely be checking out more of her workouts soon, but all the premixes on this DVD will keep me satisfied with this one for quite awhile!

7479189,4,B016PGEUJY,"I love it! The first time I did this dvd I did the premix combining the two workouts, so 52min alternating 2 cardio (mainly kickboxing) with 2 strength exercises. Each exercise lasts 1 minute. Perhaps it was also the music that made me enjoy it so much. With KCM the music seems to be a hit or miss for me. On all my Cathe dvd's I've enjoyed the music and I really need the music to be good for me to have fun with a workout.

It's a pretty good burn for me,  507kcal in less than an hour and that despite the fact that I have just been sick so I was probably not giving it my all.",1455580800,3,581,3.8739495798319328

After a month of nearly only Cathe w/o's KCM just didn't really cut it for me with this w/o. It wasn't a bad w/o, it just didn't have the same fun factor as the Cathe w/o's.

I will edit this review once I have done the other w/o on the dvd or a premix.",1455580800,2,372,3.8947368421052633
7479191,5,B016PGEUJY,I have all of the 30 minutes to fitness series and this one is fantastic as usual.  I like to do legs and upper body on seperate days and I can do that with the premixes.  I like that I can combine cardio with strength as well.  My heart rate really gets up there with this workout.,1455321600,2,282,3.912280701754386
7479192,4,B016PGEUJY,"This is the first video by Kelly Coffey-Meyer I bought.  Ive seen her videos available on Amazon, but they were always more expensive than the others I end up buying over the years.  That is why I was so happy to see this video on pre-sale for almost half the price.  I could not resist.  I have worked out on and off for 20 years (Im in my early 40s).  2 Months ago I looked at myself and said I am not going down like this!  I started back to working out.  I have lost 15 pounds.  I have access to a lot of exercise videos.  Between the videos I own and the videos at the local library I have done over 215 exercise videos (Jessica Smith, Exhale Core Fusion, Shape, the Firm, Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, Rodney Yee, Element, 10 Minute Solution, Jennifer Galardi, Tracey Mallett, Jari Love, Violet Zaki, Ana Caban, and Gilad to name my favorites).  So you could probably ask me to compare this video to pretty much anything that is on the market, except the ones from Beach Body like PX90, and I could give you an answer from experience.  There are things I like about this video, and it will be in my rotation, but not the first one I reach for.  Here is why

The kickboxing workout (Workout 1) was a good basic routine.  I like it the best of the two workouts.  It was not difficult to pick up the first time I did it.  There were a few new moves, but the combinations were 90% the basic moves you can get anywhere  jab, cross, uppercut, hook.  However, the routine was something new so I enjoyed it.  I also like that there were cardio intervals (like jumping rope and jumping jacks).  There was no kicking or lower body, except a knee, which could be a downside for someone looking for a routine that works your whole body. I would give it 5 stars for a cardio kickboxing work out on arm days and 3 stars for overall.  According to my heart rate Fit Bit, I was 74% Cardio, had 3 peak minutes, and burned 274 calories.

The pump part of the Cardio Pump (Workout 2) is a 2 star work out compared to other recent releases.  I liked doing the pyramid style of weight training (3 sets of weights high to low), but doing one exercise at a time seems too old school to me.  The videos I do now are cardio sculpt that involve complex moves incorporating multiple body parts so you can do the most effective workout in the shortest amount of time and get more ab and balance work.  Plus, you are always moving so your burn even more calories.  Not so in this video.  In this workout you hit only the big muscles of the legs, arms, chest, and back, and you do the body parts one at a time.  Another missing piece is there is no separate ab work.  You work to fatigue with the pyramid style (working down from large to small weights), so if lifting weights is your goal, you might like this video. On the other hand, I have data to back me up that this workout is not the most effective use of my time as burning calories to lose weight is my goal.  According to my heart rate Fit Bit, I was 80% in the fat burn zone,  and burned 153 calories to Workout 2.  When I compare that to my recent cardio sculpt Jessica Smith routine from Look Good Naked, I was 77% in the cardio zone, and burned 307 calories in the same amount of time, and my muscles felt more of a workout.  No contest.

Was it worth the $12 I paid? Yes, it was for the kickboxing.  There are also pre mixes that combine the pump and the cardio workouts in different ways that are more effective than the pump alone.  You do cardio for a while and then stop to do certain pump parts of the video, depending on the premix. Then, you get back into cardio.  The premixes are why I gave the video 4 instead of 3 stars.  Doing the premixes burns more calories than the pump part alone.  I still can't believe there is no separate abs.  Would it be worth it to me at $20, no. Also, I would only buy Ms. Coffey-Meyer's other videos, if they had kickboxing and were on sale.  If you enjoy Kelly Coffey-Meyers style, I think you will be happy with this video, as my research into her videos shows this is consistently her program of workout.  If you are new to her videos like me, I am not so sure.  She has a great body, so she is obviously doing a lot right.  I just think I can get more out of my other exercise videos as shown by my calories burned on my Fit Bit.",1453507200,4,4317,4.155609167671894
7479193,5,B016PGEUJY,Nothing less than what I've come to expect from Coffeyfit. Challenging but not un-doable; moves quickly enough that you don't get bored; and is effective.,1453420800,4,154,5.2
7479194,5,B016PGEUJY,"this dvd is a great value because you get 2 complete 30 minute workouts and 7 premix complete workouts. The music on this dvd is great! The format of the 2 main workouts are circuits of a minute each of cardio, boxing, lower body weight, upper body weight. There are 4 of these circuits; none are repeated. She uses 20 lb Dumbbells. I used 12 lb and it's a great workout in 30 minutes. I love the music in this one!",1453075200,2,415,4.135802469135802
7479195,5,B016PGEUJY,This is a revised review.  I previously gave this a 3 star review and said it did not click with me.  I thought it was not challenging enough weight wise and the boxing was too complex in chorographically.  I challenged myself with 12 pound weights and really focused on the boxing.  Now I love it!  The boxing sections really work your core and the music is cheesy but fun!,1450137600,8,374,4.36231884057971
7479196,5,B016PGEUJY,"Kelly's workouts are my favorite. 30 minutes and done! A little boxing, a little cardio, a little weight lifting and I'm done!

7479203,5,B016PGEUJY,"I had a really bad fitness year last year. Now, I am working on coming back and I am currently focusing on metabolic workouts.  My personal definition of a metabolic workout is one that mixes cardio and strength and that leaves me a sweaty mess.  ""But wait,"" you say, ""Cardio Pump is comprised of two 30-ish-minute workouts, one a strength training workout done pyramid style and the other one a boxing workout (aka, cardio workout)."" That is true and they are both excellent stand-alone workouts.  But, I have one word for you - premixes!  As usual, Kelly includes premixes on this DVD that greatly extend the value of the DVD.  And I'm having a blast exploring their options after having done each of the stand-alone workouts once each.  Here is the list of premixes on this DVD:

Interval Pump - 53 Minutes
Cardio Leg Pump - 38 Minutes
Cardio Shoulder & Arms - 41 Minutes
Pump Shoulder & Arms - 18 Minutes
Pump Back & Chest - 38 minutes
Cardio Back & Chest - 38 Minutes

The Pump workout is a total-body strength workout done pyramid style.  By this designation, Kellly means that you do an exercise for a body part with the heaviest weight, then you do another exercise for the same body part with the medium weight, and then you end that section for that body part with a move using the lightest weight.  Each exercise is done for around 1 minute. When you're done with that, you move on to the next body part and start the process over with your heaviest weight. No exercise is repeated, which I really like because I find repeating moves to induce boredom sometimes.  Kelly uses 20, 15 and 10 pound weights. I, in all my unfit glory, used 5, 8, and 10 pounds and considered that I could go a bit heavier in the future.  People who know strength training will tell you that this is not true pyramid strength training - and they're right.  But, I don't care - I think this is an excellent workout whatever you want to call it and found that the time just flew.

The cardio workout is boxing, rather than kickboxing. Kelly builds 6 combos. The combos are varied and bring in some leg work.  I found them varied and complex enough to keep things interesting and fun, but not complex or difficult to follow.  And, there were some moves that seemed very un-Kelly-like (but fun!).  For example, there's one combination where she has you switch sides of the body by swinging your hips around.  Overall, I found this to be a fun workout, although boxing purists may find that it's not authentic enough.

It has been awhile since I have fallen in love with a DVD and this one broke the dry spell. Of course, I also really liked the other DVD she released at the same time - Lean Body Circuits.",1434499200,,2690,4.453061224489796
8737032,5,B016PGEUJY,"My husband first found this at the library. I guess he was tired of my buying new videos. Anyway, I ended up buying this because it was so good! I promised that this will be my base workout and I will go to the library for variety (mixed with others I own).

She is really good at taking you just to the point of giving up and then changing the move. It doesn't feel like punishment as when I watch JM. I like that there are options on the video to change up your workout. Plus, my co-workers noticed the changes on my arms after two weeks!",1536019200,,540,4.046728971962617

The upper body weights is a little boring and has lots of repetitions but I'd kinda prefer that to a bunch of crazy, potentially injurious moves you find on SOME current workout DVD's. The weakest work-out option is the yoga. She moves really fast through it and it's the same sequence over and over. That's not how I like to do my yoga or stretching. But I didn't really didn't buy this DVD for the yoga and overall, it's great.",1522022400,,539,4.294117647058823
