5372215,5,B009YDAGVC,"Having owned several Akita's over the years, I'm especially interested with the story of Hachiko. I saw the latest movie ""Hachiko a dogs tale"" as soon as it was released. I personally didn't care for it as it was more fabricated using an American family (I'm American).It was not historically accurate and seemed a little contrived. I have heard about ""Hachiko Monogatari"" and did not have a chance to purchase it until recently. It was in my opinion  far superior to the latest movie. My family and I really enjoyed this movie as it seemed to better capture the essence of Hachiko's incredible story.",1379894400,14,601,4.778846153846154

8545221,5,B009YDAGVC,"Hachiko is a haunting and touching film. it deals with what we might state as a simple stort among a profesor and his noble pet.

Hachiko -loyal to death- accompanies him everyday to the station, and awaits for him at the evening. But when his master dies, the invaluable partner will keep a close affection. It will return over and over again waiting for him.

The lesson the nature gives us adresses two essential principles. One: it demonstrates the intelligence is present at the nature; two: the natural law is above any human ethic, proving the loyalty has nothing to do with second intentions or any other compromise.

Deeply heart-breaking. For all of those who had a pet at least in one stage of our lives, this film is a tribute to the best partner of the human being.

Don't miss it. This original version is above the version of 2010.",1428883200,,846,4.582781456953643

THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!!!
Only someone who owns or has owned a dog can understand the unconditional love and loyalty a dog can have for its' human ""pack.""  This film is a highly fictionalized account of the Japanese dog Hachi.  Hachi was adopted by Prof. H.Ueno as a puppy in 1924 and they bonded and became inseparable almost immediately.  Hachi accompanied Ueno to the commuter train station every morning and met him there every evening.  This is all recounted in the first hour of the film.  One day in May, 1925, Hachi and Ueno went to the train in the morning as usual.  However, the professor had a stroke in class and died at work.  The final hour of the film portrays Hachi's life from then on, including going to the train station every evening for 10 more years, hoping that his beloved master will appear at the exit gate.  After her husband's death Mrs. Ueno tries to pass the dog off on her uncle and then her gardener so she can move away.  She clearly has no idea where Hachi has been going every evening since her husband died.  And when the gardener dies suddenly, his widow  closes up her rented house, tells Hachi that street dogs should be proud and free, takes her cat, and goes back to her relatives..  She quite literally throws Hachi into the street without a second thought, having made no arrangements for his care at all. Several years later, when the newspapers publish stories about Hachi's nightly vigil , Mrs. Ueno returns to find him a feral dog, waiting just as she read.  However, while Hachi remembers her and accompanies her to an inn, he leaves as soon as he has a good meal in his belly.  Several brief scenes after show Hachi clearly hiding from her.  As she says, he thinks that she will just give him away again.  Although it is not stated, one gets the idea that she at last regrets passing Hachi off and has come to take him with her.  The only people who demonstrate any concern for Hachi at all are the train station manager and a kind hearted couple who own a food cart that they put up at the station every day.  They try to feed Hachi with varying degrees of success.  Even the (one would assume)  same people who rode the train with the professor every day don't care - even after the newspaper article appear, no one lifts a finger.

The film is very well done on the whole.  There is no overacting, the story being wrenching enough.  The actor playing the professor displays unrestrained joy in his buddy, even to the point of bringing Hachi into the main house from a dog house during a drenching storm, drying him off, lighting a heater to warm him, and falling asleep with him, and being flabbergasted at his wife's displeasure.  He and the dog even bathe together! His pride as he walks around town with his dog is palpable.  The actress portraying Mrs. Ueno is very careful to play everything with great restraint.  She does not come across as mean, but more as rather thoughtless as far as Hachi's welfare is concerned as she attempts to put her grief behind her as quickly as possible by selling her house, giving her husband's dog away, and moving in with her married daughter's family and then ffurther away to care for her elderly mother.  At the beginning of the film, she does not want a dog, she feels little connection with the dog, and after her husband dies, she does not see herself as abandoning Hachi (at a time when he already feels abandoned).  But she is.
The small details of Japanese life and home are particularly interesting.  There are a couple of minor anachronisms but nothing to cry about.  It is very interesting to see the number of people, particularly women who still wore traditional dress in the 1920s.  Mrs. Ueno even wears her hair in a traditional manner until after he husband dies, when she goes to something more modern.

My main issue with this film occurs at the very end.  In the final scene, a very old, very thin, very ill Hachi almost seems to know he is going to die VERY soon.  He makes a final visit to the train station in the hope that he will see his adored professor just once more before he does die.  There is a cut to a dream-like scene of a very young Hachi running through a meadow and leaping into the waiting arms of his master in an emotional reunion in the afterlife in which Hachi literally embraces his master, one foreleg on each shoulder and his head nuzzled in Ueno's neck.  If you are not already crying, you will be when you see that. Then the film cuts to a close up of the face of the dead Hachi, his glazed eyes half open as if fixed on something we can't see, and snow falling on him.  There is a very long pull back as the area comes to life for the day and everyone ignores the still form at the gate.  Finally, we see Hachi's body on the sidewalk across the street, and his gaze is fixed on the glow of a street lamp close to us, as if he were looking toward the light of heaven.  This is accompanied by the bittersweet music for strings used for these scenes.  Then the credits start to roll as the passers-by continue to ignore Hachi.  But instead of more music in the same vein, the music is a mid 1980s contemporary adult pop song.  The lyrics are not translated.  There is a repeated English phrase, ""Remembering You,""  but with no translation of the rest of the lyrics, we don't know if the remembering is happy, sad, or indifferent.  Regardless, the style and beat of the song are completely at odds with the entire score generally and everything that has gone on both visually and aurally for the previous ten minutes.  It is very jarring and since the last hour of the film is essentially a tear jerker, completely out of place.

I loved this film.  I knew I was going to be emotionally manipulated going in, since I was already familiar with the basics of the story.  It is partly a morality tale in which someone behaves with thoughtless cruelty she later comes to regret, and also a lesson in the fact that our dogs also experience loss, although they can't verbalize it and we can't explain it to them.  It makes you realize that if you are owned by a dog, you are experiencing one of the greatest gifts you can be given.  This film is a must have for anyone who is or ever has been loved by a dog.  I do not, however, recommend that this be viewed by children, as it is very likely to upset them greatly.  But, buy, watch, and thank God for the furry creature waiting for you every night with a tail wagging.",1401321600,,6641,4.399180327868852
8545224,5,B009YDAGVC,"I chose this rating, because I watched this movie on a free website and found it so beautiful, heartbreaking and loving that I wanted to own it. I ordered it from Amazon, but discovered the DVD would not play. I then read the Amazon reviews, which said this DVD would not play on U.S. DVD players.  It is the original film made of the true story of Hachiko, a dog in prewar Japan, whose devotion to his Japanese owner continues for 6 years after his master's death, until his own. The final scene's beauty and poignancy haunts me still.  An American version with Richard Gere, called Hachi, was made not too long ago.  It is a good movie, but not a remake of the original film. Hachi takes place in present day America with an American owner.  Very touching and worth seeing, but not comparable to the original.  Amazon, please acquire a DVD of the Japanese film that DVD players for sale in America can play.",1400112000,8,909,4.451807228915663
8545225,1,B009YDAGVC,"The seller has advised me that reading these reviews was my responibility. And, had I read them, I would have been aware of the lack of ability to play in the USA. Even though it stated nothing of that fact in the whole purchase experience.",1391990400,4,240,4.355555555555555
8545226,5,B009YDAGVC,"I saw this original version with English subtitles and found it very moving. I, however, found the timeline somewhat confusing especially towards the end. The film jumps from his loving master's death and eventual abandonment in 1925 to December of 1928 when an article on Hachi and his loyalty to his master is published in the local newspaper. Initially Hachi had been trained  by his master to accompany him daily to the train depot to see him off and greet his return from his day's work. Hachi, however, continued this for years long after his master's death. Daily, Hachi would embark at the same time to seek his master at the station. Notwithstanding the article and the notoriety it bestowed, Hachi acquired only a brief reprieve from the ill treatment he had received while living as a stray still seeking his master. He does have one friend however that tries to protect him, that is the meat vendor at the train depot where Hachi continually returns. The film then jumps to May of 1934, showing his former mistress living comfortably by the ocean.  That scene suddenly changes back to the train station where Hachi is standing near the gate at the place where he used to greet his master. By now, Hachi appears unkempt, old, thin, tired and unhealthy and seemingly fears humans. It is in the afternoon and a windy storm is moving in. The vendor who has apparently not seen Hachi in a while spots him and approaches calling his name, but tragically Hachi runs leaving the vendor very sad. This is where I have trouble following the timeline for I cannot tell if we are still in the spring or now in the winter, the afternoon before Hachi's death. I assume it is the winter for the wind storm moving in might indicate incoming snow. Anyhow, the scene changes to the depot the following?? morning in the early hours, perhaps 2 or 3 am, the streets are vacant with the street lamps providing just enough light. It is quiet, the colors are a metallic black and white, and there is a light snowfall. Hachi approaches the gates calling for his master one last time. It is here where his search finally concludes. He begins to have visions of a parade of nameless faces passing before him out of which one sole figure emerges, the figure he has always known and recognizes. His master slowly approaches, smiling, beckoning. A now young and alive Hachi is running in a Park filled with trees, blossoms and grasses in bloom, dews, magnificent smells and the bright Spring Morning hues of green, purple and blue. He runs to his young living master who joyfully awaits with open arms and is calling him by name. Hachi, running out of himself and into his master's arms, finally completes his journey. But soon thereafter blossoms begin to fall from the trees and the colors fade back to the blacks, whites, and grays of the station with its sterile, cold, colorless and indifferent life. In the oncoming dawn all that remains is Hachi's lifeless body lying flat in front of the depot facing the opposite side of the road, covered in snow. There is just enough morning light, the streetlamps extinguish. The date 'March 8, 1935' appears. Very sad, very moving.

Just one final note: Hachi dies looking into the open spaces across the road, to the 'other side', perhaps towards home or a new Home, or into the light of the streetlamp across the street; but at last not looking into the old cage, the depot where the endless parades of shadows and dark figures had passed for so long. Perhaps it is the tall streetlamps that supply the light and the panorama he experiences in his final vision: the lamp posts become trees; the snow covered road the path he runs in reuniting with his master; the lamp post directly across the road with its extended arms and suspended bulbs becomes the focal point and joy of  his final breath, for in it his master receives him with open arms; the falling snow the falling blossoms; and finally the falling blossoms themselves become both reality and 'transition to'-  simply put, a symbol of cessation, Death. As he passes he leaves a snapshot of his final moments, his final gaze fixed upon the light of his master, upon a new side, a new place, a colorful new Beginning, ..... upon peace. His long struggles finally conclude. At dawn, the morning traffic appears unaware of his remains, or perhaps they just don't 'see' him anymore (if they ever did). Their indifference has blinded them not only to his belated existence but also to one another. But their response is irrelevant for he is not a participant in this world any longer; his capacities for loyalty and commitment helped lay the path back to his master. The film ends as it began, in snow marking ends that are in fact Beginnings. We know that Hachi did in fact die in the early morning hours of March 8, 1935, but not at the station. He passed a little behind the southeastern part of the station, just beyond a set of railroad tracks by the side of a liquor store. It turns out the proprietor there had been friendly with him, often giving him food and water. In his last hours, he may have been working his way towards that location for some comfort, perhaps water, sensing that death was imminent. Finding only a dark establishment, no-one awake or present, he simply lied down and went to sleep, and passed on. (see Dr. Mayumi Itoh's fine work on Hachi)",1389398400,11,5355,4.632631578947368
