8508274,1,6304557833,"I have to get the word out there to warn the public about these arena titles. They are trying to bank off of  the American Success of John Woo, Chow Yun Fat and Jet Li. Let me review them in a few steps.<p>  #1. Some of the titles aren't even John Woo or Chow Yun Fat  films. The one called 'Hong Kong  Corruptor' (banking off  the success of the Corruptor), is actually an Alan Tam film entitled  'Return  Engagement' (a better tomorrow ripoff) with an  unrelated Chow Yun Fat scene from another film  pointlessly  edited in. This one 'Hong Kong Face Off' (key words FACE OFF), i cannot  place. I know  John Woo's filmography and I can't place this  one (if anyone can tell me the real title, please mail me).  John Woo's directorial debut 'Hand Of Death' was released on Arena home  video as 'Strike Of Death',  and banks more on the apperance  of Jackie Chan (only a minor character in the film, but takes over the  cover of the box). so all in all, point #1- the films don't  really match.<p>  #2- Extremely poor quality. I purchased  'Strike Of Death, and master copy it was from must have been  warped. The picture quality was horrbile. Another one I bought 'Shanghai  Killer' was a HK tv movie  called 'The Bund'. this one was  just cheesy tv fare, with nothing good but the laughs. Another was an early  CYF film called 'Blodd money' under another title, which  had subtitles, but the film was a pan and scan  version, so  the subtitles were totally chopped off throughout the whole film, leaving  it indecipherable.<p>  The only one purchased that was decent  quality and a fun movie to own was under the Arena title 'Killers  Two', which was pawning itself off as a sequel to the killer (how?).  It is actually a very early 80's film  called 'Heroic Cops',  with a stickly thin Yun-Fat, and Danny lee sporting flare pants and horrid  haircuts.  This film is only good for unintentional laughs,  and the Cantonese Version of 'Stayin' Alive""!<p>  All in  all, Beware these Arena Titles. I stopped buying them. It's better to get  the HK version.",954288000,5,2053,4.542699724517906
