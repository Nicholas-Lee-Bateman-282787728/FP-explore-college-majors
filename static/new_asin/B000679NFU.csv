2171026,5,B000679NFU,"The Regency House Party brings together 10 men and women from all walks of modern day British life to spend nine sunny weeks living and breathing the life of a regency house party complete with chaperones, servants, and 19th century rules of behaviour. I loved them all, from the very handsome and witty host, Mr Gorrell-Barnes (Mr Darcy, eat your heart out!) to Zebedee the Hermit( a man with an excellent line in ironic humour). There is a real life penniless russian Countess with her sights set on Mr Gorrell-Barnes as a suitable match, aided and abetted by her shrewd chaperone Mrs Rogers, an undeniable attraction between real life aristocrat and chaperone Lady Devonport and Mr Foxsmith, not to mention the no-nonsense Miss Hopkins and rivals for her affections Mr Everett and Mr Carrington. In fact, by half way through the DVD you have to remind yourself that these are 21st century men and women simply being observed for nine weeks in an unusual setting, so captivating are some of the ongoing storylines (Mr Everett and Miss Hopkins for one). Its educational, historically accurate and a great watch for anyone with an interest in the regency.",1107820800,8,1155,4.8979591836734695
2171047,1,B000679NFU,"...based on other Amazon reviews, I went ahead and bought this. And even my low expectations weren't met! I appreciate that the producers thought the whole ""marriage market"" angle would provide oomph. Instead, however, it simply interfered with the audience learning what we might have about the life and times of these people.

Give us more insight into the freedoms and limitations of the times, of the intricacies, the passions, the boredom of the day-to-day routines. Give us more on the insights the modern-day people are gaining. Give us follow-up on how this experience impacted their perspectives on today.

Give us less of the trumped-up romances... no voiceover could have made them interesting!",1298419200,5,705,5.230088495575221
2171048,5,B000679NFU,"Can there be any more perfect period in English history? Can there be more comfortable houses and settings? Well yes, I suppose so, but this will do. There's freedom in the air, enquiry, science budding, none of the heavy strictures of the hulking industrial age with its over-dressing and hypocritical protocols. Women's clothing still has its French Revolution freedom - think of it, almost fifty years of the empire style - like jeans for us today, a fashion going on for decades. Brave sallies of wit and battle horsemanship still matter. Poets like Byron, Shelley and Keats have kindled the fires of romance - a seeking out of classical roots, a new Renaissance.

This show captures some of the perennial facts of British life as well - the class structure which is accepted as a given, the ruthless kiss up kick down system of jockeying for a higher place in the hierarchy, the role of money, and the importance of beauty and breeding, as well as the persistent love of games, many instances of that hearty British expression ""Well done!' when someone wins at some minor competition (yelled at me when I ran for a bus in London and swung up into it at the moment of departure from the curb).

The countryside portrayed here is sheer heaven.

I had to wonder sometimes at the focus of the series. It isn't Upstairs, Downstairs, because the staff at the house do not come to the fore until a patronizing fair and role reversal of a dinner in which ""Ich dien"" (""I serve"", motto of the Prince of Wales) comes into play when the gentlemen treat the servants to a scanty but fine dinner. There is a remark made by the lord of the manor to the effect that he is less interested in courting a suitable lady than in getting it on with a servant girl. But perhaps that was simply being his character. In fact I saw no chemistry between him and any of the intended contenders.

The chaperones really get into their roles - tears and all - and one breaks rank to be more of her 20th century self (she must have retired by the 21st century). It's very hard to tell whether the drama is set up or whether they have begun to believe their roles so completely that they really are at odds and threatening to leave the production, doing the English equivalent of the table flip as performed by a New Jersey housewife. While this might be true in staged wrestling matches as well, it's hard to evaluate the reality of someone saying that they are talking strictly as a non-actor for the moment, and giving you a frank opinion of the other woman.

Oh, and was a chaperone's affair with a younger man real? Did it have to break off so soon? After all, famous liaisons in the Regency period between younger men on -the-make and married women (or widows) often enhanced the careers of the former by bringing wealth to them. One example is the marriage of Benjamin Disraeli to a widow fifteen years his senior, who had so much money to spend for Tory political campaigns that she set him up to be Prime Minister eventually. Was this love and companionship? Certainly. A woman of forty is far from washed up sexually. But I felt the show, while it proposed other controversial facts about the Regency (such as the acceptance of a woman of color who came with wealth from the Caribbean) seemed to hesitate to state how widespread was the importance of older women in men's careers. In some ways, this was even hotter than the more normal courtship with younger women, who were afraid that they might be the one in three to die in childbirth. One young contender, a beautiful lass, decided to tell her chaperone that she would make her way in London as a courtesan, rather than be tied down to brood mare status. Interestingly, the chaperone thinks it a good plan but wonders how to break it to the parents who have consigned their charge to her. She opines that the girl certainly has the looks and wit to carry off some notable affairs in the big wicked city!

I cannot help speculating on other stories to pursue along these lines. The Regency one certainly did not overtax the party goers as much as some of the other time travelers (those in Frontier House actually worked and suffered, risked disaster and lost massive amounts of weight). How far is a reality show willing to go to expose its participants to real life risk?

So here are some thoughts for other series: Shipmates to Australia, Immigrants in the Lower East Side, Monks in Dark Age Ireland. GPS and antibiotics are acceptable, and fist fights will be staged, but otherwise it could be a lot of fun.

Keep brain-storming, and bring them on!",1280188800,,4590,4.555151515151515
2171049,2,B000679NFU,"I passionately love history, particularly British history, and I really looked forward to viewing this show.  I have to say, though, that I am  disappointed and was very bored watching these people try to look like they were living in a different age.  They were, for the most part, very unappealing, and while I love ""Pride and Prejudice"", and Jane Austen's other works, they were fiction.  I guess I just found the jump back and forth between centuries too much to empathize with as I did not care at all who these people married, who they bedded, how much wine they drank, etc or what century they were pretending to live in.  But I will give the concept an ""E"" for effort and realize that I am in the minority - in this case, anyway.",1276732800,2,737,4.42962962962963
2171050,5,B000679NFU,"what a wonderful series. if you are trying to entice a young lady in your household to read Pride and Prejudice and want to get her beyond the movie versions, this is a ""reality"" series that may just get her attention.  I sat down to watch with my stepdaughter and she was hooked.  Not only is it a who-gets-hooked-up-with-who but it also has wonderful commentary on the lifestyles, the class structure and the polite ""rules of engagement"" for genteel society. I watched part of ranch house and it fell short, but this was just wonderful with answers to questions about bathing, rooming, manners, meal service etc.  if you are an Austen fan or even just of the period, this is worth the time invested. it is pricey, but maybe you could see if you could rent it or something.  Also, it would have been nice to know if any of the pairings worked out long term ""after the chaperones left"".",1270598400,,886,4.51875
2171051,3,B000679NFU,"I asked for this series for my birthday present because I'm a huge fan of works by Jane Austen and thought it would be a dream come true to take part in this experiment, so viewing it would be fun, too. But I was wrong. Perhaps it was enjoyable for the players, but it was totally disappointing for this viewer. I suppose I shouldn't have expected a bunch of modern folks, old or young, male or female, to be as witty as the great Miss Jane and her delightful band of fictional characters, but unfortunately I did. Hence the disappointment. I give it a three, but the only real joy in the series for me was watching the various period entertainments go on - like when Sir Jeremy takes the other participants through a mock Battle of Trafalgar on a pond. It was interesting to see how people spent their time back when there was no TV. But there were also few sparks, and little wit, so I'm back to watching ""Persuasion"" for the umpteenth time. SAVE YOUR MONEY. This provides none of what you're looking for, Austen fans! Final thought - I agree with another reviewer who panned this - too much time was spent on Victoria and her inability to decide between suitors. Should have been called the LIBRA house party. YUCH.",1224374400,3,1218,4.441964285714286
2171052,5,B000679NFU,"I first watched part of Regency House Party on PBS (I think) over New Year's several years ago.  It was pure luck that I came upon it again and was able to watch the whole series through Netflix.

It's certainly the best reality TV show I've ever seen.  I know that's a dubious honor, but I usually hate reality TV.  What's so refreshing about this miniseries is that there are no prizes for which the individuals are competing, and no silly challenges or eliminations.  It works as an interesting study into the social dynamics of the past, because although the main participants are all thoroughly modern and not, for the most part, very excited about following the social mores of the Regency period, the conduct of the chaperones (who are meant to, and usually do, uphold the social structure of the period) and the house servants is enough to change the behavior of the main players.

I haven't seen any of the other ""House"" series, but I'm eager to, and I've watched this series more than once.  I even purchased it as a gift for a family member a week or so ago.

While it might not suit everyone, I found it funny, interesting, and beautiful to watch.",1218153600,3,1159,4.538461538461538
2171053,3,B000679NFU,"Excellent for information on period detail and life in the Regency tidbits, marred by a boring cast who seemed unable to get into the spirit of things and kept comparing Regency life to the 21st century. Barring the Countess, few others seemed to want to play along with the game. Wish they'd chosen more interesting, intelligent, charismatic, creative and dramatic people who were knowledgeable about the time period, instead of merely good-looking ones.",1205280000,3,455,5.2465753424657535
2171054,4,B000679NFU,"I recently discovered the PBS House series and watched all of them. Regency House Party was very good compared to most drivel on television, but was only moderately entertaining for a House show.  I agree with the earlier reviewer in that they focused much too much on the ""romance"" between the participants (which all seemed very forced and completely chemistry-free)and not enough on the period details.  I also missed the preparations for the show that were so prominent in the 1900 house.  And why on earth is there no follow-up on the participants and how they felt about the experience after returning to their modern life?
It was still a very enjoyable show, I really thought it was quite funny how the men embraced their lifestyle of leisure, and how bored out of their minds the women are.  I would recommend particularly to anyone who enjoys Regency history.",1197331200,3,868,4.844594594594595
2171055,5,B000679NFU,"If after watching the first few minutes of this series you find yourself having flashes of Pride and Prejudice, do not be alarmed. This era in time was very similar. Chaperones were in charge of young girls of marrying age; their job was to ensure a good financial match for their charges. This house recreates that time with four (and later five) girls and an equal amount of elligible bachelors for them to choose from. It is all about finding a suitable match while living under the code of the regency house days. Modesty is of the utmost importance here and status is everything. The guests include women with titles to men with the means to buy theirs all the way down to a hermit who lives on the grounds. The limits on the behavior of the couples might give the false impression that this series will be boring, but it is anything but. The slow dance is fascinating to see and educational as well.

Although it is obvious that a full re-encarnation of the regency period could not be put into effect because the guests are aware that they will return to their normal lives, it is interesting to see them coupling off anyway. The same rules of the 1810s do not apply to these relationships after the two months is over, so the women do not take status or the need to find a husband as seriously as they would if they did. However, the isolation of the day and the drastically different moral code does affect the matchmaking.

This series makes an excellent companion to Manor House. Both are set in England, though they are certainly a length of time apart, but this series focuses on the lives of the elite while Manor House delves into a life of servitude.

Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat abrupt and despite the six hour length of the series, it seems rather short. However, that is the mark of a quality program: leaving the viewer wanting more.",1197072000,3,1863,4.538690476190476
2171056,5,B000679NFU,"There comes a time when you stumble upon a series that get's you so drawn in that it almost becomes your companion.  When the series was all over I cryed for a few good minutes just because it was all over!  I highly recommend it to any girl who lives to love Jane Austen and her works, because this series really will put you direcly in her shoes.",1195084800,,348,4.102941176470588
2171067,4,B000679NFU,"I quite throughly enjoyed the production, though I would have to admit that I've no strong interest in following up with the other series of the PBS productions.

The reception of a 6-hr long voyeuristic venture could elicit a diametrical range of responses from plain boredom, drudgery to even sheer delight, depending on what expectations you bring into watching.

I confess that I'm not a fan of reality series and in fact, cast more than a skeptical eye on them, but I'm primarily drawn to the Regency House Party in lieu of my interests and research into the Regency Era.

I thought that the series, far from being an ad hoc assemblage of the lights of blair witch undertakings, was most professionally done to the effect that is akin to watching a 6-hr miniseries movie.

It would have been too easy had it been just a pure documentary of the Regency period, but the documentary bits had been rather judiciously interspersed throughout and at relevant points, juxtaposed with the reality experiences of the house party guests.

My only suspension of belief required was how seriously the guests took to their roles their individual responsibilities and for example, Captain Glover's unflinching grasp of the ""fact"" that he had been made a baron following the end of the Napoleonic War (despite the fact that it would not transpire into actual circumstances in his 21st century identity).

Other than this aspect, I thought the production was as smooth, seamless  and realistic it could be, considering that double standards notwithstanding were bound to occur to accomodate deeply entrenched 21st century personalities into the unfamiliar world of the Regency.

The only disappointment, I thought, was the rather inconsequential ending, which would probably have been compensated by a more explanatory round-up found in the book tie-in, which in my opinion, goes hand-in-hand with the DVD and which is even more excellent in terms of its clarity, comprehensiveness and informative pitch.",1188086400,,1993,5.12962962962963
2171068,2,B000679NFU,"We were frustrated with trying to understand what these people were saying.  Who can understand the British accents?

2171069,1,B000679NFU,"I have watched all of the PBS ""house"" series. The 1900 house, colonial house, frontier house, 1940's house,  and Manor House, For some reason i am a sucker for ripping away modern Convieniances from poor helpless people and plunking them smack dab in the middle of chamberpots and candles. This installment in the series, Regency House Party, is a 6 hour frustrating repetitive anti climatic mess. Five men and Five women are given status in the house based on thier real life families and jobs, we are supposed to see them form relationships and than agree or disagree to a ""fake"" marriage, The goal of the women is to marry rich, and marry up, the goal of the men is to bag a good breeder, preferably marry for money and stuff thier trousers. I suppose we are meant to observe how frustrating it was for women back then, stuck with strict chaperones confined to the house, never to jump and run about with the men, oh its so unfair that they are to have ""lots of babies"" and ""one in three"" will die in childbirth. One of them decides that instead of being a ""baby machine"" she will become a ""courtesan""...a prostitute, because thats so much better and its ""her"" choice. yep Syph, starvation, and millions of abortions is my kind of life. I would have taken the 1 in 3 bet.
None of these people, not one really got what it was all about. The men were too busy trying to seduce chaperones, out drink eachother, and oggle all the pushed up busoms they seriously didn't care about marrying these women, even if it was fake. The women were too busy complaining about the lack of feminine hygiene, and how they had to be chaste, and how it was ultimately boring being them. One of them, the ""industrial hieress"" Victoria Hopkins see sawed between ""snogging"" mr Everett and slobbering all over mr carrington, I swear 5 hours of this series was devoted to her ""dilemma"" and how she should think with her head not her heart, she goes back and forth so much that by the end when she goes for the money, you wish she had choked on all the rose petals these men threw at her.
The Chaperones were pitiful as well, grown women throwing slaps and demanding apologies left and right, fans and plates across rooms, meeting men in the barn for a ""ghost watch"" (presumably the ghost of supple past)
I read an interview with Chris Gorell Barnes who was the ""top"" man, that he didn't learn a thing and that he was getting it on with the chambermaid who was actually his valets girlfriend.
I suppose i really wanted these men and women to seriously act thier parts, follow through, leave the 21st century BS behind. Embrace the lifestyle and in turn learn something about modern romance through regency relationships, but NONE of them came out of this with an Iota of clarity.
So I lost 6 hours, these people lost two months and not the better for it.",1171238400,59,2831,4.497087378640777
2171070,5,B000679NFU,"Of all the recent reality ""House"" series shown by PBS, such as 1900 House, Manor House, Frontier House, Colonial House, and others, this is the one that succeeds most brilliantly in escaping the present and re-capturing more fluidly the bygone era toward which the producers of this sociological project were grasping. This 2004 presentation is by far the most entertaining in the line of shows that document the experiences and reactions of twenty-first-century women and men who find themselves dealing with moral protocol and technology as it existed in the past.

Here concentrating on the year 1811 in Great Britain's Regency era (so called because the Prince of Wales was elevated to Regent in the face of his father, George III's, incurable psychological illness), five unmarried women and five unwed men, along with five middle-aged female chaperones, are ensconced in a lovely manor house and adjacent property in the hills of Herefordshire. For nine weeks of summer, these couples interact within the complicated restrictions of Regency courtship, and the relationships that spring up are recorded. The roles played by modern people take broad lines and range from a sea captain, a wealthy industrialist, a landed gentleman, an army officer, to a (secretly penniless) Russian countess, the daughter of a nouveau riche commercialist, a spirited but lowly female companion to a chaperone, and above all of them, the stern, goddess-like figure of the acting hostess and matchmaker, the dauntingly proper Mrs. Rogers.

I found the amount of detail and imagination that was invested in Regency House Party was what took this from a dry bit of otherwise well-intended pretend time travel, to something genuinely entertaining. At under fifty-bucks, this six-hour two-disc set is a steal!",1164672000,4,1790,5.299295774647887
2171071,5,B000679NFU,"Ya gotta love any show that includes a man arising from bed in the middle of the night to make a huge ""B Happy"" sign (out of hay and rose petals) on the lawn to cheer up a young lady.  Romantic gestures like that one, as well as having servants sneak love notes into the room of your amour, arranging a fireworks display, and reenacting the naval battle of Trafalgar happen aplenty in his entry in the historical ""House"" series, and I found it enchanting.

I felt that most of the volunteers genuinely did their best to put aside their modern personas and to react and behave as they would have in 1811.  Of course there were some jarringly anachronistic displays of swearing, inappropriate flirtations and young girls sneaking off for secret rendezvous with men. But all in all, up until the last night (when the chaperones had gone), the modern young men and women did a fine job of behaving as was expected of them. As luxurious as their surroundings were, it couldn't have been easy to spend nine weeks using a chamber pot, having one bath a week, or sitting for three hours at the dinner table during those hot summer nights wearing elegant but stifling  clothes.

I would like to have seen the DVD include a special features section with an aftermath, or update, of the participants.  I would especially love to know what became of Jeremy Glover, who played the Naval Captain elevated to the peerage.  I felt that he deserved considerably better than to be ""settled for"" by anyone. Also, I'm curious as to whether Mr. Foxsmith found happiness at last.",1153440000,11,1557,4.619565217391305

2171073,3,B000679NFU,"Let me start off by saying I really enjoyed ""Manor House"" and felt it gave me a good feel for what Edwardian country house life was like, so that is the bar I am comparing ""Regency House Party"" too.

I did not feel like I learned nearly as much from ""Regency House Party"": There was a lot of focus on interpersonal relations, but it was more from the ""problems a modern woman has fitting into the regency role"" rather then the problems the participants are experiencing that reflect problems a regency woman experienced. There were multiple times where the viewer is told ""and now the host is doing something that no regency man would ever do"" which I felt was a cop-out. Yes, his reactions in trying to ease tensions among the women were absolutely what a modern manager would try to do. However, I would've preferred the modern anachronistic behaviors to have far less prominence in the show.

""Regency House Party"" is, too some extant a dating show, but I felt that the editing of the show made if very hard to track who was who and who's interested in who and why. I kept referring back to the character summary provided in the associated book (which does not come as part of the DVD) to try to sort the characters out. I'm not sure if the problem was that there were too many people to follow or if the problem was the show trying to be both a dating show and a ""slice of life in the Regency"".

The show did point out some features of Regency life that were very interesting/novel to me (especially as a fan of Regency romance novels): How sharply divided men's and women's activities were, how central the evening meal was to social life, and to some extent how hobbies and activities fit into the ""courtship process"".",1127088000,13,1724,4.484076433121019
2171074,2,B000679NFU,"The brilliant idea behind the House series is to take ""reality"" television into a new sphere. The two I saw before this, Manor House and 1940 House, were wildly entertaining as well as full of sociological and cultural insights.

Unfortunately, Regency House Party trashes the concept. It is little more than ""Big Brother"" in period dress. Essentially, they've just brought a group of rather uninteresting people into a matchmaking situation. The setting and costumes seem nothing more than trimmings, and the cultural lessons are abruptly inserted at regular intervals.

All that would be acceptable if it resulted in some form of entertainment, but it does not. Almost all the participants seem bored to tears as they're put through their paces, and the viewer is left with nothing. What little drama there is seems artificially created in the editing room.

I suggest you pass by the door of this House and move on to the next.",1119052800,23,930,4.987096774193549
2171075,5,B000679NFU,"I saw various bits of this series on PBS but due to schedule and forgetfulness I missed some chunks of the program. Despite this, the parts that I did see were enjoyable enough that I knew I would purchase the DVD set, and I was not disappointed.

I generally don't care for reality shows, but the PBS ""House"" series are an exception, and among those that I have seen this is the standout. The setting (an 1815 country house) and the scenario (young people and chaperones convening with the goal of being coupled by the end) were very appealing, and the players -- charming host Mr Gorell Barnes, determined Captain Glover, tenacious Mr Everett, frustrated Mr Foxsmith, suave Mr Carrington, enigmatic Countess Griaznov, saucy Miss Conick, flirtatious Miss Hopkins, aspiring Miss Braund, somewhat-excluded Miss Martin and stately Miss Samuels, along with older female chaperones Mrs Rogers, Lady Devonport, Mrs Hammond and Mrs Enright, as well as an army of very professional servants -- are for the most part likeable and certainly interesting to watch. The fact that the ""characters"" are based on their modern-day counterparts is a particularly clever idea. In addition, some visiting characters such as the posturing dandy and the humorous hermit, as well as experts in Regency subjects from phrenologists to personal trainers, add exciting interludes for the somewhat isolated country party.

The one frustration (which is common in these programs and is certainly understandable, but nonetheless sometimes irritating) is that some of the individuals seem to have a hard time remembering that they are to some degree playing characters, and they do not always react as they would have had to within the protocol and restrictions of the time period. Rather than declaring, ""I would never do that in real life,"" the thought should have been ""If I had really lived in this time and situation, these would have been my options and my lot"" and historical conclusions drawn accordingly; a more anthropological approach from some quarters would have been appreciated. This is especially true of situations which in reality would have jeopardized one's reputation. But, this was of course an unscripted endeavor (though surely some suggestion and provocation must have been put in from the sidelines), and human nature is won't to invade. Still, when for example a young charge demands a written apology from her chaperone to smooth over a row, it seems that Regency etiquette and heirarchy have been completely abandoned.

The action in the first half of the series (that is, disc 1) is somewhat slow-moving as everyone adjusts to their new personas; it is also somewhat dominated by clashes in the female group, most likely due to the culture shock of being removed from independent 21st century lives and plunked into comparatively torpid days of sewing, gossip and the occasional archery practice, generally always in group. The gentlemen seem to get on better, but their days are accordingly occupied with more activity and less stagnation.

The diversions and added characters and visitors in the second disc make the activities more dynamic, though nearer to the ending things start to feel rushed, presumably due to the nature of the editing. The plot certainly never gets boring, what with the intrigue, rumors, trysts, battles, attitudes and gestures that form a web of the group. The mounting romantic and sexual tension (in a time when ladies and gentlemen touched rarely and always under the eyes of a chaperone) adds intermittent frissons to the plot, and also exemplifies the elaborate ritual of past courtship, where anticipation and flirtation were an extended prelude to dating and mating.

If you are a history buff, the setting and costuming alone are worth your time, and the players all genuinely look the part, especially compared to the glimpses of them in their modern-day lives (though several of the girls by the end are looking significantly sunburned, which would have been a horror for a well-bred lady at the time).

In summary, this is definitely a worthwhile investment for ""historical reality"" fans as well as anyone who'd like to lose themselves (briefly) in another time and place. Enjoy it.",1116806400,9,4222,5.120464441219158
2171076,5,B000679NFU,"I caught about 15 minutes of the second or third episode a few months ago and just knew I'd never keep up with viewing the show (and I really wanted to watch it from its begining) so I've been planning on buying the DVD ever since. I'm so glad I finally did!

The 'players' in this history re-inacting ""reality dating show"" drama are people from modern England who agreed to play 'themselves as they might have been during the Regency'. They were given a summary of 'themselves' to go by. For example, in reality, the Countess is an actual countess who works in a coffee shop - at the House Party, she is a countess who is trying to cover up the fact that she has no money. The 'players' (I can't think of them as ""contestants"") play this 'game' in a sort of blurring of fantasy and reality - to the point, I believe, where they were reacting quite naturally as a Regency-era person and less like a modern-minded person.

The transition from modern-England to Regency-England was rough for many of the 'players' and they supported each other through the trials. Many hearts were touched and broken or bruised throughout the process and it was quite facinating to watch, even without the added bonus of doing so in Regency costume.

Fans of Regency (or Edwardian or Victorian) England or just history buffs should enjoy this show for what it is. I, being a huge fan of Jane Austen (particularly ""Pride and Prejudice""), was used to the methods of speech and manner and had a grand ol' time.

My mother, who is more of a reality show fan than a history or lit enthusiast, lost interest not even halfway through the first episode. If you have no interest or even basic knowledge of the time period, I'm not sure you'd enjoy it, even if you love reality/reality dating shows. Fights between 'players' are not shown on camera (though they are discussed in some depth) and the romantic... liasons... between the 'players' are merely implied, which would also account for disinterest from those accustomed to American reality tv.

The only thing I could have asked from PBS was an update on the 'players', particularly those who made 'matches' toward the end of the show. Did the couples stay together? Do any of them keep in touch? A reunion show would be a bonus. Heck, if a ""Regency Party 2"" were produced, I'd buy it immediately!

The only problem I think anyone could have is a sometimes-poor audio, caused by the difficulties of shooting in a historic house rather than a studio. A remote to adjust the volume should probably be in-hand at all times, along with the 'rewind' button on your DVD player remote. Anyone who has watched period movies (such as Jane Austen adaptations) is probably familiar with this and should have no problems with knowing how to follow the dialogue.",1113523200,45,2777,4.6456211812627295

8039541,5,B000679NFU,"The title, ""Regency House Party"" may at first sound like some kind of frat movie comedy but it is in fact a sort of reality TV series produced for PBS in many episodes.

In case it isn't obvious, the premise is similar to shows like ""Prairie House"" and ""1900's House"", wherein 21st Century people live for a time completely immersed in the social order and customs of Regency England... at a Manor house, complete with costumes, morals, manners, food, customs and so on.

The cast members are all Brits - which makes sense as the Manor House is in England and our view of Regency England, so influenced by Jane Austin, is particularly English.

This program (as it was designed for TV) is elegantly produced, with beautiful photography and very good editing of the interactions of the people living in the house. Some of them are charming, others, a bit silly, but they grow on you.

The program is augmented by a nice musical score, and it is actually quite believable. It offers something we don't get from ""Pride and Prejudice"", a darker look at Regency society, the impossible restrictions (especially for women), the amazing inequality of the sexes, the incredible frustration, and the boredom that aristocrats or ""gentry"" of the period must have endured.

And this is a wonderful eye opener. Austin is marvelous, as are most of the movies made from her works. Regency House Party certainly captures the spirit of her works. But it is also highly educational. I found the ""Science Week"" particularly interesting as they explored the emerging scientific discoveries of the age.

Oddly, there's also a segment for horror fans, though it's nothing like the gore fests we are used to in modern cinema. Regency folk were rather interested in the macabre as well as ghosts and vampires, and the characters in this program attempt to recreate how they might have entertained themselves in this genre. Watching them put on a vampire play to entertain themselves reminded me of Mary Shelly's preface to ""Frankenstein"", wherein she explains that she wrote the book as part of a ""ghost story writing"" contest with Lord Byron and Percy Shelly. I was thinking of this during the vampire play episode when to my surprise, they ALSO referenced ""Frankenstein""!

There is a visit from a period ""anatomist"" who has ""plasticized"" a number of human bodies to show the house guests (I think they actually used special props) and that segment, along with its references to Mary Shelly's novel, ""Frankenstein"", was rather creepy and a bit disturbing, but never in bad taste. I'm a fan of Shelly's novel, and this part of ""Regency House Party"" gave me a deeper realization of just how terrifying the novel must have been when it debuted in 1818.

I recommend this entire program for anyone who is fascinated by the Regency period. It appeared to be historically very accurate in look, manner and tone.

It is however a ""reality"" show, so a few allowances must be made for the characters who have difficulty adjusting to their new lifestyle. It must be a major psychological feat to shift from the amazing flexibility and convenience of our 21st Century society into the hierarchical and rigid world of Regency England.
Talk about an attitude adjustment!

There is one other thing to keep in mind while viewing this program. While it LOOKS like these people are completely immersed in the Regency period, living in a genuine manor house, wearing the costumes and all, it is important to remember that their actions are constantly being FILMED, obviously.

So as audience, we do NOT see the 21st Century elements that MUST have surrounded them during the entire experience, the cameras, the producers and directors of the program. These elements are entirely invisible to us, the audience, and of course, the program WE see is probably an edit of many more hours of filming, with many experiences and events ""on the cutting room floor"".

But it is a credit to everyone involved in this program that they presented such an alluring, elegant and enticing and believable vicarious Regency English experience in such a way that it really did appear that these folks were totally immersed in the Regency period.

I give it 5 stars for excellence. I found it totally engrossing, compelling, fascinating, and of course romantic. Everyone did a fantastic job. Bravo.

I also got a new realization of just how good life in the 21st Century is!

I'd have made a terrible Mr. Darcy!

Enjoy this production, it's worth it.",1350172800,,4489,4.879106438896189
8039542,3,B000679NFU,"I am not sure why she was chosen - maybe a friend of someone, but she spoiled the whole ""party""-her ego was so overpowering and she was so oversentive, that I have a strong suspicion she is a long time alcoholic. The reason why I was able to finish watching was because I was interested to find out more about life in those times, and I loved the host-he was very balanced and tried to do his best to keep peace. I learned to fast forward the parts with her face in it.
  Anyway, the show itself does give you quite a bit of details from life in regency life, intersperced with ""reality""stuff. So if you have patience or enjoy ""reality""part, then go for it.",1319760000,,657,4.248
8039543,5,B000679NFU,"This was a brilliant social experiment that put such fine points on the realities of life during the Regency period.  Single 21st century men, women and their chaperones are thrown together for 6 weeks just as their counterparts would have been.  Quickly, it becomes apparent that the divide between the lives of men and the limits for women is especially challenging for 21st century people crammed into 19th century garments and social strictures. It's all one big party for the guys while it's a living hell for the girls--regardless of class.  Any reader of Jane Austen especially, will discover context that can profoundly change the way we understand the dilemmas of her characters and the social assumptions embedded in her stories.  Viewing this series should open the eyes of anyone who thinks this period was ""romantic.""

Most surprising and touching is the way that even though people are playing roles similar to the equivalent station they would have had in life 200 years ago, the feelings and relationships are so very real.  Fascinatingly, even in this Regency hothouse, love comes where and when you least expect it. I was able to find out from a Google search that at least one of the couples continued to see each other after filming ended. I would love to know how doing this show may have influenced the participants' choices when dating in the 21st century. Did the women come to expect chivalry? Did the men appreciate how capable and independent women are now in comparison to the long-ago past?  And what about the girls' chaperones? They were real ""characters."" I wonder what became of them most of all.  They added a shocking amount of drama to the couples' party.",1316908800,,1691,4.867595818815331
8039544,1,B000679NFU,"I was really looking forward to watching this since I have enjoyed the other PBS time traveler series. I made it through about fifteen minutes. There was nothing whatsoever attractive about the Regency Bucks. I'm not talking about their looks. Their behavior was horrendous. They were loud, rude and vulgar--and this was just the first night. I had to laugh at hearing how each wanted to meet ""the right woman."" How about starting by trying to be ""the right man"" for a decent woman? During the first meeting with the women all they could do was talk about who had a big ass and who might be pretty if she ditched her glasses.
Who chose these participants?

And I don't buy the argument that, being modern men, they had trouble adjusting to the confines of the period. Even in modern times, people are usually on the best behavior when starting out in a new situation.

Honestly, if you love Jane Austen, this will seem like a National Lampoon parody.",1304640000,6,950,4.615384615384615

Mixing the 21st century people with the regency era was always going to be fun and full of angst. I wasn't disappointed. Within in a day of being there it was tears and trauma and a general unwillingness to shake off their modern cloaks. As the series continued it became easier. For some they managed to adopt the attitudes they needed to slip into the skin of the Regency Lady and Gentleman, others ran headlong into conflict and others still into love. Every episode was filled with entertainment.",1302048000,,680,6.020618556701031
