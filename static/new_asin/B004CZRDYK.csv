8424188,4,B004CZRDYK,"A nice little jungle adventure movie starring Johnny Weissmuller.  After his Tarzan films had run their course producers felt he still had a lot of jungle left in him so he was put in a series of jungle pics starring as Jungle Jim, a sort of jungle guide and forest ranger.  This time around he is helping the U.S. government come to an agreement with a ""white"" pygmy tribe, in order to harvest a plant they grow which will help the USA make weapons or something.  Of course there are bad guys lurking on the sidelines who want the weed for themselves, for nefarious purposes, and are monkey-wrenching the good guys efforts.  An OK time-passer.  The black-and-white photography is super clear and pristine.  The Columbia-Classics DVD-R is an excellent transfer and high quality.  Worth getting.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1431388800,,830,4.836879432624113
