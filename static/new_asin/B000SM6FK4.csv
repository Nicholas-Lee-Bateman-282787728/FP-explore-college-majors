2887745,5,B000SM6FK4,"I was so surprised by the effectiveness of this workout! I have some other workout videos that are similar in that there are several ten-minute segments, but I haven't been happy with all of them.  This one is definitely my favorite!",1195084800,,233,4.682926829268292
2887746,5,B000SM6FK4,I have several workout dvds. I actually look forward to working out with this particular one. Amy is genuine...I cant emphasize enough how important that is. Most workout instructors I cant take seriously because they are so fake. Even a 10 minute workout will make me sore. I like feeling that even giving 10 minutes is making a difference. This dvd is fun and real and most absolutely worth every penny.,1195084800,8,405,4.71830985915493
2887747,5,B000SM6FK4,This is one of the only videos out there that is going to truly give you results. It does what it says it is going to do. Plain and simple.,1194998400,6,139,3.6666666666666665
2887748,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is the 4th fitness video I own and I am very pleased with my purchase. Amy Dixon, the instructor, is very clear and motivating; her fitness program really gets your heart pumping. Very high energy. I'm not overweight but I do have to be careful since I have a desk job. Her cueing is right on and I could follow the moves even the first time around. I think that this is the best workout video I own along with the other Women's Health. I will be on the lookout for more of Amy's videos.",1193961600,4,492,4.135416666666667
2887749,5,B000SM6FK4,"You might be thinking that in ten minutes you can't get anything done - this video will certainly prove that theory wrong. The cardio had my heart pumping in 3 minutes! It's divided up into 5 different 10 minute sessions targeting different areas of the body, it's great for the days where you don't have a lot of time to do your 30-60 minutes but still want to feel that your time is well spent.",1192579200,11,396,4.293333333333333
2887750,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is the second workout of Women's Health that I own.  I'm equally as impressed with this as their other new workout, Ultimate Fat Burn.  Amy Dixon is a fantastic instructor and she's fast becoming a favourite of mine.
You get a mix in here - cardio, toning and work for flexibility and balance.  You always know what's coming up because Amy cues so well.  She's encouraging and motivating.  The aerbics isn't too dancy and fancy but it does get your heart rate up and that helps burn fat.  Then there is upper toning and lower toning, both of which target lots of muscles in different ways (by changing your body angle, you work more muscles).  The stretching at the end is what helps your balance and flexibility and it's relaxing yet fun.  All you need are some dumbbells and for a bonus workout, you get a stability ball segment so you should have one of those on hand too.
It's not too hard to do, and it's fun yet effective and I'm so impressed that I'm buying these as birthday and holiday gifts for my friends.  I think everyone will find this as enjoying as I do, and if you stick with it, the results will come for sure.",1190851200,78,1133,4.357142857142857
2887751,5,B000SM6FK4,"I finally received my DVD's based on a recommendation by a friend, and I am SO happy that I did.  These new Women's Health workouts are so far superior to anything else I have, it's ridiculous.  The star Amy Dixon has more energy than anyone I've ever seen.  Seriously.  It must be a redhead thing.  I couldn't recommend them enough.

I would definitely say you should get both of these tapes to mix it up a bit, but for anyone just deciding between the two, here's a word of advice based on my initial testing...  The Ten Minute one is definitely for everyone.  It's amazing because who can't workout for ten minutes?  And there's four different ones.  But the Ultimate Fat Burn, while personally is my favorite, is definitely a little harder of a workout.  If you're just a beginner, it may be a little difficult for you.  But like I said before, I'd get them both.  Slow days?  Ten Minute Workout.  Harder Days?  Ultimate Fat Burn.

I hope this helps.  They really are amazing tapes.  I hope they make more.  The look of them is really different than anything I've seen.  It's not just in an empty room.  It really helps.

Enjoy them, and happy working out!",1190592000,26,1160,4.471153846153846
2887752,5,B000SM6FK4,"Although I won't be receiving my DVDs for four to six weeks; and, therefore, can't rate them, I can tell you that Amy Dixon is the best fitness instructor I've ever had the pleasure of taking classes from. I take her classes at Equinox in Santa Monica and her energy and dedication are unrivaled. I can't say enough amazing things about Amy Dixon. My body has changed because of her. I feel privileged to take her classes and even more privileged to call her my friend. Buy the DVD. Women's Health wouldn't make her their spokesperson for nothing.

P.S. I can't post this review without a rating so I'm giving it five stars.",1190073600,11,624,4.522123893805309

It is what it says, a TOTAL workout which includes aerobics, upper body, lower body, and stretching/cool down. The enitre workout can be done in 40 minutes or if you only have ten minutes you can choose which area you wish to work. A great addition to my other workout CD's.",1407110400,,414,4.32051282051282

I looked at the box for several weeks before I decided to give it a try. I didn't realize how bad of shape i was in! whew! the first time was rough! But it made me feel energized and I started doing it every other day. It can get a little monotonous, but not enough to make me not want to do it. I like how you can pick your workout if you have limited time or do the whole workout if you want to. I can already see the difference in my upper arms!",1399507200,2,579,3.7540983606557377

2887774,3,B000SM6FK4,"I enjoyed the workout, which was vigorous, fast-paced and really makes you move, and I also liked being able to choose the segments.  Having said that, I had a hard time not being distracted by the noises, calls, whistles or whatever was going on in the background.  To me, these were unnecessary and detracted from what would have been an enjoyable workout dvd.",1397606400,4,362,4.73015873015873

2887780,5,B000SM6FK4,"I love that this exercise DVD  breaks the workouts into 10 minute sessions. You can do one when pressed for time or many of them. I watched the entire DVD and I did three segments: the upper body, stretching/balance, and core segments. I will not likely use the aerobic segment or the leg toning segments. I am not a fan of squats and lunges.

Amy Dixon leads all segments. She cues well and is motivating.

For aerobics, I prefer the less intense low impact DVD  Lestlie Sansone's ""Walk Away The Pounds"". It too provides segmented workouts: 1, 2, 3, and 4 mile walks. Again you can go one or many of these segments. I like to mix it up to keep from getting bored.",1379894400,2,664,4.330645161290323
2887781,4,B000SM6FK4,"I love Amy, but the other girls moaning and screaming in delight can be a little distracting. Amy really makes you feel proud for the exercises you're doing and it also promotes a healthy lifestyle by giving you ten-minute exercises that you can fit into any schedule.

2887783,5,B000SM6FK4,"When I don't have time to do a full work out, this DVD is just right. This DVD has a couple more extra 10 min. workouts as well so you can switch it up in between for different days.",1360540800,,182,3.6923076923076925
2887784,3,B000SM6FK4,"If you have watched any Amy Dixon workout DVDs before, you know that she is high energy and creative with her workouts.  Total Workout in Ten has the same energy level, but some of the exercises are a bit dull and repetitive.  I find that I get bored with this DVD because there are very similar exercises scattered throughout (lots of lunges, for example).  It is fast paced and definitely requires you to work hard; Dixon does a great job motivating viewers and encouraging them (without coming across as superficial or annoying), but after watching it a handful of times, this workout DVD loses its luster.  It is still good when you are time crunched, but I don't know that I would suggest this as the best workout because it gets boring rather quickly.",1355356800,,757,4.626865671641791
2887785,5,B000SM6FK4,This is the perfect workout for the busy Mom.  It is a total body workout with a very motivating and inspirational trainer. I have had lots of fun with this one.,1353628800,,161,4.193548387096774
2887786,3,B000SM6FK4,"Amy Dixon is in great shape, and alot of her new tapes are very challenging. I think she drops the ball on this one. The cardio is for beginners, the leg segment is okay, but the arm segments if good. This tape is more so beginners-intermediate level.",1353110400,,251,4.361702127659575
2887787,5,B000SM6FK4,Amy Dixon is great in keeping you motivated in working out.  She breaks things down into ten minute set that makes it worth going on and on in your workout.,1351641600,,156,4.2
2887788,5,B000SM6FK4,It's intense but definitely makes you feel like you got a workout. I love Amy's style and wish she could be my personal trainer! I go through phases with this video but have had it for at least 5 years and still come back to it.,1347926400,3,228,3.9782608695652173
2887789,3,B000SM6FK4,"First of all, Amy Dixon is a great instructor. She gets right to the point and takes you to where you need to go with your workout, within 10 minutes for each segment. That is important to me and my lifestyle right now.

However, I feel the need to give a review because I was dumbfounded at the oddities I noticed with this production:

The noises were very distracting and unappealing. The other girls with Amy were cheering and groaning, as if they are extras in a play. It annoyed me, but I had to laugh because of how ridiculous they sounded. Also, the cameraman might have been doing some of the exercises too, because of the bouncing and strange movements from the camera. Some of the time, I had to look away, because it was making me feel dizzy. The workouts are fine and help achieve what they intend to achieve, but so far I cannot get past the strange behavior... I already have Amy's Give Me 10 DVD, and I will definitely buy the second: Give Me 10 More. They are the same type of workout, but without the drama; a much cleaner-looking set, controlled camera angles and no weird hooting from the ladies.

So I give it 3 stars, because if you want a good workout with 10 minute segments, spend the extra couple dollars and buy ""Amy Dixon's Give Me 10"" (or her second one). Same workout layout, but much better quality.

UPDATE: I have used this DVD for a few weeks now, and have learned to not focus on what bothered me. I like the DVD more,now and I feel bad for being negative in my previous review...I did want to say, I think the girl to Amy's right is on Bob Harper's kettle bell DVD. :)",1347667200,5,1604,4.301324503311259
2887790,5,B000SM6FK4,"I am always skeptical of another dvd to add to my collection.  However, this one has been added to my weekly rotation.  Most of the exercises are favorites from nearly 30 years of working out.  Amy's timing is nearly perfect and that is hard to find.  You can break it up in the well designed 10 minutes or roll right into the next segment.  Very well done. If you complete the entire workout and complete the flexibility and cooldown it is really worth your time.",1338768000,,464,4.411764705882353
2887791,5,B000SM6FK4,"When I could not get through the 10 minute ab routine on the ball, I knew I was on to something with this one.  I judge my fitness level by doing the 10 min ab routine -- if I can get through the whole 10 mins, I'm doing good!

I've been looking for something more intense, and went to the library and got some dance videos.  The first one was too complex.  The 2nd one was too jumpy.  So I grabbed my Total workout in ten and did the 2 cardio workouts, and that was JUST RIGHT!  Moves were not so complex that I got no workout, and not too jumpy that it destoyed my knees.  It may not be Turbo Jam, but you can get a workout from this video.",1337212800,,642,3.854961832061069
2887792,5,B000SM6FK4,"Love love love this workout!

It consists of four (cardio, lower body, upper body and balance/flexibility) 10 minute segments, so you can do the full 40 if you want, or just pick an area you want to work on.

What I like best is that I can never tell myself I don't have 10 minutes a day to exercise - so it takes away what is usually the excuse that stops me from getting started. And once I do the first 10 mins, I find I'm ready to do another 10. My goal is to work out every day and this DVD is helping me get there.

The only shortcoming is that it lacks an abs section but I have other DVDs if I want to work on that.",1335830400,,623,3.813953488372093

2887795,5,B000SM6FK4,"As an Amy Dixon dedicatee I found this older dvd from her days with Womens' Health and snapped it up!  It turns out to be one of my best moves yet cos this dvd rocks!!  It is quick and fun, with the same gals from Ultimate Fat Burner and an easier option to follow as well if needed.  The exercises have not dated and we found it a fun challenge and one to choose on a day where we are already beat and just want a quick and effective work-out.  This gets my vote!!",1318896000,,465,3.9148936170212765
2887796,5,B000SM6FK4,"My first Amy Dixon video was also a Women's Health video called Ultimate Fat Burn and I love her instruction & cueing, so I decided to give this one a try as well. I had a lot of fun the very first time, although each section is a TOUGH 10 minutes! One reviewer said that she wished there was a cooldown on this one. Amy includes a cool down section but it is called Balance & Flexibility training, and the beginning of it still keeps your heartrate up. As others have mentioned, Amy's not annoying to listen to as some other instructors definitely are. (Love ya Leslie Sansone & Denise Austin, but you're quite annoying!) I've gotten several other Amy Dixon DVD's - the ones put out by Stockyard Films - and they are really harder for me to follow. One thing that makes some harder is that I have carpeted floors and some moves just cannot be done properly (safely!) on carpeted surfaces. So far these two Women's Health DVD's of Amy's are my favorite ones. Maybe as I get the moves down on the others I'll enjoy them more. I think that it would be great if instructors came to realize that MOST of us don't like fancy footwork in our aerobic exercise routines. Many of us just aren't coordinated enough or simply don't want to learn a complicated routine. If somebody likes that type of work there is plenty of it out there in the dance workouts. You can keep aerobics do-able and still make it tough, keep it interesting, and keep people coming back for your next one!",1309737600,,1471,4.411764705882353

Total Workout in Ten with Amy Dixon (amazing instructor)proved very worthwhile.  You can do
the whole 40 minutes consecutively or break it down into 10 minute segments.  I always feel
energized in the end.  I even ordered for my 28 year old daughter (I'm a grandmother) and

2887802,5,B000SM6FK4,"Amy Dixon is brilliant! She's positive, encouraging, and never annoying. She doesn't have some weird accent that I find in many workout video hosts. She only loses count on reps once, for one rep. She explains the next step enough to perform it, and it is not hard to follow along.  Everything is done in real time, they don't speed up the moves to make it fit in ten minutes, and therefore make it impossible to follow along. Also, I like the girls in the background. They aren't annoying, or have fake smiles plastered on their faces. They look like they are truly enjoying the workout.

The format of this video is great, you can choose what ten minute segment you want to work on first. She has cardio, legs, arms, flexibility, and on the bonus part of the DVD, she has abs.

They're fun and great workouts (I recommend them!), but more dance-related and I'm not the most coordinated person in the world so it took me a few run-throughs of each to really get them down. The thing that makes this dvd marvelous is the cueing. Amy is a fun (but not annoying!) instructor and does a fantastic job of explaining the next set of moves and how you'll be doing them BEFORE you do them. I wasn't confused or lost once during this dvd. Not to say it isn't a challenge--I was really sweating and working through the entire thing!

I do wish there was a cool-down section, but that's my only gripe thus far. Also, some reviews stated that you couldn't get past the ads in the beginning. When I hit the 'forward-a-chapter' and then 'menu' buttons on my dvd remote, I completely bypassed them (this was on a 2-year-old sony dvd player). So it may just not play well with some dvd players.

She gets your heartrate up and then lowers it before you finish.  I'm over 50 and over weight so I think it's a good exercise video for everyone.,1257379200,,431,4.156626506024097
2887813,5,B000SM6FK4,"I like to rotate a variety of workout dvds to get a great daily workout in.

Even so, I am no pro at following instructors who are hard to follow or provide bad cueing. I'm not the most coordinated person and I am well aware of that!

No problems here. This dvd is truly one of my favorites. Not only is she one of the best I've seen at cueing and instruction, leaving my two left feet totally in sync and turning one of the lefts into a right, but it's just a great workout overall!

I'll touch on my own experience to help you make your decision:

Cueing: Rather than just jumping into something, while she's doing some step you've already learned, she will begin to explain what's to happen next. Then she always tells the viewer which direction you'll go...such as explaining how to do a a move just before you go into it then giving you a countdown and telling you whether to start out left or right. There is just never any confusion here and never a need to rewind. Total clarity for me.

Caloric Burn: That said, a workout that provides great cueing and instruction is no good to anyone if you don't scorch some calories doing it. I wear a bodybugg to show calories burned and, when I do just 20 minutes of this dvd, I burn as many calories as I do on some other 35 minute or longer videos. She packs a punch!! But I never feel like I'm gonna die or my heart rate is through the roof...it's just a good solid routine with no pauses and great strength and cardio conditioning so you burn calories instantly, then build muscle so you burn even more even at rest.

instructor: excellent motivator, great high energy, I'm a new raving fan and would be confident buying any of her future videos because the two I own are amazing with her in them.

set: cool urban loft. Nice to look at. No distractions, good views from many angles,..Also many others working out behind her to make following along easily as they pan...except for this:

camera: ok here's my one gripe. You can tell when the camerman is amazing but NOT used to shooting fitness videos. Because the quality is amazing but they go in for those closeups sometimes when you need to see the full body instead. (great in movies, not in following an instructors body that is on screen) For example, on one move the instructor starts a new step and the camerman focuses in on the person behind her who is doing the alternate easy step for beginners. By the time he pans back to the instructor, she is doing the LAST count of the higher intensity move. This wasn't enough to throw me off, but it's not ideal.

moves: as I said, nothing is hard to follow but she provides moves that are not only interesting, but not hard to do. You do not need a choreography degree for this one and you'll enjoy each one! :-) Even some new moves I hadn't seen before.

level: there is an alternate person behind the instructor for the beginners but intermediates and advanced will love their level being met as well.

CONCLUSION: You couldn't get a more solid workout...this one works every part you need, is enjoyable to do, and provides clear and easy instruction to do it in while burning the big calories! It's a favorite. If you want just one fitness dvd or 100, this should be a pick in my opinion.",1245888000,6,3248,4.387687188019966

2887816,5,B000SM6FK4,"I have to say, my first experience with a Women's Health workout was the Perfect Body Workout, and I thought it was pretty solid.  Having then tried the Ultimate fat Burn and now this DVD, I have to say that Amy Dixon knows exactly what she's doing, and am now totally impressed with these Women's Health workouts.

This video has four segments--cardio, lower body, upper body, and a flexibility workout.  All of them are about ten minites long, and you can pick and choose from if you don't have time for all of them.  I think all three are fantastic, especially for those of us that need a shorter but effective workout.

Here's the good:

--All the moves are DOABLE the first time; I had absolutely no problem following her moves.
--The moves that are done are effective; I was feeling the burn in no time.
--There's no wasted time in this video; there's no standing around between exercises like I have experienced in other videos, so your heart rate is up the entire time.
--The cueing is good; even if you're not sure what she means when she says the move, the moves are easy and you can pick them up right away.  I like the fact that she gives plenty of warning before she changes.
--I loved the fact that there was a separate flexibility segment that used yoga and stretching moves.  It felt great to do that after the segments using weights.

Things that could be improved:

--The workout calls for light weights (3 lbs), but I realized I needed more of a challenge.  I used 5- and 8-lb weights for the upper and lower body segments.

For a more advanced exerciser, this workout might be a little easy.  However, if you're like most people and want a workout that will kick your tail and give you some bonus flexibility, this is the workout for you.  Amy Dixon is one of the best DVD instructors I have come across, and I will definitely be on the lookout for any more workouts with her at the helm!",1239148800,2,1908,4.429799426934097

I have bought many many work out videos and I have a pet peeve about them -  when you have a cardio section you need to show the instructors legs. You don't need a close up of her face while she is instructing- you need to see what she is doing.

2887832,5,B000SM6FK4,"Get this video; you won't regret it!  It does what it says - you get a great workout in ten minutes.  Trust me, you will feel it.

I recently lost 30 pounds and decided it was time to start working out to keep stuff from ""hanging.""  I don't have a lot of time on my hands and even though I have other fitness videos that contain short workouts, I found them either too short to feel effective or too complicated for a virtual beginner like me.  I took a shot on this video and I'm so glad I did.  Amy Dixon is a great trainer - I think her directions are clear and easy to follow and she's funny and encouraging without being overly chatty or obnoxious (Denise Austin and Kathy Smith are good trainers but Denise yaps too much and Kathy tends to yell).  And the workouts themselves pretty much fly by - before you know it, you're done - but they make you work!  Last night I did Denise Austin's cardio dance for 20 minutes and broke a light sweat.  I did this video's upper and lower body sequences right after and was dripping sweat within the first three or four minutes.  I like the fact that Amy has someone with her that does the beginner modifications - this works great for anyone who doesn't quite have their balance yet or who, like me, has arthritis and can't always do all the movements as shown.

I absolutely love this video and recommend it highly to beginner and experienced exercisers alike.  Amy recommends starting with 3 pound weights but you can move up in poundage as you progress and get stronger.  As I said, Amy is great and I'd love to get her other videos but I'll need to work up to them.  The only thing I don't like about this video is the whooping and hollering by the ladies behind Amy - I find that extremely annoying but that's just me.  All in all, this is a great workout video!

2887833,5,B000SM6FK4,"This video is fabulous.  I've done it 3 times per week for 4 weeks and I already feel more toned and more energetic.  You don't need any special equipment, just roughly 50-60 square feet of carpeted space and two 3 pound weights.  In just over 40 minutes, you get a wonderful, comprehensive workout.  Amy Dixon is very likeable.  She is encouraging and enthusiastic without being overly bubbly and sweet.  The five women who join her on the video are fit, but clearly women who have real lives apart from working out and worrying about their abs.  The workout has four segments that you can do separately, or you can do all four in a row for a comprehensive workout.  The first segment is a fast paced cardio workout.  The second focuses on lower body.  The third focuses on upper body.  And the fourth is a combination of yoga and ballet moves that improve balance and flexibility and provide a cool down.  Many of the exercises throughout the workout also do agreat job on abs and waist.  I love doing all four segments in a row.  Everything is set to a simple dance beat, so it's easy to keep with the pace.  Many of the moves are downright fun.  A few were a bit challenging the first time, but they are easy to learn after a few times through.  One of the women on the video does modified versions of some of the moves that require a bit extra strength, balance or flexibility.  I am in my mid-40s, a mom, and a full time professional.  So I can't commit to long workouts at pre-set times.  I was thrilled to find an at-home workout that gets my heart rate up for 40 minutes, works on all the muscles in my body and is (amazingly!) so fun that I look forward to it.  Thank you Amy Dixon and Women's Health.

NOTE 5 MONTHS LATER:  After a few weeks, I only had time to workout on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  But that was enough.  I lost 9 pounds without eating differently, though I look as though I lost more because I replaced fat with muscle.  I dropped a full dress size.

I have two 10 pound weights instead. If you desire to do more then 10 minutes you can always replay the routine or move on to another routine that focuses on another part of the body. I am not extremely overweight. I just have 10-15 lbs that I would like to shed and I also desire to tone up and this dvd is perfect. Also, the lady that directs the workouts isn't annoying at all and there's nothing cheesy about the workouts or the people in the dvd....like many workouts out there that tend to look really ridiculous and outdated.

I also really like Amy because she keeps you motivated. If you are considering this video please buy it. You will not be dissapointed.,1206662400,,285,4.107142857142857

2887843,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is my second Amy Dixon video and I love this one even more than the other one.  This video really makes you sweat, it's a great overall body toner with cardio.  I just wish the lower body section were longer.  I found doing the core section of the tape you don't need the ball.  I just do it on the floor and you still get a great workout.  I recommend this video.",1206057600,,369,4.0
2887844,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is a great workout - another good one from Women's Health. I first bought Amy Dixon's Ultimate Fat Burn and loved that so much that I bought this one! This workout is great as a total body toner or when you only have time to do one or two segments. There are four altogether, cardio, lower body, upper body and flexibility. I often do all four and then do one more cardio blast or do another workout DVD and then add on a segment from this one for extra burn. The cardio segment really gets your heart moving and your body going! I love the arm exercises too. I went up to 5 lb weights instead of the 3 lb ones that they recommend. I like how easy the moves are - nothing is worse than something so complicated you can't follow along and again, Amy is a great instructor! Thanks Women's Health!",1205366400,,799,4.194805194805195

This girl means business! I do TaeBo, Pilates and Yoga all the time, and i'm in pretty good condition... i thought... but it wasn't until i did this workout when i found out i was WRONG! This girl proved me wrong! I kept on saying ""she is crazy!"" the entire time i was doing the workout. If you never break a sweat, loose your breath and feel like you won't quit, you WILL!!!!

2887846,5,B000SM6FK4,"Is Amy Dixon amazing or what? I was so impressed with this DVD! I love that I have the option to do a quick cardio workout in ten minutes. Some days you just don't have time and this is perfect for that. I love the lower and upper body workouts, I feel like they really do the trick. I'm starting to see great definition in my arms that I haven't seen in years. I actually find myself admiring my arms after this workout! She has done amazing things for my arms and thighs!! I usually do the full workout, cardio, lower body, upper body and balance. I have to say the balance is my least favorite section, its very repetitive and a tad boring after you have powered through the whole workout. I do alternate this video with Tae Bo Fat Blasting Cardio, because I feel like I need more cardio then this video provides. I see this dvd as my ""fun and easy"" workout. I like Tae Bo for the hardcore intense cardio workouts and I like this dvd for the focus on toning and strength training with a good dose of cardio. This gets my heart going and Amy is fantastic. She is fun, easy going and easy to deal with day in and day out. She does all the workouts with you, (yeah you Billy Blanks!! slacking off!) I would prefer all my workouts to be lead by her!! She is inspiring and encouraging!! I love her! I want to buy all her dvd's now! I wish I could take her class in person! She is AWESOME!",1204156800,2,1386,4.137037037037037
2887847,5,B000SM6FK4,"What an amazing work-out.  I thought it was too good to be true to work-out for only 10 minutes, but that 10 minutes is INTENSE!  You feel good about yourself, she is extremely motivating, and it only takes 10 minutes!  AND, if you want a longer work-out, there are 4 others to choose from, so just keep going!  Highly recommended.",1203638400,4,331,4.466666666666667
2887848,5,B000SM6FK4,I have tried many at home workout dvds and have been too bored to repeat the workout.  This one is AWESOME!  I found myself having fun and the workout went by quickly even though I was sweating and was sore the next day.  It is great because you can do just 10 minutes of any workout or do the whole thing.  The istructor is great too.  I love this!!!!!!,1203552000,9,354,4.072463768115942
2887849,4,B000SM6FK4,"If you currently have WH Ultimate Fat Burn and are worried that Total Workout in 10 is the same workout, it's not. The routines and combinations are diverse enough that you're not following the same workout on a different DVD. I like the fact that you have the option of doing 4 ten minute segments or one pre-built workout that combines all four routines. It's lots of fun and not too difficult, so I recommend it to people who are just starting to workout. The flexibility segment incorporates a few yoga moves which I really like. And there is also an abdominal routine as a bonus segment, but you need a stability ball. I consider myself as having an intermediate fitness level, so the only downside is that I don't feel 10 minutes is really enough time to get a good workout. So I'm probably only going to recommend the per-built workout which guides you through all 4 routines as one workout.",1202860800,,898,4.549382716049383
2887850,5,B000SM6FK4,It is very easy to follow the instructor. She is fun and energetic. I can not stop beaming after starting her video. I love the camera work.

2887851,5,B000SM6FK4,"I love this video!  Mostly because I love the instructor!  She has a great attitude and is enthusiastic and encouraging without being annoying.  This video has 5 10 minutes workouts: cardio, upper body toning, lower body toning, core toning on a ball, and a stretch section.  (I believe one of these workouts, either stretch or core, is listed as a ""bonus"" segment).  The workout is moderate, not too tough, but enough to get your heart rate up and feel like you've accomplished something.  Great video!",1202688000,2,503,4.858823529411764
2887852,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is a nice workout video.  It's 10 minutes of four different kinds of focuses; cardio, upper-body, lower-body and flexibility.  It's nice because you can switch it up, and do two on one day, or all four on another.  Each one gets you sweating, and the movements are pretty easy.  She does go a little fast, but I just slowed down and took it at my own pace.",1202428800,,361,4.264705882352941
2887853,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is my 2nd Amy Dixon workout video (I also have Ultimate Fat Burn) and I love them both. I like that you can do a pre-set program or chose from the 10-minute routines. Lately I have been working my lower body on my own, then popping in the DVD for upper body and core work. The core workout is rather hidden on the Bonus menu, but it an awesome routine - probably the best core workout I have done. I mix up the weights I use depending on the move - it is easy to adjust for any fitness level.",1202256000,,497,3.9306930693069306
2887854,5,B000SM6FK4,"I've been working out at the gym for a month now but decided to buy a DVD for days I don't feel like going to the gym.  I was a little concerned because I have a bad knee and back so I am always careful about how I exercise.  Amy Dixon's video has Beth doing modified versions of exercises that even I could do.  The first time I did the video I did the custom built exercises got thru 10 minutes definitely feeling it was a workout, I never made it thru the entire second 10 minutes because I was too tired.  Even with Amy's motivation, I knew I just have to build up more stamina.  A great video that is easy for all fitness levels - and if you really can't take more exercise, just turn it off and cool down.  One day, I'll get thru all four at once.",1201996800,5,753,3.9536423841059603

2887856,5,B000SM6FK4,I love it!  I have little time during the day to get my workout in and this works out perfect.  Amy Dixon is awesome.  She gets your heart rate up right away and keeps it there the whole time.  This is by far the most effective workout DVD I have every tried.  When I tried it for the first time I hurt all over for days after...it hurt so good!  I'd recommend anything you can find out there by Amy Dixon!!!,1201392000,,408,3.9753086419753085

2887859,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is one of the best workouts I've purchased in a while.  Amy is a great instructor and gives excellent cueing through out the workout.  You start off with a cardio section that gets the heart pumping.  This is a nice segment using simple to follow moves that are still challenging.  The next section is lower body and you get a nice variation that challenges your large muscle groups.  The following segment is upper body and this moves quickly but is very effective in getting in a great 10 minute segment to challenge your upper body.  The last segment is balance and stretch and this is my favorite.  She uses yoga moves that are doable and still a challenge, you feel it and know you are getting a great stretch in.  The bonus ab segment is just as great and all total this is a great 50 minute workout to do as a whole.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice balanced workout.",1200787200,8,906,4.377245508982036

2887861,5,B000SM6FK4,"This was my first Women's Health workout DVD I've used. I also ordered Train for Your Body Type and The Wedding Workout, but haven't used them yet. I decided to give this one a go first, since the split up workouts seemed promising since I have limited time to workout. Boy, was I glad I did! This is an EXCELLENT DVD. First off, you can either do one section for concentrated training, or you can do all the sections and get a total (and I mean total!) body workout.

First off the cardio section was amazing. It was hard, but it was also fun and Amy Dixon is a great instructor. She had me begging for mercy about 4-5 minutes in, but she encouraged me to ""keep going, it's only 10 minutes!""

The lower body section clocked in at just under 8 minutes, but you WILL feel it. Amy has you doing a series of lunges, curtsey lunges, and deadlifts with lunges. VERY effective and the pace moves quickly and the moves are compact. Right off, you can feel the muscles you're working.

The upper body section was UNBELIEVABLE. I was dying--in a good way. And the day after I was sore. She does a bunch of great variations on the usual shoulder exercises, bicep curls, triceps and an awesome pushup variation that I love and you won't dread doing, yet is effective as well.

The flexibility workout is great as well, and Amy reminds you that this is not a wasted workout--you're still burning calories, which was encouraging as well.

All in all, this was a great DVD that I probably won't use everyday but I will use when I want a total body workout in less than 40 mins., or on days when I want to concentrate on certain areas of the body. I've never heard of Amy Dixon before but now that I have, I will definitely be buying more of her DVDs. Her cueing is great, she's funny and makes come comical remarks and is not overly peppy or obnoxious.

Great DVD, if you buy it, you WILL be using it again and again!",1199836800,119,1903,4.301675977653631
2887862,5,B000SM6FK4,"This is the third Women's Health workout DVD I've borrowed from the library. I have to say, I wasn't too impressed with either The Wedding Workout or Train for Your Body Type, but I loved this DVD. I'm definitely going to buy this one, and will probably throw in her other Women's Health DVD, Ultimate Fat Burn, as well.

Amy Dixon is a great instructor who cues well and is encouraging without being annoying. Plus, it's a really great workout! I did all 4 10-minute segments together, and it was a really well rounded routine. I'm definitely a bit sore today (especially in the shoulders!). My favorite segment is probably the balance/flexibility cooldown at the end--it's very relaxing with some great yoga/pilates-inspired movements. What a great way to end a workout!

I'd definitely recommend trying this out, even if you weren't a fan of the other Women's Health DVDs.",1199232000,55,875,4.865771812080537
