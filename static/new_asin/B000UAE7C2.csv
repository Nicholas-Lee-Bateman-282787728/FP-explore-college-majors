8212703,5,B000UAE7C2,"Google and find Roger Ebert's original review of this film so you can really get the mood of Three Days of Rain. It is a sad, lonely film with a gorgeous soundtrack lifted from a noir film. Snapshots of lives, without necessarily an 'ending'....in other words: just like real lives. I loved this film. And if you are the kind of person described in the Ebert interview who loves film, you will, too.",1378080000,,399,4.47945205479452
8212704,5,B000UAE7C2,"As a previous poster stated, there are no car chases here - no burning vehicles careening off cliffs, no bombs exploding, no cheap nudity, only a bit of off-color language (and it is used like real people use it) - in short, none of the usual crap that is regularly vomited forth by Hollywood.

This ""indie"" is a fascinating series of vignettes about ordinary people in the ordinary setting of Cleveland during a ordinary three day rain.  The director cuts back and forth with skill and all is highlighted by a compelling jazz musical background.  The actors really seem like real people - and I guess that's the highest compliment you can make.  In fact, the ""ordinary"" ambiance of the film is what makes it so extraordinary.

Hollywood, on it's best day, seldom makes a film this good.",1302652800,,787,4.673913043478261
8212705,4,B000UAE7C2,"Life is not always beautiful, and this movie is about as close to real life as people can stand to watch when they aren't personally involved. Is there perfect closure to the story lines? No, but I think they do have a certain 'the sun has risen on a brand new day' kind of feeling. Not that the new day will be perfect, but that life continues, and we are stronger for having lived through the bad times.",1301875200,,405,4.205128205128205
8212706,5,B000UAE7C2,"Hmmm, my impression of Three Days of Rain is significantly different (and more positive) than most people.  Actually, I'm surprised only three people have reviewed this film here on amazon.  It seems like the kind of movie that should have become more popular.

I really loved what the writers were going for here- take a variety of storylines involving completely different people living in Cleveland, reveal to us their own personal problems and situations, let the story unravel slowly while allowing the viewers to ""expect the unexpected"", and don't expect *too* much of a brilliant ending.

I personally didn't mind the ending one bit.  Yes, it could have been better, but who knows, maybe that's just my expectations being set too high- maybe all along the writers wanted to deliver something relatively simple and down to earth.  After all, the rest of the film was simple and down to earth, why should the ending be any different?

Yes, there was really only one dramatic moment (which another reviewer had to go and spoil, unfortunately) and that was a VERY shocking moment indeed.  The pace and relative calmness the entire movie had going up to this point did NOT prepare me for that disturbing moment involving a mother and a baby.

Another storyline, such as a husband and his wife arguing over whether they should have given food to a homeless man, were pretty good moments of storytelling.  It really made me question what *I* would have done in that situation for example, and how I would have felt about it had I turned the guy down and just walked away.

The storyline involving a mentally challenged man working for his railroad company was very interesting.  I think people are looking into the conclusion of this particular storyline a little deeper than necessary.  I'm satisfied with how it was wrapped up.

The other one involving a taxi driver was interesting because there were a couple different ways to interpret his behavior without revealing too much.  The storyline involving a man who experiences a leaky roof and has an encounter with his neighbor surprised me in a BIG way by winning me over with its conclusion, making my interest in this segment go up dramatically.  I was NOT expecting what happened at the end.

Overall, this is a quality film.  I don't get all the hate to be honest.",1271635200,5,2322,4.806045340050378
8212707,5,B000UAE7C2,"Could this be one of the most beautiful films ever made? Although it is not perhaps the kind of beauty that most people would want to see, nor even expect could possibly exist, as it usually escapes our attention. What happens here is stolen from the life of what passes us by. There are human figures in a landscape, cryptic and alienated, but also a supreme sense of presence: a physical realm which transcends the mere possibility of metaphorically registering the human condition. This is a revelation of the beauty of the world, the universe actually, just as it happens, as it appears.

In this realm of experience Sharunas Bartas renders in Three Days, there is a beauty of surfaces and distances, an endless sense of moment, the space characters occupy before moving on, the way light immerses everything in its shifting and waning powers, manifesting a landscape apparently out of nothingness, a nothingness which seems to persist when place and beings are subsumed into the atmospheric field, endlessly holding our gaze. A deepening dimension of silence reveals a startling lucidity of forms and sounds, especially effective as seen and heard through distance. All of which tentatively define time as it arises, and a place which keeps taking place. Although our gaze continually moves between figure and background, our attention is occasionally suspended in moments of emotive mystery: Why is she suddenly laughing? Or crying? Thus Katerina Golubeva haunts us as well.

The conventional modes of narrative, dialogue and exposition used by popular forms of cinema have created a systemic refuge of meaning for us, heavily conditioning our belief that what passes as storytelling is actually a direct way into knowing who we are, rather than a continued shared desire to conform our behaviors predictably into acceptable cultures. Thus storytelling has become a highly cultivated way of transmitting un-truths. Bartas radically exposes this mythology of culture in creating his profoundly mysterious cinema, not because he withholds information from us, but simply because he suggests an impossibility of truly knowing others on deeper levels (an insight also registered in some films by Claire Denis and Chantal Akerman). Apparently unavailable are these private lives before us, their pain barely surfacing to negotiate an entropic numbness.

However, an ability (in fact the very invitation to the viewer) to bear witness, is quite important here. In the feeling of being present there, in a room with the woman and man, there is no sense of voyeurism merely because we are given access to their private moments: as they lay on the bed, fully clothed, without speaking, she holding him against herself, gently stroking his hair, his face hidden in her coat, the dance-hall music from across the way distant but audible, her tears visible as she begins to cry silently. What registers is highly unusual: instead of empathy because you might understand why she's crying (you actually might not), the moment involves being present to witness her distress, without even knowing why, and only because you have been given special permission to do so, which has become clear. Through this act of grace, Bartas allows us to bear witness to these lives without the need to ""own"" the experience through having one's subjectivity excercised, which enables a witnessing so eminently humanizing. In fact, it seems an ethical subversion of the usual effects of emotional pornography characteristic of so much common cinematic manipulation, wherein a typical excess of information ""gets us going.""

There are moments when these human figures we encounter almost emerge as full-fledged subjects, before disappearing again into their maintained silence. Mostly speechless, they drift along or meet up, amble together for a while, through rooms, into encounters without welcome or conclusion. The drifting itself evokes a wayward miasma: there seems to be nothing to do but gradually move, entering buildings through windows, turning around when gates are closed, living outside possibilities of comfort, standing here and there, standing some more before moving on again.

Yet the realm they inhabit and pass through - this supreme transience of presence, seemingly containing everything, full of subtle contingencies - becomes an aesthetic one unsurpassed by alienation, and one which has steadily encompassed our feeling, not just our witness. And so what is made available finally, one of the film's true gifts, is a newly possible vision: Is this after all nothing less than the life - of the whole world - which we are witnessing?",1260489600,3,4631,5.2527027027027025
8212708,1,B000UAE7C2,"Make no mistake about it. The acting is superb.
  But that's it folks.
  The various storylines cry for some sort of viable resolution or at least the very hope of one. The viewer is jilted into expecting something that ties everything together or has some symbolic gesture that justifies 90 minutes of character development.
  Everyone, at one time or another, digs a hole for himself or herself. To display this as how the hole can be dug deeper, with no hope of salvation, is despicable.
  Too bad.",1191801600,,501,4.67816091954023
8212709,4,B000UAE7C2,"Terrific ensemble type film with four stories overlapping.  Loved Peter Falk as the old drunk.  A role he has waited his entire life to play.  Also, the story about the girl watching her own baby is heart breaking to say the least.",1187654400,2,231,4.4523809523809526
