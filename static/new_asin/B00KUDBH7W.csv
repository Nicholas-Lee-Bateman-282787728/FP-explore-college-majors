8661757,5,B00KUDBH7W,"It's an epic movie, the Gurren Lagann movie collection is an extended version of the series of the same name. It has all of the action, and none of the filler episodes. With  more epic moments and manly lines, I definitely loved this movie collection I highly recommend it.",1478217600,,273,4.571428571428571

8661760,5,B00KUDBH7W,"The original series is the most epic and over-the-top thing I had ever seen. I went into these movies thinking that they would just be recaps, highlighting the best parts and skipping over the boring ones etc. I figured nothing unexpected would happen, because it couldn't get any more ridiculous than it already was. MAN WAS I WRONG. Even more escalation, bigger transformations, crazier amounts of power, I couldn't believe my eyes. Then the most insane part happened. As I sat there in disbelief, Kamina burst out of the screen, punched me in the face, stared into my soul and said, ""Do the impossible"". This is the awesomest thing you will ever watch, just remember to clench those teeth!",1420588800,19,692,4.823529411764706
