8352104,3,B00266921O,"This is a good family movie with a wonderful Christian message that there is life after death.  The acting in this movie in my opinion is very amateurish.  But when the younger brother ""meets"" his brother who had recently died in a car accident, tugs at the heart strings.  I heartily recommend this movie.",1305244800,,306,4.62962962962963
