1356621,5,B00004UEEM,"This is a film about cycling, but more importantly, about TIME.  The critical two seconds stretch out for what seems much longer, and then there are moments in the film in which time literally stands still.  Others when it rushes on.  For the protagonist, speed is one way to slow time.
But it's not the only way...
The 'competition' is hilarious.  As is the shopowner's reaction to the protagonist's first request.",982972800,6,415,4.802816901408451
1356622,4,B00004UEEM,"The title pretty much says it all!
Charlotte Laurier plays a professional downhill mountain bike racer who hesitates by two seconds just before starting the biggest race of her life ... and loses by that very same two seconds. After being fired by her team, she returns to her native Montreal and gets a job as a bike messenger.
Needing service one evening, she discovers a small shop owned by a cranky Italian former professional road bike racer (and now master mechanic).
The two clash at first, but over time grow to understand one another. The classic scene is when the two hold a competition of sorts ... what about? You'll just have to watch the film to find out.",974246400,14,669,4.583333333333333

7923969,3,B00004UEEM,"The main character, is a hard driven MTB downhill racer, which means super professional, super concentrated, super committed to the sport and to bicycle riding, to the point, where, bicycling becomes your whole way of life, right! Later in the film, she speaks of the degree of bicycling she partook in being so all encompassing that it was even more to her than relationships and even affected sexual contact with men (with a twist at the end - I'll have more to say on that later).

So, there she is at the start, got a gray hair, is thinking about her age and mortality, gets into a zone at the start of a race resulting in a late start, and gets kicked off the team, only to move home and in with her brother. Oh, yeah, and the team let's her keep one of her MTBs.

Then, she gets a moment of sheer clarity of thought, and realizes that if she becomes a bike messenger she will have the best of both worlds, that is until she has to deal with dispatchers, disgruntled other messengers (especially the one in a car instead of a bike), and the garbage bike messengers put up with from the customers that use bike messenger services.

Oh yeah, and she meets a mythic road bike shop owner. The two of them transcend bicycle riding, but that is a whole story in and of itself that I won't go into in this review.

The issue I had with this film is it appears to want to cater to the bike messenger cult but ignores the knowledge that anyone who moves within that cult has. First off she is trying to bike messenger on her full suspension race MTB, and, doesn't know that thinner wheels are faster? From the looks of the other bikes the rest of the bike messengers are riding it appears none of them do either. There are almost no road bikes in this movie and I don't think I ever spotted a single speed or fixed gear bike either.

At the end she joins what looks like an alley cat only it is during the day and no one looks like they are pedaling all out or with any expectation of trying to win.

I know I promised I would have more to say about the twist at the end but I won't divulge what it is. You'll have to sit through the film like my wife and I did if you are interested in knowing what it is.

One good thing about this film is that my wife actually enjoyed watching it which isn't the normal experience she has watching bike related films.

Another good thing was some of the humorous moments, like how the main character often got in the zone and forgot to stop and make a delivery.",1394150400,,2494,4.202928870292887
7923970,5,B00004UEEM,"Yes, the stars are a young woman and an oder man,  Yes there are Engish sub-titles.  But this movie has a story and a heart.  The way a movie is supposed to be.  Music is very good too (found out ending music is ""Deowarfe"" by MULU).",1346544000,,232,3.9782608695652173

7923972,4,B00004UEEM,I you have time a would like to watch a feel good cycling movie then this one is for you. I did not have very high expectations of this movie but it was a nice watch with some great footage of some down hilling.,1266019200,3,211,3.8181818181818183
7923973,3,B00004UEEM,"I read reviews for this film so purchased it thinking it was going to be a stimulating cycling film.  It was tedious and predictable with the opening so boring if I was in a movie theatre I would have left.  Further, there was too much uninteresting English dialogue.  I don't understand why people want to make films so ennuyant.",1253577600,,330,4.559322033898305
7923974,5,B00004UEEM,"This is a real good character driven movie about a cyclist and their passion for cycling.  It's funny, witty, and entertaining at that. For those who appreciate stories about cycling this is one of them.",1207267200,2,203,4.8
7923975,5,B00004UEEM,"Two of my most beloved joys: mountain biking and French films!  Those of us who ride understand the amazing relativity of time, especially on the bike.  Not only does the movie truly capture many of the very ""in"" concepts of the sport, but it also addresses the concept of how many of us are closing off our hearts by throwing ourselves so fully into an activity.  Riding is great!  Love is better.",1056412800,9,398,4.486111111111111
7923976,4,B00004UEEM,"I saw this movie about a year ago, so I'm a little fuzzy on details.  Anyway, it's about this young woman who loses her competitive edge in mountain biking and ends up retiring.  Still, she can't give up biking and finds a new way to earn a living.  The story is fun and uplifting, and the two main characters are both well portrayed.  You don't have to be into mountain biking to appreciate this movie - there's plenty of looks into the biker sub-culture.  In a way, you learn about it as the main character learns.  Plenty of good laughs, too.  Also, i love subtitled movies - some of the translations crack me up.  Definitely worth checking out if you read through my whole review.",1007164800,6,684,4.416
7923977,4,B00004UEEM,"In this obviously low budget film there is far superior entertainment than most bloated big spending blockbusters. Though the main character's life is unfocused at first, the story is very carefully pieced together. While bicycle racing is used as the main plot sevice, the theme applies to anybody who has a goal in life and wants to succeed. The characters are all very real, even the bicycle store proprieter who could seem a bit mythic. I thoroughly enjoyed this clever movie, and I suspect anybody who dreams about improving their life will too.",990921600,15,550,4.924731182795699
