2839025,1,B000QH0Z84,"Susan Powter lost so much weight because she replaced eating with talking.  She talks about relaxing while stretching to get the best benefits, but you can't relax because she talks too much during this DVD.  And her talking is not helpful guidelines it's just filler sentences.

Unless you are very new to exercise or have never stretched in your life I do not recommend this DVD.  This is about as beginner as it gets with very, very basic yoga poses.  Her modification for some moves is to just not do it (which is ridiculous coming from a 'fitness expert.') Almost all the moves are focused on the legs.  The rest of the body (arms,back,wrists,neck) is completely neglected.  Additionally in my opinion, she doesn't hold the stretches long enough to be very effective.",1318464000,9,772,4.803030303030303
2839026,5,B000QH0Z84,"I did this video after walking a brisk mile and it was so relaxing, yet it worked my muscles. I'm sore today from all the stretching, but it's a good sore. She is very calm throughout the video and you can tell she is enjoying herself. She has such compassion for people who struggle with their weight. I've always loved her.",1302480000,5,325,4.344262295081967
2839027,5,B000QH0Z84,"This is one of the most thorough stretches I own.  I would classify myself as an ""advanced beginner"", if that makes any sense, and before doing this I had never realized how increadibly tight my hip flexors were.  This dvd REALLY helped me to address this issue, which corrected my posture and form - VERY important if you want to benefit from any future workout.  Now I feel my body working more efficiently and actually progressing with other workouts as well.  Who knew?",1299456000,6,473,4.662650602409639
2839028,5,B000QH0Z84,"For some reason I am just not strong enough or limber enough to do this one for very long. But, my cat seems to follow it quite well. If you already do yoga or pliate's or Tai Chi then it is great.",1294963200,4,197,3.7142857142857144
2839029,5,B000QH0Z84,"Susan is so very clear about the moves, you don't have to worry about watching her to follow the routine. Plus, it makes you feel so good and energized when your done. Not high impact  or impossible stretches,as she also shows steps in moderation. I highly recommend this dvd for those who want to just stretch and strengthen your muscles.",1282694400,3,339,4.65
2839030,4,B000QH0Z84,Sorry it took so long to write but it was awhile before I could use the DVD. At first I didn't think I was going to like the footage mainly because it felt to yoga like but it helped me with some of my back pain & leg pain. So I really do like it now & have used it several times. Thanks,1273968000,2,287,3.5714285714285716
2839031,5,B000QH0Z84,This is a great stretch DVD. I felt more relaxed afterwards. Susan has a nice voice & that helps. I enjoyed This DVD.,1252281600,,117,4.130434782608695
2839032,5,B000QH0Z84,"I love this! When I use this DVD, I am NEVER sore after my cardio program.  I am more limber, my back feels better, and despite up to 4 miles of walking/jogging, my calves don't hurt.  I can't recommend this highly enough",1186012800,37,221,4.238095238095238

8196451,2,B000QH0Z84,"I struggled with rating this. First off, the stretches are pretty basic (if requiring a good deal of flexibility), and there are actually not that many stretches to be shown. The first stretch has Susan sitting on the floor, hips over her ankles, which if you are anywhere moderately overweight, this particular stretch might not even be doable for you. She then proceeds to sit on the floor in this stretch for what seemed like 2 minutes straight, blabbering about who knows what. This was not an introduction, she legit wanted you to sit on the floor in this position for this extended period of time. The remaining stretches she also holds for quite a while, but not as long as that first stretch. I do not understand why she included that first stretch right off the bat, and why she held it for so dang long...? Back in the day, when I was far more fit and flexible (I am 45 y/o) and could legit do that stretch, there is no way in heck I would have held it as long as she did. I could see actual injury there, possibly even if you are somewhat fit. She is obviously fit and flexible, so she CAN hold that particular one forever, if she wanted.

Basically these have very minimal amount of stretches, and while she is her usual informative self and can be motivating, this video I think, will be very awkward, unless you are already somewhat fit and/or already quite flexible. If you are a legit beginner with more than say 50 lbs to lose, these 'stretches' may actually do you more harm than good (if impossible to do) that is if you are flexible enough to do them.

I am a bit disappointed in this because to me, Susan always seemed more geared toward newbies and beginner exercisers, and she always offered easier alternatives if you could not do a particular move. I do not see any of that in this video. I did give it 2 stars as opposed to less than what I feel it deserves (1-star), because if you ARE somewhat fit and/or flexible, this video light be good for you (again, even if the actual exercises are very limited)...

All in all I would say there are better stretch exercises out there. I typically love and appreciate Susan's videos and teachings and motivation, but to me she missed the mark on this one. It is almost like she was going for a yoga video, but with very small amounts of actual movements. Disappointed in this video. Also sidenote, very ugly background. Almost distracting. Trivial, I know, but..mehh!",1444003200,,2435,4.47972972972973

8196454,4,B000QH0Z84,"This is a very good dvd to work out with great easy stretches , I found that it runs a little shorter than I like so I must continue after it is completed.
I have many of her dvds and always enjoy the work out.",1383782400,,210,3.688888888888889
8196455,5,B000QH0Z84,"I have been using this for 3 months and do not think I could get through my day without it. I have done every day since receiving it and love it. I look at Susan and think ""no-way"" but I am making slow and easy progress. Will never be that limber and do not expect to be but after being on my feet all day every day this helps my aching joints. Am so glad I ordered and have been recommending to friends. As you age those joints need stretched or you lose them. Thank you Susan again for coming to my rescue.

8196456,5,B000QH0Z84,Great stretching exercises for beginners to fitness or someone who has been off their fitness routine for a while. The instructions and pace are perfect. Wish she would put her Building Strength VHS on DVD.,1373932800,,206,4.914285714285715
8196457,1,B000QH0Z84,"If you are not already in good shape you will not be able to use these DVD fitness videos. Susan has forgotten what it was like to be out of shape physically and overweight. Really Susan needs to put her old VHS tapes on DVD. As far as helping a person to modify a stretch, forget it, it never really happened.",1371427200,4,310,4.098360655737705
8196458,2,B000QH0Z84,"There's something crazy yet motivating  about Powter.  However, she should have put all her talking into a separate section on the DVD.  When I'm working out, I want the routine to flow and don't want a bunch of talking that interrupts the routine and that I'll have to listen to over and over whenever I put the DVD in.  A little less talking and a lot more stretching is needed here.",1361059200,7,385,4.380281690140845
8196459,5,B000QH0Z84,"I remember the 'crazy' (I say that with love Susan!) Susan with the cropped hair & loud mouth (again, with love!) that my mom used to exercise to.  Flash forward a decade or more and here she is with a new look and new DVD's...YAY!  In an attempt to get my mom to ""move"" I purchased this DVD based on its reviews and WE aren't disappointed!  I love that she reminds people that she couldn't always do some of the moves and shows alternative movements and encourages people that with practice they too will be able to do it.  It gives people hope that if they pursue a healthy lifestyle that they too will be able to do the simplest of things that look so easy but when you're overweight aren't...like to sit up straight or Indian style.  Bravo to her empathy! I'm glad that Susan puts everything in perspective.  It's almost as though she's welcomed you into her living room (the inside of Jeannie's bottle!) and she's an old friend (which she kinda is for us!) and she's inviting you to just ""chill out"" and stretch with her...she's so real.  This is a DVD that I love to do in between workout days and sometimes on workout days and sometimes after a rough day at work just to calm my nerves!  And surprisingly...mom has stuck with her!  She had commented that she didn't realize how ""tight"" she was until she did this DVD!  It motivated her to ""MOVE""!  So for that Susan, I'm SO grateful!  Thank you for a DVD for everyone!  Now will you please do a good STEP workout?!  Thank you! ;)",1329523200,20,1486,4.356363636363636
