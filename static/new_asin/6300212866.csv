7805276,5,6300212866,"I don't understand why the other reviewer's so butthurt, but I actually liked this movie. I'd been wanting to see this for some time. I won a copy in an eBay auction and it came rather fast. I watched it, and it was pretty good. I especially liked the score by Tangerine Dream, but more on that later. Now onto the movie.

The movie is about a cop named Paul (Played by Paul Coufos) who is currently investigating the crimes of a child predator named Garrett (Played by the writer/producer Damian Lee), but little does he know that Paul and Garrett are related. The movie starts off with Paul and his partner Rosie (Played by Tony Rosato from SCTV and Damian's previous Busted Up) on a stakeout. They're waiting for a henchman of Garrett, who eventually gets shot by Garrett himself. Meanwhile, Joey, the young son of Paul's girlfriend, Maria (Played by Sonja Belliveau from Lee's Circle Man) almost gets kidnapped, only to get kidnapped for real later in the movie.

I would rather not give too much away, but I will say that probably the best character in the movie is the character of Sergeant Fireman (Played by screen vet John P. Ryan from classics such as It's Alive and Class of 1999.) The score by Tangerine Dream is very well done and atmospheric, and I especially like the song at the end. I even made myself an mp3 of it. As for the direction, I think David Mitchell did a decent job. This movie, like most of Damian's films, has not received a DVD release, so if you can find a VHS copy for cheap, then get it.

Highly recommended.

EXTRAS: Aside from the song and the Cineplex Odeon Logo, nothing much. No trailers, which is actually pretty surprising since so far, every Cineplex Odeon tape I own has no trailers on them.",1231459200,2,1735,4.498412698412698
7805277,1,6300212866,"There is very little of interest to be discovered in this basically mindless Canadian production, technically a science-fictional tale set in a future large and dystopic city, wherein no sympathy can be readily found for any of the principal characters.  We know that the city is a dystopia due to an active smoke machine that emits its murky product throughout the affair, and there are also small fires burning in alleys of what is in reality an industrial district of Toronto.  Coherence is totally neglected within a plot that revolves about a police officer, Paul (Paul Coufos) who, along with his partner, is trying to locate a suspect in their ""precinct"" busily engaged in kidnapping young boys (12 thus far), and killing at least one of them.  The villain, named Garrett, played by Damian Lee who also produces here and cobbles together the screenplay, is in fact found, proving to be in some fashion related to Paul by blood, with both men being manipulated in a mystical manner by a mysterious old man, but because Paul's character lacks any form of appeal, it is difficult to be concerned about what may happen to any of them.  To develop a menacing aspect for a rather bland Garrett, the scenario has the latter kidnap the young son of Paul's girl friend, following which are the to be expected sequences depicting a clash of temperaments between varying ranks of police personnel, including the obligatory suspension of the rogue cop hero, in a work shot largely with video tape.  Coufos poses rather than acts, although he is given free rein to violently chew scenery during several scenes, while most of the other players merely walk through their weakly written roles, not aided by tepid direction.  The film is lightly budgeted, but not to an extent as to preclude effective building of sets; utilization of automobiles from the 1970s provides a particularly jarring note, as do other design shortcomings that fail to manifest a futuristic mise en scene.  This is a coarse grained effort from its outset, as the production fails (if indeed an effort is even made) to combine its elements into a reasonable adventure tale, it instead being noteworthy only for offering little or nothing that might earn a recommendation for viewers.",1152057600,,2248,4.915567282321899
