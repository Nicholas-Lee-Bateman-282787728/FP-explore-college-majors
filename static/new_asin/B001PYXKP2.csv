8334897,2,B001PYXKP2,"The dvd was way overpriced at $84.00 US Dollars.  There was not enough real footage on the true RAI Investigative Techniques by Giovanni Falconi into La Coas Nostra and the True Footage of the Maxi Trials in Palermo  which was Aired on the Australian SBS Documentary in the 1990's.

This DVD is just a waterdowned version of how Giovanni Falconi infiltrated and eventually brought to trial the key figures of La Coas Nostra.

I would not recommend buying this to anybody.  If Amazon could find the RAI Invetigative Documentary of the 1990's I would be more that happy to purchase this DVD as it is so spellbinding and intriguing it keeps you perched on the edge of your seat it is an amazing documentary.  Hope you can locate this.",1433376000,,731,4.627906976744186

Acting, Direction and production are all sound. The writing is a well done reprise of a series of historical facts, well told.",1396137600,,221,4.6923076923076925
