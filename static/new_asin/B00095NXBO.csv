8057415,5,B00095NXBO,"These moves are off the hook awesome, especially the kinda uncanny valley-ish android ones. I can't wait to master them, and have been doing this DVD a lot to really get some of the compellingly weird ones into my muscle memory. I'm not a professional dancer, more of a hobbyist who has learned most of my moves from DVDs and the internet, so this feels like what I imagine taking a class must feel like. I get the impression with this type of dance that the learning curb is steep but that the hard work pays off. A nice bonus: the warm up is a nice mini-workout, as are the muscle contraction drills throughout the DVD, so it's a bit like doing strength training too.",1524528000,,669,4.36
8057416,5,B00095NXBO,"So far, this is great as an instructional video.  Definitely helps to have a few videos, not just one to guide you though if you're a beginner.  If not, you're good to go with this. Very fun!",1513468800,,191,4.135135135135135
8057417,4,B00095NXBO,"Fun. Low impact. Admittedly, the 'android' portion is a little silly. But, hey I'm all by myself in my room, who is looking?",1506384000,,124,4.434782608695652

8057419,3,B00095NXBO,It has some interesting movements and concepts - but is not really one that I would use for practice or classes.,1407715200,,112,4.380952380952381
8057420,3,B00095NXBO,"WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ The Extras - Meaning the ""Dance along sections"" which are excellent to increase your body awareness, rythm and fluidity.
+ Warm up - This is one of the best warm-ups I have seen, it is thorough and tough.
+ Arm & hand positions and movement - I really like her arm & hand positions in the goddess style, although only as ""inspiration"", because specifically for this particular topic she gives little instrucion on how to do it, she assumes you already know it.
+ The fluidity of her tribal fusion style

Maybe it is strange that the best of this DVD is not its core but its extras (the extra dance along sections and the warm-up). So what this practically means is that you should buy this DVD if you are precisely looking for some extras to add to your collection, not as one of your main instruction or workout DVDs. Even the main part that contains the concepts and drills is like an extra to your repertoire of either hip hop or bellydance, since it assumes you already know the basics but gives detailed instruction into a different style. It was difficult to decide whether 3 or 4 stars was more appropriate. I definitely liked the DVD, but I only recommend it, if you are already a fairly good dancer and want to practise something different.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Moderate  TONING: Moderate  CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Intermediate to advanced  INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good  MUSIC: Industrial, goes well with the routines  FUN FACTOR: Medium - the concepts and drilling sections are a bit slow and boring, but the extra segments are fun

CONTENT:
1) Warm up - I definitely love the warm up although it's a little bit long. I use it before other DVD's like Neon's that have no warm-up; it definitely loosens every joint used in bellydance in a simple and effective way.
2) Android concepts and drilling - Good instructional quality
3) Hitting concepts and drilling - Good instructional quality
4) Android moves and practise - Breakdown of combined android moves that will later be used in the choreography
5) Goddess moves and practise - Breakdown of combined goddess moves that will later be used in the choreography. Here the instruction is not so detailed as in the previous sections, probably assuming you are already an intermediate dancer in tribal or classic bellydance. I specially liked the fluidity and how the moves look in this section (a little bit theatrical but graceful and fluid). Small correction: it is not that instruction is less detailed in this ""Godess moves"" section than in the ""Android moves"" one, it is rather that for the android concept we have two previous sections containing concepts and drills that we lack for the goddess concept.
6) Choreography breakdown and practise - Combines the android and goddess moves learned earlier, but the choreography itself is not really one of my favorites, some moves looks a bit awkward.
7) Performance by Fayzah - This performance also combines both android and goddess concepts. Here you can better appreciate Fayzah's fluid style as well as her beautiful arms and chest waves.
8) Dance along sections (body awareness and grooving sections) - 4 different exercise sections to increase your body awareness and fluidity (one is initiating movement using different parts of your body, another is painting on a fictitious wall or canvas with different parts of your body, yet another is imagining you are transferring energy from one part of your body to another and the last one is like a movement & gestures vocabulary section). These 4 parts are excellent and a good addition to your collection. The ""grooving"" sections are several sections which introduce some layering (head isolations, shoulder & hip slides, etc.) into a basic grooving step.

MUSIC: Pleasing Industrial beats; it goes well with the various sections.

EMPHASIS:
Robotic dance; detailed instruction in android concepts mixed with fluid moves from the bellydance genre to create a fusion style and widen your dance repertoire.",1377734400,4,4008,4.933234421364985
8057421,5,B00095NXBO,"This was a pretty awesome DVD. Fayzah is very talented and I love the solo she does at the end. This is not your typical Belly dance DVD because she combines elements of hip hop. I did not purchase this DVD to practice purely belly dance, I wanted something different to spice up my routines. I got exactly what I wanted and more because I can even use some of these moves outside of a belly dance setting such as a club.",1318464000,7,421,4.146341463414634
8057422,5,B00095NXBO,"Android Goddess is a fun and great learning tool for the not so typical dancer that desires to go beyond basics and is trying to develop skills in fusion dances which focus on the concepts that hip hop and tribal fusion belly dance share. This program reminds me of the times I go into my closet and actually enjoy the fact that there is so much to choose from. After all, who wants to wear the same stuff each day!
The typical hip hop concepts that are shared are waving, popping and robotic movements. I find that continuous practice helps ease the transitions in order to form the contrast in fluidity and staccato movement.
The program outline has been well described in the other reviews so I won't go into detail on each section.
 I will focus on the program and not the props, or costumes:-Fayzah's teaching style is to the point. The strengthening and conditioning section integrates yoga poses, leg stretches, and was perfectly adequate for me. The main focus is to learn and develop muscle control, learn specific muscle contractions and isolation along with separation of upper and lower body and lateral movement. I feel that the conditioning section is essential in preparing for these movements and is very thorough. If you are new to this style and the program seems fast paced , each section can be repeated!
The dance along section is fun to explore. Here, the dancer taps into her own creativity using the hands, shoulders, elbows, hips, feet, and adding level changes, turns, etc. to paint on an imaginary blank canvas.  The ""find your groove"" section is not only fun but helps find your rhythm and layers isolations and different foot patterns. A section on gestures, or embellishments, is also a learning tool for the awkward,""what do I do with my arms and hands"" situation.
I gave this program a 5 because it fulfills everything in the program sequence, the end result is fabulous, it also includes wonderful bonuses in the body awareness section to add even more drama and style to your particular fusion.",1300406400,6,2028,4.7749287749287745
8057423,4,B00095NXBO,"I found the warm-up a little too rushed, but younger dancers won't have a problem with it.  This has a good intro to hip hop.  You need to have a little bit of belly dance under your belt to go through this smoothly, so having the basics down will help you out a lot.  I have to mention that I am very glad that not all belly dance videos are geared toward beginners.  We need lots more geared toward intermediate and advanced.  If you like fusion, perhaps this is your next step up from being a beginner.  Happy dancing!",1299888000,4,521,4.212121212121212
8057424,3,B00095NXBO,"Welcome, In the welcome section Fayzah is giving you an overview of what the dvd is about. She talks about the two different concepts she has Android and goddess.
Warm-up and strengthening, I feel as it some of the movements could have been slower, some of them just moved way to fast. I liked this warm-up it was not a yoga warm-up or yoga inspired warm-up like you see on most dvd's. Some yoga was used but not an extremely long section dedicated to it. Like you would see in serpentine or other fusion dvd's. The movements are movements you would likely see in a regular class setting. I do not think this warm-up was beginner friendly. posture on how to do these movements are not carefully explained. Lunges and squats are used and careful explanation on the lunges should have been given but were not. On another note if you workout regularly or dance regularly these movements will not be new or difficult.

Combinations Breakdown
Combinations Deomonstration/ Practice

The sections are pretty self explanatory for the Android portion she teaches hip hop dance concepts
and in the goddess bellydance concepts. There are about six combinations, and then she puts all the combinations together into a demonstration like performance. After the combinations she does a movement flow section that focuses on body awareness, which I thought was pretty cool,:) it reminded me of a section on one of the Blanca's dvd's, where she initiated different movements from each body part. Except this is a  little more free form improvisational. She then goes into gestures and imagery which I loved, she used an african dance move in this section that I recognized and some very asiatic,indian and tribal fusion style movements that were also very nice.  She did not break these movements down that she uses, so if you know them you do if not good luck. The last part is about movement energy which was good.

The problem that I have with dvd's like these is that the breakdown  is not thorough enough for me. I was scared the breakdown would be minimmal like anasma's liquid fusion. While some of the movements could have been broken down with more detail, I do believe these movements are attainable for dancers. Overall the breakdown I would rate 3 stars .I do not think the dvd is geared toward beginners in either genre the breakdown suggest it is geared for at least the  beginner -intermediate. I was a little upset about there not being any instruction in the Drills, you just watched her and moved along. That is not a sufficient amount of time to really get these movements down well enough to just be able to follow aong. If you struggle with either concept then you will have to practice the movements outside the dvd to get them down good enough to be able to do the drill section. Overall I think she did a pretty good job. The instruction was a little better than similar videos and there were some cute combinations. This is definately a dvd you will have to go back to, to get the movements down. If you already have a steep background in both genre's I would probably skip this dvd. If you are an beginner-intermediate in either genre and want to add some variety then it will be fun to have. Equal time was spent on both the android and goddess movements.

I love her hand movements they are so graceful. I think she is much better in her hip-hop dance form than in her bellydance form. But she is a good dancer either way.

Dance along-the dance along I must say was fun, it wasn't just a dance along as in a traditional ""follow me"" it had commentary of what movements to do. She uses some the movements that she taught. It was nothing super hard but some of the movements looked and felt awkward. This is probably more for loosening up and moving with the rhythm than drilling. The objective is to 'loosen up and have fun"". I also enjoyed some of the combo's she creates in this segment.

Performance by Fayzah-I don't know what to think about this performance. Overall I didn't enjoy it. It was weird. You can tell she knows what she is doing but it just seemed like a string of movements put together. I liked the short hip hop portion of the performance though. The performance in general shows a lot of the moves she had taught throughout the video and in her combinations section, and maybe thats why it felt so ""Weird"" because she was just trying to show the movements in a sequenced pattern to let the viewer get an idea of what the movements looked like together.

I gave this dvd overall a 3 because this dvd is not a dvd that if you do not have in your ever growing bellydance library :) you will have missed out on much. It is not a ""Must Have"" to ""Me"", but it is interesting. It added a little more variety to my dance  vocabulary and help me get a feel for some of the hip hop movements a little better. If you have the extra cash and just want a dvd that will do those things listed above then go ahead.
