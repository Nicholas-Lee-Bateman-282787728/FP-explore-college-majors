8613241,5,B00F947N2A,"Entertaining show about a self destructive guy who is irresistible to beautiful women.  Also shamelessly makes fun of the California lifestyle, or maybe just documents it, tough to tell sometimes.  Recommended; I got hooked on the show when I used to have Showtime; was able to catch up when it was offered free one weekend using On Demand.  Now I'll have to pick up the seventh season to see how it plays out.",1404000000,2,410,4.589041095890411
