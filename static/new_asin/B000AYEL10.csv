I saw Nirvana in concert in Oct. 93 in Phx,Az were I used to live and when I saw Kurt play and sing it was perfect without a flaw. It hurts me that anyone could ever talk about Kurt like he was just nothing or over rated,Where in the hell were you in 94 you fool, Nirvana changed the whole world and you sit ther and say he had no talent. If it wasn't for Nirvana & Kurt ther would be no Lame bandwagon Pearl Jam.",1129507200,,584,3.875

Just another typical 'I listen to everything that is supposed to be indie and cool' attitude you are projecting. Get out there, expand your musical horizons, then come back and talk some trash after you've REALLY listened, heard, paid attention and experienced.

2397584,2,B000AYEL10,"I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater.  I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be.  I'm sorry, Michael Pitt is the wrong choice to play Kurt Cobain (even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician).  The trouble is, I don't think anyone could really play Kurt.  I suppose there are people in this movie (Kim Gordan of Sonic Youth and the director Gus Van Sant) who actually knew Kurt while he was alive, so they know something I don't obviously.  Regardless of the mis-casting, in my opinion, the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless.  We already know how it's going to end (like with ""Elephant"") but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes.  I admire Van Sant's lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero Kurt, but it just falls short in the end.",1128038400,,958,4.44
2397585,4,B000AYEL10,"This movie is, to say the least, a great movie from the vantage of a 'real' movie critic. Not some idiot who puts his thumb up for movies that don't mean anything, nor do they educate.

Now, just to put my two cents worth in for this Cure, Pearl Jam stalking freak who doesn't seem to have a clue about, well, anything. You bash one of the best (the best would be John Lennon) writers ever for a reason unknown. Maybe he stole your girlfriend, or did he just upset your depressing mind by taking what the Cure 'would' have said, but put it to better music? Don't get me wrong, I love Pearl Jam (met Vedder when he was drumming for his wife's band ""Hovercraft"" on the Mike Watt tour), they portray a different side of what was going on when we were growing up. But, obviously you didn't grow up in the same time I did (10 years behind I'll guess).

Don't blame Kurt. Who really, honestly, knows what happened. He was having some seriously, messed up issues going on within himself that nobody, but him, could explain.

And who ever compared the White Stripes to Nirvana? Whoever did was not a real music aficionado. C'mon, think about it. Not even in the same paragraph.

Yeah its almost exactly like him but even Micheal Pitt himself said ""it was more of a film for him than about him"" - Michael Pitt and thats a good way of putting it. I didn't like that the camera stayed at like a bush for like 2 minutes, and other things. but i still loved this movie, and think about it this could be the closest we'll ever get to a nirvana movie, maybe we'll get an offical movie if courtney dies.",1127174400,8,470,4.01063829787234
2397587,5,B000AYEL10,"A few weeks ago I had an interesting experience.  Trying to escape my family, I decide to spend the afternoon at the theater, catching up on some of the movies I've missed so far this summer.  I began with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the Brad Pitt-Angelia Jolie action/comedy, and followed that up with Gus Van Sant's latest, Last Days.  Smith had shoot-outs, car chases and fight sequences galore while in Last Days, well, nothing much seemed to happen.  Yet one film had me bored to tears (literally!), while the other kept me riveted to my seat.  Want to guess which is which?

If you don't know the answer, I suggest a little experiment.  Rent both films when they're released on DVD (Last Days comes out the 25th of October) and just try sitting through the inane, incoherent Mr. and Mrs. Smith after having just watched what I consider to be the best film of the year so far.  That being said, though, I strongly recommend seeing Last Days on the big screen.  So much of my appreciation of this film comes from it's photography as Blake, a thinly disguised version of Kurt Cobain (played by Michael Pitt), is swallowed up by the vast, empty space all around him.  This is a film about isolation, mood, setting, not story, and that's just what's conveyed in it's telling.

Now as anyone familiar with Van Sant's work is sure to tell you, his interest in linear film-making has been waning in recent years, a welcome respite after his two most 'mainstream' films (Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester) failed to live up to the potential of his previous career best, 1991's My Own Private Idaho.  And with Last Days, he's finally made his masterpiece, a film for which his two prior efforts are likely to be remembered as dry runs and little more.  And as unjust as that may be, you can clearly see a progression from  Gerry, a good film, to Elephant, a very good film, to Last Days, a great one and his career pinnacle, much the way as Kurosawa used Kagemusha as a tune up for Ran.

The story, in case you're unfamiliar with Cobain's life (as I was prior to seeing this movie), follows a young musician who, after having recently escaped a stint in re-hab, spends his last days wondering his palatial estate, cooking macaroni and cheese, avoiding his hanger-on 'friends,' and composing lonely, morose songs that cling to your memory long after the movie has ended.  It's in these scenes that Pitt, a singer himself, proves that he was the ONLY choice for the role.  Often under-appreciated (in The Dreamers and Hedwig & the Angry Inch) or overshadowed (particularly by Ryan Gosling's tour-de-force performance in Murder by Numbers), Pitt's finally allowed to shoulder a feature film and proves himself worthy of comparisons to James Dean and River Phoenix.

If you're skeptical of that statement, just watch the way Pitt is able to convey so much through body posturing alone.  His eyes obscured behind his greasy, golden locks for much of the film (with the exception of one particular scene where he's allowed to stare into the camera for seemingly an eternity), and his dialogue reduced to little more than incoherent mumbling, he still somehow manages to let us into the soul of the character.  He's on screen for almost the entirety of the film and rarely shares a scene with any of his co-stars, but despite all these obstacles is still able to flesh out one of the best performances of this or any other year.

Of course, much hinges on your opinion of Cobain and his music, though you needn't been a Nirvana junkie to appreciate it.  In fact, it wasn't until after seeing this movie that I bought my first CD of his, and in the few weeks since I've managed to consume almost a half dozen books on his life.  It takes a rare movie to provoke such an insatiable curiosity in me, an experience which makes this film (oddly enough) incredibly life-affairing.",1126137600,111,3861,4.6539027982326955

2397600,1,B000AYEL10,"I've seen the two other films in Van Sant's ""Death Trilogy"": Elephant and Gerry. The reason this one is worse than the others is that nothing happens in it. The character that might as well have been called ""Burt Cobain"" just sits around in the woods, in his house, or in a club. He barely says anything and in typical Van Sant fashion, the camera either follows behind him or doesn't move. When the death scene happens, it is so underwhelming that you almost celebrate that the movie is over. Movie fans should avoid it, Nirvana fans should avoid it. It should just be forgotten and buried in bargain bins everywhere.",1433289600,,618,4.576576576576577

2397603,2,B000AYEL10,"I do not like how artificial all exchanges, gestures and statements appear in Gus Van Sant films - all actions feel overtly premeditated, as if rehearsed 100 times. There is nothing about a character's behavior which denotes normal human meaning. Overall his work comes across as too abstract, lacking in heart and genuine spontaneity. There is no fire - everything is 'too cool'. I observed this first in his terrifying-yet-disappointing and depressing ""Elephant"", a biopic inspired by the columbine massacre. None of the students acted like they were people - they acted like people acting like people. Given the huge cast and wide array of characters I'm afraid the blame for this falls squarely on Gus's shoulders. Perhaps he simply shouldn't be choosing his scripts. Good Will Hunting was a fantastic film that did not lack for heart. Why then, in the years proceeding from this, does he choose these sombre, ambient films with little or no humanity in them?
Each character is a sterile puppet, a purely symbolic entity that we cannot see into or interpret thought from. They're like place mat cards, a coffee-coaster, representative version of people. It feels like he's given them a set of rote tasks to perform, and in having to remember them, they have little time to emote. The only sense of emotion in this film is a sense of laconic depressiveness - much like The Virgin Suicides, Elephant, etc. Is this the only trick this one pony can do? Having seen Good Will, I don't think so, but Gus is quite happy retreading the same ground, hoping for recognition, without realizing that a failing approach is a potentially flawed approach. If there were some sense of progress, contrast in mood or form, there would be some sense of this being a film. Instead we get a film trying to be reality. As depressing as that is, as depressing as reality is, it's not a worthwhile approach. Because film never represents reality as well as reality does.

His films certainly Look pretty, but they leave you with no conclusion, no easy resolution, no lesson, and a deep feeling of emptiness. What, then, is their point? To make people feel worse? Sorry Gus, you've lost me. As for the biopic content of this film, I have no deep feelings either way. It's possible it would've had more impact if it'd been actually based on Kurt's life, but without that it's left feeling a little bit fragile.
Occasionally Gus will just focus on some bit of scenery and force the viewer to just Calm Down and just watch something peaceful for a while, which comes across a little bit patronizing. I can watch scenery all the time - I don't need to be instructed. Overall the film comes off as a whim, and an expensive one. It's irritating and intense and stupid. But at least the ending is tastefully and well done.",1418083200,,2794,4.737166324435318

Yes, the film has very little dialogue and no one really knows what Kurt Cobain did at home his last few days of living except a few friends that saw him for a very short time before he died. Michael Pitt who portrays Kurt does an outstanding acting job of a character that is heavily drugged up. Van Sant has said that this film is only loosely based on Kurt's final hours, but the film in my opinion is its own story and the vision Van Sant put onto screen is a good film. The film is not as good as some of Van Sant's other works, but it is still an experience quite like no other.",1386028800,,740,4.145833333333333

2397629,1,B000AYEL10,"""Last Days"" was hailed by the New York Times as ""one of this year's indisputably great films,"" but I'm just not seeing it.

Director Gus Van Sant does possess a considerable amount of skill, and artistic vision and integrity, as evidenced by classics such as ""To Die for,"" among others. He's also been the guiding light behind some real turkeys, like ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues."" In between, there's ""Finding Forrester"" and ""Milk.""

""Last Days"" may be the worst of the lot.

Here's the movie in one sentence: stoned young adults stumble around and mumble in the general direction of each other.

The film's message - ""Don't do heroin, kids!"" - is well articulated. Problem is, there is zero corresponding entertainment value. Zero. It's unwatchable.

For a fun movie with a strong anti-drug message (""Don't do meth, kids!""), check out 2002's ""Spun."" And let us not forget Van Sant's career-defining breakout opus, ""Drugstore Cowboy"" (""Don't knock over pharmacies for prescription narcotics!"").

Don't waste your time or money on ""Last Days.""",1339804800,,1043,5.105882352941176
2397630,3,B000AYEL10,"""Last Days"" (2005)  is directed by Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy). This film portrays the fictionalized account of the final days of Curt Cobain's life. Curt Cobain (Blake) is portrayed by Michael Pitt as an introspective musician who is in isolation, constantly evading those around him, and stumbling about from a drug overdose. The film doesn't seem like much at first, and I wondered if the character would have any interest if I didn't know that this was about Curt Cobain's last days alive, but gradually these random, uninteresting events that we are shown are pulled together to reveal a mood and atmosphere that becomes hypnotic. An eight minute long dolly shot pulls back from a window of the house where Curt Cobain is practicing his music as a rising crescendo of haunting music collides with Curt's bashing of the drums. The sonic aspect of this scene is somewhat reminiscent of the cacophony of sound heard in Apocalypse Now when the madness is portrayed in the heart of darkness. This and other images, such as those of the towering green rain forest surrounding the old stone house, and the poetic scene of Curt's last breath, make this film a memorable experience.

The two dvd set comes with a full screen and widescreen version of the movie, and there are a number of special features, including a making of the film, a deleted scene, a music video and the filming of the long dolly shot.",1337817600,,1427,4.77327935222672

2397632,4,B000AYEL10,"If you're anything like me, you've probably read or seen a lot of the mixed reviews on this film and as a result are wondering if it's worth watching. I certainly approached this film with much trepidation after reading some visceral beatings it got from people who absolutely HATED it. And the other problem was that the people who praise it tend to praise it in a way that also makes it sound...well, not so appealing. I've been a fan of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain for admittedly not a very long time, I was still a little kid when Kurt killed himself so I sort of missed the era. Which means I have the (debateable) advantage of being able to look at the band through the eyes of a young adult. I recently watched About A Son, which absolutely crushed me. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it.

That being said, finally watching this movie I can see why it is so divisive. It is pretty much THE definition of a minimalist film. There is very little dialogue, and the vast majority of it is nearly inaudible. This is a film you need to throw the subtitles on to catch everything. Not to say that you're missing Shakespeare; the protagonist Blake is mumbling what you would expect an incoherent mumble to consist of. You get a guy who is mumbling to himself in a context only he understands, so as a viewer you're left to speculate. There are a lot of longs shots in this film that have absolutely no action or almost no action. One particular scene comes to mind where Blake is leaving the house and the camera stops following him to just stare at grass for about 30-40 seconds. For me personally, this made me think about the transience of a person you artistically adore's life, the fact that he just casually slips out of frame. For some viewers though, it's just going to be annoying, boring, and pointless. In order to enjoy this film, you are going to have to be sated as a viewer on small details, like watching Blake in a haze as he makes a bowl of cereal and then puts the milk on the counter and the cereal in the fridge. If you're the type of person who, when presented with a character who is alone and socially isolated 85% of the film, does almost no talking, and what he does say is mostly nonsense, thinks to yourself, ""how odd and sad,"" you will probably enjoy this film. If you think, ""this is boring and meaningless,"" there's a good chance you will hate this to varying degrees. Ultimately you're going to take away what you bring in. If you are sitting down and expecting some dynamism or even really structure in the final days of a heroin addict and the people who hover around him, you are going to hate this film. There's no way around that. But if you're like myself, who missed the whole event when it happened, or you were touched in some way by Kurt's whole tragic story, it does offer you a kind of emotional connection that you don't see as often as you should in film. I spent the whole movie wanting to intervene, to just jump in and prevent history. It does a good job of showing you just how inaccessible he was in his isolation there.

One final thought: Michael Pitt doesn't always resemble Kurt to me in the film physically, but there are a lot of shots were he very eerily looks exactly like him.",1277769600,3,3235,4.36318407960199
2397633,2,B000AYEL10,"One of the reviews on the back on the box said, ""...Gus Van Sant's Masterpiece!"".  What a load of crap that statement is.  When I bought this DVD, I was expecting a fictionilized account of Nirvana Lead Singer, Kurt Cobain's last few days before he committed suicide.  What I got was actor Micheal Pitt stumbling around, mumbling to himself, and falling down a lot.  Most of the time I couldn't hear him at all, and what I could hear didn't make the least bit of sense.  I suffered thru this ""film"" (and I use that term loosely), two times.  Once to see it for the first time ever, then again with the subtitles on, which let me see what Micheal Pitt was really mumbling to himself.  I know that ""Blake"" is supposed to be so messed up on drugs that he doesn't know what he's doing, but it makes for a really bad ""film"".  One other thing, Lucas Haas is in this too, and the Gay scene he has is kinda wierd, it's like it was just tacked on for no other reason than it's something Mr. Van Sant wanted and didn't know where else to put it.
  Overall I give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 stars.  Don't waste your time with it, go out and get one of the Doc-U-Drama's made about Kurt Cobain's Suicide instead.  You'll be glad you did.

Update: After rereading this review, plus many others I have come to this conclusion.  As another reviewer put it, ""...It's not for fanboys of Nirvana, or causal fans of mainstream movies.""  I tend to agree.  Yes, it tells the ""story"" of Cobain's last days alive, but it does it in an ""artsy"" way.  I'm not a fan of ""Art House Movies"", because I don't get subtlety.  If I would have known that before, I most likely wouldn't have watched this film.  Make of that what you will.

2397635,4,B000AYEL10,"After just seeing ""Last Days"", I wondered just what it was I saw. After googling ""Kurt Cobain"", it all became clear. Having no experience with ""Grunge"" music (of which there were examples in the film), I didn't know what Cobain's influence was, nor his popularity among the devotees of that particular style of music.
""Last Days"" is the sad final goodbye of this enigmatic young man. It is doubly sad that he used drugs to blunt the depression he felt at how his life was ""progressing"" at that point.
Gus Van Sant's treatment of the film is reminiscent of ""Elephant"". Little dialog, and long shots, maybe too long, to tell a story. After his disastrous attempt at remaking ""Psycho"", it comes as no surprise he would change (permanently?) his cinematic style. Personally, I like the way he's doing things now. ""Last Days"" came across somewhat atmospheric and surreal.
I found the visits by the two men spreading their religion and the advertising salesman very funny. They dove ahead, oblivious to the indifference that was staring them in the face. Conversely, Blake's (Michael Pitt) absolute abhorrence for doing anything to further his career just underscores his drive to do what ultimately killed him. Very sad.

All the performances were very good, and I happen to be a fan of Michael Pitt. This young man has come a long way in a very short time. I look forward to any film he happens to be in, just to see how he stretches himself. That his dialog consisted of nothing more than mumbling, is in itself a feat. Try doing that for an hour or two. I dare you. It's not as easy as one would think, and Pitt had to do it for DAYS.

I fully understand why some will be bored.  Nothing much happens here.  The camera crawls around a lot, seemingly uninterested in its subjects, meandering here and pausing there for no apparent reason.  The ""star"" Blake barely utters a sentence.  Supporting characters come and go without consequence or explanation.  They talk at Blake sometimes, but we come to realize no one can talk ""to"" him.

Blake is utterly lost and alone, and if the film's point is to make us share in that experience, it is successful.  Kim Gordon's character is the only one to make a real attempt at ""saving"" Blake from himself, but by that point we already know that he is beyond redemption.

Several movies have been made about addiction, some good, some bad.  Last Days may be impossible to describe in such terms.  It is, however, highly effective.  It's only fault may be that it's far ""too real"" for the average Hollywood-fed consumer to digest.",1257379200,3,1342,4.63135593220339
2397637,1,B000AYEL10,"This is the story of the last days of Kurt Cobain's life. Though he can't really be called Kurt Cobain, because Courtney might sue. So we have him depicted as Blake- a successful rock star who just wants to be left alone. He urinates in a stream, he eats noodles and he runs away whenever he sees someone at his door. His house is populated with hangers-on and drug-fiends, and just in case you didn't get that- the song Heroin by The Velvet Underground plays. Blake is depressed and cannot be bothered with life- but he has more costume changes than a Mariah Carey concert here. Remember Kurt in the red and black striped sweater? He wears it in the film. Remember him in the black dress? He wears it in the film. The hunting cap? Yep! He wears it here.

This film is so incredibly tedious that it almost becomes offensive. It is as if the director has tried to mirror Kurt's obvious depression and boredom in the film-making. We even get a 30 second shot of a tree at one point- for no apparent reason. Let me get this out of the way- I am a huge Nirvana fan. I am a huge fan of movies. I prefer slow, thoughtful films over Hollywood blockbusters. All I ask from a director is that he move me in some way. Any way! Make me laugh a little. Make me cry. Make me gasp in awe just once at how beautifully framed a shot is. If the rest is substandard I can forgive them, as long as there is something to justify me having sat through their movie. Just do something within 93 minutes that I can take away with me. The main problem is this: There isn't a story here. Kurt Cobain's last few days: He ate, he shot up, he fell over and he shot himself. That is it. Don't offend me by trying to pass this off as something arty and thoughtful. It's easy to say that if someone doesn't like this film then they just didn't get it. It's their fault. They were expecting somthing more conventional like 'Ray' or 'Walk The Line'. No. Chances are that if you're gonna see this film then you're going to expect something different than your average biopic.

I had heard going into that it was tedious, boring and pointless, but I was willing to give it a chance anyway. What you get is an hour and a half of pretensious waffle. There has been some criticisms aimed at this film that there is not enough dialogue. Wrong. There is too much. The man from the Yellow Pages? The hangers-on? Blake reading aloud his suicide note- just in case we didn't get the idea that that's what he was writing? It's all surplus. I could have congratulated a film where the camera lingered solely on the Blake character and showed us no-one else. I could have even accepted his Beavis and Butthead mumblings to himself. What I cannot accept is a film filled with bad dialogue, bad acting and such obvious references to the real life Kurt whilst staunchly denying that it is based on him. My wife turned to me ten minutes into the film. She said ""This is really tedious"". I told her to give it a chance. Not much long afterwards I was willing Blake to hurry up and blow his brains out.

Truly one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to have paid to watch. There is an interesting story about the life of Kurt Cobain that would make a half decent film if made by even the most cack-handed of directors. This isn't it. Why didn't Oliver Stone just make The Doors about the last days of Jim Morrison's life? Because it would have been boring. Instead he showed us the more interesting moments that peppered his short stay on this Earth. Personally, I think it would be a mistake to make a biopic about Kurt Cobain, but if it happens I can guarantee that it will make an infinitely more interesting film than this one.

*Follow-up: Some months later:

I am pleased to say that I managed to offload my copy of this and receive a whopping 2 for it. If you are still in any doubt about how bad this film is I urge you to check out the hilarious music video included on the dvd. Michael Pitt and his awful band parody Nirvana and spit pizza at the camera, whilst they mockingly ""play happy"" for the camera. Truly abysmal stuff. And after sitting through 5 minutes of the Michael Pitt interview I am now convinced that he was in fact playing himself in the movie- what an absolutely boring, aloof and idiotic man.",1254096000,3,4282,4.32089552238806
2397648,1,B000AYEL10,"boring. just plain boring. I highly doubt that Kurt was this boring in real life. There's no dialogue for like the first 30min of the movies. Michael Pitt seemed like he was trying wayyy too hard to capture the ""spirit"" of Kurt. The pace of the movie is just way too slow to keep an active mind's attention. I fell asleep on it for the fourth time now. The movie feels like its trying too hard to convey the sadness and depression, Kurt may have felt in real life. I really think Kurt would laugh at this movie. There is significant proof that he did not commit suicide, for example, when his body was found, the shotgun was on his chest with the ejection port to the right of his body, the spent shell casing was on the left of his body, how is that possible? Also the pen that he wrote the supposed suicide note with has none of his fingerprints on it. Kurt was leaving Nirvana, if you dig deep enough, (im still finding new, info, music, the story really is very very deep and complex) you will find that out. In ""Been A Son"" (which is a much better movie, with Kurt acutally in it) he said he quit Nirvana at least 4 times in the months leading to his death. Michael Stipe said that most of Kurts music would have been quieter with lots of stringed instruments had he lived. From studying his music he seems very suicidal, especially ""In Utero"" but I think he was trying to scare his fanbase off. I used to think he commited suicide but after a lot of different info it seem he was either a victim of his wife, or the music industry (no further police investigations sounds like somebody paid somebody)or possibly both. They should have college courses on Kurt Cobain instead of Tupac Shakur at least Kurt was threatening violence on people. Anyway this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, and just buy ""Been A Son"" if you're interested in the Cobain era. It's Kurt in his own words.",1249948800,2,1894,4.338028169014085
2397649,1,B000AYEL10,"This movie is the worst most boring movie of Michael Pitt's that I have seen. The story is totally dull and boring and hardly any serious and sensible dialogue. Only strange shots of Pitt alone talking to himself and interacting for only a about a minute with one of two of the characters. There was hardly any suspense or spice to this movie. Just downright boring. Do not waste your money or time on this flick. Ain't worth it. Pitt has done much better roles, his best work, FUNNY GAMES.",1242864000,2,490,4.455555555555556
2397650,1,B000AYEL10,"This movie seems like an exploitation on an idea of what Kurt Cobain's last days may have been like. In the end, it is boring, long, slow, and completely ridiculous.",1242432000,2,165,4.533333333333333
2397651,4,B000AYEL10,"Much has been made of this film's minimalist and experimentalist style. At first glance, this is a horrible film.  Really.  The film's main character, Blake, a thinly-veiled interpretation of Kurt Cobain in his last days, doesn't do much of anything for the entire 96 minute running time.  He mumbles imcomprehensibly at least 90% of the time, and the supporting cast might as well not say anything at all, because the viewer hasn't a clue what they're talking about.  The film is drab, boring, and painful to sit through.

But so is addiction.  So is living a life completely devoid of joy and connection with other human beings.  So is feeling completely isolated from any human contact.  So is dying from the inside out.  In portraying these states, this film has a lot to say.

If you've already seen the film and are wondering why you don't understand Blake, don't worry.  You're not meant to.  The brilliance of this film is that it refuses to explain or justify a life of addiction, but rather shows you what it's really like.  It's misery.  It's isolation.  It's entrapment, both in the mental and physical sense.  And, in every way, it's mind-numbing.

Whether you've seen this film or are planning to, it's important that you know what you're getting yourself into.  If you're looking for entertainment or any sort of Kurt Cobain biopic, you're wasting your time.  However, if you want to gain some insight into the life and death of an addict, sans all Hollywood distortions or glorifications, you've found the perfect film.  This film is honest, and honesty is not often entertaining.  But it's real, and that's something one can almost never say about films dealing with addiction.",1238976000,6,1694,4.853146853146853

2397654,1,B000AYEL10,"Kurt Cobain was that all-too-familiar spectacle of rock'n'roll -- a young genius who is ruined by his own success and inner demons, and ends up dying too early.

And while Gus Van Sant never openly admits that the protagonist of ""Last Days"" is Cobain, it's pretty obvious to anyone with five active brain cells that this is a story about his last days. Unfortunately it's hardly a fitting eulogy to such a vibrant personality -- instead it's a slow grind of excruciatingly dull, unspeakably mundane events. By the time the gun comes into play, the viewers will already be dead of boredom.

We first see Blake (Michael Pitt) staggering through the countryside near his New York mansion, muttering to himself and apparently not paying any attention to his surroundings. Upon returning home he makes cereal, staggers around in a dress, and starts zoning out when the Yellow Pages man comes to call on business. He also passes out in an empty room in front of the TV.

If I wanted to see this, I'd go hang out at a frat house on Sunday morning.

The vast, chilly mansion is filled with various drugged-out hangers-on who have sex, go on joyrides and sponge off Blake, although he seems too far gone to really care. And though Blake makes a few clumsy attempts at reaching out, the others see him just as a source of money and shelter. And by the time his mother arrives to try to reason with him, it's clear that Blake has reached the point of no return.... and only tragedy will follow.

Rather than making a straightforward biopic of a thinly-veiled Cobain, Gus Van Sant evidently decided to focus on the last few days before Cobain took his own life in a Seattle greenhouse. This could have been a shocking, haunting experience -- a look into the final hours of a man of wild genius as he started circling the drain. It could have been a look into a modern American tragedy.

Instead we get a film that Van Sant clearly directed while fast asleep. Which is more or less what I wanted to do as I watched ""Blake"" going about the most mundane tasks imaginable.

Admittedly the settings are lovely -- fresh green woods and lawns, and a rambling stone mansion filled with shabby furniture. But nothing really HAPPENS in this movie, except a long treacly string of excruciatingly slow events that have nothing to do with one another. Van Sant spins it out in hyper-realistic style, with no music, mumbled dialogue and lots of boring activities observed in detail -- and frankly nothing could be more dull.

And though a few scenes have a feeling of imminent doom -- such as Blake's fruitless trip to a local punk club, or his pitiful attempts at playing music -- most of ""Last Days"" lacks even the slightest shred of foreboding or foreshadowing. Blake just does a lot of random, empty activities around his house, such as a seemingly ten-minute scene about making macaroni and cheese. No foreboding. And when he reaches the inevitable end, that's it.

Michael Pitt is one of the few good things about this movie. Though Van Sant blatantly wastes his screen presence for most of the movie, his beautiful face and powerful eyes fill the screen during the more emotional scenes, such as Blake's final meeting with his mother. Though the camera rarely captures it -- Van Sant seems more interested in watching him stumble around -- he gives a startlingly, disturbingly good performance when given half a chance.

Most of the other actors, though, are no more than hostile cardboard cutouts, and there's nobody here who has much presence -- which may be appropriate, since they're all leeches. The biggest waste is Asia Argento, who is reduced to a frumpy, grimy nonentity with bad hair and not much clothing. It's anyone's guess why she accepted this role at all, because she's virtually unrecognizable and utterly bland.

""Last Days"" is a movie so soulless, so dull, so utterly staggeringly ghastly that it's actually painful to watch. Michael Pitt is the sole redeeming aspect of this movie, and even he can't save it.",1219968000,3,4009,4.721030042918455

2397668,2,B000AYEL10,"As others have commented, the dreary humdrum of ""Last Days"" feels more authentic (and sad) than a typical Hollywood rendering of the same.  I suppose there is art in the sheer guts to make a portrayal so bleak, so real.  But having said that, to want to invest 90 minutes of one's time in such a story, one has to actually care about the protagonists.  In this case, there isn't any set-up, no reason to care.  In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them).  When the end came, I just didn't care anymore.  If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy.  It was a blessing.

Postscript:  it would be nice to see van Sant make a movie that identifies with real human beings rather than the drugged characatures of Last Days or My Own Private Idaho.  Those folks . . . just let them die.  We don't need them here.",1209600000,,883,4.388888888888889
2397669,5,B000AYEL10,"Being a big fan of kurt cobain, and the legacy of Nirvana itself, i was very skeptical about this film.
to be quite honest, i've never heard of it before, i just saw it by accident on TV on a friday night.
well, let me tell you a few things about it.
first of all, NO ONE could play this role, other than Michael Pitt. in this film, pitt became cobain, he was him, and even SOUNDED like him...its amazing! the things is, cobain's face were much more raw and rough, while pitt is infact a pretty boy, full lips, soft eyes... so, here comes the brilliancy of this film, his face are actually hardly shown to us throughout the entire film. we see his posture, hear his silent low voice, his bent shoulders, the way he does his hair, wear his clothes (too many layers), the way he walks... and we BELIEVE its authentity. we see and feel Kurt Cobain in this BLAKE guy, the one in the movie.

second thing is, the photography is BRILLAINT, and beautiful. blake is being swallowed by all that nature surrounding him, the big space of the house, looks so cold and dirty, while the camera often lingers on his lonely moments of a pause in time, a reccess from life, in fact.

however, while the story line is based on true events, the characters that blake's surrounded by, are fiction, so as some of the events in the film. its probably not so far from reality though, and we realise those people are there only to fill in the void. the story thats being told here, is kurt's last days at his house, after escaping reharb, away from his daughter and his wife, away from his band mates and celeb life, away from all of it. he is shuttered, he is alone but not lonely, because he NEEDS no one in this days, but being alone. he is away with his mind, dissconnected, unattached.
thats the true story here, and everything around it really doesnt matter.

This are the last days of kurt cobain. its not an action feature. people who cannot appriciate art, will not like this film.
nothing much happens here. blake walks around the house, blacks out, wearing dresses (courtney's?...), mumbling things when is talked to, or avoiding any conversation at all, hiding... untill his death.",1208476800,,2169,4.458438287153652
2397670,1,B000AYEL10,"I usually find watching movies a worthwhile activity. I often come across reviews where people complain that a movie was so bad they wasted 2 hours of their life they will never get back. I rarely feel that way. Watching ""Last Days"", I did.

The movie is very tedious to watch. There's no plot to speak of. It consists of endless scenes of lead character, Blake, walking round mumbling to himself, and occasional scenes of pointless dialogue. Some reviewers have defended the lack of plot by saying the movie is a character study. But ""Last Days"" fails as a character study because it never lets us to get to know Blake. And a character study, too, needs something to keep the viewer interested.

""Last Days"" was truly a waste of 93 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I have no idea how Gus Van Sant, who made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Own-Private-Idaho/dp/B00005JLHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Own Private Idaho</a>"", could make such a bad movie. Perhaps the movie is meant to be boring. Perhaps it's the point of the movie. Maybe Van Sant wants to make the audience as bored and frustrated as Blake is.

2397677,2,B000AYEL10,"Gus Van Sant is a difficult and unpredictable director. He can pull off a quirky dramatic masterpiece like ""My Own Private Idaho"", or a hilarious, deranged satire like ""Die To For"" with equal aplomb. With ""Elephant"", he created an ingeniously naturalistic style that made the Columbine-like climax to the film even more powerful. Sadly, that same naturalistic style does not work nearly as well in ""Last Days"". By depicting a series of tedious, excruciating moments leading up to the suicide of rock star ""Blake"" (Kurt Cobain), the film does do a good job of showing the mental state of someone who has clearly given up on life and detached themselves from their surroundings. However, it's not particularly engrossing for the viewer to watch. Michael Pitt inhabits the character beautifully, with his sad eyes, mumbling speech, and defiant laziness. It's just that he never really gets the chance to do much that's interesting, other than wear a woman's nightgown or a pair of spacey sunglasses.

In the end, they feel like the film disappointed them, and that their hero's image was distorted and somehow ""ruined"" by this film.

The film itself is actually a rather excellent and unique character study about a rock star junkie named Blake, who's going through the motions, experiencing the SAME mental and social isolation feelings that Cobain MAY HAVE experienced during his final days. Yes, Gus was obviously influenced to make this film by the whole Kurt Cobain phenomenon. Yes, Gus, you, and I know that it's obviously based on Kurt Cobain, and while the Blake character may resemble him in several aspects, in the end, he IS not Kurt at all.

We can barely comprehend what the protagonist is saying throughout the whole film, and the film itself is rather silent, with minimal dialogue and action to hold most viewers' attention. I take it that Blake's mumbling depicts just how seperated he is from reality in the film, as he can barely make out his own thoughts and words in the film. He's just drifting around his house and friends, not knowing where to go, what to do, or how to help himself dig a hole to the surface, to escape from his own hell.

I love how Blake's perspective is shown in third person viewing. The cinematography allows us to truly experience his isolation, from his perspective, while we're able to watch him experience it first hand. So, essentially, we are experiencing his ""Last Days"" from two point of views. The cinematography in the ""Death"" trilogy is truly amazing.

The most haunting aspect of the film was Blake's friends.

They kept him around, just so they could pry money and shelter off of him. They were merely acquaintances to him now, and in some scenes, they show how much they can care less about Blake's situation. For example *SPOILERS*, the scene where Blake falls while watching the Boys II Men video. Asia finds him, but doesn't even notify the others of his condition. She just props him up against the wall, and leaves him where he is, and goes about her day.

The way the characters are just capable of extracting anything they please out of the lead character while he's going through withdrawal from reality and himself is disturbing to me.

I should point out, and know for sure, that not everyone will find this film watchable, or even tolerable. The film definitely will not cater entertainment to a mainstream audience.

2397685,5,B000AYEL10,"The Amazon reviews for this DVD actually do a good job overall, because most casual fans of popular movies will only be wasting their time trying to get anything of value from this movie.  There is considerable value to be found in the work, but it's obvious from the reviews that only a limited number of people have the patience or the temperament to understand the moods.  It seems to me that the real question is whether or not the movie should have been made in the first place.  It's a movie about the last days of life before a suicide, so with that subject matter in mind I found it to be painful and confusing and at times totally incoherent, but that also made it strangely fascinating and increasingly compelling.  Most of the people who hate this movie should actually consider themselves to be fortunate that they can't relate to the moods, but serious fans of artistic movies shouldn't be scared away by the bad reviews.  There are lots of people who insist that this is totally lacking in any artistic and creative merit, but I strongly disagree, and I wonder how else the critics would portray the last days of the character.  You couldn't add car chases to liven up the movie.  Lots of quick edits wouldn't amount to anything.  Snappy dialogue would be completely false.  I have no idea how closely this movie follows the real life case, and I don't really care about that.  I think that Gus Van Sant simply used the real events as a starting point, and then made the movie total fiction.  I've been in bands and known many people who have never been able to fit into normal life, and some of their stories end badly, so the characters in this movie resonate with me even though they disturb me.  Every movie should be its own world, and one that's different than the worlds in every other movie.

2397687,1,B000AYEL10,"Gus Van Sant has to be one of the least creative directors alive today. He has somehow come to beleive that excruciatingly long periods of nothing somehow amount to dramatic tension or some sort of abstract artistic significance, when actually all that does is create bland, empty movies. I usually really enjoy movies that are stripped down to the bare essentials (Jim Jarmusch?), but Van Sant simplifies his films in ways that are just clumsy and far from interesting (an extended shot of a bush moving in the wind? Come on, man).

The movie itself, as you probably can tell by now, is ""inspired"" by the last days of Kurt Cobain's life. Kurt Cobain apparantly spent his last days wandering through a forest and placing ads in the yellow pages, if you follow Van Sant's account of what happened. There are also extremely forced references to religion and buisness that are not only painfully obvious, but insulting to the viewer, as is the way the eventual suicide is handled. Van also Sant needs to learn some new tricks, because his standard ""half an hour of small talk,"" ""random gay couple,"" and ""show the same scene at two or three different points in the movie"" tricks are not only expected from anyone who has seen any of his other films, but incredibly lazy on his part.

To be fair, Last Days is ever-so-slightly more watchable than his other movies because there is at least a sense that something, sooner or later, might happen. Unfortunately, nothing ever does. Watching the ""making of"" featurette on the DVD also confirms what I suspected all along, that the whole film was more or less made up as they went along. While all that ""experimentation"" may have been liberating experience for the actors, it's a painfully dull one for the viewers. There's nothing poetic at all about the film, it's a hack job done by an egotistical director, and actors delusional enough to believe it all adds up to something profound, or at least vaguely artistic. In reality, it works great as a sedative, but completely fails as a decent movie. And how this is supposed to honor or pay tribute to Kurt Cobain is a question that is best left unanswered.

2397701,5,B000AYEL10,"After watching the gay romantic comedy LATTER DAYS I became intrigued about the Mormon missionaries and googled up this film, with its similar title it might almost be a sequel to LATTER DAYS.  In LAST DAYS, the Mormon elders played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Steve Sandvoss in the first film are here replaced by a cute pair of twins, played by Adam and Andy Friberg.  They really bring a lot of conviction to the part, and although the residents of the castle don't respond immediately to their sales talk, they never seem unduly upset.  I expect the Mormon pairs who come up to people's doors on their evangelical mission must get a lot of turndowns, but I wonder if it's common for the Church officials to assign two brothers (especially twins) the same Mission?  Maybe this is Van Sant's way of saying something about mirroring, the way he was attracted to re-telling the classic Hitchcock film PSYCHO because of its underplot of two sisters, Marion and Vera Crane, with very different personalities, each vying for the same man (Viggo's character) while having to fend off Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates.  Anyway this mirroring or ""twin"" aspect of Van Sant's films has long been a commonplace in the critical response to his work.  What I liked about LAST DAYS which, I must admit, was a little disappointing if only because the Mormon content was ultimately only a tiny fraction of what seems like an interminable film, is that, even when the Friberg boys say goodbye, their aura remains throughout the remainder of the project.

In one sequence a stoned Michael Pitt, wearing a black slip and looking super hot and girlish, freezes up and then collapses in extremely slow motion.  His muscles must still ache having to descend on bent knees at the pace of a snail, it's a feat even Martha Graham in 1934 might have found difficult, and yet it is a moment of real beauty, reminiscent of the famous sequence in Hitchcock's TOPAZ when Juanita de Cordoba (Karin Dor) is shot by John Vernon in the chest and from the ceiling the camera watches her collapse in her red dress, so that the gown seems to be spreading, like a pool of blood, on the marble floors so that the gown seems to be shedding petals like a flower.  It certainly seems as though Blake is dying in this sequence but no, a minute later you see him up and about, carrying a shotgun around, no longer wearing a slip, and in general acting super paranoid.  I thought he was going to pull a Columbine, but at heart something of the Mormon message must have taken hold on poor Blake.

Many have commented on the significance of his name, ""Blake,"" and its echo of the English romantic artist, poet and visionary of the early 19th century.  Like William Blake, LAST DAYS' Kurt Cobain-like singer-songwriter finds spiritual depth in the slightest interaction of man and nature.  He has a deep, perhaps psychotic understanding of the brevity of time and the insustainability of life.  As William Blake wrote,

O rose, thou art sick!

The invisible worm

That flies in the night,

In the howling storm,

Has found out thy bed

Of crimson joy,

And his dark secret love

Does thy life destroy.

The song that Michael Pitt (Blake) composes, ""From Death to Birth"" reverses this sentiment but uses its same general framework.  We remember that Joseph Smith (b 1805) was born in the middle of a great romantic revival not only in this country but abroad, and that the Book of Mormon, ""given to him"" before he was 25 years old, is in some ways the work of a man younger even than Kurt Cobain himself.

2397703,2,B000AYEL10,"isn't that it wasn't a completely accurate depiction of Kurt Cobain's last days on Earth. I certainly didn't expect it to be, for legal reasons if nothing else. What truly bothered me about Last Days is that it includes so many elements that are straight from Cobain's life that it's hard for the viewer to determine where the facts stop and the fiction begins.

Van Sant had a choice of how to handle this movie, although I'm sure it was a difficult one. In the end, he chose to say that the movie was fictional, but inspired on the life Kurt Cobain. What puzzles me is why he would choose to include so many minute details from Cobain's actual life that would lead some viewers (call them ill-informed if you will, but many genuine Nirvana fans will simply be too young to know about the details that we older fans remember) to believe that this story is an accurate depiction of Kurt's death. From the striped sweaters, to the bulky jacket, to the sunglasses, to the hair, to the posture, to the painful greenhouse ending. . . each of these specific choices on Van Sant's part create a relatively reasonable belief that these things ""actually happened."" A decision needed to be made as to whether this was a biography or a work of fiction. To me, that decision truly wasn't made, to the detriment of the film. And casting Kim Gordon, of all people, to discuss the effect of ""Blake's"" life on his daughter struck me as explotative of an already tragic tale.

I didn't detest this movie, but I can't say that I enjoyed it either. If you're looking for a completely accurate portrayal of Cobain's last days, I don't think this is the movie for you. If you are old enough to remember the details of the of the non-stop Cobain coverage that tragic week in April 1994, you may find something in it to appreciate. But I think this movie can best be enjoyed by someone without a blank slate, for whom the film can stand alone without real-life comparisons.

2397704,5,B000AYEL10,"I didn't expect to like this film given the plethora of bad reviews and held off watching it for a while. During the opening sequence where 'Kurt' (let's not pretend he's meant to be anyone else) staggers inexplicably through the woods I started to have my doubts but wasn't too concerned given I had readied myself for a potential dud. Yet as the film film progressed I became less and less concerned with the reasoning behind the unfolding events and started to simply 'feel' the tone of the film and where GVS was coming from in his interpretation of a modern tragedy.
Essentially the only narrative in this film is that Cobain (given the name Blake in this) had left this earth before he pulled the trigger, it doesn't seek to document the potential real life sequence of events, it is simply a rumination and in my view a beautifully realised one to the point where I considered it a work of art.
If you aren't interested or indifferent to Cobain then I'm not sure how you could enjoy this film because it demands a great degree of understanding and reverance for it's subject in order to appreciate what Van Sant is trying to communicate with it. The sequences are long, mostly without dialogue and with very minimal action involved (though beautifully shot); perhaps that was one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much, it was so different from the normal 'busy' style of most film and television.
I can only speak for myself in saying that had I listened to the naysayers and avoided it altogether I would have deprived myself of a great film experience.",1154649600,8,1559,4.611510791366906
2397705,2,B000AYEL10,"A Homeric nod from the great Gus Van Sant.

Just as he made a movie about Columbine (""Elephant"") that wasn't specifically about Columbine, Van Sant has made a film about Kurt Cobain that isn't specifically about Cobain.  Blake is a suicidal rock star who skips out on his detox program and heads to a house in the woods where his fellow musician buddies have taken up residence.  There he whiles away the time till he finds it in himself to take that inevitable step of crossing over into the great beyond.

Let me just state right up front that I believe Van Sant to be one of the most brilliant and innovative of modern filmmakers, and that at least one of his films (the aforementioned ""Elephant"") is one of the truly great films of the 21st Century so far.  But ""Last Days"" looks as if it were tossed off by the moviemaker and a few of his friends during a boring weekend in the Poconos (the film is actually set in Seattle to better gibe with the Cobain storyline).  Van Sant's style, which seems to be becoming increasingly idiosyncratic with each film he makes, has here become so internalized and off-putting that he winds up completely alienating even the most tolerant and forgiving member of his admittedly small core audience.  The movie basically consists of Blake shuffling around the house muttering and mumbling to himself, sometimes wearing a slip and sometimes toting a large rifle, while various irrelevant people from the outside world - a telephone book adman, a couple of Mormon missionaries - stop by for a visit.  With no plot, characterization or conflict to speak of, the film simply evaporates into the ether, leaving us to wonder just why Van Sant felt compelled to make it, and why we should feel any compunction to watch it.  Empty of ideas but filled with self-importance, ""Last Days"" is, without a doubt, Van Sant's least impressive work to date and an ""art film"" in the worst sense of the term.  Let's hope for better things from him in the future.",1154649600,,1981,4.650429799426934

Kurt's friend Kim Gordon asking Blake if he's told his daughter that he's become a rock cliche. Junkie-hangers-ons listening to Velvet Underground. Mormons!

The lack of a score brings up the loneliness of the last days and even the garden house (which looks just like the space above the garage where Kurt shot himself) highlight the isolation. It's an incredible homage to a drawn-out suicide that 12 years later just seems like a momentary plunge into paralyzing depression. Just think about all the great music we've missed from Kurt and Kurt's missed from the world.

Not a film to rock out to - but if you understood Van Zant's Elephant and understood Kurt's pain, you will get a lot from this walk in the woods.",1154217600,,987,4.8
2397707,1,B000AYEL10,"I've never been so bored by a movie for a long time. It is maddeningly slow, not only on the (non-existent) dialog, but even the Cobain wannabe is slow.  Seriously, I literally played this movie at 2x SPEED and he LITERALLY took close to 20 or 30 seconds to bend his knees and crawl on the floor (can't imagine that in real time)!  And the characters don't even speak up, you'll literally have to turn your TV set all the way up and put closed captioned to know what they're saying.

Is Van Sant's intention to portray heroin addiction as a horrid experience that destroys the soul?  Did he want to portray how stardom got to Cobain and messed with him?  I pretty much doubt any of that, I did not feel the slightest shred of sympathy at any time during the movie.  It doesn't go anywhere, this movie is torture at its worst.  The good reviews are based mostly on its experimental nature, the (I don't know where they found it) character development, and the pain (what pain???? the movie doesn't express anything palpable!) Cobain felt those final days.  Every single person in the movie is boring.

The so-called professional critics seems to have somewhat favored this movie and it just escapes me.  Is being artsy fartsy good?  Is showing prominently on camera *just* a TV set playing around a minute or two of a video from Boyz II Men experimental and therefore good? Does it advance the story in any way?  Is that pure genius?  He does have guts though, it takes a lot of them to film that and call it a movie.

Van Sant, here's an experiment for you: go out to the streets, film real life junkies, heroin addicts and transmit their pain to the audience.  Seek out people with suicidal tendencies and find the root of their suffering.  Thirty minutes of that, even if it doesn't have single syllable of dialog, just the look of sadness in their faces will do a whole lot more than this garbage of a film you created and thrust upon us!

I had to check out what others thought because this movie was such a complete departure from any movie that I have ever seen before.

This movie is the exact opposite of formulaic. I felt confused, and for much of the movie bored... which I believe is where the director purposefully wanted to put the viewer. The movie subtly mixes up the chronological order of the scenes so, like Blake, the viewer loses track of what (and when) things are happening. The feeling of isolation is acute - especially when a house guest comes across Blake and asks him for some help on a song. Blake seems to be ready to establish a tenuous human bridge when one of Blake's band members comes across the two and shoos away the house guest- presumably to protect Blake.

I would recommend this movie to someone prepared to see a movie that abandons many of the timeworn conventions that filmakers deploy to keep one's attention (like dialogue, action, and conventional plot). It was definitely a ""pattern breaker"" for me.",1151280000,,1188,4.762135922330097
2397719,3,B000AYEL10,"Every decade has a transitional period, the time before that pivotal moment that defines the new decade and distinguishes it from the last. American pop music in the early 90's was no exception. It languished in the stale, formulaic offerings of the 80's until one song changed everything.

Nirvana's 1991 single ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" marked the birth of a new era in popular music. Soon after the song's video hit the airwaves, the dominant genres of glam rock and dance pop gave way to the ascendance of ""grunge."" As Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain was dragged along for the ride.

Cobain, a reluctant celebrity in life, was elevated to icon status upon his death. Gus Van Sant's Last Days is a fictionalized account of the days preceding Cobain's apparent suicide in 1994. The most surprising thing about this film is that it took ten years to materialize. Despite the specter of litigation from Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, the near absence of films about Cobain is surprising.

Last Days marks the third and final installment of what director Van Sant refers to as his ""death trilogy,"" consisting of three interpretations of man's isolation. In Gerry, two men are physically isolated when lost in the desert, while Elephant documents a tragedy resulting from the social isolation of two teenagers. Last Days attempts to convey the loneliness and despair of a rock star whose superficial social status masks his growing mental isolation.

Van Sant's minimalist approach strips away most of the elements of a conventional story. Dialogue and a linear plot structure are sacrificed in an attempt to achieve an emotional purity. This technique has worked with varying levels of success in the previous films but ultimately fails in Last Days.

The film follows Blake (Michael Pitt), a rock musician, as he leaves rehab and meanders to his crumbling mansion, a perfect setting for his disintegration. It soon becomes apparent that many people are trying to track Blake down. A series of encounters and phone calls illustrate his disillusionment from his ""friends,"" many of whom seem only interested in convincing Blake to do things for their benefit.

Oblivious to his torment, his roommates ignore the signs that something is terribly wrong. Their indifference is best demonstrated in the scene where Asia (Asia Argento) finds Blake collapsed on the floor clutching a rifle. She simply props him back up and tells no one about what she has seen. In another pivotal scene, Luke (Lukas Haas) sees a mysterious figure in the greenhouse but simply drives away without investigating. This foreshadowing is an illusion to the theory that Cobain was murdered, as the figure is clearly not Blake.

The kindest way to describe the pace of Last Days might be languid but truthfully the word monotonous might be more appropriate. Perhaps this was a deliberate move by Van Sant to communicate the ennui of Blake's real life versus the usual perception that rock stars live more exciting lives than regular people.

Ultimately, the outwardly banal dialogue of Elephant was effective in gradually exposing many of the petty injustices and cruelties of high school. Elephant's use of that commonality of experience with the viewer helped to make its characters real and sympathetic. In contrast, the incomprehensible mumblings of Blake in Last Days are less than illuminating. Where we should feel sympathy for Blake we gradually become disinterested and impatient for something to happen.

The sole redeeming quality of Last Days is its masterful use of experimental cinematography. The lenghy abstracted shots convey a sense of easedropping on the participants. The gloomy interior scenes produces a palpable sense of depression and doom. Unfortunatley, while great technique will usually enhance a movie, it isn't enough to make up for Last Days other flaws.",1150243200,3,3853,5.152

Whether the character is called Kurt, Blake or Anne-Marie makes no difference.

All this film says to me is: we couldn't get the rights to the music, or the co-operation of Grohl, Novoselic and Courtney Love.

2397725,2,B000AYEL10,"You may call them a death-in-real-life trilogy from Gus Van Sant. After `Elephant' and `Gerry' both based on the events that really happened in the real life, now comes another one: `Last Days,' about one substance-addicted rock artist named Blake. But you know that it is Kurt Cobain, and the film's end credit, while disclaiming its direct connection with Cobain, distinctly names his name. Nice touch, isn't it?

In this film, Blake (Michael Pitt), recently having escaped from the institute he had been in, walks, walks, walks in the woods back to his mansion, where some of Blake's nondescript `friends' seem to lead comfortable life. And he eats, eats, and eats cornflakes or whatever I do not know. Then he meets a salesman from a yellow page company who talks to Blake (in women's dress) as if everything is normal. You see talkative detective played by Ricky Jay (no card tricks, just talk); plus Lukas Hass, Asia Argento, and some other cameos I didn't care.

This is wildly fictional accounts of the death of Cobain, created by the imagination of Gus Van Sant, who opted for more anti-traditional method of narrative. This means the camera lingers on the figure of Blake/Cobain who keeps wandering, mumbling something, and for ordinary filmgoers like me it is excruciating to follow the action of him, even sleep-inducing. If you praise the film for artistic values (and you're entitled to it, I know) you still would have to admit that you are only watching, or perhaps admiring his intentions, or the `truth-of-life' approach of Gus Van Sant, not the life of someone the film is loosely based on.

So here is a question - how can you say `Last Days' is not a phony when the film, clearly capitalizing on the fame of Cobain, is about one `Blake'? How can you say the film is interesting and refreshing when Gus Van Sant has already repeated the same `experimental' film-making formula in `Elephant' and Gerry' with his most detached touch?

And most of all, just because the film is experimental doesn't mean that it is free from clich? - lingering camera, noisy soundtrack, `natural' lighting, shaky camerawork, etc. -- and in fact it looks like Gus Van Sant is counting on the favorable reactions from the understanding reviewers who are kind to defend, claiming the most obvious - this is experimental. Yes, I know it is. Still that doesn't change the fact the film is dull and self-indulgent.",1146096000,3,2408,4.837378640776699

There are no suprises, no meaningful insights. If Gus Van Sant was trying to guess what the last few days of a drug addicted, depressed man may have been like, that being: depressing, dull, meaningless, lonely, then he succeeded.

2397727,5,B000AYEL10,"Having just finished watching Gus Van Sants Kurt Cobain Biopic ""Last Days"", I would have to say that the number of bad user reviews for this film is disheartening if not totally expected. Admittedly, this film seeks its support from a small group of intelligent free thinkers with depth of personality. You don't have to like Nirvana or even know who Kurt Cobain was to appreciate the beauty in falling down. For those of us who have found ourselves walking the line between the loathing of life's misgivings and the appreciation for the beauty taken for granted, this movie will seem like an old friend.

  The story line follows the supposed final days of Kurt Cobains life after recently escaping a rehab clinic. You never see the escape but he wears the patient ID bracelet throughout the film. In his disillusionment, he silently reflects on his life and the world around him. Instead of finding the good in his existence, he seeks for the good that will result from his demise. It is often the rational that a suicidal individual uses in order to justify taking their life from the ones who may love them. There is an especially warm scene where a friend (enter Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth), tries to coerce Blake (K.C.) out of his home and onto the road that leads to life. Blake quietly refuses, and his friend leaves empty handed. There isn't much dialogue in the film but to say that very little is said throughout the movie is an absolute injustice. The final scene involves paramedics lifting Blake's body onto a stretcher, only to drop his lifeless shell. Furthermore lending to the common notion of mishandling in the investigation (if you could call it that), following the discovery of his body. While this movie has its motivations and messages, there is something to be taken from it. Life is as fragile as it is powerful.

2397732,4,B000AYEL10,"I was nine in 1994 when Kurt Cobain died.  Nevermind was the first CD I ever owned and quickly became a fan when I became old enough to really appreciate music.  Ever since, I've gone through my music phases as most people do, but Nirvana is still the first and the last.

Over this past winter, a friend of mine told me that he had seen 'Elephant' and that he really enjoyed it, as much as anyone can enjoy a movie with such frank subject matter; so I gave 'Elephant' a chance.  I watched it at 6:00 AM and was completely speechless.  The style of the movie was so beautiful and so original that the film haunted me for weeks.  So when I learned about Last Days, I could not wait to see it.

I watched Last Days over this past weekend with my roommate, our friend, and his roommate.  Being the only one that had seen 'Elephant', I was the only one that really knew what to expect from Last Days.  However, at least three of us are Nirvana fans, so everyone else gave it a chance.

From the beginning, there were grumblings.  ""The crackling of the fire is too loud"" (I kid you not, this was actually said), ""That scene was the most boring scene I've ever seen.  This movie has no plot.  There is no character development.  What's with the gay scene?"" and some other assorted gripes.  When it was over, here's where we stood:

My Roommate: Liked it.

My Friend and his Roommate: ""Worst movie ever""

Me: Loved it.

I was once again floored by Van Sant's vision.  The beauty of the shots and the melancholy mood kept me more than interested.  The scene that really stood out to me was the shot through the window where Blake plays every instrument, forming a one-man band.  The beauty of the slow track and the feeling of isolation in this scene could not be put into words.

I am not going to discount the gripes of my friends, however whether you like a movie or not, its best not to talk during it; but that's just me.  The movie has no plot, this is true.  It has no dialogue, this is also true.  I would argue, however, that the character development was there, its just not spelled out for you.  With as little as Blake talked, we knew who he was, his relationships with his friends, and how he felt; his actions spoke louder than any monologue could have.

Blake is alone in the world he lives in; he is lost himself in drugs and celebrity and has no idea who he is or who is friends are.  His friends are leeches.  Not really caring about Blake, only that he remains their meal ticket.  All interactions, albeit one-sided interactions, involve talks of money, jet heaters, and help on a song.

The significance of Blake's lack of dialogue is the sense of irrelevance.  A man on the brink of eventual suicide, physically and mentally destroyed by drugs, is probably not going to say anything too profound, especially in the state of depression Blake was in throughout.  So why say anything at all?  We'd like to think that someone as tortured as he was would go out with a noble bang.  In reality, nobility would have no part and would go out in no more that a light whisper.

This is NOT an Unofficial Biopic.  This is an Anti-Biopic.  All the sense of celebrity and greatness is stripped away and we see Blake in his most desperate days of his life: his last.  He is a man who has involuntarily lost himself amid the celebrity and hates his life because of it.  This is the essence of Last Days and Kurt Cobain himself.  Cobain often renounced his celebrity, which was a factor to his career-long depression.  I believe that this film stays true to this sentiment if Cobain approved any biopic, this or something similar would probably be it.

This film will NOT be for everyone; this is an inescapable fact.  It is an experimental narrative.  Some will either be affected by this film or they won't.  You might like this if:

a) You like Elephant

b) You like Nirvana

c) You can get lost in tracking shots and beautiful cinematography.

Then when I spent 8.50 on a film where people walk around and when it finally gets interesting, it ends I was just pissed.  I spent 1:30 of my time on it and got nothing out of it.  You can't even quote a scene because nothing interesting was said.

Now onto Last Days.  I feel so bad for Kurt Cobain because he was a smart man that lead a messed up life mixed with drugs.  I feel even worse that Gus decided to make something based on his life and make him look retarded.  The point is NOTHING HAPPENS!!  I put my faith that something would happen, but it's pointless talk and scenes.  If I wanted to watch people walk around mumbling to themselves I would, but I don't watch movies for that.  I watch them to be entertained.  I was far from that.

This movie is SOOOOO slow.  So painfully slow.  Hardly any dialogue.  Almost no music, no thought, no talent.  Anyone that says this movie is great is just trying to be artsy.

2397736,5,B000AYEL10,"This is filmmaking as poetry, the kind that resonates long LONG after you finish watching/reading/sensing it. Van Sant's take on Kurt Cobain's psyche is steeped in anomie, loneliness, and the deep sadness that infuses your being when you have given up, almost completely, on relating to others for any reason at all. Blake (read: Cobain), played by Michael Pitt, is a rock icon who lives in a huge mansion funded by his astounding success but who has by this time become completely mired in his own lack of interest in practically anything at all except, occasionally, making music.

But even that is an activity he has just about forsaken. The one time we see him composing a piece, it's from a distance and from outside looking in (he's in one of the many many rooms in his mansion doing this), as though he himself is an outsider to his own activity. This is an intelligent film, really well thought out, with a standout performance by Michael Pitt who, when he does say anything at all, is mostly unintelligible, mumbling, hiding behind ridiculous sunglasses, and endlessly roaming about the enormous grounds surrounding his mansion.

This is not at all a linear film but one whose substance gels, slowly, ever so slowly, very very slowly, based on Blake's psyche and, sometimes, those of his ""friends"" and hangers-on and also occasional interlopers (a Yellow Pages salesman, two religious missionary nut types), all of which adds up to a richly conceived character-based piece that gives you, more than anything else, the sense that time has slowed down, more than it ever could in any other way, in any other film until finally at the end, time stops for Blake forever.

Completely unique, completely unlike any other film from 2005, or, for that matter, a whole lot of other years, Last Days deserves to be seen at least once so that you can feel it, and then one more time so that you can sink into it and really feel it.

Unforgettable. What no one else is doing today in film...",1139270400,2,1988,4.736994219653179
2397737,5,B000AYEL10,"When you're trying to decide if you should watch this movie, ask yourself a few questions:

Do you like ""Elephant"" or any of Gus Van Sant's recent films?

Do you enjoy indie films that focus more on imagery and emotion in place of words and action?

Do you enjoy foreign films by directors like Bergman or Wong?

If so, you'd probably enjoy this movie.  But if you're looking for information on Nirvana or theories on why Cobain killed himself, this movie is not for you.  If you're expecting a movie like ""Good Will Hunting,"" this isn't it.  And if you're looking for a more typical, insane story of a rock star on the edge, maybe ""Sid and Nancy"" would be a better bet.

Gus Van Sant has made a very low key film here, and I think it's his masterpiece.  The ideas he's experimented with in earlier films (and especially in ""Gerry"" and ""Elephant"") are all present here and they combine to give a perfect picture of a confused, tired man who's just given up.

As in ""Elephant,"" the director doesn't try to offer any explanations.  You see a Kurt Cobain like figure walking around in the woods or in a big house.  He seems almost tiny compared to these larger things.  You learn that he's a rock star and he's just escaped from rehab.  He doesn't talk much.  There are no emotional pleas for help, unless they come in the songs he plays while he sits alone.  Without any drawn out monologues or tension filled scenes, you just get a feeling of desperation and you can almost understand why the star eventually commits suicide.

2397749,5,B000AYEL10,"Nothing on Gus Van Zant's resume suggested he was going to deliver a film as powerful as Last Days, the most captivating roman a clef since Citizen Kane. Last Days presents Van Zant's sagacious ruminations on the final chapter in the life of pop icon Glenn Hughes, the mustachioed leather enthusiast from The Village People.

""The Village People sparked a turning point in American culture,"" Van Zant explains. ""They taught us to be authentic, to sartorially embrace our inner sense of self. The story I wanted to tell was how one of these mavens reacts when he feels the cold breath of the Grim Reaper on the back of his neck. Did Glenn, for example, say `You know what, I've only got a short time left, maybe I won't bother with the leather today' or did he feel an obligation to maintain the persona at the expense of being uncomfortably hot and prickly? Those are the kind of questions that haunt me.""

The choice to make Hughes the subject of Last Days is intriguing because he was generally thought to be the least charismatic Village Person. ""It's true,"" chirps Van Zant, ""Frankly, I would have preferred to tell the story of David Hodo (the construction worker) or Randy Jones (the cowboy). But the film is about a man's last days, and for better or worse, Glenn is the only band member thus far to have died. And besides, the steady progress of his cancer gives the movie that `ticking clock' that they blather on about in film school.""

Actor Michael Pitt's portrayal of Hughes rings true, capturing both the humor and pathos of the terminal man without being maudlin. In one scene, the band visits him in the hospital and he immediately lays into the Indian, Felipe (Lukas Haas, in a performance that announces his readiness for leading man status). Hughes needles Felipe for continuing the Native American act even though, ""You're just another dude outta Brooklyn."" Felipe argues that he is part Lakota Sioux, a ""Shadow Walker,"" the Native American term for a man who walks in two worlds. ""Have it your way, Chief,"" counters Hughes, as he grabs at his trademark leather pants with ribald gusto, ""You want to shadow walk over here and smoke a peace pipe?""

Hopefully, Last Days represents a turning point in Van Zant's career, proof that he finally understands the needs of the audience. He's always known how to combine quirky characters with a rich tapestry of images. Until now, however, his films have been glaringly bereft of gay men singing and dancing with exuberant joy.

Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters.

2397753,2,B000AYEL10,"When I sat down to watch 'Last Days"", I went into it with the fresh perspective of a viewer not already immersed in the talk about it.  Being that I was a fan of a few other Gus Van Sant films, it would seem that enjoyment even with the process for which the film was made would warrent some cache.  Dead wrong.  'Last Days' is 96 minutes in which neither the reasons for the main character's senseless death come to light nor does the film raise the most important question of all bio- or semibiographical films.  This question being what made this person facinating to begin with?

  The long tracking shots that made Van Sant's last film 'Elephant' so powerful instead grate on the subject matter here.  It effecively shows the interminable feeling that Blake felt with each passing day.  Even when questioned by another person about how is day is going, his reply is '...just another day'.

  Michael Pitt (Murder by Numbers, The Dreamers) gives a very nuanced performance as Blake, a Cobain-esque rock musician beyond the brink.  He stumbles through this role and mumbles to himself thoughout the whole film, not once actually speaking his thoughts to his friends.  Instead, he spends his time avoiding them altogether.

  As nuanced as this performance is, there is just the smallest feeling that this is just a characture of the real Kurt Cobain.  With the use of many of the imagery that we know of Kurt (the striped sweater, the cardigan, the ladies slip), it is clear that Van Sant is only playing with the surface.

  As the day unfolds, we begin to meet some of the 'friends' and hangers-on that live with Blake and come into his life.  Again, like Blake himself, these characters aren't flesh out enough to understand why they liked him or even cared to be in his company.  In fact, they come off as shallow as the surface with which Van Sant paints his story on.

There are brief moments in which we get a sense in how much these people care for Blake.  The night before Blake is found dead, Luke (played by Lukas Haas) stares at him as if he feels concerned.  In that moment (along with with the cameo by Sonic Youth's Kin Gordon) do we ever get the feeling that Blake is even thought of.

  Three other scenes work, in ways, to make this movie seem undeniably purposeless.  The party sequence, which the friends dance and sing to Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground, did not add to the overall message of the film.  It, however, catered to the hipster chic of the characters themselves.  The scene in which Luke and Scott bed down together I found particularly offensive as a gay man.  The scene neither furthered the plot nor gaves us insight into any of the characters.  It was merely a cheap shot of a racy moment, using gay sex to be shocking.  Unlike its use to open potential areas for discussion in 'Elephant', here it seems tacked on.  The scene is which Blake's body is found, Van Sant uses the moment to break for the realism of the film to make a statement of rock worship, with the character's soul in a nude form assends to heaven.

  After watching this film, more doubts and questions are raised by it.  What made Kurt Cobain such an interesting person begin with?  Did it matter that he died or not?  For those unfamiliar with Van Sant, watch 'My Own Private Idaho' or 'Elephant' instead.  For those who are fans of Cobain, steer clear altogether.  This film, if it does anything, seems to a justification for his suicide altogether",1137801600,2,3468,4.560064935064935

2397756,4,B000AYEL10,"I must admit that the largest reason that I had wanted to see this movie was because it was based off of the life of Kurt Cobain.  I rented it and watched it, and the first time I saw it I honestly thought it was the worst movie in my life.  The dialogue was seldom and monotonous, I didn't understand any of the characters and the plot was iffy.

  I began to take another look at it while watching the special features and I realized that this movie really did have its merits.  What I though once was a monotonous voyage into the seas of boredom turned into the swirling downfall into the abyss of insanity.

  The problem with the movie was that it gave me the idea that this movie was about Kurt Cobain, because the way he dressed, the way he mumbled his words, and of course the caption that said, ""Inspired by Kurt Cobain"". So everything I saw I was comparing to Kurt Cobain, I though Cobain didn't do that, or this or whatever.

  What this movie really had going for it was the cinematography, the dialogue, and the occasional music.  The cinematography was good since it would occasionally move off center, and that made you feel like you were there, trying to turn your head from the problem, but to no avail.  The Dialogue was good because it seemed casual, and wasn't a big part of the movie.  It was as if they weren't paying any attention to Blake.

My favorite was the small performances that Blake would do.  They focused more on feedback, which gave it the feel of angst and confusion.

  To sum things up it's a good movie with amazing visuals, dialogue, and ambiance.  However the movie was built around the life of Kurt Cobain.  If they hadn't attached his name to the movie I think I would've enjoyed it more.  Just remember that the main character is not Kurt Cobain, and aside from looking like him has nothing in common with him.  If you look at it through that perspective I think you will enjoy this movie more.",1137110400,,1938,4.379213483146067

You are looking for a music video if you are bored by this film, and real life is not a music video.  Do you honestly think that Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore would have EVER agreed to contribute to a film that did not portray the realistic unraveling of a musician hooked on heroin who they KNEW and who RESPECTED them as musical heroes?  You know NOTHING about Cobain if you don't realize the importance of these inclusions--read who Cobain idolized as a young musician.  The problem is too many MTV fanboys and girls watched this movie and they're just not mature enough to understand this work.  The scene of ""Blake"" composing solo is shown through a window, a brilliant decision by Van Sant to show the removal of the artist from public view and the drowning of a soul that is occurring onscreen.  Pitt is astounding in this picture, chillingly depicting an artist both trying to escape from everyone and unable to escape from himself.  The confusion in his manner, the blas acceptance and inability of refusal, his desire for contact with friends and at the same time inability to contact, the physicality and slumping and searching, all were masterfully portrayed by Pitt.  My few gripes include the other band members watching the news at the end, afraid of implication, and decision to drive to LA on an open road-way. Way too ""Good Will Hunting"" in view and I didn't think it added anything to the film.  The details-the phone book salesman, the Bible twins, the kitten (a desire for tenderness Blake can control)--all seemed just so surreal and fascinating and real.

2397761,4,B000AYEL10,"I have read a lot of the other reader's reviews, and the reason why they scored this movie so low is not because of Gus Van Sant's film making abilities, or Michael Pitt's performance, or any elements of film that were missing, it is because they went into this film expecting to find about more about how and why and if Kurt Cobain was really crazy, if he was mentally ill and committed suicide, or there was some kind of external force.

There are still many speculations on how and why he died, there are many books about it, I recommend reading those over seeing this film if those are the reasons for seeing this, but if you are looking for a movie with a great atmosphere, a really powerful movie about isolationism, character development, and overexhaustion of depression, than this film is right for you.

Michael Pitt did an amazing performance as Blake, who represents the much acclaimed lead singer of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, and he isolates himself in the outhouse of his own home, while people are trying to find him and question his random disappearence, just as his band is starting to hit it big.  He is wrapped up in his own problems, and he has not only cut himself from society, but locked himself in his own world, and his own music.  This movie is very slow, and all of the characters are fictional representations of real people, but the directing in the movie was top notch.  The same director of Good Will Hunting, Gus Van Sant, and he gives you this very gloomy and ominous atmosphere throughout the whole movie.  He hints out it the whole time.

There was once scene where the TV was on, and you could see recorded footage of what happened the day Cobain shot himself.  Another scene had some guy tell this 'fictional story' to this other guy, which was really the story of Cobain.  Little touches here any there not only embrace the person watching, but nudges them on to inevitable show you what happened.

If you're into good film, this is a great choice.  Nirvana fans MAY or MAY NOT be disappointed with the film, but unless all you watch are shallow films, this film is phenominal.",1135296000,3,2111,4.54353562005277

Some questions will be asked by those who are not aware that this film is an ""artsy"" act of self-stimulation on the part of Gus Van Sant:

Why are they calling him Blake?

What the heck is that mumbling, homeless drug-addict doing in that castle?

Dear GOD when is this going to be over???

My question: Is anything to be gained from invoking this dead man's image for a film that does not require him, and adds nothing to him - that certainly only subtracts from him?

Gus's next film will be inspired by the last few hours of Hitler's life. Except it will take place in the Gobi desert, on a Ferris wheel, with seven pre-teen boating enthusiasts dressed as Vikings. The Hitler character will be named Clayton, who will dress up like a woman and mumble commercial jingles in the style of Wagnerian operas. Of course there will be an obligatory, guy-on-guy non sequitur.

2397763,3,B000AYEL10,"I truly appreciate Gus Vant Sant's work. I really do. However, I think ""Last Days"" was mediocre compared to some other movies of Sant's such as ""Elephant"" (loosley based around the Columbine shootings.) Last Days posed some interesting insight on to the vastness of lonliness that Blake (or rather Kurt) endured while the rest of the world seemed to rotate during his ""last days"" on earth. The long shot of Blake making music with loop effects shows exactly how musicians like Kurt worked (maybe myself included), where you didn't see Blake play music very much, if not, at all, until the one moment he seems to explode with artistic energy. I can clearly see how Sant wanted to portray this type of emotion, and he did it well. However, the film requires patience where there is no concrete plot and nothing really ever happens. But that doesn't make it bad. It merely presents a period of time rather than a story. This is very characteristic of Sant's work. A person who did not know who Kurt Cobain was may be a little more at loss with this movie. Yet, the final scene of Kurt rising out of his body in silence was so surreal in showing him finally escaping his lonliness. That was an excellent scene. With that said, it provided some interesting ideas, but then again, I watch movies to be stimulated... and ""Last Days"" succeeded only on a moderate level for me. However, its still a movie worth renting (maybe not buying, but it is rather an art piece which gives it some special aethetic value.) If you get turned off by this director because this movie, trying seeing ""Elephant."" If you don't care for that either, then you just may not be a fan of Sant's work.

2397766,4,B000AYEL10,"Gus Van Sant has some balls making us watch Kurt, I mean Blake, sketchily make cereals* and slip down a banking for an hour. Though I'm glad this came out before some utter crap pure cheese Kurt movie eventually surfaces.

It's next to impossible for somebody to take off Kurt without coming across as corny. Which may be the reason Blake likes to mumble. One question I have is how the hell did Michael Pitt remember all his lines????????

How do you remember specific mumbles?

Maybe he attached references to them, like the consistency of cheese could be a reminder for one specific mumble. Maybe the lunchtime mumble. Although the time shifts in this movie may make any points of references redundant.

All in all this movie is not crap. Which is an achievement. Writing the last, unknown, days of a genius is pretty hard. And Michael Pitt does a far better job at writing Kurt like songs (Michael actually wrote the songs in the movie) and playing Kurt than Puddle Of Mudd ever will.

To get all the references in the movie to the real deal it helps to be a very big fan of Kurt. Anybody saying this movie is not about him needs to read a book or three. You don't need to bother yourself with any of Hank Harrisons books though. (Courtneys father, writes books about his daughter and Kurt because it's the only line he can go down to make money)

This movie does fall short of including a lot that is Kurt, but in his last days it's probably comfortable to say that his humour, ultra sharp wit and general character were pretty shot. The first 27 years of his life were a hell of a lot more entertaining than his last few days.

The editing and collage-ness art-ness feel of this movie is great.

2397767,3,B000AYEL10,"I thought this film was good and bad. I think Van Sant should have taken the film in another direction instead of the lost, reclusive, and broken soul of ""blake"" downward spiraling to his death. The character of ""blake"" was outstanding in a portrayal physically of Cobain and the repro's of the greenhouse and the final scene of the SPD at the residence investigating the scene was also well done. And who can't help but notice these details even down to the Tom Moore cigar box. But I don't agree with the portrayal of ""Blakes"" mental state. This obviously is a guess given if you believe what happened at the conclusion of the film really in fact happened. The good thing is we never see Blake kill himself so that is really left open to interpretation. I think the ""gone in the head"" mental state of the character was overdone and i agree with others who say the film was drawn out with some dull moments that took up a lot of film time and really had no point, but overall I would say the effort was good and the film ok...it was watchable, but to Cobain fans and especially those skeptical of the suicide verdict it may be a bit hard to swallow.

2397778,1,B000AYEL10,"From Smother Magazine smother.net:

It's obvious that this movie is supposed to follow Kurt Cobain's last moments on Earth before he commits suicide. What's not obvious is how badly this movie views. While I'm all for creative art films and I've liked many that most find obnoxious or outright boring, I can't stand movies that forget that we're supposed to be entertained. What director Gus Van Sant (""Elephant"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Drugstore Cowboy"") does well is attach the state of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and societal indifference that Kurt must have been going through in his last moments. And certainly that would make this movie special-if it hadn't been dragged out for the entire movie. There's a lack of anything really going on. We watch as he swims in a stream in the opening, then makes a campfire, and then in the morning wanders back to his big house. And just as isolated as he indeed is after his escape from the detoxification center so is the audience. You sit there aimlessly watching a main character be aimless, knowing and anticipating the conclusion, but bored in the wait. Perhaps that's the irony isn't it? Our heroes can just be boring dorks that seem oh so majestic when the media props them up but when we peel back the layers we expose them for the sorry excuse that they truly are. It's just a shame that you have to sit through a movie this intensely boring to figure it out.",1133654400,16,1419,4.721774193548387

2397780,4,B000AYEL10,"I found Last Days to be a far better film than most critics and audiences seem to have found it.  Not only was it watchable, despite being very slow, it was at times very funny and it was certainly a wonderful alternative to the cliche world of Rock and Roll bio-pickes.  Van Sant doesn't for one second try to explain or over-indulge the audience with a sorrowful tale of one man's inability to cope with this fame.  This is refreshing to me.  Van Sant doesn't give us a cookie-cutter mold of what a film about a popular icon is supposed to be, so I was not sure what to expect, which helped me enjoy this film.  Many are put off by the mumbling and incoherent rants of the lead character Blake played by Michael Pitt, but I found them to be funny, especially when he's attempting to communicate with a Yellow Book salesman who has him confused with a business owner.  Its a slice of life-before-death film, and fans of Cobain should be warned about what NOT to expect.  This is not a biopic, nor was it ever intended to be one.  If anything, Van Sant is simply guessing what he belives it must have been like for the last day(s) of a man who has decided to kill himself.  Visually the film was stunning, and Van Sant seems to be an expert at using the silence between people in order to emphasise natural noises, which gave me a nice sense of calm in watching the film, another reason why the movie was easy to watch.  It was never hurried, and its shooting perfectly matched the script's and character's pacing.

I find it very strange that so many people called Gus Van Sant's previous film Elephant a masterpiece and this one is being called a terrible film.  They are shot the exact same way, and the tone and mood of both films are VERY similar.  I thought Elephant's subject matter (a school shooting) wasn't appropriate for this style of film making where the audience is put down in a spot to merely observe events happening.  Last Days, on the other hand, is more fitting.  No matter how tragic Cobain's death was, I find it hard to compare the suicide of a rock star to the murder of several innocent school kids.  If anything, Last Days gives us more to watch, as we actually have a character worth paying some attention to.  True, Blake doesn't do much at all, but when he is spoken to by people, or when he's got a hunting cap on and creeping around his house with a rifle as if he was a hunter stalking prey, its easier  to watch than a bunch of kids walking around for an hour, then have two other kids shoot them for half an our, which, basically, is what happened in Elephant.  The character in Last Days may not be too in-depth, but at least there is a character worth caring about.

A film like this also shows the importance of reading reviews before viewing.  Most people get the film thinking, ""Oh, its about Kurt Cobain.  I like Nirvana, so I'll like this movie"" without bothering to find out what makes this film so significant.  This is not a movie about Kurt Cobain.  This is not a movie about the tragic fall of a rock star.  Really, its not a movie about much of anything, except a guy who walks around in a drug-induced hypnotic state shortly before he kills himself.  Buyer beware.  At any rate, I liked it.",1133049600,17,3239,4.363939899833055
2397781,3,B000AYEL10,"From reading reviews of this movie, I expected it to be just awful . . . but it's not.  It's an interesting case study of one of rock's great personalities and innovators.  Obviously, those expecting to be entertained are not, and those expecting ""insight"" at least will get that.  As hard as it may be for some to accept, Grunge is nothing more than the way it looks and sounds.  Although, Cobain's greatness is debatable, his legacy will outlast debate, as his music and style defined American youth angst for the 80s-90s.  There always has been youthful angst, and there always will be, it's just that Nirvana excelled at defining its generation.

Gus Van Sant seems to have lost a few fans along the way to Last Days, who feel that he is out-of-touch when, in fact, Last Days is done in proper Van Sant form (Indie) and defines Cobain and Grunge perfectly.  Maybe all that inner anger takes its toll more deeply than before imagined, and its effect will be felt in multiple ways reflected in youth defined that way.  I admire Van Sant for making movies he wants to make.  Even his great successes had little regard for what the public may want.  For this alone, true fans should stick with him and, at the least, try to understand his motives.  Van Sant lately has fixated on case studies of troubled young white males, who it seems America has forgotten (in a sense).  For better or worse, being a young white male in America has no special meaning.

Last Days is an emotional piece and we are taken into the nearly vacuous mind of Blake/Kurt, in his final hours, who doesn't have much left to live for.  Too much too soon, maybe?  It seems that his creativity coincided with economic necessity.  After success, where to then?  Moreover, he must have had some very serious emotional conflicts.

Atmosphere is very key in this film.  The photography is well done in the sense that it adequately compensates for lack of dialogue.  Isolation and despondency are made clear by the vistas, fields, verdant greenery, and one man being out there alone.  It is helpful to know that the film begins with Blake/Kurt having escaped from a drug clinic spending the first night in the woods near his country estate.  Van Sant's use of the Boys II Men video, ""On Bended Knee,"" serves to emphasize (possibly) one's realization at the end of  all hope.  The lyrics in this song are of a man who wants to ""go back to the way that things used to be.""  And he is begging and praying for that possibility.  Maybe, Blake/Kurt didn't pray to any god, but through Van Sant's artistic license, the video suggests that he realized he was in trouble and wanted to return from the brink of destruction to a former good place, but had no one to help.  Therefore, he continued composing his suicide note.  Apparently, the Hollywood machine consumed him, feet first.

Avoid this film if you don't have the patience to follow a nearly catatonic case study for 97 minutes, just to realize something that you already know.",1132963200,,2994,4.617424242424242

I think Van Sant and crew must've filmed this as a practical joke. He must've thought, ""Gee, I have one more movie left in my contract. I think I'll just wing it. No script, no dialogue, let's just hang out at a swank college in upstate New York and soak up some indie/underground rock."" Maybe they did it at Bard College. Bard/Blake -- get it?

I will say that the music video is a lot better than the movie. It's a hilarious parody of Nirvana that's funnier than Weird Al Yanchovic -- but then again, Al isn't that funny. That video is more of a tribute to Kurt than this sorrowful excess of cinematic depression.

If Van Sant had intended to punish his audience by ensconsing them within the mind of Kurt so they can experience his psychotic depression, he should've kept that deleted drum scene and expanded the dolly shot zooming in on his ""performance"" in the dark, dank room of the house.

I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this.

2397798,2,B000AYEL10,"Slow paced can't describe this movie. Slow paced usually means it takes awhile to get to the good parts(climax)this has no good parts.

Many may be able to tell i'm a Kurt Cobain fanatic from my reviews. I can't stick up much for him here. As the actor who plays him fails to replicate Kurt and his attitude. The whole plot is summed up on the back of the case wich tells you everything from starting to end and then some. If you didn't know who Kurt was this doesn't help as you may not of guessed who Blake(the main characters swapped name instead of Kurt)was,looks alot like him and thats where it ends.

The idea sounds awsome on pen and paper make a movie of a rockstar thats cool. Ecspecially Kurt Cobain. Though it lacks,even down to the audio. Kurt loved music this fails to show that. This movie hardly has any music at all. The filming seems shaky at times and mumbling Blake makes the movie just that much better.(notice the sarcasm).The other characters really seem off. They don't seem to professional. They ramble on and on to kill time in the movie. Wich just bores you more. The movie doesnt give you the impression Blake was a rock star many people can play a guitar. This movie doesn't show you how he ecscaped from his wacko clinic. The bac kof the box has to tell you.

""It's Better To Burn Out Then To Fade Away""-Kurt Cobain. I think Kurt is now telling us burn this and watch this fade away.

2397799,3,B000AYEL10,"This movie was certainly difficult to watch. It has very little dialogue and action, and almost no plot. However, you must keep a couple things in mind while watching this movie.

First, this movie serves as a biographical account based on the last days of Kurt Cobain's life. It's not pretty, and it's not even exciting. That's not the point. This movie gives its audience the opportunity to witness the end of ""Blake's"" life.

Also, part of the reason this movie seems so sluggish is because several of its characters are subdued by their addictions. This is why Blake mumbles and behaves as he does throughout the film - he's strung out on heroin. ""Last Days"" does not show him shooting up, so I could see how people would miss that.

And in terms of music, the only music video showed on this film is from Boyz II Men. While there is a scene where Blake and his friends play, it is by no means a Nirvana performance.

""Last Days"" isn't all bad. From a strictly cinematographical point of view, it is intriguing. However, if you aren't interested in art films or in Kurt Cobain's life, this movie is probably not for you.",1132358400,2,1124,4.522167487684729

The main character mumbles through the whole movie inaudibly. If you don't know the Kurt Cobain story pretty well, upon which this is loosely based, don't go to this movie for help with the tragic true story-you'll be lost. You don't know who or in what relation to Blake(Cobain) the characters have or of what importance they are. The private investigator for instance is pretty important, as was with the real life investigator in Cobain's story-but you'd be unable to tell that from this film. Why are these freeloaders in Blake's house? Who are they?

Cobain actually left a drug rehab in California and was missing for 7 days before found dead in his garage in Washigton state of an apparent suicide. The only clue you have for this rather important bit of information, is the hospital bracelet around the wrist of the character Blake(Cobain). Van Sant takes terrible advantage of his viewer-I don't mind working a little to understand the story of a film or book but the writer/director has to throw a bone to their viewer/reader. Van Sant doesn't through the whole film-his style is self serving and egotistical, the title alone speaks to that-Gus Van Sant's Last Days?? Puhleese. I though the film was supposed to be based on Kurt Cobain.

You care nothing about any of these characters, know nothing about them. Kurt Cobain deserved a better story, fictionalized or not. His is the classic, sad, tale of the junkie artist so I was hoping for a Sid & Nancy type tragic junkie bio story or even a fictionalized piece that's rough and vulgar like Trainspotting was. Folks there's nothing here-this was a lousy film with a waste of some good actors like Lukas Haas (boy in Witness).

  It seemed to be all surface, a very heavy subject but lacking any depth or understanding of the issues at hand. Other critics I read were impressed with the style and non-dialog driven aspects of the film. I'm all for no dialog because talk in film as in life is cheap, but I'm not into zero content. The characters were cardboard cutouts, cliched stereotypes of the rocker variety. Their acting seemed to be posturing learned by watching bunk like MTV. ""Koyannisquatssi"" or however you spell it has the real deal feel of the power of the purely visual. This film was like looking at a Hallmark nature calendar.

  ""Venus in Furs"" as a big song(?) where has Thurston Moore been(?) sure it's great but it was a music video 101 choice, (yeah the Velvets: boring heroin/S&M vibe, now mainstream) oh so typical...should have used some unsettling and oh so rare, hardly ever heard audience upsetting rock masterpiece like ""Abuse Myself, I Wanna Die"" by G.G.Allin. Yup! A very to the point song.

 It was wrong, very wrong to exploit a great musician like Kurt Cobain in that manner. It's just the kind of thing that must've driven him over the edge. The media carrion exploitation machine. It would be an insult to anyone to be portrayed like that, it was so cartoony, cliched, and nowhere. I think the Syd Barrett portrayed in ""The Wall"" was probably better if memory serves me.

  Van Sant would have been much better off creating his own imaginary rock icon and exploiting that. Then he'd have to put on his thinking cap and actually figure out a script. The time shifts were nice in concept but not indeed.

2397808,3,B000AYEL10,"Once I felt the emptiness of the lead character in Gus Van Sant's ""Last Days."" It was at the end of a 31-hour drive from California to Nebraska on New Year's Day when I nudged my friend and pointed out into the blowing snow.

""Look at that giant dump truck, man. Just look at it. Look at it."" It was five in the morning. When I later stumbled into my dorm room I wanted to cry, but instead I kneeled right there on the floor and leaned on the TV to sleep.

We never learn why Blake the alternative rock star inhabits this state as a daily routine in ""Last Days."" Because actor Michael Pitt looks and dresses like Kurt Cobain, shambling about in his Upstate New York castle, muttering under his breath, we are to borrow the reasons Cobain claimed for his exhaustion and use them here. It'd be easy to say Blake's apathetic, except that he seems intent on hiding from people hired by his record company to find him. He is certain of his own suicide before he commits it. The movie plays out like a

morbid last meal.

Van Sant purposely drains all the psychological pap and drama out of this story. This is the terminus of Blake's life, not the downward spiral. The tears have already been shed, the chances at recovery wasted.  The immensity of Blake's reduction denies him the ability to reach out, or be reached. The groupies hanging out in his castle ignore him. A bandmate (Scott Green) engages the singer only to tell him he wants to go to Utah. Blake's longest chat is with a (real) Yellow Pages salesman. When he speaks it's a whisper. When he sings, it's unintelligible. He swats invisible flies, hears bells in his head.

""Last Days"" takes considerable discipline to appreciate. Unlike Van Sant's previous stunner, ""Elephant,"" there is no drive to the plot, no final movement, no climax. Scenes drag out beyond their purpose. How many times can Blake walk around in long underwear toting a shotgun? Why a scene of Blake preparing macaroni and cheese? Or the Boyz II Men video? Or the Yellow Pages salesman, Thaddeus A Thomas, who walked onto the set one day and was given, arguably, the movie's fourth biggest role?

Van Sant walks the tightrope between commercial and Andy Warhol cinema, and here, possibly because he is too familiar with the subject, he indulges far more than he should, presuming the connection to Cobain will inject meaning where his camera has provided none. Pitt takes his role too literally, and makes Blake a fool without insight or kindness. I don't think we're supposed know what it is about Blake now that matters to music, but Pitt blocks us from knowing what it was.

Kim Gordon makes a brief but memorable cameo as a record exec., and makes a final futile attempt at drawing Blake out of himself only to leave away empty handed.

If Van Sant wasn't a name director, however, people wouldn't give it a second glance and read into it what isn't there.  But that's how it goes... certain artists are given license to bend the rules and sometimes it gives a medium a needed break from the conventional (uh, like Nirvana, irony of ironies).

2397816,3,B000AYEL10,"There's a slow prodding movement to the tragedy portrayed in this film. I appreciate that Gus Van Sant took the time and used his imagination to produce a possible view of Cobain's end. That said, I think the character ""Blake"" falls short of capturing the tortured life of Cobain.

Van Sant's distant shots of Pitt are worth while as, like in an intentionally slightly out of focus work of photography, the image allows the viewer to reflect and imbue it with subtle indirect connections. This quality does well to set up an expectation of Blake as a self-sacrificing Jesus, with the potential to lead his flock out of (or maybe just to confront) the meaningless of a meaningless world. The problem is that, Van Sant does not deliver. Blake's mumbling (not completely unlike Cobain, but more reminiscent of REM's Michael Stipe) can't be accepted as a substitute for actual dialogue. One realizes that Van Sant wants to maintain the illusion of a Cobain-like presence, but what we end up with is little more than a ghost of a person. The music, while atmospheric and intriguing, produces the same absence. Thank God, by the way, the video included on the DVD was not included in the film itself -- it disrupts any Cobain/Nirvana vibe Van Sant might have achieved, and is downright embarrassing.

On a positive note, I do like seeing Cobain portrayed by the use of simple detailed activities. I think watching him fumble about is more successful in representing a person capable of somehow finding the unique in the mundane, rather than painting him as a genius breaking down. Van Sant suggests but never actually shows us the character's excesses. I'm not sure this works to the advantage of developing the character, but it does reinforce the image of Blake/Cobain as being someone special. Blake's relationship is with his art, not his celebrity. A more typical film about a more typical rock star would have nothing else to do but concentrate on the excesses.",1130889600,2,1961,4.850746268656716

2397818,4,B000AYEL10,"there are enough reviews here about the plot, but here i will look at the film.

beyond the unfortunate scene at the beginning with kurt/blake howling ""home on the range"" to a campfire, this beautiful film is a meditation on stillness.  maybe not for everyone, sure, (patience and a willingness to be taken on this trip are essential to viewing this film). but think of the analogy of stillness, hypnosis, to one in a full heroin fix, (as blake seemingly remains most of the film).

the forest scenes are ethereal.  the house scenes haunting.  the viewer is made to feel the apathy of a junkie by giving and getting nothing from the company or surroundings offered.  the most cohesive dialogue, and the films' rare musical scenes, can be the efforts of others, and of blake himself, that actually cut through the din of a sort of doped up white noise that a junkie experiences when high.

i found one of the most pleasing scenes to be the simple, poetic choreography in the fix/boyz II men video scene.  gus pulls no punches, and shows us, in real time, heroin taking it's haunting effect.  in the background, a relatively absurd and melodramatic boyz II men video plays on a tv, (complete with tootie from facts of life in a guest cameo).  blake slowly, slowly collapses as we get a fullscreen shot of this mtv nightmare.  a comment on the fabricated boy bands that would stay long after nirvana deacesed/disbanded?  perhaps.  or maybe just a promovie making manipulator, expertly letting us squirm in our seats...perhaps we all should squirm when dealing with heroin, mtv, etc...

finally, the soundtrack is divine.  without getting into the history of ""musiq concrete"", this film is unique in the use of a soundtrack to actually function as a environmental device as opposed to the usual narrative device, (think of the tension that , mostly non, scary movies use to supplement the tension they can not provide on screen).  it's a beautiful use of john cage theories of ambient noise as music.  maybe a bit avant for the typical movie audience.  just as nirvana was a bit underground for mainstream, (still i remember seeing nirvana live and there were plently of backwards, baseball cap wearing frat boys having no idea what ""in bloom"" means).

in any case, gus will make you FEEL something with this movie.  there is no leave it or take it.  let it take you where it will.",1130889600,4,2377,4.720873786407767
2397819,2,B000AYEL10,"Once again, for the third time in a row after Gerry and Elephant, Gus Van Sant has forced me to be a part of his personal exploration of film. He has an uncanny ability to make ninety minutes seem like days. It seems that his direction is no longer about getting his audience to have a reaction, but instead it's now entirely about his selfish desire for different film techniques and experimentation.

Last Days is a fictional account of what may have happened during Kurt Cobain's final days. What happens in the life of a rock star right before he blows his head off? Apparently, it includes running through the woods, cooking macaroni and cheese, and stumbling around the house incoherently with a shotgun. That's it.

Kurt's character, Blake, played by Michael Pitt, has absolutely no meaningful dialogue with anyone in the movie. The closest he comes is when a yellow pages salesman tries to sell him some ad space in his book. This is a 10 minute scene about ad space in a phone book. What does this have to do with anything? Much like the rest of the activity in the movie, absolutely nothing.

The sub-characters around Blake are so thin they feel like unnecessary backdrops. They offer very little dialogue or purpose in the film other than to add some color and a few humorous scenes. It's never explained who these people are, if they're members of Blake's band or just friends. They're more annoying than anything when the fascination in the movie lies solely on Blake's character. Pitt does a nice job of mumbling this character around and truly capturing Kurt's mannerisms and paranoia. Somewhere in the middle of the random stumbling, mumbling and walking around, there's a scene from the outside of a window where on the inside Blake begins to mix music. He starts a guitar riff, loops it, starts another, loops it and within seconds a song unfolds, an introduction to the first music of the film and good enough to be on any of Nirvana's albums. This was one of the few enjoyable scenes that allowed me to travel back to the days of grunge and think about the genius of this guy that put a hole in his head. Still, even with these tiny moments of brilliance, Blake's movements become repetitive and tired as does the search for anything interesting in this film.

In a way, I admire Van Sant's minimalism in picture and dialogue. With this film, it creates a tension that forces the viewer to participate emotionally. On the other hand, the dialogue is so sparse, it becomes nearly impossible to connect with any of the characters. At the end of the movie I have to laugh when ""Written and directed by Gus Van Sant"" appears. Written? What did you write Gus? I'd love to see this screenplay. Blake walks through the woods. Blake puts on a dress. Blake mumbles. Other people get high and run around the house ignoring Blake. Blake dies. The end. Brilliant. This might be funny if I was joking, but there is no script for this movie. The actors literally make up their own dialogue.

Last Days may be a pointless experiment in film and seemingly a complete waste of time, but there's a mysterious quality about it that makes it not totally worthless. Van Sant's mastery of the camera and continuous shot allows the film to breathe in a way that sometimes makes the viewer feel tingly. While he takes advantage of his power to captivate audiences with what seem like 20-minute-long real-time moments of Blake staring into space, I find it hard not to take this time to put myself in this character's shoes. Could this be the point? Is there something to be learned after all? If the scene wasn't followed by a random gay sex scene with Lucas Haas and some other junky, I'd say yes. The fact is that although there are some clever and redeeming scenes, there just isn't enough material here to make up anything other than an artistic display of fine camera work.

I haven't given up on Van Sant, just yet. He's done some terrific work in the past and I still believe he's a fantastic director. From now on, however, I'll stick to the movies where he's let someone else do the writing.",1130803200,,4097,4.613168724279835

Then I am thrown into a homosexual scene that has no point. Van Sant must seriously despise Homosexuals.  Or is totally ashamed to be one himself, Or just likes to get off by casting young handsome men and then make them go at it to satisfy his perverted fantasies. This film which I believe was supposed to be the retelling of musical genius Kurt Cobain's last days (Michael Pitt is the only saving grace to this film, he is Cobain to the core. HE is terribly convincing, looks wise) But if you really want to know what Cobains Last Days were like you will not find out from this film. It has no point at all. Micheal Pitt is gloriously beautiful in any role that you put him in. Van Sant did one thing right by casting him. But I was completely failed once again by Van Sant who first failed me with the retelling of the Columbine Shootings in his Homosexual self serving ELEPHANT. I would be completely surprised if the remaining members of Nirvana were not completely offended by by the exploitation of their lives as nothing but meaningless. This film is terrible, I can not stress that enough.

This is the introduction to Blake, the main character in Gus Van Sants most recent film The Last Days. Blake immediately sticks out not like a sore thumb in the wilderness but a sore elephant. Something  completely at odds with place and time in the lush wooded serenity. Wandering the hills of his secluded estate like a ghost, a former shell of what might have been, Blake elusively evades creeping friends, phonecalls and goes virtually unkown to even his houseguests. The soundtrack is rich with ambience. Cupboard doors bash and bang, bushes rustle eerily like voices and dialogues fade in and out resonating through the empty castle. The only thing that is sorely missed is more of the music. There are brief glimpses into Blake's creative process but they are too shortly lived. Maybe this is Van Sant's point though, not all ghosts moan. Some of them whimper. This IS a slow paced movie by todays standards,  though when compared to Blockbusters crammed with enough stimulus, it's wholely refreshing and even tranquil. As the Cinematographer of the film Harris Savides explains, each scene doesn't need the action happening in frame, and we as an audience, can hopefully fill in the blanks ourselves becoming more active and glimpsing through the eyes of a fading man living out his ""last days"" Although this is no masterpeice by any means, Gus Van Sant continues to head somewhere brilliant cinematically and I, for one, am not complaining",1130284800,,1624,4.923357664233577

Anyways I found it funny you said Eddie wasn't the real thing, but Kurt was... I think a lot of people today think the opposite of that statement, me being one of them.  Oh, and no, Nsync wouldn't be considered the greatest band of all time, because there were still tons of more bands successful, Pearl Jam aswell was more successful... So you're either a kid or a fool, obviously.  You're much more likely to find people calling Kurt a phony than Eddie a phony, kid.

Why is Pearl Jam being talked about in discussion for a DVD relating to Kurt?  Can anyone explain to me any reasonable excuse for bringing up Pearl Jam in a Nirvana discussion?

Why can't you all just accept the fact that they were great? I am an enormous Pearl Jam fan, but I'm not blind in that Nirvana was a great band. Nirvana wasn't overrated, but Kurt Cobain was. Are we that blind to realize how much musical talent Dave Grohl has (and not to mention the fact that he has a little fun being famous)? But yet over and over again we're faced with the idea that Kurt Cobain was the only reason Nirvana was a band. I wouldn't say in a million years that Eddie Vedder is Pearl Jam. Eddie is as far from fake, I might add, as you can get. He can't be blamed for the ""one-after-another"" copycat bands to follow (like Creed, STP, Nickelback etc.). He isn't responsible for that. It's like blaming Red Hot for rap-metal, or Nirvana for Puddle of Mudd. It's absolutley ridiculous. Accept the fact that Eddie is a wonderful musician and deal with it. Fake? What fake artists fights Ticketmaster to support his fans, sells every bootlegged cd for his fans (you think the Fargo, ND bootleg really makes him a lot of money?), participates in Hurricane Katrina relief, Tibetan relief, the ONE organization, and a number of other foundations. How often did ""Oh I'm so sad because I'm famous"" Kurt Cobain offer help to the poorly deprived? Face it idiots! They were both great artists and there should be enough room (if your a fan of one of the other) in your heart for both of them. And Eddie Vedder overrated? Please, he's had to live in Kurt's shadow since his suicide made him a ""pop culture"" icon! (think Biggie and Tupac. Did you listen to them before they were shot? Nope.) And to the idiot that argued ""pop culture""...it is pop culture you putts...it doesn't mean they were pop music. Amen to the Seattle sound. I support it all.

Gus Van Sant's ""Last Days"" generated a mixed feeling in this reviewer's eyes.

Let's start with the good. I liked how Blake's death is shown as a slow process, finally ending with his death. He doesn't go out in a blast as does many other deaths depicted in movies do. Not all suicides or ODs go out in a blast. There are no police or people there to talk to the suicidal person. It is just him, and him alone. No witnesses... just like Cobain's suicide.

His anti-social, or total detachment from the real world, is perhaps depicted the best in this movie. Other movies show this type of behavior, too, but there's always outside noise and distractions present, possibly to keep the audience comfortable. The movie centers around Blake's own world... the way the world of a recluse is. I know this from personal experience. A quiet person makes people uncomfortable... Blake is the silent person, and we the audience therefore feel discomfort (which is most likely due to the fact that the camera following him around is boring, but isn't it just the same as hanging out with a really quiet person?). Gus Van Sant captured this behavior and feeling pitch-perfect.

Now for the dislikes: everything else. No characters with much personality and hardly any significance to the non-existant plot. Blake's mumbling becomes tiresome (must we endure that for 90+ minutes?). The briefly mentioned fact of no plot. And yes, it is a tedioum to sit through, and its 90+ minutes feels like an eternity.

Yes, this is ""loosely based on Kurt Cobain""... but Gus doesn't seem to know what that really means. C'mon... Blake wears the exact same outfits Kurt wore in his lifetime... even a woman's dress! Blake also has the exact same hairdo Kurt donned... and coincidentally enough, sings just like Kurt.

The song Blake sings isn't until the movie is nearly over... and I think everything the movie is about lies in that song. Sure, before we see people wanting to seek some benefit from Blake (maybe contributing to his depression), and Kim Gordon's cameo tells us that at least one person cares for Blake, but they're so unclear due to Blake's mumbling.

We don't really know what made Blake this way, nor do we know how he exactly dies (complete with his soul climbing into heaven)... all that matters is that we see how Blake is during his last days on Earth. Like what Richard Roeper said, perhaps Blake's first 27 years are more interesting than his last three days.

Plus, what's with the gay sex scene? No, I'm not homophobic, but... why show it at all?

Most people will loathe this movie... only about 10 people will love it. Some subtle parts are good, kinda funny at times, but overall, everything else sucks.

The DVD sucks, too. Basically bare bones with a behind-the-scenes featurette that'll put you to sleep faster than the movie itself. Haven't seen the deleted scene(s), but I assume they too suck.",1130198400,,3129,4.745856353591161
2397836,3,B000AYEL10,"I suggest you learn how to correctly write the English language before your next review.  First of all, anyone who references ""Pop Culture"" as the basis for forming an opinion doesn't understand music.  If pop culture determined what is or is not great music, then N'Sync would be considered the greatest band of all time.  Second, ""Ten"" was released less than a month before ""Nevermind"", so spare us the idea that Pearl Jam led the way for Nirvana.  Listen to any Pearl Jam album and you'll hear basically the same song 10 times.  I like Pearl Jam but if any band is overrated it's them (overrated is one word, not two, genius).  Pearl Jam in concert?  It's like watching a guy who is constipated for hours and listening to him whine about life.  Fake passion is very transparent.  Whether you like Nirvana or not, at least you knew you were getting the real Kurt Cobain.  That is what makes music great - real passion and honesty in the writing.  Finally, you say Gus Van Sant is an ""artsy"" director with no talent.  You lose all credibility when you say that.

Both bands have their supporters and their detractors, but no one can take away from the fact that they were both very different, very talented, and only have the ""Seattle stigma"" to connect them.  People seem to forget near the end of Cobain's life that both Cobain and Eddie Vedder had a mutual respect for each other, only able to occur after both of them dropped their pretenses and actually paid attention and learned what the other was really doing.

This movie wasn't my favorite of his - it pales in comparison to more widely appealed films like Milk and Good Will Hunting - but it wasn't bad. Pitt delivers an inspired if someone copycatish performance as Blake, an obvious homage to the late great Kurt Cobain, spending his final days in a drug fueled downward spiral leading up to the somewhat disappointing crescendo of his own suicide.

Overall the acting in the film is good. You'll see lots of recognizable actors. But the script they were given to work with must have been minimal - if it existed at all. So much of the film seems like forced improvisation. The actors seem to have been put in front of the camera and told to act without much direction at all. For this reason, the film can feel like it's dragging at times and jumps between scenes can be disjointed and bulky.

The thought didn't occur to me that this could be about Kurt Cobain until 30 minutes in because the description said nothing about it, but then it dawned on me based on Michael Pitt's appearance.  I'm not sure if this is how Kurt really conducted himself but I'm surely hoping it's not because he comes across like a complete loser.  Assuming this story is based around the life of Kurt, shame on the movie writers for painting a false picture of a musician.

I'm about to describe what the entire movie's like with the following- we see a young drugged out man quietly walking through the woods, building campfires, coming home to grab a gun and point it at his roommates while they sleep (or whoever those people were), put on a dress, fire up a cigarette, do some drugs, stumble around, fall down, make a bowl of cereal and stick the cereal box in the refrigerator (hehe), swat at imaginary bugs, have discussions with businessmen (finally, some actual talking!), ignore phone calls about his rock band ambitions and finances, and dodge religious kids.  Oh and he likes to pass out by doors so his friends can see him when they open the doors.  Meanwhile, for the second half of the movie, his friends sit around doing drugs listening to Velvet Underground albums.  Oh and if this sounds exciting, imagine some of these events repeating twice.  Ouch.

What a movie... not.  There is no story to speak of and the movie makes it look like being a fan of Nirvana is for drugged out lousy losers.  I take offense to that and so should you.  Horrible.
