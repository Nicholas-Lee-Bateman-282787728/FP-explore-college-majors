1884255,5,B00009MEDN,"This is an exact duplicate of the ""Hard To Handle"" Laserdisc. It isn't the same great audio/visual quality but it is the same performance. It is a stunning show - Bob is great. It appears that he may have ""taken"" a little something because as the show moves along, he seems a bit ""messed up"". He begins to stare off into the crowd with a blank expression. It is cool. In the Garden is supurb. The cover photo is from the 1970's. Kinda weird. All in all it is fantastic.",1058313600,9,469,4.222222222222222
1884256,5,B00009MEDN,"This DVD is made up of performances from Dylan's tour of Australia in 1986.  Songs in order of appearance are:  In The Garden; Just Like A Woman; Like A Rolling Stone; It's Allright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding); Girl From The North Country;  Lenny Bruce;  When The Night Comes Falling; Ballad Of A Thin Man; I'll Remember You; Knockin' On Heaven's Door.
One thing which took me by surprise when I received my copy, was that the notes on the packaging, plus the legal notice and menus on the DVD, are in Portuguese.
The DVD is made for Region 1 and it does play very well on my U.S. standard equipment.  It is 60 minutes long.  Audio is Dolby Digital - 2.0 Stereo - 5.1 Dolby Surround.
The front cover is in English, and it does say BOB DYLAN:  HEARTBREAKERS LIVE IN AUSTRALIA.  When the DVD does begin playing, the title HARD TO HANDLE appears at the beginning...for some reason....
Tom Petty does appear in several of the numbers, playing guitar in most and singing harmony in some.
The song titles in the menu, and the closing credits, are all in English.  There was no insert inside the case.  Since it probably would have been in Portuguese, anyway, I guess it doesn't matter.
As for the DVD itself, I really enjoyed the performances.  They fall in Dylan's Christian phase, which I found interesting.  I am a newly-minted Dylan fan, so this material is fresh to me--in fact, I was unfamiliar with a number of the songs before I saw them performed by way of this DVD.  I thought the camera work was well done, the sound excellent, and the choice of material outstanding.  If I had seen this DVD before buying it, I would have been even more eager to get my own copy.
As previously mentioned, although I am a contemporary of Dylan's, I had not really followed his career, until a year ago, when I was loaned a copy of ""Love and Theft"".  I was captivated by the CD, and only now have begun to discover what else is available on the market.  Therefore, I look forward to comments/reviews from other Dylan fans of long-standing who have more material for comparison.",1054684800,21,2059,4.494623655913978
1884257,4,B00009MEDN,"This concert was taken from the 86 Hard to Handle Tour in which Bob was touring with Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. It was filmed in Austrailia for what I believe was originally aired as an HBO concert special.
Be warned this is eighties Bob, a thing which some are quick to disregard, I for one enjoy all periods of the cannon and this is a good snaphot of this time period.
The setlist is as follows: In the Garden, Just Like A Woman, Like A Rolling Stone, It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), Girl From The North Country, Lenny Bruce, When The Night Comes Falling, Ballad of A Thin Man, I'll Remember You, Knockin' On Heaven's Door.
This DVD is an import. No special features. The main menu is in Spanish, but there are no subtitles or overdubs in the feature.
The Heartbreakers are featured in the performance as the backing band. Tom helps out on harmony vocal on a couple of songs.
During this tour Bob had background singers with him. I usually hate this but they do provide something special during ""When The Night Comes Falling"".
If you are a true Dylan fan this should be in your collection. I would suggest picking it up soon. Being an import it has strong potential to go out of print.",1054339200,16,1199,4.429864253393665

7991438,4,B00009MEDN,Hard to handle.  Delivers a concert in color and stereo.  Dylan's  concerts are a hard to find item in DVD.  I am very pleased with this product.  Not a perfect production of this concert but it is nicely done and I am very happy I found it.  1986 DYLAN AND PETTY ERA. Australia  production.  One hour of good concert.,1365984000,2,318,4.271186440677966
7991439,5,B00009MEDN,My son is a Bob Dylan fan and he has many of his albums. We were looking for something he did not have and spotted this. He was very happy with it.,1365033600,,147,3.625
7991440,4,B00009MEDN,"This is a great concert if you are a true Bob Dylan Fan!  It has a young Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as a backup for Dylan, who is at the top of his game.  This concert, I believe, it from the late 60's or early 70's and features some of Dylans great hits, Lay Lady Lay, Knocking on Heaven's Door.  Don't expect ""blowing in the Wind"" or other earlier hits.  The concert may seem not as polished as later concerts by Dylan or other groups, but it still delivers.",1346544000,,465,4.133333333333334

7991442,4,B00009MEDN,"I saw the show, so it means a bit more to me, but this is Dylan (with Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers as the backing band) in great form. Need I say more?",1211673600,,154,3.696969696969697
7991443,2,B00009MEDN,"I bought this 'Glass Music' DVD of 'Hard to Handle' to replace my USA CBS/Fox VHS tape and was NOT pleased with the quality.  Both video and audio were dull compared to the VHS, so I returned it.  I think that the original DVD transfer was just poorly done.  If you have no other source, this is a great concert (I caught the Dylan/Petty tour in Philadelphia) and you may want to get the DVD anyway.",1196208000,12,399,4.223684210526316

7991445,5,B00009MEDN,"Great opening song..In the Garden. I am pleased he still regards Jesus Christ as his ""hero"". Amazing to see how he leads the band..especially on the opening of ""Knocking on Heavens Door"". Fantastic guitar playing on ""I'm only bleeding"". One of the best live concerts on DVD.  Where are the other songs he did at this concert?",1188518400,4,325,4.701754385964913
7991446,2,B00009MEDN,"This Brazilian import is a retitled but direct copy of the out-of-print Bob Dylan video ""Hard To Handle,"" a document of his 1986 Australian tour backed by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers.  Unfortunately there is very little Bob on official DVD, so the less than stellar video and audio on this release is very disappointing.  Hopefully a better version will be released by Sony/Columbia.  In the meantime if you have the VHS version it's better than this. If you don't have the VHS, than you should get this at least for the performance.",1060732800,18,535,4.731182795698925
