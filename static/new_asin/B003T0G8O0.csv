8404889,5,B003T0G8O0,"I have learned how to read faces! I had first bought the book, Your Face Tells All and thoroughly enjoyed it. Then I saw there was a dvd he also made. The Your Face Tells All dvd is by far the best to date and was far more comprehensive than others. Easy for me to follow and understand, definitely a great learning tool!
I strongly recommend getting the book and dvd as they really compliment each other.
