Inge Thomson on everything but .......no, maybe she does use the kitchen sink.....Stephen, Karine's brother on electric and acoustic guitars and Karine on guitar and vocals and commentary, telling us where she is both physically and mentally. A superb insight into the different tunes lined up for your enjoyment. A glimpse around her part of Scotland with Prestonpans and Salters Road, which is a song on here that is quite exceptional. They drive along the back roads, pull over, out come the instruments and here come songs of true beauty with birds singing around them as they perform.
There are songs in her home recording studio and inside too.  All are tales of love of nature, love lost and found and gorgeous accompaniment surrounding you in waves of visual and aural textures that are transporting you to this World of folk, Scottish song and truly inspired playing and performing. ....pure magic....",1478476800,,996,4.9640718562874255
