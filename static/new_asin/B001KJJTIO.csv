3665749,3,B001KJJTIO,"The reason I got this dvd was because I loved another 10 Minute Solution dvd by Amy Bento (the instructor in this one).  I felt this wasn't quite as challenging for me.  I'm only 5' tall and I think the figure 8 bands that come with this are meant for a taller person.  I didn't get enough resistance from it.  I prefer 10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones.  That one comes with a resistance band that is easier to change the difficulty.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Tone-Trouble-Zones/dp/B000RIWASK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones</a>",1365552000,4,636,6.022222222222222
3665750,5,B001KJJTIO,These are perfect exercises for we who are over 60yrs-old who need to get back into shape. The equipment is so portable; comes in handy anywhere we have the time.,1315612800,2,162,4.433333333333334
3665751,4,B001KJJTIO,"I thought that the video was very good.  Great instruction.  I would have liked for the figure 8 to have had more resistance in some exercises.  It was fine for most, but I missed a little more resistance from it in some exercises.  I must add, however, that I have been lifting weights 3 times a week for 8yrs.  This product might be an excellent challenge for someone who doesn't lift weights or is a beginner.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",1280448000,3,450,4.426829268292683
3665752,5,B001KJJTIO,"I'm disabled from a car wreck so I almost didn't get this dvd. Lots of exercises I just can't do because of my leg. Most of the exercises on this DVD I could do just fine though! I used a pillow under my knee when I needed to be on my knees for part of the workout. Most of the exercises are done standing and sitting. A few are done on the knees and positioned like doing a push-up. The push-up positions I skipped, but still felt like I had an awesome workout. I hold on to a chair for some of the standing ones, but can still feel the burn of the workout. I give it 5 stars because even handicap, I'm able to do 90% of it which is better than I can say for most workout DVD's.",1266624000,4,679,3.857142857142857
3665753,2,B001KJJTIO,"The figure 8 bands are cheesy and offer almost no resistance.  The foam slips around and it is uncomfortable to do the exercises with the band around your feet or ankles unless you're wearing shoes.  She goes from exercise to exercise and pose to pose without giving you much time to regroup.  Almost no warm up.  Also quite a few of the exercises require pretty decent balance so if you're out of shape or uncoordinated it's hard to follow along.  Being that it's only 10 minute snippets I thought this was geared for my demographic--housewives trying to get back into shape or whatnot.  It seems like this is more for someone who is already in shape, however the exercises are so low-impact (due to being centered around the ""no resistance"" band) that I can't see how they'd be satisfying for someone at an intermediate level.",1264636800,4,828,4.675862068965517
3665754,4,B001KJJTIO,"I bought this item because the bands seemed less impact than traditional weights.  I was impressed with the personalized aspect of the DVD and how one can mix and match workouts.

The bands are my only complaint - the yellow band hardly gives any resistance at all and they are definitely not a one size fits all product.  Amy is obviously much taller than 5 feet as I had to work from the middle of the band for some of the upper body just to feel ""the burn"".

It's a really easy workout to follow, I like how she moves quickly.  It's get my heart rate up and I break a sweat without hurting myself the way the Firm tapes do.  I like the trainer's attitude, very upbeat and supportive without sounding like a drill instructor.

I like this DVD so much, I bought the other items featuring this trainer.  I would say buy your own bands seperately to give yourself more resistance.",1252454400,2,879,4.3496932515337425
3665755,5,B001KJJTIO,"I can't complain this dvd delivers the high energy and burn your looking for I would agree with the previous viewer this is more of an intermediate fitness dvd. 10 minute solution is a leader in bringing the time saving fitness dvds we all need especially me a mother of four . I can do on most days three to four segments sometimes I'll do two early morning and two late afternoon. I tend to get bored very easy , so I mix and match the 10 minute solution dvds. For example, On Monday I'll do lower body , cardio & abs. Tuesday 3 cardio segments 1 ab segment etc. I have to stay focused and mixing it up helps me achieve that. The figure 8 band is Awesome and very effective in reaching that OH!! Sh** stage !!!! HA HA :). Love IT.",1250467200,,732,4.090277777777778
3665756,5,B001KJJTIO,"I am (I guess) what you'd call an intermediate-level exerciser, as I'm not where I want to be but I'm definitely past the beginner's stage.  I've completed the entire video one time, and WHEW!  I'm feelin' it!  Don't let the seemingly-light Figure 8's fool you.  When I first pulled them out of the box, my first thought was to return the whole package because I couldn't see any possible way they'd work.  However, I went against my first impression and did the workout today, and it's most certainly a keeper.

The first time you do this workout (any or all of the segments), you may find it helpful to keep both Figure 8 bands handy so that you can gauge which resistance level you need for the exercises.  Keep the remote close by, too, as the instructor tends to move a bit quickly through some of the moves.

One thing I like is that this video incorporates strength training moves that aren't usually a part of my workout.  Although some more advanced exercisers may not find them challenging, I was pleasantly surprised as I worked through 8 reps plus 8 ""burn reps"" of each move.  One of the only drawbacks I found was that during some of the floor/leg work, the Figure 8 doesn't exactly want to stay in place as it should...this, I think, is going to be a matter of just getting used to the move and being careful with the positioning of the band.  Also, if the resistance isn't hard enough for you, let go of the handle of the band and grab hold onto the bands themselves--this helped me when I felt that I needed more ""oomph"" in the move.

So, if you're looking for a sculpting video that's outside of your normal routine, don't be afraid to give this one a try.  I'm looking forward to my next workout with it!",1242432000,12,1722,4.4113924050632916
3665757,4,B001KJJTIO,"I really like this workout.  I usually use 5 lb weights, and I felt it in my arms.  What I did, was pull the band further than she does or I would not have felt it.
The drawbacks are that the bands are not that strong, even though the red is the stronger.  Also, she moves between exercises quickly and you have to keep taking the bands on and off and there hardly any time to do it.
The leg workout would be better if the band was stronger.
Overall its a very good workout and its a great change from the weights, it really relieves the boredrom factor.",1225929600,12,554,4.064220183486238

8315048,4,B001KJJTIO,I have not tried the whole dvd. How ever I liked the one I tried. Though the figure 8's seem a little weak and I might invest in a more sturdier one. I think that would make a big difference. I do not notice a difference between the yellow or the red as in resistance.,1472083200,,268,3.890909090909091
8315049,1,B001KJJTIO,Please delete.  I don't want the dvd.,1449273600,,37,4.285714285714286
8315050,5,B001KJJTIO,going to look great soon.  Seems easy to work with,1432684800,,50,4.0
8315051,3,B001KJJTIO,"This video was good at first but after a few times of doing it, it was no longer challenging.  Maybe this video is for a true beginner.  I am a little disappointed in the figure 8 it doesn't have enough resistance for me.",1425081600,3,221,4.116279069767442
8315052,2,B001KJJTIO,"I'm actually worried that these will snap and leave my face looking like the Phantom of the Opera. Very dubious quality. I would say ""low"" but it's not as if I've conducted a stress test; maybe they're tougher than they look. I'm not going 1 star because a) if someone is looking for a very light resistance product then maybe this is your thing, and b) I do find one of the bands useful for doing some light tricep exercises.

If I could go back in time, I'd invest in higher quality bands. In fact, this may be a ""in person"" sort of purchase so that you can assure yourself of the quality and make certain you get the weight resistance you actually need.",1398988800,,656,4.290322580645161
8315053,5,B001KJJTIO,"I use this DVD to start up my day. It is 5 diffrent workouts to chose from or do them all at once. I do 10 min. each day to start of. The workout is good and well explained how to do, so everyone  can do it.",1391472000,,207,3.404255319148936
8315054,5,B001KJJTIO,Fantastic workout.  Do it 2 days a week and Leslie Sansome Walk At Home 3 days a week.  Works for me!,1377388800,,101,3.761904761904762
