6389413,1,B00JRCQB3W,Horrible. While i know the intent behind this may have been good. I only watched to see if this movie would would get any better. There were some decent attempts to make this movie watchable but they all failed in a blazing fire.,1419811200,,229,4.348837209302325

6389415,1,B00JRCQB3W,"The story centers around Meshach Johnson (Raheem Saltmarshall) a smack dealer in Saginaw. He works with his Pops, and had been in the business too long. He has a girlfriend who has the means to take him away from the city, but Meshach stays there apparently for the lap dances he gets from heroin addicts.

The movie is heavy into the theme of redemption, building up your race rather than tear it down. There are readings from Frederick Douglas to inspire. The production was hampered by the low budget. Sound quality was poor. The opening soundtrack drowned out Meshach's monologue. The police interrogation room had a bad echo and what was that ridiculously scripted female officer tough guy scene? The opening has a man being shot and then they start to dig a hole in the backyard on broad daylight. I mean, the town has a river. The CG gun fire and noise was very bad.

The slow action was interrupted by poorly executed message scenes. Acting was on the low end of the scale.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, lap dances. Near nudity.",1405728000,2,1036,4.6502732240437155
