6991614,5,B00O2R6NX0,Haven't opened it yet to see if thwy actually play but I doubt there will be a problem. This is an Xmas gift so well wait and see. I do love the double feature box because its the same style as the cars double feature box and my son loves both planes and cars so I'm positive this will be another favorite in his collection.

6991619,2,B00O2R6NX0,"I searched for Planes DVD, this was the top of my list, so I bought the 2 pack instead of buying each video individually. Once It got to my house I realized it was Blue Ray, not a DVD so I was very disappointed. I do not own a blue ray player which is why I searched specifically for ""Planes DVD"". not necessarily disappointed in the product, disappointed in Amazon for having a search that allows a Blue ray to be at the top of a DVD search.",1493251200,,442,4.034090909090909
