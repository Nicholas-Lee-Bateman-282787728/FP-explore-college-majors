Enough going on it it that even people who don't know cars won't be bored, enough REAL hot rods and kustoms that someone who does know won't snear.

You have to get this DVD! It may even get you laid in Canada.",1114646400,,277,4.0181818181818185
2288976,5,B0009G2KKI,"Traditional hot rodding at its best. This DVD is a true glimpse into the the kustom and hot rod lifestyle. BE WARNED: you will be inspired to buy a rusty old car and dedicate your life to making it the coolest one of a kind car that you can.

Get 2 copies. One for you to watch and one to give to your best friend. I also strongly recommend the soundtrack for your car. It was much better than Cats. I would watch it again and again. Viva La HAMB.",1114646400,,447,3.966666666666667
2288977,5,B0009G2KKI,I learned about this DVD on the HAMB ([...]) and can honestly say that nothing captures the essence of hot rods quite like this DVD. It should be required watching for anyone into using their hands to make art.... cuz that's the focus... the ART.,1114646400,5,246,4.488888888888889
8060115,5,B0009G2KKI,"Well, they did it again! The music, the images, the partys, the interviews, the cars... ohhhh, the cars! If you are into cars, nostalgia, attitude and art, you simply can't go wrong!",1336780800,,182,4.71875
8060116,5,B0009G2KKI,As (...) as the first one was. You would have to be a big (...) moron not to get the 2nd one!!! Finally some entertainment that solely focuses on the cars and not the whiny (...) bitching and crying about deadlines other nonsense..,1114732800,,231,4.395348837209302
8060117,5,B0009G2KKI,"A DVD so unbelievably good that it captivates even my 3 year old boy. But then again his dad's a hardcore hotrodder, he says ""I wanna see the hot rod DVD"" I, of course oblige.

This is as far removed from the cliche filled nonsense of 'reality' hot rod and bike shows it isn't even worth comparing the two.

If you're in a slump during your project put this DVD on and you'll get the motivation you need to keep on going.

The music's really good too and the girlies ain't half bad.

This DVD is great viewing even if you're not into hotrodding because it affords a glimpse into the brotherhood that's part of this hobby.

The scenes from Sweden with guys thrashing priceless American iron within an inch of their lives shows just how passionate some of us are about what we do.

You've gotta buy this thing, it rules.",1114732800,2,818,4.348684210526316
8060118,5,B0009G2KKI,"A friend turned me on to MadFab1 and I dug it, so I was eager to get my hands on MadFab2. This thing rocks! Like others said, expect to walk away from this DVD with a strong desire to get greasy in the garage. If you're into cars and stuff, this is definitely the antidote for Discovery Channel 'Hot Rod Diarrhea'... real rock-n-roll, cool cars, cooler people, and a little sexy pin-up action for good measure. Get it.",1114646400,,418,4.371794871794871
8060119,5,B0009G2KKI,"If you found and are reading this, you already know what it's all about - this one will not disappoint.  I think I watched it three times the first night I got it!  LOTS of traditional rod footage from shows, interviews with star car builders, and even a ""Monster Rod"" marathon build-up.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Even better than the first.",1114646400,,344,4.683333333333334
8060120,5,B0009G2KKI,"This DVD is an awesome example of the ""REAL"" Hot Rodding and the Custom Culture...!  In depth interviews with the original Kings of customizing.  Features some of the Best car shows from around the world all set to the driving beat of the new generation Hot Rodders and Customizers! Great gift for the hardcore Hot Rodder without the drama Queens of television ""Build Shows""...!!!",1114646400,,380,4.921875
8060121,5,B0009G2KKI,"i bought both volumes of mfs and the soundtrack.

the movies are filled with very cool cars and very cool people.

i highly recomend them.",1114646400,,138,4.48
8060122,5,B0009G2KKI,"I got both DVDs the CD and a patch! The MFS is one of those great experiences that you may stumble upon in life....and will never regret. Rock-a-billy, traditional hot-rods, builders, shows, bands, interviews, and general mayhem. Makes me want to quit my job an build cars full time. If you secretly or openly obsess about traditional hot-rod cars, this is for you.",1114646400,,365,4.809523809523809
8060123,5,B0009G2KKI,"Can't seem to make any progress in the garage? Projects sitting for years on end? Tired of hearing ""what'cha doin with all that junk?"" Watch this DVD and all your problems will be solved! (except male pattern baldness and occasional incontinence) You'll want to get out into the garage and start working right away.

Seriously though, Volume 1 and 2 give a peek into the world that is traditional hot rodding. I recommend them to anyone who has even a passing interest in old hot rods.",1114646400,,485,4.6395348837209305
8060124,5,B0009G2KKI,"By far the coolest Hot Rod DVD known to man. These guys do it in spades. These MFS DVD's are always being played at my house. Cool interviews with legends of hot rodding and culture icons, all the coolest car show & event coverage, the best music/soundtrack ever. Can't ask for more.",1114646400,,283,4.461538461538462
