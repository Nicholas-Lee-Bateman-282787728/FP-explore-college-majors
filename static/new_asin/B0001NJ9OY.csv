Thirteen of these are WARNER Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.
PARAMOUNT (and one FLEISCHER) Popeye animations make up the balance.
All are from unrestored film stock.

8182480,1,B0001NJ9OY,"~* I really agree with the other reviewer !!

The quality is really bad & the packaging was extremely cheap!  I took a gamble on this one, because I didn't see any reviews posted here and knew nothing about this DVD.

I purchased it at the time Warner Brothers was releasing the Looney Tunes Golden Box set!!  So i was on a cartoon kick !!  Had a read even one bad review I would have saved my money !

This really just isn't worth spending money on, my dvd is just laying there in the back of my Cabinet  :)",1118448000,,508,4.02
8182481,2,B0001NJ9OY,"I recommend that you buy one of the following instead:

more money: looney toons golden collection

less money: asinB00063QD6G classic cartoons DVD

The other ones are longer and better and the sound is not out  of sync.",1099958400,5,220,4.864864864864865
