8112690,3,B000EQ5T1K,"I did not finish it because I became bored.  Some of the questions and answers were amusing, but mostly it was a cross section of different belief systems reiterated...from non believers to deeply faithful believers. I think it could have been effective if it had been shorter because some of these young child actors were tremendously wise in what they answered.  For that reason, I rate is as okay.  There is insight to be gained if you are willing to wade through more generic reasoning we are all used to hearing.",1377561600,,517,4.65934065934066
8112691,1,B000EQ5T1K,"What a disappiontment!!  It has very little information on the Movie -the
Passion, very little of the Cast and Crew and their feelings- a major miss representation
trying to cash in on a buck- SHAME!!!

Simply AWFUL!!!!!",1252627200,2,220,4.918918918918919
8112692,1,B000EQ5T1K,"If you were looking for a video with serious interviews about God, this is not the one. Don't buy it. This is a strange and weird salad of thoughts about God, not well connected. It may be a good visual experiment but all the interviews are cut and mixed and you cannot get a real glimpse of anyone's thoughts. I don't really understand the purpose of this video, full of relativism about God.

Si buscabas un video sobre entrevistas sobre Dios, este no es. Esto es una rara ensalada de pensamientos sobre Dios y ademas no bien conectadas. No lo compres.",1226793600,2,554,4.485148514851486
8112693,4,B000EQ5T1K,"This is a very thoughtful and charming documentary directed by Francesco Cabras and Alberto Molinari. Of the cast and crew from the motion picture ""The Passion of Christ"" get asked about their own personal beliefs and faith when it comes to God. Over 200 people were interviewed. Everyone from Jews, to Christians, to Muslims, to Atheists, to people who are still looking for the answers give a very open and honest take on the big theological questions we all ask at least once in our lifetime. Yet, the best part about this documentary is that it is not preachy, rather, we merely sit back and listen to people's individual life experiences and stories. There is a rich pallet of ideas as we hear people's frank and personal opinions about God, Religion, and how they see the world around them.

This documentary consistently remains thoughtful, never breaks into a sermon, but lets us think and come to our own conclusions. Instead of trying to force the concepts on us, we learn from others, and as God would have it allows us to freely make the choice to come to Him. This film is more about a discourse than any one specific message, but if it has a message it is that we all are wonderful and unique as human beings.",1161302400,13,1223,4.584474885844749
8112694,3,B000EQ5T1K,"Definately not what I expected. Lots of poignant questions, but not much in the way of thoughtful answers. They asked the cast and crew of The Passion questions about their religious beliefs. Do you believe in God? Do you believe in Heaven? Do you believe in miracles?  And many more such questions. Many answers were brief or vague or unrelated to the question at hand. However, there were a few thoughtful answers worth listening to. Much of the film was artsy filming, a lone dog wandering around in a scenic area, sunsets, that sort of thing. Overall, I have to say I didn't get much from it, although someone else might. I doubt if I would watch it more than once.",1156377600,7,669,4.528925619834711
