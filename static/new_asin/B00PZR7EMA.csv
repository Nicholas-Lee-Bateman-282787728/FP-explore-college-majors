He goes WAY to fast- pretty much just does the move once at normal speed but says what he's doing at the same time and then he's done and goes onto the next move. My husband and I had to constantly hit stop and rewind. There really is no breakdown of the steps. The moves are cool, just wish it was broken down. Returning this DVD.",1493510400,,444,3.9444444444444446
8689887,3,B00PZR7EMA,"Watch out! The descriptions for ALL of these videos use the same line, saying ""This 2-DVD set..."" This is NOT a 2-DVD set! It only comes with 1-DVD. Don't get fooled like I did. I've asked them to change the description but I see now that's not going to happen. Too bad because the instruction isn't all that bad.",1474156800,2,313,4.322033898305085
