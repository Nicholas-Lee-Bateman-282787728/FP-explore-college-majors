6284831,4,B00IPDJN8E,"While masterpieces like La Bohme, Tosca and Madama Butterfly need no special pleading, Puccini's contribution to the opera as pure entertainment is one that is often undervalued, and his compositional gifts consequently are often underestimated.  Turandot, for example, with its fairytale plot, has all the elements for a grand entertainment but doesn't seem to offer much of human interest. If it's not dealt with effectively, it can be just a mess of Orientalist clichs, with situations calculated specifically to run through the numbers, all built around the showcase aria of 'Nessun dorma'. A cold and cruel Princess, with a series of riddles for suitors who will be executed should they fail, whose heart is melted by a valiant Prince, this is Life, Death and Love writ large with very little in the way of genuine human sentiments. Or so it seems. Li is of course the saving grace on that front, her sense of honour, duty and love igniting feelings of compassion in the Princess Turandot, and it similarly opens a way to the heart of the audience.

And this, while it seems sentimental and calculated to put it in those terms, is primarily the strength of Puccini. He always finds a way to touch the heart of the listener, and more than just being entertainment, that's the critical element that needs to be in place. If it doesn't obviously provide the necessary heart, Andrei Serban's production for the Royal Opera house (dating back to 1984) at least exploits the entertainment value of Turandot, with all its Oriental exoticism and regal glamour. The set is grand but unfussy, requiring no major set changes just the addition of props - pagodas, masks and banners - between scenes. The background is however surprisingly dark, and doesn't show off the full impact of the set. The costumes are typically bold Serban primary colours, and full use is made of the stage with good blocking of the characters with masked dancers to add life and movement.

There's nothing here in this production or in the performances however to make you sit up and be willing to explore the qualities that are there in the work and find the warm heart behind it. It all feels a little perfunctory, and it's not just the fairy tale element or the use of masks that make it somewhat inscrutable. Henrik Nnsi's musical direction doesn't really manage to bring the score to life either, but it and the staging mainly provide the context for this production and they do that fairly well in the necessary places. 'Nessun dorma', for example, isn't overplayed as a showpiece but kept in its dramatic context. Li's death is most affecting here, as it must be, and Turdanot's discovery of the name that that has eluded her - not Calaf as much as Love - brings the work to an unquestionably powerful conclusion. The lack of imagination elsewhere however means that it's the singers who have to make up for the dramatic failings.

The singing performances themselves are good, but a little more dramatic direction however might have made a real difference. Marco Berti has all the right Italian tenor characteristics that you expect to hear in this role, even if it is clearly a stretch for him in places. More of a failing is his acting ability, and you don't really get a sense of the importance of his task of Calaf being emotionally engaged with the enormity of the riddle challenge and potentially facing death the next morning - it all seems more like an act of bravado than true love. Lise Lindstrom is very capable in an unquestionably tough role, but is a little on the strident side. There's plenty of ice but no fire of passion. A little more vulnerability would bring a little humanity to her Princess Turandot. Eri Nakamura is a fine Li, apparently light of voice but there's a robustness here and her top notes ring out beautifully. Raymond Aceto's Timur is solid, with clear enunciation in his deep bass.

The quality of the Blu-ray is, as expected from Opus Arte, of a typically high standard with a clear image and strong audio tracks go. The release also includes a 8-minute introduction and a 4-minute Behind the Masks feature on Ping, Pong and Pang. The performance can be played with these features included, or as separate Acts. There's a synopsis in the booklet, which also has a good essay by Linda Fairtile on the creation of Puccini's final opera which remained unfinished at his death. Like most, this version uses the final scene completed by Franco Alfano. The BD is Region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Korean.",1396310400,7,4559,4.802547770700637

6284833,5,B00IPDJN8E,"This version, beautifully staged by Romanian-born director Andrei Serban, is really stunning! Lise Lindstrom's a bit icy voice is a perfect choice for the role of Turandot. Italian tenor Marco Berti  has all the characteristics that you expect to hear as Prince Calaf. And the Japanese soprano Eri Nakamura as Li, what a beautiful voice! Let's hope to hear more of her in the future.

6284835,4,B00IPDJN8E,"Turandot is a spectacle, and this DVD certainly does it justice. As somebody relatively new to opera, I came to the DVD knowing relatively little about the production, but found it clear, engaging, and highly entertaining.

Fortunately for me, the DVD comes with optional subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish, Korean and Italian. Coupled with a printed synopsis inside the DVD packaging and an optional filmed introduction to Acts I and III, the plot was made easy to follow for opera newbies such as myself, without getting in the way of those familiar to it. I particularly enjoyed the filmed introductions, which featured interesting backstage and rehearsal footage, as well as interviews with the cast and production team. Whilst this was at times a little patronising, the enthusiasm of those involved and the exclusive behind the scenes glimpse made it a must see. This could be watched either at the start of the each act or as an extra, and was accompanied by a brief film of the cast members playing Ping, Pong and Pang in rehearsal (aptly named Behind the Mask).

Whilst reproducing operatic music artificially may seem to reduce some of the magic of the production, the sound was of a high quality and available both in digital or surround sound. The filming was also highly effective. Due to the detail of the production, the camera primarily focused on covering the entire stage, allowing the viewer to decide what to focus on. Nevertheless, it frequently zoomed in and out or switched angles, offering an added layer of movement to the production and revealing perspectives I never would have seen from my usual amphitheatre seat. This really added to the pantomime feel, proving the characters to be larger than life and engaging  Eri Nakamuras pained Li was particularly harrowing.

The production itself is real spectacle, complete with streamers, a gigantic gong and an enormous throne that lowers from the sky. I particularly enjoyed the tai chi inspired dancing, which constantly made the stage appear bustling yet controlled. Saying this, the production is at times a little too much, and is really showing its age in relation to its perception of the Orient. I also found the lighting frustratingly dark. Whilst the lighting designer, F. Mitchell Dana, explained in the Act I introduction it was created to resemble the night, I felt more variation was needed. Nevertheless, it was a powerful production, and it goes without saying that the singing was impeccable; surely a must see for any music/theatre lover, as well as a great way for those new to opera to start.",1403568000,,2598,4.993071593533488
6284836,5,B00IPDJN8E,"Lise Lindstrom is wonderful in this production of Turandot.  She is playing this role all over the world and you can she why, she is glorious, both vocally and she looks stunning.  I would like her to be not quite so stiff on stage and become more of an actress, if she did that, nothing could stop her.",1403308800,,303,4.206896551724138
6284837,5,B00IPDJN8E,"I sadly missed out on seeing this production at the cinema, and I daresay that, for those who managed to see it on the big screen, the small screen experience will be a bit disappointing. However, after saying that, for me this production was a wonderful experience, the finest performance that I have ever seen on DVD or live! The sumptuous sets and costumes transport you to a different world, and the excellent acting and singing only serves to further the enjoyment.
I really enjoyed Lise Lindstroms performance as Turandot, she is able to bring out, through her singing and acting, every nuance of the character of the princess, steely yet at times vulnerable. This is backed up by the perfect foil of Marco Bertis Calaf, and the rest of the cast, in which there isn't a single weak link. The Chorus and Orchestra of the Royal Opera House are also on fine form, and the wonderful direction of Andrei Serban makes this a production to savour.
The extras on this disc include the usual cast gallery as well as an informative introduction to the opera by Antonio Pappano, and a short piece entitled Behind the Masks, which again is an introduction to the opera only this time from the perspective of Ping, Pang and Pong, both of which, especially when combined with the fine booklet notes, give some insight into the opera as well as this production.
This production is a feast for both eyes and the ears, I have been told that the original 1984 ROH production is preferable, but in my opinion this present version would be hard to beat! Highly recommended!",1402272000,2,1559,4.672727272727273

6284839,5,B00IPDJN8E,I saw this production in London at the Royal Opera House in September. It was wonderful. Visually stunning and vocally I couldn't have asked for more. Plus the woman who sat next me let out rooms in her house and one of the singers was a lodger. I loved the cast. I couldn't wait to get back into the theatre for the next act. I am planning on getting this DVD.,1400544000,,361,4.098591549295775
6284840,3,B00IPDJN8E,"There is no denying Puccini's glorious music and this superb Blu-Ray edition that is crisp and sharp and beautiful. But how do I review this production? I saw a lavish and spectacular production at the Met several years ago that had stayed with me ever since. And no one ever since can hit the vocal range and the power and passion of ""Nessum Dorma"" like Pavarotti. I saw him in person sing that aria and he literally sent chills through me.

I had high hopes for this 2013 Royal Opera House production and I found much to be desired. I found the sets quite different and somewhat lavish, but I though the lighting was extremely dark and the costumes not very impressive. I also thought the 3 leads very unappealing and the singer who sang Liu had the ugliest mouth I'd ever seen. It looked deformed, but she had a great voice. The Calaf's Nessum Dorma lacked the power to stun you, plus his Act 3 costume looked like a big red sack with Eskimo boots.

I wanted this new stunning Blu-Ray edition to be something very special and it wasn't qute for me. ""Turandot"" is one of my very favorite operas and the production has to be perfect for me and this wasn't. I wished they would Blu-Ray the Met's production.",1400025600,3,1207,4.4324324324324325
6284841,4,B00IPDJN8E,"I still look forward to the day when an Asian singer is chosen to take on the role of Turandot (and Calaf too). We have had several excellent Asian Lius and on Blu-ray it is not unreasonable to look for some realism to go with the art! This is already acknowledged by the use of masks which have been around in one form or another for decades. Meanwhile the American soprano Lise Lindstrom is certainly the first Turandot on video to get anywhere near a realistic visual interpretation of the role and produces a splendid performance in this new Blu-ray from Covent garden. Without doubt the best Turandot on video there has ever been. Unfortunately she is offset by the dismal Marco Berti as Calaf. Berti is virtually devoid of any acting skills and every scene is played straight with almost zero facial expression and body language. His voice is no Pavarotti but it is not good enough to block out his appalling acting. He was on the Valencia Blu-ray and has not improved any since then. The tiny Eri Nakamura as Liu is excellent but so is Hyeseoung Kwon on the Opera Australia release.

This production uses masks throughout and they are very effective. You realise this even more when they take them off at the final curtain and you see what a huge variety of faces appear! Together with the costumes  the masks give a consistent oriental flavour to this production. Only the rather western acrobatics give the game away that those behind the masks are not Chinese! This gives this production a decided visual advantage over the Australian and Spanish sets where the cast look like Europeans in Chinese dress, (which of course is what most of them are!) Turandot's three henchmen, Ping, Pang and Pong are played with a lightness that was a bit too light for me, (I slightly preferred the excellent Australians here), but they go well with the production.

The days where singers could waddle on, sing and waddle off are gone for video forever and Blu-ray is already bringing us an increasing realism in casting. Opera is not just about singing, important as that is, acting and a realistic visual impression are equally important. This is overall a very fine performance and should definitely be preferred over the Valencia set. The Australian production has a weak Turandot but Rosario La Spina has a lot more fire than Berti and there are many attractive aspects to this production.

On the presentation side the transfer of both picture and sound is very good. The picture is a bit dark for me but that is the way the director wanted it. My only complaint is with the mastering: Play options include the verbal introductions and the only way they can be skipped is by activating two clicks of the remote for act I and one click for the remaining scene changes or using the act options, but they then return to the main menu at the end of each act and that is even worse. This is a stupid idea. The set could also do with more chapter points to increase access at key moments. Overall this must now be the best Turandot on video, perhaps just a whisker ahead of the Opera Australia production but both are really very good, I have them both. Despite many attractive things the Valencia disc now drops off my radar as the Armenian Guleghina is visually too powerful and there is also the stuffed Berti. The Met production is at the bottom of my Blu-ray list and should not be considered.",1398816000,4,3393,4.621890547263682
8644466,4,B00IPDJN8E,"Enjoyable contrast to other, more even performances..

I liked this production.  Lindstrom's Turandot is performed well and respectably, and Eri Nakamura's Liu is pretty damn spectacular, even ignoring the closeups on her rather large overbite during ""Signore, ascolta'.. (when most of your opera comes from DVDs, you learn to overlook the less savory details in favor of the voices - after all, that is the main reason they are there).  Marco Berti gives an acceptable performance as Calaf, but moves himself round the stage like a sack of potatoes - he's no actor, alas.  And the annoying conceit of Ping, Pang and Pong cast with 'evil clown' looks -- complete with silly lip makeup and galloping horseplay and clumsy props (I think I saw Pong cartwheel off-stage once) made me roll my eyes with exasperation.  But what is most interesting about this production was the costume design - the direction and costuming of the chorus to integrate tai chi movements into their slow, stately gestures - that was surprisingly innovative and refreshing without being too precious.  The addition of having the chorus wear haunting, varnished masks also added to the seductive mystery of one of my favorite operas.  It's no Zeffirelli production with the incomparable Domingo (https://www.amazon.com/Puccini-Turandot-at-Metropolitan-Opera/dp/B000094HMU/ref=pd_sim_74_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51930oL7VhL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR113%2C160_&psc=1&refRID=M22DQEZ7DY11TXWM2BB6)  - that one is still, to me, THE production to see on DVD - but it's an interesting addition to your opera library.",1468713600,,1575,5.817391304347826

8644472,5,B00IPDJN8E,"The Royal Operas production of Turandot is a visual wonder! Puccinis famous opera Turandot where Nessun Dorma, one of Operas most famous arias comes from is set in Ancient China. Everything about this revival is grand from the sets, giant mask props and a throne lowering from the sky to the orchestra and dramatic costumes that really give a true oriental finish to the production.

The entire cast gave a great performance. Lise Lindstrom making her Royal Opera debut had a commanding stage presence as the Cruel, Icy Princess Turandot, who makes potential suitors answer a series of riddles, with the punishment for failure being execution. Marco Berti expertly plays Calaf, who against all warnings becomes smitten with Turandot. A special mention goes to Eri Nakamura for her fantastic depiction of Li with terrific acting, vocals and a gentle yet commanding voice.

Viewers who have never seen this production in-house will still be very impressed with the quality in the DVD, there is the option of a selection of subtitles to display including English, French, Italian and Korean.
The filming was very good, with the camera alternating between the entire stage or zooming in on characters at appropriate times of the scene, allowing the viewer to choose where to keep their focus.

Behind the scene extras such as a cast gallery, an introduction by Antonio Pappano to the Opera as well as a short fittingly named Behind the Masks video, giving an insight into the humorous characters of Ping, Pong and Pang as well as the small included booklet outlining the opera are really useful for any newcomers to this opera and viewers wanting more information.
For fans of operas filled with themes of love, honour, loss, death and some wry humour then Turandot is a must see, not only for regular Opera lovers but also for newcomers to Opera.",1410825600,9,1843,4.938709677419355
8644473,5,B00IPDJN8E,This is an extremely powerful performance of Turandot.  All parts were excellently sung and the staging and costumes are magnificent.,1408838400,,133,5.65
8644474,4,B00IPDJN8E,"Turandot was a visual marvel, both in terms of the set and the costumes. As someone who is a very inexperienced opera goer, I found that Turandot had everything I could possibly want from an opera, love, loss, lust and death.

For me, the subtitles were a saviour and really helped me to follow the story and become so wrapped up In the opera. However Turandot- an introduction was equally as useful and a very thoughtful extra feature that included interviews with both the cast and the production team.

It was an extremely powerful performance from all of the cast, I particularly enjoyed Eri Nakamuras portrayal of Lui, who had the most fantastic vocals. However the Lise Lindstrom made for a perfect princess, she was both beautiful and her vocals were outstanding. I thought that Lindstroms portrayal of Turandot was very believable, and she portrayed the fragile yet icy nature of the princess effortlessly.

The orchestra were superb, even from my living room sofa the sound was beautifully clear and incredibly dramatic. The set and costumes were very grand and impressive and really gave a continuous, authentic oriental feel to the whole production. My only critique being that on the DVD the dark background doesn't quite do the set justice.

I would love to see a production of this at the Opera House, I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD but I now want the live experience!",1406332800,5,1380,4.859574468085106
8644475,4,B00IPDJN8E,"The most notable feature of this production is Lise Lindstrom. No question she masters Turandots role in its drama and its music. Because of Lindstrom, it is enough reason to recommend this Blu-Ray.  Marco Berti gives a good performance, but he is not to the par of Lindstrom. A good surprise is Eri Nakamura. She gives a great performance to this very typical Puccini role, the tragic woman.
The staging is always with a dark background, which works very effectively for the intimate scenes, but misses the grandiose ones. In the theater the visual effects are different than in a recording. The dark background doesnt work in this recording for those grandiose scenes with big choruses and many actors on stage.  Even the orchestra seems a little bit mellow when I expect the music to almost explode in a climax with voices and notes from the orchestra. A lot of dance and movement is incorporated into the staging, which I found very effective. It adds to the action and mood of each scene without overwhelming or overshadowing the singers.
Overall and interesting staging and good performance, Recommended.",1406246400,,1110,4.93048128342246
