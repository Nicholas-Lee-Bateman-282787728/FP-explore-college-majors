3960636,5,B002NXSROI,UNBELIEVABLE!!! Jaw dropping and never would i but this movie was good from the way it was set up till the last breath of the person who created the idea. Now that news for you live and in person!!,1360800000,,197,4.076923076923077
3960637,5,B002NXSROI,"This was one of the most exciting movies I have seen. A very creative plot is hatched by a TV producer --6 contestants on a reality show have a chance to win $5 million. They have to play Russian roulette--five will win, one will die . The ending was dramatic, if somewhat obscure (the killer's identity and motivations are never revealed). I highly recommend Live.",1344729600,2,365,4.630769230769231
3960638,3,B002NXSROI,"Was expecting ALOT more gore. But there was really none at all. A very 'odd' movie, no doubt, hence my 3 stars...just trying to stay neutral.

I actually thought Eva's acting was quite good. And in a weird way, not that it would ever happen, if they ever did make a show like LIVE! Folks would certainly tune in. We live in a society where folks are fascinated with death, gore and etc...Imagine if they really did have a live tv show with contestants playing russian roulette. EVERYBODY would watch. Well, not everybody, but most would.

Anyway, an intersting but odd movie, no doubt. I rec others to watch it and form their own opinion.

Somebody already spolied the movie in their review (guess I'll do it also, but assume most have read the previous spoiler review already) by letting us know Eva was killed at the end.

My only issue with this was I figured the killer of Eva was going to be the girlfriend/wife of the guy that was the unlucky loser who blew his head off (with no gore at all......so don't be afraid...cartoons have more gore then this movie did), but instead the killer is just some guy nobody knows and whom we have no clue why he killed eva.

Very odd movie as I said. Just the kind some will love while others hate. I am actually neither tho. Didnt love it...didnt hate it..Glad I watched it but doubtful i'd watch it again.....I guess I just expected more but it was just a pretty dull movie overall, lacking in many ways.",1339027200,,1449,4.432330827067669
3960639,5,B002NXSROI,"GRUESOME BUT INTRIQUING. EXPLODING HEADS AND FACES ARE OK IN MOVIES,BUT NO WORRIES OF EVER SEEING THIS ON TV SINCE THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE BALLS TO AIR EXECUTIONS... BUT PRETEND IS OK.",1314576000,,195,4.764705882352941
3960640,2,B002NXSROI,"This movie was kind of in bad taste.  Yes, we've seen movies where the often thought reality of trying to do anything to increase viewers and TV ratings is the norm.  But, this is purely cold hearted ratings sensationalism that really puts Eva Mendes in a bad light for me.

I love Eva Mendes, but I can't seem to find one of her films that would be worth owning.  She was actually the executive producer of this film, and right from the start, her cold-hearted ambition as a powerful sinister television executive really put me off.  That of her offering a visual self-killing of contestants on television just to benefit herself and television ratings.  This would really reduce the integrity of television itself and really show a disrespect for all moral decency and humanity.

I didn't even feel bad that she was killed in the end.  I don't think people like her (like the role she played) should be allowed to even be in charge of seeking entertainment for television viewers.  Playing God and executioner just for entertainment and self gain.  I wonder what they would have done if the fifth person squeezed off a blank from the gun.  Would the sixth and final contestant still have to pull the trigger knowing that it would be the real bullet, or would they morally say that it was not necessary.  And, would they give him the five million dollars also, or would they say that only five people were to be paid because the sixth player was suppose to die?

Anyway Eva.  I'm still hoping a better film with you in it will come out someday.  This one was psychologically disappointing and not one I'd watch again any time soon.",1284595200,2,1632,4.598615916955017
3960641,4,B002NXSROI,I received the movie in good condition.  The plot is a little odd but it was pretty good.,1274659200,,89,3.9444444444444446
3960642,4,B002NXSROI,"Well-acted and realistically-executed drama, speaking to the often satirical world of sensationalistic TV and ratings-hungry suits. It's very nice to see Eva Mendes in a strong central performance. The underrated Jay Hernandez and veteran Andre Braugher lend fine support in their supporting roles.",1269648000,2,298,5.953488372093023
