7853596,4,6303854362,"""Wild West Days"" is a 13-chapter Universal serial from 1937, starring Johnny Mack Brown, and directed by Ford Beebe and Cliff Smith.  It follows the usual formula with frequent attacks by Indians from Universal's library of stock footage, but the inclusion of three sidekicks for the hero helps keep up the interest.

Rancher Larry Munro (Frank McGlynn, Jr.) has sent for help from former lawman Kentucky Wade (Johnny Mack Brown) who, with his partners Trigger Benton (Robert Kortman), Mike Morales (Frank Yaconelli) and Dude Hanford (George Shelley) find that the town of Brimstone is overrun with outlaws.  Larry Munro's sister, Lucy (Lynn Gilbert) was about to follow her brother into town, worried for his safety while taking ore samples to the assayer, Purvis (Francis McDonald).  And sure enough, Larry is attacked, but kills one of his assailants.  The other, Steve Claggett (Al Bridge) accuses Larry of murder, and even before the first cliffhanger a mob has been instigated to lynch Munro.  At the bottom of all the trouble is Matt Keeler (Russell Simpson), Managing Editor of the Brimstone Gazette, outwardly an opponent of the lawlessness but in fact head of the ""Secret Seven"" who want control of the valley, and are satisfied with the usual activities of cattle-rustling, horse-thieving and gun-running to the Indians, until they find out about Munro's ore samples.

Universal's Western serials are well-known for repetitious plots, but they were intended to be watched one chapter per week.  This one was still suffering from the success of Mascot's ""The Phantom Empire"" and has The Dude's singing, which is not unlike the Indian attacks; the same number is heard in every chapter, ""Song of the Sage"" by Kay Kellogg.  But the singing allows some comic relief, instigated not by Frank Yaconelli, the normal comic relief character, but by Bob Kortman in a rare appearance as a good guy.  There are also some well-known bad-guy actors playing bad guys.  The members of The Secret Seven, in addition to Simpson and McDonald are Walter Miller as Doc Hardy, Charles Stevens as the half-breed Buckskin, and Bruce Mitchell, William Royle and Jack Clifford as Driscoll, Braden and Corey.  Usually aiding Kentucky and his pals are Joseph W. Girard as Judge Lawrence, and Edward LeSaint as the Sheriff.  There's plenty of action, not overburdened by a complicated plot, and our heroes make an effective team.

VCI's edition on VHS, number 1749 is on two tapes.  The source print has a still-frame main title with the letters outlined to make them look less fuzzy, and sharper lettering where ""Serials Incorporated"" replaced the original Universal name in the copyright notice.  The ""Next Week"" titles have been replaced, though with something not too far from the originals except for misspelling ""Theatre"" as ""Theater.""  Fortunately Universal still included the chapter titles with the ""Foreword"" in 1937, and the text scrolls in the conventional manner, without the back-slant, unusual for a Universal serial.  The image quality is about what was expected for VHS releases in the 1990's, not ""restored"" but the gray scale and sharpness are adequate, the framing doesn't cut off any heads, and there is only a mild amount of dirt and small scratches from the print.  The sound has a little distortion, worst in the opening credits of some chapters, but clear enough for the dialogue and singing, without odd artifacts often heard when attempts are made to ""enhance"" the sound.  As with all VHS editions, the duplication quality may vary; the copy I got was an older one made at SP speed.

All of Johnny Mack Brown's serials are good, and this one has plenty of action and a large cast of familiar faces on both sides of the law.  While a clean DVD transfer would be preferable, VCI's old edition on VHS is quite watchable, with a day or so between chapters, and worth a search for a copy at a reasonable price.",1344124800,,3914,4.980030721966206

7853598,3,6303854362,"Let's see, you have a batch of gun fights.  You have some wild horse stampedes.  There are two or three indian attacks on wagon trains.  Don't forget the sneering villian.  And there's Johnny Mack Brown in several hard riding scenes.
This is a 13 chapter cliff hanger, and you'd do well to take 13 days to watch it, a chapter a day.  Hey, it was originally made to see one chapter a week!  The chapter endings are less than spectacular, in fact rather repetitious.  There's at least one case of cheating...I know I saw our hero react from one horse in a stampede running over him, but the next chapter didn't show that.
Well, this isn't one of the best western serials.  For that, you want THE ADVENTURES OF RED RYDER or ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION.  But it is full of action and the type of scenes you watch westerns for, even if there is lots of repetition.  Three stars, but dyed-in-the-wool B western fans might give it more.",1027900800,,925,4.4523809523809526
