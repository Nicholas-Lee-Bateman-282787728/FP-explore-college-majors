4001083,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Whip It is a coming of age film that resonates nostalgia for those who remember watching the Roller Derby on television on any given Saturday depicting that knock em sock em attitude of raunchy women's sports on wheels, that is roller skates.  Although this is not a period film, the sight and sounds of yesteryear lurk in the background and foreground.  From the sounds of the Ramones to the style and dress of mix and match costumes that blares the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially with the characters in the film, roller derby announcer ""Hot Tub"" Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon) and Girl Scout coach Razor (Andrew Wilson).  Drew Barrymore directs and plays Smashley Simpson of the fictitious roller derby team the Girl Scouts in this enticing film that focuses on the ups and downs of adolescent life through the eyes of Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page).

Bliss experiences the demands and growing pains of a 17 year-old who has too much on her plate.  She attends high school and works a part-time job as a waitress at the local Oink Joint BBQ diner by day and plays a 22 year-old fellow roller derby Girl Scout ""Babe Ruthless"" by night, and makes the excuse to her parents that she is taking a prep session for the SAT.  The film follows two premises, the fast paced and high rolling skate ramp scenes and camaraderie between teammates and Bliss's relationship with her overprotective and conservative parents Brooke and Earl Cavendar played by Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern.  With the overbearing expectations at home, Bliss attempts to provide a buffer within her life between the various beauty pageants, such as the Blue Bonnet Pageant, and school and work by participating in her roller derby endeavors.  And to top that off, a budding romance quickly evolves between Bliss and Oliver, the leader of a band called Turbo Fruits, that becomes serious to the extent of the two trading shirts, Bliss's Stryper t-shirt for Oliver's green army jacket, to express their loyalty towards one another; one may say it is one of those ""aw shucks"" type of moments in the film.

Overall, Whip It is a fun and exciting and spells ""pop culture"" throughout the film.  From the music to the humorous screenplay, this movie is worth watching.",1254441600,2,2236,4.814621409921671
4001084,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Based on a the novel Derby Girl by Shauna Cross (who also wrote the screenplay), Whip It is a funny little film about a little known sport called roller derby.  I remember the first time I saw a roller derby match and was stunned at both how physical the sport was and how mesmerizing it could be; it is as exhilerating and thrilling as any other mainstream sport.  Whip It does a good job of capturing the same thrill and feeling of a roller derby match by spinning a mostly cliched coming-of-age story to wrap it together.

Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a rebellious teen living in a too-small-for-her town of Bodeen, Texas.  Her overbearing but very loving mother wants nothing but to have her daughter be a beauty pageant queen like she was in her younger years.  Of course, the blue-haired Bliss wants nothing to do with it.  When, on a trip to Austin, she discovers a pamphlet about a roller derby match, decides to check it out and inadvertently tries out for and is selected to be on a losing roller derby team.  With the help from her teammates, including the awesome Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem (who shares a name with the writer's roller derby name), Bliss learns to ""become her own hero,"" and basically grow up into the person she wants to be.

Mostly, the story in Whip It is the same as any other coming-of-age story, where the young adult ends up learning about theirselves, their family and life in general.  Add into it a love interest and some ""life lessons,"" and you basically have every other growing up story in Hollywood.  The biggest difference here is both the writing which is usually very funny and good and some great performances.  Whip It, Drew Barrymore's first directorial effort, has a great supporting cast (Marcia Gay Harden, Daniel Stern, Juliette Lewis, Zoe Bell and an almost unrecognizable-except-for-his-smile Jimmy Fallon) who really fill out the characters.  It's also nice to see a strong, mostly female cast that has a good message and isn't stereotypically catty.  It's easy to overlook the sometimes cliched plot because Whip It really does a great job in breaking down stereotypes by painting a pretty accurate and heartfelt portrayal of the sport and the strong women who play it.",1254182400,5,2230,4.746113989637306

4001092,5,B002VPTJNQ,"Both my wife and I found this to be an entertaining and fun/funny movie.  Drew Barrymore directs and has a role in this film about 17 yr old Bliss (Ellen Page) who forsakes her mother, Brooke, (Marcia Gay Harden) and her ambition of Bliss becoming a beauty contestant as she was as a member of the Hurl Scout's roller derby team.  After making the cut, Bliss takes on the persona of Babe Ruthless, Number 22.  The number is in reference to the age Bliss gives when trying out for the team.

Whip It! is one of those movies which could and would give young girls a reasonable role model.  The make-up of their team and the competition's members is a slice of life in Austin, TX.  Like ""Rasslin'"", roller derby is about the show.  Put away your reservations and give it a watch.  It's worth it.",1504915200,2,792,4.376712328767123

4001112,3,B002VPTJNQ,"A good movie, but of course, you have to take a few leaps to enjoy it.  For example, you have to suspend belief that all of the 30-something roller derby teammates didn't realize that the incredibly young looking Ellen Page was under 21.  You also have to be willing to accept that someone who can barely roller skate suddenly becomes the star of the roller derby team.  Thats just how movies work I suppose.  So if you can get past those points, and just savor what is a very appealing coming of age story, then you will enjoy this movie.

Also, this movie is almost worth watching for the supporting cast alone  Juliette Lewis, Eve, Drew Barrymore, Kristin Wiig, Jimmy Fallon, Marcia Gay Harden, etc.  all of whom were fantastic!",1486425600,,731,4.576923076923077

At any rate.... Drew Barrymore and the rest of this cast are superb.  It's got everything you want....  Ellen being a dork, Ellen being cool, Ellen being tough and Ellen being vulnerable.

4001131,3,B002VPTJNQ,"More than a bit hokey (sophomoric) acting and plot. Drew Barrymore was a director and had a minor part.
The movie is NOT innocent enough to show to young kids as this 17 year old girl (who looks it) and her new boyfriend take off most clothes during underwater scenes at night in the public swimming pool and leave the rest to ones imagination, duh.
I can not figure out who the intended audience was- perhaps Moms with teen daughters trying to find a way to discuss ""relationships""?
There were some endearing scenes in what is clearly intended to be a ""feel good"" movie.",1474156800,,571,4.5

WITHIN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES YOU GET AN INCREDIBLE URGE TO TURN OFF YOUR BLU RAY PLAYER BECAUSE OF SHEER BOREDOM AND LACK OF ANY EMOTION TO THIS WATCHING PAINT DRY SLOW PACED FILM. CHARACTERS ALL ACT  LETHARGIC. ACTORS SHOW THEIR BOREDOM WITH THE SCRIPT THROUGH THE EXCHANGE OF DIALOG. ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY. BAD CASTING AT EVERY ROLE.

I didn't buy my copy at Amazon but I was counting on the details here and I was really looking forward to it (there are no other Blu-Ray editions). Also, no ""behind the scenes"" and such featurettes (that I knew in advance, but it's still a bummer). Nevertheless, I LOVE this movie and I don't regret having it on Blu-Ray. The picture looks good, and the movie remembers where you paused and lets you add bookmarks. If not for the really disappointing extras, I would have given 5 stars.",1451174400,,621,4.553571428571429

I thought it was one of the best movies I'd seen in ages, perfectly cast, and so very clever. It uses one of the few under-used forums to demonstrate the importance of being ourselves, and developing as a person. It's also funny as hell. Juliette Lewis is such a perfect bitch, and Ellen Page is perfection. The underwater love scene is the most memorable romantic moments I've ever seen in a film.

4001348,5,B002VPTJNQ,"Drew Barrymore's ""Whip It' is both a coming of age movie and a sports movie; a music-filled teen comedy that meets a exploration of an little known activity (roller derby).  Ellen Page is a fine as a high-schooler in a tiny Texas town, with a pageant-crazy mom (Marcia Gay Hayden), a star-in-the-making younger sister (blond of course), and a slightly distant, amiable, sports-loving father (Daniel Stern).  On a trip to Austen, Texas she sees some local rollers, gets a flyer, and -- before you can say ""slammer"" -- digs her old Barbie-adorned skates out of a box.  She tries out for a loser team (the Hurl Scouts), gets a spot, and begins to live.  Every cliche from high school and sports movies shows up, but between Page's solid performance and Barrymore's expertise with the camera it all seems fresh and new and enjoyable.  With Barrymore, Kristen Wiig and Juliette Lewis as other skaters, and Jimmy Fallon as the track announcer.  The blu-ray is of excellent quality -- both in picture and sound.",1397088000,3,1004,4.808139534883721

Other than that, the story, filming etc. was average.",1396569600,,375,4.696969696969697

This movie felt much longer than it needed to. The love interest between Page's character and What's-His-Face felt like a pointless diversion, and this movie would have been just as good - if not better - without that particular bit. The ending took a refreshingly different twist from the standard ""you guessed it"" shtick you see in many of these feel-good movies.

I think it's a fairly unusual and down-to-earth Hollywood portrayal of a teenage girl. There is conflict with her family, but it's more realistic than in most movies, and I think it adds to the film in this instance. One scene that implies and some words that confirm extramarital sex, so not recommended for younger kids. But older teens should really identify and enjoy. The scenes with the roller girls are hilarious and just a visual joy to watch. Also, anyone from Austin will recognize several of the settings, so that's super fun! Catchy, fun, fast-paced, funny, a little rough-around-the-edges, but sweet at heart. A little like a roller girl??",1393632000,,770,4.840909090909091

I thought this movie was wonderful, lots of funny moments, actors embracing the caricatures of themselves that Drew Barrimore created (for Jimmy Fallon, Zoe Bell, and herself especially). It works as a great coming of age story about a high schooler (Ellen Page) finding something to be passionate about, discover confidence, fall in love, and eventually confront her overbearing mother and complacent father. Some of the side characters would have benefited from being fleshed out, especially the motivations of the rest of the Hurl Scouts, but otherwise excellent.",1392940800,,717,5.076271186440678

Only feminist-soap-box complaint is that all the roller derby team coaches were male...but I can deal thanks to part (d) above.  Conclusion: go watch it!",1392768000,2,419,4.573333333333333

However, I don't think it accurately portrayed roller derby, and there was very little time given to the sport at all. It basically shows a rebellious teen pick up roller derby in one day and all of a sudden become the team's jammer who takes them to the finals weeks after she can't skate without falling down. Sure, they have limited time, but I was expecting something different. Maybe this movie failed to impress me because of my high expectations, but my mom at least appreciated the effort of me coming over to watch it and is a wee bit more supportive of my decision.",1392336000,,740,4.330935251798561

4001382,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Released in 2009, ""Whip It"" was Drew Barrymore's first and (so far) only full-length film in the director's chair. Drew also co-stars, but she's a side character and non-essential to the plot.

The story revolves around 17 year-old Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), her parents (Daniel Stern & Marcia Gay Harden) and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat). Bliss is involved in the world of beauty pageants due to her mother's obsession, but becomes fascinated by a group of roller derby girls while visiting nearby Austin, TX. She decides to try-out for the the Hurl Scouts.

""Whip It"" starts out slow and only mildly interesting but it ultimately won me over. This is basically a coming-of-age drama using the roller derby as a backdrop and stage. Since Ellen Page takes center focus, and does a great job, ""Whip It"" should appeal to fans of Page. I'm not a fan; I can take her or leave her. Thankfully, there's enough good here to draw in other folks.

I especially like the roller derby girls and their camaraderie & competition. The girls include Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig, Eve, Zoe Bell, Ari Graynor, Eli Bleiler and Sydney Bennett. What I love about these women is that they have womanly curves and aren't walking sticks with big breasts. Take, for instance, the so-called Manson Sisters, played by Kristen Adolfi & Rachel Piplica; both are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous throughout the film and worth the price of admission -- stunning examples of womanhood.

There's a subplot about Bliss falling for a guy in a rock band (Landon Pigg) and there are other characters, like the coach, the derby announcer and the Hispanic manager of the restaurant Bliss & Pash work at (Andrew Wilson, Jimmy Fallon and Carlo Alban respectively), but this is mainly about Bliss, her family, Pash and the derby girls.

FINAL SAY: The drama in this coming-of-age flick is a mixed bag; I found the love story kind of tedious but enjoyed Pash and the family dynamics of the Cavendar household. The best part, of course, is the derby action and the ravishing derby babes in all their glory.

The film runs 111 minutes and was mostly filmed in Michigan with some shots of Austin, TX.

4001413,3,B002VPTJNQ,"I was disappointed in this film. Ellen Page plays Bliss Cavendar, a small-town teenager living in Texas. She is an outcast, working in a small diner and being influenced by her mother, (Marcia Gay Harden) to be in beauty pagents. One day while shopping Bliss sees a group of roller derby gals come skating into the store. She is intrigued and persuades her best friend Pash, (Alia Stewart) to go with her and see what ""roller-derbying"" is all about. As soon as she sees a real roller derby match she is hooked. She soon, unbelievably soon, becomes a member of an eccentric team of misfits and is dubbed ""Babe Ruthless"". The cast selection was great. I looked forward to seeing Ellen Page, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, and others but unfortunetly it was a waste of talent. Ellen Page's character was much too similar to her role in Juno. It seemed at first that she was working to avoid being typecast as Juno but then as the movie progressed she rapidly morphed into her old Juno character. This film could have been funnier if there had been a great script and I am sorry to say I was unimpressed by Ms. Barrymore's role as director. The film was really choppy and unformed. There were so many possibilities for this to be really campy but she and the screenwriters really came up short. It wasn't funny, it wasn't poignant, it wasn't original, it was just boring and I had seen it all before. It is a shame because I looked forward to being entertained and by the end I was almost alseep. I will give HATS OFF to two superb performances; Juliette Lewis as ""Iron Maiden"", the hardened superstar of the opposing team, and Kristen Wiig as ""Maggie Mayhem"", the sweet fellow teammate who acts as mother and guide to Bliss. They both were perfect in their roles. I will also mention a wonderful soundtrack that is original, creative and, as Drew tells us, is ""her present to her audience"".

So I was pleased when a friend suggested I try Amazon and I found that they had it.  A little schmaltzy, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1335744000,2,432,3.875
4001434,4,B002VPTJNQ,"It's official: Until further notice, I will happily see any movie featuring Ellen Page. As in previous movies, Page does an outstanding job in bringing her angsty teenage character to life. This time, she's a slightly lost seventeen year old being herded around by a pageant-passionate mother. The first glimmering that she might have goals of her own comes when she sees roller derby girls dropping off flyers for an upcoming event. Of course, she sneaks out to see it using a pretext transparent to everyone but her parents, and she is transfixed. After the show, she tells one of the skaters, ""You guys are my heroes!"" The tattooed derby girl answers, ""Come to the tryout - be your own hero."" And she does.

The rest follows an inspiring and hilarious season of sneaking around the parents, doing her part to bring the last-place team to the championship. As you might expect, the poo hits the fan when pageant-panicked Mom finds out that her little beauty queen has another life as Babe Ruthless. I found the parent/teen flareups somewhat milder than realistic, but then the rapprochement was unconvincingly minor, too.

But, if that tension had been much tenser, a lot of the movie's core fun would have been hidden. Barrymore, in her debut role as director, clearly had fun making this and the fun comes through in the final product. The girl-power, be-who-you-are messages come through without shrillness, and Page's navigation of teen heartbreak leaves her character convincingly in the lead. One scene near the very end, her father with hammer in hand (wait for it) was a bit predictable, but satisfying none the less. As was the whole movie. I don't always want a movie that takes itself too seriously. When you want a fun bit of fluff with plenty of physical comedy, give this one a shot. It's well worth the time spent seeing it.

4001444,3,B002VPTJNQ,"It's not a bad movie but it's not great either. The acting is very good and Ellen Page is a star. I thought the beginning of the movie where the two high school girls discover roller derby and where Ellen hangs out and meets her future boyfriend at that house party rang so true in a ""wonder of it all discovering life outside the boredom of Small Town America"" type of way.

I got tired of the constant explaining of the ""rules"" of roller derby and the Jimmy Fallon (seriously, Jimmy Fallon?) arena-side announcing was just unnecessary.

The story follows the typical Hollywood script--girl meets roller derby, roller derby meets girl, girl meets boy, boy goes on tour with band, parents get angry she is secretly roller derby-ing, crying and anger ensue and in the end all is forgiven and everyone sees the light (bar the stereotypical sensitive alterna rock boyfriend).

Anyway, for what it is it's just OK. It could have been far better and in a way Kansas City Bomber with Raquel Welch is far superior (and I am being both literal and sarcastic on that note).

Extras? What extras? Just ads for the soundtrack and other movie trailers.
Get the soundtrack CD or download as any soundtrack with a Raveonettes tune in it gets the thumbs up from me.",1314144000,,1250,4.617117117117117

The basic problem is that ""Whip It"" is filled with cliches and even some stupidity (the scene in the pool? Give me a break). It still works well enough, thanks to a great cast and a fun atmosphere, but the lack of originality brings it down a notch.

4001447,4,B002VPTJNQ,"This is a very impressive debut film for a director, and of course it's even more interesting because that director is Drew Barrymore (who also has a small supporting role in the film).  The plot of the movie is very typical: girl's life is planned by parent/parents; girl rebels and finds own path; conflict with parent ensues; compromise occurs and then happy ending for everyone.  The execution of this plot, however, and its handling of character development, is what really makes the movie enjoyable.  In fact, I would say that in a few years it will probably be considered a cult classic.

Ellen Page is a very capable young actress.  And although she is in danger of being typecast for her snarky attitude, her character in Whip It is not nearly as sardonic and cynical as it was in Juno, which is a pleasant change.

The rest of the characters are well-cast, too, but her rollerball team is largely comprised of charicature performances, since the movie isn't really long enough to let each girl have her own fully fleshed out character and story.

The first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but once it gets going it's a fun ride.  The roller derby scenes are exciting and hilarious, and it's one of the only ""sports"" movies where I actually care about the character who is trying to win.

This is a rare movie that succeeds as a comedy, as a drama, and as a sports movie. I think mostly anyone younger than forty would appreciate its humour and message, and perhaps people from older generations would, as well.",1311033600,3,1540,4.611721611721611

However, this movie was really good. Ellen Page is phenomenal, as usual, this time as Bliss, a seventeen year old diner waitress whose overbearing mother Brooke (played by Marcia Gay Harden) is pressuring her to compete in beauty pageants, which Bliss has no interest in.

Alia Shawkat plays Bliss's best friend Pash, Carlo Alban plays her friend and co-worker, and Landon Pigg briefly plays a love interest. The only weak character is Bliss's father, played by Daniel Stern.

One day, Bliss sees a bunch of roller dirby girls, part of the Hurl Scouts team, in a shop and is intrigued. She attends their exposition show and is asked to try out. She makes the team and quickly proves herself, but is forced to hide this new life from her parents since she knows they won't approve.

Drew Barrymore as Smashley Simpson, Juliette Lewis as Iron Maven from the opposing team, and Andrew Wilson as the coach Razor are all very good. Jimmy Fallon is quite humorous in his role as the roller derby MC.

The only thing keeping it from five stars is the fact that sometimes the need to suspend disbelief is a bit too strong--if I were to review it as a fairy tale, it definitely would be five stars.

I kept expecting things to fall into stereotypical situations and characters, but this film never stoops to that level.  The characters are likable and believable, and the story itself is fun.  I love how the women of the roller derby are treated with dignity and respect--there's no condescending attitude, which is always a danger with this kind of story.  I also appreciate the fact that the resolution of the main character's family issues is an important part of the plot, and that they didn't let her get away with being so selfish--yes, she had every right to do what she did, but she has to face her own selfishness if she's to grow as a character.  And there's growth in all of the main characters, which makes a good film even better.

Bliss is a seventeen year old girl who lives in a quiet Texan town, she works at a local diner, she likes rock music and her mum encourages her to enter beauty pageants. Then everything gets turned upside down when she finds and joins a roller derby team and a love interest in the guise of a guitarist in a local band. Before long she is breaking out of her shell, as well as breaking some heads as she whips her way round the derby ring. She finds an alternative, outlandish family in her team mates and has to balance her mums aspirations for her and her own dreams in life.

Ellen Page is excellent as Bliss and all of her team mates are superb as alternative, fun loving girls with heart. Barrymore is hilarious in the side role she plays, as is the feisty Juliette Lewis and all of the `stage names' the girls take on will crack you up. The crashes and bashes on the track will make you laugh and wince in equal measures.

Drew is a lot more than a pretty face---it seems she's also a great judge of screenplays and a great director. The casting is absolutely perfect. Every line, every expression, every scene is pitch perfect. The acting is wow! If you can watch this without laughing yourself sore and tearing up (in a manly way, of course) then you're obviously suffering from the same degenerative brain disease as the reviewers who rate it below 4 stars. And what's amazing is there is nothing really gross or offensive in it. A few off color lines is all that gives it the 13+ rating.

It was a tried and true 'Footloose' concept, of youth rebelling against family/community mores, who after the trauma and punishment of being found out opens minds and becomes supported by the family/community.  Seeing that play out in a more feminine atmosphere was interesting.  I felt like there was a little too much Page (particularly since she always plays the same geek teen character) though not enough Barrymore in front of the camera.  Likewise, Lewis was a notch over the top.  She seemed like she was acting for her life, and came off melodramatic.

At 22, she still looks the 17-year old teenager this role calls for whose mother wants her to compete in beauty pageants but who sneaks away to the nearby town of Austin in order to compete in a roller derby.  I loved the concept, the acting and the spirit of the roller derby itself, where young women compete in this rough tough sport that bruises their bodies but inspires them to just keep going.

Naturally there are complications, especially when Ellen's parents discover her actions and also when her seemingly devoted boyfriend goes on the road with his band.  Through it all, the theme is clear.  ""Do what you love to do and sooner or later the world will support you.""

Even though I loved this film, it was a bit silly.  How could this young girl keep her secret from her parents for so long a time?  And the film seemed rather dated because of its lack of cell phones.  There's even a scene where young Ellen makes a phone call to her boyfriend from a coin-operated phone on the street.  Also, there was no doubt of the outcome.  At the end, everyone lived happily ever after.

She has a fresh, intelligent, unpretentious appeal, and it makes sense that she would be attracted to the role of Bliss, a 17 year old girl trying to break out of the small town mold she feels trapped in, secretly opting for the roughhouse world of roller derby competitions, while her mother continues grooming her for a far more conventional future (word has it that Page backed out of being in Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell in order to star here).  Page has a good supporting cast backing her up, chief among them the also quite-charming Alia Shawkat as her best buddy, Pash; with Daniel Stern and Marcia Gay Harden both warm and sympathetic as her struggling-to-be-understanding parents.  Both parental figures came across as believable, flesh and blood people, which Hollywood often has a hard time accomplishing in youth-oriented comedies, sad to say.  The movie itself is definitely a bit on the predictable and moralistic side, but shows respect to all its characters, never descending into caricatures for easy, smug laughs, and sporting that very strong Girl Power vibe: so nice to see it come out in FAVOR of tough roller derby girls in the end, no apologies.",1281657600,3,1242,4.84433962264151

Fledgling filmmaker Drew Barrymore makes your confusion irrelevant because ""Whip It"" is so imbued with high-spiritedness and fun.  One could nitpick and say there are moments in the film that are cutesy and self-consciously cool.  That can be dismissed as rookie errors but on the whole Barrymore displays enough assuredness behind the lens that I look forward to her future efforts.  Ellen Page's star continues to rise here as the reluctant smalltown beauty queen turned enthusiastic derby star.  In her young career Page has made some terrific choices eschewing more commercial vehicles and going for offbeat parts that fit her personality to a tee.

4001473,4,B002VPTJNQ,"I've got to agree with a lot of stuff this Roger Long guy wrote who reviewed the movie right before me.  The romance really is tossed in for no reason, seeing as how it's quite unresolved at the end.  Maybe the resolution was edited out for time reasons.

On the other hand, I think the struggle between ambitions of children and the plans of their parents is depicted surprisingly well.  Not something I expected in a movie that's based on a sport that reminds me of pro-wrestling.  I keep waiting for the day when a roller derby girl will get disqualified for hitting a fellow competitor with a chair.

The coach in this movie is hilarious.  Even though Jimmy Fallon's forced laughs aren't bad, I have to say he's upstaged by the coach here.  Of course, Whip It is really more of a drama than a comedy.  Watch it if you want to see something about parental conflict.",1274313600,2,868,4.443037974683544
4001474,3,B002VPTJNQ,"Last week I rented Whip It because I love Ellen Page and think that she is hilarious. Though I was a bit disappointed, I thought that the movie was not without a certain amount of charm. The plot is simple, Ellen Page (Sarah Habel) is caught between her dreams and those of her mother (played by Marcia Gay Harden). While her mother enrolls Sarah in various beauty pageants, Sarah is drawn to roller derbies and its subculture. Though she does not want to disappoint her mother, she knows that she must follow her dreams.

The plot appears extremely simple and cliched but Barrymore and Page are able to make a jaded storyline more appealing than other films in the genre. Perhaps the reason for this is because Sarah's dream does not include increasing her popularity and dating the hunky guy at school. Instead it involves a sport and culture that is often considered part of the underbelly of the sports scene (that's when it's even acknowledged at all!). Things seem to get a bit hackneyed when Sarah falls for a band member in a local grunge band. However, that storyline is fleeting and the focus is placed once more on Sarah's conflicting feelings and subsequent personal growth. The movie could have been more interesting if there was a greater focus on roller derbies and less on Sarah's own inner turmoil. Yet, the movie was not intended to be solely about roller derbies and therefore the balance between the two was handled nicely. Overall, it's a story about girl power in the least irritating and most convincing way. As Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, this film shows that she has great potential as a director in this genre. Though I would never have spent the movie admission of $10, it is a good movie to watch curled up on your couch.",1274313600,,1757,4.686084142394822
4001475,3,B002VPTJNQ,"I like Ellen Page as an actress, so I very much looked forward to this movie.  Unfortunately it was just a wee bit overdone.

The plot is just too contrived--predicated on a skinny Texas schoolgirl being able to sneak past her parents' radar and being able to become the star in the tough sport of roller derby with mature and rough women.  That's the first problem.  Then, there is a romance with a rocker that was just tossed in and that I never bought for a second.  Then there are the throw-in scenes for the heck of it, i.e., a food fight and a almost nude romp in the swimming pool.  These gadget scenes did not advance the story at all.  Finally, there is the ""championship,"" the obligatory scene in any sports movie, it would seem.  We've seen it all before and it's a yawner.

Still. I give this three stars for Ellen Page who is an excellent actress, one I hope will be cast in the American movie version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo""  It should tax her acting ability to the maximum, but I think she can do it.  ""Whip It"" was just not worth her talent.",1274227200,2,1069,4.268656716417911

I understand its partially supposed to portray the teams that restarted derby  in the early 2000s at the  thunderdome.  What i was peeved most about though is that the main character ditches her bestfriend and leaves here there with a beer to get arrested by the cops  while she goes and gets laid and is underage wtf ( by a guy who treats her as a groupy no less and sleeps with other chicks).

Drew Barrymore has been a favorite since ET and Fire starter. Now she is on the other side of the camera also I will be waiting for more. She was great in her loony burn out role in Whip It.

There are some real issues being addressed here, mostly between the mother and daughter with the pretty quiet dad being heard as well.  I think Barrymore's attacks were completely unnecessary as well as several other fights that I think just marred and took away from the movie.

Those things are the only things that keep me from giving it 5 stars.  Otherwise I think it is a movie that can be used to open up dialogue between parents and children with issues that definitely are a part of life.",1271808000,,578,4.4245283018867925

Drew Barrymore has done quite a few funny movies, so I expected alot of laughs. There's a few in there I suppose, but not enough. What a great cast they had put together for this movie! Its too bad you never get to see any of them! I wanted to see way more of the team interacting, we barely say them at all except when they were skating. There are some bad a** ladies in this movie and they were all wasted.
I lost interest towards the end and couldn't wait for it to be over with, because we all know the ending.....Mom and Daughter come to understanding, blah blah blah. snoozefest.

4001486,4,B002VPTJNQ,"""Whip It"" is Drew Barrymore's first stab at directing and she does well.  The movie has added charm and oomph to the ""Follow Your Dream"" theme.

Ellen Page plays a 17 year old Bliss Cavendar, a small town Texas teenager with a big dream.  She wants to drive her own life, but her mother has beauty pageants and a stereotyped 1950's life planned for her.  She comes from a stable home life with a working mother and dad, plus a younger sister who has won some beauty contests herself.  Bliss has part-time job at the ""Oink Joint"" and a good friend that supports her.  One day, as she goes shopping with her mother and sister for a pair of shoes, Bliss discovers a way to put energy or ""wheels"" to her predictable life.  She lands a spot on a rough-and-tumble roller derby team and becomes ""Babe Ruthless""  the hottest thing on eight wheels.

The movie has energy and great charm as we watch Bliss navigate her own path to happiness, trying not to hurt the people she loves.",1271635200,3,972,4.415730337078652
4001487,5,B002VPTJNQ,"Loved the movie even more than the book, Derby Girl, upon which the movie was based.  Ellen Page softened the character of Bliss and I can't imagine anyone else doing a better job.  The supporting cast was wonderful.  The movie expanded the storyline perfectly while maintaining much of the dialogue straight from the book and best of all expanded the derby action.  Kudos to Drew Barrymore in her directing debut and in her supporting role.  D.B. obviously gravitates towards the girl power genre while having the knack of toning it down just enough to be enjoyable to general audiences.  I truly hope the author or a screen writer comes up with a clever sequel because this was a ride that ended way too soon.",1271203200,4,711,4.693548387096774

The lead character, played by Ellen Page, is still living under her mother who wants her to become a trophy girl and is still forced to enter one beauty pageant after another.  The movie really is about this character spreading her wings and learning life lessons.  There are so many great performances in ""Whip It"" that it would take far too long to list them all but the main characters down to the trivial ones are all played wonderfully.",1271030400,3,569,4.4

4001492,4,B002VPTJNQ,"""Whip It"" was directed by Drew Barrymore and the screenplay and novel were both written by Shauna Cross. It stars Ellen Page as Bliss Cavendar, a young girl struggling to get out of her small town life constantly trying to please her mother by entering beauty pageants she doesn't like until she discovers a roller derby league in Austin, TX.

This was a very fun story to tell. Ellen Page fits right in as the misfit who has clever things to say and is brave enough to secretly rebel against her mom. I think her performance in Juno was much stronger but I still enjoyed her journey. Bliss's mother, Brooke is played by Marcia Gay Harden who floored me with how scary she could be in ""The Mist"" and played just the right amount of hardness with occasional softness towards her daughter. She played a pageant mom hook, line, and sinker. Absolutely perfect casting.

Bliss's best friend, Pash is played by Alia Shawkat whom you'd remember as Maybe from Arrested Development. What I love about this actress - she's quick, she knows her comedy, and she's a real girl looking at her. Her freckles are adorable and their relationship made me wish I had a best friend growing up I could depend on like that.

The roller derby girls are played by Kristen Wiig, Zoe Bell, Eve, Drew Barrymore, and a very fun performance by Juliette Lewis as Iron Maven, Bliss's rival from another team. She managed to be VERY intimidating for such a small girl. If I could change something, I would stop her from wearing those low-cut v-neck shirts because her pecs make her look a little manish and that was weird. Her acting was fun to watch as she sized up the new peanut and tried not to show how much it bothered her. The girls on Bliss's team all did well with the physicality and all were distinctly different from each other. Sometimes I felt Drew Barrymore's character was a little too stupid, but it's her movie I guess.

There's a subplot of a romantic relationship with a boy named Oliver played by Landon Pigg as part of her process of coming out of her shell and giving her extra stress in her relationship with her mother, but it felt pretty unnecessary. It would have been a better girl power movie without it. And I'm getting tired of the cliche of two young people being brought together over a love of vinyl records which automatically makes them deep.

Not a bad first time around directing for Drew. At first I had a hard time seeing what was going on at the derby in the first few action shots but it got better over time. I also appreciated the rules segment to explain to the audience how this game was played.

My biggest complaint and the worst casting was Jimmy Fallon. He was terrible. Not funny, really scrubby, I just wanted him off the screen. I'm very disappointed in him. And to think I used to have a crush on him when he was on SNL. I don't think he's as talented as people thought then.

All in all, a very fun movie. I loved the intensity of the roller derby, Marcia Gay Harden's acting was the best of the film, loved seeing Maybe, and Daniel Stern (Marv from ""Home Alone"") was a wonderful surprise as Bliss's father. For exercise in the summer, all I do is roller skate so this movie really made me want to break my skates out of their winter hibernation....",1269129600,2,3272,4.461538461538462

Ellen Page's acting is incredible, and in this story you can easily fall in love with the undertoned storyline and the effects that storyline has on Ellen page's character than the actual rollerblade story line.

It really shouldn't come as a surprise that the world of roller derby gets their own entry as well.

The movie follows Bliss, a young girl who constantly lives in the shadow of everyone around her. Whether its her overbearing, yet well meaning mother or her mocking classmates, Bliss usually puts up with everything. It is only when she discovers the world of roller derby that she begins to gain the self confidence that she so desperately needs.

This was a cute film. It just wasn't a great film. While the plot has just about everything it needs to appeal to a general audience, I can't help but feel like there was something missing from the film. Part of me couldn't really understand how Bliss caught on to everything & became such a great derby player almost overnight, which was the only real problem I had with the film. I loved seeing how Bliss dealt with the issues surrounding her, especially towards the end. The acting is pretty good & I liked seeing that Bliss has some true love for her family- even when they don't see eye to eye. And I loved the guy who played Razor- he was just awesome as the coach.

I just felt like this film needed a little bit more ""oomph"" to it in the non-derby scenes. When the derby scenes are on, the film really does come alive & it sparkles with energy. Unfortunately the non-derby scenes just needed a little extra something.

But for what's Barrymore's first film, it's pretty darn good. It shows that she has promise as a director & I can expect her future films to just get better. Plus the soundtrack was just awesome. It just fell a little short of what I'd expected from the film.

While her mother would prefer that Bliss unlace her skates and step back before the judges, the rebellious teen instead seeks the wisdom of rowdy mentor Malice in Wonderland in learning the tricks of the circuit track. The movie is much better than plot may sound. Ellen Page is superb as usual, taking on a somewhat different role than what I've seen before. It's impossible to compare her to her role in Juno, as in ""Whip It"" she plays a much more introverted, but still conflicted girl. Andrew Wilson was probably the funniest character in the movie. Drew Barrymore had a very small role in the movie. The rest of the cast was solid, including Marcia Gay Harden as the strict but loving mother.

4001499,3,B002VPTJNQ,"Ellen Page was not the appropriate actress to play the main character, Bliss. (Page does not seem the best choice to play either a beauty pageant contender or a roller derby queen, let alone both.) But the rest of the movie is so well cast that Page's dry wit would have allowed one to overlook the square-peg-in-a-round-hole problem with this casting.

But the main problem with this movie is that the screenplay just meanders, causing the energy to flag.  And in a movie about a roller derby queen the worst sin is allowing the energy to flag.  A good editor could have easily pushed this movie up into four star territory.  Unfortunately, Barrymore's directorial debut suggests that she should stay in front of the camera.  This movie gets a third star simply on the basis of a strong supporting cast.  (Daniel Stern as a redneck?  But he pulls it off!)",1268438400,,856,4.666666666666667

It features Ellen Page as a waitress in a small town who is basically bored and in need of something, she is just not sure what.  Then she hears about a Roller Derby event in a nearby town and decides to check it out.  After watching the Roller Derby skaters, she falls in love with the sport and with some motivation she tries out and makes it.  Now of course she does lie about her age and to her parents about what she is actually doing when skating, but the movie emphasizes to live in the moment and try out new things.  Ellen's character also shows off how you have to practice and how great it is to be part of a team.

I really like this movie and think it would be cute for any ages.  It is not just a teen movie, although it does include teen romance, but it also has some great actors and actresses like Jimmy Fallon and Juliette Lewis.  I couldn't get my husband to watch this movie with me, because he thought it was all about girl power, but I do think he would have liked it because of the humor and action.

and had fairly high hopes for it.i don't quite think it lived up to my

outweighed the negatives.i'll start with with what i didn't like.the
first thing was i thought the movie was too slow at times.and it takes
too long too get going.and the whole 'someone lives in small town and
hates it and want to get out scenario' is all too familiar.i realize
this is necessary to get to know the characters,but for me the least
amount of time spent on that familiar scenario without compromising the
integrity of the character development-the better in my opinion.once we
get to the meat of the story,the whole roller derby aspect,that's when
the movie picks up. Ellen Page is good,as is most of the rest of the
cast.the only two people i didn't care for were Drew Barrymore and
Juliette Lewis.i just didn't buy them in there respective roles.i just
think they're both a bit old to be portraying those types of characters

It is set in Bodeen and Austin, Texas. Along with Bliss there is her mother (Marcia Gay Harden), who is very conservative and beauty pageant  obsessed; her father (Daniel Stern) who is supportive of his girls, but still wishes he had a boy to play football; and Pash (Alia Shawkat) who is Bliss' only friend.

Bliss' life mostly consists of working at the local Oink Joint restaurant with Pash, going to school, and the beauty pageants her mother forces her to do. That all changes when on a shopping trip to Austin with her mom when she finds a flyer for a roller derby bout. She and Pash decided to check it out and afterward Bliss wants more. She ends up talking to one of the girls on the Hurl Scouts team and she tells Bliss about try outs, however you need to be 21 and Bliss is only 17. She lies about her age and decides to try out, unbeknownst to her parents, at the next recruitment session and makes it onto the Hurl Scouts team. The Hurl Scouts are the worst team in the league and made up of Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), Smashley Simpson (Drew Barrymore), Bloody Holly (Zoe Bell), Rosa Sparks (Eve), and the Manson sisters (Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica).

I had high hopes for this film having watched and totally enjoyed Juno, I thought Ellen Page would be the new Thora Birch/Christina Ricci/Janeane Garfolo.

Page certainly tries to do her best with this film, has a few good scenes and makes me laugh but unfortunately the script, direction and her co-stars let her down so badly not even her quick quips can save it.

Im not adverse to a good sport film- don't get me wrong; roller derbys are certainly interesting and I enjoyed learning more about them (hey i even wanted to dig out my old skates after I watched this) but Im overwhelmingly disappointed with what good have been a great film that failed to deliver.

How degraded has our society become that some people would spend millions of dollars making it, and others would spend millions of dollars to go see it?  Has our civilization sunk so low as this?

A frumpy little teenager from a dysfunctional suburban family is a failure at everything, never able to make a real human connection with anyone.  Disliked and rejected by her parents, she lies and cheats to join the degenerate roller derby world, which is populated by freaks doing mean things to each other, excels physically there after a disastrous start, and with that she wins the respect and appreciation of her shallow, self-absorbed parents who have their own distorted agenda and seek personal validation through what they try to manipulate their children to be.

The message this film seems to attempt is that normal American society is evil; malicious degenerate freaks are good.

My husband and I watched this with our 12  year old daughter, and we all liked this movie very much.  With little gore and mild sex that is more referred to than shown, WHIP IT is definitely refreshing and fun.

WHIP IT is the story of Bliss, a seventeen-year-old diner waitress in a backwater town near Austin, Texas. Bliss is basically a good girl, doing everything her overbearing mother asks, including competing in (and often winning) beauty pageants.  But Bliss really wants to make more of her life, and to find her own path.  When she finds a flyer advertising a Roller Derby match in Austin, she and her best friend sneak out to the big city and have an adventure.  Something about the Roller Derby and the women who compete strike a chord in Bliss, and one of the teams invites her to try out.  Before she quite knows what is happening, Bliss makes the team and becomes a Hurl Scout.  Bliss then has many life decisions to make, each of which has significant consequences.  Can Bliss find the path that will make her truly happy?

Ellen Page is delightful and dead on as Bliss.  I really like the heart and soul that Ellen puts into her characters.  The rest of the cast is excellent and equally talented (including director Drew Barrymore, Marcia Gay Harden, and Kristen Wiig), but Ellen Page truly carries this film.  WHIP IT is well paced, slow and thoughtful where appropriate, yet full of excitement and great action at the Roller Derby.  And I always like the messages from Ms. Barrymore's films...girls can do anything.  Something I definitely want to instill in my 12  year old.

4001519,3,B002VPTJNQ,"Roller Derby.  I can easily remember turning on the television and watching the Los Angeles T-Birds. Personally, I didn't know if this was a true sport or if it was like wrestling and it was just sports entertainment.  But I was hooked.  Not sure if it was the blonde women with poofy hair throwing other women out of the rink or that one person who didn't look should be on the rink, actually kicking butt.  Needless to say, that roller derby has had its following for decades and now here we are with a film based on a character who takes part in roller derby competitions.

""Whip It"" marks the directorial debut by actress Drew Barrymore (""E.T."", ""50 First Dates"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Charlie's Angels"" films) and is an adaptation of the novel ""Derby Girl"" by Shauna Cross, a fictionalized book of skating with the TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls.

The independent film was released in theaters during the fall of 2009 and now makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut.  The Blu-ray edition comes with a second disc which contains a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Whip It"" is presented in 1080 High Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1), AVC @ 36 MBPS.  The film sports vibrant colors with the Hurl Scouts green outfits, while amber lights shine on the roller derby rink.  You can see details in the surroundings, especially injuries ala bloody noses to bruises.  Even the tattoos on Kristen Wiig are seen much clearly on HD.  Skin tones are natural and blacks are nice and deep.  Everything is visible from the freckles of Pash, to the sweat and tears of Bliss and the other girls during competition or the more emotional scenes of the film.  I will say that at first, I thought this was a period film shot in the '80s but you realize that the film focuses on Bliss living in a very small town.

There is a fine amount of grain in the film and I didn't notice any compression artifacts, banding or any sign of DNR.  A solid Blu-ray release in terms of PQ from Fox.

As for the audio, ""Whip It"" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish, French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue and music are both crystal clear but there is minimal use of surrounds.  You can hear crowd ambiance and the women racing on the rink and hitting the side rails and hearing the skates but its not immersive as I would have hoped but still, the film is not all about the roller derby and there are plenty of dialogue scenes and music-driven scenes that are very clear, with some songs having a nice kick of bass.  A pretty interesting soundtrack as well from '80s 38 Special's ""Caught Up in You"" to music from the Ramones and the Breeders.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Whip It"" comes with a digital copy of the film and comes with a few special features:

  * Deleted Scenes - (16:14) Included is an alternate opening and eight deleted scenes.
  * Fox Movie Channel Presents Writer's Draft: Shauna Cross of ""Whip It"" - (3:04) A short featurette with an interview with novel and screenwriter Shauna Cross about ""Whip It"".
  * Whip It Soundtrack Spot - (:32) A promotional for the ""Whip It"" soundtrack.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Whip It"" may seem like a film about roller derby and the antics that go behind-the-scenes of the sport but truthfully, the film has many layers.  From a coming-of-age film, a relationship movie and a girl power film, there are a good number of things going on in this film that there is far much more to enjoy than expected.

I have to admit that Drew Barrymore's directorial debut definitely shows promise.  The actress has starred in so many films since she was a child and has worked with a good number of quality director's, I had no doubt that she would do a pretty solid job.

Part of the challenge of ""Whip It"" is bringing together this wild bunch of characters that the character Bliss associates with and then bringing this other side of her life as a teenager from a small town, having an overbearing pageant mother and working at a fast food restaurant while trying to maintain her friendship with her high school friends and then finding love.  Definitely not an easy task for Barrymore but one thing she does have is the original author Shauna Cross involved with the screenplay and she has a talented actress in Ellen Page in the main role.

At first glance, I didn't know if Page can pull of such a role but as she did with ""Juno"" she manages to pull of Bliss very well for ""Whip It"".

As for the other supporting characters, personally I don't if roller derby lifestyles are similar to what is depicted in the movie.  As much as I do enjoy Barrymore's directorial debut, her role as Smashley Simpson is a bit too much while I do feel Kristen Wiig manages to pull off another solid supporting role like she has done in ""Extract"" and Juliette Lewis still does a great job in portraying the bad girl.  Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern (who plays Bliss's father) also do a good job as the parents of Bliss.

As for the Blu-ray, the picture quality for the film was very good and the lossless audio was satisfactory but it would have been great to have it a bit more immersive via use of the surround channels.  And it would have been great to have audio commentary by Barrymore and Shauna Cross or even a featurette on how the talent prepared for the film or even  Behind-the-scenes footage.  I felt the special features were a bit short for this Blu-ray release.  But as for the film, ""Whip It"" is an entertaining, humorous and a solid coming-of-age, feel-good style of film.  And again, although roller derby does play a big part in this film, ""Whip It"" is not an all out sports movie.  The film has many layers to it and fortunately, the solid performances definitely made this film enjoyable.

Overall, ""Whip It"" is a solid directorial debut from Drew Barrymore and fine performances by Ellen Page and its supporting cast makes this film better than expected.",1265328000,22,5952,4.55743879472693
4001520,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Teen drama and quirk lovers, this one's for you.

Bliss (Ellen Page) lives in dead-end Texas working at the local, home-of-the-Squealer BBQ joint. Her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) knows her daughters tickets out of town include beauty and brains and she promotes this via beauty pageants. Bliss hates this endless parade while her younger sister grabs hold of it. (Begin teen drama.) One day Bliss discovers the big, wild world of Roller Derby and embraces the idea that she can be her own hero. So, she grasps her new dream. (Intensification of teen drama.) Bliss becomes Babe Ruthless, finds her special niche, adds new life to the ""We're Number 2!"" Hurl Scouts -- slackers of the Roller Derby world, and meets her nemesis on wheels. Bliss embraces the one thing that makes her feel alive, meets the guy of her dreams and then discovers that the big beauty pageant is on the same day as the final Roller Derby face off. (Explosion of teen drama begins here.)

The drama is predictable but the characters are fun and the sports anti-hero concept is fresh. The Roller Derby action keeps the film speeding over film obstacles. My favorite parts of the film all included coach Razor (Andrew Wilson) and his hilarious, dry delivery. Pure entertainment with some laughs and a few feel good, awww moments.

Notes for parents. Teen drinking is an issue, however, there are consequences. One sexual conversation is especially verbally graphic in a scene where Bliss helps gross out her friend so she vomits.",1265241600,2,1498,4.866666666666666
4001521,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Much more fun than I was expecting, `Whip It' is the equivalent of girl power personified by the coming of age inevitableness of life.  With a sharp and witty directorial debut by Drew Barrymore (who doesn't just LOVE her?), and a great cast (seriously, this ensemble is better than nearly every ensemble SAG chose to nominate), `Whip It' is a whole lot of fun; period.

The film revolves around a young and awkward teenager named Bliss.  Her mother is controlling and her father avoids confrontation at all costs.  Bliss is a social outcast (as is made clear in the opening scene, she only has one friend) who is longing for something that makes her even slightly happy.  That is when a stroke of odd luck places her in the right place at the right time.  She catches a glimpse of happiness in the form of roller derby chicks.  After attending her first match, and officially declaring the roller clad females her new heroes, Bliss is persuaded to try-out for the team.  She smudges her age and lies to her parents and soon becomes the new `it' girl on the roller derby circuit.

Bliss Cavendar by day, Babe Ruthless by night.

I really like Ellen Page.  I really think that she is headed places.  Between her Oscar nominated turn in `Juno', her stunning (and quite different) turn in the previous years `Hard Candy' and now her memorable and touching performance here she has really proven she has range and is not just a one-trick pony (as some tried to make claim to after her `Smart People' performance proved to be very similar to her `Juno' one).  She finds a real soul in Bliss, exploiting (in a good way) everything that makes her, and her alter-ego, so special.

Really, it is the acting (and Drew's brisk direction) that makes this film a must see.

Mrs. Harden is always in top form for me and I really enjoy watching her act, so she was a delight for me.  She breathes life into a clichd character (very clichd when you think about it) and makes her feel fresh and new.  Alia Shawkat is splendid as Bliss's best friend Pash, and the nerdy Carlo Alban is effective, even if the film isn't really interested in him.  Landon Pigg is a stock boyfriend, but he has this boyish charm to him that makes him endearing even if he is rather unattractive.  Jimmy Fallon and Andrew Wilson really make the most of their characters (Fallon is especially funny) and Daniel Stern is sweet and tender as Bliss's father (the scene in the van in particular is a subtle yet heart tugging moment of paternal affection).

And then you have all the roller derby ladies!

Kristen Wiig, Eve, Drew Barrymore, Zoe Bell and especially Juliette Lewis are all in top form.  Wiig delivers her lines with a soft and affectionate tone that makes her feel like a real person (and that mother/daughter talk in the car was especially effective, endearing without every coming over sappy and out of place for the films humorous direction).  Barrymore demoted herself to slapstick sidekick, but she is HILARIOUS!  Lewis takes the cake for me with her ferocious take on Iron Mavon, Babe Ruthless's arch nemesis.  She appears like a stock villain in the beginning, with a little extra kick to make her pop out at you, but as the film progresses and she has her confrontation with Bliss you really see the other side to this woman, and remarkably Lewis was able to evoke a real sense of painful anger in her voice.

Like I said, this ensemble is stellar.

There are some plot holes.  It strikes me as rather ridiculous to conclude that Bliss could attend all those games without her very strict mother ever catching on.  Sure, she lied and had some alibis in the beginning, but she was out a lot and late at night, so it didn't really make sense.  The general plot point of Bliss alienating herself after finding something `new' seemed a little `been there done that', as did her conflicts with her mother, but they are forgivable.  The love interest side plot was a little predictable and kind of silly, but I like the directorial flourishes (the love scene in the pool, while `strange', was engaging and interesting to watch) found within it.

In the end I was very satisfied with this film.  I give it a very high B (B+ even) and strongly recommend it for any fan of the genre or the cast.  It is sweet, funky, witty and ultimately full of enough to win you over completely.",1265241600,3,4349,4.569032258064516
4001522,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Not all movies are made to be Oscar contenders. Many are made to simply fill theater seats and offer solid entertainment and an enjoyable time. More often than not, these films offer a chance to see heroes made or characters that get the opportunity to follow their dreams. Such is the case with WHIP IT, the directorial debut of Drew Barrymore.

Bliss Cavender (Ellen Page) is an unenthusiastic beauty queen contestant. Fulfilling the dreams of her mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) more than herself, Bliss does as she is told between school and working at the local BBQ restaurant. Bliss feels nothing more than trapped in small town Bowdeen, Texas.

While clothes shopping with her mother in Austin, Bliss happens to see a group of girls on skates come into the store they're in. Leaving behind a stack of flyers, Bliss picks one up to see that these are roller derby competitors trying to promote their next match.

Sneaking off with best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat), Bliss is totally taken in by the whole scene. The match takes place in a converted warehouse where emcee Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon) announces the girls as they make their way to the track. With names like Iron Maven, Smashly Simpson and Maggie Mayhem you can tell this is no skate in the park. The girls come out rocking and knocking, making an impression on young Bliss. When she tells Maggie afterwards that she is her new hero, Maggie suggests she come to practice and try out.

Once home, Bliss begins skating once more in her Barbie skates, remnants of times gone by. She progresses from just being able to stand to skating through town. The day comes and she sneaks off again for Austin just in time to try out. With more speed than most of the rest trying out, Bliss gets her chance. Now all she has to do is sneak off to the matches.

The girls welcome Bliss in as one of the Hurl Scouts, a losing team that has resolved to stay in last place. But with the speed Bliss shows them and the ribbing they take from the other squads, the team slowly gels into a force to be reckoned with. It also makes Bliss a target for Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis), an aging star who wants to retain her position.

Along the way Bliss also picks up a new boyfriend. Oliver (Landon Pigg) is a member of a band that played at one of the house parties thrown by the team. The pair seems to connect but an upcoming tour tosses them into the possibility of a break up.

As Bliss, now known as Babe Ruthless, moves into the world of roller derby, she begins to distance herself from her friends. And when her parents find out about her lies (as does her team when it's revealed she's too young to skate without her parent's permission), Bliss finds herself alone.

The team now has a chance at the finals. The only thing stopping this from happening is Bliss' family. Resigned to beauty pageants once more, Bliss heads out to a new contest, her mother's favorite, the same night as the big contest. Is there a chance of her making it? Come on, this is a movie folks!

Is this movie believable? No way. First off no league would put themselves in the position of being shut down due to a teenager not being old enough. And the chances of walking in off the street and being better than anyone else? Slim to none. But it doesn't matter. What matters is feeling a sense of hope for Bliss as she has that opportunity to move beyond a life she hates into one she loves, finding that one thing in life that makes her feel more than she has ever before.

The acting in the film is solid, especially by Ellen Page. Changing from the shy Bliss who enters contests at her mothers request to becoming the young woman who makes her own decisions is fleshed out in her performance. Page has done such a great job with various roles in films like JUNO, HARD CANDY and even X-MEN that I'm beginning to think she's one of the best actresses around these days.

The supporting cast also does a great job. Barrymore takes on a small part as one of the derby girls as does singer Eve and stuntwoman Zoe Bell. But the one who stood out for me was Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem. Wiig is one of the series regulars on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE these days and what I've seen of her there is far too over the top. But like Robin Williams when given the right director, she comes through with a great performance as a single mom skater who acts as surrogate mom to Bliss.

Barrymore's first outing as director shows that she can put together a well made film. It's entertaining, fun and delivers everything the previews said it would. As I said, this isn't Oscar material but it is a fun film. Predictable at times but its less about the end result and more about the path taken to get there that makes movies like these work or fail. In this case, the movie works. So take a couple turns around the track and give this one a look.",1265068800,5,4856,4.41340782122905
4001523,2,B002VPTJNQ,"If you pour heavy cream into a cold bowl and add sugar, vanilla and air, you get one of the tastiest concoctions known to man. If you mix water, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated coconut oil, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, some flavors, gums, and glues, and freeze it, you get something that looks like whipped cream but bears no other resemblance.

This film aspires to be whipped cream, but is tepid whip at best. Start with every teenager-as-protagonist cliche: overbearing, obsessive mother, browbeaten father, cute-as-a-button-little sister, no-one-understands me teen. Add quirky best friend. Stir in newly-met sexy person of opposite sex who looks trustworthy, but, oh well. Mix in a bunch of wild and crazy supporting characters (and make sure one of them drives a cool 60's car, MG if possible, but Karmann Ghia will do in a pinch.) Seen this film a hundred times before?

After the viewer is thoroughly bored, pour in a healthy dose of plodding action. Now, I've been to lots of roller derby bouts. They can be very exciting. But those I've attended looked nothing like the action shown here. These were both too fast, as our little inexperienced skater scooted through huge crowds effortlessly, and too slow, as the camera tried to create action where there was none. The failure of the roller derby scenes would not doom the film. Heck, this could be a stage play with some Equus-style skating. But since they went to the effort to try to create it, it did not work.

OK, so by now you've got a cliche-riddled tepid mixture of overcooked and bland ingredients. But then, just to show your culinary skills, drop in the most silly and outlandish ""Lose your virginity"" scene ever filmed. Toss in the requisite ""parents coming to the teen's point of view"" conclusion, and you have created Bland Whip.

The script falls so flat - how can a movie about women's roller derby be so lethargic?  And yet, it is. Most of the action scenes are destroyed by the horrible casting of Jimmy Fallon who's play-by-play banter is just plain annoying and grating and ... bad.  Page is good, but her brittle, smarty-pants schtick is showing it's limitations in a role that calls for more warmth. Wiig and MGH fare best.

Since it's off season for the local derby team right now it's a great way to get keep the derby spirit alive.  My only complaint about the dvd and it's a small complaint is the lack of special features.  I saw that the Blu Ray version has a short making of feature...the standard DVD just has a single disk with a few outtakes.

4001531,5,B002VPTJNQ,"""Whip It"" stars Ellen Page (""Juno"") as Bliss Cavendar, a misfit in the town of Bodeen, Texas.  Her mom, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), longs for Bliss to make an impression in the local Bluebonnet Southern Belles pageant, but Bliss is drawn to the Holy Rollers, a roller derby team from nearby Austin.  Tired of being straitjacketed by her family's expectations, Bliss eventually lands a spot on a rough-and-tumble roller derby team.
 ""Whip It"" marks actress Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, and she knows how to tell a fast-paced fairy tale of a young woman finding a comfortable, if odd, niche in life.  Ms. Barrymore appears briefly as Smashley Simpson, and Kristin Wiig (""Saturday Night Live"") stars as Maggie Mayhem, but Ms. Page and Ms. Harden are clearly the focus of ""Whip It.""  Their scenes ring true, and we can understand both Brooke's desire to have her daughter fit in and Bliss' rebellious streak.  The roller skating sequences are excitingly staged, and the film has an overall happy feel to it, despite the conflict between Bliss and her Mom.  The two-disc Blu-ray edition contains 17 deleted scenes, an alternate opening, audio commentary, several theatrical trailers, and a digital copy.  ""Whip It"" is also available on DVD.",1264636800,,1242,5.053921568627451

It takes some sneeking around and mistakes along the way, but she perseveres til her whole family is mostly on her side and proud of her--especially Dad--he finally was able to put a staked picture of Babe Ruthless as a TXRD (yes, I'm originally from TX). Marsha Gaye Harden was the essentially pushy pagent Mom who sort of came around in the end. This was definitely a feel good movie even though they didn't win the title match.

We had a good time watching the movie and laughing at the bouts and skating on a banked tracked.  The Indy teams use a flat track and do not have all the fights that Whip It had.  This was more of a Fifties and Sixties Roller Derby that was on TV back then.  One thing it did show was that the girls were just nornmal people. Having met many of the Naptown Girls and Socalites, I know that they all come from average life's.  I would recomemnd getting a copy of Whip It and then going to a live bout of Roller Derby.

4001536,4,B002VPTJNQ,"If you want a feel-good movie and have fun, this is it. It is Drew Barrymore's first directorial effort. She goes for fun, and achieves it. The lead is played by Ellen Page. She is too little and petite for a real kick-ass skater, but I don't mind. The story is predictable but as I said it is all so much fun. Ellen's bra in her love scenes is very pretty, but all the love scenes are romantic rather than erotic. Ellen Page absolutely throws herself into every role she has had. She can be a horrifying, vengeful 14 year old (Hard Candy), an unhappy conservative young student (Smart People)or of course Juno, the lovable pregnant 16 year old, and other characters. Each she does convincingly. If Ellen Page is in a movie, there is at least one reason to see it.
  I shouldn't neglect the others. The supporting actors are all great. Barrymore has a small supporting role but is a riot. The other skaters hold their own in delivering fun and support. The skating scenes are full of action but are not graphically gory. The names are fun too: Smashley Simpson, Babe Ruthless, Iron Maven, Maggie Mayhem etc. I'm not going to go into more detail. This enough for me. If you want fun, this is it. Maybe you noticed I used ""fun"" about 6 or more times. That says it all.",1260316800,2,1266,4.405982905982906
4001537,5,B002VPTJNQ,"Contact sport and girls, yet the men in this movie hardly play a diminished role. For the ladies there is no pandering, or fainting, or feigning but the women display all the machismo of male athletics without all of the overly serious attitudes which are so much connected with big money. Instead, they compete for the fun and pride of it without any apology. They wear their bruises and sweat like medals.

In short the story that this movie superbly and entertainingly tells is the new one that says women are every bit as competitive and competent as men and without the nurturing that men receive, such as in this culture boys are nurtured to go into contacts sports, and when they get hurt not cry. Notice, ""every bit as"" not ""more than"". Women don't have to be more than, they can, however, expect to be equal and this movie depicts that winesomely.

The relational conflict between the main character and her mother reflects this gender bias on an even different level and takes it one step further - into the arena of healing, respect, and understanding. Good for you Drew Barrymore for making this movie your directorial debute!

The icing on the cake is when the girl found then lost boy, and boy was that good! When all things were put into perspective, the boy was simply a distraction - pleasant as that was and no apologies given for pleasure either - how refreshing. The girl needed to lose the boy so that she could find her own mojo. Bottom line, the girl can get a new boy.

The only true comparison to formula in this movie - because this story took sterotypes and turned them on their ear - is the male sports movie. This time, the girl and the girls get what the men in aforementioned formula sports stories got. Bravo and Bravo! A superb story and an outstanding sports movie.",1258848000,5,1799,4.54320987654321

4001539,4,B002VPTJNQ,"WHIP IT is a great example of how perfect casting and an infectious enthusiasm can overcome a many problems in a film.  In the case of Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, those problems are primarily an exceedingly predictable plot and occasional sketchy characterizations.

The star of the show is Ellen Page as a highschooler nearing graduation with no idea what she wants to do to get out of her depressing Texas small-town.  For years, her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) has dragged her through the beauty pageant circuit, but it's clear that Page takes NO joy in it.  She works at a diner with her best friend (""Arrested Development's"" Alia Shawkat...and is mostly  just shuffling through life.  One day, she finds a flyer advertising a roller derby taking place in the city...and she decides to go.  Clearly, something has struck her interest...and when she sees what the game is all about, a fire is lit within her.  She tries out for the team, makes it, and naturally, becomes a bit of a sensation.  Will her team rise from last place to a season-ending confrontation with their bitter rivals?  Will her mother eventually discover her secret and be deeply hurt by it?  Will there be some romance, some laughter and some tears?

What do you think?

But director Barrymore has been blessed with a stellar cast.  First of all, she has cast herself in a minor role as a roller girl.  Barrymore herself is one of the more charming and infectious performers around.  She is not so much a great ACTOR as she is an engaging person to spend two hours with.  It would seem that her own personality infused everyone in the film.  Her filming of the action sequences is hardly earth-shattering, and sometimes the pacing of the story flags a little bit

Ellen Page, playing sassy, wry but not nearly as smart as JUNO...seems somewhat liberated by this crazy role, which allows her to skate a lot, kick some butt and essentially play a hero that's right in her comfort zone.  She is a wonderful actor, and while WHIP IT is a film of modest ambition...she still manages to elevate it by her very presence.

But almost everyone else is strong as well.  Marcia Gay Harden works well, because her character is the one that seems sapped of energy and excitement.  She is the mother who clearly had bigger dreams for herself than what her life delivered (another clich) and she lives vicariously through the accomplishments of her daughters (another clich).  Harden has always been good at this kind of attitude...although it's rare to see her in a lower-middle-class role...but she keeps it simple and believable.  Daniel Stern plays her husband...it feels like years since I've seen him in anything, and I really liked him as the ""good-ole-boy"" father...a man who doesn't really understand the women in his life, but isn't afraid to let them know he loves them unconditionally, and that he's there for them when the going gets tough.

Shawkat is loads of fun as Page's best friend.  And the roller derby team itself is filled with wacky characters...but Kristen Wiig (who, on ""Saturday Night Live"" can play some deeply unlikable and disturbing characters) shines as a relatively normal single-mom who offers some words of wisdom to Page at a key moment (another clich).  She gives a grounded, generous performance.  I've really come to like her in movies...where frequently on SNL she is simply off-putting.  Zo Bell (the great stuntwoman from Tarantino's DEATH PROOF) simply bursts with energy.  And the frightening looking Juliette Lewis plays the ""villain"" of the other team...but even she finds a few new things to bring to an essentially cardboard character.

So we've got lots of cookie-cutter characters doing many predictable things.  Yet it all works remarkably well because the cast if fully invested in making WHIP IT a blast.  I went in hoping to have a good time, and I left not the least disappointed.  It put a smile on my face almost immediately, and it mostly stayed there all evening.  That, quite frankly, is a very welcome accomplishment for Barrymore and company.",1255478400,3,4070,4.856313497822931
4001540,4,B002VPTJNQ,"A misfit Texas teen whose mother has dreams of beauty pageant glory in mind finds her niche when she discovers Roller Derby.  It's a wacky premise for a movie but it is one of the best coming of age films I've seen in a while.

Bliss is failing miserable at being the debutante beauty queen he mother wants her to be. Then, one day while shopping in Austin, she discovers the sport of women's roller derby.

The movie is just a lot of fun kind of like a girl's night out with your BFF's.  It also has its touching moments and there's a little romance as well.  Drew Barrymore did a great job directing and she's quite a character as a tough but ditzy roller derby chick.
There's a little foul language and drinking/sexual references so not for the younger ones.  I'd say 12-13 would be the youngest I'd take to see it.

4001541,4,B002VPTJNQ,"Getting your first set of wheels is quite a coming of age, but most people who think in terms of wheels have a motor vehicle on their minds.  In Bliss Cavendar's (Ellen Page of ""Juno"") those wheels are a pair of roller skates.

When we first see young Bliss, she's competing in the Bluebonnet Pageant at the direction of her Mom (Marcia Gay Harden). Bliss has got some pretty big shoes to fill since Mom won and her little sister seems to be destined to go all the way in pageantland.

But, tiaras and talent contests aren't really what Bliss is about.  A shopping trip to Austin, TX changes her life when she meets a bunch of roller derby girls.  She's invited to try out and lies about her age (she has to be 21) to do so.  Even on her old Barbie skates, she's fast enough to make it.

And Babe Ruthless is born.  Timid at first, Bliss gradually gets in the groove.  Big surprise, her team The Hurl Scouts is no longer settling for losing the game.  There's a lot of humor and heart in this story and many of us are seeing a sport that we don't often encounter in a way that changes a lot of perspectives on it and the young women who engage in it.

Shauna Cross's YA novel bearing the same name translated really well into a great young adult film capable of following in ""Juno's"" very large shoes.  Their producer, Drew Barrymore, who also appears as ""Smashley Simpson"" one of Bliss's team members.

If you loved ""Juno"" and Ms. Page's witty performance, you are at least going to like this film.  Maybe not for pageant moms, but the message is strong -- every young girl deserves her 'bliss' whether it's wearing a tiara or a pair of skates.

Here again she demonstrates extraordinary acting presence, playing the role of the heroine, showing that she can whip it real good, demonstrating what an every woman appeal she has, while proving that she is a force that will be with us for a long time.

Whip it explores the rough and tumble world of roller through the lens of a seventeen year old girl looking for a way out of her sheltered existence working as a waitress at the Oink Joint in Bodeen Texas, out of the sheltering but somothering wings of her mother who wants her daughter to live out her dream of winning a beauty pageant.

Some girls rollerskate into the shoe store where she is shopping, and pick up a pamphlet about a roller derby.  A little dazzled by them, and filled with a burning curiosity, she picks up a pamphlet and so begins her journey down the rabbit hole, into this new exciting illicit world as different from Bodine as you can imagine, and a secret adventure.

Along the way she has many trials and tribulations, makes new friends, and ultimately must choose between fulfilling her mother's dream or her own dream.

After seeing this movie I would love to go to a roller derby event.  In this movie, you will see Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, Andrew Wilson (Owen Wilson's brother) as the coach, Drew Barrymore, the very talented Kirsten Wiig of SNL, Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden plays the mother, also features Juliette Lewis as her archrival and this is the first movie Drew Barrymore has directed, and she does a tremendous job.  An excellent cast that elevates this movie somewhat above the ordinary.

4001543,4,B002VPTJNQ,"""Whip It"" is surprisingly good in spite of itself, conventional as a sports movie yet mature in its development of character. It's also an entertaining spectacle, which is relief for me since I've never given much thought to women's Roller Derby (or even sports in general, but that's a topic for another day). Drew Barrymore has done well to hype it as her directorial debut; she proves that she not only has the technical skills, but also the ability to move a story along through dialogue, pacing, and emotion. Having practically grown up in front of the camera, I think it's safe to assume she knows a thing or two about what a film needs in order for it to work. The first thing she did right was cast Ellen Page, who has repeatedly demonstrated just how versatile an actress she is.

She's no exception here. She plays seventeen-year-old Bliss Cavendar, who was raised in a middle-of-nowhere Texas town and gets by as a diner waitress. Her overbearing mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), a product of a very different set of standards, pressures Bliss into competing in beauty pageants, believing you have to make do with what you've got when you're young and attractive. When Bliss is made aware of a Roller Derby match in nearby Austin, she decides to go and see what all the fuss is about. Lo and behold, she likes what she sees. She then meets Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), a teammate for the Hurl Scouts, and is encouraged to try out for the team. Maggie is one of several teammates that has adopted a clever nickname; some of the other Hurl Scouts are Smashley Simpson (Drew Barrymore), Rosa Sparks (Eve), and the Manson Sisters (Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica).

Under the guise of taking an SAT studies class, Bliss sneaks away to Austin every week for practice. Conflict abounds: Not only have the Hurl Scouts never won a single game, Bliss' teammates are also unaware that she's underage (you have to be twenty-one in order to be considered for Roller Derby). By the time she starts participating in matches, she develops a rivalry with Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis), the confrontational leader of undefeated champions of Roller Derby, the Holy Rollers. Nevertheless, Bliss has never felt more alive. At long last, she has found something she loves to do, and she does it with people she enjoys being around. Eventually, she will have to find and maintain that delicate balance between her passion, her family, and her life back home, a process that isn't as easy as it might seem.

One could see this film just for the satisfaction of watching an uplifting, inspirational sports film, as has been done so many times before. For me, what made this movie so enjoyable were the characters, most so interesting and well developed that they seemed authentic. Bliss, for example, is willful and determined, yet not so haughty that she only seems like a spoiled brat. There's a remarkably tender side to her, and yes, some of it is reserved for her mother. It would have been easy to write Brooke as a controlling, spiteful stereotype, but all of that is avoided--despite having unrealistic expectations and a dated ideal of successful womanhood, she genuinely cares about her daughter, and we sense that all throughout. The only character who poses a bit of a problem is Bliss' father, Earl (Daniel Stern), seemingly included just for the sake of physically and morally clashing with his wife.

Other characters function as quirky interludes, like Bliss' supportive best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat), the Hurl Scouts' eccentric coach, Razor (Andrew Wilson), and the boisterous Roller Derby announcer, ""Hot Tub"" Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon). The screenplay even has room for a teen romance between Bliss and a guitarist named Oliver (Landon Pigg), who eventually swaps his coat for Bliss' Stryper tee shirt (which she claims is the only cool thing her mother ever gave her). Most of these characters, the last one especially, are expected, as is the inevitable final match between the Hurl Scouts and the Holy Rollers. And yet, it all comes together smoothly, making for a fun and endearing film that you'll want to see through to the end.

The game sequences are quite effective on their own, not only because of the well choreographed skating maneuvers, but also because of the camerawork; every shot exploits the spectacle that is Roller Derby, gliding in time with the actors as they zoom over and around each other on an inclined track. Other shots reveal the grungy feel of a Roller Derby event, from the makeshift arena to the ramshackle benches to the screaming fans, most of whom look no older than twenty. This is interesting in and of itself, given the fact that, save for Bliss, all the teammates are in their early to late thirties; one of them even has a young son. Knowing these women are mostly in it for the love of the game, one wonders how long Bliss can keep playing right alongside them. But if there is a message attached to ""Whip It,"" it has nothing to do with what the future may or may not bring; this movie is all about living in the now and loving every minute of it.",1255046400,43,5104,4.762711864406779
4001544,4,B002VPTJNQ,"It's official: Until further notice, I will happily see any movie featuring Ellen Page. As in previous movies, Page does an outstanding job in bringing her angsty teenage character to life. This time, she's a slightly lost seventeen year old being herded around by a pageant-passionate mother. The first glimmering that she might have goals of her own comes when she sees roller derby girls dropping off flyers for an upcoming event. Of course, she sneaks out to see it using a pretext transparent to everyone but her parents, and she is transfixed. After the show, she tells one of the skaters, ""You guys are my heroes!"" The tattooed derby girl answers, ""Come to the tryout - be your own hero."" And she does.

The rest follows an inspiring and hilarious season of sneaking around the parents, doing her part to bring the last-place team to the championship. As you might expect, the poo hits the fan when pageant-panicked Mom finds out that her little beauty queen has another life as Babe Ruthless. I found the parent/teen flareups somewhat milder than realistic, but then the rapprochement was unconvincingly minor, too.

But, if that tension had been much tenser, a lot of the movie's core fun would have been hidden. Barrymore, in her debut role as director, clearly had fun making this and the fun comes through in the final product. The girl-power, be-who-you-are messages come through without shrillness, and Page's navigation of teen heartbreak leaves her character convincingly in the lead. One scene near the very end, her father with hammer in hand (wait for it) was a bit predictable, but satisfying none the less. As was the whole movie. I don't always want a movie that takes itself too seriously. When you want a fun bit of fluff with plenty of physical comedy, give this one a shot. It's well worth the time spent seeing it.
