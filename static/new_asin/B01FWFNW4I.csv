I collect the old movies as well as new releases and love the genre.  These are for the people like me who appreciate the old and the strides made since those days.",1485820800,,280,4.036363636363636
8761643,5,B01FWFNW4I,"I love these old classics from when my parent's were kids.
This is a LIVE TV series that aired for 3 seasons from the early 1950's.  It's especially cool that they aired it LIVE. You get to see the original sponsor ads on these DVDs which is also cool. The stories aren't the greatest, many are poorly written but it's fun 50's TV.  It's almost like watching a live theater play. It's nostalgic even for someone of my age not from the 50's.
I was happy to add these to my 1950's Movie and TV series collection!",1485475200,,510,4.247422680412371
