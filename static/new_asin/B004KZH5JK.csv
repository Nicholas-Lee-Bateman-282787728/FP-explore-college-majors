4398734,1,B004KZH5JK,"So bad, turned it off...not sure how it made into the ""family/children"" category. We turned it off after they were rubbing a magic crystal and the main character could ""smell"" the pregnancy of another character. Um, EXPLAIN THAT to an 8 yr old? PASS.",1310947200,4,250,4.704545454545454
4398735,5,B004KZH5JK,"This was a cute family film.  The chihuahua, Peanut, who played Bella did an amazing job.  While this is a low budget film, it was a story with a good message.  It was great to see a film that did not have any violence or bad language in it.  If you are a Chihuahua lover, this is a good film for you.",1310688000,7,301,3.806451612903226
4398736,5,B004KZH5JK,"This movie is so cute! I am a Chihuahua owner and I loved watching this with my Chi. It would be a great film for families or Chihuahua lovers like myself!

But, this movie is a low-budget film, don't go to it expecting A+ acting or expect to be like multi-million dollar movies like Beverly Hills Chihuahua. For what it is, it's a great movie with a moving story, (I teared up at the end!), an adorable Chihuahua, and some humor.

Conclusion: if you are thinking of getting this, odds are you like Chihuahuas. So just get it! I found mine at wal-mart for only 5$. Worth every penny.",1310688000,34,583,4.339449541284404
4398737,1,B004KZH5JK,"WE RENTED THIS MOVIE FROM REDBOX, THINKING IT WAS ONE OF THE REAL CHIHUAHUA MOVIES LIKE THE BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA MOVIES. IT WAS AWFUL! IT WAS A VERY LOW BUDGET MOVIE AND THE ACTORS WERE VERY BAD. THE COVER OF THE MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE. THE STORY LINE IS SO LAME AND THERE ARE VERY RANDOM DRAWN OUT SCENES THAT NEEDED TO BE TAKEN OUT. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE EVEN WATCHED THE WHOLE MOVIE! I GUESS WE WERE HOPING IT WOULD GET BETTER IN THE END? I DON'T KNOW.
YA, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.",1310688000,3,520,4.107843137254902
4398738,4,B004KZH5JK,"We are huge Chihuahua fans so we checked this movie out.  While the human acting was not the best, the pup was delightful.  I loved this doggy better than Beverly Hills Chihuahua as there was no CGI just a cutie chihuahua acting up a storm!  Plus the story was compelling, we laughed and cried. Though my 8 year old got upset at some scenes, I would say this is a great family movie for sevenish an above.  Yeah Chihuahuas!",1310515200,8,423,4.3164556962025316
4398739,1,B004KZH5JK,"Beware:
This movie was so bad that we regretted renting it after the first 5 minutes.  The acting is bad and the movie did not hold the attention of anyone in the room.  Terrible!!!  Do not waste your money or time.",1310515200,5,215,4.195121951219512
4398740,1,B004KZH5JK,"Could any movie be as bad as this one?  The acting was amateurish and the no one could sympathize with the characters.  Even the dogs, who usually steal the show, did not provide much entertainment.  I guess I was looking for a Bruiser from Legally Blonde kind of movie.  Don't waste your money.",1309564800,3,295,4.509433962264151

We loved watching her interact with her cast mates in the movie. It seemed like she is very well-trained! She actually was a better actress in the whole movie :-)
The storyline kept our interest throughout the movie. We even cried at parts of it!
I think that this is a great movie for families wit children and for other Chihuahuas like myself.",1302307200,9,505,4.5

4398753,1,B004KZH5JK,"I love chihuahuas, and i love movis about dogs. I even love silly, low budget movies. But this isn't so much a movie as a punishment. You remember when your parents told you watching TV would rot your brain? After watching this movie, I finally understand what they were talking about. Its about an unkind woman who gets turned into a Chihuahua by her friend's quartz necklace. But what really makes this movie so terrible is the acting. I refuse to believe that anyone in this movie was genuinely trying to act. Ill just say the best acting was delivered by Peanut, the actual Chihuahua. The only people I could see getting enjoyment from this movie are toddlers, but I don't think it would hold their attention for too long.",1480377600,2,726,4.592307692307692

An innocent chi is possessed by a workaholic nutritionist who must, through the eyes of the chi, watch her body slowly disintegrate in the ICU of a local hospital.

Her human persona has not a clue what an unhappy, unpleasant, uncaring person she has become . . . lets visit her childhood and a friend that knew her before her parents divorced. Now that friend has learned about magic and chooses to help. Follow the adventure, not the acting . . . this is more about life's responsibilities.

If you want a good family friendly film then I invite you to check out this adorable simple film.  A mean harpy learns a lesson, yes we've seen this plot many times before, but when paired up with the most adorable little doggy and good performance by Renee Pezzotta, whose acting lessons clearly shine above everyone else, you can't go wrong with a way to spend a lazy afternoon with your loved ones.

4398858,3,B004KZH5JK,"I love all the negative reviews for this movie. Like, there are scores of people who seem legitimately angry at this movie, like it has somehow wronged them by not being some kind of Oscar-nominated, Michael Bay-esque blockbuster action film. Thing is, though, this movie was made for children, and possibly dogs. That's it, that's the bottom line. There's no deep meaning, there isn't any hidden message or moral outcome or anything like that. This is a straight-up, ""oooh, look at the cute doggie"" movie, and that's it.

I purchased this at a truck stop store. I had my dog with me, and I thought it would be ironic and kind of funny to get the movie with whatever else I was purchasing, and make some kind of comment that it was the dog that's been pestering me to watch it. I was willing to spend the $4 the movie cost for that joke -- a joke which the cashier didn't even seem to appreciate all that much (I guess they get weirder in there than a guy and his chihuahua).

Having purchased it, though, I had to watch it. So I sat down with my dog one evening and powered through it. And I'll admit... the movie is weird at times. There are some parts of it that just don't make sense. I'm still wondering what happens to the chihuahua at the end. The acting is terrible, and the cinematography is questionable. The plot is... well, it's there.

Again, though, it's made for children. Comparing this to other movies is like rating a Ford Focus poorly because it's not a good Ferrari. Does it deserve one star? No, because for what it is -- an hour and some worth of kid-friendly fluff -- it does it admirably, and with a dog that's a decent enough actor. My dog seemed to enjoy it well enough, and if I was six, I might have, as well.",1445558400,,1737,4.338461538461538

What I am about to write may seem like sour grapes but it isn't.  I'm going to give you some industry insider information.  Amazon seems to be inundating Amazon Prime with low budget indie films that some guy named ""Steve"" perhaps in Reading, Pennsylvania wrote, financed (well his Mom did anyway) and then found some mediocre non-union actors to be in.  Most of the positive reviews likely come from people related to the production.  This is becoming a common scenario with Amazon.  They accept terrible films so they can claim they have more content than Netflix and tell the owners of the bad film that if they get enough positive reviews then they will get some money.  So, everyone related to the film is then asked to review it favorably with lies.  This film reeks of this.  I've witnessed this with other films first hand.

Folks, when an item on Amazon has 200 reviews and 30% of them are one star reviews, you should run away fast.",1403568000,,1187,4.563981042654029

4398963,4,B004KZH5JK,"Chihuahua is right for the family values we are lacking now a days.  We should all wake up and not be so negative to others.  When so many individuals would appreciate a kind word a smile or a chat to make ones day and possibly make your day if you tried being kinder to others.  A dog, a cat, a rabbit or chicken can show you how they are treated and how they give you unconditional love every moment of the day.

Children can learn as well as adult to be kinder and then they will receive kindness in return.  Animals help many in our society, we seem to forget how much they help terminal ill children, terminally ill adults and the elderly who have such a short time left in our world.

I enjoyed the simple things it said and the lessons we are never to old to learn.  Be kind to one another and you may receive kindness in return.

Good casting, and directing to show you that even actors and directors see how much better life would be if we tried a little harder, as our animals do for us daily.  Get a pet if you don't believe me.

Watch and learn from this movie and do it with your children.

The acting is bad, the credits at the beginning are poorly done and boring - I fast forwarded past them - and the plot is almost non-existent. It was obviously a low budget production. The plot is that this woman's childhood friend mysteriously appears and magically puts her mind/soul into the body of a chihuahua. Who knows what happened to the mind/spirit of the chihuahua while this was going on? It did not go into the woman's human body, which starts to die because there is no longer a soul animating it. In order to get back into her human body, the woman has to learn to be happy and kind. She does this by becoming a therapy dog. Unfortunately, her human body dies before she learns this lesson, then her dog body dies as well, then the witch brings them both back to life, to the shock of the hospital attendants moving her 'dead' human body and to the joy of the chihuahua owner.

I agree that the dog is the best actor in the film, but if you can wade through the rest of the bad acting, the story is sort of sweet.  The description is wrong, in that Bella is not Sondra's dog.

4399016,1,B004KZH5JK,"I normally don't negatively review movies, but I definitely felt the need to write one for this movie. I watched this movie with a 3 year old and a 6 year old, who LOVED Chihuahuas. Thankfully, the 6 year old fell asleep (It was late when we started watching it). This movie had my 3 year old terrified and to be honest, it freaked me out, too! We had to turn it off. There was witchcraft in it and the lady that put the ""spell"" on the woman made the scariest faces with her eyes. I was horrified that my 3 year old saw what she did. :(  We are going to throw this away. If i could have rated it no stars, I would have. Please don't watch this with your kids.",1332720000,2,659,3.954887218045113
4399017,2,B004KZH5JK,"While it's not the absolute worst film I've ever seen, it's the second worst.  The acting is ridiculously horrible, the story line is scary at times and ridiculous the rest of the time.  My six year old watched it fairly attentively, but I think it was just because she was tired.  Save your money, buy Beverley Hills Chihuahua instead.  Way better film, as in there is no comparison.",1329264000,,384,4.602941176470588
4399018,1,B004KZH5JK,"I didn't want to give this movie any stars, one is the minimum.

""Chihuahua, The Movie"" is horrible and depressing - I do not know how this movie was ever made - who actually thought it was a good idea, I'd be ashamed that I paid money to produce it - I am ashamed that it's in my house.  Save your money for something else.  Worst movie EVER!!!",1327017600,4,345,4.044117647058823
4399019,3,B004KZH5JK,"CHIHUAHUA:  THE MOVIE is somewhat a guilty pleasure.  Sure it's cliched, corny, silly and poorly acted.  But the chihuahua is cute and the movie's predictable outcome is satisying.  At least there's no CGI attempts to humanize the animals and there's a sense of reality to the middle-class characters.  The supernatural abilities of Lina are grossly incredulous, but obviously necessary to advance the storyline.
The movie may lack enough action to hold younger kids' attention, may be too corny for older kids, but involving enough for pet loving adults.",1315872000,3,555,5.261363636363637
4399020,1,B004KZH5JK,"This movie is definitely awful and not a kids or family movie. My 10-year old daughter was completely freaked out by the first 10 minutes and I was freaked out at how bad the production values and acting were! It's basically got witchcraft, ""scary ladies with googly eyes,"" lots of sick kids (by the look of the preview screens - we shut it down after the first 10 minutes). Don't get this film if you have children. If you want to watch cute little dogs, buy or rent Beverly Hills Chihuahua.",1314057600,4,492,4.417582417582418
4399021,5,B004KZH5JK,"I did not have a single problem in getting the merchandise ordered .. Amazon is the only logical place to order anything from as
they are ""secure"".  If a problem arises with anything ordered through them, it will be dealt with in a timely manner.  It's
wonderful when companies use Amazon to sell their wares because they have to live up to Amazon's standards.

I did not have any concerns .. the product arrived in grade A condition AND it arrived a little earlier than expected.",1313452800,,480,4.558139534883721

However, the Chihuahua in the film was well-trained and did a great job. This is not a movie for someone expecting ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua.""  Die-hard Chi fans only.",1312416000,10,288,4.877551020408164
8433593,5,B004KZH5JK,I actually liked this movie. I thought at first oh boy another corny movie and it is in a cute way! I am biased though because I have 2 Chihuahuas. Its got a lesson in it that actually could help young children. All and all its cute!,1527465600,,233,3.978723404255319

8433596,1,B004KZH5JK,"This was wretched for me. I really disliked it, I love chihuahua and well the horrid obnoxious woman in the cute dog did not make the woman less annoying just spoiled the dog for me. I wouldn't recommend, even though it is probably geared to a younger audience... The acting was terrible. I didn't last 15 minutes I don't think. :*( I wanted a cute chichi movie.",1519084800,,362,4.417910447761194
8433597,4,B004KZH5JK,"This is a great movie for children. Children have a different sense of pacing than adults, so although this takes its time winding through the story, it makes the evolution of the main character more fun and easy for children to follow. The plot follows the temporary transformation of a stressed-out human being into a therapy dog--allowing her to gain all the experiences that come from making things better for others. For a faster paced, ""Home Alone""-type plot with a chichuahua, try the film ""Ping!"" on Prime.",1518825600,,514,4.919540229885057
