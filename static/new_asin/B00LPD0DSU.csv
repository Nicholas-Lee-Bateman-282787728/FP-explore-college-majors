8667566,1,B00LPD0DSU,"I have only one good thing to say about this movie...the DVD cover is cool, it has nothing to do with the movie, though. The bad, get ready. a girl inherits a house in the middle of nowhere from her real family (she was adopted) she asks 2 friend to go with her, 4 vapid women and one guy go,one girl can't handle bugs so she takes the car keys and strands her friends? She trudges thru the woods in spiked heels? Nice friend. Not one likable character. Bad plot and bad acting. You will get the occasional shirt pull up and wet t-shirts, why? no clue. always a dumb cop. dull as earwax. some ""Deliverance"" types show up, why? no clue. Why not have the cop drive you to town? so many plot holes, you can drive a truck thru. Incredibly predictable ending!",1428451200,,754,4.243055555555555
8667567,5,B00LPD0DSU,"Great to watch with your friends on movie night, it has the perfect recipe of a classic absurd and scary horror flick, with much better actors than Paris Hilton cast-ed :)",1414368000,,171,4.548387096774194
8667568,5,B00LPD0DSU,Good old fashioned horror movie. There's a needless topless scene at the beginning to get it going and life lessons on never leaving your friends.  The picture quality is definitely better than one would expect from your basic horror movie. I have no doubt it will make you scream jump and have a good laugh.,1413158400,2,308,4.6

8667570,2,B00LPD0DSU,"The  opening of the film shows us the birth certificate of Joshua King  b. 4/24/1955 in Copperhead County. The parents are from Wichita, Kansas.  The mother has a maiden name of Olszewski, the same real name as two of the actors in this film. Coincidence? I think not! The seal on the certificate is South Australia with the county being located in California.  At the age of 20, Joshua rapes a girl (1975 by my math),  but we later discovered he wasn't trialed but committed in 1980. Fuzzy math.  The raped girl has a child, but dies at child birth.

After the credits... Shelby (Kate French) inherits the red house from her biological father Marcus King. She was raised by foster parents.  She takes along with her four friends to check out the house also located in primo pot growing country.  They attempted to create clever characters with dialogue that was hit and miss.  Lindsey (Cristen Coppen) becomes my smart mouth favorite while Chelsea (Kat Sheridan) exposes her breasts.

There is a sheriff that comes by, a local whose mother died at child birth.  The house has no electricity, but does have running water and lights in the shed. Okay, a few plot issues, but nothing we haven't seen before.  Guess what? They have no cell phone reception.

Then we get that slasher thing happen (see DVD cover).  Not much to figure out.

F-bomb. Nudity (Kat Sheridan)",1409702400,,1365,4.69620253164557
