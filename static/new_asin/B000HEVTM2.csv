8139043,4,B000HEVTM2,"Very little is known about the peasant Rasputin who rose from being a petty thief into the man who controlled the tsar and tsarina of Russia. We do not really know about his early life and his relationship with the tsarina. Virtually this entire film is imaginary, not based on fact. There is a good summary of his life in the series Hourly History, books that can be read in an hour.
In this film produced by Hammer Studio, Rasputin was a very strong madman who was overly interested in power, alcohol, and sex. He had hypnotic power over women and was able to work his way to the palace by hypnotizing the tsarina's lady in waiting to do his will. Later, when he met the tsarina who was not feeling well, he hypnotized her also to do his will and, thereby, acquired great power.
Christopher Lee is great in this role. He had the lead role in many Hammer Studio films, a company that did many horror films in the 1950s to 1970s, including movies about Dracula, roles he played.
There is a plot in the film where he hypnotizes a girl to kill herself resulting in the girls brother and friend seeking to kill him.",1521676800,,1112,4.3768115942028984
8139044,3,B000HEVTM2,"Goes more for shock than a factual presentation of Grigori Rasputin... and his life was more than a little shocking without embellishment. As a horror movie it does well enough but it is not even remotely historical, especially in the presentation of Rasputin's death. The names are right and it IS set in Russia, but beyond that...",1415491200,2,332,4.842105263157895
8139045,5,B000HEVTM2,This a very campy movie but also a lot of fun to watch. Watch it in this way and not for historical accuracy.,1364688000,4,109,3.782608695652174
