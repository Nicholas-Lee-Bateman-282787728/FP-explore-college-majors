8542735,5,B009L4DT36,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that less known movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Discs last 100s of years.

Above-average World War II naval/spy/romance.  Edward G Robinson is one of the finest actors Hollywood has ever produced.  Lynn Bari, was a film actress who specialized in playing sultry, statuesque, man-killers.  She does not disappoint.  During WWII, according to a survey taken of GIs, Bari was the second-most popular pinup girl after the much better-known Betty Grable.

Lynn Bari was a staunch Republican, Bari actively supported conservative causes, campaigned for Republican presidential candidates from Hoover to Reagan, and was a regular attendee of GOP national conventions.

I'm glad to have this terrific movie in my Blu-ray/DVD collection.",1494547200,,1028,5.283950617283951

8542739,4,B009L4DT36,"This is more of a World War 2 romance and spy melodrama, rather than a shipboard story, since most of the action takes place during shore leave in Mexico.  Model shots appear to be a T2 or T3 oiler.  On board shots are either a set, or a very few on an actual oiler or freighter.  German U-boat is also a model or set.",1434931200,,318,3.9375
