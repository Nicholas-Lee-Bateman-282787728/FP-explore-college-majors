7851584,5,6303627633,"I have been looking for this on DVD for two years now. It is the best exercise tape, but I no longer have a VHS player; because of copyright no one will transfer it for me. I'm willing to pay to buy a new one. Please, someone release this on DVD!",1238630400,,246,3.843137254901961
7851585,5,6303627633,"I own many exercise tapes and DVDs, and this is my favorite.

For once, everyone in the tape is fatter than I am. (I'm 5 foot 4, 211 pounds, 51 years old.)

At first, I couldn't do the whole tape - but if these women, who are fatter than me, can do it, then I can do it, too. I kept at it, and I can now do the whole tape.

When I'm watching skinny 25 year olds on exercise tapes, I often think  ""Sure, it's fine for you to do that - you're young and strong and fit - but I can't do it"".  On the other hand, if these fat women can do it, so can I.

I feel comfortable and capable with this tape.

I just wish it was out on DVD.  I'd re-buy it again in DVD format in a minute.  There aren't many exercise tapes I'd be willing to buy a second time just to get them in my prefered format, but this is one of the few that I would. In fact, that's why I was looking at this product now; I was hoping to find it for sale in DVD.",1200009600,,922,3.6395939086294415
7851586,5,6303627633,"This video is great! It offers 5 sections: Warm up, Cardio 1, Cardio 2, Cardio 3, Cool down, Floor stomach and leg exercises, and stretches. Whew! I thought I could do this video with no problem but I underestimated it. This is a complete workout and I'm VERY happy with this purchsae.",986169600,6,285,4.5
7851587,5,6303627633,"This is the perfect workout - it gets my heart pumping, stretches my muscles, builds strength - and the instructor is clear and pays attention to special cases. Simple moves make this video easy to follow. It's divided  into 5 sections, so it's easy to just do a short workout if you want.",953164800,16,289,4.452830188679245
