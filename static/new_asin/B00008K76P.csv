Plenty of action and one of the best Zatoichi movies as far as stand out scenes go, especially at the end where the Samurai tries to catch Zatoichi off guard by charging in on a horse and using his whip on him. Let me add I don't think there's any such thing as a bad Zatoichi movie but this is one of the better ones. Definitely a good buy.",1354233600,,364,4.0
1849178,5,B00008K76P,Awesome movie. I've always loved Japenese movies and this classic goes down as another BEST in foreign films.  Bring us more ! ! !,1322179200,,130,4.416666666666667
1849179,4,B00008K76P,"Zatoichi is accused of stealing a chess of gold, and not only are the villagers against him, but a sinister ronin with a deadly bull-whip (played by Tomisaburo Wakayama, Shintaro Katsu's older brother) is after him as well. Tons of action and well developed story. A must have for any Zatoichi fan. Highly recommended!",1257206400,,318,4.907407407407407
1849180,5,B00008K76P,"Probably one of the better films in the series for the sole reason that the pace never flags. Some Zatoichi films can get bogged down, usually in dialogue or side stories. However, this film keeps a pace that reminds one of a modern day action flick (at least, an ideal action flick). Of all the Zato stories, I found this one the most engrossing.

Of course, like the other films in the series it is beautifully crafted with gorgeous cinematography and brilliant acting.",1198800000,,471,4.674698795180723

1849182,5,B00008K76P,"This 6th entry of Zatoichi finds the anti-hero Ichi paying his repects at the grave of a samurai he killed by mistake three years prior. It was self-defense, nonetheless, he feels remorse. A young girl hiding behind the trees overhears this self-confession: She was the samurai's sister. Jump ahead in the film, and we come to the villagers who have saved up 1000 Ryo in tax money. After 3 years of bad harvest they have finally been able to scrape enough together to satisfy the intendant. Or have they?

Enter a sadistic bullwhip weilding Ronin named Jushiro [Tomisaburo Wakayama] the main antagonist in the film. (The real life brother of Shintaro Katsu--who also appeared in Zatoichi episode #2.) And he's pretty darn sadistic as Jushiro; and with a pretty unhealthy hatred of Zatoichi. However, he sure plays the sadistic role to the hilt. He does not care about the 1000 ryo, even when offered to him. He wants Zatoichi. Jushiro's hatred for Ichi is because he looks down on him as a low-life masquerading as a swordsman. How many other arrogant villians have we seen like this already? Ah, when will they ever learn?

Ichi is blamed for taking the missing 1000 ryo's, and he resolves to clear his name. The intendant, with the help of Jushiro are already at work however scheming to take the money, tax the people again, and do away with Zatoichi. This always sounds easy over those drinks of saki. But Ichi has a surprise for them. There is a really funny part in the film, where Zatoichi and Jushiro wager on a bet. [I'll let you watch that--it's hilarious, even by Ichi standards] I'll write no more, watch the film, you will enjoy it. The music is good, the cinematography is great, the plot is excellent and the acting is terrific. Highly recommend.",1157328000,6,1761,4.6957928802588995
1849183,5,B00008K76P,"As always, this movie gives you all you want in the zatoichi vein, the emmotional women, the amazing swordsmanship, and the numerous opportunities for Zatoichi to display the character that lasted him thru so many movies.  Mixed up in the search for a lost chest of gold, thieves, and crooked goverment officials, Zatoichi saves the day in his unsual manner.  Not quite as good as the first ones but still worth the price",1046649600,37,421,4.7534246575342465
