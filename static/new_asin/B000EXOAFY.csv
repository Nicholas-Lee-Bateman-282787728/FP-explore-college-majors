2543917,3,B000EXOAFY,"I recently ordered this ""Complete Collection"" to only be disappointed, not with Love Hina the series, but with this product itself. Anime Legends' Love Hina Complete Collection is far from being complete. This title only has 24 of the episodes. What about the 25th episode and the movies? You won't find them here. Love Hina is a great series, and a lot of reviews written on this product will tell you that. I am writing this because I want people to know about the product itself because most people only write about the series. Had I known this, I would have ordered the Love Hina Perfect Collection. 24 episodes, thats it. No more, no less.",1173830400,30,644,4.608695652173913
2543918,5,B000EXOAFY,"First of all, I'd like to say that anyone who has just started collecting Love Hina, STOP buying the seperete DVDS and Buy THIS!! It is much more convienient than having six seperate DVDs taking up all your shelf space. This box set has all six volumes of the TV series, and is only about an inch wide. Definetely get this one!

Anyways, Love Hina is an awesome show. It is really funny, and has a great story. It tells about Keitaro Urashima, who, a long time ago, promised a girl that he would go to Tokyo University with her, because she said that ""Anyone who goes to Tokyo U together, will live happily ever after!"". Now, Keitaro is all grown up, and he has failed the entrance exams to Tokyo University 3 times. He also has had no luck with girls ever in his entire life. When his parents tell him to go and stay at his grandma's inn, Hinata House, he finds out that it's not an inn anymore, it's a girl's dormitory! And his grandma has gone on a world tour. When he meets one of the girls there, Naru Narusegawa, has has a feeling that she may be the girl he made a promise to all those years ago.

The Love Hina anime is good, and extremely funny, but still, it doesn't compare to the manga. Some pretty important stuff gets left out in the anime and some characters that never appear in the manga appear in here, but it still is pretty good. (For instance, Su's sister and brother never appeared in the manga, and neither did Naru's sister.) Also, the other three movies should've just been part of the TV series, not seperate movies. But it's okay.

I would definetely reccomend this series to anyone! To long-time anime collecters, and to people who have just started. Love Hina is a great anime to choose for the start of your collection.

Also, even though the back says that it should be rated 16 and up, well, the actual anime is definetely 13 and up. The original volumes had 13 and up as well. This is for anyone who worries about the ratings.",1153612800,2,1959,4.329700272479564
2543919,5,B000EXOAFY,"This series is fantastic!! However, the manga is of course better. I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!!

A show full of laughter, touching momments, characters you will fall in love with, and girls beating up a poor guy who falls in love with one of them! Of course I should warn you! THIS BOX SET DOES NOT FINISH THE SERIES!!! (well in a way i guess it does...)

TO SEE THE TRUE ENDING YOU WILL NEED TO SEE THE 3 MOVEIES!!

(presented in chrological order)

LOVE HINA.........

""CHRISTMASS SPECIAL""

""SPRING SPECIAL""

AND FINALY ""LOVE HINA AGAIN""

The manga is 14 Vols. and so far one novel has been released.

Yes! This very cute show is a must see!!!!!!",1153180800,,652,4.504273504273504
2543920,5,B000EXOAFY,"Before I write my review, I have to said this.  I like action anime (mostly mecha), my collection goes from Evangelion, Samurai X and Blue Gender among others.  So me buying a comedy is something.  I have read reviews, and a lot of info about this series over the Internet, and a friend of mine told me how good this is.  So, I buy it without seeing it, a risk, but I took it.

I LAUGH MY YOU KNOW WHAT OFF!!!!!  From the beginning, all the way to the end, I was laughing.  Some jokes I didn't get (I guess you have to know a lot of japanese culture to get all the jokes, and see a lot of japanese cinema), but you will get most of it.  Keitaro getting hit/hurt everytime in every episode gets tiresome by the 4th dvd, but since in all harem anime the girls love the guy, this was completly new and original to all who has seen harem anime (I haven't, this is the first time). And there lies the most artistic value of this DVD set.  It is original, and most original of all is the ending.  For me, is a mix of ""hey! nice! something different"" with ""aw men! don't leave me like that!"".

The art is nice, the songs are amazing, the girls are supercool to watch, and our hero, well, he is a misunderstood guy.  And the way the relations grow is funny to watch.  Anyway, if you have read other of my reviews you most know I don't get into details of the series.  If you want something to make you laugh, even if your tastes aren't this, if you want something original, and above all, something which you won't regret spending money, this is it.

Warning! You need to get the OAVS!  Sadly the Perfect Collection version is out of print, and even more sad, this set does not include the ovas.  If you read more reviews you are going to find out that the series real end is the last ova (well, here they are call movies).  A bad trick for Bandai, this should be call THE ALMOST COMPLETE COLLECTION.

The girls, I like the most Kaolla, (she is nuts, she likes Keitaro in a painful sisterly kind of way) and Shinobu (she is cute, and inocent, she brings balance among all those strange not so traditional girls).  Motoko, well, I still don't understand her. Where do she got her hatred for men? Other thing that get tiresome is that she always miread Keitaro actions (she calls him pervert before hitting him), most of the time when he is simply hugging one of the othe girls.  You thing that by the 5th DVD she will get over it and understand that poor Keitaro is simply clumsy, not trying to get into a girls undies, and that is normal for a male friend to hug a female friend (or is she in love with him??).  Kitsune...she doesn't get too much time in the series, but she is fun to watch.  Naru...like Motoko she is always misinterpreting anything Keitaro does.  For this, he gets the reputation of peeping tom among other things.  But, she helps him to study.

Keitaro, well, he is the ""hero"".  He is geeky, nerdy, a nice guy, but since he is clumsy, he gets the fury of Naru fits and Motoko sword.  Part of the comedy is when you see him doing something, and one of these two girls see him and thinks other thing was going on and well, does team rocket mean anything to you?.

Mutsumi, she is not part of the main cast, but she is important, since she is the only one who understand Keitaro.

To end this, Love Hina is a great addition to your collection.  It has an amazing replay value, is fun, is simply amazing.  You won't regret buying this.  And is an anime girls will like too.  The human element is important.  Who doesn't have a dream to fulfill? Who hasn't fallen in love and think is not possible when it is? Who hasn't been in a situation that no matter what you do everyone misunderstands you?  Who didn't want the attention of someone special? Is the human element among the comedy and wierd situations that takes this story to 5 stars. Enjoy it.",1151971200,5,3857,4.257221458046767
2543921,5,B000EXOAFY,"The Love Hina story line is pretty shallow, but no one cares because that's not what the series is about. The plot progression becomes much more obvious towards the end of the series, but the majority of the show's point is comic entertainment. Keitaro Urashima is a second-year ronin (meaning he has failed his college entrance exams twice), and is desperate to get into Tokyo University to fulfilled a childhood promise to a girl he can barely remember.",1150761600,,455,4.846153846153846
2543942,4,B000EXOAFY,"First off let me tell anyone reading this. I've never seen the Anime version of the manga before buying this so it was all new to me.

Seccond as I later found out the series doesn't include portions from the manga which are supposed to be in seprate movies I later learned.

Third this series, not sure if other versions of the Anime are like this, includes two characters I don't remember from the manga and episodes which I cannot remember any manga chapters to back up either. Also differing from the manga is how certain events play out such as when Keitarou and Naru meet Otohime Mutsumi, instead of being on a ship when they accidentitly go on tour together they (Keitarou specifically) bump into her at Tokyo University aka ""Toudai"". Another example being the way Seta was introduced into the story and the following drama with Keitarou and Naru with Keitaro blurting out Naru liking Seta. And many more differnces from the manga, however the basic story plot is still there and for the most part resembles in essence the manga for those of you who like me only read the manga and haven't seen the anime before.

All in all though despite some disappointment with it due to the differences from the manga, which I expected thought not quite so much, it was still funny to watch and good enterainment and worth the money I spent in my opinion. Though heads up, I have yet to watch it in the Japanese language but the English audio of it the characters, are well weird sounding. Example: Mitsune Konno aka ""Kitsune"" reminds me of a cliche old western movie woman's voice. And Keitarou, well I don't know, just weird. They probably could of found better English voice actors is all I'm saying.",1280707200,,1698,4.597359735973598
2543943,5,B000EXOAFY,"I'm a big fan of the series. The only thing I should warn you about this product is that it doesn't have THE last actual episode ""Episode 25:Motoko's Choice, Love or the Sword: Don't Cry"", but I still recomend this for a buy.",1234051200,,225,4.255813953488372
2543944,5,B000EXOAFY,"In print Anime/Manga comes in so many forms, but usually in the world of Television/Movies there are two disticnt types. The world of Giant Robots, Gaming Monsters, Vampires Etc. Then there is the world of Comedy, sometimes it contains a Sci-Fi twist. When it doesn't you have a great show like ""Love Hina""

This is the story of Kaitaro Urashima. He is an 18 year old failure and never seems to have anything good happen to him. All these years he has been keeping a very important promise to a very important girl. He has to go to Tokyo University meet the girl there and lived hapily ever after. There is a major catch...he has no idea who the girl is anymore! So after failing again and again he somehow ends up becoming the manager of his Grandmothers all girl dormatory. There he meets his renters. Kasune a flirtatious girl in her prime. Shinobu, a shy girl but an artist in the kitchen. Motoko, a teenaged amazonian/samurai wannabe with a full on girl power attitude. Su, a wacky inventor who acts like she has had way too much sugar. Then there is the studious and stunning Naru, who Kaitaro creates a real love/hate bond with. She wants to help him get into Tokyo U, but at the same time he is trying to forget the girl he has made the promise to because he might just be falling for Naru.

This is a very enjoyable show one of the best comedies that Anime has to offer. It may not have all the flashy fights and guns, but it does have alot of fists thrown when Kaitaro ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time (It happens often) While the story is very simple the characters are very comlex and relatable. They go through the exact same things we do everyday as high school and college students. Well....not all of them do, but you will figure out who does. There are a lot of other pluses to this show. Other side characters, an incredible soundtrack and the premise would even tempt your girlfriend/boyfriend to watch an episode or two...or more.",1217635200,,1962,4.43213296398892
2543945,5,B000EXOAFY,"I mean you don't even need to read any of these reviews.  Seriously.
This has to be one of my personel favorites of all time.  I can watch it over and over again.

The story is about a nerd who just failed to get into Tokyo-U (basically Harvard and such) for the third time and is kicked out of his house.  With nowhere to go he heads to his grandma's hotel.  This is of course where the story goes nut's.  The place has been turned into a an all girls dorm and he has become the manager.  Not only does he have to try to get into school for a fourth time he has to keep up with the insane residents that reside in the Hina House.

After watching this you'll probably be pissed at the end.  Not to worry.  The story continues and end's in Love Hina Again.  Buy this also along with the movies.

You need to buy these now.  Don't even read the rest of this review.  You won't miss anything I'm just going to go over here and wait. (...............................wistle............................what's this on my shoe........................man I'm hungry..........................mmmmmmmmmmm pizza............)

If your still reading this there is something wrong with you. Buy this I guaranty you'll love it. (if you don't burn your eyes out)

2543946,5,B000EXOAFY,Simply put-this series is a total blast! It does have it's weak moments but on the whole it's well done. I've read the manga and the anime is better by quite a bit. Love Hina Again is the weakest of the movies but is still quite good.,1198281600,,234,4.0
2543947,3,B000EXOAFY,"I was disappointed with the DVD set. I had read the entire manga series before purchasing and I wanted to see how well they did. If you're familiar with FruBa, you know how true-to-the-manga the show was. It's just not so with Love Hina. I was disappointed with the dubbing, disappointed with the way some things happened. I wound up not even watching the whole series.

The DVD is good quality and I still love some of the characters, but I wouldn't recommend this DVD set to anyone who loved the manga and doesn't want to see it changed.",1188345600,,539,4.444444444444445
2543948,5,B000EXOAFY,"It all starts when Keitaro Urashima's grandmother (who is a manager for a women's apartment building) decides to go off and see the world.  Keitaro becomes manager and that's where it all starts...and boy, it gets good after that...

A great story which ends the series by the three movies (Christmas, Spring and Love Hina Again).  The Christmas movie contains the hidden 25th episode which is great.

If you're like me and are into Anime big time, a great series for you to check out!",1182902400,,485,4.670588235294118
2543949,3,B000EXOAFY,"If you want to collect all of Love Hina on DVD you'll need to get both this set and the ""Movie Collection"" which is also available on Amazon.  However, some time ago there was a ""Perfect Collection"" available.  This 10 disk set had all the episodes and all the movies.  It was about $100, which is about the same you'll pay if you get both this set and the movie set.  But still, having it all in one box set is more ""shelf friendly.""  I don't see why the better set has to be no longer available.

That's the reason for the cost of one star in this review.  The other lost star comes due to the anime itself.  Simply put, the manga is much better.  The series, including the movies not included here, does not cover the entire story, and what is covered is done so in a simplified way.  In addition there are some added characters that are rather unnecessary.  The art in the anime is inferior to the manga, except for the final movie ""Love Hina Again"" which isn't even a part of this set.  I didn't hate the anime, and I'm glad to own it.  But I get much more enjoyment from reading the manga.",1178409600,4,1095,4.181818181818182
2543950,5,B000EXOAFY,"I have to admit that I was skeptical about an animated romantic comedy series, seeing as how I seldom enjoy live-action romantic comedies. Still, after having this series recommended to me over and over again I decided to check it out. I was very pleasantly suprised. This is simply animated entertainment at it's finest; great characters, engrossing storyline, hilarious slapstick comedy, over-the-top satire, and some of the most beautiful character designs I've ever seen make this series a no-brainer for all anime fans, and a great introduction to the art form for anime newcomers. Think of this series as Japan's insane answer to shows like ""Friends"". The story revolves around a young man, Keitaro, who becomes the manager of an all-girl apartment complex, Hinata, while working to be accepted to Tokyo University. You see, as a small child he made a promise to a girl he loved and was forced to move away from that when they were older, they would meet as students at Tokyo U and live happily ever after. Sure, he doesn't even remember who the girl is, but Keitaro obviously believes fate will guide him. Also living in Hinata is a wacky cast of female characters; Naru, the object of Keitaro's affection who sports a mean temper and is also working to get into Tokyo U (hmmm...), Su is the lunatic genius of the bunch who is very reminiscent of Ed from Cowboy Bebop, Kitsume is the drunken meddler who views the many conflicts and dramas of the series as her own entertainment, Shinobu is the painfully shy junior high student who comes to stay at the Hianta apartments when her parents get a divorce, and Motoka is a turtle-phobic feminist samurai girl who doesn't take kindly to a male managing an all-girl apartment complex. Plenty more memorable and (dare I say it?) loveable characters make their mark as the series progresses and the interpersonal dynamics between them never fail to produce hilarious and often touching results. Keitaro's endeering geekiness as he pursues Naru, Naru sending Keitaro flying with punch after punch, Motoko chasing him with a sword after she catches him apparently peeping, Shinobu's awkwardness with the whole situation, Su bouncing off the walls and building engines of destruction, Kitsune laying back with a drink in her hand and a big smile on her face as she watches it all go down, great, great stuff. Love Hina has really turned the whole romance-as-comedy genre on it's ear like Ranma 1/2 did back in the day and just went one step further by making the show more believable and emotional, but at the same time amping up the comedy to the ridiculous levels usually associated with shows like Excel Saga. How they managed to pull this off is beyond me. They even threw in some genius homages/spoofs to such classic films as Lady Snowblood, Mothra, Godzilla, Ultraman, fantasy RPG's in general, and much more. There's even an episode featuring Naru spoofing the whole Japanese pop-star/singer/voice-actress phenomenon which I can't help but see as a jab at the ubiquitous Megumi Hayashibara who has a bit part in the series as Keitaro's aunt Haruka (she also sings the series' theme song) and her anime actress/pop-singer ilk. True anime fans will love this stuff. All in all, you get the original 24 episodes of the television series, but this collection skips the bonus 25th episode (my favorite), the Christmas and Spring movies, and the series finale 3-episode OVA which brings the series to a very satifying close.  This is stuff you WILL miss once you've seen the series so I suggest you buy the ""Perfect Collection"" which includes the entire set. But as far as the show itself goes: you just can't beat this series, in one form or another buy it now.",1177545600,9,3711,4.853312302839116
2543951,5,B000EXOAFY,"What can I say that others haven't already. This is one of the best anime i've seen and I am one who tends to not like much of them. But this series is different. For once instead of some insane story which makes about as much sense as a monkey wearing a tutu, Love Hina is actually quite good. There are elements in this that you see in other anime like robots and some zany mystical moments but these are so few that they do not take away from the story. I personally was getting tired of all the same basic stuff over and over again. Either its robots or some mystical theme is about all i've ever seen and it got tiring.

So for you anime and non anime fans, I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. One note however is I would recommend this series for 16+ ages. Theres no nudity but theres plenty of risky scenes and accidental touching of sensitive areas. It is kinda integral to the plot but not near as bad as most of us see on network TV nowadays. Really, watch 10 minutes of WWE wrestling and you'll see content much worse than Love Hina.

For those considering this for purchase, I have a tip for you so you won't get taken by some cheap pirated version. Its simple really. Any Love Hina DVD box that the seller says is an Import edition, is actually selling a pirated version. I had to research this on my own but what they actually do is decrease the episode quality and squeeze more on to fewer discs. So this Legends set with 6 discs you will sometimes see others selling with 3-4 discs. Same is with the Perfect edition which officially has 9 discs but import versions come with about half. Also look for the region code. Many of the pirated versions are region free coded while the official ones are region 1.

If you have any doubts, buy with confidence from Amazon direct. Always a pleasure to deal with.",1174176000,,1822,4.244956772334294
8115456,3,B000EXOAFY,"I remember liking this and made an impulsive purchase. I had watched it when it was English subs and thought it to be way better than the English dubs to be honest. The English voice-actors voices themselves are so much more grating on my nerves than I like and I couldn't make it past the first episode. I'm holding onto it just in case I feel like watching it, but ultimately I probably sell this one to my local book store just to get it off my hands. Typical harem-style anime with crazy adventures and nose-bleeds. I know the story, I'm just trying to be nostalgic but their voices really are agitating beyond belief from what I remember.",1462147200,,643,4.4576271186440675

The characters are lovable, interesting and full of surprises which make you wonder what will happen next. The plot  from one episode to the next can be completely random. Similar to Cowboy Bebop where each episode might not necessarily be tied to the one before. Later in the series the episodes converge together into the final story arc. It is a fun watch.",1386720000,,471,4.541176470588235

Luckily he gets accepted to a prep school and his grandma invites him to stay at the dormitory she runs. When he gets there he realizes that it's an all girls dorm. Keitaro ends up being the manager of the dorm and falls in love with Naru, one of the tenants.

This anime is really fun. There is more comedy than you could hope for. Even though this anime is very silly, there is a very cute love story going on at the same time. The animation and the voice acting are both well done. There are also lots of great characters. The characters are all very unique and keep you wanting to watch more. I can see someone not liking Love Hina though. If you're looking to watch something serious and dramatic then Love Hina may not be for you; but if you want to escape from the drab day to day routine and laugh and have fun, then Love Hina will make your day.",1350777600,,1012,4.137055837563452
8115462,5,B000EXOAFY,"I knew Love Hina by reputation (it is quite old now, having being made in 1999!) but had never got round to watching it until recently. I loved Negima!, also by Ken Akamatsu, so I thought I should give it a look. Am I glad I did; it is BRILLIANT! It is heart-warming, funny, bonkers, cute and lovable all at once!

The story revolves around Keitaro Urashima, a 20-year-old student, who moves to Hinata Hot Springs to hopefully get into the nearby Tokyo University; his grandmother owns an apartment complex there, where he used to stay as a child. She plans to travel the world, and leaves Keitaro to run the place as manager, whilst he continues his studies. Alas, she omitted to tell him this last point, and also that the apartments are now all occupied by gorgeous young women, who initially don't like the idea of a male manager at all! Comic mayhem ensues, with Keitaro regularly being beaten to a pulp by one or other of the girls, for accidentally walking in on them in a state of undress, or landing on them having tripped or slipped, and ending up in a compromising position! They all came to think of him as a pervert and a peeping-tom, but actually he is just clumsy and accident prone!

The main female lead, the beautiful, smart Naru Narusegawa, initially can't stand him, but starts to warm to him after a while. It is usually her famed 'Naru Kick' or 'Naru Punch' that is the means by which she punishes his presumed 'perversion'; he usually ends up in earth orbit or buried deep in a wall having been on the receiving end of her fury! The bulk of the rest of the story follows their blossoming relationship, and its' ups and downs.

The cutest, most lovable character is Shinobu Maehara, a junior high student of maybe 13 or 14 years of age, who lives at the Hinata apartments after her parents divorce. She is shy, bashful (especially around Keitaro, with whom she is in love!), mega-cute, vulnerable and so lovable at times you just want to go 'Awww!' and give her a big hug!

Then there is raunchy, mischievous Mitsune ""Kitsune"" Konno; she is older than the others, at about 19, speaks with a Southern Belle accent (in the English dub) and likes her booze! She never seems to do much work (although she is supposed to be a freelance copy writer), and enjoys winding Keitaro up by grabbing him and burying his head in her ample bosoms; this usually results in Naru battering him for being a 'pervert'!

Other notable characters are Kaolla Su, a hyper-active, dark-skinned beauty of about Shinobu's age (they attend the same school class) who is always inventing gadgets, and is often seen hanging from the rafters, or around the necks of the other characters; she is totally unstoppable, and giggles all the time.

Then comes the quiet Motoko Aoyama, about 16 years of age, who dresses in Samurai costume (apart from at school), and carries a fearsome 'katana' sword, which she knows how to use; she even cuts cars in half with it! She is also beautiful, but hates men, and feels she is a failure as a woman, if not as a warrior!

Mutsumi Otohime is the other girl who has designs on Keitaro, whom she has known since childhood; she is also trying to get into Tokyo U, along with Keitaro and Naru. She is quieter than Naru, and a bit more subtle, but she is almost as accident-prone as Keitaro!

Lastly, there is Keitaro's older cousin, Haruka Urashima, now in her 30's, who smokes a lot, and whom he sometimes calls 'Aunt Haruka' (which was what he called her as a child); this usually results in Keitaro finding himself on the receiving end of a ferocious punch, usually followed by the terse statement 'It's just Haruka!' from her. She runs the cafe/restaurant in the complex, and mostly wears an apron over her clothes.

There is little in the way of fan-service; usually the only underwear shots are on the washing line (although the OVA's do have a few more panty-shots and up-skirt views, but not too many)! The animation is good, although showing its age a little, but the story and the interrelationships of the characters more than make up for it; it is great fun, totally lovable, and definitely not to be missed!",1336867200,,4143,4.57277628032345

This is one of those love sick stories we all can't get enough of and it will leave you wanting more, or at least to get the book series to find out how everything ends. This is a non stop laughing fest, with a few serious moments that get laughter again. This is also one of the few series that you will never get tired of watching over again and again. It is also not so complicated that at the end of the day you are left wondering what the heck just happen. If you are starting to get into anime, or a long time watcher, I'd highly recommend this be added to your collection.",1299110400,,627,4.105691056910569
