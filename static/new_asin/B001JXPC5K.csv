3662252,5,B001JXPC5K,Love Red Green and have watched them numerous times already. Will be buying more seasons as we can. funny as ever.,1358208000,,114,4.476190476190476
3662253,5,B001JXPC5K,Love these guys would love to get all of the shows but I don't know how many they have out there. You will die of laughter watching these. Best bunch of guys I know.,1299628800,,165,3.8823529411764706
3662254,5,B001JXPC5K,"Season 10 is the one that really renewed the show, Patrick McKenna took off to do some other things, and that gave a chance for the other guys to get more involved.  When McKenna returned in Season 11, the balance of the show changed, his character Harold naturally is the looniest of the bunch.  Still, Winston, Dalton, and particularly Mike remain established as central characters, and the last seasons from this point out are really the best, an ensemble cast who know each others' timing instinctively.

Don't expect anything great here, if you don't know the show, the very mild and cheesy humor is part of the charm, it's really sappy stuff out of context.  But, that's not likely, pretty much anyone buying this DVD already has seen these episodes multiple times, and for those people these bits fit like an old coat.  So why I am going on about this?  You already know.  Excuse me, I gotta run, it's 10PM and the show is on.  Again.

PS: The Azon preview section is totally off, the first episode was #211, when Harold comes back.",1277337600,,1039,4.603260869565218
3662255,5,B001JXPC5K,"Without going into specifics every episode of this season and every other season has been and always been fantantisc! What I am wondering is when are seasons 2002, 2003, 2004, etc going to come out? As a huge fan I can't just have part of the series - I want the whole thing. By all means though this is worth your money - every penny!",1273017600,,335,4.1692307692307695
3662256,5,B001JXPC5K,"If you're a Red Green fan this is the season where Harold returns to the show, and that's a plus.  A great diversion from the complications of reality.  The entire series is an irreverent look at the modern man.  Funny, and insightful at the same time.  Easily the funniest thing from Canada I've seen.  You can't go wrong with Red!",1241049600,3,332,4.466666666666667
3662257,5,B001JXPC5K,"The Red Green show had been going for many years at this point, but was not getting tired. It was amazing how the writing held up over the years. Great show, great season. I miss you Red. Keep giving us DVDs!",1237852800,,208,4.097560975609756
