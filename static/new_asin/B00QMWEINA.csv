6877165,5,B00QMWEINA,I saw both movies individually when they were released to the theaters. I enjoyed both which is unusual. Gena Rowland's Gloria is one tough broad who doesn't take crap from anyone. You do get rare glimpses of her feelings for the kid. Sharon Stone's Gloria is just as tough but she shows great tenderness for the kid. I'm not that big of a Sharon Stone fan. I admit that she has done some pretty good movies but I don't think that she ever reached super stardom but in this one she was right on the money and I did enjoy watching her in this movie. The price on this double feature was fantastic.,1428105600,3,596,4.283185840707965

6877167,4,B00QMWEINA,Both versions of this movie are good.  The Gena Rowland's version is a much better film.  Is a good study.  Recommended.,1426204800,5,120,4.619047619047619
6877168,5,B00QMWEINA,"I personally prefer Sharon Stone's Gloria. I think it is an excellent movie, and Sharon Stone has done a great job here. I don't know if she was recognized for this brilliant portrayal or not, and I think it is not important either;  but I found her performance superb. And the script is taut, the direction is excellent, and keeps the viewer's interest to the end. Over-all, a must watch movie.",1424995200,4,395,4.563380281690141
8692089,5,B00QMWEINA,Sharon Stone was awesome. If I had seen the first  one with Gena Rowlands I would have really missed out. It is rare for the remake to be better but it is much better.,1521072000,,167,3.911764705882353
8692090,5,B00QMWEINA,Two Glorias in one. Both are very good. You can  watch them over and over and never get bored. Gena Rowlands was a tough chick with the heart of gold. Bottom line...Great Movie!,1494806400,,177,4.363636363636363
