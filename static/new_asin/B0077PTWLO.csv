5062304,4,B0077PTWLO,"Unless you are an avid sci-fi/horror fan, skip the first two films and go directly to Mimic 3 Sentinel, wherein director JT Petty slowly builds from setting up the plot to a logical, terrific, and terrifying ending.  The content occupies 72 minutes; there is no padding in this film, unlike the first two.  The set up is very similar to that of Rear Window, a handicapped voyeur spying on his neighbors, using a telephoto camera.  The DIRECTOR's camera is usually objective, and sometimes omniscient, and at the very end subjective--where the protagonist is either in a curtained hospital bed--or who knows where?  This direct-to-video gem was made for a third of the budget of the original Mimic, whose domestic gross did not exceed its budget.
  Director del Toro (original Mimic, at a long 105 minutes) was unhappy with this film as released--I can see why. It builds up a little suspense, then fails to capitalize on it, then builds a little suspense, and so the cycle keeps repeating itself.  The ending, meant to be uplifting, I guess, is extremely unlikely, and may have been tacked on by the studio.  This version of the film is NOT the director's cut, but I don't see how six additional minutes can make up for the sloppy pacing.
  Mimic 2 never gets off the ground.  Even the special effects are not up to par.  A waste of time at 82 minutes.
  I give the set 4 stars because the low prices justifies Mimic 3 Sentinel.",1347321600,,1428,4.637450199203188
5062305,4,B0077PTWLO,"Mimic Released in 97 - I saw Mimic when first released on Video & again together with Mimic 2 and 3 some time later on DVD and now again on Blu Ray : Mimic 3 Film Set directed by Guillermo Del Toro is the story about an epidemic infestation threatening the lives of children spread by cockroaches beneath the city of Manhattan and so out of desperation entomologist Susan Tylor ( Mira Sorvino ) is brought in by CDC together with Peter Mann later to be her husband ( Jeremy Northam ) and genetically engineer another bug called the Judas Breed that will kill the original cockroaches spreading the desease and the story than jumps 3 years later and their experimental bug killer unexpectadly resurfaces as a giant bug next to the original size cockroach and things intensefy when Peter explores the subway tunnel with police officer Leonard ( Charles S . Dutton ) and discovers Susan ( M. Sorvino ) & a lost boy Chuy ( Alexander Goodwin ) and worried father Manny ( Giancarlo Giannini )looking for he's son who's autistic also starring F Murray Abraham as Susan's proffesor and Josh Brolin as Peter Mann's ( J . Northam ) assistant . This is an unrated horror with action suspense explosions towards the end and the only negative thing I can say about this movie some scenes in the subway are a bit dark than again is supposed be dark in the subway , with : English DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 & 5.1 and special feautures , I'm not so much into horror movies but make an exception for some like Mimic ... Five .

Mimic 2 Released 2001 R rated - The Hard Shell takes up a couple of years from the original Mimic means thousands of generations for the Judas Breed and the genetecally altered species near humanoid proportions right down to wearing life like masks by ripping the faces of their victims and government agent lead by Edward Albert participate in exterminating the giant killer cockroaches by fumigation with Alix Koromzay who played as Mira Sorvino's co worker in the first Mimic returns as the single science teacher in an inner city high school where is discovered the bugs have established a new hive with Jon Polito playing as the principal and after a few murdered man are linked to the entomologist Detective Klaski ( Bruno Campos ) investigated and meets up with the science teacher , not a bad picture story and sound and  a B Grade Movie so rate this a 3 .

Mimic 3 Released 2003 R rated - Sentinel takes up the next step about young man Marvin( Karl Geary ) who's hypersensitive to germs and confined to his room spends most of his days taking photos of neighbors and everyone on the streets & sister ( Alexis Disiena ) with a drug problem & controlling mother Amanda Plummer who's having a love affair with detective ( John Kapelos )and things go wrong when the 2 witness a murder committed by one of the giant killer bugs and after sometime the young mans sister and neighbor Carmen ( Rebecca Mardem ) decide top assist in Marvin's suspicions by snooping around other peples homes leading to the streets and having a showdown with the bugs and than moving up to Marvins appartment with appearance by Lance Henriksen wanting to keep one of the bugs in a small  case , another B grader , worse than the second 2 & half .

 Good value for three Blu Ray movies and the original by Guillermo Del Toro still the Best ... four and a half .",1346889600,,3352,4.460032626427406
5062306,5,B0077PTWLO,mimic 3 film set is well worth the money all 3 movies are great they are really good sifi movies they really look and sound great in blueray .,1341792000,,142,3.9310344827586206
5062307,5,B0077PTWLO,"This type of set needed to be done for many movie series. The blu ray mastering is very close to what they shot. Film grain shows up because that's what you would expect. Mira sorvino is at her peak here and she just never got a chance to shine much later on sadly. All three were low budget movies but you get the directors cut here too on the first movie. Which is more than the canadian release had. The other two were made to dvd movies and were not as good but in spite of that the third one is quite interesting , the second one is more average but none of the flicks here are awful in the least. This deserves five stars for the fact that they gave the whole series at a good price and that they did a good job of mastering the movies. there are no extras on the last two movies. This is how the species and tremors series could have been handled as well. So you get no complaints from me. Some people who don't like sci fi might not give this set a chance. But even the cheapest movie here is pretty advanced to what alot of low budget movies are like from the period.  the first one though is a much higher quality as you would expect. As these series go on they usually don't get better. But here is the whole trilogy on blu ray for a good price even. The picture quality is excellent too on all three movies.",1337299200,7,1319,4.053639846743295
5062308,4,B0077PTWLO,"Finally they put them all together, which makes it sooo much more easier! I already had the first one but the second and third never seemed available so I was excited to see this in the stores.

The first and second were great but the third I thought was a bore, they should have stopped it at the second one. I felt like they just made that one and put the name on it for the money and no one seemed into it even the actors. The acting was pretty horrible in my opinion and they didn't seem to have much depth to them.  There didn't seem to be much of any depth anywhere in the last one.....

SO, Rating for putting them all together (5/5). Mimic (5/5). Mimic 2 (5/5). Mimic 3 (1/5)
Equals out to 4/5 stars in my eyes!",1336089600,2,719,4.049295774647887
5062309,4,B0077PTWLO,"Lionsgate, you've won douche bag of the year award for making the most shameless Blu-ray forced advertisement release. I literally thought there was something wrong with the first movie disc since I couldn't find THE MOVIE, I stopped it twice to see what the hell was going on and restarted it only to realize that it wasn't the typical 2 movie trailers I had to skip over, it took 14 button presses of the NEXT button on my remote to get to the main menu and you can't bypass it. YES, FOURTEEN presses...

I haven't seen one of these movies so this is a cool package, it's just that Lionsgate is beyond insulting, usually if you buy a deluxe type of set, or bundled set like this you get cool extras, not trailers that require 14 clicks to even get to the movie.

ANYWAY, that's my only gripe... I can't recall if I'd seen Mimic 2, and after just having watched it I can see why... it's quite forgettable. The third movie is probably the best, despite it borrowing Hitchcock's Rear Window concept it's a great film and utilizing that Hitchcock theme of voyeuristic suspense lends itself well to the Mimic storyline. All three movies are decent HD transfers although some scenes are grainy like many other movies, low light scenes seem to suffer the migration to HD? After you get over the ridiculous trailers that never seem to end, I really like the format of the main menu for the second disc which contains Mimic 2 and Mimic 3, you can swap movies via the PLAY menu and I like the way the movie is still playing in a shrunken window when jumping scenes etc... nothing to fancy but stylish and functional. There are little extras but I find this little set quite enjoyable and worth the money, it's a good deal even though Mimic 2 is pretty sad viewing. Mimic 1 and 3 are great quality horror/sci-fi films while Mimic 2 is an average B movie grade flick. In the end I find Mimic 3 the most stylish and moody of the 3 movies, great music score, decent acting and cool little plot... I did laugh at the way they used the young girl as a blatant lolita tease in the first few scenes of the movie prior to her drug dealer boyfriends death.",1336003200,25,2138,4.396464646464646
5062310,3,B0077PTWLO,"While not quite a fair review of the blu-ray of the series, I have watched all three movies and while the first one is one of my all-time favorite movies, the second and third were just awful. Unless you're a fan of really bad, and I mean not so bad they're funny, but so bad they're just a waste of time, just get the first movie by itself. I'd give the first movie five stars, but the second and third get one star each, thus a total of a 3 star rating. I can't stress enough to just get the original movie only, I don't know why they thought this release was such a great idea.",1335830400,3,580,4.008620689655173

5062332,4,B0077PTWLO,"The first Mimic movie released in 1997 was the first major film in American cinema by Mexican director and screenwriter Guillermo del Toro.  His earlier work, Cronos, is almost unknown outside of horror movie buffs.  But this film established del Toro as a great director in both the horror and science fiction genres.  Set in modern-day New York City, the movie's plot starts with a plague that afflicts primarily children, with which the authorities combat with some genetic engineering and bio-warfare.  This biological warfare leads to some horrific consequences, specifically a breed of cockroach that grows to human size, and preys on humans.  The two sequels, Mimic 2 and 3 follow up on this, and take place several years after the events of the first movie.

The first Mimic movie comes in both theatrical and extended editions; both on one disc.  The second disc contains Mimic 2 and 3, both of which only have theatrical versions.  The first movie is a good blend of horror, suspense, and science-fiction.  Mimic 2 is cheesy and ridiculous, and by far the worst of the three.  Mimic 3 somewhat redeems the failures of the 2nd movie, and has some dark comedy and campiness mixed in.

The special effects, visual and audio, are great in all three movies.  And the visual quality of the movies on Blu-Ray is impeccable.  There is a minimal of special features, so don't expect hours of extra stuff on either disc.  For the price however, this is a bargain.",1451952000,3,1463,4.823293172690763

earth if we destroy humanity in nuclear warfare, the fact that they could mimic their predator and live in our midst is not that far of a stretch.

Mimic is a near classic, when I first saw it I had no knowledge of the movie and having missed it in theatres which is quite rare these days. So it was quite a surprise when I found it to be an interesting take on an old story. Some wonderful use of sound, light and shadows which shroud the boogieman until it needed to be revealed.

Mimic 2: The ugly step cousin of the bunch. The story could have been creepy if it weren't so laughable to begin with. Still, it does merit a watch only if you want to see how the series tries to branch out in different directions with the same story elements.

Mimic 3: The Sentinel: I gotta admit, this one was rather shy and not quite flashy. Still the story is interesting enough to keep you interested towards the end.

5062394,4,B0077PTWLO,"Mimic is a near classic, as when I first saw it I had no knowledge of the movie and having missed it in theatres which is quite rare these days. So it was quite a surprise when I found it to being an interesting take on an old story. Some wonderful use of sound, light and shadows which shroud the boogieman until it needed to be revealed. Blu-ray looks alright although I am by no means an expert.

Mimic 2: The ugly step cousin of the bunch. The story could have been creepy if it weren't so laughable to begin with. Still, it does merit a watch only if you want to see how the series tries to branch out in different directions with the same story elements.

Mimic 3: The Sentinel: I gotta admit, this one was rather shy and not quite flashy. Still the story is interesting enough to keep you interested towards the end. Some might argue about a similar fridge moment at the conclusion of the film, although it wasn't nuked. :D",1368489600,,930,4.278409090909091

5062396,5,B0077PTWLO,Better to give the highest praises for this quality selection so reasonably priced than not I think. And as Science Fiction is one of my passions persistently pursued. I am pleased and proud to give proper credit to Amazon.com for making it a possible for me to purchase it. Merry Christmas and Season Greetings!,1356307200,3,312,4.796296296296297
5062397,3,B0077PTWLO,"While my expectations for the treatment of the second two films in the Mimic trilogy were not particularly high, it was my hope that, in the 13 years since its initial release on DVD and 14 since its theatrical inception, the original Mimic would finally at least be given an anamorphic transfer to appease my upscaling DVD player and ensure that watching the film without windowboxing (black bars on all four sides) would be a possibility, but this was apparently not a consideration. As a result, the set is no more impressive than the initial DVD release of each individually with no additional features to speak of. Any hardcore adherent of the trilogy will likely be appeased with all films in one inexpensive set, but the DVD aficionado will remain wanting for something worth owning not on DVD. Overall, extremely unimpressive.",1352246400,2,834,4.921985815602837

8511990,1,B0077PTWLO,"After the original picture, which was very well done and had excellent special effects and very good acting, the following two are real stinkers.  Apparently done with a non-existent budget (they are shot almost entirely on one set, a room or a building) using close ups.  The acting is atrocious and the script written by and for morons.  The special effects amount to costumes with moving parts including head masks like the kind used in New Orleans during mardi-gras.  The only thing good I can say about this ""collection"" is it includes the directors cut of the original Mimic in Blu ray and for the price it makes it a good deal.  So buy the trilogy and toss the disc with the second and third movies and enjoy the four star original..",1508544000,3,740,4.575757575757576
