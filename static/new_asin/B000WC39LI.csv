2966954,1,B000WC39LI,"Seriously, these suck sooo bad that they are not even American Pie movies! These are just cheap rip-offs to cash-in on a franchise. They are just the same plot about going to college, getting laid, getting drunk, etc. The only thing they do to make it like the originals is get Eugene Levy to be Jim's dad for a 5 minute cameo. I would not recommend AMERICAN PIE PRESENTS: THE TRIPLE PACK!!!",1228435200,3,391,4.444444444444445
2966955,1,B000WC39LI,"Although this is a good deal for 3 DVDs, the three DVDs you get are nothing but garbage. The original trilogy incorporated humor and sex, but it also included good lessons(kind of) about high-school and post-high-school relationships. In these movies, no lessons are learned by anyone. If i wanted to see a bunch of naked girls with no plot line, there are millions of websites to see that, so these movies are crap. After Erik and Tracy supposedly fall in love at the end of the naked mile, she runs away with Trent in beta house. It just doesn't make any sense. Erik's ejaculation problems are the poor man's version of Jim's in the original series. Though these pies are baked by the same company as the originals, they are stale and don't even deserve to be violated by Jim.",1207267200,4,778,4.564285714285714

Those movies also had some nudity (mostly) for comedic effect. In contrast, these spiritual sequels have nudity with a plotline (mostly) for comedic effect. With plot holes  so big you can drive a truck through them and incredibly unfunny , it is obvious why the three last movies were released straight to DVDs.

When rating a product, I don't normally assign a grade based only on the movie itself. That is what movies reviews are for. For a rating, I'll look at things like extras, DVD packaging, features, etc. This DVD set is very rich in those areas; the problem is that the movies that these extras pertain to are horrible and borderline retarded.

My biggest frustration is that they have the American Pie banner, which led me to believe these movies would be on par with the originals. Totally devoid of charisma, there's no real reason to buy this set unless you are into bad movies. Although admittedly each movie has the occasional funny moments, sitting through ninety minutes of crap for two jokes is not worth your time or money.",1282176000,,1386,5.681159420289855
