8084432,2,B000BBBH5A,"What can I say? Husband treats wife horribly and wants out of marriage. Husband cheats on wife. Wife cheats with pool boy. Pool boy cheats with teeny bobber friend. Wife gets psycho obsessive over pool boy and kidnaps teeny-bopper. Everyone lives unhappily ever after.
Jan-Michael Vincent does his usual sub-standard acting job.
Myndi Miller plays a fine sex starved psycho.
Linnea Quiggly is her usual, vapid, stereo-typed, sexy teenager role.
I hope Ken Abraham's acting got better the more jobs he got (if any).
Let the buyer beware on this one.",1195776000,,548,5.032967032967033
