7834219,5,6303018114,"Story line: An accountant beleaguered by personal and professional problems (Harry Hamlin) gets involved with a femme fatale (Lysette Anthony) and her mysterious psychiatrist... Expertly cast, well directed (Alan Roberts) and a solid script made for a plausible story line and enjoyable watching... The chemistry between Jim Stevens (Hamlin) and Ellie (Anthony) was genuine with Anthony stealing almost every scene with her bountiful and abundant English rose loveliness, some sans clothing... For erotic thriller fans, a movie well worth a second viewing and part of my personal library because of that.",1464566400,3,604,5.648351648351649

I'm British!"" and she says, putting her hands on her breasts and thrusting them toward him, ""But so are these!"" In this movie you get to see ""these"" several times, but that's about all that can be said for it. Predictable story, predictable ending, Lysette, the end.",1329436800,,407,4.666666666666667
