3496658,5,B001BP14SU,Sasuke wants more power only to seek revenge against his brother who killed everyone in his village  Its sad to see him leave the leaf village but he decides to all on his own  And fights Naruto because he just wants to...  Just to see what strength he has?  I am glad he feels its not necessary to try to kill Naruto to gain more power like his older brother did...  It shows he seeks his own path...  So good to watch thanks Pam :),1227830400,,433,4.035294117647059
3496659,5,B001BP14SU,This really brings a major story arc to a amazing conclusion. The animation in the fight between Naruto and Sasuke reached feature film levels. To me this ends the Naruto series and it doesn't start up again until he comes back to the village older. The filler episodes that take place after this are ok but not necessary to what goes on in the manga.,1227052800,,351,4.415384615384616
3496660,4,B001BP14SU,Anyone who like Naruto will enjoy these episodes.  It's where Naruto and friends try to get Sakuke back.  I especially enjoyed Rock Lee being unknowningly drunk.,1226793600,,161,5.153846153846154
3496661,5,B001BP14SU,"A must have for all Naruto fans. The season ends with an epic battle that gives fans a glimpse of the awesome power within Naruto, as well as within Sasuke. You have to see it to believe it!",1226793600,,190,4.026315789473684
3496662,5,B001BP14SU,"Just awesome, the return of Rock Lee, the sand village joining forces  with Konoha and the awaited combat between Naruto and Sasuke !",1226361600,,133,4.782608695652174
3496663,5,B001BP14SU,"The reviews so far state everything that needs to be stated. This is a highly enjoyable series. The only thing I want to say is; after Box set 10 starts the dreaded year and a half long 'filler arc'.

  Due to the popularity of the series the anime actually caught up to the manga. Meaning there was no new storyline to animate. To remedy this they started, seemingly, making up story lines to fill a gap so Kishimoto, Naruto's creator, could write/draw/publish more of the story via the manga. As a result the manga feels rushed at times and the anime had obvious problems. (The poor guy had marriage/family problems because of how much time he had to devote to pumping out this manga.)

  At first it's not so bad as they bring back old characters you probably forgot about and it's the just the animation that is severely lacking. Then as the Fillers continue they make up characters and situations.. Naruto starts using his ultimate attack, rasengan, like it's nothing, the enemies get harder, things stop making sense, and ALL the character progression come to a full screeching halt.

  While there are some interesting storylines in said fillers, namely when they try to track Sauske using a bug and Hinata actually 'levels up'. However, I'm just trying to give all of you fans of the series a heads up if you plan to buy the entire series. After this box set, maybe not the first 3 or 4 episodes of box 11, starts the fillers...and it's a looong poorly animated, mind numbing road. You could effectively stop collecting Naruto at this box and wait for the 'Shippuden' Arc. Even at the 'end' of the fillers there is no closure, it doesn't solve anything, it's quite open-ended, and in my opinion a good waste of money to collect.

  Shippuden picks up 2 and a half years after the last few episodes between box 10 and 11 and actually continues the original storyline. As a matter of fact even Shippuden doesn't show you what happened in the last 2 years except by timely flashacks and some narrative. You're not missing anything after this. Some of the younger crowd won't feel any different watching the filler arc as it at time distracts you buy mentioning 'this is to find Sauske' but as a parent myself I wouldn't purchase this. I can't find the value in it.",1225756800,,2269,4.589108910891089
3496664,5,B001BP14SU,"This DVD is without a doubt a must own for any Naruto fan out there.  This season showcases the best in the show, especially the epic battle between Sasuke and Naruto.  Plus I honestly think they did this thing perfectly by having episode 135 being the final episode on this boxset since it shows the debut of the Akatsuki in full force.  So yeah, def well worth grabbing and after this...dont even worry about buying anymore after this one because of those dang fillers.  Wait up on Shippuden when it comes out.",1223510400,6,512,4.532608695652174
3496665,5,B001BP14SU,"The End of Tears is on this boxed set, and it is by far the best episode in Part I.  The whole Sasuke vs. Naruto battle scene (which takes several episodes) is vitally important to the rest of the story.  These last few episodes have a profound impact on who Naruto & Sasuke become in Part II (Shippuuden).  This set is a MUST HAVE for any Naruto fan.  You can forget about all the filler garbage that comes afterward, though.  I'm holding out for Shippuuden to be dubbed.",1223078400,3,472,4.318181818181818
3496666,5,B001BP14SU,"The 10th uncut box set begins with episode 121.  The Sasuke retrieval team is already engaged in separate and individual combat with the Sound 4.  This is after Choji and Jirobo take each other out, and Kimimaro and Naruto begin battle.  The first episode (121) is the one in which Kiba tries escaping down river with Akamaru.  There aren't any filler episodes in this box set.  This is a trully great part of the Naruto story arc.

The high points (to me) in these episodes are:

Rock Lee reveals that he is a master of the ""Drunken Fist""

Gara finishes off Kimimaro and is more chillingly powerful than in the Chunin exams.

Lots of back story on the Uchiha brothers, Susuke and Itachi.  Very heavy.

Naruto and Sasuke really showcases how powerful each has become while they shred each other.

The final episode (135) has the retrieval team returning to the leaf village and Sasuke joining Orochimaru.  All alive, some gravely injured, and all changed.  Finally, there is a hint at future romance between Shikamaru and Temari (leaf ninja).

3496673,3,B001BP14SU,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 10 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and twenty-one through one hundred and thirty-five of Naruto.  The first disc contains five episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The focus of this box set is the continuation of the Sasuke Retrieval Arc.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview for Naruto Uncut Box Set 11, which runs for roughly three and a half minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and twenty-eight.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, the Naruto manga, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are trailers for Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody, Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, Buso Renkin, the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2 video game, the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm video game, the Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 video game, and the Bleach: Shattered Blade video game.

Even though I've come to expect these special features from the Naruto Uncut box sets, I still find myself wishing that Viz Media would have tried to go to a little more effort to provide a little more variety to the special features.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 10 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1275350400,,1959,4.63768115942029

Boxes 11-16 are ""fillers"" (episodes not contained in the manga). This is a must have for anyone that watched the series since this is when half of the best fights start/finish. If you are new to Naruto, do not watch this until you watch boxsets 1-9 in order or else you will be completely lost since none of these are stand-alone episodes.",1255046400,,507,4.7727272727272725
