2195118,4,B0006TPE4M,"Just as David O. Russell's last film, ""Three Kings,"" was a breakneck rollercoaster ride through the first Persian Gulf War, so his new movie, ""I Heart Huckabees,"" is another rollercoaster ride. But it's a more ambitious ride this time, dipping and swooping through nothing less than the various problems of existence. Trying to describe the plot in detail would spoil the fun (and would also be like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded), so here are the bare bones: Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin are ""existential detectives"" trying to solve the intellectual and emotional crises of four clients: Jason Schwartzman, an angry environmentalist and very bad poet; Mark Wahlberg, an even angrier firefighter and one-man anti-petroleum activist; Jude Law, a shallow, backstabbing junior executive at a WalMart-like superstore, the titular Huckabees; and Naomi Watts, Law's main squeeze and the national spokesmodel for Huckabees, who is starting to rebel against having to be ""beautiful"" all the time. Throwing a monkey wrench in the investigation is Isabelle Huppert, a Parisian existentialist who insists that existence is meaningless, so why search for meaning? There are so many ideas and concepts ping-ponging through this movie that it's just about impossible to catch them all in just one viewing. ""I Heart Huckabees"" has been getting wildly mixed reviews--Ebert & Roeper famously turned Two Thumbs Down--but I liked it a lot. I must admit the film feels somewhat sketchy, but it also feels like a movie that would improve on a second (or third) viewing. It certainly has a lot of buoyant energy, all the discussions of meaninglessness and despair notwithstanding. All the performers are good, and two of them--Wahlberg and Law--are sensational. The verdict: If you liked ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" you'll like ""I Heart Huckabees.""",1098057600,7,1881,5.315436241610739
2195119,5,B0006TPE4M,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, though I could easily imagine while many would not. It follows very much in the footsteps of other major release but out-of-the-mainstream films such as BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, IGGY GOES DOWN, THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS, and ADAPTATION. Anyone who enjoyed all or any of those films is very likely to like this one as well. Anyone who was put off by any or all of those films is unlikely to like I (HEART) HUCKABEES.

I don't want to provide any details about the story, since I believe that this is a film best enjoyed in a state of relative ignorance as to its plotline. Much of the joy in seeing the film for me was in its constantly surprising me with each twist the story took. I loved having no idea whither or where the narrative would lead, or even if it would find resolution in the end. It did, but it might not have been resolved in a fashion that would please every viewer. Without giving away any plot details, I can say that much of has the familiar feel of those undergraduate days spent contemplating existential philosophy. The ghost of Jean-Paul Sartre haunts the script.

As odd as the script is, it is remarkable that the producers were able to attract such an astonishing array of first rate actors. Though a collection of stars, it is in fact a tremendous ensemble cast, and all of the performers apparently content to be part of an interconnected group. Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin (I wonder if anyone else gets the impression that she has been virtually the same age for forty years) play a married couple who are also professional colleagues in a very unusual detective agency. Jason Schwartzman plays a young environmentalist who becomes their client. Jude Law is an executive with the Huckabees of the film's title (and who wears the same medium blue suit throughout the film). Naomi Watts plays his girlfriend (and official voice of Huckabees) and who is astonishingly beautiful throughout the film, whether adorned in clothing that inevitably resembles a bikini or in baggy overalls and Amish bonnet. Mark Wahlberg probably cannot be made less attractive than he is in this film, though it is also one of his more interesting roles, as a fireman who is like Schwartzman a client of Hoffman and Tomlin. The extraordinary Isabelle Huppert, whose appearances in English language films have been tragically rare, provides a Continental presence as the author of a book that Hoffman and Tomlin perceive as threatening to their activities.

Between the highly original and difficult-to-anticipate script, the excellent direction, and the superb ensemble cast, I found this to be an utterly enjoyable film. I hesitate, however, in giving it a blanket recommendation. While I loved its quirkiness, many more conservative filmgoers could find it a bit too adventurous. I repeat what I first said about this film: if you enjoyed the films mentioned in the first paragraph, you are likely to love this one, but if you found this unpleasant or simply too odd, you might want to avoid this one.",1097798400,140,3037,4.825335892514396
2195120,1,B0006TPE4M,"I Heart Huckabees is one of the most inaccessible movies I have ever seen.  It's not funny, witty, intelligent, or really that deep.  Yes, it is different.  If you think that going against the norm is the only thing of any importance in a film, this is for you. Personally, I am looking forward to getting my next filling much more than seeing this movie for the second time.",1097625600,4,375,4.405797101449275
2195121,5,B0006TPE4M,"This film by David Russell strikes a bullseye.  The story of a young activist (Jason Schwartzman) immobilized by an existential dilemma takes us into some dense philosophical territory without losing its pace or its zing as a comedy, surpassing even the powers of the 1970's Woody Allen films.  It is every bit as funny as the funniest of them.

Some critics complain that the movie is overplotted, but it is no more so than the caper comedies or great race movies of the 1960's.  The performances are sharp and perfectly in tune with Russell's zany pace and style: and what a convergence!  Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Naomi Watts, Jude Law (managing an American accent as a corporate frat boy on the rise), Mark Wahlberg in my favorite performance by him yet, and Isabelle Huppert in a rare English-speaking role.

May I also call attention to the score by Jerry Brian, deceptively melancholy while recalling the jazzy soundtracks of Technicolor screwball comedies.",1097625600,4,967,4.975155279503106
2195122,5,B0006TPE4M,"MOVIE: Ever feel like you were a meaningless speck of dirt that had no meaning? Ever wonder what the purpose of life is? This movie is basically about that. What makes it so genius is how absurdly normal the plot is. Albert Morkovski is a striving poet and environmentalist who comes to the Existential Detectives (Dustin Hoffman & Lily Tomlin) to help him explain a coincidence he has had with a tall African man. Instead these ""detectives"" go deep into his life trying to make sense of it all, and at first it makes no sense to the audience. Albert started a coalition to save a nearby marsh from being devolped on. Brad (Jude Law) is the executive salesperson at Huckabees, a large retail store, and he is sponsoring Albert's coalition but ends up taking over it. Albert ends up meeting the very open and free spirit that is Tommy (Mark Wahlberg). The whole movie is about trying to answer the questions that apparently nobody has the answer to, and in doing so the audience gets funny results. This is the most enjoyable comedy of the year, one of the best. Garden State was another favorite of mine but that had a very heavy dramatic aspect to it. This movie has a very light tone, and at points is laugh out loud hilarious. There are no jokes, no physical comedy, because what makes it funny is just these free spirit people trying to find who they really are and what their purposes are. No doubt about it, the movie will confuse you at times, and make you contemplate on human existance. But in the end you will be able to reflect back on it and be able to make more sense of it than you did while watching it. I personally would like to see it again because it's just that type of movie. What a great little exploration into the complexities of humans and the way we think.

ACTING: My favorite in this movie was Mark Wahlberg. He was the funniest guy here, and he played the role so convincingly. Dustin Hoffman was another great stand-out. The rest of the cast were brilliant as well, and they were able to take this golden script and deliver it so amazingly. I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar nomination for acting within this movie.

BOTTOM LINE: One of the greatest surprises of the year. So strange and bizarre that it actually makes sense. You will laugh at this movie because you will see yourself in this movie. You will either connect with Albert or Brad. So quirky, so absurd, so insightful that you'll want to see it again.",1097539200,2,2450,4.466517857142857
2195123,4,B0006TPE4M,"I loved Huckabee's. It is an amusing existentialist romp. And how many times can you use the word ""existentialist"" in relation to a comedy?

Most characters and themes in this convoluted plot mirror  other characters and themes. Albert (Jason Schwartzman), is an earnest do gooder, an environmentalist poet. He wants to save the world from the urban sprawl represented best by the expansion of Huckabee's (think Target or Wal Mart) and impersonated best by their slick executive in charge of communications (JUde Law). Schwartzmann's character is physically and spirtually a mess; Law's glistens with confidence and good looks.

Albert hires two existentialist detectives (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) to get to the root of his angst. Their job is to spy on him at all hours of the day and night. They believe everything is connected, that we are all one. Their arch nemesis Caterine (Isabelle Huppert) believes that nothing is connected, everything is meaningless. And Albert's psyche--and eventually Law's psyche, and his girlfriend's (Naomi Watts), and Albert's friend's (Mark Wahlberg's)--gets deconstructed every which way by these competing forces.

The movie is a romp, a farce. The audience delights in the details of the journey. Along the way, we meet Albert's narcissistic parents, a doorman and his family whom Albert keeps running into, even Shania Twain. The jokes fly freely and base themselves in a wide range of philosophies.

The performances are outstanding. Jude Law continues to amaze me. Here is totally believable as a shiny huckster, a self made guy from Cleveland who just wants to show you his BMW SUV. Mark Wahlberg, as a firefighter so tortured by the idea of the waste of petroleum on this earth that he bicycles to fires, astonished me with his performance. I knew he was a good actor-but great?! He is here.

Certainly this movie is not for everyone. If you like standard comedic fare and dislike such movies as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Mind"" or ""Adaptation"", then you may have a difficult time with Huckabee's.

If however, you like experimentation with comedy, then you may ""heart"" Huckabee's.",1097193600,5,2129,5.118155619596542
2195124,4,B0006TPE4M,"""I Heart Huckabees"" is one of those movies that will make you feel bad if you try to dislike it -- it's such an offbeat, amusing little movie that the incomprehensibility of the plot feel irrelevant. Despite a dose of existentialism and some vaguely Buddhist philosophy, director David O. Russell keeps it relatively light and fresh.

Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) is a semi-successful environmentalist who is struggling to save a stretch of land. But a Wal-Mart-esque ""Huckabees"" franchise store is going to be erected, and the chain's executive, Brad Stand (Jude Law) is making life even worse for Albert. But things take a sudden twist when Albert encounters a doorman three times, and becomes convinced that the heck with coincidence -- this is clearly a sign.

So he enlists a pair of existentialist detectives,  Vivian and Bernard Jaffe (Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman), who believes that NOTHING happens by coincidence. Everything is connected, yada yada. As the detectives scrutinize Albert's life to find its meaning, the odd little trio encounter a conflicted fireman (Mark Wahlberg), a mysterious French woman, Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) whose philosophy is the polar opposite of the Jaffes'.

Imagine Charlie Kaufman pondering spiritual philosophy, and you've got the general tone of "" I Heart Huckabees."" It's got lines like ""Have you ever transcended space and time?"", but then dares to spin around and make fun of the very philosophies it ponders. Not many comedies with a message dare to do that.

But can a movie be funny and yet study the nature of existance and nothingness? Apparently it can. It's a weird little film, but it intends to be -- it's a mixture of philosophical navel-gazing and goofy comedy. It often makes no sense, and its ending really isn't one. However, tolerant filmgoers may be carried away by its infectious sense of fun, and its wickedly funny dialogue.

Jason Schwartzman was the soul of ""Rushmore,"" and he's still endearing and lovably offbeat here. Jude Law seems flat and somewhat annoying, but Naomi Watts glows as his moderately bonkers girlfriend, who wants to check out her ""infinite nature."" Mark Wahlberg puts in a glorious performance as a very confused client, and Tomlin and Hoffman appear to be enjoying their quirky roles.

""I Heart Huckabees"" is the sort of quirky, half-serious-half-satirical film that only comes around once in a while. Okay, it doesn't make sense much of the time. Just sit back and enjoy the hilarious dialogue and solid acting.",1096588800,9,2523,5.109223300970874
2195125,4,B0006TPE4M,"Be prepared for Mark Wahlberg's turn as a hilarious comedic actor. One of the opening scenes when Wahlberg is screaming at his girlfriend because the world's problems are petroleum based sets the movie on self-conscious but funny trip. David O. Russell (during the Q&A session at the screening I went to) seemed shallowly pretentious but he writes a witty and intelligent script that is as anti-intellectual as it tries to be intellectual. I dug the references to existentialism but the buddhist leanings were a bit heavy-handed. ""Everything is nothing and nothing is everything and everything's connected."" Yeah yeah, we get it.

Judd Law, stripped of his english accent, loses his deadly charm. But Naomi Watts is hilarious as a daffy spokesmodel turned philosophical neophyte. Mark Wahlberg and Jason Schwartzman's friendship and a visit to a Sudanese refugee's adopted family are the scenes that had me painfully weezing with laughter. Hoffman and Tomlin are perfect, but that's to be expected.

""You can't deal with my infinite nature.""

It gives you this sort of deep philosophy that is an interesting debate and the final conclusion is a good lesson to learn, but the ""deep"" philosophy barely even broaches the subject.  It's fake philosophy.  It's like an idiot hired a philosopher to help write it and took some decent dialogue from the philosopher, but because he didn't get it, it remains nothing more than pedantic dialogue and a plot without any meaningful destination.

Where else will you see Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jude Law, Naomi Watts, Mark Wahlberg, and Isabelle Huppert in one show?  Sorry if I missed a few...They were all great but I have to single out Jude Law for special praise.  As the guy we are supposed to hate he is wonderful....loved his American accent!

The one thing that bothered me a little was the apparent message that good looking people, especially blonds, are bad ant the shlumpy, dark haired guy (Jason Shwartzman) is the virtuous one.  Ostensibly the film tries to show that both guys are part of the other which is good...but the ending doesn't play out that way.  Naomi Watts, despairing of being pretty, leaves Jude Law, who also also loses his house and job.  It's replacing one stereotype with another. I think a more ""complete"" sequel is in order.

There are many brilliant films out there, but none have been able to hold a mirror up to how I (and many others) see the world.

2195249,5,B0006TPE4M,"I Heart Huckabees is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! The film is well done; the only qualm I have about it is that things develop rapidly at certain points in the movie. The acting is very convincing; and the casting couldn't have been done any better. The choreography and cinematography are terrific; and the musical score enhances the film as well.

When the action starts (and there's plenty of it), Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) is puzzled by a coincidence that he believes could have great meaning and maybe even say something about his existence here on Earth. What is Albert's coincidence? He meets a tall, slender black man (Stephen Nimieri played by Ger Duany) three times in three locations; Albert is confused about what this coincidence might mean. Albert also wouldn't mind discovering the meaning of life and even the universe in general. Thus Albert goes to husband and wife team Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian (Lily Tomlin) who are existential detectives; they will spy on him so he can find out the meaning of his coincidence and more.

But not only do Bernard and Vivian spy on Albert, they also act as a type of existentialist therapist team; they want Albert to discover more about himself and the universe using unusual methods like placing Albert is what seems to be a zipper/body bag; and Bernard shows Albert the meaning of what appears to be a simple white blanket. As the plot moves along we see what develops as Albert tries so hard to find out the answers to his questions.

Of course, things are even more complicated. Enter firefighter and environmentalist Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlberg) who gets involved with Bernard, Vivian and their professional nemesis Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert); and Brad Stand (Jude Law) also becomes a client of Bernard and Vivian's although Brad is primarily worried about his climb up the corporate ladder at Huckabees, a department store supposedly teaming up with Albert's activist group Open Spaces so Huckabees can look good in the public eye.

There is more to the plot that I'll leave out so you can enjoy this as much as I did! I think the best way to view this film is as a quirky comedy that pokes fun at existentialism; philosophy; therapy; people desperate to know the meaning of life and their place in the universe; the ongoing battle between philosophers and even therapists with different points of view; environmentalists; models going through personal crises (like Dawn Campbell played by Naomi Watts) and more. There is also a brief cameo by Shania Twain.

I Heart Huckabees is a 2 DVD set. There are 2 rather interesting optional running commentaries on the first DVD; the second DVD includes 22 deleted/extended scenes with outtakes; a production documentary; a ""detective infomercial;"" a music video I really liked; a ""Charlie Rose Show"" interview with director/co-writer David O. Russell--and more!

I Heart Huckabees is a great film with many, many funny moments that had me laughing out loud. As someone who has been both a counselor and a counseling patient, I found the way the film pokes fun at people's personal issues and philosophies to be hysterical and not at all offensive. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who like quirky comedies that deal with major life issues; competing philosophies; therapy and so much more will not be disappointed.",1360281600,5,3395,4.926573426573427

Yet, this philosophical comedy in postmodern atmosphere does have a lot to offer.
In the context of its struggling protagonists it offers deeper and more unconventional meanings of life, it has sharp dialogue, is creative and funny, with several hilarious situations. It is entertaining and original.
The philosophical content is quite adequate, with a mystical-spiritual flavor.
The acting is generally quite good - some are stealing the show - and now and then the interactions are very charged.

As a project this movie may have been pretentious, but its tone is definitely not pretentious.
Generally there is a warm feel underneath the movie as a whole, it is not at all bitter or trying to outsmart the viewer.

Approach this movie the way its intended to be approached and you will enjoy it. Stiff hardcore existentialists may take this work as a knock on their beliefs but only half of them will care (see what I did there?).

Mark Wahlberg is severely under appreciated in his role as the inquisitive protagonist. His childlike mannerisms and obsessions with oil are hilarious.

The messages that the movie attempts to deliver are far from layered. Characters in this movie wear their beliefs on their sleeve and sometimes its a bit  drastic...but thats why this is a comedy.

I laughed often and watched many times. If nothing else this is a comedy that's unlike most. It approaches a life topic with a different perspective; and while its message is basic and clear..well its a message that doesn't get out in the general media much. You have to start somewhere!

Unfortunately, despite his reported assurance on the set, I don't believe the director knew what he wanted to do with the material.  The idea of a couple of philosophical detectives working to get to the bottom of a client's life was definitely promising material, but the whole thing was swamped by pretentiousness.

Heck, the idea of a firefighter completely giving up on his life until he got some answers to philosphical questions was enough to carry this movie:  they should have dialed down all the philosophy and ramped up the comedy.

I think that the ""real"" story is about people's attempts to find out what is important in life). There is also a bit of philosophy thrown in, so the film might make you think a little bit.

2195284,3,B0006TPE4M,"I ""heart"" Huckabees is in the vein of screwy, thinking man's comedies of recent years. It's about a frustrated activist and idealist who can't even keep control of his group from a friendlier corporate figure that co opts them... and it's about his struggle at the same time with the meaning of life. This character, Albert, also connects with a ""existential"" detective agency by accident... these people are like life coaches except they take it much farther in trying to get him to achieve Buddhist like enlightenment. They're played delightfully by Lily Tomlin, and Dustin Hoffman in a wig that's in my opinion one of the funniest parts of the movie.

While it's an admirable try to pull off a thinking man's comedy, if you've seen a Wes Anderson movie it's a lot harder to get into. This ""surreal"" comic reality just doesn't bend surreal enough or real enough... it doesn't find a believable space of it's own you can just let go and enjoy. Stylistically, where something like The Royal Tennenbaums is both relentlessly charming and emotional.. Huckabees isn't really either. It's just trying to get through all the ""meaning of life"" jazz and philosophy to the point the movie has no place to go with the characters but that. I see it more as pre-Freshman entry into the genre than a real contender.

Enter Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian (Lily Tomlin), a team of existential detectives, who also happen to be married to each other.  They are determined to take on Albert's case, pro bono, and find out the root cause(s) of his anxiety and what blocks him from becoming truly free of what shackles him to his turbulent past.  Through taking on this pro bono case, Bernard and Vivian also have encounters with Albert's colleagues at Huckabees, who are struggling with identity crises of their own--co-workers Brad (Jude Law) and Dawn (Naomi Watts).

I really don't know how to best describe this film.  If you are looking to compare this to a distinctive style, I would say the closest it comes to is the brilliant THE SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, written by Jane Wagner, and performed by Lily Tomlin (who steals this film, along with Dustin Hoffman).  HUCKABEES truly examines what drives us in life, what is coincidence, what lies in our ultimate control in the world and how it shapes our personas in the world.

I would consider myself an existentialist, and I am an avid fan and reader of existentialist and postmodern philosophy; I love Camus, Sartre, Kierkegaardand, Freud, Heidegger, and my personal favorite, Nietzsche.

I hate to start the review like that, but I was afraid that if I didn't the Personal Taste Police that are so active here would simply declare, ""He doesn't get it, ignore his review.""

All of that being said, this is an incredibly ignorant, poorly written, poorly conceived, inaccurate, meaningless pile of drivel. If you have any actual knowledge of, or interest in, philosophy or specifically existentialism, stay away from this film.

Russell and Jeff Baena have written a highly intelligent comedy about a man who's trying to make sense of his life.  That man is Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), a founder of a group called the Open Space Coalition who are trying to preserve forest and marsh area's where big business want to tear it down.  In his latest attempt he's joined forces with a chain-store known as Huckabees whose exec on the way up Brad Stand (Jude Law) seems to have a hidden agenda.  All this aside, Albert is troubled by a very tall African teenager that has crossed his path on three occasions and he is convinced this coincidence has substantial meaning in his life, so he seeks out the help of Vivian & Bernard Jaffe (Tomlin and Hoffman), two existential detectives, hiring them to follow his every move to decipher how his life makes sense.

Vivian and Bernard are also helping Tommy (Mark Whalberg), a firefighter with strong views on humanity's role in destroying the environment.  When Brad finds out about Albert's association with these detectives he sees this as a way to get at Albert, to diminish his credibility with Open Spaces and thus gain control of the land and marsh Huckabees wishes to tear down.  So he himself enlists the help of Vivian and Bernard in order to jab at Albert's sanity, and this affects his girlfriend Dawn (Naomi Watts in another brilliant performance) who begins to take these detectives advise seriously and this jeopardizes her relationship with Brad and with Huckabees since she is `the voice' and `the look' of the store.

When Tommy and Albert meet they decide to ditch Vivian and Bernard's methods in pursuit of Caterine Vauben (Isabelle Huppert), a French existential detective who is in competition with the Jaffes.  Their methods, while similar, are actually at two separate extremes and throughout the film Albert finds the balance he needs to make sense of it all.  This film is pure joy, hilarious from start to finish thanks in part to the brilliant acting on the entire cast, Tomlin and Law are standouts to me for their comedic timing is impeccable, and Whalberg is a complete surprise, holding his own and proving he can act.

Me? I loved ""I Heart Huckabees."" I loved it so much I can't even review it. I loved every performance, every line of dialogue; I loved it so much I want to form a club with others who loved this movie ... Normally, I can't stand Jason Schwartzman, and even he didn't ruin it for me.

How can you tell which camp you'll fall into? Here's a test. Agree or Disagree with the following statements:

1.) My friends and family tell me I think too much, and that my life would be much easier if I would just relax and not rock the boat.

2.) I've tried meditation, but gotten sidetracked when I found myself imagining taking a machete to people who annoy me.

3.) I could pick Franz Kafka out of a line-up that included Jean Paul Satre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Buster Keaton.

4.) The thought of sex with a nihilist leaves me contemplating nothingness, and yet strangely aroused.

5.) I've always wanted to see Marky Mark bicycle in fireman's knee-high rubber boots, while protesting the world petroleum crisis.

6.) I once lost a girlfriend / boyfriend to someone who was cover-model pretty / handsome, but had no soul, and that, yet again, caused me to think too much, and then to meditate, and then to imagine the whole machete thing.

7.) I think that the objectification of women is shallow and obscene, and Amish bonnets turn me on.

8.) Dustin Hoffman does a faux friendly, ""I've got your nuts in my cracker"" smile better and better as he ages.

9.) Lily Tomlin is reason enough to see any movie.

10.) Cruely, Manipulation, Meaninglessness.

Give yourself as many points as you want for each ""yes"" answer, and then give yourself an equal number of points for each ""no"" answer. Cause, you know? It's all one.",1154217600,132,1875,4.508875739644971
2195303,5,B0006TPE4M,"This has become one of my favorite movies of late. Will I always love it? Not sure, but for now its the sort of film that I can watch and watch again. Many other reviewers have noted that much of the interest of the film is intellectual, in fact that the comedy, however sophmoric from one perspective, depends upon an intelectual underpinning that is probably not shared by most viewers. And I agree. Trust me, there is much more than the surface farce going on here. I would note that many of the other reviewers seem over focused on Existentialism as a philosophical school. I think this is taking the notion of ""existential detective"" too narrowly. In fact, the greatest philosophical influence in the film seems to me to be Buddhism, which the director has a long involvement with. I once recommended the film to a fellow teacher as a textbook intro to Zen. The on-going tension between the affirmative vision of totality and the nihilistic vision captures a Zen motif, as does the ""sudden enlgihtenment"" of the balloon scene. I could go one in great detail. Nor do I think that the film is simply making fun of intellectuals or philosophical seekers; it is far more subtle than that. Suffice it to say that for me the film is powerfully moving, even uplifting, at the same time that it acknowledges the ""manure of human existance"". I doubt that the real difference between those who ""get it"" and those who hate it is intellectual per se ( a number of ""students of philosophy"" posting here hated the film). Its more a matter of one's sense of life, one's attitude towards it: a passion for the depths, for complex thought, and at the same time a joy in the simple, including the simple truth of one's own limitations. Not a film for those too serious to see their own absurdity, nor for those uninterested in taking the time to look beyond the absurd to the serious.",1153440000,3,1871,4.588059701492537

It may have characters that act pretentious, but the overall tone is one of farce, and what it being made fun of is modern philosphy. Since most people who see the movie are not philosophers, and are not even familiar with the philosophical concepts being made fun of - the film will seem pretentious, and inaccessable.  Too bad and sad since it really shows how poor our educational system has become.

It is good that this film was made and it really is funny and satirical ... *if* you already understand the philosophical concepts being used.

2195309,5,B0006TPE4M,"I Heart Huckabees is a movie you'll either love or hate.

It's basically a movie that focuses on characters that are going through an existential crisis.  When they go and get help, they are confronted to two points of view of existence, one more upbeat and another that focuses on the fact that life is only filled with dissapointments, a ""glass half-full/half-empty"" dilemna.
The movie revolves around those individuals trying to find answers through these two points of view, which makes for an interesting story.

There's a great cast.  Mark Wahlberg is great, as is Jason Schwartsman, and while Jude Law gives a good performance, he does tend to become a little irritating, character-wise.

It's a movie I really enjoyed.  You have to give it props for originality.  It tackles the existentialism and not only gives you different believable points of view and theories, but it's not too serious.  There's a certain underlying comedic relief that comes from just the situation the characters find themselves in in general.  Dustin Hoffman and his counterpart were hilarious.

The comedic relief works well, as it doesn't take attention from all the theories that are being tried out, it doesn't make them ridiculous, but at the same time it helps the movie not seem too long.

Overall, it's a great movie if you're up for some philosophical reflection on your existence.  I also loved the fact that they were able to make this movie relatable as to actual problems that we face, such as oil and the ecology.",1146096000,5,1511,4.905511811023622

2195313,2,B0006TPE4M,"I might as well open by saying that I'm extremely picky when it comes to comedies.  I simply don't watch them much: The last comedy I saw in the theater was 'The Life Aquatic...'.  That was over a year ago.  The last comedy I saw prior to that in theater was, I'm pretty sure, 'As Good As It Gets' way back in 1997.  That's a seven year layoff, coming from someone who does actually go to the movies regularly, though not constantly.  So I'm tough to please in this field, I guess.  Nevertheless, when it does come to contemporary comedy, it is films like this that I typically like.  I really like Charlie Kaufman and Wes Anderson, two obvious points of comparison to this film, and the apparent similarity between the various artists is the reason I decided to check this out.  And they are quite similar, with 'I Heart Huckabees' coming of as a lame, heartless Anderson clone. (I'm not necessarily suggesting that this is a knockoff; Russell has been around for a long time, I know, maybe he's been making films like this for years.  Nevertheless, that's what it *feels* like.)  The trouble is this is your quirky oddball character comedy, yet the characters consist of maybe one not particularly amusing quirk, and they are very, very obnoxious, and they don't feel human at all.  In order for this sorta film to work you need to like the characters, which I certainly do not.  Then it just meanders around in circles, each silly, tedious character coming on to do their little bit again and again and again.  It grows remarkably tedious, so much so that I actually gave up and shut the DVD off, the only time I've ever consciously stopped watching something that I paid for.  I eventually caved and finished it off a couple of hours later, but only because I felt I compulsive need to finish what I'd started, and I'd need to have finished it if I ever wanted to review it.  So here I am.

The film has a generally very strong cast, a bit of visual flair and opens with some promise.  It falls apart quickly, with my reaction being pretty much identical to that of Peter Schorn's over at IGN DVD:  ""The first 15 minutes indicated some quirky oddball fun was in store, but the 5 minutes that followed that felt like an hour and the actual hour after that felt like mental cruelty.""  The film doesn't really have much of a plot per se, it's mostly just situational, involving the conflict between an environmental activist (Jason Schwartzman) and a weasely PR guy at a Wal-Mart (Jude Law) esque corporation called Huckabees.  The Schwartzman character is curious about his place in the world and a couple of bizarre coincidences, so at the beginning of the film he hires a couple of existential detectives (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) and they just kinda start screwing around with his life and bringing other people into the conflict, such as disillusioned, anti-petroleum obsessed fireman (Marky Mark) and dimwitted Huckabees spokesmodel and Law's girlfriend. (Naomi Watts) And so on.  Yes a number of things happen, but none of it matters or leads anywhere at all until the very end and I certainly didn't care about any of it anymore at that point.

Again, it starts out alright, with some amusing patter between the ultra-dorky Schwartzman and the detectives, and some of their methods are kind of amusing.  (They follow him around, everywhere, and use sensory deprivation therapy on him which leads to an initially amusing collage-esque scene.  Like much everything else in this movie, this conceit is interesting the first time, tiresome the next 5 times.)  But the film has got nowhere to go, and most of the other characters they introduce are very tiresome. (Now this isn't to say that the final 80% of the film is utterly irredeemable.  It has a few moments, but it never comes to life at all, and there are plenty of parts where it absolutely falls flat on its face.  Note the mud puddle sex scene, in particular. Pretty much all the stuff involving the French nihilist, actually.)

I really like Schwartzman in general, but here he is largely charmless.  There just isn't anything to his character.  He just wonders about the nature of reality, and complains about deforestation and that's it.  Marky Mark's fireman is utterly unbearable.  He's just so stupid and whiny and he inarticulately goes on and on about petroleum concern in pretty much every scene he's in.  He's tiresome the first time you see him, and this grows to pure hatred by the end. (One assumes Russell identifies particularly with these two characters, so I applaud his willingness to make light of them, but he can't pull it off at all. Perhaps it really is just easier to mock others than to mock yourself.)  Law's character is just extraordinarily bland, and doesn't earn a single laugh.  He's kinda the villain of the film, but we rarely get to see him acting actively villainous.  He's always got a front on.  He's just slick and boring.  Hoffman and Tomlin lose their luster almost immediately as they have, like Marky Mark, only one bit which is repeated again and again.  (Hoffman goes on and no about how everything is connected.  Fairly amusing the first time, but it's exactly the same every time it's repeated)  Then there's the Watts character, who is based on the idea that stupid people are funny.  Well, Dawn is stupid, I'll give her that, and she's less obnoxious than some of the other characters, though this may largely be simply because she's got relatively little screen time.

Some people try and say that this film attempting to be deep or complex, but I don't buy it.  Not just that it says something about the human condition, but that it was even really intended to.  I think Russell is just having fun with this pseudo-philosophical stuff.  (At least one of us is....)

Eventually things do come together a bit at the end.  Not to say that it gets better or more interesting, but something actually happens other than the characters simply standing around and repeating dialogue and ideas for the fourth time.  Some characters change or get their comeuppance or whatever, but I don't give a damn cause none of these characters is worth a damn.

Yeah, this film is mostly a formless wreck.  On the plus side, it does have a few scenes where Naomi Watts doesn't have very many clothes on, but that's about all it has going for it, and there are not enough of them to help much.  Not nearly enough to save the film.

2195314,4,B0006TPE4M,"From the director of ""Flirting With  Disaster"" and ""Three Kings"" comes a philosophy major's dream of a comedy. Albert (Jason Schwartzman of ""Rushmore"") is an idealistic young conservationist who hires married existentialist detectives (yes, you read that right) to look into the coincidences in his life, determine what they mean, and help him discover the true nature of the universe. He soon buddies up with Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), a fireman who goes around wearing his firefighting boots even when he's not fighting fires and rides a bicycle everywhere he goes because he believes petroleum is evil.

Sound bizarre? It is, and a film with these kinds of thought pretensions could easily have gone off the rails, but the stellar cast (including Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin as the detectives and Jude Law as Albert's `nemesis') combined with a strong script keeps it afloat and provides a lot of absurdist fun. If it hasn't become a cult already, ""I Heart Huckabees"" almost certainly will, because it has that kind of offbeat appeal, and this two-disc collection packs on all the extras a devout fan (like me) could wish for.

2195315,5,B0006TPE4M,"I've read most of the reviews here and although there's plenty of stuff I agree with, none actually reflect what I think about this movie. Hence, a review of my own...

First thing to know about Huckabees: It's a comedy and not a philosophical movie. Dont get lost in the philosophies thrown around, they are not that deep and their purpose is to give more background to each respective character...

What I felt was the point of the movie was to try and make fun of our existential questions. Everybody, either in a superficial or really deep way have played with the questions of Life, the Universe and Everything. In this movie you get a large group of diverse characters who are made to do just that: Wonder about life...

You get the French nihilist and the two existential detectives, who have supposedly thought a lot about existence, you get the corporate suit-and-tie guy (Jude Law) who is pre-occupied with success and self-image, his girlfriend (Naomi Watts), a not-so-bright top model who (in a funny caricature way) fights depression, you get a happy Christian family, you get Albert, the enviromentalist, who HAS to know whats going on with his life, Wahlberg, confused and depressed after 9-11...

...in fact at every point of the film you get a glimpse of different personalities, intentionally stereotyped, dealing with existence in their own way... Literally, every sequence is about that, pondering the question, dodging the question, being ignorant or actively denying there is a point to the question at all.

And here's the good bit: Its all presented in a wonderfully light and comedic fashion. The dialogues are really funny (considering the subject) and the performances are absolutely *stellar*. Every actor really serves his role and is utterly convincing as the stereotype Rusell wants to portray...

The movie is really, really smart too. Now, I need to clarify ""smart"". Not as in ""wow, that was really deep"" but rather as its really smart in the way it brings all those different personalities together, in funny situations, whilst all the time keeping up with that oh-so-familiar existential backdrop. Because, lets face it folks, we all question life from time to time. This movie is superb at showing a vast array of characters doing just that and whatsmore doing it while talking with each other...

Simply put, watching the ""poet-environmentalist"", who thinks is really intellectual have a discussion with that christian family at the dinner table IS funny. The point is not following their argument per se (although it is really nicely done to serve that purpose) but watching how the discussion blasts off into a fight, both parties thinking the other is crazy and misguided. And thats a theme that is really prevalent throughout the film. Everybody thinks they got it right and at every step trying to convince the other, the dialogues are pure gold (my favourite being the lamentation of the Spanish old lady and Mark Wahlberg's impatience and petroleum fixation).

Hats off to Rusell for coming up with the idea and the characters and sequences to demonstrate it. And the performances...

As for any deeper meanings? Well, obviously the French nihilist and the two detectives (Hoffman is amazing...) represent two ""philosophies"", negative and positive respectively. It's not something really deep, more like pop philosophy (although they could serve as a small nudge to read more about them if anybody's interested) and Rusell at the end pulls a kind of  ying-yang deal, that both are right and complement each other, which again its not something really deep but it is a valid thought and not just pseudointellectual crap...

Besides, the point REALLY ISN'T about the philosophical meanings, everyone will have an opinion of their own watching the film (about how smart or stupid they are). The point is to sit back and enjoy humans get themselves in a knot (or not!) in a highly comedic background.

Personally, I laughed really hard at many scenes, enjoyed the flow of the story, really enjoyed the acting and directing and at the end, I felt I had seen a great and very different kind of movie.

2195316,4,B0006TPE4M,"This important movie encouraged me to start asking existential questions about my own life and what is real.

I mean, take `Doogie Howser MD' the TV show, for example.  Should it be Doogie Howser MD... or should it really be Doogie Howser CD?  Because Doogie Howser wasn't really an MD.  He was a fictional character, so in our reality, he isn't really an MD.  But the theme music was put on a CD, so `Doogie Howser' IS a CD.

So I think when they put the show in syndication or do a movie of it, they should call it Doogie Howser CD.

And I think the movie should show the teenage Doogie grown up in his sixties.  Robert Redford would make a great sixty year old Doogie, don't you think?  And what about Robert De Niro as that rascally pal Vinnie Delpino?  I think I'll pitch this to a few studios...

2195317,4,B0006TPE4M,"Despite the ""existential"" subject matter, of all the string of movies I Heart Huckabees seems to be following on from (Garden State, American Splendour, 21 Grams, Big Fish, Eternal Sunshine, The Life Aquatic, Lost In Translation, Donnie Darko, Igby Goes Down, Punch Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Memento, Adaptation, Rushmore), this is more accessable, more cute and fun, has less delusions of grandeur, and left me feeling less ""out of the loop"" than any of them. I was reluctlant to like it at first since I think most of the aforementioned films failed to live up to their hype, and I figured this film had much of the same fan base, but I softened up to it pretty fast and never felt like it was trying to put one over on me. Well the scene with Albert and Katerine dunking each others heads in mud was a head scratcher, as was Katerine inexplicably getting into the parents apartment without them seeing her. The search for the ""meaning of life"" isn't that intrusive on the plot, any time it comes up it's used more for comedy than insight.

The hypothesis that everything is ""connected"" isn't defined in terms that allow it to be tested within the context of established reality and therefore does not warrant addressing. I thought the possibility that the detectives' philisophical gibberish was supposed to be meaningful could be safely disregarded, given the fact that Albert, the main character, expressed the viewer reaction of not comprehending the meaning of what they were saying. Albert is the star, not the detectives, so it seems obvious to view Albert's perspective as the one intended to have the most resonance with viewers. If you consider the existensial detectives to be insane gibberish talkers, as Albert seems to most of the time, the issue of whether what they're saying offers profound philisophical insight or not is irrelevant. The purpose the detective characters serve is to provide an atmosphere of lunacy, the details of what they're saying being insignificant to the overall focus of the movie. It's a movie driven by quirky characters and comedic dialogue rather than the conceptual philisophical backdrop. It has a similar comedic approach to Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Home Movies. The scenes where the detectives are introducing their theories to Albert are funny in exactly the same way as the scenes of Frylock arguing with the Mooninites in ATHF.

The story is very creative and needs to be followed closely to appreciate--or even understand--the movie.  I agree that this movie isn't for everyone.  I can't really imagine your ""average"" multi-plex visiting American movie viewer enjoying an absurdist film about existential detectives helping an environmentalist poet discover the meaning of his life.  However, if you can handle its wackiness and all the philosophy within it, you will find that it's actually quite funny and pretty meaningful.  If you liked Richard Linklater's ""Waking Life,"" I believe you will like this movie.  In fact, I think ""I Heart Huckabees"" is probably more accessible because it's less dense and has way more humor.

The acting and casting were great.  Jason Schwartzman was perfect as the searching environmental poet, Naomi Watts was hilariously offbeat as the seemingly vapid Huckabees spokesgirl, and Jude Law was great as the corporate creep.

Let me provide you with some compelling reasons to purchase this disc: 1) Make no mistake, this film is WEIRD; 2) It has an underlying feel-good tone, making it a perfect flick to come home to after a crappy day at the office; 3) It ranks high on the ""re-watchability"" scale; 4) While the humor isn't for everyone, those that do find it funny, find it EXTREMELY funny; 5) The cinematography was very interesting and incorporated elements that I had never seen before in a film; 6) The soundtrack made an already funny film, funnier (and weirder); 7) The star-studded cast really nailed their roles; 8) I'd buy it for the ""dinner scene"" alone.  All in all, this movie isn't for everyone, but those who enjoy it, enjoy it immensely.

If you are still with the movie after about 15 minutes you will like it. You are probably already a fan of all the Wes Anderson films. It does remind you a litle of 'Rushmore' which also starred Jason Schwartmann. In that way it's an intellectual comedy.

The acting is good. Schwartmann seems to reprise his Max Fisher role from Rushmore, but now older but still quirky. Jude Law is good as a slick yuppi. Best of the film is Dustin Hoffman though as the 'therapist' in a great duo with his wife played by Lily Tomlin.

Political in the sense that I Heart Huckabees is definitely taking a stab at political ideologues and their inability to see beyond their leanings.  And personal due to the fact that it is individuals that ultimately make up any political faction, and it is up to that individual to avoid falling into the ideological trap.

It's clear that at the end, Schwartzman & Wahlberg take a bit of both sides of the debate in order to determine their own boundaries of contentment.  For anyone to try and go deeper than that analysis might miss the point, and not see the film for what it is, an attack on blind obedience & followership.",1131148800,7,819,4.627586206896551

2195329,2,B0006TPE4M,"Woody Allen once used to write brilliant short stories.  One of them he wrote told of a woman who goes to a detective and hires him to find God.  It was hysterically funny and intelligent at the same time.

This film reminds me of that except for one big thing.  THIS FILM IS NOT FUNNY.  I think Lily Tomlin is a genius, and she does wring a funny comic moments out of it because of ..... well, because she's Lily Tomlin.  Jason Schwartzman, alas, is not.  Here he does a Ben Stiller sort of impression, but Ben Stiller has a sort of funny delivery that Jason can't seem to get across, leaving his scenes more flat than funny.

This film has lofty ambitions, it tries to fill a void where Woody left off many years ago.  The problem is, the desire, but the talent is not there.  Is this the state of ""intellectual comedy"" today?  If so, it's a sad affair.  Woody certainly can't fill it anymore, his gifts left him long ago- but this just proves an heir has yet to be found.  The problem is, since people want this kind of art, they are willing to recommend it in the face that nothing else is out there that resembles it.  The truth is, though, it's not good enough and no one should pretend it is.

Avoid this film.  Instead, pick up the collection of Woody Allen stories- there are several books out there- they are far more enjoyable and witty and brilliant than this will ever be.",1130025600,5,1385,4.289575289575289

I don't see why some people simply must complain about problems they make up themselves and then make it public. Maybe they want attention, I wouldn't know because I've never done it myself; but this movie is a MUST see for anyone ""trully"" into ANY type of philosophy at all. Existence is a very abstract concept and is portrayed nicely in this movie. One thing I found out to be very true, is the idea that when they hit themselves with the rubber ball (yes this sounds weird but it's not) they have that feeling, but later on they are dragged back into life's drama and that this is a cicle. I must say that if you ""really"" enjoy philosophy watch it.

No. This guy is not Socrates or Plato or Aristotle, he is no genious so don't expect a masterpiece that will stand in the tests of time but expect an enjoyable movie that does have it's moments and that will make you ask yourself questions throughout the movie.

2195331,3,B0006TPE4M,"Director David O. Russel categorically says in his interview with the Japanese press that ""I Heart Huckabees' is a comedy.""  At the same time, he makes it clear that the film is greatly influenced by Uma Thurman's daddy and his mentor, Robert Thurman, Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia University.

What kind of film do you expect from this premise?  Roger Ebert just didn't get it.  Several reviewers of the respected British newspapers gave this film the lowest rating.  Me?  I still don't know.  Please, Amazon, give us 'I Prefer Not To Vote' button for rating, and I will click that.

I admit, 'I Heart Huckabees' has some funny bits.  Jason Schwartzman is Albert, avid activist who fights to preserve nature (in his case, forest, swamp, and a rock ... yes, a rock) from the big company's development.  And he reads his own poems before the local press as statement.  But Albert is also intrigued by the possibility of some hidden law surrounding his life, for he encountered the same tall guy from Africa at three different places.  Does this signify anything?

From then, the film starts to show its unique (superficially at least) aspect.  The husband and wife detective team Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin take up the ""case"" of this client, and they maintain that his experience can be interpreted in another way.  Albert is given a therapy (kind of), and then the team starts to ""investigate"" the case of the client.  In this case, his own life.

But their investigation is no ordinary one, not only openly following him and setting cameras and microphones in Albert's office, but also gives influences to the people around Albert, including Mark Wahlberg's fire fighter who hates the idea of using oil (and he refuses to hop on the fire engine); Jude Law's sweet-talking elite businessman working for Huckabees; and Naomi Watts' lovely, very lovely model (yes, her fans, she is).  To make the entangled relations more complicated, another philosopher Isabelle Huppert flies from France, and this seductive teacher leads some of the characters to the uncharted territories for them (and for the philosophical detective team).  Her lessons include one of the dirtiest love scenes in the movie history.

So is this funny?  Sometimes, yes.  But Russell's lofty aim to make a comedy out of philosophy ends up with a pretentious film, with many annoyingly talky sequences which I find it hard to follow.  Or am I too slow?  Perhaps, and perhaps I am too unkind, but anyway the film's biggest problem is, like in his previous film 'Three Kings,' all of Russell's characters appear as caricature, and then suddenly start to act like human.  With skilled hand (of Woody Allen, for instance), the comical and the philosophical go together well.  David O. Russell only relies on the charms of his quirky characters, which are considerable, it is true, but not good enough to sustain the running time of a feature film.

I'm not saying 'I Heart Huckabees' is terrible.  Far from it.  I say this is not my cup of tea, and perhap you may feel the same way.  But talking about comedy and philosophy, I must point out that films like superb 'Rushmore' (in which Jason Schwartzman played a similar role) are delightful experiences AND can be very philosophical, or thought-provoking.",1128211200,5,3297,4.909584086799277

Plato said that in his philosophy - it is very appropriate to a thorough understanding of the film. What is the point of the film, you might ask? I would say, what is the point of life? That is the point of the film, the question, ""what is the point of life?""!!! The film sort of studies two different approaches. One is the decidedly greek school, the notion that everything in the world is FUNDAMENTALLY CONNECTED and thereby everything is good and has a purpose and reason. This is counteracted by the decidedly russian and chinese schools that say that nothing in the world  is connected but that everything is pointless and the only things that mean anything is like slapping your friends in the face (ok i didn't get that part! lol!). But, it is an extremely interesting dialogue between the two partys, or schools. I personally like dustin hoffmans approach, that everything in the world is connected and good. I just feel that it's better to accept this approach because its always better to be positive, and if you believe that the world is all connected and all of history is in like a grain of sand than there will be no more wars and no more fighting.

2195342,4,B0006TPE4M,"I Heart Huckabees is definitely not like anything you've seen before.  I have to give it at least a couple of stars for attempting something different and unique, given that so many movies are just cookie-cutter copies of one another.  It's refreshing to see a movie that is not predictable and in which you don't see the ending coming 90 minutes beforehand.

This movie is kind of an allegory of different philosophies.  Schwartzman starts off disillusioned with environmentalism, and successively confronts and rejects materialism (Brad), existentialism (the detectives), religion (the African guy's adoptive family), nihilism (the French woman) and narcissism (the Huckabees girl), rejecting each of them in turn.  It is only when Schwartzman thinks for himself and synthesizes something from his own intelligence and experience that he is able to reach a personal resolution.  I'm not sure that's what the message of this movie is supposed to be, but it's what I'm taking with me, and I'm sticking to it.  Having said all that, you get a college-freshman-bull-session level view of all these philosophies, rather than a serious examination thereof; but, this is a 2 hour comedy, not a survey class, so that's OK.

While this is billed as a comedy, this is not a laugh-a-minute film, although there are some very funny parts.  The performances are uniformly good.  In particular, Dustin Hoffman actually acts for a change, instead of playing himself like he has for the last 10 years.  Mark Wahlberg also turns in a standout performance.

The one thing that isn't unique is the tired old ""evil capitalist"" cliche, which first came to prominence in ""Jaws,"" and hasn't really gone away since.  Still, it's a comedy, so you can just roll with it.

Not everyone will care for this movie, which has nothing to do with the viewer's intelligence, but rather on their taste and their tolerance for quirkiness.

He's run into the same tall African man three times, in three unrelated circumstances, and it causes him to wonder about the meaning of life. He finds a business card belonging to an ""existential detective"" and thinks they might be able to help him.

The point of the movie is to chuckle at Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman - playing the married-to-each-other existential detectives - as they discover that one of their clients (Jude Law, an arrogant sales executive) has placed Kafka books in his trash for them to find. The point is to catch yourself wondering about the meaning of life for a moment - and then to be embarrassed that you did.

It is about a guy who works for Open Spaces trying to save the enviorment and he goes to the exterstental dective and trys to find out about a coincedence he had. To be honest I did not watch the whole movie. I fell asleep about 45 mins into it because it was not keeping my attention. I tried to watch it again and I again got the very sleepy feeling.

2195352,5,B0006TPE4M,"I can see why many of the reviewers clearly didn't ""get it.""  This film is bound to be over the heads of the vast majority of the people who see it--so far over their heads that most won't even realize that they missed 90% of it and will just think it wasn't very good.  (And by the way, to respond to some of the other reviews, it has almost nothing in common with ""Being John Malkovitch,"" other than being unconventional, since that film was odd but not even remotely deep by comparison.)

""Existential comedy"" doesn't really cover it.  It's frequently almost too intense to be funny, at least if you actually understand the larger philosophical context and full significance of what is said.

This is a film about the nature of reality and what it looks like as the illusion that is commonly mistaken for reality painfully unravels.  As such, those who have never tumbled down the rabbit hole themselves aren't likely to understand or enjoy this film.  But for those who have (you know who you are), it is a must-see.",1119139200,8,1020,4.571428571428571
2195353,4,B0006TPE4M,"As someone who has read Sartre and other investigations into philosophy and the meaningness of society, the self described intellectual romp television previews of this movie had me anticipating the DVD release. I was curious to discover if the movie lived up to the expectations. Are these investigators really going to explore man's interpretation of our existence? The fact that these investigators are played by Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman, two actors that I enjoy watching, didn't inhibit my interest either. If you are well read on the subjects played out in the movie, you might feel as though the variables are exhibited as two opposing extremes, with no room for any grey area's in-between or any possibilities that reside outside of the boxes. And you might feel teased that once these two established options are portrayed that the plot seems to be repeating itself without further exploration, without delving into why we assume these dichotomies, what the historical references are, or any new suggestions for these quandaries. Except of course for the end, which apparently is supposed to be some sort of epiphany, but ends up being a rather predictable and disappointing resolution. Bear in mind that I do come from a scientific perspective, meaning I don't necessarily examine our questioning as a form of destiny or fate that needs to be discovered, but rather as how our own minds have a hard wired drive to find one. I am fascinated with understanding functional neurology and exactly how the brain's physiology fires off these philosophical neurons. I do admire the production of this movie, and for the mainstream audience it might be thoughtful enough, and you will think about it for a day or two, or three which is more than I can say for a lot of movies. I do think that they might of held back when this movie was in development, perhaps there should be two versions, this one that brings up the ideas, and a second that assumes we can handle more. In spite of all of this, I did enjoy it, even if I was waiting for something bigger to happen, I would still recommend it, and I will watch it again.",1119052800,,2127,4.782608695652174

One woman who hated the film gave 5 STARS to the ""Lamaze Stretch the Giraffe"" and rates the ""Schick Quattro for Women High Performance Razor"" as ""AWESOME"".

2195359,4,B0006TPE4M,"This is an absurdist, symbolic, farcical fable, a brilliant satire of a sick society peopled, inevitably, with sick persons - guess who? - ourselves!

The film tells us to ask ""How am I not myself?"" and indicates that ""we bring our own chains"". Its critique exists at several levels - the psychological, the familial, the societal, the cultural, the political,  the philosophical, the corporate/financial, the technological, thus exemplifying one of the film's basic themes i.e. the interconnectedness of all things.

Beneath the comedic surface, the ideas of several thinkers are invoked: Kafka, Sartre,Camus, Buber, Orwell, Illich, Derrida,  Whitehead, Freud. Most are not mentioned by name, but their ideas are there.

 I thought the acting was mostly superb. Jude Law's portrayal of Brad was especially salient. Early on, his manic good humour had many false, strangely inconsistent notes, as he acted it, suggesting the falsity of his corporate 'performance' -  a great portrayal, I thought, by a good actor playing a bad actor.  When Brad's brittle facade finally crumbled, I found it quite moving. Naomi Watts, a fine actress, was also very good here, as her facade also crumbled. Tomlin's acting ability was not fully exploited but she had good moments - her subtle non-verbal acting at times was amusing and effective.  Hoffman was amusing. Albert and Tommy were well played, good guys with serious flaws - Albert thinks he's a good poet and that that will help his cause. Tommy is so anti-petroleum that he rides a bicycle to fires! Yes, weird, unrealistic, out of touch, but they help each other. Great film, I think - lots of meat there, I could see it again.  Of course,  the film has its defects, indeed some people may see it as pretentious, incoherent nonsense - but that's life. Tastes vary.",1117238400,5,1808,5.033557046979865

The only good thing about this film is the cast, whose performances are sucked dry by the cocaine-induced pace.

Contrary to my expectations, this film struck me as complete bologna. From the opening scenes to the end, which I saw only out of a regrettable sense of obligation, I didn't believe a line, a block, a shot, or anything else. I felt insulted by its lack of subtlety and obvious, inartistic and sophomoric presentation of its theme. This is a horrible film.
It makes a mockery of profound questions and important issues.
This movie would be rad if you were ripped on a heavy hallucinogen (Oh man, dude, its like...the meaning of life n stuff ya know? Floating eyeballs, whoa!).

Watching this movie is like watching two, oblivious, 12 year-old rich kids make a feeble attempt at having a conversation about the hardships of poverty.

This satyr on the cheesy ""new-age"" psychotherapy movement and utterly shallow and un-insightful answers to life's big questions left me wanting something that grants its audience SOME intelligence. Maybe it's trying to say that affluent Americans seek easy, self-centered, superficial, irrational and convenient answers to difficult questions. But why make a blas film about a blas response to an interesting subject?",1116892800,8,1333,5.077625570776256
2195361,2,B0006TPE4M,"There is an odd idiosyncratic appeal to this movie, but it's really not enough to warrant a recommendation from me. The concept is certainly original as the story follows Albert Markovski, an angry, questioning environmental activist as he tries to piece together a strange series of coincidental run-ins with a tall African man with the help of a couple of oddball ""existential"" detectives. That's only the beginning, as the detectives get involved with the huge department store chain, Huckabees, which has agreed to sponsor Albert's green-friendly program to prevent construction of a store on a marshland. This type of movie requires Woody Allen's perspective on nihilism combined with Alexander Payne's humanistic sensibilities. Unfortunately director/writer David O. Russell lets his ambition get the best of him, and he has made a movie that wants to be intellectual and funny but ends up being neither.

It's a shame because he has assembled a star-studded cast of capable actors, but in a certain way, their presence only compounds the problem since their contributions look so disjointed in what amounts to a convoluted story of self-discovery. The more central problem is that Albert, as played with enervating surliness by Jason Schwartzman, is not really a sympathetic protagonist, so the eccentric characters surrounding him do not really have anything that distinct with whom to bounce their extreme behavior. As the mind-bending duo Vivian and Bernard, Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman (with an unflattering Emo Philips haircut) are as comically delightful as the script allows them to be, as they snoop to find the greater meaning of Albert's situation and spout their banal universe-is-a-blanket philosophy without irony. Their nemesis is Caterine Vauban, played with awkward remoteness by revered French actress Isabelle Huppert, who really doesn't seem like she knows what she's saying.

Caught between the adversarial philosophies is not only Albert but also Tommy Corn, an oil-hating, post-9/11-traumatized firefighter who sides with Vauban's belief that everything is meaningless; Brad Stand, the corporate climber who caves into his own shallowness; and Dawn Campbell, the Huckabees model spokesperson inevitably coupled with Brad but finding her own inner self as an Amish handmaiden complete with bonnet, overalls and dirty teeth. Mark Wahlberg plays Tommy in his familiar roughhewn manner; Jude Law struggles with a non-descript American accent as he convincingly plays the conniving golden boy Brad gone to seed; and Naomi Watts makes Dawn as air-headed and unfulfilled as her character proves to be.  These characters have a meltdown in one form or another, and that's about the only connective theme in the plot. Otherwise there is really no conclusion to derive from the shenanigans Russell has set up here and consequently no emotional pay-off. There are some interesting cameo appearances in the film - the still-great looking Tippi Hedren as the head of the effort to save the marsh; Talia Shire (Schwartzman's real mother) as Albert's cold-fish mother; Jean Smart as a religious zealot mother who has ""adopted"" the African that Albert has been tracing; and even country superstar Shania Twain, the subject of Brad's ongoing schmooze story about the perils of eating chicken salad.

There is a lot of smart dialogue here, but it sputters by so fast and without apparent purpose that I couldn't appreciate most of it. But what the movie lacks the most is the heart in its title as Russell seems carried away by his cleverness and his thwarted attempts to concoct a cerebral screwball farce. Nice try but it doesn't work. The single edition DVD has audio commentary by Russell, as well as some contributions form Schwartzman, Wahlberg and Watts. While it helps to hear Russell's point in creating scenes and reinforcing the messages he is trying to convey here on existentialism, it's also a chore to make such connections as you're watching the movie. It certainly didn't interest me in getting the second disc of the special edition package.",1116720000,8,4073,5.280864197530864
2195362,4,B0006TPE4M,"David O. Russell's I HEART HUCKABEES is, I think, a real original: an unironic comedic attempt at exploring the meaning of our existence in this world. It's not a totally successful experiment. Its biggest flaw is its occasional preachiness: a little less sheer talk might have gone a long way. (And yet, I think this movie is much more stimulating than Richard Linklater's visually interesting but frankly rather boring WAKING LIFE.) And ultimately, I'm not sure if I HEART HUCKABEES, for all its intelligence and ambition, adds up to much more than ""life is a rollercoaster ride that is worth riding"" in the end.

Still, I HEART HUCKABEES is so defiantly original, so committed to working out its existential themes right on the screen, and so  strange, that it's worth seeing simply to experience the ride. The plot---such as it is---is a muddled mess, and its themes don't necessarily converge to make for a satisfying whole. But, for all its flaws, the movie will certainly leave you with something  to think about---perhaps, whether you believe your existence ultimately has meaning in the grand scheme of things.

It is a movie where you have to pay attention to get and understand everything, including the comic and existential overtones, but I like quirky films like this.  It kind of reminded me of some of the movies from the 60's that address existentialism.  Something you don't see talked about too much in society today.

As the commentary notes, people don't really want to think about their existence today except in the form of ""what is the solution.""  Our society has really embraced so many things that quiet any higher thought in this area, but I feel optimistic that things come full circle and old and new thoughts will be addressed once again.  That's my 2 cents, anyway.

As for the cast, this ensemble was outstanding and it was nice to see actors do comedy where it really is not their usual genre.  I really liked the interactions of Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman as ""existential detectives.""

I guess that the makers of these movie were going for a comedy but it is more like a really annoying melodrama.

The apparently selfless idealist turns out to be a self-promoting megalomaniac, while the one embodying evil interests ends up a victim.

Two recommendations for enjoying this movie, especially if you decide to buy the DVD:  First, watch it a first time with a totally open mind, enjoying each scene as it appears and not expecting anything to make sense.  Let the ideas and pieces of it float around in your mind for a few days, then watch it a second time focusing on the plot, and oualla...it's all connected and it all makes sense!

This movie is an example of a successful philosophical comedy, presenting all sorts of complex, abstract ideas in an enjoyable, open way without being pedantic or didactic, kind of like Woody Allen at its best. It's amazing that such great actors signed up for it (their pay must not have been anything close to what their accustomed to) and that despite the pressures to follow the tried and tired Hollywood formulas,  new experiments still get made and succeed.",1116028800,6,1500,4.809338521400778

First we are introduced to the idea that all life is interconnected and that we should let go of our painful attachments. This is probably inspired in eastern philosophy. Second we are presented with the ideas of existencialism. These consist in beliveing that nothing makes sense in this world and that it's not worth to fight for anyhing.

Apparently there are a lot of people who were able to read this film, something that I found difficult.  Of course I was somewhat distracted trying to decide if it was Jude Law or Freddie Prinze Jr. as the corporate PR guy (very scary resemblance).

Since this is an adult version of ""Harriet the Spy"", those who liked that film as kids might have had an advantage when processing their first viewing of ""Huckabees"". The themes of friendship, accommodation, and perseverance are central to both films and in both films it is necessary to sort through a lot of other stuff before it becomes clear what the film is trying to show us.

(Along with ""Harriet"") ""Chinatown"" and ""Casablanca"" influenced ""Huckabees"" message and style. Like ""Chinatown"" the events revolve around a detective's office and the audience stays a few steps behind the narrative. And like ""Casablanca"" a background of ordinary events serves as a stage for the discussion and attempted resolution of very significant issues. The title is a metaphor, ""Huckabees"" is a Walmart-like store whose ubiquitousness is turning the country into a strip mall. Since little girls in Third World countries are going blind supplying product for the store, shopping at Huckabees is to blind oneself to injustice. Meaning that we face a moral choice of choosing to recognize the truth and live in a state of guilt and paralysis or ignore the truth and exist inside a bright lie that would almost be perfect-except we must shut down our brains to maintain the illusion. The latter state illustrated by those driving SUV's who expressed surprise and outrage over the events of 9/11.

The message is that apparent reality is not the total reality and how limited we are in our ability to understand any of it (insert ""Mona Lisa Smile"" here). Another of the themes is that you must give up a little to get a little, that ego prevents us from connecting.

In retrospect it is amazing that the film was ever made and that it was made with a relatively large ($20MM) budget.  Comparing what is on the screen to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (made for a fraction of the money),  it is hard to see where the $20MM went, except to pay the name cast who probably would have worked for free on this as a labor of love.  It must have been obvious from the beginning that ""Huckabees"" would lose money.

It was also obvious that the film would fail in delivering its ambitious message.  Not because it is poorly written, but because the material is too complicated for the medium.  Which makes this a good time to praise the commentary sections that are on most recent DVD's.  DVD commentaries's are the most revolutionary film-making development since sound.  They give directors and screenwriters a footnote device that encourages multiple viewings and allows them to help audiences read their films.  Since only a fraction of viewers utilize this feature, it has not yet changed the way a film is shot and assembled, so at least for the short term there is no downside.  There are two commentaries on the ""I &#9829; Huckabees"" DVD and they are essential to appreciating this film.  So much so that those who missed seeing it in theaters might have been fortunate because now they will have quick access to this resource.

Although David Russell pokes fun at how we take ourselves too seriously, he is also trying to reach us with a message that will help us keep life in a better-balanced perspective and keep us aggressively examining everything we discover in the process of living.  This message element was a much more important motivation to him than the satire element.

What makes the Huckabees' parody unique is that none of the philosophical positions are actually absurdist (all are worthy of consideration) or even particularly exaggerated, the fun comes from the characters' total conviction that only their ideas are correct.  And what saves this thing from being the most pretentious film of all time is that Russell does not plug any concept other than keeping an open mind.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1114387200,3,4162,4.822784810126582
2195378,3,B0006TPE4M,"I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying this movie, mostly because Russell did his upmost to keep the viewer off guard, throwing in some wildly absurdist scenes and turning many situations on their head, but I can't say I was satisfied with this movie in the end.  It is interesting to see how Mark Wahlberg has grown as an actor.  Hard to believe this is the same guy who used to model Calvin Klein underwear.  I'm not so impressed with Jason Schwartzman in his best role since Rushmore.  Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman were great as the existential detectives, but Jude Law is Jude Law.  He doesn't change from film to film.  I've grown quickly tired of his Brilliantine screen presence.

While the film shrouded itself in the ""big idea,"" it never really delivered.  It ended up parodying most of the ideas in threw out, too afraid, it seems, to make any stand.  In the end we are left with the trite middle road as the answer to whether it is fate or happenstance that controls our actions, with a warm embrace all the way around.  The film seemed to talk itself out, as the characters seemed to be literally gasping for air after all their rapid-fire banter.

Jason Schwartzman, Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Naomi Watts, Isabelle Huppert, Mark Wahlberg, Jude Law---the cast is simply magnificent, perfectly cast and directed by David Russel, whose iconoclastic work includes the equally ballsy ""Three Kings.""

Any retard can put together a Hollywood crowd-pleaser that relies on either a lot of hype and special effects (read: computer animation) or a lot of hype and comforting/""uplifting"" cliches (e.g. ""Titanic"").  This is what we're used to, and this is what we get 90% of the time.

""I Heart Huckabees"" is one of those rare films that's squarely about ideas---in this case, a lot of Buddhist metaphysics which, admittedly, viewers who've never been exposed to Eastern philosophy may well find bewildering and/or bizarre.  Its genius lies in its effectiveness as a totally unpredictable comedy of the absurd (which is how Buddhists view most of human life) that is often dancing on the edge of inscrutability, but is nevertheless both hilarious and fascinating even if you don't fully ""get"" the philosophical underpinnings.

The scene of Huppert and Schwartzmann frolicking in the mud is by itself worth the price of the DVD!  Just drop-dead gorgeous.  An instant classic!

You will notice that those who enjoyed the movie will warn you that it is not likely to be to everyone's taste. Those who did not like the movie, on the other hand, will tell you that it was a bad film. There are films that are simply bad, to be sure. However, I suspect that the truth of the matter here is that, for the most part, these people simply misunderstood it. This not meant to be a serious film about life's big questions. It is a piss-take on a certain area of philosophy that has received a great deal of attention in literary academics and the mass media, but is widely discredited by philosophers, especially in the English-speaking world.

Contra some comments here, the film is in no way pretentious. What some have seen as pretention, is entirely intended, and for those who recognise it as such, is very funny. The film is reasonably cereberal at times, but don't try to find any real meaning or insight in the dialogue--perhaps there is some deep message in the film as a whole, but this is hardly uncommon, and has little if anything to do with the seudo-philosophy contained in the film.

If this sounds like fun to you, it probably will be. But, either way, this is a good film, and it achieves exactly what it sets out to achieve.

I should probably fess-up and admit I am a graduate student in philosophy (and in particular the sort of philosophy that derides the type parodied in this film) and so this film is of particualr interest to me. However, I feel that this film is likely to appeal to anyone who has a decent head on their shoulders and a sense of humor--whether you prefer Russell, Heidegger, or have never heard of either of them.",1113782400,2,1839,4.387096774193548

It seems just the type of faux intellectual dribble ( and lots of it) that Tomlin and Hoffman might jump at with the chance of connecting with younger audiences.  Both are well known vets of some of America's classics (Nashville, The Graduate), but the actors seem thrown into the parts of existential detectives, like dogs without a bone- existential lyrics no doubt.  The point here is that the script attempts to discuss existential theory and ends up being a tiring jumble of asides and tangents that serve not to enhance, but only to confuse the scenes.  The breastfeeding scene is obviously meant to provide shock value and serves as a grotesque element, not disconnected from the story, but not augmenting its telling either.  I rate this movie low because it is rather insulting to the avid literary movie goer looking for a good story with meaning and universal appeal.

The movie stars Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin as ""existential detectives"" hired by Jason Schwartzman to find out why he has ""coincidentally"" ran into the same individual on three separate occasions.

At the same time, Schwartzman is in a battle to save the planet (wetlands and forests) from useless corporate developments (i.e. Huckabees). Jude Law is Jason's corporate nemesis, who's vying to overtake Jason's ""Open Spaces"" environmental protection group with the help of corporate songstress, Shania Twain, who appears in a cameo role as herself.

Oh, and by the way, Mark Wahlberg is also featured in this film as a disgruntled fireman who is adamantly against all petroleum products and has also employed the services of Hoffman and Tomlin. Sound confusing? Well it is.

The movie veers off in fourteen different directions, and is not for everyone. However, if you have an open mind and are into movies that are really off the wall, go ahead and rent this movie. I guarantee you have not seen anything like it.

2195388,3,B0006TPE4M,"By me, quirky is good. So is comedy. ""I Heart Huckabees"" is a quirky comedy, which deals with existentialism, nihilism and the search for Truth. Well, the cast is outstanding, anyway, if existentialism and nihilism don't grab your attention, and you don't need any more Truth in your life. I loved this film...and I hated it. Talk about philosophical ambivalence! The movie's premise is hilarious, absurd, very intelligent, and too esoteric. It does not succeed in bringing forth much laughter...from me anyway, although there are some outstanding comedic vignettes. How could there not be with Lilly Tomlin in the cast? The satire is good, and one doesn't necessarily have to respond to irony with belly laughs in order to appreciate it. I just found myself looking at my watch half-way through ""Huckabees"" - not a good sign. I didn't exactly want to turn off my DVD player, but at times I felt like it. Sorry if I am not being very helpful here. Let me be more specific, unlike the film.

Young Albert Markovsky, (Jason Schwartzman), is an environmental activist, a local leader and the founder of the Open Spaces Coalition, an organization dedicated to fighting ""urban sprawl."" He is also a serious poet (?), who fervently believes he can reach the public through his art. In one scene, the environmentalists have succeeded in saving one single rock in an extensive wetlands, which are about to be destroyed. One of the lines in Albert's celebratory poem reads, ""You rock, rock."" His personal nemesis is Huckabees, a chain of stores which sells all things to everyone, and in order to expand perpetually, destroys the natural world - wildlife, trees, and swamps. Their agenda is to build more malls and parking lots for easier access to their customers. Brad Stand, (Jude Law), is an up-and-coming sales exec, who personifies Huckabees. Albert hates him. Brad adores himself, is infatuated with his own charisma and is followed almost everywhere by his groveling staff - who hope to move upward and onward with this 'young Turk.' He takes an ""if you can't beat them, join them"" approach to the environmentalists. Representing Corporate America, he embraces the activists' cause, arranges for Huckabees, (through him), to co-sponsor a benefit starring Shania Twain, and other celebs, and quickly has the environmentalists enamored of him and his ideas, while they step all over Albert's sincere efforts and sneer at his poems. Of course Brad plans to pay little more than lip service to Open Spaces' and the environmental issues they represent. He is not gonna deliver. But there will be a benefit with the media lauding Huckabees as a major supporter of Mother Earth.

Albert is depressed, and on top of his low spirits, he is obsessed by a coincidence. He runs into the same stranger, a Sudanese refugee, three times in a few days - in totally different settings. He believes there is a cosmic meaning behind the random encounters. By chance, he finds a business card which advertises a firm specializing in Existential Detective Crisis Investigation and Resolution, run by existential detectives Bernard Jaffe, (Dustin Hoffman), and his wife Vivian, (Lily Tomlin). He wants them to discover the meaning behind these coincidences. They want him to discover the meaning of life. The couple believes, optimistically, that everything and everyone are connected. They follow Albert 24/7, documenting all that he does, in order to ""figure out his true situation and assist him to resolve his crisis."" He is also hooked up with another man, troubled firefighter Tommy Corn, (Mark Wahlberg), who has not been the same since the ""September thing,"" and rides his motorcycle to fires because he is fiercely anti-petroleum. They are to provide one another with support.

La belle Isabelle Huppert plays Caterine, who was once a protege of Tomlin's and Hoffman's but has taken an opposite philosophy - that nothing is connected and life is basically ""random, meaningless and cruel."" She too follows Albert, documenting his behavior to prove her theory is the correct one. Then Brad gets into the act and becomes a client of the Existential Detectives, as does his girlfriend Naomi Watts, model and spokesperson for Huckabees.

Director David O. Russell deserves kudos for taking on such a philosophical, almost grandiose project. The actors, some of the best, deserve credit for participating in a risky endeavor. Russell makes some excellent points about the conflicts human beings face at the dawn of the 21st century. The film is intelligent, well acted and directed, interesting, filled with irony and satire - but it doesn't quite work. It becomes too tedious, especially after 105 minutes. There is little action, and lots of surreal dialogue - but it is not taut, it all just sprawls...as in urban. Now, I am not exactly a mainstream moviegoer, but I don't really know if I was entertained or not. Is there cosmic meaning with my dissatisfaction with ""I Heart Huckabees?"" Why is the film not called ""I Luv Huckabees?"" When we see tee-shirts that say ""I Heart NY,"" we know it means ""I Luv NY."" What does ""I heart"" mean?

This is a movie that one either loves, or hates - except for me. I can't seem to make up my mind, so I am waffling with a 3 Star rating.

Part of the subtext of the movie seemed to pit the overly sunny optimism of the American perspective (Hoffman/Tomlin) against the overly glum, pessimism of the Euro-perspective (Huppert).  It seemed odd to me, however, that Huppert was presented as a student of Hoffman & Tomlin, when the history of the these perspectives would imply more of siblings-reared-separately kind of relationship.

The suggestion here (stated explicitly by Schwartzmann's character) is that neither perspective is adequate, but rather a blending of the two is what will really give meaning to your life.  In other words, the movie is saying that clinging to one end of an ideological pole will not get you anywhere.  Well, bravo.

The direction and production of the film were a good deal of fun to watch most of the time.  Everyone seems to be running everywhere in this movie and the setting in non-descript areas of post-modern Los Angeles was apropos.

This film doesn't really take itself seriously, but it's hard for me not to take IT seriously.

The narrative is fairly free-form, but it makes a lot more sense on the second viewing, once you are familiar with it's logic and theme.  It's different.  It does have a similar sense of humor as Being John Malkovich and Royal Tenenbaums.  Perhaps we're in a renaissance of intelligent and thought-provoking comedies.  And who says all American films are crap these days?

Mark Wahlberg turns in a brilliant performance as an angry and disillusioned firefighter.  All the leads are really great actually.  They represent different facets of humanity.  The central duality of the two main characters is the crux that drives the plot.  Jude Law represents callous industrialism, (""progress""), while Jason Schwartzmann is idealistic altruism (""earth first"").  As the film says, we are all one and so are the two main characters.

What do you do after you see ""I Heart Huckabees?""  I couldn't go to sleep without writing something down, trying to make sense of what I had just seen.  If you accept the challenge of this film, if you don't schluf it off as an ""audacious mess"" as the Amazon critic wrote, you may be rewarded, but it could weigh heavy on your mind.

Well, this has been a rambling review.  As someone posted on IMDB, all existentialism did for Jean-Paul Sartre was make him confused and miserable his whole life, despite being brilliant, famous and beloved.

There are some who will watch this film and think, ""Wow, that really makes you think,"" but they are missing the point. The point is to see past all of the words and the talk and find that everything I Heart Huckabees says is nothing.

Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), the young director of an environmental organization called Open Spaces, hires a pair of existential detectives, Bernard and Vivian Jaffe (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin), to spy on himself. You see, he's looking for the meaning of it all, and he's had some strange coincidences lately that he thinks have some greater meaning, but then again, maybe they don't mean anything. But that's for the detectives to find out.

As the Jaffes investigate, they learn of a falling out between Albert and Brad Stand (Jude Law), an executive at Huckabees, ""The Everything Store,"" who has his own plans for Open Spaces, which involve using Shania Twain as a poster girl. Soon, Brad has hired Bernard and Vivian to work on his own case, but Albert believes that he's just trying to push him out of his own coalition. Brad thinks that Albert has an infatuation with his girlfriend, Dawn (Naomi Watts), who is the poster girl for Huckabees.

Meanwhile, Albert is introduced to his ""other"" (a sort of existential buddy system), Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), who is also being investigated by the Jaffes, but rejects their ideas that everything has a meaning and we are all a part of the same fabric. Instead, Tommy has been following the teachings of Caterine (Isabelle Huppert), who argues that nothing has any meaning and this is all just pointless. Albert gets swept up in this battle of everything versus nothing and hilarity ensues.

It sounds confusing, but it's all a ruse, you see. The whole point that writer-director David O. Russell is trying to make is that beneath all of the talk about why are we here and what is the meaning of life, there is really no basis, or maybe there's a greater meaning. Whatever the answer is, we'll never really know, so talking about it is ridiculous to begin with. It's quite brilliant actually, because a whole lot is said, but then again, nothing is said. It seems that everybody's talking, but who is saying anything?

Huckabees is full of hilarious banter and slapstick moments, and all of the performances are dead-on. All of the actors play the parts straight, which makes it even funnier. In the middle of a conversation about the infinite, Tommy chimes in, ""We're not in infinity, we're in the suburbs,"" and he means it. It's not funny to him, but it sure is to me. When Bernard says, ""There's no such thing as nothing,"" he really means it, but it doesn't actually mean anything. And that pretty much sums up this film.",1111536000,2,3001,4.719465648854962

Ok, this probably sounds too upbeat.  This was my experience.  I don't know what state of mind people were in when they hated it.  I do have to say, timing when you watch it could be key.  I am even wondering if my raving about it might not spoil it for my family's watching.  Maybe they could see it in a better time.

The existential humor was just awesome!  Dustin was unbelievable!  So satirical!  This is for me truly a satire that works! I didn't like the Royal Tenenbaums.  Adaptation was very thoughtful but nearly not as entertaining as this one. Eternal Sunshine, while a super movie, didn't click in my mind as much as Huckabees.  Mark Wahlberg was amazing and fresh and gorgeous in a very unpretentious way!  What a great actor!  Jude was greased, but that was his character, and he came out of his pretense, albeit shortly.  But Mark man... Lili Tomlin is the woman!  Her face is the epitome of comedy!

The subject matter can touch the heart if you let it to.  I have a feeling I will think more about the dialogue as my days proceed from now on.  If only this process of stripping away of our consciousness could work so fast!  That's why this movie is a comedy and not the true experience.  But I heart Huckabees is an amazing headway to the topic!  The scene with the religious family alone was worth it for me!

2195409,5,B0006TPE4M,"My favorite type of movie is something that will play with your mind. From Donnie Darko, to Butterfly Effect, Fight Club, Adaptation, so on and so forth. I was so happy when I first heard about this movie. It was an existential comedy, it was going to play with my mind and be funny at the same time, which is something that is rare to see in a movie thats designed to make you think.

During the first viewing there were little parts that I actually laughed at becuase I was trying really hard to pay attention to the philosophy that the movie was shoving down my throat. However, I realized that the humor was in how seriously these people took these ridiculous activities and philosophies. Also I saw a great deal of slapstick involved in the movie. From jumping into cars through an open back window, to running through sprinklers in an odd and unessesary manner, and of course splashing faces in the mud. Anyone who tries to take the following to seriously is missing the point, and thus the humor.

Overall this movie was great, it had some great outlooks on philosophy, and some funny moments too. Those who don't understand or try too hard to understand the quirks of this movie may be missing the whole picture.

Favorite line in the whole movie has to be, ""How am I not myself?"" The connotations that the line had for that character and everyone who watches the movie are greater than you could ever imagine. And the ingenious way in which the director/screenwriter has the other two characters repeat the line just so that the character will actually answer the question for himself. Just pure brilliance. Its a question we all need to answer for ourselves, because if we figure out how we are not ourselves we will then find out who we really are. Thought provoking, but funny to see, that is the essence of I ""Heart"" Huckabees.",1111104000,4,1840,4.569696969696969

It would help to know something about existential philosophy, buddhism and psychotherapy to ""get"" the film's references to those things.  While this might be off putting for some people there are lots of ways of ""getting"" the film, and lots of pleasures it offers.  Please don't let the subject matter's unfamiliarity stop you from seeing this.

2195411,5,B0006TPE4M,"I was actually on amazon trying to get the bibliography info for this movie to use it as a secondary source in the paper I'm currently writing about the social role that existentialism fulfills. I happened to spot a few revews and was both elated and let down. Although I should have perhaps expected a movie like this to recieve opposite ends of the star spectrum from various reviewers, my disheartenment came both from the ecstatic and dismal blurbs. Neither seemed to really capture the essence of what made this movie so beautiful. Personally, I had no option but go ahead and give it the 5-star rating. Why? Because both times I have viewed it, in the theatre and on dvd, I have been near the point of tears. I was literally so happy I wanted to cry. Putting aside the philosophy for a moment, lets get the technical issues out of the way. This movie had direction of the highest calibre in terms of character interaction. Big names don't always mesh, but the quirky cast for me was absolutely perfect. Perhaps not always the most stunning performances, but absolutely internally cohesive, and more importantly, extremely honest. In additon, the soundtrack fit the movie to a tee. For me, it was also the little scenes of nuance that really made it all work, like Hoffman and Tomlin dodging (unsuccesfully) the maze of sprinklers on the lawn of Law's suburban house. And then there was the philosophy. I admit I'm fully indoctrinated and preacher of existentialism, and thus as a result, perhaps did not have a problem with the subtle references made in the film. Maybe this resulted in my fuller enjoyment, but I hate to let it stand as that. Existentialism, unlike so many other philosophies, is at its core, about every day life. As a result, I was thrilled to see it actually put into an absurdly common setting, unlike what is perhaps somewhat the fallacy and alienating elements of ""The Stranger"", ""Waiting for Godot"", and many French existentialist films. This work made it accessible in a way I had never before seen. I saw another critic write that the French films do it better. I agree that they make French existentialist films better, but given the rarity today of existentialism in the American vocabulary, there is little in the way of standards in terms of American existentialist films. I Heart Huckabees seemed then to not only be attempting to expose the humanistism involved, but also working to backtrack for lost time. Only a concept so decorative and absurd as an ""existentialist detective"" organization could pull of the transition so blaringly in a truly American indie setting. I realize now that not everyone who has seen the film appreciates it, but I still think everyone should see it. Less for the film itself, but rather because in an American world of prescriptive victimization, I think many of us could do well with a healthy dose of self-speculation, especially when we can be assured of the absurdity it delivers. I would beg anyone reading the reviews without having seen the movie, to do yourself a favor and decide for yourself.

Yeah, I guess I have to say more. But really, that's all this boils down to. Being bored. You wait for something interesting to happen amid all this pretentious ""if there meaning to life"" babble talking, but all hope is in vain. The French make films like this all the time, pondering the meaning of our existence, getting philosophical. They do it better, mostly because they do it a lot. In American hands it just seems strained and forced, and the choice of actors is just ill advised.

2195415,4,B0006TPE4M,"When it was released theatrically, ""I Heart Huckabees"" was given a decidedly mixed response.  While some found its offbeat humor and deliberately confusing philosophy to be enjoyable, others were flabbergasted.  The film ended up being a box office disappointment, and it's easy to see why- this was certainly not something made for mainstream success (in fact, when I saw this in theaters, at least four people had walked out by the halfway point).  Why people would despise this movie while enjoying the obnoxiously dumb summer blockbusters (OK, some are enjoyable) is beyond me.  My only guess is people hated this movie because they ""didn't get it.""  The point is, that's kind of the point.

""I Heart Huckabees"" dives incredibly deep into two competing types of philosophy, and neither is very comprehensible except at the basic level.  I believe that the filmmakers did not intend for the ideas in this movie to be taken seriously, and that it was funny the characters in the film did so.  If you're willing to accept that most of the ""big ideas"" in this movie are inane and meaningless, then you will likely find yourself enjoying it.

The movies works because it never loses sight of the fact that it's a comedy (one thing that drove me crazy about ""Life Aquatic"" was that it took an inherently silly concept and tried to squeeze drama out of it).  While there aren't many laugh-out-loud moments in ""Huckabees,"" there are plenty of chuckles and grins.  Mark Wahlberg in particular is amusing as a petroleum-obsessed firefighter, and his ""ball thing"" scene is a classic.  The other actors all aquaint themselves nicely to their roles- Jason Schwartzman makes for a funny lead, while Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin are given a chance to let loose their comedic sides.  Only Jude Law irritates, partly because he's been given a phony American accent here (compare this to his superior one in ""Road to Perdition"").

""I Heart Huckabees"" worked for me overall.  True, director David O. Russel does not strike the gold that he did with ""Three Kings,"" but he isn't aiming that high, to be fair.  What ""Huckabees"" is good for is a night of laughs, provided that you're willing to think a little and accept the absurdity of everything.",1110672000,2,2232,4.865079365079365

It just wasn't funny enough to be a successful satire. I laughed perhaps three times, and they were only chuckles. I'm not an ignorant person. I've studied philosophy (thought of taking it up as a minor in undergrad), so I understood what they were trying to do. But...well...I guess I'm just repeating myself here, so there's not much more I can say other than it wasn't funny enough, and that it didn't work for me.

2195418,5,B0006TPE4M,"As a good friend (and philosophy graduate student) of mine put it: ""This movie takes all of 20th century existentialism and wraps it up into a pop joke for two hours.""  Thank you to all the reviewers who found it in themselves to relax and enjoy the movie instead of being angry at it for using big words.  The movie is not meant to reveal the meaning of life to the audience, nor is it meant to make some overwhelming profound statement.  Instead, it gives a lesson that all of us can benefit from--that in the search for value in life, it is not wise to swallow someone else's perspective whole, and that value is not to be found all neatly typed up in some book or neatly summed up from someone else's mouth.

This movie manages to be highly enjoyable, extremely funny, and challenging and thought-provoking all at once.  That is not an easy amalgam to achieve, and the movie deserves all the more credit for that.  It saddens me that many reviewers found they could not relate to the characters, because all the characters are doing is critically assessing their lives, challenging traditional notions, and looking for more out of life--something we should all be doing constantly.

My advice: stop expecting the movie to be some magnificent revelation, and sit back and enjoy it.  Learn from the characters' methods, not necessarily the content.  The ones who ended up frustrated with this movie were the ones who frantically sought deep meaning in it where there was only satire and good fun.  There are many fascinating and philosophical concepts to ponder upon the movie's end, but the movie is not trying to spoon-feed us the existentialist perspective.  Instead, the audience gets to watch the characters grapple with these important ideas, and we should be inspired to do the same while having a good laugh.

The cast is great (Mark Wahlburg gives his best performance yet) and the premise is cool.  It's the comedy that doesn't quite flow.  It has some hilarious moments (mostly involving Wahlburg) but too many that don't work.  I did enjoy the movie, and it does make you think about thinking.

2195420,5,B0006TPE4M,"Reading through the reviews of other Amazon.com customers, I realize that the majority of those who gave I Heart Huckabees a one- or two-star rating simply didn't understand the film. Yes, it is very much an ""existential comedy"", as stated on the cover, however, it does get somewhat mind-boggling (in a good way) in some of the more meaningful parts.

There are two types of people who could possibly like this movie; those who like darker, obscure comedies, or those who prefer movies that require some contemplation post-viewing. Being a person who qualifies for both of those labels, I felt I Heart Huckabees was easliy one of the best movies of 2004. Not only is the acting superb, but the concept for the movie is actually quite brilliant as well.

To give away the plot of the movie is to ruin the entire point, so I won't drone on about what the majority of the other reviews do; however, I suggest watching this movie with no distractions as one can get very pulled-in by the inherent philisophical conflict. Yes, the plot can be somewhat overwhelming and confusing at the beginning, however the end product resulting from the initial confusion is well worth it.

Again, I can't specifically say what the plot involves, however Jason Schwartzman, Mark Wahlberg, and Lilly Tomlin are easily my choices for the top actors within the movie, however I didn't dislike any of the other actors by any means (however Jude Law's quasi-accent-concealing American drawl is not the best...). If you are a fan of more obscure, darker comedies (like The Royal Tenenbaums or even Death to Smoochy), and have the ability to sit through the film while contemplating a lot of the internal concepts, then I Heart Huckabees will most likely become one of your favorite movies.

Jason Schwartzman is the lead character, a hapless environmental activist who seems to be more interested in reading his bad poetry than organizing his fellow activists.  Perplexed by a seeming coincidence involving multiple encounters with a stranger, he visits existential detectives played by Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin.  They believe in the total interconnectness of the universe and promise to find Schwartzman's place in it.  Jude Law, Naomi Watts and Mark Wahlberg are also thrown into the mix as people directly or indirectly involved in Schwartzman's live.  I'd try to explain how, but the whole thing is a big mess and not worth further clarification.

The lack of any real sympathetic characters, the ludicrous story and the unnecessary weirdness make this an almost completed failed effort.  There is some humor, however, to offer a little redemption, and it does not have the pure awfulness that a one-star film merits.

This was another weird, ""thinking man's"" type comedy. I will admit that with the humor being so dry, sometimes it is hard to realize that they are in fact making jokes. Movies that are on somewhat of an even keel would be The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic. That is not to say that if you did not enjoy those you will not like I Heart Huckabees either.

The cast was very good; including but not limited to Jason Schwartzman, Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Naomi Watts, Mark Wahlberg, Jude Law and Isabelle Huppert.

The basic premise is Jason Schwartzman's character being caught in the middle of a feud between existentialism and nihilism as his life begins to spiral out of control. He simply seeks the meaning of his ""coincidence"". He has had three sightings of the same doorman around town. He wants to know the significance. That is why he seeks out the detectives. Along the way, the detectives attempt to address his battle with Jude Law's character. Isabelle Huppert plays a French author who teaches the opposite end of the spectrum from Hoffman and Tomlin. Is it that we are all the same? Or is it that we are all nothing and all that exists is chaos?

""How am I not myself?"" The movie follows a few characters as they ask some pretty hard hitting questions.

2195426,3,B0006TPE4M,"""I Heart Huckabees"" is a screwball comedy for the early 21st Century. Director David O. Russell, whose ""Three Kings"" is one of my favorite movies, tries valiantly to update the genre but ultimately fails in his attempt. This doesn't mean that it isn't funny, which it often is, or that a small group of hardcore fans won't make it a cult classic one day. I simply feel that its deficits outweigh its assets.

Albert [Jason Schwartzman] is a key member of an environmentalist group which is trying to save a wetland. Brad [Jude Law], a PR man for Huckabees, a Target-like department store chain, understands that it would be good for the corporation's image to hook up with the group. All sorts of mayhem follows, including Albert's loss of identity. He resorts to a pair of Existentialist detectives [Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin] to help him to `find' himself. [So much for plot. Screwball comedies are not about plot, anyway!]

The movie is a send up of corporate sponsorship, media events, shallow relationships, existentialism and quantum physics, among other things. In these areas it succeeds brilliantly. Where it fails is in providing any warmth to the characters. In the classic screwball comedies of the 1930s, the satire and the ridiculousness succeeded, in part, because the characters were delightful and loveable. The audience was right there with them. In ""I Heart Huckabees"", Russell chooses an almost clinical approach. The characters exist in a bubble, which makes them hard to relate to.",1109894400,2,1508,5.028

This reviewer says it all - if you love eccentric, absurdist comedies a la Charlie Kaufman (Human Nature, Eternal Sunshine) and enjoy the quirky, affectionate comedy of Wes Anderson (Bottle Rocket, Tenenbaums), you will LOVE this movie! If, on the other hand, you prefer a good Vin Diesel action flick or a romantic comedy, don't even think about it.

The film keeps you so humorously entertained that you don't notice all the existential discourse that's trickling down your throat. Not surprising from the writer/director of the hilariously goofy and smart ""Flirting with Disaster"". Some viewers found the overtalking distancing, I thought it was razor-sharp and oddly effortless in its artificiality. And it's funny as hell. Self-examination has never been so painless! Not as emotionally affecting or profound as it could have been, but more spiritual and heartfelt than any philosophy movie has a right to be (not just inane, heady banter). Take it from an ex-philosophy student who spent years debating the existence of ""somethingness"" vs. ""nothingness"" (as in the film)! Although purists be forewarned - this is philosophy for the masses.
It takes actors this good to make such a rollicking, almost non-coherent plot into a such a riveting piece of entertainment... Jude Law's performance is phenomenally unrecognizable, as is Mark Wahlberg in a stunning thespian tour-de-force (who knew he could act?), and old reliables like Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin prove they are anything but stale. If you call yourself a pseudo- (or better yet, post-) intellectual who doesn't heart Hollywood's recycled premises, this one's for you!

Not surprising from the writer/director of the hilariously goofy and smart ""Flirting with Disaster"". Some viewers found the overtalking distancing, I thought it was razor-sharp and oddly effortless in its artificiality. And it's funny as hell. Self-examination has never been so painless! Not as emotionally affecting or profound as it could have been, but more spiritual and heartfelt than any philosophy movie has a right to be (not just inane, heady banter). Take it from an ex-philosophy student who spent years debating the existence of ""somethingness"" vs. ""nothingness"" (as in the film)! Although purists be forewarned - this is philosophy for the masses.
It takes actors this good to make such a rollicking, almost non-coherent plot into a such a riveting piece of entertainment... Jude Law's performance is phenomenally unrecognizable, as is Mark Wahlberg in a stunning thespian tour-de-force (who knew he could act?), and old reliables like Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin prove they are anything but stale. If you call yourself a pseudo- (or better yet, post-) intellectual who doesn't heart Hollywood's recycled premises, this one's for you!
They just don't make enough of these movies for us brain-starved ex-intellectuals... <sigh>",1109721600,,2083,5.373088685015291
2195431,5,B0006TPE4M,"I didn't have high hopes for this film, but wound up enjoying it quite a bit. It's a lighthearted, giddy send-up of the central philosopical dilemma of the post-Holocaust 20th Century: what, if any system of belief can get us through the despair-laden times we find ourselves in:  Individualism? Nihilism? Consumerism? Loopy, goopy New Age-y, I-Am-You-As-You-Are-Me-And-We-Are-All-Together-ism? This film is kooky and uber-hip, but it doesn't quite devolve into the same sort of empty, smug, self-important absurdism as such tediously ""ironic"" films such as ""Royal Tennenbaums"" and ""Rushmore,"" with which it will inevitably be linked... While *those* films can legitimately be pegged as vaccuous, tedious minor works, sham spectacles that have no center, ""Huckabee's"" is different.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't seem to demand knowing adulation from its audience, yet it does offer real intellectual fodder, albeit in a Cliff Notes-ish, pop culture-y form that has just enough substance to it that your mind may be tickled towards introspection, yet not so much that you feel lectured at and bored to death.  The films I'd most readily compare it to are ""Garden State"" and ""Repo Man...""

There IS a meaning in life but you have to crawl out of yourself to find it, so the zippered-up blanket the characters hide in is highly appropriate.

Philosophy, crudeness, and strange imagery surround this film; some good, some not.  For example, the opening statement is just a blurb of profanity, but of course this is theoretically supposed to have meaning.

Now I did find this film to be rather humorous.  Dustin Hoffman and Tomlin were great as the snooping existentialists.  My only problem has to do really with the plot.  What's the point?  I understand this is somehow a reaction to 9/11, and if so then I understand the director or writer have something more deeply, and personally involved.  However, it seemed more like an extended ""Whose Line"" skit (with the humor at parts.)

Understandably there wasn't time for more, but I believe that would have helped.  Also, and later in life this won't be a problem, Jude Law has just been in too many films this year (2004) and well, this is just another one too many.

2195434,4,B0006TPE4M,"I Heart Huckabees is a strange movie. After satirically skewering the U.S.' involvement in the first Gulf War with Three Kings, David O. Russell took some time off to regroup and recover after a grueling shoot. He returned with a vengeance last year with one of the most challenging movies to be backed by a major studio in recent years. Calling it an absurdist comedy doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of this complex movie.

I Heart Huckabees is in the same absurdist tradition of Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud or the little seen Elliot Gould film, Little Murders. Like these movies, Huckabees follows its own internal logic and assumes that the audience will stick with the film even if they don't understand what exactly is happening or why. This is definitely a movie that requires repeated viewings if only to absorb all of the ideas that it examines and the questions that is poses.

Huckabees gleefully thumbs its nose at conventional narrative filmmaking by being a philosophical comedy that throws out a lot of fascinating ideas and asks a lot of interesting questions. As the characters struggle with weighty issues so the film struggles with weighty themes. Whether either is successful is left up the viewer to decide. If you come away from Huckabees thinking about a couple of them then this film has done its job.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director David O. Russell. He elaborates on what we are watching which helps if you are mystified by this movie.

The second commentary features Russell again, this time joined by Schwartzman and Wahlberg with Naomi Watts edited in separately. Schwartzman recounts amusing anecdotes about making the movie and keeps things light. Russell's comments tend to overlap somewhat from his solo track.",1109548800,3,1774,5.003389830508475

It comes off as Russells personal sandbox where two competing philosphies duke it out only to cancel each other out at the end, changing essentially nothing.  It tries to dazzle you with drive-by philosophy and kooky characters but ultimately is just a meandering mix of slightly connected scenes that drag you along to the end.",1109462400,2,552,5.25

2195437,5,B0006TPE4M,"While many film enthusiasts may enjoy this film, the most likely predictor that someone will like ""I Heart Huckabees"" is an appreciation for existential literature.  This film follows the tradition of the play ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"" a classic example of absurdist drama.  While many perceive the lack of fluidity and maze of philosophical references to be a downfall of the film--calling it poor or pretentious writing--this style is actually probably as relevent to the movie as the characters or the lines themselves are.  Plot is inconsequential in absurdist drama, and exaggerated and ridiculous events and characters are exactly what make absurdist drama ""absurd.""  The film also echoes more famous examples of existentialism, such as ""Waiting for Godot"" or Sartre's works.

At the same time, ""I Heart Huckabees"" is full of humor and charm that anyone could appreciate.  The acting is superb, and the one-liners are classic.  Not everyone will love or even necessarily like this film, but by no means does the audience have to be familiar with existentialism or any other philosophical theories to appreciate the film.  In fact, with the humor and absurdity surrounding the characters, the film is in many ways a farce ridiculing existentialism and other lofty philosophies.  It only helps to know that the disjointedness and peculiarity of the plot are intentional, and not a result of clumsy writing or childish whim of imagination.",1109376000,8,1457,5.2727272727272725

If that sounds too exhausting for you, don't bother - rent Vin Diesel's X-X-X instead, or something similar - that's probably much closer to your style.

2195439,5,B0006TPE4M,"I &#9829;Huckabees is a nearly unparalleled delight.  I resisted all the hype and then the disappointment by friends who saw it in the theatre and waited to purchase this special 2 DVD set.  I hesitantly put it on and within minutes found myself in the middle of a movie I never wanted to end.  Ever.

Combining a number of existential principles (lightly) at polar opposites we are given the by the proponents of each in the wife and husband team of Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffmann (who believe everything in the universe to be connected) and sexy French nihilist, Isabelle Huppert (who espouses nothing is connected and life is only ugly pain/drama followed by the bliss of complete nothingness.)  The resolution at film's end is something of an inevitable revelation that had been threatening to occur throughout the film and director David Russell holds off releasing this delicious orgasmic bit for as long as possible.

Tomlin and Hoffman's  ""clients"" come to them in different ways.  Jason Schwartzman a young environmentalist idealist out to save the world, Mark Wahlberg, a disillusioned fireman with his own environmental (and myriad other) issues, Jude Law and girlfriend Naomi Watts, vain, take-no-prisoners types who would stop at nothing in their climbing of the social ladder.  The journey of the soul each of them takes is unique, remarkable, hilarious and touching.

While the multiple special effects throughout the film seem judiciously used only to further the storylines, there is no denying the hypnotic eye-candy effect they achieve, and damn are they fun!

The performance of every member of this magnificent acting ensemble is something to cherish. Lily Tomlin looks terrific and has never been fresher - she's an underrated American treasure and here gives a comic performance balanced, nuanced and assured, whether dodging sprinklers, diving through car windows, on bicycle chases or otherwise racing around (and always in high heels!).  Hoffmann is her perfect movie match and he and Tomlin's respect and affection for each other (sharing kisses at seemingly inappropriate times) feels genuine and as a team they are simply remarkable.

Mark Wahlberg has developed into a very special actor and the levels of anger, hurt, frustration, confusion and revelation his character undergoes never once have a false ring.  His performance is nearly perfect and encapsulated with grace and delicate comic timing.  Who'd have thought he'd become THIS?

Isabelle Huppert's cold, clinical and oh-so-very-French foil to Hoffmann/Tomlin is almost too much.  Her presence felt early on when she finally bursts in ""for real"" in the story she nearly walks away with it.

Jason Schwartzman's Albert is the heart and soul of the movie and with whom we're seemingly most supposedly to identify with.  This isn't at all difficult given his committed, fully thought out performance.  Though Wahlberg's Tommy Corn is Albert's ""Other"" (as in self, half, spiritual etc.) Albert must connect with every other character and he does so, splendidly.

The calming dnouement is achieved following a near orgy of out-of-control emotions, self-discovery, acceptance and growth that is nearly overwhelming.  I'm not ashamed to say that as hard as I laughed throughout Huckabees, there were tears in my eyes at the end.  It is a beautiful, madcap, enlightening journey of self-discovery and Russell clearly wants everyone to enjoy the ride.

The Bonus Disc is (literally) hours of fun, particularly the extended/deleted scenes and the Naomi Watts faux commercial spots for Huckabees ""Your EVERYTHING Store""

There is not a missed beat or false note throughout I &#9829;Huckabees and David O. Russell more than fulfills the expectations he made with his trio of excellent 90's movies.  This is a very, very special movie.",1109289600,9,3813,5.250825082508251
2195440,5,B0006TPE4M,"Days consist of a wide variety of coincidences and planned behaviors that make up existence as it is known.  Coincidences affect individual presence in the now, as society seeks a symbiotic connection with existence.  Activities and behaviors that form under habits and conscious decision-making often are a link reached from self toward society where self generates its own coincidences for other entities.  These connections between the individual and society are lost in a myriad of variably meaningful coincidences that most people let slide by, as more significant happenings occur due to choice or are forced upon the individual.  I Heart Huckabees depicts what could happen if existential detectives would investigate one of these coincidences.

Grass root level philosophy in regards to existentialism is brought to the audience's attention through Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) who constantly ponders the incidents happening in his life.  Albert, an environmentalist, frequently writes poetry and seeks to save the marshland where Huckabees plans on building a mall.  At the same time Albert seeks the help of two existential detectives, Vivian (Lily Tomlin) and Bernard (Dustin Hoffman), to find out about one of his coincidences with a tall African-American man that he has bumped into three times.  Bernard gives Albert a lesson in the universe and how everything in the universe is interconnected through a blanket, which in itself is a hilarious scene.  Through the philosophical concept that everything is connected, Vivian and Bernard begin their investigation of Albert's existence, which by the way is done pro-bono.

Albert's investigation of his own existence leads him to meet other people while he attempts to finds out why some people have a meaning to his life.  Some of these people are Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), Brad (Jude Law), and Dawn (Naomi Watts) who all have a strong influence in his life.  Tom is a firefighter that has recently broken up his relationship with his wife, as she did not understand his preoccupation of pondering the troubles of the world.  Through work Albert meets Brad, a climbing and smooth talking businessman for Huckabees, who rubs him the wrong way with his flashy style.  Brad's fiance, Dawn, appears in Albert's dreams and visions, as he tries to figure out why the tall black man has emerged in his life. These people seem to hold the secret to his coincidences, which he slowly begins to loose interest in as the big picture becomes more interesting.  The big picture is a comprehensive view of Albert's own life, which has led him to the situations where the coincidences occurred.

I Heart Huckabees does not converge as most films do, instead it seems fragmented and jolted.  The fragmentation of the story seems to rest with the philosophical notions that are introduced to the audience.  There are actually two different, yet similar, thoughts presented through the characters.  The existential philosophy, at first, appears to be lucid, but it is far from clear or coherent as the story unfolds.  Albert's meeting with Tommy and later Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) drifts off into a cerebral rambling where thoughts are diffused and notions dissected.  These thoughts then again joint into unity that continues to be shattered and rejoins over and over again, which gives the idea that everything is connected and disjointed as the same time.  This leaves the viewers with a satirical take on how a mind might diverge in several different directions interchangeably while eventually settling on one thing that does not make any sense to others.

I Heart Huckabees is similar to a lot of Spike Jonze films such as Being John Malkovich (1999) and Adaptation (2002).  However, this film does not reach the same seriousness on a cerebral level, but it still offers an amusing comedy with heavy doses of irony.  The amazing cast elevates the film with witty jokes, and funny one-liners.  This is all thanks to the director David O. Russell who in the end brings together a funny script through good filmmaking and daringly taking some good chances.  Ultimately, the bravery pays off with a mind-boggling comedy that brings the audience there, here, and everywhere through many bellyaching coincidences.",1109203200,6,4273,5.190962099125365

2195442,4,B0006TPE4M,"I HEART HUCKABEES is odd, weird, unfocused, overly obtuse, and flagrantly over directed and produced.  So why bother seeing it?  Well, given all the above negatives, it all depends on what you expect from spending and hour and a half of your time with an experimental film.  First clue: the cast.  There must be a reason that such class actors as Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Naomi Watts, Dustin Hoffman, and yes, Lily Tomlin would want to be a part of this m&eacute;lange of comedy and philosophy and environmental concerns vs. corporate greed.  Add to the mix the solid work of Mark Wahlberg and Jason Schwartzman and the elusive talent of writer/director David O. Russell (whose biggest credit is 'Spanking the Monkey') and you wind up with a fairly tasty goulash billed as an Existential Comedy.

The fun of the movie is in the attitude of the viewer: if you can swallow the wild antics and bloated concepts and just concentrate on the use/abuse of the theories of Existentialism and Nihilism, you'll have a good time.  This film gives us permission to retrospectively laugh or giggle at memories of college classroom awe with which we absorbed 'the new philosophies'.  Time and the expansion (? or is it contraction?) of the universe have put all things into a different perspective, and for this viewer telling a story about contemporary tropes referencing hallowed philosophical theories works.

Most of the fun comes not from the proposed comedic roles of Hoffman, Tomlin and Huppert (though they are amazingly understated in their acting here), but from the craftsmanship of Law, Watts, and Wahlberg plus a dollop of fresh work from Jason Schwartzman.  Goofy it is, over baked it is, silly and absurd it is, but it is the stuff we walk among everyday! A kinky comedy to be taken with a grain of patience.

I really liked watching this film. Definitely worth even 20 dollars for it..

It was a great comedy movie, and finally a smart film, not some stupid, plain comedy!

As the film rolls along, we see all the drama play out and how characters will lie to try and fool the Existential Detectives, but the joke's on them. Seeing how Jude Law becomes unraveled once his jovial facade is punctured by the detectives, as well as how Schwartzman's existential angst is traced back to an event in childhood is just amazing to watch.

2195446,5,B0006TPE4M,"This film is one of my favorites for 2004.  It was funny and brilliant, and perfectly on the mark regarding psychology.  There are a few flaws in the film, minor ones that if changed could possibly have reached a wider audience, but its still very much worth seeing over and over.

For anyone who's considered taking therapy or is in one now, see this film instead.  The $20 or so you spend on this dvd will be well worth spent after all the money and time spent on therapy.  The reason is because this film gives you all the secrets that you'll only pay big bucks to hear from a ""professional"".  Whatever existential problem one has, the first step to correcting it is to look for the deeper and hidden connection that separates one from another.  What stories to we repeat over and over to other people, and why do we repeat the same stories over and over?  We see examples of this from many angles in this film.

The film begins with obscenity as Jason Schwartzman is heard swearing over and over before we see him.  As the film rolls along, we learn that Schwartzman is an environmentalist with serious problems (bad hair supposedly isn't one of them).  He recognizes a coincidence of seeing the same tall African man on three seperate occasions and this leads him to seek out Existential Detectives, played brilliantly by Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman (both with equally bad hair).  To get to their office, one has to walk a labyrinthian hallway, and this was cleverly done (read Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero With A Thousand Faces"" to find out the purpose of labyrinthes).

The Detectives follow Schwartzman around to get clues into his life, both internal and external.  Hoffman focuses on his inner conflicts, and Tomlin focuses on the minutaie of his life.  What they find out is that there are some serious conflicts that need addressing regarding Schwartzman's animosity towards golden boy Jude Law, who is a rising star at the Huckabees retail chain (think cross between Walmart and Target).  Jude Law perfectly plays a man with everything going for him...good looks, a hot girlfriend (who is the covergirl face of Huckabees), a rising career, famous connections, a house and an SUV.  He is dripping with charisma and Schwartzman hates him for it.

We are also introduced to Mark Wahlberg in an amusing role as a fireman who obsesses over oil after the events of 9/11.  He repeats to anyone and everyone about the impending oil crisis and our oil-dependent lifestyle, but that too is a cry for help, as it has lead to ruinous relationships (confusing his young daughter who doesn't know what to do about the things he points out).  When Wahlberg and Schwartzman are paired up as partners, they fall out of Existential Detectives' influence, taking a liking to the more sadistic rival, played brilliantly by French actress Isabelle Huppert.  She gives them both a lesson in how petty drama distracts people from seeing the truth of their infinite nature and the existential problems that plague all of us.

As the film rolls along, we see all the drama play out and how characters will lie to try and fool the Existential Detectives, but the joke's on them.

Then add some of the sanest, most thought-provoking philosophy (existentialist Sartre in particular) ever, and you the result? David O. Russell's (Flirting with Disaster, Three Kings) new film I Heart Huckabees, a new contribution in a line of what people are calling ""emo"" movies-or at least that is the term I've been hearing. These come to mind: Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Garden State.

We've got a playful cast of characters who take the vague work they've got to go with and make it their own; crystal, yet insane, precision. Jason Schwartzman plays Albert Markovski, a man faced with a coincidence too great to ignore. He stumbles upon the husband-and-wife existential team, Jaffe and Jaffe, to crack the case and solve his existential dilemma. Returning in his first major film since Rushmore, Schwartzman is well cast and impeccable.

Jude Law inhabits the role of Brad Stand, a chairman of Huckabees Corporate, with a comic sensibility. As the Barbie-like Huckabees spokeswoman Dawn Campbell who begins to dress like ""an Amish bag lady"" is Naomi Watts, in a supporting, seldom-seen, but witty performance (I loved the whole ""seven minutes of heaven"" scene). Mark Wahlberg as a fireman, Isabelle Huppert as the existential rival and nihilist, and of course Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin as the detective team give some of their best work here. Not to mention, Wahlberg, along with Watts, is the biggest scene stealer in here.

Like the blanket theory, all of these people are connected.

I can't really explain this movie in an easy way-it's just too difficult to sum up one of the most scatterbrained, intelligent, hilarious, and beautiful films to come out in a long time. You can lop me under the category of ""I Heart this movie,"" because this indie hit is now one of my favorite films of the new century, surprising to say as it is. I Heart Huckabees is the love-it-or-hate-it movie of the year, and I absolutely positively LOVE it!

Huckabees is an often intangible, delightfully peachy, vibrant and unadulterated piece of entertainment that channels the deepest reaches of your thinking all at once. Not to mention the ""journey"" is complemented by the best Jon Brion score EVER! Check out the song ""Over Our Heads."" Brilliant stuff.

As for the movie, you'll laugh, you'll cheer, and you may even cry. I know I did.

Everything, by the end, comes together in a comic and whimsical finale where not everything is resolved, but more questions are raised. Eccentricity and satire have seldom meshed so well in a screenplay that could have sucked. But it doesn't, and I believe that it succeeds on pretty much every level and the pandemonium has never seemed so controlled all at once.

2195449,4,B0006TPE4M,"The simple words, ""Existential Detective"" drove me to the theatre. Who has ever heard of an Existential Detective?

""I Heart Huckabees"" follows four people on their quest to discover the meaning of life. However, with the inconspicuous detective duo, Tomlin and Hoffman, the quartet find they're getting more than what they bargained for. With body bags, snooping trash bins, and listening in on conversations, the detectives try to discover the meaning of their clients' lives. But when their clients get enough of the feel-good-everything-is-connected-happiness, they cross over to the dark side - to nihlism.

The film is a lot more philosophical than I had imagined, and thus, very smartly written. ""I Heart Huckabees"" is strange, but for a point. You may find yourself going back to your college philosophy class, saying things like, ""What is is,"" or ""Nothing comes from nothing.""

I don't think that ""I Heart Huckabees"" is trying to be a lesson in philosophy, though. Indeed, in the end, our protagonist finds a happy medium between la-la land and nihlism, which baffles both sides of the spectrum.

Overall, a very intersting movie. But don't watch it if you're sleepy... Four stars!",1103846400,4,1190,5.150259067357513

This is a beautifully crafted film that pokes fun at everything in American Culture. The film is filled with witty and intellectually hilarious dialogue, strong performances from the whole cast, and is just a ""hey, the world isn't such a dark place"" kind of film. Some people won't understand the films ""infinite nature,"" and/or ability to ""transcend both time and space."" Sadly, this is due in part to major studio's constantly feeding audiences recycled garbage like Bad Boys II, Fast and the Furious, King Arthur, SWAT (and on and on). I Heart Huckabee's is a great film, period.

2195451,2,B0006TPE4M,"I went to see this film last night, and was expecting great things. Good reviews and a fabulous cast. What a mistake! To say it was awful would be harsh, I didn't dislike it, I just didn't care. I didn't care about the characters, except Mark Walburg, who was actually quite amusing, and I didn't care whether I managed to stay awake until the end. There were some funny moments, but overall, it's not worth seeing, nevermind buying the DVD.

However....from the laughs in the cinema, and people I have spoken to today, it does appear that a lot of people have enjoyed it. Maybe I'm just not deep enough to get it, or maybe they just want to apear 'deep' by saying they enjoyed it....",1102550400,3,684,4.428571428571429

2195453,4,B0006TPE4M,"Most of 'I Heart Huckabees' is a philisophical rant concerning the big issues of life (existentialism being the centerpiece). As a result of the often talky and elongated explanations to mysterious answers to life questions, the screenplay may be impenatrable by most. However, if your tastes reflect that of a screw-ball comedy attempting to be a little unusual, a little fun, and a tad more memorable than most in its genre, then sure, I'd highly recommend 'Huckabees' in a  heartbeat. David O. Russel managed to direct a film that stayed with me for a while, as I often pondered the dialogue (while mostly cracking up at the little jokes here and there that would never cease to crack me up for days on end). Not that the dialogue is anything especially profound. In a way, it's deep, and in a way it's just funny and interesting to listen to. You find yourself asking questions and attempting to find answers even when you know that at the end of the day, there just aren't any solutions. It's as if 'Huckabees' is an entire babbling train of thought from the mind of Russel slapped on-screen; something that is involving and intriguing, yet never seems to make sense. Sure, these qualities tended to irritate many an audience member, but honestly, I'm not one of those people. To me, 'I Heart Huckabees' is a delectable doughnut stuffed with a thousand flavors of jelly, one of those things you never want to stop eating. And to top everything off, the actors in 'Huckabees' form the most cohesive and highest quality ensemble of the year thus far, with a nomination-level stand-out performance by Mark Wahlberg. All in all, I just wish it had been...oh I don't know, it was so much fun. Have a go at it, you won't be sorry even if you despise it; at least it had you thinking.",1102377600,4,1782,4.639240506329114
2195454,1,B0006TPE4M,"Every once in awhile, a film is released that causes one to wonder what the studio's movers and shakers were thinking when they decided to invest time and money in the production. Was it a slow day or the oxygen level just too low?

The plot of I HEART HUCKABEES is too incoherent to be easily summarized. Let's just say that environmental activist Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), bothered by some unexplainable coincidences in his life, seeks the help of two Existential Detectives, Bernard Jaffe (Dustin Hoffman) and his wife Vivian (Lily Tomlin). Eventually drawn into the investigation are Brad Strand (Jude Law), an up-and-coming executive with the Huckabees super store chain, Strand's lover Dawn (Naomi Watts), the Huckabees glamorous spokesmodel, the spiritually dissatisfied fireman Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), and the Jaffes' philosophical arch nemesis and former student, the sexy Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert). The Jaffes believe in an interconnected universe in which each person is but part of the whole. Conversely, Vauban believes in a meaningless universe that demands individualism. As my wife, a former film editor, described the plot's printed synopsis, it's a ""mess"".

About the genesis of the screenplay, writer/director David Russell says:

""I have often wondered why it is that in today's many 'smart indie films' the characters often lead to struggle and lead these very dark existences, yet never have recourse to the mysterious traditions of investigating consciousness that have existed throughout human history. In our materialist culture, we have such a strong bias toward 'dark' stories in which everyone is just depressed and struggling and that's life. I think there should be other paradigms and opportunities."" Good grief!

Did I happen to mention that I HEART HUCKABEES is ostensibly a comedy? Actually, it's the perfect example of a film whose concept is so over-intellectualized that it ceases to be entertainment for the critical mass of an audience required to make the film profitable. Evidence for such a conclusion comes from the duration of its residence in theaters, which, in my locale, was the blink of an eye, and the fact that only one person (of perhaps 50) in my screening's audience occasionally tittered. I just happened to see it at a free studio showing, and, in retrospect, I would've paid good money to be denied a seat.

As a viewer, you know you're in trouble when the very fist scene is of Albert shouting obscenities. Then, in a tender moment about midway, Markovski and Vauban have a sexual tryst in the woods, in which the foreplay involves each pushing the other's face into a small pool of muddy water and rubbing themselves with rotting vegetation. (This elicited chuckles from that one co-viewer previously mentioned, and perhaps worried glances from those seated around her.)

This site's reviewing format doesn't allow the award of zero stars, much less anything in the minus range. Too bad. This is one of the worst films of 2004, and perhaps escapes being ""the worst"" only because I haven't seen them all. I can't fathom why such otherwise fine actors as Hoffman, Tomlin, and Watts would be associated with such a project unless they did it as a favor or contracted for the roles before reading the script.",1101772800,6,3283,5.1271028037383175

2195461,4,B0006TPE4M,"I Heart Huckabees definitely had the potential to be a deeper film about existentialism if it wasn't so worried about appealing to the general audience. It was certainly entertaining without a doubt. The acting was spectacular. Jason Schwartzman was amazing as usual. Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin were sort of flat, playing mascot-y characters, but excellent nonetheless.

But I guess if you don't get it, then you don't get it. Some people just aren't into the whole philosophical existential angst type thing.

If you're into movies with really straight foward developed plots, then this is not for you. It's a message resonating through space that had to be condensed and processed under pretty packaging so mainstream consumers would eat it up. Russell is only keeping a bigger picture from us because we don't care enough to find out.

There was no plot, no characters, no reason to care. In fact it ""felt"" like a totally improvised movie by unimaginative actors. Why does a great actor like Dustin Hoffman subject himself to drivel like this?

The questions are good, even if the movie meanders to the point where you don't know what the answers are or are supposed to be. The whole thing feels compromised, yet I'm sure there was a point in there somewhere.

I do know that I didn't laugh. It wasn't funny. It was more like the director, who's usually quite capable, threw all of his characters, questions and plot situations against a wall - like it was pasta - to see if anything would stick, and he just made a movie out of what did.

Is everything connected? Yes and no. Does everything matter? Yes and no.

In the world of a screenplay governed by the writer-as-God, isn't it easier and more convenient to show connections than it would be in, say, a documentary about coincidence? In a screenplay, aren't random chances suddenly not random because the characters are only doing what you're telling them to do, anyway?

I don't get this movie. Why does Brad cry when faced with his repeated story about Shania Twain and tuna fish? Why does Albert have sex with the French philosopher in the mud puddle, other than to prove that we're eventually ""pulled back into human drama?""

2195466,3,B0006TPE4M,"The mind-bending, heart-tugging cinematic brilliance of Charlie Kaufman is at once a great blessing and great curse upon modern cinema. On the upside, he and other narrative trailblazers have inspired a new desire from audiences to be stimulated beyond the normal amount, I believe. Then again, there's a downside to this: ripoffs, take-offs, and cash-ins. Case in point: I Heart Huckabees, David O. Russell's post-Adaptation era attempt to raise big questions in a really weird way that starts well, aims high, but ultimately falls short.

  There's a lot to admire in this relentlessly strange and dense 'existential comedy:' performers acting their hearts out (Naomi Watts and Mark Wahlberg), a musician singing his heart out (the always-brilliant Jon Brion), and a plot that not only makes logical sense but philosophical sense. What Huckabees is sadly missing, though, is the heart itself that writers like Kaufman wear on their sleeves. And it shows.

  A plot synopsis would be a little dumb, but I'll try nobly: Albert (Jason Schwartzmann) encounters a series of coincidences that he considers far from random. This not only leads him to totally question his life, but to enlist two existential detectives (Lily Tomlin, Dustin Hoffman) to solve his crisis. One rule Albert gives to Vivian and Stanley Jaffe: don't meddle in his work situation. You see, he's at odds with the company pretty boy (Jude Law) who has gone behind Albert's back and thwarted an ecological initiative to give the Huckabees corporation (obviously a take-off on Wal-Mart) good PR.

  Through related characters we meet the Huckabees spokeswoman (Naomi Watts, looking the most beautiful she ever has here), an ecologically concerned fireman suffering his own existential crisis (Mark Wahlberg), a sadistic French philosopher who is at odds with the Jaffes (Isabelle Huppert), and a running gag about Shania Twain. If it sounds exhausting, that's because it is. Russell interweaves his plot strands into a melange of wackiness while exploring Albert's existential issues through some hilarious moments, and actually has a sort of convential three-act plot that keeps moving as well. In theory, the movie works, and that's why I'm (barely) recommending it. In all reality, though, Huckabees is too inconsistent for its own good.

  First of all, for all the laugh-out-loud non-sequiters (which are not as abundant as poo-pooing critics Ebert and Roeper claim), there are stretches of uncomfortable unfunniness that reminded me of a similar experience last week watching Team America. Huckabees has these wild situations that burst into occasional moments of comic brilliance, but there is an uncomfortable lull in between almost each one.

  Second of all, Russell commits the worst sin of any movie exploring enormous questions like this and actually answers them. And a little to simply, if you ask me. The beauty of life, of existential philosophy, is that it's an endless realm of questions that are better left unanswered. When Russell moves the film into its third act with the intent to answer these, he has the subtlety of the psychologist at the end of Psycho who goes over every dirty detail of Norman Bates' life. Out come condemnations of materialism, exaltations of philosophical harmony (""everything is connected"" - *closing eyes and crossing legs indian-style* ""hmmmmm....."")...in short, things that have been done before. Russell takes a movie that could have been something to make you think, and just does the thinking for you.

  When it comes down to the movie as a whole, though, it's just a deeply flawed decent movie. As much as I felt the resolution of everything was ham-handed and unnecessary, it at least makes sense and is true. And I have to admire Russell in some way for at least making a movie that outwardly explores philosophical issues usually left for professors hunched over desk lamps at universities. Huckabees is a mixed bag of goodness and mediocrity, humor and awkwardness, but it comes out standing in the end even if it fails to make the emotional connection that movies like Etenal Sunshine... do. The fact that it works is thanks to, for the most part, Mark Wahlberg, who takes this movie and runs away with it like Renee Zellweger in last year's Cold Mountain. Huckabees is far from a great movie, but it's so far-reachingly odd and so ambitious I give it credit. You'll leave the theater scratching your head with this one, but it won't be because it's confusing; it'll be because you wished it was better. B-",1098748800,10,4536,5.106756756756757

Sometimes I think so hard about a movie that my head hurts. Maybe when you watch a movie you like your head hurts from all the pretty explosions and non-stop action.

With that said, I loved this. It reminded me that the world can be looked at in many different ways and warned me to not look at life too optimistically or pessimistically. In a way it reminded me of Fight Club in that the main characters had to break down their preconceived notions of their motives in order to figure out what they really wanted from life.",1098662400,8,665,4.277777777777778

During his truth quest, Albert meets other neurotics and misfits, including an angry fireman played with great hilarity by Mark Wahlberg of Boogie Nights fame. The film is an intelligent, complex romp of the earnest quest for truth, therapy, metaphysics, self-aggrandizing posers of all stripes.

It is a bit wordy and the dialogue will more than likely go over the head of the average audience, but still this film should not be missed. Jason Schwartzman finally gives a performance in which I actually like him. Jude Law, as the antagonist corporate shill for Huckabees, passes a flawless ""American"" accent. The real stand-outs in this film, however, are Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman as the Jaffes. Both have a sense of great timing and really add a bit of ridiculousness to the philosophies they are espousing. Kudos also to Talia Shire, in a hilariously foul-mouthed turn as Schwartzman's mom and Naomi Watts for those wacky Huckabees commercials.",1098662400,3,707,4.9
2195470,4,B0006TPE4M,"I wasn't looking forward to this in the least, but I got dragooned into seeing it and I''m here to tell you, sometimes being a good sport pays off!  In fact i was determined not to like the movie, since I can't stand Dustin Hoffman or Lily Tomlin or Mark Wahlberg or Isabelle Huppert and all of them have pretty good size parts in this film.  PLUS it was directed by David O. Russell whose previous films I had liked -- a little.

And i don't know about you, but the reviews that I happened to read were pretty abysmal.  However, the movie is actually very good.  Some compare it to ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine"" but  I liked it a lot better than either.  As my wife says, it has more heart than those other, rather chilly pictures.  The characters played by Hoffman and Tomlin really do seem to adore ecah other, different as they are, and Tomlin really gave heterosexuality a go in a convincing way as she hasn't since the sublime NASHVILLE, and I brought it!  She looked great in her slightly period costumes, always neat, elegant and kind of noir as befit her appearance as an ""existential detective.""  What was also a wonderful surprise was seeing Tippi Hedren once again in a part with a little bit of substance for a change.  She still looks wonderful, better than Melanie in fact, and she can act up a storm.  Wait till you see Isabelle Huppert and Jason Schwartzmann rolling around in a swamp, it will bring back your memories of Turner Classic movies DUEL IN THE SUN with Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones crawling towards each other in a hotbed of blood and sand.

Jude Law and Naomi Watts are pretty appealing, as two shallow yuppies whose lives come to a shattering changeover as they realize the hollowness in the core of their lives.  They don't have perfect American accents, but that's okay.  Mark Wahlberg looks a lot like his brother Donnie in this one--are they sure Donnie didn't come in, punch the clock using his brother's time card, cause that's what it looks like.  The only one who I thought should have given this project a miss is Talia Shire, the sister of Francis Ford Coppola.  Here she looks as if she's had 500 face lifts and it has prevented mobility in her looping, you can barely understand the former ADRIAN from the Rocky films.

Even despite the film's obvious disdain for its audience, it still strikes me as a necessary experience, an opportunity for people to escape the narcissism that bogs them down by understanding just how ordinary they are, how universal their personal torments happen to be. I think it is a fantastic and vital message, but this kind of spitting into common human vanity is difficult to endure, and even though Dustin Hoffman, Mark Wahlberg and Jude Law turn in phenomenally convincing performances, the self effacement the movie forces on its audience is painful. It is the kind of thing you simply tolerate, because it makes you laugh just as often as it makes you cringe. Russell understands that what human beings desire more than anything else is to believe that we are all special individuals, that we are as incapable of being wholly understood by others as we are worthy of their love. But rather than warming us up to this reality (I don't mean to suggest that this is what Russell should have done), the director's jadedness and embitterment leads him down a particularly venomous indictment of the human race. It isn't that I disagree with him -- I actually happen to believe that Russell is really on to something -- it is just that Russell seems incapable of achieving a fundamental emotional distance from his material that is necessary to pull off a convincing and memorable film. Ironically, Russel is as endeared to his own nihilistic agenda as his characters are to their egos, and in the end, he just exposes himself as a victim of the very insecurities from which his characters suffer. I still contend that this is a necessary film, but be warned: it is by no means an easy task.",1098489600,3,1808,4.761146496815287

A noble failure. A comedy with very few laughs. A movie that doesn't know whether its mocking its philosophies or trying to search for them. Jonathan Mostow brings in a disappointing performance, and Hoffman and his wife character are painfully annoying and also unfunny. There are some good moments, but over all the first half of the movie is very forced. The script is way too noticeable, it almost felt like an exercise for actors rather than an actual movie with real dialogue. If you want to feel cultured or smart for enjoying this movie, go right ahead. I just wish my life was so easy that I could run around trying to answer existential questions like the awful characters in this movie. The movie just tries way too hard and never fully becomes what it wants. Wahlberg and Naomi Watts are highlights and make this movie much more watchable, but alas they still couldn't save the script from itself.

Garden State is a lot more subtle and communicates its ideas visually instead of discussing it out loud using characters who may as well be reading from a texit book.",1098403200,4,1084,4.670157068062827
2195473,5,B0006TPE4M,"Here'a a guy, David Russell (director), who is not afraid of much at all cinematically.  What does he do?  He takes the zany, rapid-fire pacing of the great screwball comedies (His Girl Friday, Adam's Rib, Ball of Fire, The Lady Eve are four of my faves) and updates the form with metaphysical musings on man's place in the universe.  Add to that a great cast and surreal character pairings (a married couple of existential detectives?  a firefighter and an environmentalist?  a Sudanese refugee doorman and an arch-conservative patriarch?), and you have a mix that spells outrageous comedy for the 21st century.

Some of the scenes are so brilliant that my friend Sue and I nearly fell out of our seats laughing.  One example: an ancient Spanish woman, complete with simple black hooded garment, a multitude of wrinkles, and clear-frame glasses, intones ageless mystical mumbo-jumbo while a bespectacled translator, an ever-worried expression on his face, translates her gobbledegook for the benefit of those who need spiritual counseling.  Scenes like this abound, and Russell as well does some nifty stuff with screen technique--not screen splitting, but screen parceling into tiny fragments to illustrate the ""profound"" truths the existential detectives impart to their initially eager pupils.

As the detectives, Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman are perfect, and Mark Wahlberg as the hyper, musclebound, overly enthusiastic firefighter has one of his best roles ever.  Jason Schwartzman, from the great Wes Owen film Rushmore, is here as the environmentalist and lends the correct fusion of angst and intensity that fuels this baby the way it should be.  Jude Law and Naomi Watts make a great neo-yuppie couple totally sold out to the Huckabees corporation.  Isabelle Huppert shows up as a nihilistic counterpart to the gonzo detective couple--all three are in their early 60s and give their hearts and souls to what they're doing.  And in supporting roles, Richard Jenkins, Jean Smart, Tippi Hedren (yep, from Marnie, that's right), and Kevin Dunn all turn in spot on performances.

This is not a film driven by plot, but by character and, mostly, dialogue.  See it for the inspired wackiness of the absolutely nutso thought patterns on display.  As our hero, the environementalist, begins to unravel metaphysically, the dialogue and action, such as it is, become increasingly zingy.

What is Russell saying here?  A lot.  At the same time a skewering of American shallowness and European substance, the film as well makes fun of films that throw darts at these major subjects.  It's nice to see a director who knows how to make fun of his own willingness to satirize and do it in such an entertaining way.  This is a comedy for people who can think and laugh--specifically, laugh at how intellectuals are perceived as being intellectuals, or how culture is perceived as being what it is, at how we worship, to whatever extent, what we half understand and half don't.  This half-understanding stance is beautifully portrayed by firefighter Mark Wahlberg who spouts what could be called intellectual cliches at the drop of a hat.

Truly unique and groundbreaking, I Heart Huckabees is a film that takes the Coen Brothers' penchant for neo-screwballers and not so much updates it as transforms it into a showpiece for stuff that has not been seen before.  Brilliant!",1098403200,7,3368,5.115173674588665

To describe the plot would be pointless, because the plot isn't really as important as the dialogue and the spirited performances. Essentially what happens is Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), an environmentalist is having problems dealing with the meaning of his life and his relationships, so he seeks advice from a husband and wife team of ""existential detectives"" Vivian and Bernard Jaffe (Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman). While examing his relationships with his parents, a corporate rival (Jude Law), Albert teams up with a burned-out firefighter, Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlburg) who suffers from trauma from 9/11. Tommy and Albert both dissastisfied at the Jaffes' progess go to French Nihilist, Catrine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) for help.

The plot sounds bizarre, and writing it, I felt a little strange, as if I had misunderstood the film. But it is worth seeing because of David Russell's committment, to not only the plots ""gimmick,"" but also his need to remain true to the characters.

The performances are great. Schwartzman, excellent in _Rushmore_ is superb as Albert, the disillusioned environmentalist. He conveys both Albert's cynicism, as well as, deep desire to understand his life. He has expressive eyes that at once can register stoicism, joy and pain. Wahlburg offers easily his best performance here, outdoing his honerable work in _Boogie Nights_. Jude Law as the corporate shark is approrpiately slimey, though his scenes are often stolen by the luminous Naomi Watts as his spokesmodel girlfriend. Hoffman (looking hilarious in a Beatles mop-top haircut) and Tomlin (very chic in heels and tailored suits) both do predictably excellent work; Tomlin, especially, who does some nifty physical comedy as well. Huppert nails her scenes with her deadpan delivery, though her understanding of her character never makes her performance one-note. There are some great cameos, as well: Tippi Hedren (who looks stunning) gives a funny performance as a member of Jude Law's fan club; Talia Shire is great as Albert's distant mother, in a heart-wrenching scene; Jean Smart is hilarious as a typical middle-America hausfrau; and Shania Twain herself shows up for a few scenes, proving that even pop divas have a sense of humor.

Not extremely accessible, though overtly intellectual, this film is a good balance of both, attempting to reach to a broad audience, yet make them think at the same time.",1098316800,4,2571,5.263414634146342

Albert betrays himself and seeks the assistance of an existential detective (family therapist) to help him figure out why and how to begin to heal it.

D: You were embarrassed for feeling sad about the death of your cat.  It's painful enough to feel sad, but on top of it, to feel embarrassed for feeling.  That's the killer.

Mother:  How is that my fault?  I didn't tell him to be embarrassed.

D:  But you did.  It was more important to have a cup of coffee with a perfect stranger than to talk to Albert about what for a small boy is a large tragedy.

Mother:  That's ridiculous.

D:  He climbed out his window, a criminal in his own home.  Why?

(Mother and D begin to argue) Father: I think you should go.

D:  No, I will not go.  Albert has a place.  A place you denied.

M:  This is my home.  I can tell him what I want.

D:  Yes.  Your home is a lie.

M: What does that mean?  I gave my life to this selfish bas___

D: So he could be an ornament to you, not a person.

(Doorman enters):  You asked me to come up here?

M:  What does the doorman have to do with this?

D to Albert: He was orphaned by civil war.  You were orphaned by indifference.  This is but one part of your puzzle.  Do you see?

Albert's friend: You were trained to betray yourself right here.  That's why you betrayed yourself ...

D2 on a lie Albert told before: You encrypted the truth.  That's how good you are at betraying yourself.

A second character in film seeks the help of an existential detective.

""What's so great about depression?""  ""Nothing, unless it holds the key to something you compulsively avoid so it will never be examined or felt.  Hence your behaviour becomes repetitive, like the story [you keep telling].""

Humourously interwoven throughout the film are jokes and warnings about the spiritual bypassing magical thinking new age movement on one end of the spectrum, and its polar opposite, the ""cruelty, manipulation, meaninglessness"" of nihilism, on the other, as ""two overlapping fractured philosophies[/defense mechanisms].""

Psychology offers the middle road and bridge between the splits we make in response to trauma, personally and socially, and the three detectives handle both.
