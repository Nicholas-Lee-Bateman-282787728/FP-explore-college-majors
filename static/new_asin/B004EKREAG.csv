8427139,5,B004EKREAG,"The movie, however, had its other rewards to offer. A simple, no-nonsense plot about the woes of the family of a wrongly executed man, this film for the most part matches the reaction to the action with minimal overacting. The culminating scene wherein Anil Kapoor, apart from rescuing his mother, gives vent to his pent up feelings of righteous anguish and indignation against the vile acts of Amreesh Puri due to which he had to lead all his life in bitterness -- physical and mental -- is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. In this emotional tirade, we the viewers, have emotions exactly like a person would have, who has been victimised thus. This sympathy of emotions is the biggest achievement of this film.",1301270400,,720,4.722222222222222
