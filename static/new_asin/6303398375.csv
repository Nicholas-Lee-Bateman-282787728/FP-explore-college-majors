640187,5,6303398375,"A boy (Bart Bradley) on the beach finds a canister form a wayward spaceship that crashed in the sea. Hence the title 20 Million Miles to Earth"" It yields a cute little creature that just loves to eat sulfur. He just wants to be friends and is intrigued with his environment. As with all innocent space creatures just as he is beginning to trust us, he is enslaved abused and thoroughly disenchanted. This is just an enjoyable creature movie with some people interaction and a question of what you do with a misplaced Ymir.

As you have guessed this movie is packed with Ray Harryhausen's stop motion. See more of Ray's work in ""Clash of the Titans"" notice how that there titan from the sea looks like the Ymir.

640253,3,6303398375,"20 Million Miles to Earth, 1957 film

It begins at a fishing village in Sicily. Fishermen pull in a net. They see something in the sky, it crashes into the sea. They row towards it, there is a hole in the side of the rocket. Two men go inside and find an unconscious man and carry him out to their boat. One man stays inside then leaves. The rocket sinks with its contents. In Washington a general in the Pentagon discusses the rocket, and will leave for Sicily. The rescued men are taken to Doctor Leonardo. A young boy finds a metal canister with something inside and brings it to Leonardo for a sale. One man is well, the second is ill. How long can that specimen in the can survive?

The sick man dies after warning about that specimen. Dr. Leonardo finds a small creature in his house! Where did it come from? A twin-engine flying boat lands in the sea; the General arrived. They want to find that specimen taken from the planet Venus (which has valuable minerals). How can a creature survive on that inhospitable planet? They offer a half-million as a reward. That young boy tells where that metal cylinder is. The Colonel gets a description of the man who bought it. That small creature has escaped and is growing quickly! Can they find it in the woods? That man-like lizard scares sheep as it wanders.

A dog attacks it, the creature kills it. A man with a gun looks for his dog Carlo. The Colonel says the creature must be taken alive. Can they trap it? It attacks a man! They shoot it but cant kill it. Can they use an electrified wire to stun and capture it? Police use dogs to track the creature in the woods. Helicopters take part in the search. The police shoot at it. A flame thrower drives it away. The helicopters see the creature by the sulfur beds. They drop bags of sulfur to attract the creature to its food. Troops leave the helicopter to search for the creature. A helicopter drops a net to trap the creature, electricity is turned on to stun it! The General speaks to reporters about the airship XY-21. It landed on Venus and returned with Colonel Calder.

The creature is held in the zoo. Three reporters are taken to see it. Electricity keeps it unconscious. Its olfactory system is superior to anything on earth says one scientist. Firearms do not damage it because it has no heart or lungs. Then something goes wrong! The power is gone, the creature awakens and breaks free. It wrestles with an elephant and wins. Colonel Bob calls for firepower. People scream and run in panic! The creature destroys the road on a bridge. Then old buildings when it is attacked. It climbs atop a high building where troops fire upon it. Then it falls! Why is it so costly to mover from the present to the future?

If you ever travel to Rome and see the damaged buildings youll know how it happened. You just saw it in this movie! The trick photography was done decades before Computer Generated Images. Does the story seem like a copy of the old King Kong movie? Its like a warning against taking creatures from their native environment and bringing them to civilization. Is this movie a warning against immigration? [Or the dangers from unregulated financial exploitation?] Those outdoor scenes remind me of the Westerns produced in the 1940's.",1499904000,,3257,4.532312925170068

These are iconic ""fifties monster movies"", but the transfer just doesn't look right. Muddy and with a pixelated feel in parts. Not crisp black and white like decent blu-ray transfers I've seen done for movies of a similar vintage.

I guess the price point is the only reason I am not bothering to send it back. But if I had seen the picture quality before I bought it, I wouldn't have paid the $7.50.

640390,5,6303398375,"This product is a DVD that has two movies, each featuring special effects by the legendary Ray Harryhausen. While reasonable minds may differ, I believe that SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is the most famous of Mr. Harryhausen's movies. Of the pair of movies in this DVD product, I consider IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA to have better character development and to have special effects that are more dramatic. I mean, what can be more dramatic than a huge octopus that raises havoc in downtown San Francisco and tears down nearby Golden Gate Bridge. In the interest of economy of words, and because of my personal prejudice, I am only posting here my review of IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, which I have watched on about ten or twenty occasions in all. In addition to the fine character development and special effects, I am prejudiced in favor of this movie because it concerns research scientists (I am a biochemist) and because some of the movie takes place in San Francisco (I live near San Francisco). 20 Million Miles To Earth concerns a flying lizard that reches earth by way of a rocket ship piloted by earthlings that crash lands in the ocean off the coast of Italy. The lizard is small, at first, and then it grows to be larger than an adult elephant. Most of the movie is occupied by the sort of fighting, shooting of military weapons, and destruction of buildings that is typically found in Godzilla movies. Okaaaaay, that's all I care to say about 20 Million Miles To Earth. One viewing is enough.

I first saw IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA in 1957. At that time, I was in second grade. A group of kids on school trip were being taken to see OLD YELLER. However, when we got to the theater it was sold out. And so, as fate would have it, the mother in charge of the trip took us to see IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA. It was Bobby Moore's mother. The Moore family ran a clothing store in New Haven, Connecticut. A few decades later, I managed to find a DVD with OLD YELLER, and found it boring and depressing, and was very, very pleased with the fact that it had been sold out and that, as a consequence we saw IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA (exciting and thrilling) instead.

The film starts with a tense episode in a submarine, and introduces kids to all sorts of interesting gizmos, such as sonar, Geiger counters, and periscopes. The film gets off to a humorous start, as there is a slight disagreement among submarine personnel as to whether the music played on board should be Hawaiian music or big band.

ROMANCE AND INNUENDOS. Then, the film dwells extensively on light banter in a marine biology laboratory. The goal of the Navy submarine captain is to recruit the marine biologists to help the Navy predict where the octopus will strike next. But the captain is able to multi-task. His second task is to get cozy with the female marine biologist. The captain is not really subtle about this goal, which is understandable, in view of the fact that his career path requires him to spend years and years in a cramped submarine (in this context, there are few opportunities to learn tactics in courtship behavior). At 20 minutes into this movie, there is a shocking innuendo. Actress Faith Domergue is holding a standard piece of lab equipment. It is a graduated cylinder. Basically, it is a glass cylinder about ten inches long and two inches wide. She is holding it, and toying with it, so that it is positioned directly in front of actor Kenneth Tobey's belt. There is no question in my mind what the director and cinematographer were thinking when they filmed this scene. I am shocked that the censors did not catch it. The film director is to be commended for infusing the romantic episodes with ambiguity. The calculated ambiguity is this: is the woman involved with the male marine biologist or or with the captain (Kenneth Tobey)? Hints of a love triangle continue, from time to time, throughout the entire movie. In fact, the conclusion of the movie seems to be that the captain lost out. There is not enough romance to dampen a kid's enthusiasm for the plot. And there is hardly any kissing. Therefore, your kids won't be covering their eyes while exclaiming, ""EWWWWWWWWW!""

In a scene in the marine biology lab, there is a prominent sign reading NO SMOKING. But the submarine captain, in speaking with the marine biologists, proves to be a chain smoker. Kids will love observing this discrepancy on their own, as the contradiction is not discussed by any of the actors.

""Woman's liberation"" plays a surprisingly prominent role in this film, the female marine biologist is a university professor, a Ph. D. Other films from this era would not have done this and would have instead given the woman a master's degree, at most.

SCENE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA. Then we are introduced to the giant octopus. The giant octopus ensnares a ship and takes it down. What follows is an excellent course in psychology, where a surviving sailor is so shocked that he cannot describe the octopus, but merely points to the rubber tubing of the examining physician's stethoscope. The doctor makes some subtle pronouncements, indicating that he believes the sailor to be nuts. The other sailors, waiting their examination, agree among each other to pretend that they saw nothing (to avoid being diagnosed as nuts). I first saw this movie in 1957, and when I finally got around to buying the DVD version of the movie in 2009, the only thing that I remembered was the scene in the doctor's office where the traumatized sailor stated that the monster looked like the rubber tubes of the stethoscope.

As if the film was not dramatic enough, the octopus attacks San Francisco, tears down the Golden Gate Bridge, and extends its tentacles along the Embarcadero, near an area of San Francisco now named after journalist Herb Caen.

COMMENT ABOUT RADIATION. The special effects are more than adequate and the dialogue refrains from bogging down in scientific nonsense. I have only one tiny complaint about the ""science."" The film discloses that the giant octopus is RADIOACTIVE. However, the script-writer may have been a little confused. The way radiation works, is that it induces a mutation in the chromosome, where the result is over-active growth hormone, where the result is a giant monster. If the mutation is in a germ cell, the mutation will be inherited, and the children will be giant monsters. Thus, it is the case that radiation initially causes a mutation that generates the monstrous octopus, but it is NOT the case that the giant octopus itself can possibly be radioactive. However, most people won't be bothered by this apparent inaccuracy, about the octopus itself being RADIOACTIVE. (The radioactivity is from an atomic bomb, and it makes no sense to suggest that the octopus itself would acquire the same property). I do want to recommend another excellent movie that concerns radiation-induced giant ants. This is the movie, THEM. The science talk is reasonably accurate and is kept to a minimum, in THEM.

In the colorized version, the colorization is excellent. The color looks about like that in an old color movie, such as Gone With The Wind. The flesh tones, interior of the submarine, sky, Golden Gate Bridge, are all convincingly colored. The colorizing company is identified at the end of the film. I am glad that they did not take liberties, and try to color things to look gaudy or more splendid.",1463097600,,7421,4.7331786542923435

Ray Harryhausen's special effects make this movie what it is, a classic of the '50's Sci-Fi genre. If you haven't seen it yet, you really should. If you've seen it already, you may be like me and want to watch it again (and again!).

640415,5,6303398375,"Definitely worth it. A wonderfully nostalgic film from another era which some might find a bit limited if they're used to CGI filled monster movies but if you can put your self in to the mind of a 1950s audience and remember that one guy did all the special visual effects (Ray Harryhausen designed the set pieces, originated the story, story boarded it, built the models and photographed and animated them), then this is a masterpiece.
The extras (over and hour of making of interviews) plus a commentary and the option to watch the film in a newly colourised process (approved by Harryhausen himself) or its original black and white make this a bargain no 1950s science fiction fan can afford to miss.
Also it's region AB&C so it plays on US and UK bluray players!

I have to assume that anyone who is buying this set already owns the DVD versions of them, so I won't go into the movie summaries.  What I will say is that the Bluray quality of both movies is excellent.  When it comes to Bluray versions of the classic sci-fi / horror movies, I worry about being able to see ""too much"" in that the superb quality of the picture will reveal the special effects.  In some movies, that is indeed the case.  However, here being both Ray Harryhausen movies, the special effects are not revealed and the quality of the monsters is actually enhanced from the DVD versions.  The video is extremely clean (free of grain) and the audio is enhanced as well.  If you were on the fence about these particular movies, rest assured that the quality is outstanding and well beyond worth the price of what Amazon is charging for this set.

I love both of those movies for sure, but those movies were epic adventures that were driven by his special effects.  This movie is an example of a simple and wonderful little sci-fi film that becomes a master piece with the addition of his work.  Not unlike King Kong or other monster movies of the past, it presents a creature that is misunderstood by humans and therefore must be destroyed.

640569,4,6303398375,"I probably don't have to sell you on these movies, but you never know. Many years ago, a friend of mine asked me if i wanted to come along to see 3 Godzilla movies at a downtown theater. I smiled and said I thought I'd pass. ""You don't understand,"" he told me. ""These old flicks look funny on TV, but on the big screen, they're a whole 'nother deal!"" That made sense to me, so I went, and of course he was right, we had a great time, screaming and cheering with the rest of the audience. You just haven't seen a monster movie if  you've only seen it on TV in the old days.

Now, these two films aren't Toho, they're two of Ray Harryhausen's greatest monster flicks. And they look stupendous and exciting.

There's been some criticism of the picture quality of this edition, but as far as I can see on my 46"" Polaroid, they are identical to the Sony release. Detail is crisp, though there is something of a bit-depth issue in the 20 Million Miles to Earth transfer, but the Sony release looks the same. Both transfers are overall excellent, and if the picture is low on contrast, that's a feature of the source material, with all its optical process shots.

Perhaps one of Ray Harryhausen's brilliant science fiction masterpieces, ""20 Million Miles To Earth"" is also perhaps indirectly responsible for conspiracy theorists who believe that there were secret missions to the moon by NASA after the launch of Apollo 17.
Venus, not the moon, was the goal of a secret space mission launched by the United States to learn the mysteries of the second planet from the Sun.  Unfortunately most of the crew perished in the extreme environment of Venus and the three remaining survivors managed to return back home to Earth, only to end up crashing their single stage rocket ship into the Mediterran Ocean off the cost of Sicily near a small fishing village.
Only the captain of the expedition survives - after he and a dying crewmember are rescued by nearby fishermen who put their fears aside to aid those in need.
Venus, we learn, has minerals important for the development of Human technology and the biology of the native life form brought back by the ill-fated Venus expedition must be recovered and studied before humans can go back to the second planet.
Enter one greedy boy who wants to earn enough money to buy his own dude ranch in Texas and a lovely not-quiet, but almost a doctor lady who is traveling in a trailer with her zoologist grandfather, and you've got an intriguing yarn from the Golden Age of Science Fiction.
""20 Million Miles To Earth"" is basically a misunderstood monster story that has a tragic ending - well at least for the monster.

640823,4,6303398375,"For almost half a century I had wanted to see this movie. I had seen pictures of various scenes inside books and magazines, which were enticing, but the film itself was never shown in theaters again, or in television. As I grew older I particularly wanted to see it because of  Harryhausen (by my 30s I knew who he was and what he had done). I finally got to see it today after coming across this DVD in a bookstore.

Anyway, the plot of the movie is very simple: an expedition to the planet Venus (before scientists knew, like they do now, that Venus is a hellhole) returns and crashes into the Mediterranean. One (arrogant, obnoxious) colonel survives. A cocoon also washes ashore. It contains a humanoid alien, which has a very fast growth rate. It does not eat plants or animals, just sulphur, and it does not harm others until systematically provoked. So, naturally, the human beings want to kill it. The film does not condemn this outlook, but presents it as a totally reasonable reaction. Better than, say, putting the animal in an isolated island and studying it. As for the love interest, the girl in the movie must be a masochist to be enamored with the (jackass) colonel. The film should be viewed strictly as a study of Harryhausen.",1417910400,,1244,4.599099099099099

There is some print damage and noticeable grain in some of the special effect scenes especially in it came from beneath the sea.

640829,3,6303398375,"As 50's monster flicks go, ""20 Million Miles To Earth"" is tons of fun with a memorable, sympathetic monster in an unusual setting (how many giant monster movies happen in Italy?).  ""It Came Beneath The Sea"" is a tad slow during the non monster parts, but when the six-tentacled Giant Octopus (Hexopus? Sexopus?) is on-screen you'll have plenty of fun.  Both films obviously feature truly excellent stop-motion effects by Ray Harryhausen.

These movies are a good time, and should be seen by any 50's monster movie/B-movie/MST3k nut out there (that's why I have them!).  However, be warned that the picture quality is lacking.  The Blu-Ray detail is there, but the print quality is odd.  Instead of being a rich contrast, these films are a lot grayer than any other B/W films I have on Blu-Ray, with noticeable spots of blocky gray pixels especially on the background buildings when the monsters are out doing their thing.  I dunno what the source material was on this, but I bought this as an upgraded replacement to my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sci-Fi-Creature-Classics-4-Movie-Set/dp/B00HFWETZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sci-Fi Creature Classics - 4-Movie Set</a>, which features both these films (along with the excellent B-movie greatness of ""The Giant Claw"" and ""Mothra"").  Regretably, compressed though they were on the DVD, the contrast of the B/W picture was much better on the Harryhausen flicks than it is on this Blu-Ray.  Maybe you won't mind the pixel thingy as much as I did, but it was distracting enough for me to sell my set.

In short, if you just want to see these movies, go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sci-Fi-Creature-Classics-4-Movie-Set/dp/B00HFWETZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sci-Fi Creature Classics - 4-Movie Set</a>&nbsp;or if you already love them and want them in Hi-Def, get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ray-Harryhausen-Collection/dp/B001D7T69K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ray Harryhausen Collection</a>&nbsp;Blu Ray set instead (I did!), the picture quality is easily superior to this, plus you get two more movies and colorized versions to boot.",1415059200,13,2233,6.15112540192926

640878,5,6303398375,"""20 Million Miles to Earth"" is another Ray Harryhausen classic. As this is an earlier (1957) sci-fi film, some of the special effects methods are far from perfect, but the Venusian creature is fantastic and scary. The acting isn't bad, led by William Hopper and the very attractive Joan Taylor. And let us not forget the memorable performance of the boy (Pepe- played by Bart Bradley) who started all of the problems with the monster. There is a cameo by Mr. Harryhausen, also, who is the man feeding the elephant at the zoo. As much as I always prefer the original black and white movies, I must say that the colorization of this film is excellent, and in this blu-ray you can watch it both ways.",1409529600,,697,4.5396825396825395

The acting is pretty bad and like most movies of the era, it has an abrupt ending so don't be thinking it was an award winner for acting or screenplay. It's especially funny when the guy says ""the creature?...loose and on the rampage....if it isn't stopped it will kill hundreds, maybe thousands"" (said like he's reading a loud 50's news bulletin). If you love old sci-fi movies for RH's special effects, campy scripts and acting, you can't miss this one. It's the classic that set the standard for special effects thereafter

the monster is captured but eventually gets loose and has a fight with an elephant at the zoo he is being kept at.

Watching the character from the time he hatches from an gelatinous egg, you grow surprisingly attached to him, even though he's technically the monster.  It's the same approach used in King Kong, and for the same reason.

Fun to watch, with great animation and very high quality Dynamation compositing.  The quality of the HD transfer is very good.

""20 Million Miles From Earth,"" may sound like a outer space sci-fi, but in reality, it's an alien that landed on earth as a baby, & grows, & grows! You even start to feel affection & sympathy for the poor little fellow, as he grows up with the care of humans! Only problem is, that he doubles in size every day! Talk about your bouncing baby monsters!

Special effects master, Ray Harryhausen handles the stop motion superbly, & notice the monster, if that is not a proto-type for his Kracken in his last film, ""Clash of the Titans,"" I'll turn into a big fat wart toad! Well, at least a horny toad!

Some great scenes here, especially a fight with an elephant. Good acting, & director Nathan Juran (The Deadly Mantis) does another fine job, & you got to love those 50's sci-fi soundtracks!

And this is part of its charm, because the real locations and the local

I think that the Venusian creature and the Elephant are more realistic
than the mythical creatures Ray Harryhausen created for Sinbad.

Soon, the creature reaches an enormous size, and sets off on a rampage through the streets of Rome with the military hot on its trail. Special effects master Ray Harryhausen unleashes one of his most memorable creations in 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH, bringing the Ymir to life in an incredibly articulated animated performance. The plot follows the same path of destruction that had become characteristic of so many other 1950's Science Fiction pictures, but unlike the radioactive ants in THEM or Harryhausen's earlier reptilian monstrosity THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, the audience is led to empathize with the Ymir, who is simply lost in a foreign world that it does not understand. The humans handle the creature the only way they know how: through brute force and utter annihilation. Director Nathan Juran steps back and gives Harryhausen the center stage to work his magic, but backs the animation with solid characters and a winning cast (including THE BAD SEED's William Hopper). Harryhausen's most stunning achievement in the film involves a showdown between the Ymir and a bull elephant that pours out of the zoo and into the bustling city streets. 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH is another ambitious creature feature that demonstrates some of the finest work by one of Science Fiction's most brilliant artists.

641152,5,6303398375,"`Twas boy that killed the beast.  A greedy boy (some would say an extortionist), who felt a cowboy hat and a horse were more important than the lives and property of others.  Ever since I first saw this movie as a kid, I was struck by the fact that it was a mere boy, filled with avarice, who set bedlam into motion.  And!  He got away with it, besides being paid handsomely for not returning that which he stole.  There's a lesson in there somewhere; I just don't know what.  In addition to all this great social commentary, there's the fabulous work of Ray Harryhausen to enjoy.  His creature Ymir is especially masterful.  Harryhausen manages to elicit a lot of sympathy for this poor alien's plight.  Kidnapped, caged, chased, beset upon by a howling hound then men, is it any wonder the creature finally fought back?  A pitchfork in the back will do that.
There are many great scenes in this movie (my favorite is the fight with the poor elephant).  Naturally, a lot of destruction follows the creature's desperate struggle to escape all that man throws at it (which includes flamethrowers and tanks!).  If this sounds like I'm on the beast's side in all this, I am.

The ship limps back to Earth, its crew dying or dead, the ship's hull pierced by a meteoroid, and no control over reentry into Earth's atmosphere, its commander probably did not expect to survive . . . .

But when a village fisherman came to your grandfather's trailer seeking a doctor for the survivors of an aircraft that had ditched in the sea, you jumped at the chance to volunteer.

Your first stint as a doctor didn't go as you had hoped: one patient died and the other was incredibly rude to you.  You are still steaming about it as you walk back to the trailer.

641282,5,6303398375,"1957's 20 Million Miles to Earth is not a bad b-film in its own right.  There is much overacting and stereotyping.  A bunch of Italian fisherman are minding their own business when a silver rocket comes flashing out of the sky and hits the water, a large portion still sticking out of the surface.  Harryhausen's magic starts right away, with the hot, boiling water and the realistic larger than life ship.

The Italian fishermen, along with the silly little boy Pepe, who loves Texas more than common sense, row over there and manage to rescue two men.  The rest are dead.  Washington hears of this and sends people over but with all the back & forth between trying to find the creature sample that was washed ashore and Pepe's silliness is popping open the specimen container and selling it for a cowboy hat, really makes your head spin.

The Ymir grows to fantastic size and he really is a decent creature who really just wants to be left alone.  When a farmer sticks a fork in his back and realizes the creature is not done, he gets slapped silly.  Ymir then runs around the countryside with the military in pursuit.

I recognize a few actors from the b-film era, along with an actor who was later to perform on the sixties show The Time Tunnel (but with hair this time), John Zaremba, who plays Dr. Uhl.  He says such quotable quotes as:
Dr. Judson Uhl: ""Why is it always, always so costly for Man to move from the present to the future?""

This film is not known for its off the wall lines or its great acting but will give Harryhausen fans a thrill and a knowledge that the best is yet to come!

The DVD is very plain.  The current Amazon version here only gives you choices between widescreen and regular dimensions.  Ho hum.  The Ray Harryhausen DVD version from Netflix lets you choose between black & white and the colorized version.  Sacrilege!

641284,4,6303398375,"I think the best thing about this movie is that it's fast-moving. The filmmakers don't waste a lot of time with unnecessary dialog or a sappy romance. They get right to it and stay on track for almost all of the 82 minutes.

Thus, if you like somewhat-hokey 1950s science-fiction movies dealing with space or monsters, or in this case both of them, you should enjoy this little film. Most of it involves trying to cope with a specimen from Venus which quickly grows into a Godzilla-like monster (but smaller).

Here's the good and bad news on the special-effects, which are crucial to a film like this. With Hall of Fame FX man Ray Harryhausen, you know you're going to get the best of what you can expect from a film 50 years ago. Compared to most films of its ilk during the '50s, this is good stuff and the creature looks and moves in a pretty realistic manner. The only ""goof"" is that in some scenes, such as the one in the barn, the monster looks about three feet high in some shots, and 20 feet in others. The scale gets thrown out of whack a few times and then several times later in the film. Thus, you never really know how big this lizard-creature is. Overall, however, it's still done extremely well for its time period.

There is a scene, too, where the alien creature fights an elephant! Once again, for something 50 years old, they did an excellent job re-creating what that fight might look like. It was well done....and how often do you see a monster fighting an elephant?? Pretty cool stuff. By the way, I watched the colorized version and the monster was green.

The acting is passable, too. Hopper, as ""Col. Robert Calder,"" knows what's he doing, as do most others in here. Some of the actors are familiar faces from '50s and '60s television. The female interest - which is played down - has Joan Taylor as ""Marisa Leonardo."" She's a bit bland but not bad-looking. She reminded me of Phyllis Coates, from the first season of ""The Adventures Of Superman.""

All in all, if you're looking for a campy and fun, along with fast-moving classic-era sci-fi flick, this is highly recommended. You won't be bored.",1246752000,,2122,4.530026109660574
641285,5,6303398375,I think this movie is a great all timer. 20 MMTE is a fun Movie. Plus it is even better in Color. I did not know that Joan Taylor was starring w/chuck connors in the Rifleman. RH help supervise the Color process for this Movie & he was very Impressed. If you are a Movie Fan like most of us then you will love to see this one in color. Plus they make it easy for you to switch back to Black & White with the push of a button. I loved doing this. It made it even more Fun to Watch it. I never watch an Interview in its Entirety. I hear what is Important to me then I move on. You can pick up a bit of Info. But not enough to change you Life. They Put that in so that you can basically see how the Filmmaker felt about making the movie. It is good to know how RH got started.,1245369600,,773,3.7195121951219514
641286,5,6303398375,"In the late 60's, I remember Saturday mornings, sitting in my PJ's, eating a bowl of cereal and watching this film(and many like it)on my living room floor! My family didn't have a color set until 1971, so I thought every movie was in B&W. I actually love B&W as it seems to add something to my favotite old horror films like Frankenstein and The Wolfman. On the other hand, Ray Harryhausen's work seems to be made for color, so I was pretty excited to see this.... if it was done right. Not being a fan of colorization, having Ray Harryhausen overseeing this project made a big difference to me.

****The Film****This is one of my favorite monster movies with one of Ray's most memorable creatures. The Ymir is an interesting and cool looking creature from Venus who grows rapidly in Earth's atmosphere. Not since King Kong has an animated monster evoked so much sympathy from it's audience. The film is pretty standard 50's sci-fi, but the FX and Harryhausen's gifts bring this to another level. This is a fun film to watch!

I have bought all of Harryhausen's films on VHS and the original DVD releases and I have now bought these new colorized versions.
Being able to switch from black and white to color was a great feature and it worked perfectly on my DVD player. I must say after seeing this film in B&W 100 times in my life, it was a welcome change to watch it in color. The Ymir and elephant battle is a highlight as there is a huge contrast of color with the grey elephant and the green Ymir.

The Transfer looks really good here, but I thought the old print was excellent too, so your buying this for the color choice and the new extra features which are also excellent. If you have the Sinbad films, you will pretty much have all the features that didn't get carried over on this disc and you will be able to add these new features, plus the commentary with Mr Ray Harryhausen himself to your collection! I found these new versions on sale for $7.00, so the upgrade was worth it for me. I hope The Beast Of 20,000 Fathoms gets this treatment in the near future.

I have heard that some players won't play the disc or do the color change without an annoying display icon on screen, but it I didn't have this problem. The icon would disappear as soon as I pressed the angle key a second time. If you love these films, it's worth looking into for the new features and color choice, the color palate looks perfectly normal and it adds that wow factor back to this classic film!",1227312000,3,2486,4.40958605664488
641287,3,6303398375,"20 Million Miles To Earth is visual effects wizard Ray Harryhausen's 1957 black and white interplanetary King Kong remake, as well as a tribute to his stop motion photography mentor Willis O'Brien. No, it's not a direct analogy, but there are so many scene for scene knockoffs from Kong that one must believe that only Harryhausen could have gotten away with so much theft (read that as `homage') from his mentor without facing a lawsuit. Yes, technically, the film was directed by noted B film maven Nathan Juran (The Seventh Voyage Of Sinbad), but it's a very standard film, wholly carried into the memory by Harryhausen's skills.
  That stated, it's also a very enjoyable film....The film also features a classic 1950s era opening narrative about `SCIENCE!': `Great scientific advances are often times sudden accomplished facts before most of us are dimly aware of them. Breathtakingly unexpected, for example, was the searing flash that announced the atomic age. Equally unexpected was the next gigantic stride, when man moved out of his very orbit to a point more than 20 Million Miles To Earth!' Cue the start of the film! And the end is just as priceless. Didacticism is always good for a guffaw in sci fi films.
  But, 20 Million Miles To Earth offers more than a few condescending chuckles; it offers a glimpse into a not too long ago time when wonder was still enough to propel a film. Nowadays, too many people ruin films by asking questions that the films acknowledge as givens, and need far too many special effects, as they are too lazy to imbue, and actively participate in art. Ray Harryhausen and Nathan Juran's film does more with less than many films that came later, and even if that sentiment is trite, it's also true. And 20 Million Miles To Earth is a highly enjoyable film, no matter how cookie cutter it is. After all, what determines the success of a cookie is not its shape, but its taste, and that comes from its ingredients, not its mold. What Harryhausen had in his best films was a good recipe, and alot of talent, to fit into some very old and familiar molds. Thus why they are still savored to this day, no matter how many times the hand has held such before.",1220486400,2,2192,4.670984455958549
641288,5,6303398375,"The extras on disc 2 (already pointed out in other reviews) are excellent. The colorization is superb.

I, for one, feel so fortunate that Harryhausen is still alive to supervise this colorization and to offer his commentary to this DVD set. This is a must-have for a Harryhausen fan.",1218758400,,423,4.72972972972973

641341,3,6303398375,"Well, while this is another level of brilliance by Ray Harryhausen, it is not one of my favorite movies but I grabbed it because I enjoy watching it from time to time.  Basically this movie got the same treatment that IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA got (see my other review) as far as the colorization and features.  This time, our feature critter crash lands in the sea off Rome and a boy finds a capsule contain a gel like substance, which turns out to be protection for.......our critter, once hatched, our critter begins to grow rapidly because of earth's air supply and soon becomes large enough to be a real pain in the butt and starts wreaking havoc all over Rome.  While entertaining to watch, there are others in the Harryhausen series that are better but that's just a personal opinion.  It is definitely good enough to add to your Sci-Fi Library for sure.",1209945600,2,864,4.554838709677419

I was not disapointed, the film itself is the typical low budget hokum that you would expect from this period.  Though the special effects from Ray Harryhousen are very good for their time.  The colourisation is variable in it's success rate. At it's best it looks like a 50's colour film but, as is often the case with this process, the greens for trees and grass is less than convincing.  Skin tones, often poor in earlier re-colourings are generally pretty good. I certainly did not find the colour distracting.

641347,5,6303398375,"Really fun film, but should be titled 25 Million Miles to Earth, as a Creature from Venus would have to travel at least that far to get to Earth (when our planet and Venus are as close as they get). I can accept colorized movies today as it usually means that they first do High Definition restoration on the black & white version (and offer that option on the dvd as well) before colorizing the film. In this case, the color looks great except for the fleshtones (which, with just about all colorized films that I have seen, they always get skin color a bit yellow, as if everyone has a liver problem -- Can't understand what the problem is with that, because if you can get closer to a real flesh tone, then one is more willing to accept the rest of the colors). At least see the Creature battle the elephant in color! Unlike many such films, this one has action throughout and seldom gets slow. Excellent transfer for this 1957 film -- So, despite some bad science, a dated rocket (in the opening scene) and some 50's hokum, this is an exceptionally good action film for its time and remains so over 50 years later.",1197504000,9,1118,4.3798076923076925

641384,4,6303398375,"The peaceful, humdrum routine of a Sicilian fishing village is shattered when an American rocketship, returning from a deep space voyage to Venus, crashes into nearby waters. Of all the passengers in that ship, only two crew members survive. And one other: a creature *drumroll*  NOT OF THIS WORLD (in fact, it's an unborn specimen from Venus)! The Venusian starts out as this tiny inert thing covered in a hard jelly-like substance and kept in a sealed cylindrical canister, which is then found on shore and opened by a little kid named Pepe (Damn you, Pepe!). It was only a matter of time before the jelly hatches the creature, which starts mewling and growing. Thru the course of the film, it rapidly grows until it surpasses 20 feet. Along the way, it terrorizes the Italian countryside (or, rather, a barn in the countryside) and, for the film's climax, the city of Rome. And it's all Pepe's fault.

Before CG, there was Willis O'Brien (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-1933-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B000EHQTZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong (1933) (Single-Disc Edition)</a>), and then there was Ray Harryhausen. In the 1950s, Ray Harryhausen's career blossomed as he was assigned special effects duties for several well received science-fiction motion pictures.

At 82 minutes and given the constraints of a low budget and mediocre actors, this picture strived its darndest to please and entertain. That it succeeds is largely thanks to the talents of Ray Harryhausen. Nowadays, this picture is not only a nostalgic blast from the past, it's also a modest, long-ago signpost to this cinematic genius's enduring brilliance and hard work.

No, 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH is probably not as well known or as celebrated as his later pictures&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-and-the-Argonauts/dp/0767810864/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason and the Argonauts</a>&nbsp;(1963) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B00005JKO7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>&nbsp;(1981), but, in the acting category, I'd put up Harryhausen's Venusian monster against the feature creatures in those Greek myth pictures. In watching this film, don't be too surprised if you find yourself rooting just a bit for the creature. Harryhausen certainly imbues it with enough expressiveness to make it empathetic. It isn't really evil as much as governed by its natural impulses. And, as the good Colonel mentions: ""Actually, they're not ferocious unless provoked."" So what does the Colonel do moments later? He starts poking it with a pole. Later, he opens fire on it. Speaking of the male lead, William Hopper is woodenly heroic as U.S. Army Colonel Robert Calder. The token love interest is played with eyebrow-arching panache by Joan Taylor as Marisa Leonardo, a doctor-in-training. But enough about the live actors, it's not really about them.

The special effects here might seem goofy now, but back then they were considered state-of-the-art stuff. Ray Harryhausen, I didn't know who he was when I was growing up, but he had a hand in so many of the pictures I saw as a kid that the artistry and ""feel"" of his work couldn't help but make an impact. He's given me a lot of good childhood memories, and he's yet another reason why I love fantasy and sci-fi so much (along with E.R. Burroughs, C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, and, yes, comic books). I kind of associate him with Tang (yes, Tang!), a glass of which my mom used to hand me as she parked me in front of the idiot box. Every now and then, a Harryhausen product would pop up on TV and vividly transport me to adventure. For my money, better than a video game.

Two paragraphs about the extras on the discs. For the 50th anniversary of this film, they went all out with the bonus features, and if you're a Harryhausen fan, prepare to jump up and down and go ""Yay."" On disc 1 there's the option of viewing the film either in color or in the original black & white (I liked 'em both). Or, if you're any kind of curious or crazy, there's a function on your remote which allows you to switch the movie from color to B&W and vicy-versy. Harryhausen is quoted as being ""tickled pink"" to finally have this film in color, having always wanted it to be in color but originally hampered by the low budget. For the icing on the cake, there's the fantastic, must-hear audio film commentary provided by Ray Harryhausen and others (the disc being worth it alone for Ray's insights re the making of this film).

Disc 2 offers the fun 26-minute-long ""Remembering 20 Million Miles to Earth"" - which includes lots of Harryhausen speaking on camera. Also enjoyable is Tim Burton chatting it up with Harryhausen and a separate interview with actress Joan Taylor. There are cool photos and poster art galleries. An interesting 17-minute Original Ad Artwork segment, in which a producer explains how, way back when, advertising art was used by the theater to promote a film; this guy, to get his points across, uses Ray's films for Columbia Pictures as examples: IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH, and their respective ad art. Extra Features which I wasn't into are The Colorization Process, David Schecter on film music's unsung hero, and the dull ""20 Million Miles More"" comic book.

Several scene SPOILERS in the following paragraph:

What probably wowwed me the most in this film when I saw it years ago is the scene in which Marisa and her father first set eyes on the then newborn creature. It's a treat in dramatic lighting and dazzlingly integrated stop-motion animation. I couldn't articulate that back then; all I knew was that that sequence awed the shiznit out of me. Also holding up well is the creature attack in the barn as it takes on a dog and an armed Italian (but, no worries, no dogs or Italians were harmed in the making of this film). And then there's the main event, a creature tussle featuring the Venusian monster vs. a rampaging elephant.

SPOILERS end.

I can't get over how talented and meticulous and patient Ray Harryhausen was and is at his craft. His knack for seamlessly weaving in his creatures with the live actors and into the story arc itself is astounding. Frame after frame after frame of delicately, precisely adjusted movement pays off, resulting in clay puppets with souls and personalities. I felt for this visitor from Venus, who never asked to be brought to our planet. Tough break for the creature, it never was really given a chance. From the start, we all knew the foregone conclusion: the monster had to die. Damn you, Pepe.",1193184000,2,7382,5.490316901408451
641385,1,6303398375,"This is a great movie, and I enjoy the colorization.  But it is all ruined by the fact that I have a black box hanging prominently in front of the picture. It's the ""angle"" icon, letting me know I can hit the angle key to see a different view.  I checked the owners manual of my Samsung DVD (brand new!) and there was NO option given to remove this marker.  It stays on the screen whether I am watching in B&W or in color, and is totally distracting.  It ruins the DVD for me.
I'm sure Sony would say that this is an issue with my DVD player, not the DVD, but I disagree.  I have checked online, and found that MANY people with many DVD players have this same problem.  With this problem so widespread, the least they could have done was to include a copy without ""chromachoice"" on the second disk of the package.
The novelty of switching back and forth between B&W and color (how many times do you really want to do that?) hardly makes up for the fact that this option totally ruins the viewing experience for many who buy the DVD.",1191456000,6,1032,4.213197969543147
641386,5,6303398375,"Nice release from Columbia Pictures. Totally awesome how you could toggle between the black and white and color print. I have no problems with angle operation on my sony dvd player. Beautiful widescreen 1:85 ratio. Ray Harryhausen did a superb job supervising the color transfer of this great sci-fi film. The high definition tranfer looks really sharp. The Ymir looks great in its original green color. Sicily looks vibrant in color and so does the Colliseum during the finale. I remember seeing the horrble color transfer in the 1933 King Kong and was horrified at seeing a pink Tyrannosaurus Rex, the transfer was either badly supervised or the negatives were just to old to really copy and transfer to color. I really like the transfer to color in ""20 Million Miles To Earth (50th Anniversary Edition)"", the reason I say this is because remember when the Italian and American armies are searching for the Ymir, you see Italian army troopers walking with dogs trying to sniff the Ymir out. As you watch this scene in color you could see for the first time how the sun was set for that time of day during the actual film shoot. You actually get an idea of the time of day this scene was shot. Obviously you could never tell this with the B+W print. It really gave me a whole new outlook on how I watch this film in color from now on. I'm like many people I am against the colorization of original B+W films, but I will say when film directors or historians do a color transfer they should follow the steps and care the way ""20 Million Miles To Earth Dvd(50th Anniversary Edition)"" was done. The Ymir though not charasmatic, shows alot of quizzical wonder and curiousity for a space monster. I do like the Ymirs screaming growl, really authentic and really out there, the Ymirs loud scream is beautiful to hear in Dolby Digital, especially hearing classical music composer Mischa Bakaleinikoffs beautiful music soundtrack, DA,DA,DA,DAAAAAAAAA!!!!. The extras are plentiful as ""The Interview With Joan Taylor"" is really facinating. An interview with the genius himself Ray Harryhausen, David Shechters interview on unsung classical musical composer Mischa Bakaleinikoff, Ad artwork, video photo galleries and ""20 Million MilesTo Earth comic book"", Dolby Digital sound make this dvd release a must have for any sci-fi fan.",1190592000,,2321,4.893401015228426
641387,5,6303398375,"Although not as impressive as his later, more popular films, Ray Harryhausen's work on 20 Million Miles to Earth is still marvelous entertainment.  And now, here comes a super-deluxe package of not only the film, but a wealth of supplemental material for fans to enjoy.

But first, let's get this ""colorization"" business out of the way.  I've never understood some people's disdain for black & white movies.  And I think 20 Million looked just fine in its original form.  Having said that, it's important to realize that Harryhausen himself participated in the process, so it has his full approval.  In fact, in the 20-minute documentary on Disc 2, Harryhausen states he would have made ALL his Columbia pictures of the fifties in color if he'd been given the budget.  So, even though I'm a purist at heart, it doesn't really bother me that the film has been colorized.  As for the result, the color looks no better or worse than other films of the same era that were filmed in color.  And the disc gives you the options of viewing the film in its original black & white.

The master himself comes off sharp as a tack in the various interview segments.  It's amazing that this man, well into his eighties, has such vivid recollections of films he made over 50 years ago.  Director Tim Burton sits down with Harryhausen and shows how much of a fan he (Burton) himself is, asking questions we all would ask if we had the same opportunity.  Other filmmakers such as Terry Gilliam and Rick Baker offer their experiences with Ray's films as well.  Burton and Gilliam, directors known for their visual styles, point out that the films' still-impressive special effects often overshadowed the limited acting abilities of their stars.  Actress Joan Taylor (who starred in 20 Million and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers) also has fond memories of the films, and looks great for a woman in her seventies.

Rounding out the extra features are a gallery of ad artwork, one of Harryhausen's original sketches, a comic book teaser ""20 Million Miles More,"" and featurettes on the film's music and the colorization process.  Curiously, the original theatrical trailer (which was included on Columbia's previous single-disc release) is omitted.  In its place are trailer for ""Labyrinth"" and ""The Dark Crystal.""

I suspect die-hard fans will still be put-off by the colorization idea.  However, this 2-disc set has so much more to offer, plus the aforementioned ability to view the film in its original form.  It's definitely worth picking up.",1189814400,,2522,4.8870588235294115
641388,5,6303398375,"With very few exceptions, movies are considered the ""property"" of either
the director or the leading actor/actoress.  Ray Harryhausen is one of
those few exceptions.

His master craftsmanship in the use of stop-motion photopgraphy as a special-effect propells Mr. Harryhausen far above anything produced
at a computer work-station, in as much as that he wasn't striving
for ""realism"" in his efforts; Mr. Harryhausen was just giving form to the
viewers' imagination while extending their 'suspension of disbelief'.  The
Oscar he received for his work on ""Jason and the Argonauts"" was both well
earned and well deserved.

""20 Million Miles To Earth"", as well as Mr. Harryhausen's earlier works,
doesn't have much of a plot, but quite frankly, it doesn't need one.  His
special-effects are more than adequate to please the pallate of this genre's collector.  To emphasise my point, when Mr. Harryhausen put as
much effort into the plot, as well as the special-effects, he earned his
*first* Oscar, for ""Jason and the Argonauts"".

(Consult your DVD player's manual for details.) Incidentally, even with the icon no longer visible, you can still toggle between the B&W and color versions of the film by pressing the Angle button on your remote.

Now, what about the movie itself? I always liked it a lot in its original black and white, and was skeptical about a colorized version. But the colors are really terrific - vivid blues and greens, fairly natural skin tones, and decent texture and detail. Colorization has come a long way. For the most part, you may not even realize that the film is colorized, although there are occasional giveaways if you look hard enough.

I'm surprised to say that I like ""20 Million"" even better in color than I did in B&W. The turquouise Mediterranean skies and colorful Italian backdrops add variety to the film. The action sequences are more spectacular. (For instance, the scene where the Ymir emerges from the Tiber is far more effective in color, and the battle with the elephant works better too.) The night sequences benefit the least from colorizing, but aren't harmed by it. The fact that Ray Harryhausen gave his imprimatur to this release lends it added credibility.

Overall, I'm very happy with this disc, and I hope other B&W sci-fi/fantasy films from the '50s are given the same high-quality treatment. (If you're still undecided, clips of ""20 Million"" are available for preview on the Sony website.)",1188864000,3,1758,4.814569536423841

When I learned that the Master himself was supervising the color scheme of his own film, I was estatic! Simply put, the color version is spectacular! Legend Films did a tremendous job with their computer colorization technique. This is the best transfer,in terms of depth and clarity I've seen. I have the Criterion laserdisc version and the most recent black & white DVD version. The 50th Anniversary Edition blows those away! The color looks so natural and exact that you'd think it was shot in color. What's really amazing is how much more Alien the Ymir appears. In B&W the Creature blends with all the other life forms..In color It stands out as truely not of this Earth. Another cool effect the color brings out is the blood on the elephant during the clash with the Ymir. It creates a real viceral feeling as opposed to the black color in the original version. The bonus disc does not dissapoint. Wonderful interviews and commentaries from Ray's many admirers and the fantastic recollections from Ray are worth the price of admission. I can't wait to get ahold of his other movies now being colorized. I noticed that many reviews point out that there is a toggle icon that stays on the screen. I don't get that on my screen at all.

641445,4,6303398375,"Once again AMAZON upped the anti and said I had to purchase something to write reviews again, so I decided to get this. I remember when I was a child catching this movie several times on tv at the near end, where the helicoptors drop the electrified net on a giant scaly monster that eventually fights an elephant. But I never knew the title. So whenever the title 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH popped up on my TV screen, I just dismissed it as a boring space adventure. It was a few years later I came across an issue of FAMOUS MONSTERS of Filmland (remember that one?) and right there is a picture of a monster fighting an elephant with the caption  "" Ymir from 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH"". Boy! was I mad at all the times I passed up a chance to watch this. This was way before VCRs and especially before DVD players. If you missed something on tv, YOU MISSED IT. You were at the mercy of the station director if they chose to air it again anytime soon, if at all. Thank God for DVD players and the sane heads that choose to release classic films and TV series. As for the dvd itself. I just want to share my experience with you. I usually keep the tint on my TV at zero between red and green. I only have one button, some TVs have two. If I go a few clicks to the red, the flesh tones become more convincing, but the ocean and sky wind up looking more of a turquoise. When I go into the green side of the tint, the ocean and the sky gets a very realistic shade of blue, but the flesh tones look like the actors have jaundice. Maybe your tv will give you a better result. I also wish the 1.33:1 fullscreen version was included, because the 1.85:1 of this dvd is not true widescreen. It is simply a cropped version of the fullscreen presentation. The chromachoice (color/ black & white) works very easily for me. Just press the angle button twice and the picture changes from whatever mode you're watching it in. While the angle icon is diplayed all you need to do is click it once and you can keep going back and forth from color to B & W all you want. A foolish thing to do? Yes, but it can be done. The angle icon does go away after a few second for my player. Overall this is still a great dvd to own. It has a nice sharp picture and lots of bonus features.

Boy, was I wrong! This is great stuff! This movie looks better than a lot of the ""true"" color films that were made in the same period. Legend Films has totally reversed my opinion of the colorization process and I eagerly await the next two Harryhausen releases. My only regret is that they're not scheduled to do ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". There are still movies that I would not want to see colorized (""Psycho"", the original ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"", etc.), but these ""fun"" movies from the fifties can really benefit from this new process.

Best examples, Bewitched Season 2, Sherlock Holmes movies, and I Dream Of Jeanie Season 1.  The color in 20 Million Miles is accurate and totally real looking.  Any movie that's colorized is a vast improvement over the drab dated look of a b/w movie.  Now that Colorization has been absolutely perfected, it's time for the purists and snobs out there who have been trying to kill colorization for years to admit the truth.  Any colorized movie is better than a b/w version.  Now, this is esp. for you snobs out there who refuse to admit the obvious benefits of colorization.  I now want to see Citizen Kane in color!!

641452,5,6303398375,"I've just finished watching this 2 disc *COLORIZED* & B&W 50TH ANNIVERSARY SET, released July 31, 2007. I, like many other RAY HARRYHAUSEN fans already have the originally released SINGLE DISC DVD's of his movies (in that case the cover for 20MMTE has the Ymir image over orange ""rings""). Is this worth an upgrade? How's the colorization? I'll try to cover this reviewer's opinions on that.

COLORIZATION: THE *MAIN* reason to get this IMHO is to see what a ""sanctioned"" colorization of an RH B&W  film looks like. FOR THE RECORD: Typically, I am more of a ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" kinda guy. In this case, even with RH's blessings, I didn't think 20M *needed* coloring, but I sure wasn't going to argue if the option to get a B&W print of the film was in the same DVD release, which it is. It should be noted here, that while watching this in color, if for any reason you feel too jarred by the whole process, you can switch to the original B&W print SEAMLESSLY via the ""ANGLE"" button on your remote (so called ""CHROMACHOICE"")....pretty cool, and this function should be made available on ANY future colorized/re-edited film if ya ask me. I spent the first part of the movie tinkering with this to see the differences. RH has green lit and is totally part of this coloring thing so that is cool. Someone pointed out and asked why is it OK for RH to tinker with his old stuff and not GEORGE LUCAS  (RH said if they had the budget, these B&W films would've been in color)....well....HERE, they give us the option of EITHER to watch. Something LUCAS did not originally do, yet insisted with the revisions, that those were THE PRINTS TO WATCH. HERE, it is like watching an old master revisit an old project and watching him tinker with it, yet we still can control how we ""percieve"" the film (i.e. the way it was, or way it could've been....for those who must hold onto those precious childhood memories EXACTLY as they were...cuz you know you were sitting at home watching these on a DIGITAL WS TV back then...lol;-).

HOW'S THE COLOR?: If you saw the TURNER COLORIZED 1933 KING KONG and were horrified at the PINK TYRANNOSAURUS, then fear not. According to Legend Films, the process is now refined, new system etc etc, and those old school colorization horrors are no more. But the proof is in the viewing. YES, the process is MUCH, MUCH BETTER. I've picked up a number of LEGEND FILMS's other colorized releases (CARNIVAL OF SOULS, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILLS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD etc) because the colorization was decent and had the (pretty darn good) B&W masters on them as well. HERE, it is the BEST I've seen the process. Of course, when talking colorization, the film, no matter how good the technology, STILL LOOKS LIKE THE OLD TINTED PHOTOS YOU USED TO SEE IN OLD MAGAZINES & ADS. But then, that is what you get, tinting B&W, so it is essentially part of the look. Growing up on old school stuff, this tinting thing was cool to me so seeing a film this way was never such a big shock to me as it is to some. But again, so long as the option to see the original is there. IF this is what to expect in future RH films, I'll certainly pick up the rest. The colors feel more lush....flesh looks MORE LIKE FLESH, it's still somewhat flat, but there's a richness not present in other colorized films I've seen, and sorry to the purists, the YMIR (the monster) is just cool to see in color finally even if his fins and other lighter details appear a little flat & dulled. I always wondered as a kid what he looked like in color. Many old lobby cards were tinted so this just keeps in line with those, so it works AS A VIEWING OPTION to me.

THE B&W PRINT: Honestly, if you have the original DVD release of this, you may want to rent this first to see if this film is important enough for you to upgrade. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES, i.e. this release appears to have the best of the two DVD released prints, it feels cleaner, BUT, I think those details/plusses will be lost if you have a regular TV to watch this on. I am using a HD WIDESCREEN/LCD and upsampling via HDMI (a glamorous version of ""standard"" lol!;-) so I can't tell you what the differences would be in standard viewing, but I can't see them being all THAT different to warrant an upgrade, UNLESS like myself you want to see the novelty of colorization at work. The original (orange cover) release had a really good print on it to begin with so I never felt this was needing an upgrade.

BOTH FILM VERSIONS ARE ASPECT RATIO- 1.85:1 ANAMORPHIC. Remastered in HI-DEF. 165min. total. Apparently this was sourced from a different/better source print from Columbia/Sony vaults. SF's are WS.

SPECIAL FEATURES: GONE from before are the HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES thankfully, which was on nearly every d@mn RH DVD. Nice the first time, but 5 DVD's in, it was tired. HERE,  there's the commentary track which is cool in some parts, but it starts feeling like a plug for the colorization process and fan worship....hearing RH proclaim how the colorization just brings the movie to life repeatedly was a little bothersome, since it is cool/interesting, but hey, it's still a colorization of an originally B&W film, no matter WHOM sanctions the process....but this is RH's film, so I gotta give a little room here. And though I think RH has gone from cult fan favorite to (much deserved) mainstream praise, as another reviewer stated, this praise has started to turn into overkill when having to listen to it, as is the case here. The commentary is riddled with praising of the emotive qualities of the animation work (which is deserved) but after hearing this over and over, the praise just becomes more kissy-kissy feeling than genuine. But then, many RH fans have thought highly of his work already and recognized these qualities so it's like preaching to the choir, so having it beaten into our heads for a whole discs worth of SPECIAL FEATURES becomes a little tedious.

The MAIN SPECIAL FEATURE is 'REMEMBERING 20MMTE""......which was pretty cool to watch a feature just on the film. It was also nice to hear TERRY GILLIUM (Director whose name I can't rememeber how to spell right this second), but hearing him actually say the main reason to watch an RH film was the animation since most of the acting was wooden....lol! I almost can't believe they left that in, but how true! TIM BURTON'S segment was cool the first several minutes.....nice to see him be just a fanboy. But that got long. I also noticed here, that much of the RH features are starting to become retellings of the same stories I've heard over and over. I'm not really complaining, but rehashing is rehashing....and I understand some people aren't buying every d@mn disc like some of us are (*ahem*ahem*). TIM BURTON's piece was welcome though. The JOAN TAYLOR INTERVIEW was a little long considering it is not focused TOTALLY on RH (understandably), though interesting to hear her film background. AND WOW....SHE IS STILL A BEAUTY. Her endcap praise of RH was very nice and shows what a long way in terms of respect RH has come since he started. It's almost odd to hear people didn't really have a clue about what he was doing and the craftsmanship this one man show was up to back in the day.

DAVID SCHECTER's FILM MUSIC UNSUNG HERO piece on the composer whose long name escapes me, but the guy who scored this and other B-movies, mostly the monster theme scores was surprisingly interesting to me since I almost passed on viewing it. That provided some excellent bits of info on the scoring process. But it became waaaaay too much info for me after awhile, my brain started losing places to save all this trivia.

COLORIZATION FEATURE: Interesting to see the process described, though that felt a little self congratulatory, falling into the OK, I GET IT, COLORIZATION HAS COME A LONG WAY category of overkill ideas to pound into the viewer's heads. But still.....interesting to watch, and RH is in this.

OVERALL: This was worth an upgrade for me. The coloring was as excellent as could be, and I won't scream about touching an old B&W film, since the option for watching either is here. You can be sure if LEGEND releases KING KONG colored (their way) I'll pick it up. The praise of RH seems a bit redundant (but AGAIN, this is from someone who's felt he's had this a long time coming and doesn't need to be brought up to speed), but it seems now like every release is trying to catch the rest of the world up with RH's greatness as a creator, so it sometimes is hard to watch as a true diehard RH fan who doesn't need to be told this. The technical stuff is informative.....the old stories etc etc.....but I have to wonder how the next colored releases will fare in terms of content (EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCCERS, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA) since the process (both animation AND colorization are described in depth here). ALSO, the old stories.........is there really any fresh info to be gleaned at this point? And where are the deleted scenes....even millisecond animation cutting room floor tidbits...anything. Guess we'll see.

But THANKS TO SONY/LEGEND for making an overall, really good DVD release of this film. I'm certainly NOT complaining that I snuck away at lunch yesterday to pick this up:-)  !!! IF I just discovered RH, this would be an excellent package. It still holds up well for us diehards....at least this one. Hope this helps some of you out there!

PS: And BTW: AMAZON so far seems to have the best price if you can wait and order online.
PSS: And since I believe Amazon's reviews are PRODUCT REVIEWS, my stars are based on my feelings toward this as a package. THE FILM ITSELF IS MORE LIKE A 3.75/4 (sorry....the acting is fabulously atrocious in parts).",1185926400,108,9714,4.597230236583958
641453,4,6303398375,"I saw a screening of this film at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 27, 2007.  If you didn't know this film wasn't originally in color, I don't think you could tell.  The colors look great.  Flesh tones, which gave previous colorizations a lot of trouble, look very natural.  The colors in general are very natural, looking very much like colors used in similar films from the 1950s.  In the process of colorization, the producers were also able to take out some matte lines and generally clean up the images, making this a very nice print to see and enjoy.  I am looking forward to getting the DVD with Ray Harryhausen's extended commentary.  Mr. Harryhausen was at the San Diego screening providing live commentary, but it was fairly minimal.  It's always a joy to see any film by Ray Harryhausen, and this film can be enjoyed even more now that it is in color the way it was originally intended.",1185753600,6,896,4.55625

When I read recently that Harryhausen is doing a colorized version of 20 Million Miles to Earth and that he plans on doing that to his other titles, I felt concerned.  The reason for this isn't that I am anti-colorization (which I am), but rather when it was announced that the classic She was to be colorized, I fell into my, ""No black and white movies should be colorized.""  However, when I read that Harryhausen would supervise it, I felt this was a man of respect and maybe it will turn out to be okay.  Unfortunately, the colorization of She wasn't much different that the previous films we have seen go through that terrible process.  I was only grateful that the She edition also contained a new black and white print on it.  But now he is doing it again with 20 Million and will do it with others of his.  Since these were movies that he had a hand in, I guess he may have a right.  But after the experience of She only several months ago, I hold no hopes on the future products.  I only hope he will always have a b&w new print on the DVD as well.",1185753600,4,1171,4.146017699115045
641505,5,6303398375,"Like most people, I am generally against colorization. However, there is one situation where I am willing to keep an open mind. The exception is where a movie might have been filmed in color had the budget not been the overriding factor. This is why I think you must never colorize Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but you might consider colorizing Miracle On 34th Street or......20 Million Miles To Earth.

From what I understand, 20 Million Miles To Earth would have been filmed in color had there been enough of a budget to allow it. It is entirely possible that the film will not look good in color. There have been as many technical problems with colorization as there have been aesthetic issues, such as the way colors seem to run during quick sideways motion.

However, the fact that the legendary Ray Harryhausen is supervising the colorization of one of his earlier features makes this one of the most promising experiments in the dubious history of colorization. This is not Ted Turner with a Venus Paradise Coloring Set. This is one more opportunity to see a master put his stamp on something, as we saw with the Early Harryhausen DVD triumph of a few years ago.

I'm looking forward to see how this all works out. If it doesn't, perhaps it will spell the death of Colorization. Sounds like a win-win proposition to me.",1185580800,5,1325,4.6781115879828326

641509,4,6303398375,"From Columbia Pictures and the Ray Harryhausen Signature Collection comes the science fiction thriller 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957) aka The Beast from Space aka The Giant Ymir, which would be special effects pioneer Harryhausen's last black an white feature.  Directed by Nathan Juran (Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad), the film stars William Hopper (The Bad Seed, The Deadly Mantis), son of gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and Joan Taylor (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers).  Also appearing is Frank Puglia (The Black Orchid), John Zaremba (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers), Tito Vuolo (Dragstrip Girl), and Thomas Browne Henry (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers).

As the film begins we're off the coast of a dinky, little fishing village in Italy, one that's startled by the arrival of a strange ship from the sky.  The rather large and odd craft crashes into the Mediterranean (there's a ginormous hole in the side of the ship), and eventually two men are rescued from its interior by some plucky, stereotypical Italian characters before sinking into the ocean.  Turns out one of the men is Colonel Robert `Bob' Calder (Hopper), a United States air force pilot, and he's just returned from a trip to...Venus!  Anyway, after the crash, a young boy finds a cylinder from the ship on the beach, and he proceeds to sell its contents to a traveling zoologist named Dr. Leonardo (Puglia), whose granddaughter, named Marisa (Taylor), just happens to be a medical student and is called upon to aid the two survivors (the one who isn't Calder soon passes away from a severe case of space acne).  Anyway, turns out the cylinder contained an alien life form, one that soon grows into a miniature Kraken, the kind similar to the one from the film Clash of the Titans (1981).  Dr. Leonardo is amazed at `his' discovery, but guess what?  The creature grows at an extraordinary rate, and soon escapes, terrorizing livestock across the Italian countryside.  Calder and some military types give chase, but the alien beast, who is now the size of a man, is quite wily and manages to elude capture.  The beast is eventually caught and taken to the zoo in Rome for study, that is until a mishap allows it to escape and go on an insane rampage through the streets of Rome (but not before fighting an elephant...woo hoo!), it's size now approximately about 50 feet tall (seems exposure to our atmosphere has some to do with the creature's rapid growth).  Calder calls in for firepower, and the Italian army makes the scene, all leading up to a final confrontation at Rome's famous Coliseum, which seems somewhat appropriate...

I'll tell you straight up the story here isn't all that hot, and the writing, in terms of the dialogue, is generally pretty ridiculous, but the special effects are top notch, and features some of Harryhausen's best work, in my opinion.  The great thing is the creature appears quite early in the film, and then continues to be present throughout, all the way up until the end, in varying sizes.  As far as the actual characters go, they're all fairly standard, including Hopper's manly, sometimes misogynistic hero type and Taylor's comely female who eventually catches the eye of the hero.  The latter was somewhat interesting at first as she seemed to buck the trend in sci-fi films of the time in that she seemed a strong willed, opinionated, female character, one who was studying to be a doctor (not a nurse), but soon enough she gets all chummy with the hero, as it seems few could resist his sheer, unadulterated manliness.  I suppose it matters little as her character really had no real purpose in the film other than to provide for a female presence.  There are some really, unintentionally funny bits throughout, probably the best occurring when Calder and some locals chase the creature down early on into a barn.  Calder, who apparently had some experience with the creature back on its home planet, tells the others it won't attack unless provoked.  After doing so Calder then proceeds to jab the man-sized beast with a pole, trying to force it into a wooden cart (I guess jabbing at it with a pointy, wooden stick isn't considered provoking).  Now realize only a short time prior the creature had escaped from Dr. Leonardo, who had been keeping it in an iron-barred cage, which it tore apart easily, so trying to capture it in a wooden cage seemed pointless.  Another really funny part comes after the capture of the creature and the military decides to hold a press conference and spills the beans to the world.  During the conference, after being told of the semi-successful mission to Venus, one ace reporter comes forth idiotically with the following...""Venus?  The planet Venus?""  Another part that sticks out in my mind...near the end, as the creature, who's quite large now, is rampaging through Rome, Calder's following it in a car, apparently trying to keep tabs on it.  For some reason, at one point, he rams it with his car...now I was unsure the purpose of this action, but it seemed to me not such a hot idea to angry up the rather large beast by plowing into it with an automobile (hey, let's see how ticked off we can get it).  But seriously, the main reason to see this film is for the effects work, which mainly consists of stop motion animation.  I did develop some sympathy for the beast, given the fact it was a hapless victim of circumstances beyond its control, but not so much that I minded the army trying to blast the hell of it.  The special effects work is exquisite here, and while it may appear hokey by today's standards, know that at the time, this was state of the art stuff, and no one did it better than Harryhausen, who influenced so many of the effects artists working in the industry today (you ask any of them of their influences, and they invariably mention a Harryhausen film).  It should also be known that the type of animation present here took months to achieve, requiring patience and eye towards detail few other than Harryhausen possessed.

The picture, available in both widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) and fullscreen (1.33:1), looks decent for the most part, although there is some graininess present at times, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through well enough.  As far as extras there's the usual featurettes `This is Dynamation' and The Harryhausen Chronicles, both of which appear on any number of other Harryhausen DVD releases.  Also included are subtitles in English and French, and a trailer for this film along with in for The 3 Worlds of Gulliver (1960).

By the way, if you're interested in picking up this feature, I might recommend looking into purchasing a DVD set entitled The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen - Legendary Science Fiction Series as it contains the following It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955), Earth vs. the Flying Saucer (1956), 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957), Mysterious Island (1961), and H.G. Wells' First Men in the Moon (1964), all at a price considerable less than buying the features separately.",1166400000,2,7046,4.809444904722453
641510,5,6303398375,"""20 Million Miles to Earth"" is a sci-fi adventure set in and around Italy, filmed in black and white (1957) and fuelled by the stop motion effects of Ray Harryhausen. It was really enjoyable, I thought.

Man has sent the first men to Venus, and they've just returned, crash landing in the sea off Sicily. Out of the seventeen crew, only two have survived, and one of those is sick thanks to Venus' poisonous atmosphere, despite the fact they had the best respiratory gear provided. None of it had worked against the toxicity. The astronauts have discovered exciting things on Venus. There are minerals there that could be of great benefit to mankind, and the astronauts are eager to set mines there in the future. However, they'll need to overcome the poisoned air, and they have a feeling a lifeform they brought with them may shed some light on how to cope. It is a reptilian creature native to Venus that stands like a man, a beast that feeds on sulfur. Unfortunately, the creature was lost in the crash, washed up in it's pod on the beach, and sold off to a local biologist. In a cleaner atmosphere, the creature doubles in size each day, and though its usually peaceful could prove to be quite dangerous if provoked. Will the beast be recaptured?

It's a simple story, but Ray Harryhausen's dynamation, the Italian location, the sci-fi concepts and the themes make things special and keep things very interesting. The creature has an interesting look. Though he's sometimes violent, he has this nervousness in his eyes which makes you think. The creature only retaliates if something is violent to it first, yet the reason the creature is attacked more and more (and why it retaliates more and more) is because of its violent acts. It's an interesting look at violence, retaliation and curiousity, if you're in the mood for a think.

Special features on the DVD include an original 1950s theatrical trailer  of the film, an original 1950s ""This is Dynamation"" featurette (featuring footage from ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"") and the hour long documentary ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"", narrated by Leonard Nimoy and featuring not only interviews from Ray Harryhausen and famous fans like Geroge Lucas, but lots of Harryhausen's stop motion footage, including some rare and unused pieces. These features are available on some of the other Harryhausen DVDs (like ""Mysterious Island"", for instance) but they are still interesting.

Worth seeing for fans of sci-fi and Ray Harryhousen.",1163462400,,2487,4.940191387559809

641554,5,6303398375,"Released in June 1957, ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" is an important film in the canon of visual effects genius Ray Harryhausen. It was the last of the black and white science-fiction films he worked on during the 50s. It was also the first film based on one of his own ideas. It set the stage for his color fantasy films triumphs that would follow.
Harryhausen had originally developed a story about the frost giant Ymir from Norse mythology. He then changed the creature to a cyclops-satyr mix from another planet who rampages on modern Earth, but still kept the name Ymir. (The Cyclops-satyr would later show up in ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad."") When the film finally went before the cameras, the Ymir had become a humanoid-reptilian beast from Venus. Brought to Earth in a crashed rocket, the Ymir emerges as only a few inches high, but starts growing rapidly in the Earth's atmosphere. Originally peaceful, the Ymir is provoked into violence by frightened humans. The movie climaxes in Rome when the captive Ymir bursts loose and starts smashing famous monuments in the Eternal City.
The parallels to King Kong are obvious, and Harryhausen intended the Ymir to also be a sympathetic, misunderstood creature. He succeeded grandly: ""20 Millions Miles to Earth"" is Harryhausen's best early film. The direction from Nathan Juran and the human actors are perfunctory and clichd, but the effects are still stunning today, and the Ymir is a superb actor. Designed along human lines, but with dinosaur features, the Ymir elicits strong emotions and exudes tremendous personality. The scene of it hatching from its `pod' (made of gelatin) and exploring the strange world around it for the first time is one of the high points of Harryhausen's career, and a sequence of which he rightly feels great pride. The scene of the full-sized, fifteen-foot Ymir wrestling an elephant (also animated) is also a stunning piece of work.
(Harryhausen's love of the Ymir extended to late in his career. In his last film, ""The Clash of the Titans,"" he used the Ymir as the basis for the design of the multiple-armed monster the Kraken -- the heads and bodies are almost the same.)
The DVD presents the film in widescreen format for the first time since its theatrical release. The image is crystal clear and lets Harryhausen's work shine. There are a few extras. ""The Harryhausen Chronicles,"" a lengthy documentary, does an excellent overview of the man's career. This same documentary appears on most of Columbia's Harryhausen DVDs, so if you're a fan of the animator you've probably seen this before. Also included is a vintage featurette about the animation process, called ""This is Dynamation."" It was made for the release of ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad,"" so it actually has nothing to do with ""20 Million Miles to Earth.""
This is a must-have DVD for any Harryhausen fan and any admirer of 50s science fiction. It's one of the highlights of giant monster cinema.",1085443200,18,2944,4.901803607214429
641555,5,6303398375,"Really only one word can describe this film: awesome! Everything about this movie is awesome! And this is no ordinary monster movie from the 50s. Harryhausen and the film crew took very special care in making this film. While it is a B movie, it doesn't seem like it. The story is well written and the Ymir is a monster that you will love and sympathize for rather than hating him. The only complaint I have about the film is that the Ymir didn't get as much screen time as he should have. But the ending of the film is worth it since he is in just about every scene within the last ten or so minutes.
The acting is decent but nothing worth applauding about. A little Italian kid gets annoying during the first half of the movie.
Overall, it's a classic monster film that will really appeal more to die-hard fans of the genre, little kids, and people who grew up watching these movies.",1080432000,,885,4.337349397590361
641556,4,6303398375,"This 1957 sci-fi thriller is most notable because of the continuing genius of Ray Harryhausen and the remarkable creature he gives us.  William Hopper (of Perry Mason fame) is the sole survivor of a Venus expedition which has brough back with it a gellified glob that contains this remarkable creature.  The monster is accidentally sold to a visiting scientist by a little boy (Bart Braverman in his first role).  Lovely daughter Joan Taylor (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers) happens to be a medical student.  The monster hatches, a cute little thing remarkable in its dexterity and in Harryhausens amazing muscular definition.  Of course it grows, is captured by the army and sedated in Rome.  An electrical malfunction occurs and the now gigantic creature is let loose on Rome.  It fights a huge elephant and then meets its end in the Colosseum.  Hopper is awful in his role, more artificial than the monster.  But it's a fun ride, and what makes this DVD so special is the addition of ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"" which gives us a blow by blow glance at some of Harryhausen's magnificent creations:  the horrifying Medusa in ""Clash of the Titans""; the metal colossus in ""Jason and the Argonauts""; the crab and bee on ""Mysterious Island"" and countless others.
Harryhausen was a genius, working pretty much on his own.  In today's CGI special effects, it's hard to think of only one person being able to create such marvelous fx.

A Venus probe returns to earth with an alien egg. Once it hatches, the earth's atmosphere causes the alien to grow to gigantic proportions. Harryhausen's last B&W film contains his best effects up to 1957. The creature is believable and scary, especially in the barn sequence. The combination of animated monster and real backgrounds is impressive, especially when you consider when this movie was made.
Today teams of men and dozens of computers create effects.  Back in 1957, Harryhausen alone created amazingly lifelike creatures. When you see one of his films, you'll want to see them all.",1072137600,2,796,5.123076923076923
641558,4,6303398375,"There's really not much to this one. Earth sends a spacecraft to Venus, it comes back with an alien life form that starts out at six inches high then grows into a 20-foot beast that wreaks havoc on the city, etc., etc. Character depth? Why bother, this monster has a lot of character on its own. Plot intricacies? What the heck for, the monster is on a rampage and has to be stopped, what more do you want?
That's 50s sci-fi for you. No frills storytelling, and it's darn good fun. But what makes this entry especially enjoyable is, you guessed it, the monster itself. The Ymir (curiously, that name is never mentioned in the film) is another in the long list of stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen's creations. Unlke many of the mythology-based creatures in his other films, this one was entirely his own design, and let me say this, it looks really great. It's a neat mix of reptilian features reminiscent of the dinosaurs and humanoid form with fully-developed and functional arms (a decidedly non-dinosaur feature). Now that's cool.
I mentioned earlier that the monster has a lot of character. It really does. This isn't your basic carnivorous beast that devours any living thing in its path. It feeds on sulphur (!), and is actually non-aggressive. In one unforgettable scene, the Ymir stops and growls at a grazing sheep, then walks right by, leaving the sheep unharmed. (The growl probably translates roughly as, ""excuse me, do you know where I can find some sulphur? You don't? Ok, thank you."")
The problems start when the humans, in their typical fear of what they don't know or understand, set out to destroy the creature. Naturally, it becomes violent. What the humans don't know is, the big guy is really just an unfortunate victim of circumstances that wants to be left alone. But then again, how do you leave a 20-foot Ymir alone?
Speaking of leaving things alone, this was Harryhausen's last black-and-white film. Nobody better even think about releasing a computer-colored version. That would take away so much of the nostalgic enjoyment we classic sci-fi fans get from watching films like this.",1058745600,2,2110,4.847645429362881
641559,4,6303398375,"There is a handful of horror/big bug movies from the 50s that the astute viewer can usually spot right away. A large and dangerous creature is either brought to earth from outer space or is roused from a long state of suspended animation to wreak havoc on a densely populated city. Army units are trucked in to battle the creature and soldiers carrying M1 rifles leap out to face a monster that is given face and form by the master of slow motion animatronics, Ray Harryhausen. In 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH, the obvious dating of the film does not detract from the audience's enjoyment of a creature that curiously enough brings in a number of cinematic subtexts. The first is the punishment that humanity invariably incurs when it dares to Learn Things Man Was Not Meant To Uncover. In this case, a seventeen crewman rocket ship returns from Venus to crash into the sea off Sicily. A tiny reptile/human hybrid survives the crash only to grow every day to outsized proportions. The havoc the reptile dumps on Rome is a not so subtle reminder of the dangers that Prometheus faced when he too tried to steal fire and thunder from the gods. A second subtext is the constant clashing between scientists who wish to study a dangerous creature and the military who wish to kill it for the same reason. Remember in THE THING when scientist Robert Cornthwaite dashed up to the marauding plantman to shout, 'You are wiser than we. They (pointing to the miliary types) wish to kill you.' In 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH, director Nathan Juran tries a clever reverse by having a US Army colonel played by William Hopper take on the politically myopic scientist role who begs the Italian mayor to spare the creature in the name of science. Then finally there is the eternal Hollywood custom of subordinating the educated and lovely female scientist (Joan Taylor) to the two-fisted uniformed manly male (Hopper) so that a romance blossoms even as the creature romps in their very midst.
I had not seen this movie for nearly twenty years until I bought it on VC, and I was astonished at how well I remembered the plot. The special effects by Ray Harryhausen are still second to none. In fact, Harryhausen's genius brought in a final subtext. His ability to make the creature bounce and move gave it a personality that I immediately connected to King Kong. Both were creatures that ruled their respective home planets. Both were neither evil nor amoral. They simply acted in accordance to a nature that humanity refused to acknowledge. And both sought higher ground at the end with each trumpeting out a final roar of defiance before overwhelming military might. The emotions that well up in the one's heart as he sees what happens when strong and independent animals clash against man and his infinitely confusing artificial laws leave one with the unsettling notion that perhaps there really are Things Man Is Not Supposed to Know. 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH says this as well as any film can.",1043280000,,2976,4.725
641560,5,6303398375,"This is one of the better done ""creature features"" of the golden age. The creature has a realistic look and the direction of Juran is very good. The creature is mostly harmless until the human race decides to ""study"" him with the help of bullets, a pitchfork and electric shock. Torturing a creature that grows two or three feet a day is not wise. This they learn as the movie moves along. One of best of the genre.",1035331200,5,415,4.333333333333333
641601,4,6303398375,"""20 Million Miles to Earth"" offers a pair of interesting oddities when it comes to the realm of Fifties science fiction films. First, the monster comes from Venus, which, you have to admit, is pretty unusual. Usually Venus produces beautiful blondes, not reptilian bipeds. Second, the monster runs amuck in Rome, whereas we tend to expect the creature from another planet to wreck havoc on New York (or Tokyo if it is a terrestrial monster). This is a rather low-keyed story, where the chief pleasures are derived from Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion special effects. As our thrilling story begins an American spaceship returns from Venus and crashes off the shore of Sicily. Only one astronaut, Colonel Robert Caulder (William Hopper) survives, to be tended by Marisa Leonardo (Joan Taylor) an almost doctor, who feels no need to feign an Italian accent, unlike others in the cast, although most of the accents sound more Spanish than anything else to my ear (as does some of the ethnic music). Even more amazing, it takes a while for anybody from the government, local or American, to show up for the spaceship's crew (at which point the locals are confused by the idea of visiting Venus rather than Venice, which makes me somewhat surprised the climatic battle is not in the city of canals).
Meanwhile, Pepe, a boy from the local fishing village who drams of earning 200 lire to buy a cowboy hat, discovers a strange egg, which he promptly sells to Dr. Leonardo (Frank Puglia). The small creature grows rapidly and eventually attains a heigh of 20 feet as it starts cutting a path of destruction through the streets of the Eternal City. Fortunately Colonel Caulder is around to offer helpful exposition (apparently the crew discovered you cannot breathe on Venus, but only after many of them stopped dropping dead), but the film comes down to Harryhausen's special effects with the Ymir and the pathos he creates for the creatures who is stranded on a planet millions and millions of miles from home (think King Kong with scales). This is mainly because every time the action focuses on the humans the dumb dialogue really starts to get to you. Still, it is nice to go back to those good old days when a couple of American military officers could throw around a bunch of lire and do what they want in a foreign country where everybody apparently understands English if they are not actually speaking the language. ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" is pure B-movie entertainment, owing all of its success entirely to Harryhausen's stop motion animation with the Ymir, because you will end up rolling your eyes at just about everything else in this 1957 film (unless, of course, you have yet to hit puberty and are inclined to giggle at the insipid romance between the astronaut and the almost doctor).
Finally, boys and girls, let us consider the scientific validity of the title.  Is Venus 20 million miles from earth?  Well, Venus is 67 million miles from the sun and the Earth is 93 million miles from the sun.  So that is a difference of 26 million miles, BUT that assumes the two planets are on the same side of the sun and on the same plane and all sorts of other fun things.  At any given moment the planets could be anywhere from 26 million to 160 million miles away from each other.  But would a title ""26 to 160 Million Miles From Earth"" really work?  I think not.",1032566400,5,3368,4.709677419354839

The story may be trite and the screenplay not particularly noteworthy, but the illusion of life given the Ymir, a reptilian biped creature brought unwillingly from Venus to earth as an egg, is truly astonishing, and sometimes grotesquely beautiful.  Even more amazingly, we respond to the Ymir as a living, breathing creature.  Just knowing it's not an actor in a monster suit nor a drawn cartoon adds immeasurably to the effect.  After it hatches, the small gestures as it rubs its eyes and reacts to light in the increasingly hostile earthly environment make it particularly endearing.  In fact, we are inclined to root for this alien beast as it fights to survive while traveling from a tiny Sicilian fishing village to Rome where, of course, it wreaks havoc as a now understandably angry behemoth with very destructive proclivities.  The black and white photography, no doubt a result of budget concerns, is especially dynamic and appropriately moody with scenes richly shadowed. This new  edition includes nice wide and full screen transfers as well as trailers and featurettes.
Ray Harryhausen's life was inexorably changed when, as a teen, he saw ""King Kong"" (1933) at Grauman's Chinese theater in Hollywood.  The life-like puppet animation of the great ape by Willis O'Brien so captured his fancy that Ray went home and immediately attempted to duplicate the effects, making dinosuar models and animating them -- at 24 moves for every second of finished film -- within his own detailed miniature sets and hand-painted backgrounds.
His early efforts were quite good and his parents encouraged Ray to continue with his hobby which, in fact, was becoming more of an obsession.  He even cut up one of his mother's fur coats to make a lifelike pelt for one of his creations -- and was not reprimanded.  In 1938, at a science fiction club, he met another teen named Ray -- Ray Bradbury -- who had similar interests.  They encouraged each other and became life-long friends.  Harryhausen went to art school near Los Angeles. The quality of his designs and miniatures greatly improved and soon he was invited by his idol, Willis O'Brien, to work on the stop-motion ape movie ""Mighty Joe Young.""
In the age of eye-popping, super photorealistic computer generated animation, there's still something uniquely enthralling about seeing the interaction of fantastical three dimensional creatures with human actors.  Maybe it's the hands-on-touch of these clay, fur and metal-armatured creations that gives them the illusion of life in a way that CGI can never achieve. Even the tiny flaws and mistakes -- like the uneven movement of fur and sometimes even the fleeting fingerprints of the animators -- add an element of emotional realism that is hard to describe in words alone.  The mind knows the puppet is not alive but the eye and heart appreciate the art to such a degree that one is filled with astonishment and affection at this hand-crafted art.  This is something much more than merely the willing suspension of disbelief that all the story-telling arts demand. And no man did it better than Ray Harryhausen.  He has referred to the craft as ""playing God by molding life from clay.""  And maybe that's the truer subtext of the metaphor to which we respond with such delight and wonder.
Columbia/Tristar also distributes on DVD Harryhausen's ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger,"" ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad,"" ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" the latter with the incredible fighting skeletons, perhaps Harryhausen's most widely praised sequence.",1026172800,9,3820,5.047694753577106
641607,3,6303398375,"A long time ago, in a land far, far away, a young wide-eyed boy attended the local Saturday movie matinee. Here he met Ymir, the towering, bellowing monster from Venus who crash-lands on Earth in ""20 Million Miles to Earth"". The young boy was me. A routine story-line and a tepid romance do little for 1957's ""20 Million Miles to Earth"", but the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen has rarely been equaled. Like the early film classics, the monster here is portrayed with compassion and respect. It is one of Harryhausen's most sympathetic creations. Early in the movie, police and villagers chase the monster, evoking the original ""Frankenstein"". In the finale, the wounded beast clings to the crumbling walls of Rome's Coliseum(shades of 1933's ""King Kong""). The references are not random. They're done with reverence. As a wide-eyed boy, Harryhausen first worked on 80% of the animation for ""Mighty Joe Young"" in 1949. At the end of his career, he was enlisted for Disney's charming remake of ""Mighty Joe Young"". This time he was an actor. He had come full cycle.  1957's ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" stars William Hopper(son of Hedda/father of Dennis) as Col. Calder, the astronaut assigned to tame the creature. Just a few years later, Hopper would become immortalized on TV's ""Perry Mason"". This handsome Columbia TriStar 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer is nearly pristine. The generous DVD has 2 trailers, a promo for Harryhausen's ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"", and a one-hour documentary from 1997: ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"". It sparkles with clips from every fantasy feature this Academy Award-winning animator has enhanced. It's astounding. ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" is not a classic. The story creaks here and there. But the special effects resonate back to hand-made, sympathetic creations considered far too expensive in today's world of rote CGI. More than anything, ""20 Million"" will appeal to young, wide-eyed little boys. No matter how old they are.",1025654400,8,1964,5.156739811912225
641608,3,6303398375,"If you love Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation monster movies, this one certainly won't disappoint.  One of the FX-Meister's all-time best beasties  -  the ""Ymir,"" as it is dubbed  -  is the star of the show.  Actually, he's pretty much the only star of the show, the rest of the cast being composed of dubbed Italian actors.
The Ymir starts his life as an adorable little lizard from Venus, who hatches with kittenish mews from the cutest little egg, and prances playfully around the coffee table.  But he has a helluva metabolism.  Before long, he's able to move the coffee table and half the living room set around all by himself, and then the living room  -  and the rest of the house  -  as well.  Culturally deprived, the Ymir never saw King Kong, and fails to realize that tangling with circus elephants in public and climbing coliseums never comes to a good end.
All in all, a memorable little special effects goodie.",1022457600,3,930,4.666666666666667
641609,3,6303398375,"There is something endearing about 1950's B&W sci-fi...perhaps they are the visual equivalent of ""comfort food"". ""20 Million Miles To Earth"" is one of those films. Famed FX-meister Ray Harryhausen's creature (hatched from an egg brought to Earth by returning astronauts) is truly one of the creepiest and most affecting ""stop motion"" creations in the genre (with physical similarities that cast more than a little suspicion on the ""creators"" of the monster in the ""Alien"" films). Much standard ""armed forces vs. the creature"" mayhem ensues (and we all know that there's only one crowd-pleasing reason a monster scales a high object toward the end of a sci-fi film...thank you Isaac Newton). The mostly Italian cast provides unintentional chuckles in a ""MST 3K"" fashion, but Harryhausen's magic saves the day. And besides, how many films can you name that feature a WWF-style throwdown between an elephant and a lizard-primate from Venus?",1020211200,5,937,5.253333333333333
641610,4,6303398375,"This is easily the best of Ray Harryhausen's earlier films, and although slight the story of a mission to Venus that accidentally returns a dangerous alien to earth serves the star of the film--Harryhausen's special effects--extremely well.  Harryhausen is able to wring all sort of emotion from his creation, and you very quickly begin to respond to the YMIR as you would to a living, breathing performer.
One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the sympathy it creates for its monster: like King Kong and the Frankenstein Monster, the YMIR never asked to be brought into this world, and although it must be destroyed for the safety of others you can't help but feel sorry for the creature, who clearly wishes that every one would just leave it the heck alone.  It's an amazing feat of Harryhausen's art, and a must have for any fan of stop-motion animation.",1008374400,3,870,4.754966887417218
641659,3,6303398375,"I have watched this movie many times and always I am amazed at the genius of Ray Harryhausen.  The way the little creature from venus rubs his eyes and moves is incredible, but his screams become more unnerving as time passes.  Somehow I tend to feel sorry for the alien creature and think to myself, ""welcome to planet earth"".  Keep in mind however that without the special effects created by Mr. Harryhausen the movie would be real bad based on the existing screenplay.",1003449600,2,471,4.650602409638554
641660,4,6303398375,"I really enjoyed 20,000,000 Million Miles to Earth...This movie is Harryhausen all the way...his effects so dominate the flm that the rest of the film seems like foundation for Harryhausen's inventiveness...there's an awesome effect at the start, too--the huge futuristic looking USA ship sinking into the water...Harryhausen can even make an elephant seem mythic and alien, as he does in the climactic fight btwn Ymir and this mammal...A pity Herrmann didn't score this one, but it's a treat just the same. Harryhausen's creatures are so absurdly touching that they make you hate the petty humans trying to annihilate them!",995414400,,624,5.313131313131313
641661,4,6303398375,"This is a very tight, well made movie.  It has a very cool spaceship, a monster, explosions and army guys.  Basically everything the little guy looks for, but the big problem here is that this one makes Mommy cry.  The monster isn't trying to hurt anyone.  It just wants to get along, but people just keep getting in the way.  In the end it has to be killed.",980812800,,358,4.205882352941177

It made such an impression, that after 43 years of not having seen the movie, I still remember key parts of the story.  Old as the movie is, it still has a nostalgic charm that is intensely interesting. It's a classic.",970012800,,331,4.15625
641663,5,6303398375,Truly a work of art.  The main character of the film is the 'Ymir' and he is onscreen for almost the entire movie!  I love the scene with the dog fight.  Harryhausen was an underappreciated genius of his time and brought  stop motion '20 million miles' from where that Kong guy was.  A very cool  movie nowhere near as cheesy as other 50's monster flicks.  And critics  regard 'THEM' as the monster classic?  They must have missed this one!,963532800,,440,4.468354430379747
641664,4,6303398375,"This film's special effects are probably the only one that matches up to King Kong's wonderful effects! Oh, mabey because the effects are done by the wonderful Ray Harryhousan, whose insperation for every film he did was  from ""King Kong"" (1933). The stop motion in here is great and  mixing the alien effects with the humans actors is nothing less than  perfect. The monster starts out the size of a small action figure when it  is revealed in a starship that crashed from Venus. It then grows to the  size of a human and kills cows, dogs, and a farmer as the police track it's  tail. Finally, it grows to the size of King Kong as it finds it's way out  of the farmland and makes his way down the streets of Rome. The best scene  in the film is when the monster attacks a traveling circus and has a  vicious battle with an elephant as they both fight down the city streets of  a roman city. The story leaves you wondering and pondering what will happen  next as the alien claws, bites, and steps on residents of the city. The  effects are nothing less than spectacular. The quality of the VHS is great  with it being in the SP mode and remastered from the original film. This is  a movie that I never get board with because every time you watch, you spot  something that you didn't notice before! It's much better than most of  those movies that were made in the 1950's.",960076800,3,1371,4.338582677165355
641665,4,6303398375,"Ray Harryhausen transforms a Grade B film into a magic experience by his special effects wizardry. The Venus creature, sometimes known as the ""Ymir,"" arrives on Earth via a returning manned spaceflight that  crashes off the coast of Italy. One of the things salvaged from the wreck  is the tubular shaped egg of a Venus life form.  The egg hatches a tiny,  two-legged reptilian creature that gradually grows to monstrous proportions  in Earth's alien atmosphere.  After the creature escapes its captors, it  rampages through the streets of Rome.  The creature at times seems  bewildered by its strange surroundings.  Its acts of violence and mayhem  could be seen as defensive rather than malicious.  Harryhausen's  transformation of the grotesque Ymir into a figure of pathos in a world it  doesn't understand avoids the maudlin and is eerily effective.  The night  segment in the farmer's barn, before Ymir grows gigantic, has ""an old  dark house"" quality of suspense that raises the hackles.  The howling  cry of the creature achieves a peculiar blend of an elephant's trumpet and  a primate's screech with a unique inflection all its own.  It is the stuff  of troubled dreams.  The flowing motion of the animation and the seamless  blending with the real world backgrounds helps the viewer suspend disbelief  and really enjoy the action.  The movie suffers from a weak script that  merely serves as a reason for the special effects.  Some corny dialogue and  bland acting detracts from the film.
Beware the Italian kid with a yen  for Texas.  Negative comments aside, this film is great sci-fi/fantasy fun.  A good ""creature feature"" of 40 years ago.  Recommended viewing.",959817600,2,1676,5.0664206642066425
641666,5,6303398375,"This Harryhausen classic is a must and should be a part of any monster movie genre collection. There are many human interest stories besides the memorable fight scenes. The love connection between the scientists'  daughter and the male lead, the Italian fishing village, the young boy who  wants to be like the American space travelers, and the Ymir who was  monster-napped and is just trying to protect himself. My personal favorite,  besides the elephant fight scene, is the clay figure of the farmer battling  the Ymir in the barn with the pitchfork.

If you are a monster fan or a  sci-fi/horror movie collector this is a must see and have movie either for  the first time or for your movie collection.
