3589610,5,B001FXG1WC,"I saw the episode about magnets on TV and wanted it for my HS physics class.  It explains so much and mixes the technical with the real world application for students. I got the whole set, and found that the battery episode was also excellent, and the one on corn is tremendous for showing the diversity of the product, and the genetics and evolution involved.  It will be a great resource for my biology class! And there's more - rats, underwear, whiskey, vacuums, and glue.  It's amazing what you don't know about ordinary things.",1247875200,,532,4.638297872340425
3589611,5,B001FXG1WC,"Provides an interesting summary of the evolution of balloon flight.  The first balloons were made of paper, with the sections held together by buttons.  Fliers carried long poles with a sponge on the end to dip into water and apply on the surface whenever fire appeared.

Tethered balloons were used in 1794 to attain an aerial perspective on the enemy.  During WWII the Japanese launched some 7,000 balloons towards the U.S. with the intent of causing forest-fire firestorms; only 255 made it, and none started fires.  Meteorologists in 1862 took a balloon above 20,000 feet and discovered the jet-stream.  Another pioneer took a balloon up to 50,000 feet in the 1930s to study cosmic rays.  The highest a manned balloon has gone is 123,500 feet, in 1966.  Plastic bags invented in the 1950s helped high-altitude balloon development.

Hot air balloons fueled by propane brought the cost of a flight down to $20, vs. $3,000 using a helium-filled balloon.  Several East Germans copied early hot-air design to escape Communism.

Balloon-flight succeeded in crossing the Atlantic in 1978.  The first around-the-world trip occurred in 1999, taking 20 days, costing $18 million, and averaging 60 mph.  The design was a large upper bulb of helium, with hot air heated by propane below.

The Albuquerque Balloon Fest now attracts 900 balloons and one million spectators.  It is the most photographed event in the world.",1228262400,,1412,5.078260869565217
3589612,1,B001FXG1WC,"I have never written a review before on any produst that I brought on amazon. But this video was so much garbage that I fely obligated to say something. First I love the history channel and therefore expected a lot from their video. However all it talked about was american cars and the evolution af indy cars and Nascar. There are rally cars, touring cars, endurance racing all different types of racing all over the world. In fact racing probably didn't even start first in the USA. I learned nothing new nor could I interest my young nephew in it. I also got the motorcycle video and it was just as bad. Advice to History channel.......there is another world out there!!!!!",1225411200,,676,4.595041322314049
3589613,2,B001FXG1WC,"There are a number of factual errors in the presentation, and a substantial amount of political posing.  Having been born on the Canal Zone and actively studied the subject over the years this is not the video to spend your money on.......",1146009600,,239,4.690476190476191

3589615,2,B001FXG1WC,"While the video was good as far as it went... It didn't go into nearly enough detail or expound on the true difficulty of building the canal.
If you want a better understanding of what really went on try the ""A man, A plan, A canal:Panama"" instead...",1000080000,,250,4.340425531914893
3589616,5,B001FXG1WC,It makes an excellent introduction to an organizational theory course. It exposes the seedy underbelly of the Industrial Era and details the dawning realization that people are not just cogs in a machine.,998870400,,204,5.212121212121212
3589617,3,B001FXG1WC,"This video is 50 minutes and 70% of it is devoted to the Toronto Skydome.  The information leading up to why there were domed stadiums is good.  The Astrodome section is too brief and the Metrodome and Silverdome aren't even mentioned.  If the Skydome and  history of retractable roofs for sporting event venues is of strong interest, you'll like this film. For me, it wasn't complete.",993427200,,385,4.787878787878788
3589618,5,B001FXG1WC,"I had to watch this film in school and it was great. The movie shows how engineering mistakes that seemed minor caused tragic events. Sooome events included are rocket explosions, submarine sinking due to different gas amounts on sides of the boat, an army gun given to US soldiers in World War II that back fired and killed people, and much more. This film is great whether you are interested in disasters, love science, or just think the events listed are of your type. This is a great film for a teacher  to show to children or to add to your home video library. Buy this and enjoy.
HAPPY VIEWING!",979171200,,600,4.454545454545454

3589620,5,B001FXG1WC,"This is a very instructional video with a lot of information regarding the Panama Canal.  It is quite interesting to know that the first idea of the Canal was in 1534; that in 1906 was the first time an American president left the country to make an inspection of the work done.
The video has a useful amount of information.  It is a must see!",970531200,,343,4.2615384615384615

8303058,1,B001FXG1WC,Only 8 episodes of Modern Marvels. Immediately sent it back as I could get literally get the same number of episodes for a tenth of the price. Very deceptive saying eight discs (each episode was one disc) because other products have four episodes on a disc. Wouldn't buy again.,1456617600,,277,4.673469387755102

8303064,5,B001FXG1WC,This is appropriate for any classroom 5th grade or older. It is interesting to see TR's role in the canal as well as the impact of the Great Depression on Americans who worked on the canal.  It also gives a realistic view of prejudice of the day.  I have created a viewing guide for this video that can be found at teacherspayteachers website.,1349308800,,343,4.428571428571429
8303065,4,B001FXG1WC,"It was a very informative and entertaining video. I teach 5th grade and while content is probably suitable for middle school, the short segment on ""Hell on Wheels"" was more than I wanted to expose them to. Just the title would set the silly pre-adolescents in a fit of giggles and the news that the railroad men spent their money on booze and at the brothels, would've been WAY more than I wanted to deal with throughout the day. I solved the issue by muting the sound and picture for that short time and asking them questions. They never had a clue I was censoring.",1337644800,,566,4.4
