8056961,5,B0009312VO,"Perhaps one of the most under-rated actors/producers/writers in French cinema, Artus de Penguern (currently starring in Agathe Christie) makes his directoral debut in an incredibly unique film as a shy office worker with zero interest in football.

Honestly, the film cannot be faulted for its story - simple, Amelie-esque (a shy, now adult, orphan comes to Paris for their first job, et cetera) ... in short, Amelie stripped of its dreamy quality, with a realistic though ironically goofy feel. The plot starts very simply, slowly becoming crazier, with references to classics in between (Chaplin, Madame Bovary...).  The film presents an untouched, indescribable quality not seen in the mainstream cinema today. Moulin and his creator are unknown, and rightly so, becoming a pleasant surprise once discovered. Certainly, as far as physical-humour films go, the best kept French secret.",1230854400,,887,5.467153284671533
8056962,4,B0009312VO,"Ignore the credits on this page - this definitely does NOT star Seann William Scott, although he is lined up for the proposed American remake. But it's hard to see how it could match this little-seen treasure. Starring, directed and co-written by Artus de Penguern, 'Gregoire Moulin' definitely deserves to be better known.

The plot is pretty much lifted from 'After Hours': a shy and spectacularly unlucky office worker finds himself locked out and goes through a night of hell trying to get the office keys so he can make a date with the ballet teacher he has admired from afar. Minor inconveniences lead to increasingly major disasters until he finds himself pursued across night time Paris by a psychotic taxi driver and his dog, a pair of swingers, a suicidal woman, Adolf Hitler, various cops, football hooligans, and other maniacs in a city in the life-or-death grip of the football cup final (in which many supporting characters appear as players in one subtle touch). As the game intensifies, Moulin's misadventures begin to mirror the play on the field to increasingly bizarre effect, while his beloved's reaction to the copy of 'Madame Bovary' she is trying to read in a bar packed with football fans has its own effect on the game.

Its humour is a mixture of Clouseau, Tati, Chaplin and others, albeit with a darker French spin, and it has moments of real comic genius and some outrageous sight gags that will have you reaching for the rewind button. Sadly, it goes awry in the last reel (and it's a bit disconcerting for non-French audiences to see a comedy end up with a higher body count than 'Straw Dogs'), but it's so much fun along the way, chances are you'll forgive it. It's directed with skill and subtlety, never hitting you over the head with its absurdity, content to place some sight gags in the background. It also has cinema's coolest ever fancy dress party and a couple of truly great moments of choreography - Penguern's brief fantasy ballet with the object of his affection manages to be very funny, incredibly sweet and also superbly danced, all with a completely straight face, while the fancy dress dance number in the end credits is great fun.

This Canadian DVD comes with French soundtrack and optional English subtitles, but no extras. The main titles are masked at 2.35:1 but the main feature is presented 1.85:1.",1119398400,6,2353,4.8049382716049385
