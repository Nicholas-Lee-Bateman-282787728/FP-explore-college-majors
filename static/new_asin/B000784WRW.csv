2204378,5,B000784WRW,"Howard Hughes: The Man & The Madness is the stranger-than-fiction true story of billionaire businessman, record- setting aviator, invention mogul, and recluse Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (1905-1976). Despite his stunning accomplishments, Hughes had no true friends or family; his obsessive-compulsive disorders and drug abuse worsened as he aged and cut himself off more and more from the outside world. This remarkable DVD biography includes special features such as newsreel footage of Hughes' notable accomplishments in the 1930's through 1950's, and is an astounding examination of a brilliant, driven, and tragic man. 98 minutes, color and black-and-white.",1126310400,15,659,5.875

2204400,5,B000784WRW,"I saw this movie last night and I was suprised at how much this video covers. It talks about the reason he became the way he was.at the end of his life. I know that in the movie they blamed his mother for the way he become: germophobic, obsessive compulsive and other things but we cannot forget all the great things he accomplished in his life;founding the company TWA, the flight around the world which was faster than the one Charles Lindberg did, starting a foundation for research in health, the hospital bed that are still used in the hospitals nowadays, etc. I agree that it is sad the way he ended his life but I resent the comment made before me that the way he ended his life was a comic relief for him and his friend. It is not, it is sad to see a man that had everything and to see him destroy his life the wayhe did. I agree with Mr. Bob Maheu that at the end of his life the people that were supposed to take care of him were only using him to fill their bank accounts. I wish that somebody who knew him and who cared about him could have been there to help him and get him from that hell he was living in but he had nobody in his life that had could have done that..",1410825600,5,1181,4.029787234042553

2204402,5,B000784WRW,"It is amazing to watch this man's absolute genius decompose into total paranoia and hypochondria.  For one who had the world at his fingertips, to become an almost psychotic recluse is indicative of the level humanity any of us are capable of falling to.

2204404,1,B000784WRW,"Interesting video for the uninitiated, but otherwise not worse the money. Get a book about the life of HH, it will give you more insights than this relative superfical video. I bought it by accident, as I thought it is a book. :-(",1264896000,4,230,4.372093023255814

2204406,1,B000784WRW,"Okay, would I spend $9 for a new or used copy of this? Certainly not. This documentary is pretty cheezy and maudlin--the ""menacing"" sounding synth music tries to create an 'effect' but it eventually just gets really funny.

 Positive thing is this documentary is supplying my friend and I with plenty of comic fodder as we continue to riff on this--the part where he is holed up in the Bevery Hills bungalow is where it starts to get amusingly bad.",1231286400,6,448,4.5875
2204407,5,B000784WRW,"""Howard Hughes The Man and The Madness"" delivered a comprehensive view into the exciting life of Howard Hughes. I found the movie to cover all the major parts of Howard's life from birth to death but did not go extensively into the technical aspects of Hughes' business empire. Mostly the bio focused on his personal life in Hollywood and a general overview of his different ventures. however a solid buy for the money.",1229040000,7,419,4.7534246575342465
2204408,4,B000784WRW,"If you enjoy learning about greatness - often coupled with quirky-ness and a dash of insanity, then enjoy this documentary.  It is interesting to see the man in his prime, as he is slipping, and ending with a sad chronicle of his last decade or so.  I wound up proud of him, pittying him, and entertained as to satisfying several curiousities.
