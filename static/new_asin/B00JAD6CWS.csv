8649379,1,B00JAD6CWS,"No closed caption and no subtitle! Don't buy DVD without subtitles. We are living in the era of disabilities discrimination during the Obama presidency. Liberal Democrats dislike disabilities, especially for powerless hearing impaired because they feel that we are weak, poor and brainless illiterate. We are deeply grateful to Republicans for establishing American Disability Act 1990 for giving our opportunities and advancements to all American disabilities which Democrats denied and ignored our disabilities plights and rights.",1471046400,3,532,6.0131578947368425
