I am so very excited about this new movie and hope it stays true to the orignal but then I have never known Johnny Depp do any part of any movie that was not just EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!",1324771200,9,386,4.133333333333334

4973871,1,B00683T5CW,"Just got reminded of this movie recently. My entire family were so excited to see it, since we all love the original series. It's one thing to take a new twist on a classic, it's another to just make characters opposites of what they are in the show in a stupid, uninspired and sophomoric way. I like the actors in the movie, but it was just inane, and insulting.",1512000000,,363,4.27536231884058

4973907,1,B00683T5CW,"I love Dark Shadows (the original soap opera), and I love Johnny Depp.  That being said, I spent years hoping for a Dark Shadows movie that would do justice to the little series that overcame near cancellation in its first year to be cultural icon of its age with over 1125 episodes.  I hoped and I prayed that they would recapture the odd, insular world of the ""old money"" family of Collinses, as well as the forlorn melancholy of Barnabas Collins; a man turned vampire whose undying love for his bride-to-have-been, Josette DuPres, carries him ever forward in the storyline, possessed by the idea that somehow, someway, he will one day be reunited with her.  During his imprisonment in a coffin in 1876 by his own father, he had nothing but years of time to think about his lovely Josette throwing herself off the cliffs of Widows Peak because she could not bear the possibility that she too would be cursed with vampirism if she allowed her love for Barnabas to win over her caution.  Spending 175 years trapped within his own regrets, Barnabas is driven by both his past, his regrets, and his vampirism as he moves among the unsuspecting Collinses of the 1970's.

Sure, it was a soap opera, and sure, production values were strained to the limit, but the original series earned its following of millions of fans, and a great many of those are still around today who remember ""running home after school"" to catch each episode.  I  certainly do, and I certainly did.

So what happened to this movie?  Instead of a film that respected the fans and our long history with the series and  characters, we were asked to swallow a cringy, embarassing comedic fail that was so bad that my predictions of it's failure came true in spades.  The minute I found out that it was supposed to be ""funny"", I knew it was going to be awful.  It was, too.  Sophomoric jokes, stupid, insulting sight gags' a weak and ghastly waste of money if you paid to see it, and that's so very sad.  It could have been so much better, but better wasn't what Tim Burton was shooting for.  He wanted a camp, laughable send-up and it had predictable results.  By way of example, what modern parody of a classic TV series has had anything approaching success?

Before you jump up and hold your arm up in class begging to be called on, Addams Family movies don't count.  Those weren't parodies.  They were brilliant because they RECAPTURED what made the original series popular.  The cast and crew just expanded on it and widened the whole creepy/cool Addams universe.

The ones that circled the drain and gurgled on down were such mediocre offerings as ""The Beverley Hillbillies"" remake. the regrettable ""Mod Squad"" that tried to be serious, ""CHIPS""; one they never should have contemplated redoing, ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" (live action version).  That was a movie so bad that Dr. Seuss's widow laid down the law and forbade any more live action versions of Dr. Suess classics from ever being made again.  Now that's bad!  And who can forget the early kid's SF series, ""My Favorite Martian""?  I can,  Believe me, I'm much better off having it purged from conscious thought.

End comment?  Don't bother with trite remakes or ""retreatments"".  They usually suck eggs, and you will only spend money, not see a film worth remembering.  Why not rent the original series instead, and enjoy the dark pathos of Barnabas Collins while counting the number of times a set wobbled or a microphone boom drops into the shot?  Give yourself extra points if you spot the moment an entire studio video camera rolls into the scene, or when Julia Hoffman has to display fear at half door that doesn't conceal the fog making machine.  There are so many gaffs and bloopers that the actors had to get past, that you really have to hand it to them for sticking to the script.  Like that one time Barnabas was explaining his love for Josette, when off-screen there is the sound of a stage light breaking, then the sounds of someone putting out the fire with a fire extinguisher, all while Jonathan Frid gets through his lines while his eyes are looking all around for signs that it was time to flee the building.

Now, honestly, what could be funnier than the original?",1510790400,,4219,4.6567567567567565

She called my aunt and told her and said they were going to have to have a marathon together and mom didn't care if it meant she had to take a personal day (not something she'd normally do).

4974066,4,B00683T5CW,"While I'm a big fan of the original gothic soap opera from the late 60's-70's, this Tim Burton film is more of a spoof on the source material than a standard reboot. In some ways it works but personally, if you were a fan of the original show you might appreciate the humor a lot more than someone who's never heard of Dark Shadows. I'll give it to Johnie Depp for his perfect ten impersonation of Jonathan Fridd's Barnabas Collins being the highlight of this movie. This film is quite funny & has that certain dark humor aspect that's a trademark in most of Burton's filmography. This version of Dark Shadows takes many liberties with the original show not unlike the 90's NBC reboot. The Julia vampire cure story arc is visited here briefly but is essentially unfinished for what was supposed to be a hopeful sequel. The rest of the cast are decent yet Michelle Pfeiffer & Eva Green are particularly wonderful here. While I certainly don't hate this movie like most hardcore DS fans, I can appreciate it's humor & that the story takes place in the mid 70's instead of relying it to take place in the present. Regardless what most critics think, this is a fun film. I still have high hopes for a proper Dark Shadows reboot ala Netflix or AMC in the vein of Showtime's Penny Dreadful or Salem from WGN.",1490400000,,1302,4.4978902953586495

I finally watched it, trying my best to view it more as a Tim Burton movie, and less as a spin off of a classic TV soap opera.  With that in mind I quite liked it.  I also feel like this appeals more to fans of The Munsters or Addams Family, and I love both. I think there's actually a lot of similarity in tone between this and the Addams Family Movie.  The visuals are among Burton's finest.  The casting is good.  I'm also a huge fan of Danny Elfman, and his score for this is great.  A good movie for Tim Burton fans, but maybe not fo diehard Dark Shadows fans.",1486684800,,681,4.0

4974181,1,B00683T5CW,"I was one of those in the large population of fans who ran home from school to watch the original series every day. I tried to never miss one. I purchased the 200 tape VHS editions, then the DVD versions and now own the coffin-designed set, and have seen all 1200 (or so) episodes, watching the entire show through 6 times now since the VHS tapes were released.

When I heard that Tim Burton was to film a version of Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp, I was more than excited. I knew that both of them were huge fans of the original series. I thought this was going to be a real treat for Dark Shadows fans.

Forward about a year later after the first announcement of the film. I walked into the theater on opening day, the first showing, terribly excited. I sat with anticipation through the trailers and then the film started. It opened with a wonderful 10 minute sequence of the Collins family coming to America, I couldn't believe how great it was and knew that they had hit the mark. But after the opening sequence, from the minute Nights in White Satin started to play, the film took a turn for the worse, and I really mean worse. It went from a 10 to a 1 (or zero) in minutes. I was never so disappointed. I had seen behind the scenes film of the cast and crew watching the original series on set while make-up was applied, and again, knowing how Depp and Burton loved this show, was just stunned at what they turned this into.

Why did Depp have to have a white face yet AGAIN! Jonathan Frid never did. Julia used to love Barnabas, so they made her a woman using him to give herself a longer life. Carolyn a werewolf? Anqelique owning a business in Collinsport? Barnabas and Angelique making love by banging each other against walls and items in a room? No one had any character depth. Add insult to injury, to have Collinwood burn down? That was a real smart move to please the fans (NOT). How about Roger turning his back on a loved one? Never would have happened under any circumstances in the original series, Roger defended the family to the last man.

And the worst insult of all, the original 4 cast members who received only a total of about 30 seconds of screen time, if that. Jonathan Frid was very old when this was done and not well. I have read a book describing the original cast's involvement in this. Frid had to be escorted by the great Jim Pearson (who is keeping the original series alive with years conventions and more) to England because he was frail. The 4 cast members did not know what they were going to be doing, they prepared for a good scene. It turns out all Burton offered them was a camera shot of them walking in the front door to a party at Collinwood and a few seconds of a 2nd shot of them at the party. This to me was a terrible insult. It was not long after Frid returned to Canada that he passed away, in fact it was so close to his coming home I have no doubts that part of his death had to do with him making this trip and how hard it was on him. Then to find out that was all he was to do. He must have been crushed.

This movie is a joke. Maybe people will like it who have never seen the original series, but I am afraid that this film has ruined the possibility of a real Dark Shadows movie to ever be made. Had Tim Burton taken the road he did with Sleepy Hollow, and made this a horror film, like Dan Curtis's film ""House of Dark Shadows"" did, this might have been something incredible.

If you like awful stupid humor, poorly directed actors, awful storylines, a witch and vampire fighting over a fishing business, Johnny Depp yet again with a white face, and not taking seriously the very reason Dark Shadows was a phenomenon, then this movie is for you. If you were and are a true fan of the original series, watch the first 10 minutes because it is done beautifully and had they continued like that, this could have been an awesome film, and then take your discs out of the original series. I find it totally shocking how 2 people could be such huge fans of the original series and do what they did for this movie. They had the talent to produce a first class Dark Shadows movie that could have ended up as one of the best horror movies of the year, or decade or all time. Instead we get a spoof, a bad one at that. Dark Shadows, the original series, had it's funny moments because the cast played it straight, they didn't spoof horror. That was one of the biggest mistakes of this film.

To Tim Burton and Johnny Depp: Why oh why didn't you take this movie seriously? How could you do this to something you both absolutely loved? I am very disappointed.",1484092800,2,4609,4.266590389016018

The rawness of the acting even if they flub their lines and it's still left on the show.  This DVD collection is a nice set.  It doesn't say who technically hand picked these episodes to be on this set.  ""Fans"" is a generic term.  If you've never seen ""Dark Shadows"", then it's hard to say if you'd like this set.  The reason being there is no continuity.  You'll watch one episode and want to find out what happens next, but you won't be able to as those episodes won't be here.  This set isn't remastered and it doesn't have closed captioning.  Still this give the newcomer a pretty good idea of the tone of this show.",1482883200,5,851,4.322784810126582

4974442,2,B00683T5CW,"I'll be charitable and say Fair. Johnny Depp is a talented comedic actor and always good for at least a few laughs, and often many. Still, I would have given this only one star if not for the action scenes at the end which were quite good. But it's surprising, at least to me, that a Tim Burton-Johnny Depp collaboration could be so mediocre. And this despite the presence of my favorite actress Michelle Pfeiffer. The presence of the talented Chloe Grace Moretz, who was quite good in ""The Equalizer"", seems mostly wasted. Not even Burton's wife, the always interesting Helena Bonham Carter, can save this.

********************************************************************Spoiler Alert******************************************************************************************
My main problem is the attempt to mix (too much) horror with comedy. At least twice, Depp's character brutally murders a group of people. No, it's not ""R""-level violence, but there's blood and one hears that Depp's vampire character has basically ripped their throats out. He does this to a group of hippies he was amiably chatting with in the mountains. I know they call this dark comedy, but it's too dark to afterwards laugh at very many of the jokes Depp's character is involved with. And a lot of the jokes are just duds.

 How do you make a comedy based on a soap opera about a vampire?  Hire Tim Burton to direct and Johnny Depp to star.  This said, I generally don't care much for Burton.  I find him too dark to be very funny but this time he hit the mark.  I do love Depp however and this is much more enjoyable than either his recent The Tourist or The Rum Diary.  Depp gets to play a tragic victim of a vampire curse who spends the 19th and 20th centuries undead but sealed in a casket.  He and writers John August (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burtons Corpse and a dozen other scripts) and Seth Grahame-Smith (a first timer at movie writing) make full use of the opportunity to make out-of-time jokes, vampire jokes and jokes about miss-directed romance.
 The rest of the cast are famous and famously good actors, which they continue to be in this well acted film.
Eva Green plays the most beautiful witch since Nicole Kidman in Practical Magic.  Greens witch is hopelessly in love with Depp and everyone knows that there is nothing as terrible as a witch scorned.  Michelle Pfeiffer is the practical matriarch of the Collins family, smoothly transitioning in her career from leading lady to supporting actress.  Helena Bonham Carter has another role where she is allowed to vividly portray her character, in this case an amoral, alcoholic psychiatrist.  Carter always looks like she is having the time of her life on screen.  Jackie Earle Haley rounds out the famous or near famous in the cast as the family retainer, another alcoholic and another good effort.
 Depp and the other producers spent a reputed $150 million to make this film.  The special effects are truly special.  There is a ghost that is about as good a ghost as has ever been put on celluloid.  Another great effect happens late in the film and involves Eve Green.  I won't give it away but watch for it, I think you will admire it as I did.  The sets and costumes are also of the very highest quality, the eye equivalent of Godiva Chocolates.
 Special effects cannot carry a film.  Good acting cannot carry a film alone.  Even good writing cannot carry a film absent other necessary ingredients.  Films are stories told visually.  For a story to hold our attention, the leading character must be someone we can like.  The challenge for Burton, Depp and the writers was to make Barnabas Collins, the vampire, into someone we like, someone we can identify with.  But in order to like Barnabas we have to ignore the fact that he is a blood sucking vampire.  We have to ignore the fact that he is a mass and serial murderer.  In the end, I just couldn't do it.  But I still liked the movie for the grand professionalism of everyone involved, from the nearly always entertaining Depp to the music provided by veteran music man Danny Elfman.  Movies often seem to be real in a way that live theater does not.  In live theater we can enjoy the actors without being transported to another place.  Dark Shadows is like that.  I enjoyed this three saw blade movie without being transported to somewhere else.
 The PG-13 (mass murder, one tongue in cheek sex scene) movie runs one hour and 53 minutes.  It has grossed $65 million worldwide in three days and has a shot at returning the staggering $150 million the producers lavished on this lavish production.  Best of luck, guys, I hope you get your money back.",1470355200,,3379,4.582637729549249

is not always lost. Procrastination saved me from buying these individually, and this past week I grabbed this 50th Anniversary DVD set locally for about two bucks more than that listed ($12.69) here. As they say in one of the promos; I was literally that young teen scrambling home after school, before my parents arrived from work, to get an early evening scare. And since this show aired before supper it gave the fright ample hours to evaporate before bedtime.

You get 6discs in a clear plastic DVD keepcase, which has two inside hinged pages. It contains two movies and four collections totaling 37 proper episodes (& 2 duplicates). Both compilation films are in color while the early TV episodes are in black & white, later ones are color. (I haven't watched these through so I cannot confirm when the change takes place, though the Dark Shadows wiki states that episode #295 (08/11/1967) was the first episode of the original series taped in color.)

Understand upfront that the audio/visual has not been remastered, but its still pretty good, and if you grew up watching these then you probably survived a time before high definition & wraparoundsound. Each film has special features, and each separate collection has Promos, as well as the option of playing each individual episode with or without an introduction. Below is a breakdown of the content as provided in the DVD menus;

> Disc One: The Vampire Curse / Color / 210 Minutes

Note: The Dark Shadows wiki states that this is a DVD compilation of episodes 370 to 460 & 210212, key scenes from which have been edited together to form a three hour feature. It focuses on the love triangle between Barnabas Collins, Josette DuPres & Angelique Bouchard

Special Features:
* Bonus Episode #221
* Interview with Jonathan Frid
* Kathryn Leigh Scott PBS Promo

> Disc Two: Fan Favorites Episodes; #212, 365, 370, 699, 725, 1024, 1065, 1102 & 1115

> Disc Three: The Haunting of Collinwood / Color / 190 Minutes

Note: The Dark Shadows wiki states that this is a DVD compilation of episodes 639 to 694, key scenes from which have been edited together to form a three hour feature. It focuses on Quentin Collins' possession of David Collins & Amy Jennings.

Special Features:
* Bonus Episode #836
* Interview with David Selby

4974677,5,B00683T5CW,"Happy 50th Anniversary to Dark Shadows! It premiered on June 27th, 1966. Without Tim Burton's film, I probably never would've seen this show. When I see a movie I love and it's based on a tv series, I engorge myself in the series. I also did this with Get Smart, The Dukes of Hazzard, The A-Team, Land of the Lost, and 21 Jump Street. I started out buying the individual collections, but after buying 13 of them, I realized it was cheaper to buy the $350 Coffin Set with all 1,225 episodes. I came into some money at the time and really wanted it, so I finally got it. It's a very frustrating and entertaining series. It's a soap opera, but it's filled with gothic imagery, ghosts, murder, a Phoenix, graveyards, vampires, time travel, demons, witches, a Leviathan cult, werewolves, warlocks, zombies, a Frankenstein type monster, parallel time and much more. It took 210 episodes til Barnabas Collins, the famous vampire of the show to be introduced. It took me 11 months to watch all 1,225 episodes.

Anyway, this 50th Anniversary set is a 6-disc collection of the individual releases over the last few year. It has The Best of Barnabas (which was actually the first one I bought to get ready for the Tim Burton movie. Episode 221 has become one of my favorites because it's the first episode I ever saw) The Vampire Curse is a 3 hour cut of the 1795 storyline. The Haunting of Collinwood focuses on Quentin's ghost. Fan Favorites, The Best of Angelique and The Best of Quentin. I already have the Coffin box set, so there's no need for me to buy this. If you're just starting out and wanna dip your toes in the Dark Shadows pool, then you might enjoy the DARK SHADOWS 50TH ANNIVERSARY COMPILATION!!!",1466985600,12,1702,4.580327868852459

4974748,5,B00683T5CW,"I explain the details below in the comments section.  I will just say here that these are 6 discs previously released by MPI after they released all the episodes in 32 sets of 4 discs plus 3 special standalone discs (all off which would be reissued together in a coffin shaped mega set, and their previous versions in 2012).  These discs are 2 summary discs released in 2009 (The Vampire Curse and The Haunting of Collinwood) and the 4 Best of discs (Best of Barnabas and Fan Favorites released in 2012, Best of Angelique and Best of Quentin both released in 2015).  They are good discs for a newbie to get started on the series, but once you buy the full series they will be duplications (albeit the episodes on the 4 Best Of discs have special newly recorded intros to them recorded on them by the stars: Fan Favorites by Kathryn Leigh Scott, Quentin (actually ""Quentins"" since he played 4 different Quentins) by David Selby, and both Angelique and Barnabas by Lara Parker (Jonathan Frid died just before MPI started manufacturing the latter). If you want an inexpensive way to start your interest in the series, by all means buy, but be prepared to give it in whole or in part as a stocking stuffer if you buy the whole series later (the 6 individual releases MAY still be available).  By the way for those who are detail oriented, do not confuse the ""Best of Barnabas"" disc in this collection with the featurette of the same name on Episode Collection (or as I call it Red Set for the original 2006 release cover art, the reissue is a standard box)  26 disc 3 or Disc 127 or 128 of the coffin set.  The disc in this set (or its separate release from 2012) of that name is 9 episodes hosted as I said by Lara Parker, whereas the featurette is an hour or less compilation of Jonathan Frid clips from throughout the series entire run.  Why they chose to name the newer disc with the same name, I do not know.",1463270400,101,1909,4.40625

4974750,4,B00683T5CW,"Given it's less than stellar reputation I was surprised and pleased to find that, while this was not up to the greatest of Burton/Depp collaborations like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, it's still enjoyable, fun, witty and playful stuff.

Depp, as always is terrific, making Barnabas Collins a figure of fun, but also finding some real pathos beneath the camp in this tale of a courtly, gentlemanly, love-sick vampire set free after 200 years buried underground.,  While this remake of the 70s supernatural soap opera is intentionally kitschy, and light on story, the characters, dialogue, use of music, and supporting performances are all very enjoyable.  In making fun of the 1970s from which it sprang, Burton and Depp never lose their sense of affection for what they're making fun of -- and thats long been their strong suit. (Think of Ed Wood, a film about arguably the worst film-maker of all tine, and how kindly and empathetic it was underneath all the kidding).

This got mixed reviews, and probably being being under hyped helps when you see it.  This is not a great film.  But it is a goofily endearing one, and Depp adds another wonder to his ever growing list of unforgettable characters.",1463011200,6,1204,4.877450980392157

4975056,3,B00683T5CW,"I had no idea this was going to be an a shallow send-up of the original TV series, but I would have been okay with that... if this had been a good film. Unfortunately, its deeply self-indulgent and not quite campy enough (or ridiculous enough) to be hilariously funny.

Unlike the TV series, there's no attempt to make this believable. Depp's makeup and styling are so preposterous, there is no way anyone would take him seriously. So, yes, it's a parody.

The problem is, most of the performances lack commitment and the fun I expect from a good parody. If Depp had brought even half the whimsy and flair of his Jack Sparrow performance -- not the drinking, slurred speech, and so on, but the added style and energy this part deserved -- he could have saved this film, all by himself.

Helena Bonham Carter's performance did have some sparkle, but -- with far less screen time -- even her talents seemed subdued. (That's saying a lot, if you're familiar with her work. She has an innate gift for taking roles to an extreme, with so much authenticity, even the silliest characters become fascinating and vibrant.)

To be perfectly honest, this movie is awful if you're watching it for entertainment. Especially while sober.

However, as a reference for traditional Gothic storytelling, this film excels. The character profiles, sets, and story elements -- while often overdone -- hit the key points expected by fans of Gothic romantic mysteries.

If you're an aspiring traditional Gothic novelist, buy the DVD. Watch the film and take notes. Also, the brief list of iconic characters -- and too-short insights in related interviews -- make it worth the low price (and time) you'll spend on this.",1447718400,,1695,4.827586206896552

4975155,3,B00683T5CW,"TIM BURTON  JOHNNY DEPP  DARK SHADOWS  2012

No matter how spectacular this film is and its special effects are, the film itself is a remake of at least half a dozen story lines already famous and vastly imitated on all screens. Anne Rice brought the vampires out of their closet with Lestat de Lioncourt from Auvergne, France, and that has brought to life a myriad if not a host of vampires of all types, genres and sexes (definitely more than two). Then she dared make her vampires meet with her witches, the Mayfair family from Montpellier, France, and even beyond, and that brought some new episodes of great power and that has so far not been exploited in the cinema or on television, at least at that level. And in 2012 she started a new series with werewolves, mind you, Reuben Golding and many more. But in the meantime the BBC produced a phenomenal series with vampires, werewolves and ghosts living in the same house and trying to pass for humans, Being Human shot in Bristol, GB, 2008-2013, immediately remade in Montreal. So there is really nothing new under the sun, really nothing.

Then the family curse is so trite and banal it does not bring anything new. And the dear cursed vampire will win in the end. Banal since we knew it from the start and he will win by the destruction of his main enemy and releasing a werewolf in the world, and anyway he does not really win since he is helped by a ghost and a child. Brilliant and pathetic.

The spectacular special effects do not retrieve this film that has no real plot nor density. A film for people who just want things close to maybe after all we could say some creative inspiration without being too creative because I don't want to have a headache. This time Mr. Tim Burton is making money more than a film that will last beyond the summer matinees for young teenagers, well not too young though because it might be restricted.

His family arrived in America many years ago, and built a fine fishing business calling the town -'Collinsport' along with a splendid mansion.
'Barnabas' who finishes an affair with one of the house servants has picked the wrong lady to mess with.............she's a 'witch'
she places a curse on the 'Collins' family killing the parents and condemning 'Barnabas' with a life as a 'vampire'
Unable to win him back she has him buried in a coffin secured by chains......................'196' years later a group of workmen uncover the coffin and cut the chains, 'Barnabas' is freed.
It's a strange world, '1972' so much has changed, he returns to the family home to find it run down, however the home is still occupied by the 'Collins' descendants, who are some what dysfunctional.
'Barnabas' discovers the business is now run by .............and yes,'the witch 'Angelique' (Eva Green) that had condemned him nearly 200 years ago................well 'mayhem' is about to break out as 'Barnabas' sets out to re-build that which the family had lost.
'Angelique' has other ideas.

4975227,4,B00683T5CW,"This was a solidly good movie! At the end of the day, I think I give it 3.5 stars, but amazon only lets you vote in whole stars. Eva Green gives the best performance of the movie, although Johnny Depp is close behind. The greatest strength of this movie has to be the dynamic plot that keeps moving along. However, that same plot does kind of lack a central climax, or most exciting point. The movie sort of has 4-5 medium range high points, and you think ""Well, there was the climax!"" but in reality the movie keeps going, tying up several loose ended plot lines. That is less than perfect, but honestly, I'd rather see that situation than a movie that just appears to have no point at all, and underwhelms. The plot also develops quickly and doesn't languish on any uninteresting developments.

At the end of the day, this is a pretty fun and exciting movie, and Johnny Depp's gothic look and tone are pretty much right on the mark. Like I said, though, the strongest acting job was by Eva Green, as the lead villain Angelique. There are probably two scenes in there that are genuinely funny, with the hippies and Alice Cooper, but I don't want to spoil anything. I would actually definitely recommend this movie.

4975258,2,B00683T5CW,"In my opinion, Tim Burton's DARK SHADOWS movie is a failure. Instead of doing a quirky ""hip"" reinterpretation of the material, he should have attempted to recapture the spirit of the show ,capitalizing on what made it popular in the first place. I realize that the original DARK SHADOWS is a semi-obscure TV serial that was on many years ago but like STAR TREK ,MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE, SUPERMAN and BATMAN,etc. it has a sizable fan base which expected a little respect for the characters and situations of the drama.  Instead, the filmmakers completely changed the tone of the original  turning it into virtually a Mad magazine parody of itself . This was not the best approach. Dan Curtis's DARK SHADOWS took many well established elements of supernatural horror  (vampires,werewolves, ghosts, etc.) and sci-fantasy (Frankenstein, Lovecraftian beings, time travel) and put them in a contemporary (1966-1971) setting. (That reminds me, since DARK SHADOWS was produced primarily in the 1960's, why the big tribute to the 1970's?  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.) What Burton and screenwriter  Seth Grahame-Smith  should have done was a serious storyline set in the modern (2012) world where, for example, someone is writing a book on the mysterious Collins family and then learning more than he ever wanted to know as its horrific secrets start unfolding. It's possible that Barnabas (the same 18th century Barnabas) could have been the current head of the family. The rest of the cast would be a combination of old and new characters. (You could have used some of the original actors if they wanted to participate, and if appropriate.) Popular horror motifs (like zombies, for instance) could have been used in the story and any traditional horror plot that was unused in the old show. (If any are left!) (No need to remake  the same Barnabas/Josette/Victoria Winters love story). The original fan base would have loved it and I suspect the rest of the audience would have found this fascinating and enjoyable. I suggest that someone try it again (like they did with PLANET OF THE APES)  and you could have a well received entertaining film .(My last beef with the 2012 film: You had both (now late) actors Jonathan Frid and Christopher Lee in the same film and they never appear together! That's unforgivable for old-time horror fans!)

4975351,5,B00683T5CW,"Fun movie. Not quite at the level of some of Burton's earlier works, but definitely uses some of the same great elements that he became so famous for. I see some older reviews are complaining that Johnny looks awkward as Barnabas, but my argument is... Isn't that the point with more Burton-Depp characters? Many of Burton's characters are most sellable on their awkwardness and I think that that is amazing. Many movies I've seen with awkward characters just can't sell them, so I see it as a great feat when Johnny and Tim can do it. I know that the original Barnabas was not so awkward and that this is based on the TV series of the same name, but when watching this you really have to try to disconnect it from what you already know as Dark Shadows. On it's own, it has great ability to make you laugh, feel creeped out and at times cry. The ""scares"" work well for people who's most feared horror movies are ones focused on religion or vampires and the comedy... Oh good lord, the comedy. I am not sure it's easy to describe without going on about how brilliant some of Johnny's remarks were. ""My dear, they tried to stone me. It did not work."" and ""That is the ugliest woman I have ever seen."" are some of the best ""joke"" punchlines in the film. The film also showed how well Johnny and Chloe can work together, too. Especially with dark comedy.

Also is a great treat for 70's music fans... Particularly Elton John fans who have their ears open in one of the bar scenes. I almost couldn't help singing along with ""Crocodile Rock"" in the theater myself. Was one of my favorite songs on my mother's Elton John CD set.",1429920000,,1621,4.403333333333333

70's music soundtrack with Alice Cooper making an appearance and doing 2 or 3 songs. Alice looks like he hasn't aged since the 70's. I don't know how much entertainment value Alice Cooper provides for anyone younger than 50.

Alice Cooper was great and seeing 4 of original series actors for a few seconds was great but too short.  The Angelique character was the worst part of the whole movie to me. Changing the whole idea also was it's biggest failing.

Collins supposedly hates being a vampire and a killer, but then turns his love interest into a vampire so they can live together forever -- ???  He can't stand the witch who turned him into a vampire, but then says he can't resist her sexually just so the film can include a sex romp (which has no relation to the story line) between two people with super powers -- ???

4975504,5,B00683T5CW,"This is an entertaining halloween movie. I actually liked it so much I bought it twice as I couldn't find my original copy after a move. The film is not meant to be taken to seriously as it's a dark comedy. Jonny Depp plays a vampire very similarly to how he plays a pirate, or a writer, or a chocolate maker, or a hat maker, but still adds whimsy of an otherwise dark subject (you know, the whole blood drinking aspect). This has been added to my halloween movie collection, which is saying something as one of the others is Hocus Pocus.

***SPOILER AHEAD***

The story itself is well thought out and leaves one wanting more as you end the movie on a cliff hanger. Unfortunately the cliff hangar was more for the imagination of viewers and not necessarily a sign of a sequel. That being said, if another Dark Shadows came out I would go see it. In the end, several of the family members reveal special talents, and one a curse, that would be interesting to see played out in a second movie.

4975555,4,B00683T5CW,"This is bad in the best possible ways.

The ""plot"" is almost a non-consideration, the real fun comes from the love of the film's embracing B-movie tropes, the tribute to the  cheesiness of original series which it was based on, and the full-on hammy performances of the cast members, who all seem to be genuinely enjoying their roles. It takes a special kind of movie for nearly ever character to be able to chew up the scenery, and yet not seem overly dramatic or self-important. This contributes to a lot of the film's humor, which often gets spiked into the narrative unexpectedly, like a dash of sugar someone suddenly decided to throw in your eyes and then they ran away before you could retaliate: sweet, funny, painful, and a little mystifying all at once.

Depp's character's makeup makes him seem disconcertingly young, like a member of Hanson from 10 years ago. It's a little weird, and not weird in the way the movie wants to be weird. His foundation makeup must be at least 1/8th of an inch thick.

Still, it works for the purposes Tim Burton wanted it to, and we don't exactly watch Tim Burton films for their driving socio-political commentary. We watch them because they're strange and wonderful and beautiful and just the right amount of twisted.",1416873600,,1262,4.722727272727273

It is a loving homage to the fans of the original, with all the daytime drama and cheese that I remember. Plot lines were necessarily streamlined to fit a movie time slot.

4975651,2,B00683T5CW,"All big fan of Johny Depp and Tim Burton as I am, I was still VERY disappointed by this film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film, as probably everybody knows, is the remake of an old TV show (1966-71) about a very strange family living in modern times in Maine. The family becomes even stranger once their 200 years old vampire-ancestor, Barnabas Collins, rises from his grave and moves in with them... I didn't see any of the episodes of this show, so I can absolutely not compare it with the film - but it seemed to be quite popular in its time and it seems to have still some cult following now.

I knew that this film bombed at the box office, but it usually doesn't bother me, so I decided to give it a chance, just setting my expectation level at ""really not high"". Sadly, it was not nearly low enough and therefore I was VERY disappointed.

To put things very bluntly, this film is BORING. It is definitely NOT FUNNY - I couldn't find even one really good joke in it. Visually, there are some scenes in which you can still see some of talent Tim Burton knew how to conjure in the days of yore - but they are few... And even worse, a lot of talent was wasted here by a bland, uninspired scenario. John Depp as Barabas was of course supposed to be the main asset - and he doesn't deliver. AT ALL! With Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Lee Miller and young Chloe Grace Moretz in supporting roles there was a lot of things that could have been done - and nothing happened! For Christ sake, Tim Burton had Michelle Pfeiffer at his disposal and all he could find for her to do is to once discharge a shotgun!? Really man!? Then he even hired Christopher Lee for a cameo - and failed to do anything with such an opportunity!

As for Eva Green, here I confess to an element of subjectivity, because I simply cannot stand her, but here, playing the main villain (and a very evil and depraved one) she was probably completely in her element - and yet, her character is also a huuuuge disappointment...

Tim Burton made some great movies in the past, like ""Beetlejuice"", two ""Batman"" films, ""Mars Attacks"", ""Sleepy Hollow"" (I didn't see ""Sweeney Todd"" yet) - but both ""Alice in the Wonderland"" and ""Dark Shadows"" were complete failures... I am afraid that he simply burned out - which would be a great pity... As for Johny Depp, he also appeared in a lot of great films: the first ""Pirates of Caribbean"" of course, but also ""Ninth Gate"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Secret Window"" and of course ""The Brave"", which he also directed (it is one of the most shocking and creepiest films I ever saw) - but even his talent couldn't save this failed thing...

When this film ended I was mostly relieved that this ordeal was over, but also sad, because a lot effort and talent was wasted here - and I simply cannot understand why... My sincere advice is to AVOID IT!",1413763200,,2911,4.441947565543071

I guess you had to be there--about 50 years ago. Maybe, that was state of the art at the time. So, I don't really compare the two. I let this stand completely on it's own and I give it 4 stars. I thought it was funny. I thought Depp did (as always) a good job. This is tongue-in-cheek. No, it is not a masterpiece and the character of Barnabus did not require Depp to dig deep (he is a completely capable and amazing actor (The Libertine). I like Tim Burton and his quirky ways.

4975660,5,B00683T5CW,"I was a fan of the original Dark Shadows series on TV...rushed home every day from school to watch it.  I was a bit thrown off that this version would be called a 'comedy', so I never had an interest in seeing it.  My granddaughter watched it and was wondering how it compared to the series, so I decided to watch it.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance as Barnabas Collins, from his accent and soft manner of speaking to his haircut.  In the original series, Barnabas looked like any other person but this version has Barnabas with white skin and deep circles around his eyes...however, he does not stand out as much as you might think...he is not scary, in fact he is very likable.  The storyline follows the original series, with Angelique in a fury because Barnabas does not return her love.  There are some differences, with Roger Collins being a thieving self absorbed creep and Caroline being an angry teenager who becomes a werewolf, but it fits well into this story.  Also, Barnabas is released from his tomb into a more modern time, with electricity and automobiles, and his adjustment from the past to this future is fun.  There is humor in this version, but it is subtle and enjoyable.  For all the fans of the original Dark Shadows, I suggest you watch the 90 minute movie ""House of Dark Shadows"" (original cast) to refresh your memory, then watch this one.  Or, you can do as I did...watch the original series on DVD (available on Amazon and Netflix).",1412294400,,1502,4.630188679245283

4975767,5,B00683T5CW,"Barnabas (Depp), having been buried for 196 years, maintained impressive and often entertaining use of old English, while still being easy to understand. Many entertaining and funny moments are due to the fact that he is so out of place as a vampire buried in 1776 now living in 1972. The soundtrack is very authentic to the date, which helps the film provide a fun escape to the early 70s, for those who enjoy venturing to settings other than modern day, or whoever loves the 70s. The movie also includes an interesting performance from Alice Cooper.

The murder scenes, committed by the vampire Barnabas of course, were thrilling (especially of the doctor) but not too gruesome for the squeamish. Barnabas is reunited with his true love that was killed by a witch in the 1700s. The rest I will leave unspoiled.

Depp drones his way through a quasi-English Accent as the ancient relative, cursed by a still 'living"" witch, [the oddly photographed Eva Green - who is a stunning beauty].  Is she be Samamtha's evil twin - twice-removed [""Bewitched""]  ... OR perhaps she skilled out of  Bryan Forbes' ""Stepford""?

4975777,5,B00683T5CW,"I was ten years old when the Dark Shadows series premiered on television.  I found it on TV after school one day towards the end of its run and watched whenever I could thereafter.  Since I missed probably the first three or four years, I never understood the backstory of the ""bad blood"" (pardon the pun) between Angelique and Barnabas.  I just remembered her as being this very mysterious woman from another time and place and that they had some sort of history together.  This movie, while not a slavish reboot, was reasonably true to the series, at least regarding the relationship between Angelique and Barnabas (at least from what I've since read) and I was able to finally understand it.  A tale of unrequited love and its supernatural consequences, that!  But I digress.  Anyway, Johnny Depp and Eva Green are the cast standouts, though the rest are no slouches either.  Never having seen a Tim Burton movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I read that both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are fans of the TV series and I think because of that, some people were expecting an homage to the series.  In my opinion, these people went away disappointed.  I would classify this movie as a dramedy--a drama with a lot of comedic moments, most of which involved Barnabas' attempts to come up to speed in the new century in which he finds himself.  I apologize for the rambling review so far.  Bottom line:  Even though I am a fan of the original series, I was not put off by a Dark Shadows dramedy and enjoyed this movie very much.

4975792,5,B00683T5CW,"DARK SHADOWS is a great Tim Burton / Johnny Depp film, a wonderful neo-gothic comedy, and an excellent tribute to / parody of Dan Curtis' original TV horror soap. Depp's vampiric Barnabas Collins is hilarious and perfectly grim. Eva Green is also quite good in her sinister role as  Barnabas' spiteful nemesis, Angelique Bouchard. Michele Pfeiffer returns to Burton-land as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Rising star Chloe Grace Moretz (KICK-ASS, LET ME IN, CARRIE) continues her rise as the scene-stealing Carolyn Stoddard. Of course, Helena Bonham Carter is on hand as Dr. Julia Hoffman. DARK SHADOWS, though very humorous, is also nice and creepy, w/ more of the red stuff than most PG-13 movies. The storyline is quite satisfying for fans of the original show, while not alienating the uninitiated. Taking place in 1972, the clothes, cars, and music capture much of that decades' ambiance. Watch for Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper in cameos! The fun factor is high...",1398556800,,970,5.139240506329114

I never watched the TV series of the same name, so it is hard to compare the two for me. Browsing through the reviews it appears that a fair number of the TV show's fans do not like this movie. that is understandable. A TV show with daily episodes for more than 5 years is a completely different animal from a movie that lasts a couple of hours.

Depp is not a great actor IMO, but I think he did a credible job here as a nearly 200 YO vampire (Barnabas Collins) who is set free from his coffin in the 1970's. Collins finds that the Collins name and fortune has not fared well in his absence and he sets out to improve both. The witch who imprisoned him has spent the ensuing time destroying the Collins name and fortune.

It was a fun vampire movie. Nothing great, but entertaining and that is what I want in a vampire movie. It is not horribly ghoulish, nor is there a lot of blood and gore. There is an edge of humor now and than that I enjoyed, along with the more serious vampire stuff.",1396310400,,1083,4.00462962962963

The writing is solidly funny, with Shakespearean insults rolling off Johnny Depp's tongue, dry wit from supporting characters, and a satisfying ending that allows Chloe Moretz to shine (she does a fabulous job through the whole movie).

The brief 1991 NBC-TV nighttime remake of the same name, though still a gothic-horror story, had none of the charm and humor of the original daytime soap.

Then comes along this motion-picture version, which attempts to transform a classic gothic story into a ""comedy"" ... the outcome is a total disaster.  Not funny at all.  Johnny Depp is a very talented actor, but his acting abilities cannot make up for a horrible script.  If you want to watch a ""Dark Shadows"" movie, then go for the ""House of Dark Shadows"" film from 1970, recently released on DVD, starring the original cast from the ABC series.  Still a ""B-movie,"" but a darn good vampire flick.  Doesn't have the humor of the TV series, but at least it is watchable.",1394668800,3,898,4.717948717948718

Being a Dark Shadows fan from the TV series, I was looking forward to Tim Burtons version.  Burton is a very on and off director for me.  He sometimes makes great films like Beetlejuice and then makes awful ones like Planet of the Apes.

This time hes off.

Parts of the film are similar to the TV series by Dan Curtis.  Victoria Winters (not her real name) goes to Collinwood for a job as a governess for David, a kid who is odd and has a doctor who counsels him.

Victoria sees things.  She has a dark past with her parents callously sending her off to an asylum because she sees things.  As Barnabas later points out, they should be sent to hell.  Nice line!

The story is really between two protagonists:  Angelique (who has been putting the Collins out of the fishing business for 100 years) and Barnabas (recently risen from the grave where Angelique put him, killing for blood).

The film does not know whether its a comedy or a horror movie.  The original soap opera was campy in many ways and I did not expect that.  But Barnabas being a dope with Victoria (who looks just like his lost love Josette, who woulda thought!) and at the same time slaughtering a bunch of hippies at a campfire.

Bottom line:  If you're looking for nostalgia, forget it.  As far as a Burton film goes, it has its moments of interest and comedy, but really, its worth a rental and thats about it.",1388361600,,1396,4.38671875

If you are fan of the great original TV show, run very fast and far from this garbage. Depp is a good actor and could have been a great Barnabas Collins had he played it more seriously and respectfully. Jonathan Frid died just before this was released so he was fortunately spared seeing this desecration of his great Barnabas Collins character. They did not have to make a carbon copy of the original, but this is like remaking a Three Stooges film into a Shakespearean drama. There is no point in doing that, as there is no point in watching this film if you are expecting anything resembling the original Dark Shadows. A sadly wasted opportunity, I wish I could get the time back that I wasted on this. If you are a masochistic Dark Shadows fan (or a fan of really bad movies in general), then you might get something out of this. Wish I could give it zero stars or better yet a negative number of stars.

4975869,2,B00683T5CW,"The original DARK SHADOWS was a soap opera that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971.  The series did not draw a significant audience and was on the verge of cancellation when creator and producer Dan Curtis began adding supernatural storylines.  Suddenly the ratings took off, and the series remained popular until changing tastes, a lack of fresh material, and unusually high production costs brought it to a sudden end.

Over the years there have been two films with the original cast, HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS and NIGHT OF DARK SHADOWS, and two attempts at a series revival.  In 2012 20th Century Fox released a star-studded feature film titled DARK SHADOWS, developed and directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Helena Boham Carter.  The film received mixed reviews, and although it did reasonably well in America and even better in Europe, it was regarded as a box office disappointment.

The film begins with a five minute recap of the basic soap opera storyline, radically condensed and significantly tweaked.  Barnabas Collins (Depp) narrates his life from his boyhood in England to coming of age in America, the son of a prosperous family.  Although he has an physical affair with servant girl Angelique (Eva Green), it is really Josette (Bella Heathcote) he loves--and Angelique, secretly a powerful witch, responds by killing his parents, driving Josette to suicide, and turning Barnabas into a vampire.

All of this is preface: the film actually begins when Barnabas is accidentally freed from the coffin in which Angelique has trapped for close to two hundred years.  He experiences considerable culture shock, but he nonetheless finds his way to the family home, Collinwood, where he enters into a pact with family matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer) to revive the family fortunes.  His relationship with the family is complicated by governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote again), who bears a remarkable resemblance to Josette.  But Angelique is still lurking about, determined to gain Barnabas' love, even if she has to destroy the entire family to do it.

The movie is very stylish in terms of designs and visuals, but although the script starts out well and finishes well, it has a great big huge sagging middle.  There are occasionally effective moments of parody and a few interesting special effects, but that's pretty much it.  Depp is merely adequate.  Pfeiffer is wasted.  Helena Bonham Carter is miscast.  The plot is fairly uninteresting and the script uninspired.

When the film debuted a good many critics commented that while Burton and Depp have done several good films together, their artistic collaboration seems to have run its course, and they would be better off going in different directions.  Much the same could be said of Burton and Helena Bohnam Carter; Burton seems determined to cast his girlfriend in one film after another, but he never seems to find her an appropriate part, and she is particular dire as Dr. Hoffman.

DARK SHADOWS isn't as bad as its detractors claim.  Unfortunately, it isn't as good as its supporters would have you believe.  In the end, it is trivial.  Recommended to hardcore fans of Burton and his stars, but that's all.

4975873,4,B00683T5CW,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just a quick mini review of this Tim Burton movie...

Dark Shadows (2012) is a movie version of the old TV series from the late '60s and early '70s.  However, this movie is more of a blend of horror and camp, way more so than the TV series was.  The things I liked about the movie were the dark atmospheres, the special effects (though much of the time they looked so artificial), Johnny Depp's acting, and the camp element.  This is basically a lighthearted horror movie with some dark atmospheres.  This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and you as the viewer shouldn't, either.  If you keep this in mind while watching it, I think you'll have a fun time.

4975876,5,B00683T5CW,"When the opening credits played to Nights in White Satin, I was done in! To have a creative pair like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton collaborate again is like getting a big gift with a bow on it. We couldn't wait to open it and see what treats we had in store! This time it's a high-concept comedy.

Late in the 18th century, handsome young Barnabas Collins was the object of unwanted affection from a witch who, out of spite, turned him into a vampire, had him enclosed in a chained casket and buried for 196 years in the New England woods. After a construction crew unearths the casket and cuts the chains in 1972, he is free to vamp about and quench a powerful thirst! Along with seeing that his once-grand family estate has fallen into ruin, Barnabas is nonplussed by horseless carriages, McDonald arches and asphalt. There are endless opportunities to show that our hero is indeed, a stranger in a strange land.

These folks make it fun:
  * Johnny Depp (""Sweeney Todd"") is courtly and confused. He has lost the love of his life, so he isn't above a little diversion with that seductive witch.
  * Michelle Pfeiffer (""New Year's Eve"") is the current lady of the house, trying to hold together the family traditions and a nearly bankrupt fish-packing company.
  * Eva Green (""Perfect Sense"") is that evil witch who was deter- mined to have him for all eternity, now she will settle for ruining the Collins family fortune and reputation.
  * Helena Bonham Carter (""The King's Speech"") is the tipsy doctor/ counselor/psychiatrist (I couldn't tell) who seems to live in the Collins mansion.
  * Bella Heathcote (''In Time"") is both Barnabas' true love from his youth and the family governess in 1972.

Some samples: Because they chose to set this production in 1972, the movies on the local marquee are Superfly and Deliverance. Karen Carpenter sings Top of the World while Barnabas tries to see how she got into that accursed box! He finds a lava lamp endlessly fascinating and is shocked to see that one secret chamber in the family ""pile"" is full of macram. When Alice Cooper is hired to entertain, Barnabas takes one look and says ""That's the ugliest woman I've ever seen!"" As a red convertible approaches the Collins' mansion, the theme from A Summer Place sweeps through the theater.

This is a reminder that the Depp/Burton team is alive and well, despite some third-act problems which they camouflaged with lots of CGI and blowie uppie stuff. The screening audience was noisy, appreciative and highly entertained, so the sequel that seems to be hinted at, will also do well.

4975886,3,B00683T5CW,"There's a lot to like in Dark Shadows, but somehow it doesn't quite equal the sum of its parts. Many of the performances are very good, the cinematography is gorgeously gothic, the music is moody and effective, and the setting -- a gothic version of coastal Maine -- is suitably evocative. But where the film lags is, I think, in tone. It's sometimes funny but still not quite a comedy, but also not quite the melodramatic horror/romance story it's based on. So it does many things well, but none of them great, and it feels like a few different movies stitched together.

I wish Burton and Depp had fully committed to the source material and done a more faithful, modern reinterpretation. Instead, we got something that's not quite an adaptation and not quite a parody. And worse yet, its poor box office performance has probably set the franchise back a few decades as well. I think it will be a long time before we see another iteration of Dark Shadows, and that's the real shame here.",1383609600,,988,4.613636363636363

4975897,5,B00683T5CW,"Personally loved this film.  Very much in the same spirit as Beetlejuice.  Sorry 60's Dark Shadows fan but this isn't the ultra serious remake you were hoping for but then again you all do realize the old show actually used rubber bats on strings as props...I mean Scooby-Doo had better quality control than Dark Shadows.

Tim Burton has never been bound by source materials and that is why people either love his work or hate it.  Here Burton does pay tribute to the old show but only enough to serve as a basis, a starting point to grow an original story from.  While Burton may have skimmed some of the finer plot points of a daytime soap that had over couple hundred episodes the film itself never loses that ""anything goes"" convenient story-telling that is found in both day time soap operas and 60's horror.  (One of the reasons that made Dark Shadows a hit in the 60's.)  Indeed this film feels as if its Burton directing a well acted and produced Hammer or Roger Corman horror film.

This is not a fanboy movie.  If you're looking for the next Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, or Dark Knight turn around.  I myself like those films but I often get tired with film makers trying to turn everything into the next epic franchise.  This Dark Shadows movie is a Friday night, pizza and a movie type of movie. Its a fun date movie.  Its pure entertainment that rather have fun then get weighed down by taking itself too serious.

The film is witty, engaging, and visually beautiful to look at (the backgrounds and sets look great on Blu-Ray as does Eva Green and Michelle Phieffer).  The cast was excellent in this film and they seem to enjoy playing their quirky characters.  I only wish the film would have spent 15 minutes more on developing some of the minor characters like Johnny Lee Miller's Roger.  But I think WB and Burton might have been thinking there would be time for that in a sequel.  Lastly the film boast one heck of a soundtrack mixed with Danny Elfman's haunting score and groovy tunes from the early 70's.",1381276800,,2028,4.512328767123288

Better than Twilight and Alice in Wonderland and in line with the 1992 Dracula from Francis Ford Coppola.""

PRO: Tongue-in-cheek and dry sense of humour (especially from Depp's character). Depp's acting chomps. Scenery and set design. Some of the supporting work (esp. from the shy girl, Hit Girl/Chloe Moretz, and Bonham Carter). A touching ending and prologue.

CON: Storyline and its execution. Plotholes throughout and pacing is a tad inconsistent. Green could be a little less of a stereotype/cliche.",1377820800,,817,5.425196850393701

The film itself is a hoot.  Johnny Depp turns in yet another excellent performance.  Anyone who's even passingly familiar with the 1970s will howl with laughter at some of the sly humor in the film.  And though I didn't watch the original series way back when, what research I've done seems to indicate that the film doesn't stray all that far from the basics of that series.  Also, the use of classic 70s songs (you'll love how they used the Carpenters' ""Top of the World"") must have cost the filmmakers a pretty penny, but I loved how they used the music to dovetail with the story.

4975928,1,B00683T5CW,"Many of these reviews are written from the perspective of fans of the original soap (who either hate this film or enjoyed it), or people who have never seen the original soap (who either loved it or thought it was just sort of decent, but not great). I'd like to offer a third perspective. My first introduction to the world of Dan Curtis' ""Dark Shadows"", although began for me as a child, did not begin with the original 1967 daytime soap.  It began at the age of ten, in 1990, with Mr. Curtis' Dark Shadows Revival Series that aired as a Prime Time drama, replacing the time-slot once occupied by Twin Peaks. Although that series only lasted one season (due mostly to interruptions from network news reporting on the beginning conflicts of the Gulf War), I remember the experience well. I had a TV in my room, and even though I was strictly forbidden from watching it by my parents because it aired past my ""bedtime"", I would sneak watching it with the volume turned down low enough that they wouldn't hear it. That version of Dark Shadows, featuring Ben Cross as Barnabas Collins, became my ""childhood"" Dark Shadows memories, much in the same way the 1967 soap was for the children who ""ran home from school"" to see it. Instead of running home, I snuck staying up past my bedtime. That version of DS has a strong tone of gothic horror to it, and because of the updated effects and the format of being a prime time show (as opposed to a low-budget daily soap, which was filmed mere hours before being aired), it also has a strong sense of seriousness and realness to it. Upon watching the revival series, I immediately fell in love with Dark Shadows, and even though I was disappointed with the cancellation of the series, it lead me to watching the original soap (rented on VHS from Blockbuster Video, remember those days?), and the two original DS films, ""House of Dark Shadows"", and 'Night of Dark Shadows"", which I also fell in love with. Because of the Revival Series (which strongly mirrored the plot and tone of ""House of DS""), I became a die-hard cult Dark Shadows fan over the years.

Enter Tim Burton. When I found out that he was doing a ""Dark Shadows"" movie I was highly optimistic and excited. Then I found out it was going to be a ""dark comedy."" Still I held out hope, and waited for the trailers. Then I saw said trailers, and my utter crushing disappointment hit me like a hard blow to the stomach. Still I gave the film a chance, hoping that I could look at from a different perspective. I couldn't, and I won't. You see, even though I noticed the melodramatic acting, low budget, prop failures, and slight camp when watching the original 1967 soap, I was able to tune out those things. I simply didn't see them. Because my intro to the world of DS began with the 1990 series, I saw the ""camp""  of the original series as a product of the show's format; a product of being a daytime show in the 60s, with an almost non-existant budget, and extremely short daily shooting schedule. For me it wasn't about it being a ""soap"", because I knew the story Dark Shadows was trying to tell. I knew that story was a gothic horror story, much in the same vein as Stoker's ""Dracula"", or Shelley's ""Frankenstein"", or the ""Picture of Dorian Gray"", or Hawthorn's ""The House of the Seven Gables."" I knew the story was intended to be taken seriously, despite the flaws of its format. To me, it seemed like Mr. Curtis always wanted Dark Shadows to be more like the 1990 series and his two films, House and Night. That was when I feel Mr. Curtis was in his element (look at his ""Trilogy of Terror"" films for instance). I feel that Curtis was always held back from presenting DS the way he meant it to be when it was restricted by that daily soap format, and that his short-lived 1990 series and two films was how he really wanted to tell the story.

That is why I find Burton's lighthearted attempt at poking fun at the original series in his film (even if he intended to do so in a respectful way), to be so insulting. I just can't see Dan Curtis (if he were alive) approving of this comedic version. I know this just from watching Mr. Curtis' films, which are pure straight-up classic horror in the tradition of the Hammer Horror films of old. I don't know why Burton just can't do a straight-up horror film (the closest we've gotten yet, and in my opinion, his last good film, was ""Sleepy Hollow""). He could have made this a great film and a great addition to the Dark Shadows legacy. He missed the mark completely. Perhaps Mr. Burton should stick to what he is best at: art direction, and films like his ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Frankenweenie."" Leave the serious gothic horror stories to the pros, Mr. Burton!

Bottom line: if you are a fan of the gothic horror element of the original series, a fan of the 1990 revival series, or the two original films (House & Night), you are probably going to hate this movie with a passion. If you are a fan of serious treatments of literary gothic horror, like Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", or Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"", or stories like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, you will also probably dislike this film. If you however are a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's typical (and at this point, painfully predictable) quirky lighthearted approach to the macabre, then you may like this film. In either case, I invite you to seek out and watch the true Dark Shadows, both the original and revival series, and the two original series films.",1376524800,15,5510,4.511511511511512

4975932,1,B00683T5CW,"I love Tim Burton's movies.  Sadly his Dark Shadows is almost flat-out BAD.
The usual Burton dark humor and satirical characters are there and are
well-cast, the sets have the usual pseudo-horror touch and the costumes
and technical aspects are first rate.  BUT, and this is a big but (remember
Simone the waitress with Pee Wee in the dinosaur?) the script is totally inane, lame
and ready flame.

It is always a risky business doing an adaptation of a popular television series as
a feature-length movie and this one proves that even the greatest most imaginative
director and expert cast of actors cannot save a fundamentally half-assed screenplay.

What a cast though!  Wasted wasted wasted.  Johnny Depp is his usual great self as
Barnabas Collins, he single-handedly saves the movie from total DOA status with his
sly, funny delivery of the occasional comedic lines.  And Helena Bonham-Carter is
very funny as Dr Julia Hoffman. [Spoiler alert];  After this character dies the movie
nosedives.

Michelle Pfeiffer is always a reason to see a flick, but her transition from the
marvelous cat woman in Batman Returns to the vague and languid Elizabeth Collins
is almost a total flop.  Again, not her fault.  The script strikes again.

Eva Green is so beautiful but looks ridiculous in a blonde wig, and her American
accent is noticeably studied and fake.

This movie is, in a word, awful.  I am so sorry about this.  It is a first in my
experience of Tim Burton.

The movie begins in Liverpool 1760, where young Barnabas Collins departs with his upper-class family.  They start a town called Collinsport (which looks like Maine or Nova Scotia), and as it grew, they built the family estate Collinwood. Angelique, who was of a lower class, wanted Barnabas, but it was not to be, so she dabbled in black magic and caused quite a bit of trouble for the Collins family, and turned Barnabas into a vampire.

Now, after being buried for 196 years, Barnabas is back!

Most likely, what I just told you and more is right out of the old TV series. Depp's performance, along with his innate ability to handle a diverse collection of acting rolls and on-point makeup, coupled with his deliciously dry sense of humor, makes this movie very entertaining. Tim Burton's movies are always a treat, too, so Depp and Burton together make a great team.",1374364800,,1112,4.567839195979899

4975953,4,B00683T5CW,"I have never been a fan one way or the other of Dark Shadows, airing as it did between my ages of 3-8, and thus having no interest in afternoon tv of any kind at that age. I am a fan of Tim Burton, however, even as I'm aware of his hits and misses, which made me curious to see his version of Dark Shadows. I've seen it on the big screen and now a handful of times on HBO, a testament to the fact that I find it worth repeated viewings.

This movie bears little resemblance to the program - the words of the many dissenting opinions - putting it squarely in line with the majority of movie versions of old tv programs. It's a safe plan that shuns creativity for easy manipulation of a particular fan base.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are reportedly a part of that reverent fan base, but that doesn't stop Burton from employing his deft macabre touch and penchant for overblown conclusions to tell a satirical tale of an cursed man (Barnabas Collins) who comes back to 1972 New England to restore the family name and settle an old score with the witch who cursed him (played deliciously by the lovely Eva Green).

The jokes are mostly of the fish out of water variety, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and the aforementioned Green clearly relish their campy roles, the movie has silly sub-plots and could be trimmed by a good fifteen minutes, and the ending is a typically epic Burton confrontation, yet in spite of all that, this movie was very enjoyable for me. There are some truly funny moments and Depp's campilicious performance keeps the silliness rolling along. I've been critical of Depp turning into a cartoon with his roles, but for some reason, his turn here works for me. No accounting for taste, aye?

Dark Shadows is played for laughs and irony, and it worked for me.  It reminds me of The Brady Bunch movies, and those too are funny yet irreverent to the source material. If you approach this movie without expectations and prejudice, you might enjoy the ride as much as I do. If you go into it expecting a loving recreation of a beloved tv show, you'll most likely be very disappointed.

4975958,3,B00683T5CW,"Well, there are things to like and things to dislike about this odd film.  The film is a nice blend of comedy and horror; however the horror might be better described as dark humor. Tim Burton is a visual genius and his films are eye stunners. Based on the old television soap opera, Dark Shadows has visual effects that would be the envy of those involved in the television version back in 1968. Interestingly, Depp is not sexy in this film. He is stiff and creepy but he never emits sexual vibes. His make-up, including the greasy black hair that encircles his white face, is just creepy, never sexy.
The character of Angelique, the white witch seeking revenge for being rejected by Barnabas Collins 250 years ago. When Barnabas is finally released from his tomb after 200 years of entrapment, Angelique continues her revenge against the Collins family. In the final fight between Angelique and the Collins family, I actually found the wood-work carving and architectural details coming to life as a visual treat. Eva Green actually out-acts the rest of the cast in this film.

Whereas the visuals are entertaining, the plot is a bit weak and is not really related that much to the original television series that I watched as a kid. When it was time for Dark Shadows, we would jump out of the pool and watch with dripping swim suits. I don't think this much enthusiasm is evident in this new interpretation.",1373760000,3,1410,4.704453441295547

4975972,4,B00683T5CW,"I liked the series back then...not so much the movies.
I didn't catch this version in the theater because it looked really goofy via the trailers.

But....after watching a few times, I began to appreciate the quirkiness.

A few of the many differences between this movie and the TV series/movie:

1. A vampire that looks like a vampire.
2. 200 years out-of-time person acts like one (Depp flawlessly uttering a script straight from a Victorian Thesaurus) .
3. A real world plotline of sorts.
4. This version of Barnabas cares for his family; the previous version slaughters them like cattle.
5. A sense of humor...finally.

I really didn't want a remake of House of Dark Shadows, a blood-fest of killing everybody that depressed me when it came out. By contrast, the construction worker massacre was bloody, yet brilliantly executed with almost comical visuals. The weed smoking scene was also oddly appropriate for the time, while having a wretched, screaming, but-no-blood-shown climax.
Helena Bonham Carter's Julia Hoffman was brutally funny (hypnotizing a vampire is pretty odd twist).

Of course Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would humor it up a little! The source material was humorless and needed a fresh perspective, though I could've done without many of the juvenile puns. A serious re-boot was already attempted and it didn't last past one season. The original formula should best remain part of TV history.
The music track was very reminiscent of Robert Colbert's scores, without the overbearing soap opera melodramatic sound.

So lighten up...I think they did a pretty good job of avoiding recycling a boring gothic vampire story that has been made over and over. While also avoiding an overboard special-effects, slasher flick.",1372118400,3,1738,5.1453900709219855

Dark Shadows succeeded because it took itself seriously and that is where good camp comes from.  If they wanted to play that up, they should have gone Ed Wood style.  This is a monstrosity.  Poorly cast, horrible screenplay ... a big mess.  Michelle Pfieffer is the only one who did not make me throw things at the TV.  Avoid at all costs if you've ever seen or enjoyed the original.

4975977,1,B00683T5CW,"Burton ruined a show that for all it's flaws was still engaging, frightening, developed and entertaining.
In the 1990's there was an all too short remake that also captured the heart of Dark Shadows.
For a person who claims to have loved the TV show Burton managed to defecate on the memory by turning it into an unfunny piece of crap. (Amazon will not let me say what I want here)
When this movie was first announced and it was said that Depp was playing Barnabas I was excited. He is a good actor with great breadth and talent.
What could have been a suspenseful and terrifying tale does more to ruin vampires than Stephanie Meyers with that twilight train wreak.
There are not enough tortures, insults or methods of inflicting pain upon Burton for destroying Dark Shadows. Some one put a stake through Tim and this s*** film before he makes another.
Shame on you Tim, eons of shame. My childhood was raped.
Aside from Tim's blatant disregard for the TV series he takes a show that was developed over hundreds of episodes and crams so much into it that the only character with any semblance of development (minimal that it is) is Barnabas. It was free on HBO... so I watched I saw 2 main problems. 1) it is a comedy not a horror. In my mind it disrespects on the original, and poor comedy at that. 2) it doesn't even develop any of the other characters at all AND all but completely ignores the Victoria Winters character.
At it's core the original Dark Shadows was a tragic love story between Barnabas, a several hundred year old vampire and Victoria's uncanny resemblance to his long lost love Jos&eacute;tte Duperies. But they basically threw in the major characters that were in the original series jut to get them all in an didn't really use them for more than set dressing for Depp. They were never fleshed out at all, provided no motivation and you had no idea who they even were (unless you knew from before).
Did you even know that many stars from the TV show made a mass cameo? Including Jonathan Fried? The original Barnabas? I didn't and I didn't after seeing it because they were just there not acknowledged.
Burton didn't just drop the ball, he never even touched the ball.
Epic Fail Tim, EPIC FAIL",1371772800,9,2214,4.5375

He looks awesome in this movie, there is definately the gothic aspect which is fantastic.  Michelle Phiffer is cool, she usually picks good movies.

4975980,1,B00683T5CW,"Surely no director with so much talent has wasted it on the drivel Tim Burton has.  For the past ten or so years he has done everything in his limited power to demonstrate his total lack of imagination.  Yes.  The man noted for his unorthodox style hasn't the imagination to make a movie unmarred by lack of structure, by characters who are hopelessly one dimensional, by stories that are absurd in the pejorative sense of the word (rather than the Beckettian sense).  The only film he has made that might be considered great is ""Ed Wood"" which is ironic as Burton may soon be closely identified with that talentless hack.  His ""Alice"" film was an insult leveled against not only Lewis Carroll's fertile imagination, but also of every child who wondered at the story of Alice's adventures.
""Dark Shadows"" is a abortive remake of ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"".  You'd think by now Burton would have made more than one film that might join the ranks of his contemporaries such as Tarentino, the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson to name a few.  The Coens' also are stylists, but not at the expense of substance.  They mine every genre for all they're worth, sometimes mixing them superbly as in their masterpieces ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"".  Burton simply has nothing to say cinematically (or any other way for that matter) in this he is akin to Depalma who has never had an original thought, cinematic or otherwise, instead preferring to wallow in interring ideas that worked when he was still cutting his teeth.  Burton's once lauded ""Batman"" films are horribly dated.  Style alone can take one only so far - one gets the feeling he has no feeling for the craft to which he has devoted his life.  Sample dialogue: ""I'm a werewolf.  Deal with it.""  And it boasts a montage while Karen Carpenter warbles ""Top of The World""Avoid this film.  It is as empty, as heartless, as soulless, as bereft of intelligence as a turtle's shell without the turtle.",1371513600,3,1951,4.747774480712166

4975982,5,B00683T5CW,"I really loved this version. My mom used to watch the original series & I somewhat know the version. I wasn't really expecting it to be funny at all so when I laughed as Johnny Dep woke up the drunk I realized it was worth watching. What was refreshing is that there wasn't any nude body parts showing & the 2 sex scenes were amusing. The first time I saw ""True Blood"" I was actually shocked by what was shown. Yes, I'm 53 & not a prude at all. I just think some shows can go a bit overboard. HBO was not like it is today, yet even regular TV shows more than what I'm use to. I agree, times changed but perhaps the simpler times can be more refreshing too. Leave something to the viewer's imagination. I like the Underworld series & the scenes where Sonia is with Lucien & Selene is with Michael are lovely. They are making love which is how is should be.

This Dark Shadows, as I stated above was great! It had some sex not being graphic, no graphic violence & comedy. There is so much horror going on in the real world I prefer to laugh when I'm relaxing. Do like horror flicks as long as they aren't too graphic. Two movies I cannot watch ""Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""30 days of Night"". I saw parts of ""30 days of night"" & know the end but cannot sit down & watch from beginning to end. Must admit some graphic scenes but there is still suspense.",1371427200,2,1343,4.145593869731801

The story is fun, and at times funny, with a groovy setting in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are a few times when Burton misses a chance for humor, like when the vampire feasts on hippies (shouldn't he get stoned, and maybe loosen up a bit?). There's a hilarious scene of supernatural wall climbing, ornament-smashing ultra-sex (think Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone in The Professional, but with super powers). Nice appearance by Alice Cooper, singing his ""Ballad Of Dwight Fry"", which is the inspiration for one of the characters' back stories.",1371254400,,727,4.91869918699187

When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought they had taken another dear to my heart childhood TV show and turn it into a complete piece of comedy disaster.  Wacky comedy works for TV shows to movie like Saturday Night Live's Blue Brothers and Mchale's Navy but not on average. That why I skipped it in theaters.  When I came across it on HB0 last night I decided to give it a try. Much to my unexpected delight that first 45 minutes or so was dark with the Gothic under tones that my memories bring to mind of the old series without having reviewed the original stuff on You Tube. Course the movie is a bit camp but that is part of the films appeal to those who still love the drama of late 1960s and 1970s which one today would find a bit silly compare to modern Gothic horror works out there.  I did find some of the jokes dumb as you often get from a olden TV show turn movie like the McDonald's sign in the background after the vampire has fed in one scene considering you had Dark shadows in late 1960s and early 1970s, House of Dark Shadows in 1970s, Night of dark Shadows in early 1980s and Dark Shadows Revival in 1990s Tim had a lot of Dark Shadows material to try to fit into a working story plot for his film.",1370822400,,1279,4.108

There was nothing particularly terrible about the movie, but absolutely nothing commendable either.  Bland dialogue, scant plot elements that barely hold the scenes together and a crippling lack of memorability left me wondering how a movie with such a great cast (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Elementary's Johnny Lee Miller, etc. . . ) could still manage to be utterly without charm.  The film manages to look stylized, like most Tim Burton projects, but it also lacked the truly unique and over-the-top artistic flourishes of Beetlejuice or Edward Scissorhands.  I would compare this movie to the Addams Family sequels in terms of quality and style, but it didn't even live up to the sentimental charm of the first Addams Family movie and maintained the made-for-TV quality predominantly due to the mediocre plot and dialogue.",1370563200,5,956,5.108974358974359

4975995,4,B00683T5CW,"Those who remember dashing home from school to catch up on the latest happenings in Collinsport (oh what we would have given for a VCR!) have probably told others about this marvelously quirky show.  From time to time it has resurfaced on cable, experienced a short lived reboot but somehow just never seemed to catch on the way some other classic shows have.  This remake with big name stars offered so much promise, and happily delivered an interesting product.  It is not completely faithful to the original, but then what remake is?  It does capture lots of the quirky charm of the original if not the delightful feelings of terror, (there is never any doubt that Barnabas will triumph in this one) and many of the familiar characters and plot lines return.

For those unfamiliar with the story the Collins family traveled to America from Liverpool in the 19th century to establish a fishing business in the colonies.  The family heir, Barnabas was cursed by a powerful witch, Angelique, when he scorned her for the beautiful Josette.  Barnabas, now a vampire, was imprisoned by the townspeople for 200 years when he was accidentally released in 1972.  Now Barnabas had to adapt to a greatly changed world and perhaps find a way to regain his humanity.

Burton has managed to recapture some of the innocent fun of the original series, the all powerful vampire confronting his first automobile for example, and also to poke fun at the campiness of the original, the Collins are broke but they can afford to hire a live in psychiatrist, who happens to be a drunk and just a bit nuts and a governess, but don't check her references.

Depp gives a wonderful performance as Barnabas, changing from an arrogant young man to a bewildered victim to the selfless lover with charming sensitivity reminiscent of Jonathan Frid's original portrayal.  Helena Bonham Carter's Dr Hoffman is delightfully campy although more sympathetic than the original is a delight.

The open ending, suggesting of perhaps more to come, is in keeping with the cliffhangers that kept viewers anxiously awaiting the next installment all those years ago.",1369785600,,2124,4.918767507002801

This didn't come close to the original, and the only part that was interesting to watch was when the original actor who played Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid--not too long before he passed away) was in one short walk-on part. If you liked the original Dark Shadows, you may want to save yourself from this disappointment.

The scenes with alice cooper are just great! and other scenes capture a gothic sense of dread. BUT the movie meanders off into semicomedy and not very good comedy at that. Why not make a real dark shadows movie? OH well we got the parody instead. And that's a shame.  The blu ray looks dark throughout as if filmed with gauze over the lens. This was done for atmosphere but since this is a comedy, perhaps they shouldn't have bothered.  IT's not a terrible movie though as it does feature some good scenes and the effects are great. But all killing is mostly pg rated and silly. So long term fans may want to get the real Dark shadows films on blu ray. As they exist and casual fans may like this comedy , that's not really funny.

This is not like the soap opera nor the 1971 film based on the soap opera.  This version works because Johnny Depp brings his own dark and comical style to the role.  The result is a very entertaining film that establishes its own style.  The fact that it is set in the 1970s also adds to the camp and fun.  The film is well-shot, acted with gusto and features some new twists.  This could turn into a series but lets see what happens.  Overall, this is a hip horror film from Tim Burton.  While not his best, it deserves the moniker - Burtonesque.",1367539200,,675,4.387096774193548

It gives life back into Barnabas Collins and leads to an ending that brings Barnabas back to his Josette in a delightfully humorous way. To all of you people who are convinced it should have been a serious made movie, my reply is ""suck it up"" and go on. Too many vampire stories out there for what YOU are looking for. You must not know anything of Frid, Depp or Dark Shadows fans. This was the only way it could have been done. I was quite surprised at the original casts making the cameo appearance and was touched by the way Johnny Depp said, ""Welcome to Collinwood, Sir."" when Jonanthan Frid entered  Collinwood with Kathryn-Leigh Scott and Laura Parker on their cameo appearance.  Also appearing was David Selby. Jonathan Frid passed away just before the movie came out. Thank you Tim Burton.

4976037,4,B00683T5CW,"I didn't see the tv show and know nothing about it. This review is strictly based on the movie I saw.

This is a difficult film to classify. It's dark and is played mostly straight, but it is a comedy. But it's not your typical comedy. It's goofy, clever at times, weird and unexpected. Combine that with the writing and acting and I think this is a cult classic in the making. There are lines that make you say, ""What did he just say?"" Then you have to repeat them.

Bonham-Carter is always superb. I wish she had had more to do. Pfeiffer just gets better and better. In fact, the whole cast was excellent.

If you are looking for something that makes sense, this isn't it. It gets further and further from anything that seems even slightly realistic, but if you are able to go along for the ride, you will find something about it that makes it worth while for you - particularly if you are a fan of the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp/Helena Bonham-Carter trio.",1366588800,,954,4.378531073446328

4976042,1,B00683T5CW,"One of the reasons that ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" are perfect horror comedies is because they each have a consistent tone.  ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" plays as both a standard Abbott & Costello comedy and a standard Universal horror film.  Bud & Lou play for laughs and the monsters play it straight.  The only exception is when Frankenstein's Monster recoils in horror when seeing Costello for the first time.  ""Young Frankenstein"" examines all the clichs of old ""Frankenstein"" movies, but the characters are always deadly serious.

On the other hand, I've been listening to a lot of old time radio comedy shows featuring horror stars like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre.  Some are really good (""Bob Hope"", ""Abbott & Costello""), but most of them (""Dinah Shore"", ""Command Performance"") are painful, because they are written by hacks with no love for the genre, who trot out the same references and puns every time.  They'd be unbearable if it wasn't for the gravitas brought by the stars - Peter Lorre, in particular, could make any line funny.

""Dark Shadows"" plays as if a team of writers from the ""Dinah Shore Show"" were assigned to write a straight horror movie and couldn't resist the impulse to Get a Few Boffos!  This could have been *such* a good movie, and it's just crap.  It just has no idea what kind of film it wants to be, and the mix it tries for just doesn't mix.  Barnabas Collins emerges from his coffin after 196 years and he's *really thirsty*, killing eleven construction workers luckless enough to have dug up his grave.  Then he does a lame gag with a McDonald's sign.  He brushes his teeth while looking into a mirror which doesn't reflect him.  He sleeps hanging upside down like a bat.

There are some chilling moments, as when Barnabas sadly announces to a group of hippies with whom he has been pleasantly (if inanely) conversing, that he will now have to kill all of them.  Which he does.  It wants to be a straight horror film.  It wants to be a fish-out-of-water comedy.  And it has NO clue how to put the two together.

Burton also steals the brilliant sex-so-hot-it-trashes-the-bedroom scene from ""The Tall Guy"", where Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson hilariously wrecked an entire room without the benefit of harnesses and stunt people.  It's not funny here.

Johnny Depp does what he can with the material.  For this picture, rather than channeling Michael Jackson, he's 100% doing Richard Burton as a vampire.

Eva Green is really good as Angelique, though unlike Lara Parker, her eyes are not her most prominent features.

Jackie Earle Haley is good as Willie Loomis, totally played for laughs rather than as John Karlen's angsty, guilt-ridden dweeb.

I love Helena Bonham Carter in most things, and here she's a redhead, so you're not going to catch me saying she's being anything less than magnificent.

Everbody else was ok.  Eh.

Original series stars Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby appear in the ball sequence - for four seconds.

I'm a huge fan of the original series.  I had high hopes because Tim Burton and Johnny Depp kept loudly proclaiming that THEY were fans of the original series.  As a straight vampire film with great characters and solid acting, this is a bust.  As an episode of ""The Birds-Eye Open House with Dinah Shore"", it's serviceable.  Not a bomb, but incredibly disappointing and not worth seeing.",1366243200,11,3440,4.833904109589041

It was an interesting black comedy but never should have been a black comedy.  It was campy like the original, but the original was not necessarily supposed to be campy.

Tim Burton came threw on this movie even though many bad mouth it.  What I enjoyed about the movie was the music by Danny Elfman, the special effects at the end of the movie stunning, plus major props to the make up crew on Johnny Deep's face as a vampire.  I will label this movie as either your going to like, love it, or hate it.  But like many movies if you watch it with an open mind and make up your own mind then you might enjoy it as much as I did.  From the very start I was intrested in the movie, and it never made me lost intrest maybe because I am somewhat I hopeless romantic and if it takes centuries to be with your own true love then so be it.  I was proud of Johnny Deep's character for never giving in to the evil women.  The other actors did a good job with the characters they were acting as and what they had to work with.

4976055,3,B00683T5CW,"I'm old enough to have watched Dark Shadows originally when it ran as a 30 minute daily soap, so I was well informed on the original Dark Shadows lore ... Barnabus, Quentin, Victoria, et al. From previews, I expected that this was going to deviate from the serious nature of the original material into a campy story with plenty of Johnny Depp's patented offbeat character.

I think that the creators of this film never made up their mind what kind of movie this should be though. In some scenes, Depp played an amusing fish out of water, then in the next scene he's committing cold-blooded murder. I like Depp, but I think he might have been the wrong choice for this role. It gave the film too much temptation to bring out elements of Jack Sparrow, and this movie didn't need that.

Another problem I had with the film is that after Barnabus appears in the 70s and ""reunites"" with Victoria, she suddenly disappears for an extended stretch of the film. By the time they come back to the romance, there is literally no foundation built for it.

Despite flaws, the film does have a lot of good moments. Special effects are outstanding and often spooky, as you would hope they would be. The funny moments are indeed funny ... there should have just been either more of them or none at all. The climax of the film is unusual and disturbing, even if it doesn't really make much sense or leave you with a real feeling of resolution.

Obviously, huge fans of Depp are going to purchase this film. For anyone else, I recommend catching it on cable or a modestly priced rental. While I thought the film was worth a look, it isn't one I'll care to watch a second time.",1365552000,,1658,4.462046204620462

4976073,1,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton is a very hit-or-miss director -- when he's good, he's very very good. And when he's bad... ""Planet of the Apes.""

And for many years, he and favorite star Johnny Depp wanted to make an adaptation of the classic supernatural soap ""Dark Shadows."" Except, you know, getting virtually every aspect of the story wrong -- instead of a tale of vampiric tragedy and suspense, we get an awful sitcom that tries to get all its humor from Barnabas Collins being a ""man out of time.""

About two hundred years ago, the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) took revenge on her former lover Barnabas Collins (Depp) after he jilted her. She killed his family, made his fiancee commit suicide, turned him into a vampire, and got him buried for two hundred years.

When Barnabas is accidentally dug up, it's the 1970s. After snacking on some road workers, he heads straight back to the old family manor. The Collins family -- led by the dour matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) -- has seen its fortunes decline over the centuries, and Barnabas is determined to restore them. He also immediately falls for Victoria (Bella Heathcote), who is an exact doppelganger for his dead fiancee.

However, it turns out that Angelique is still kicking around because... well, she's a witch, so apparently that makes her immortal. She's still carrying a torch for Barnabas. And she's been responsible for the family ""curse."" And, well, she's opened a rival fish cannery that is threatening the old family biz. When Barnabas turns her down again, she's out for revenge...

If you've seen even some of Tim Burton's other movies, then you know pretty much what to expect from ""Dark Shadows."" Burton is just regurgitating the same things he always does -- it stars Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, there's pancake makeup with sunken raccoon eyes, a Skellington scarecrow, gothic houses with lots of sharp angles, wild hair, etc.

Burton's style is not the problem, though... but the fact that he turned a story of tragedy and revenge into a COMEDY is. And even as a comedy, it fails.

Instead we get endless gags relying on Barnabas' culture shock (oh ha ha, he's confused by the TV), and how he's so obviously a vampire but the Collins clan never notices. And once the backstory is out of the way, Burton seems to lose interest in the plot -- he simply flings around a dozen random plot threads, culminating in a confusing deus-ex-machina climax with random ghosts and werewolves popping up to fight Angelique.

There's also an ugly misogynistic tone to the movie -- every woman is either a vengeful scorned harpy who can't move on, a vain age-obsessed skank or a blank-faced nonentity like Victoria.

Johnny Depp is admittedly doing what he can here, but the character of Barnabas is just embarrassing -- he comes across as a blithering idiot and a huge cad. Depp is charming, but not charming enough. Heathcote has the charisma and acting ability of a log, and most of the other actors are wasted (Pfeiffer, Green, Chlo Grace Moretz, Jonny Lee Miller).

It boggles the imagination that ""Dark Shadows"" was made by actual fans of the original TV show, because frankly it's hard to imagine a worse adaptation being made by people who hated it. There may be shadows, but they're not dark. They're just beige.",1364342400,10,3285,4.818827708703375

Having said that, though, if you don't know anything about the original and you come to this movie with no expectations, you might enjoy it.  At the very least, it's classic Tim Burton, if you like that kind of thing.

The really sad part for me is that people who don't know about the original show might see this movie and say ""Oh, so THAT'S Dark Shadows.""  If you're one of those people, let me assure you:  this movie is NOT Dark Shadows!!!  (To find out more about the original Dark Shadows, may I suggest you visit our podcast or the FORUM connected to that podcast, which you can get to by googling ""Dark Shadows podcast"").

4976104,1,B00683T5CW,"When I was in high school I used to rush home to watch Dark Shadows. It was one-of-a-kind for its time. Sexy vampires? Even sexier werewolves? Time shifting? Poor production values? Cringe-worthy performances? Check, check and double-check. It was delicious.

One doesn't expect remakes to be slavish to the original material, but the changes made for this version seem peculiarly ineffective. None of the menace or mystery of the original Barnabas is in evidence. Depp's Barnabas has become a creepy CEO, counting bags of coins and building up the family corporation. With his focus on birthing hips and demolishing his business rivals, he's a be-caped Mitt Romney in mime face. He strides here and there during the day(?) or cutely naps in appliance boxes. All the family knows he's a 200-year-old vampire. His finger-wiggling hypnotic spells seem oddly short-term. He's afraid of lava lamps and Karen Carpenter.

The cast is fabulous, but the performances run the gamut from wooden to stiff. When Michelle Pfeiffer's character is lifeless and Helena Bonham Carter's is merely drab and dumpy, there's something wrong. The opening scenes of Barnabas as a lad in the 18th century are captivating, but as soon as we enter the present the film falls flat. The climax is typical for films these days: designed to please tween boys, none of whom would see this in the first place.

And don't blink or you'll miss the appearances of four of the original cast members entering Collinwood for the party. Poor Jonathan Frid died shortly before this was released, most likely from embarrassment.

I read the reviews when the movie came out but finally had to watch it anyway. I wanted to like it even a little, but just couldn't.",1363478400,6,1720,4.961805555555555

Lacks the love or revenge or any plot element of most vampire stories, or any real emotional connection period. Pretty boring actually. Oh yeah, he's a vampire, he's just pale, I sorta forgot.

Depp's deadpanning is as if William Hung (American Idol super-reject) were playing the character of Charie Harper. But without the good hair and charming self-depreciation, or any talent, or supporting comedic actor.

And the daughter... a half-second reveal at the end ""wait, I'm really  werewolf""' and zero followup? WTH?

4976150,2,B00683T5CW,"Dark Shadows is based upon an older TV series from the 70s, and tells the story of a young American ""noble"" in the 1700s who is cursed to be a vampire and locked away for over 200 years. Upon awaking he is in a land he does not recognize and his family has fallen into poverty. He must raise them from their low position back to greatness and deal with the ""witch"" who cursed him so long ago...

Needless to say the premise for the story line is not that complicated and should have been a simple matter of translation to script and screen... Unfortunately that above summary fails to communicate the complexity that was involved in the classic Dark Shadows TV series, and instead of streamlining and attempting to keep the story in check due to only have 2 hours or so of film (see above summary), the writers and director decided to wast our time with hanging plot hooks that turn into confusing holes, characters that have no purpose, strange transformations never hinted at nor mentioned ever until the final act, and superfluous innuendo`s of sexual encounter that do nothing to further the plot nor develop characterization.
I normally love Tim Burton, and here his ascetic is clear to see, but his ability to weave a script into film falls apart greatly! Johnny Depp is in top form however as is most of the cast, although I felt the witch and daughter could have been a bit less ""Dramatic"".

4976178,1,B00683T5CW,"I'm glad the '70s are ""in"" again; by it's very nature, the classic Dark Shadows series is timeless. Many savor the classic gothic drama, with its tremendous cast. This spin-off film's best part, aside from the opening sequence with the train and Moody Blues (easy to script-write, a give away), is the momentary glimpse of favorites: Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker, David Selby, and Jonathan Frid; what good sports! Sadly, the new movie is not respectful of the series or actors, past and present. What a wasted opportunity, with a disappointing squandering of talent, resources, and classic story lines. Why alter the narrative so clumsily? There is no clear point of view, just a chaotic collage of images. Changing the demise of Barnabas' parents, Joshua and Naomi, is just one departure. The film drastically departs from many story-lines, and alters Maggie Evans in a bizarre way; Tim Burton turns Vickie into Maggie Evans. Except for the Moody Blues opening, Karen Carpenter (and other) music lends nothing. Burton inflicts that WHOLE Carpenter song on viewers (trite cynicism? Burton lost his mind) during what should have been a fun scene. The wrong Witch of Eastwick was cast; Susan Sarandon would have played our darkly mysterious matriarch Elizabeth Collins/Joan Bennett far better. Julia Hoffman is a throw-away part, as is Caroline - a desultory werewolf. Dr. Julia Hoffman's role is mangled, and Angelique is a brittle (literally) bore. Collinwood manor burns to the ground. What a mess, and a misuse of the goodwill numerous fans would have been happy to give. Tim Burton has his head up his wide child-bearing-sized hips. What's with that fixation? This film is the rant of a guy afraid to grow old, with riffs from his therapist's couch tossed in. There is a difference between honest vintage camp and contemporary mocking; Tim Burton lacks the ballast to discern between the two. Definition of a movie-bomb (or abomination): the Amazon trade-in value of this mint-quality is worth all of .05 cents!",1360022400,3,2018,5.081325301204819

There is no way, because they would never have made such a pitiful story and movie.  The Preview makes it look like a comedy by it's really not.  It's actually horror, but not really; horror trying to be funny.  I'm a big fan of the original series and wanted so badly for this to be a good movie.  The main problem is that the story sucks.  With 5 years of original episodes, I don't know why they couldn't come up with something good.  To make matters worse, the original music by Robert Cobert is gone too:  no ""Dark Shadows Theme"".  The only thing good I can say about the movie is that the sets, costumes, and special effects were good.  I thought Johnny Depp wasn't bad and Eva Green was good too.  It is really a disgrace they couldn't pull off a good movie.  The story is stupid, only God knows what they were trying for!

If you want to watch a movie length version of Dark Shadows watch ""House of Dark Shadows"".  Also the Revival Series from the early 1991 with Ben Cross and Barbara Steele is much better.  If you want to see the best, just watch a couple of hours of the original series.  I've turned kids who are in their teens and twenties onto the original series.

In his treatment of Dark Shadows, it was too obvious that Barnabas Collins was a creature of the night and no mystery that he was a vampire.  Johnny's makeup from the get go was pasty white.  Johnny has always picked parts that are off color.  That is why I like him, but I was hoping he would have been a little more enigmatic with the character as Jonathan Frid was in the sixties TV soap opera.

THE MOVIE WITH JOHNNY DEPP BROUGHT BACK FUN MEMORIES OF THE SHOW.  DEPP SEEMS TO GET ANY CHARACTER HE PLAYS JUST RIGHT. IN THIS MOVIE PORTRAYING THE NASTY VAMPIRE BUT STILL SHOWING HIS LOVE FOR JOSETTE AND HIS FAMILY.  THE MOVIE HAD COMEDY IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOTS WITH A JUST AWAKENED VAMPIRE COMING BACK TO A NEW ERA.

Dark Shadows is not a great film, but if you enjoy Tim Burton films and all his wacky characters then this is a film you will find fun, very witty and just Tim Burtony. Johnny Depp, Michelle Phiepher and the rest of the cast deliver and Chloe Mortez along with Eva Green definitely shine in this one.

On the other hand we have a fantastic Eva Green. She, and the visuals, are the main attraction of this movie.
The FX, costumes and sets are brilliant, but in the end, there is nothing really new here.
So, in a way it is disappointing, but I like the movie nonetheless. Tim Burton proves again that he is the best living (visual) director.

4976246,2,B00683T5CW,"It is not the worst movie of the year, at least that much could be said for Tim Burton's Dark Shadows.  Fans of Burton's films pretty much know what to expect here:  an Elfman score that could have easily come from any other movie he scored; the screen-stealing presence of Johnny Depp; supporting actress Helena Bonham Carter (who wields a pretty decent American accent in this film); and gorgeous landscapes-oh, the landscapes and set designs are the best part of the film, as it usually goes for Burton.  Dark Shadows also boasts a respectable battery of supporting actors/actresses in Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz and Jackie Earle Haley.  The downside:  Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins is so utterly over the top and hammy that one wonders how he and Burton were ever allowed to get signed off to do this film; the script is about as imaginative as what you would expect a fusion of Dick and Jane and the Hardy Boys would result in, but to give it its due, what the plot lacks in originality (or even homage to the original) it more than makes up for with wild careening inconsistencies; the climax plods and the ending is about as hackneyed and as give the people what they want trite as you could ever hope for.  Please, please, PLEASE keep Burton away from remakes as he has f'ed up Sleepy Hollow, f'ed up Alice in Wonderland and royally f'ed up Willy Wonka.  Now Dark Shadows can be cast to that pile---would that it could be sealed in the coffin that Barnabas Collins was and sealed away for 200 years.",1358726400,5,1525,4.605166051660516

Even the actors were well cast and played their roles well. But about two thirds through, the whole film fell apart. The plot became totally senseless. Actors were no longer in character.

I really liked the original Dark Shadows series and films (I grew up with them).  But, I like how Depp portrays these period films or does period personalities, and I like Burton's humor.  So I took a DEEP sigh, mentaly adjusted and focused on the fact - that this is a re-vision of it all Via Depp/Burton....and I had to take it in as a wholly seperate film as if I'd never grown up with a DS history.  Once I got there, I love the film and what they did to toss-up the character salads and give them all an alternate flavor.

Burton clearly was making nods to the original show and the period, but trying to freshen it up. The CGI is minimal and subtle. Clearly this was s big budget movie with solid visuals. Burton sometimes overdoes the quirky weird. I know that is his thing, but sometimes a distraction.
Depp was well casted, I was watching Baranubus Collins, not Johnny Depp. The story at times veers of a little and appears lost. In the end the story does come full circle. So a solid Burton film overall.",1358208000,,746,4.1875

It does have a good plot, excellent acting and direction and the SFX are excellent (possibly the best I've seen).

4976280,3,B00683T5CW,"Although I was sucked in by the sheer, merry lunacy of this world, its characters and their wardrobe, there's really no excusing some of the faultlines that run through the heart of this confused little horror saga. It suffers from a severe case of subplot-itis, and tries in vain to cram four chapters' worth of back story into nearly every face. Even the less interesting minor players are obsessively over-inspected, which leads the more important characters to pull constant disappearing acts. Pseudo-protagonist Belle Heathcote is the most glaring example, vanishing without explanation for a full forty minutes during the second act, and then materializing right in the middle of a cramped romance. Johnny Depp's Barnabus is the one constant, happily sailing far over the top in yet another colorful, inexplicably successful leading turn. I caught myself laughing at the punchlines more often than I'd expected, but Dark Shadows often tests the boundaries of good taste, and in one case (an out-of-left-field comic love scene) ventures too close to the uncomfortably absurd. Kooky and silly, it's unforgivably (and thoroughly) lacking in the kind of panache Tim Burton was always known for.",1358121600,,1196,5.3

4976321,4,B00683T5CW,"Dark Shadows is an okay movie, especially if you haven't lost your affinity for Depp/ Burton. The atmosphere is rich and gothic, just what you'd want from this movie. However it dabbles a bit too much in soapy melodrama, and that pulls the overall rating down somewhat. The story lacks pace at times, but it's forgivable - all the interesting characters make up in that department.

On the technical side, though, this DVD follows the pattern Warner Home Video has been using on all their DVD releases recently: A not so polished transfer (edge enhancement is quite visible at times, and the black levels leaves you wanting), and then one bonus feature - it is the longest feature from the Blu-Ray, but even so, 7 minutes is not much.
In the audio department, you won't be disappointed - everything sounds like it should at this point.

Barnabas attends the concert by recommendation of his niece.  Alice sings ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and ""The Ballad of Dwight Fry"".  When Alice sings ""I gotta get outta here, I gotta get outta here, I gotta to get outta here"", that particular part of the song has a significant meaning in the movie.

So what if Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and the other makers took creative license?!  That's what makes this version interesting. Also, as a kid who ran home from the bus stop everyday to see the last ten minutes of each and every show, I was pleased that some of those loose ends were tied up with a bow in this version and poor, sad, lonely Barnabas finally had some justice and a  possible chance at happiness.  It also tickled me to see some of the original cast members from the original series given a chance to participate.  Some people may not 'get' this film, but lovers of the original series will.

The performances were uneven, with actors frequently forgetting their lines and searching for the que cards, but therein lay its charm because we got caught up in the quirky world of Barnabas Collins and Co.  Unfortunately, the reinterpretation in this movie was confused.  The trailers left us with the impression that this was going to be a campy comedy, and there are some cute moments thanks to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas, but it also tried to play out as a drama, and this is where it failed.  While I really didn't want to see Dark Shadows played for laughs, I think it would have been better to play up the melodrama and let the comedy come naturally.

All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but as far as I'm concerned, its real saving grace was Johnny Depp even if he wasn't at his best.",1357084800,,975,4.480225988700565

As a young man Barnabus rebuffed the advances of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and instead had fallen for Josette du Pres (Bella Heathcote), his soulmate. Feeling rejected by Barnabus, Angelique kills his parents, casts a spell that everyone he loves will die (including Josette who had jumped off a cliff to her death), and cursed Barnabus to be a vampire so he could live with his misery for all eternity. Angelique turned the town against Barnabus whom she has buried in a coffin where he stayed for centuries. Until one day he was discovered by construction workers and awakened.

Now back home he has been introduced to his relatives Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard (Michelle Pfieffer), her daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller), and his son David Collins (Gulliver McGrath). Also residing at Collinwood are Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) the live in psychiatrist, & Willie Loomis (Jackie Earl Haley) Barnabus' servant & caretaker of the manor. The newest addition is Victoria Winters ne Maggie Evans (Bella Heathcote), David's new governess, to whom Barnabus takes an instant liking.

Tim Burton's more modern take on the basic story from the soap opera (which has changed very little) is quite satisfying. Johnny Depp's Barnabas Collins is hilarious, but still a very sympathetic character. His need to kill seems a sad, little foible. I found myself dismayed and amused by my lack of sympathy for his victims. Sorry, Tim, but I found the only disappointing casting decision (or character concept) to be your usually note perfect spouse, Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman, She was frequently humorous, but totally unconvincing.

Eve Green was spot on as the evil Angelique, who was always my fav in the original show. She's more beautiful as a brunette, but just as talented as a blonde.

I just wish there were a commentary with Tim & Johnny. Since I'm not getting it, I'll throw in Danny Elfman, who did his usual marvelous job on the score.",1356998400,,929,4.652439024390244

I swore I wouldn't see this dreck, but eventually caved just to see the train wreck Burton made ... only to NOT hate it as much as I thought, but also (thankfully) to find out that the film is NOT a comedy (and should not have been marketed as such by the studio). There are comedic touches and a black comedy overtone to the film, at times, to be sure - but in general, the story of a centuries-old vampire named Barnabas Collins (Depp), who is released from his coffin prison to walk among the living (and his ancestral home) again, is a tongue-in-cheek drama that is generally just not a good film ... but also not the piece of crap I thought it to be.

My wife bought it for me for Christmas, and when we saw that it was PG13, we decided to preview it before showing the kids. Good thing we did.

The reviews said it was ""hysterical."" I found nothing in it funny at all. One scene implied oral sex on Barnaby Collins the vampire. Not only is that uncool, but downright creepy--he's undead! Do I need to explain how...yucky that is?!

Another scene, my wife and I zipped over was when vampire and witch...um...tear up the place. Not funny. Not entertaining. Not good.

This was supposed to be dark humor. Nope. Just pathetic. Every single person in the drama. In the end, you feel sorry for only one person, Mrs. Collins, and she's nasty. When someone complained to her that Barnaby is killing/eating people, she says that he's family and is bringing the business back. Wow. Now that's deep.

No sympathetic characters (with the trifle exception of Mrs. Collins). Everyplace you'd expect some kind of development or moral evaluation never materializes (think of Alice in Wonderland's Hatter when Depp realizes that to Alice he was just fantasy).

And from where I sat in the theatre (and I do not go to the movies very often - I even saw this at the midnight show on opening day- that's how much I wanted to see it), it was a movie that made me go ""oh wow.""  The actors  - first rate.  The story - first rate.  The visuals - first rate.  The music - first rate.

I, for one, hope they do another and make this a series - much akin to the Pirates series (but not getting as weak as that series did at the end).

The only regret that I have about it is I was hoping the actors from the original series (who made a brief appearance at the party) would have been given a larger role - especially Jonathan Frid.

But go ahead - get this and while you are at it purchase House of Dark Shadows and do a double feature.  Heck, get Night of Dark Shadows and make it a triple feature.",1356739200,,1065,3.8036529680365296

4976488,5,B00683T5CW,"The original ""Dark Shadows"" serial went off the air when I was eight so I have vague recall.  I remember my older sister going out for Halloween as Angelique one year.  As a Burton-Depp fan I was awaiting this version with baited breath.  A couple months before the film came out the devotees of the series went on the offensive imploring people not to see it because Burton et al made a ""comedy"".  My buddy, who was a long time fan and even liked the Ben Cross reboot, hated the film.  These dual forces persuaded me not to see it in a theatre and apparently others followed suit because it was a box office underperformer.  Finally seeing the film on home video I can state emphatically to the fanboys, ""Are you mad?  Have you even seen the movie?""  ""Dark Shadows"" is terrific.  For those who say that Burton made a comedy for sure there are comedic elements but for the most part the narrative is played straight.  Johnny Depp continues to amaze with his mesmerizing account of reluctant vampire Barnabas Collins.  Clad in black with a pale visage Depp projects an austere courtliness even if his underlying motive is to drink your blood.  Eva Green is equally terrific as the devilish Angelique, a seductive witch who could tempt the purest of heart to the dark side.  The script is full of wit and memorably macabre throwaway lines.  The art direction is nothing short of stupendous.  Aside from Danny Elfman's usual sterling score Burton populates the soundtrack with some delicious vintage chestnuts.  I had chills running down my spine as a straightjacketed Alice Cooper sang ""The Ballad of Dwight Fry"" at a Collins family ball.  Afficienadoes of the original series may quibble with some of the liberties Burton has taken.  As one of the uninitiated I thought it was a gas.  If anything came out of this I bought ""House of Dark Shadows"" and ""Night of Dark Shadows"" because Burton's film piqued my interest in Dan Curtis' original creation.",1356307200,2,1948,4.710059171597633

4976496,3,B00683T5CW,"I have heard that this movie was based on a popular soap-opera TV show in the years before I was born, but this movie is actually pretty good for its contemporaries. While it may not endure as a classic, the beautiful images, scenery, witty writing style, costumes, and music--have made this movie a little unique on its own. The movie's story is definitely centered on Barnabas, with the rest of the (Collins) family members as his supporting cast. I was actually thinking of a comedy with Gothic scenery before watching this movie; so, I was a bit more amused when it was slowly turning into a gangster-style movie. There were lots of poetic moments (e.g.) a strong, ambitious and determined woman as its villain) and satirical dialogue writing, but it was sort of a letdown when some of ""twists"" towards the end were revealed in order to ""finish"" the movie. I thought that the storytellers had probably tried to cram as many characteristics from the source material as much as they could, but it didn't effectively work out because the movie has been about Barnabas and his arch-enemy Angelique since its beginning. I had mixed feelings at the end because I felt really sorry for its villain and the family whom she had tried to destroy for two centuries. Sadly, the planned mixture of comedy and serious elements of power-play (and especially that out-of-this-world character revelation towards the end) just didn't blend well for its ""blood is thicker than water"" message (sorry for the intended pun).

On the other hand, I feel so blessed with this holiday with another of Amazon.com's exceptional service. Not only I have received a free (limited) access of the streaming movie version, but I also received the package a lot sooner than expected. The expected delivery date was sometime after Christmas day; so, imagine the surprise and joy when it arrived to my doorstep before the aforementioned special day.

4976497,1,B00683T5CW,"When the reviews for the film came out and described it as a farce, I vowed never to see it.  I am a DS purist, in fact, I own the entire series, all 26 volumes.  I loved it as a boy, running home to see it twice, once at 3:30 and another at 4:00.  The show was escapism at its best, especially for a primary school kid.

I loved all of the original actors in their varied roles.  No one, not even Depp, whom I consider the best actor on the planet since Pirates 1.  He did a good job in what was asked of him, but he's no Jonathan Frid.  And Angelique?  I don't even know the blonde's name who played her here but there is no woman on this Earth better that bringing Angelique to life than Lara Parker.  The question asked on the boys of my generation is this:  Ginger or Mary Ann?  I say that question is incomplete.  Throw Angelique in that mix and, to me, the answer would be a hands-down Angelique.  Lara Parker is one of the most beautiful daytime actresses I have ever seen, enough so to jolt the heart of a seven year old boy!!

I guess I am the purest among purists but I was disappointed that this movie didn't stay true to the original ""intent"" of the series.  The first movie, The House of Dark Shadows, was really just a jazzed up version of events we had already seen in the series, we'd seen it all before, but it took some of the blood and gore to higher levels. It was exciting and fun!  Even a 2012 remake of that, with a few tweeks, would have been ok.

I guess I am nostalgic for the old days, but this movie did not do it for me.  With a $100 million plus budget and todays special effects, the write story line could have been the scariest thrill ride in the last decade.  The result, old purists like me would have been talking about it non-stop and legions of new fans would have come on board.

Talk about the making of a new film franchise? This could have been the next monster, pardon my pun.

And my mood for this review isn't helped by the fact that Jonathan Frid died earlier this year.  So, for the little kids who grew into adulthood, one of the special memories of our television childhood, Barnabus Collins, is gone.

I could say the same about Andy Griffith, too, but that is for another review.

I'm still a fan of the serial, but if you're looking for the afternoon ""soap opera"", well this wouldn't be your cup of tea.

I did get a kick out of watching the Carpenters singing in a vampire movie, talk about ironic! If the rest of the family could have been as interesting as Depp's character, it might have been a good movie, but the way it came out, it looked like the producers got tired and lost after his introduction to his modern relatives and they just didn't know what to do with the storyline afterwards.

I have to admit that I never watched the original ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-1971), as I spent decades ignoring soap operas and most weekly serial entertainment programs with the exception of a few classics. However even though I keep saying I do not like the Jonny Depth sort of film I find that I strangely enough purchased just about all of them. After watching ""Dark Shadows"" I guess I will just have to admit that I do like his body of work. Turns out it is a lot of Burton's films with which I am not enamored.

Just in case I am not the only person to have missed the original story line, this film is about the head of a household ""Collinwood"" or more of a financial empire that returns to a crumbling future to rebuild that empire.

In his youthful lusty way Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) besmirches a young which Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and soon must turn to the dark side to protect himself and the new love of his life. It is to no avail as he is transformed into a vampire and force to covet his neighbor's blood. He is boxed for a couple hundred years and on his return he now must cope with a new world and his reencounter with his gorgeous lustful nemesis.

This looks like it is probably a pilot to a new series of films similar to his previous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series.

Now I want the sound track. I have most of the songs now but it is a nice mixture and will remind me of the movie.

4976580,1,B00683T5CW,"Dark Shadows, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, was a weak soap opera show of the late sixties/early seventies.  It had its moments but was basically over-acted, low budget and full of fluff.

It shows the utter desperation of Hollywood that anyone would consider this show to be worthy of a reboot.  The film most horrific moment is when you realize that you've just wasted almost two hours of your life that you will never get back.

This film has NOTHING going for it.  Johnny Depp overwhelms the entire cast who seem to be little more than ghosts in their roles.  This point is especially clear when you realize that the great romance of this film revolves around Barnaby (Johnny Depp) and the governess who has about three minutes of screen time.  At the end of the film, we are supposed to feel something for this tragic couple but I'm not sure why.

The plot is so pointless that the viewer is subjected to good chunks of time when nothing but mayhem is going on.  I don't mean anything exciting just things getting broken, burning, flying around - whatever.

The antagonist is about the only character who has any fire to her.  She has this incredible, unlimited power to effect the world around her and apparently only has the vision to 1.) stalk a boring vampire and 2.) take over the fishing industry.  Wow, that pretty much says it all.

This is one of the most miserable wastes of time that anyone could endure and I encourage viewers to run from it.  The Tim Burton-Johnny Depp-Danny Elfman+++ crew need to move onto new projects, preferably something in another industry.",1355184000,,1598,4.620567375886525

Whole parts of the story line just don't make sense. Admittedly, there are a few well delivered lines that will make you chuckle (with Johnny Depp, how could you expect otherwise), but over all, as said in the header of the review, the best parts were in the previews.

A pity for Depp -- at times he can be a great actor. I pretty much knew all this from watching the trailers, but my family wanted to see it so I caved in and watched it.

4976622,5,B00683T5CW,"Rather than simply remake an instant re-play of the highly favored TV show, Dark Shadows, Tim Burton artfully casts the irresistible Johnny Depp as an alluring (except when he bites) sympathetic Barnabas who looks for love & a recovered identity in all the wrong places.

In Burton's version, only Barnabas displays human inclinations of remorse, empathy, and unconditional love as he is juxtaposed against dysfunctional (perfectly stereotypical) 1970's characters.

Some die-hard Dark Shadows fans were gravely disappointed, as they craved a re-creation of the TV show.  I, too, am a faithful 'Shadows' fan, and absolutely enjoyed the excellent casting and humorous directing in Burton's film.  He presents great on-screen caricatures of the fine actors who brought (TV) Dark Shadows to life by poking fun at their nuances but keeping the drama afloat.

Viewers who came of age in the 1970's (when American youth were desperately trying to carve out an identity separate from reality), will appreciate Burton's satirical trip back in time.  Moving quickly, he combines bizarre characters, unrequited love, The Moody Blues, a resonating Karen Carpenter, and Alice Cooper's rock angst - alongside scenes such as a newly resurrected aristocratic Barnabas staring at a lonely unappetizing frozen waffle, and an exhausted Barnabas perched in drapery yearning for sleep (his coffin was blown up).

Obviously, Burton's Dark Shadows was not meant to be a generic sequel to the infamous TV show, nor was it was designed to be ""Shakespearean"" (on the other hand, Shakespeare's groundlings would probably have loved it).

So, if you like Johnny Depp (WHO NEVER DISAPPOINTS) and harmless satire, then you'll enjoy the movie; it's a great chance to join in the fun the actors must have had when making it!

4976633,2,B00683T5CW,"I don't know much about the TV Show. To me, it's like ""The Addams Family"" or what-have-you. A program about a family of monsters or strange characters. All I know is that when you hear that The tag-team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will make a film version of that popular TV show, you immediately find that it's a given. You become excited. You think of the usual gothic-like set decorations of Burton's movies, you think of his usual eerie-yet-fantasy-like-music made by his friend Danny Elfman, you think about his excellent actress-of-a-wife (Helena Bonham-Carter) that you know we'll be in it somewhere, you also think about the superb cast of well-known actors and actresses that you know wil grace the screen, Well, you think of all that and you're bound to have great expectations for this cinematic proposition.  And then, you even hear that Alice Cooper, the legendary morbid and funny singer will have a cameo. How can you not have a great time? How can they mess it up?

Well, they didn't mess it up. Not exactly. But you think... all this for... that? For what, exactly? What was the goal? This movie is spectacular. It's well acted. Everything that dress it up is excellent. But what's inside? What was the point? At the level where Tim Burton is, after making a great film like ""Big Fish"", I would have expected something deeper with this ""Dark Shadows"". A second and a third layer to the story. A metaphor for something else. Like ""The Shining"" by the late Stanley Kubrick.

Roger Ebert, the great critic, summed it up well: ""All dressed up but nowhere to go"". We have a great intro, not classic, but great nonetheless. Then, we follow for a good twenty minute the new and young governess, how she is introduced to the strange family and what will be her goal. Then we forget about her and she becomes a secondary character! The problems continue: you don't quite get the bizarre attraction that the witch (Eva Green) has for Depp's character, you only learn about the true nature of the daughter at about... 15 minutes until the end of the film, the father has nothing interesting to offer to the plot, the mother seems to simply stand on top of the stairs all day long, the witch simply tells the sheriff at the end that the strange family is responsible for the explosion of a warehouse and he believes her right away with only a tape recorder as proof (no she didn't use any hypnotic power), then the cops and the whole village hunts the family down, surround the Mansion and... suddenly disappear (even the cops!) even if the whole house is on fire with an epic battle of supernatural beings inside of it...

All of this, plus the fact that they misused Alice Cooper (who seemed to have been set up for a bigger role), well of this makes me think that Burton simply went through the robotic moves of storytelling. The characters do this and that because they need to do it and that's it. Because the story demands it. The movie seemed to want to go somewhere and then, the same movie seemed to had forgotten about its purpose and simply went on automatic. When it ends, you're left disappointed.  Something is missing. A direction. A vision. A goal for all of this. Simply relying on the talent of Johnny Depp is not enough. The film is constantly flirting with greatness but always misses it. It's a very disappointing offering by a great director. It's not a disaster, mind you. Simply, it's irrelevant.

Maybe that's worse.",1354665600,4,3448,4.625816993464053

4976635,4,B00683T5CW,I have a large amount of respect for Johnny Depp. He leads the cast down a dark but fun romp through the mists. He guides his dysfunctional descendants to the path of recovery and reminds them what it means to be a loving caring family no matter your faults.,1354665600,,258,4.285714285714286
4976636,3,B00683T5CW,"From direction and production to the story-line, itself, I believed sub par. The characters, themselves, even lacked certain character... However, having said that, you must understand I am a HUGE critic.. And, when I am to ascertain the idea of a movie, with the likes of Johnny Depp - who I believe to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, of any and all other actors(to say the least) - I expect that movie to be one, of two, things:  A Blockbuster,  or,  mine-blowing!!  So, it is QUITE POSSIBLE that I an being to harsh.... But, always keep in mind, no matter what else, a movie is always a ""Must See"" if it is starring JOHNNY DEPP!!!!",1354665600,3,639,4.34453781512605

Don't skip out or you will need to rewind to catch up on a detail that is important to what is occurring.  Overall a pretty good movie and worth the money.  Tim Burton, as always, does a fine job capturing the darker aspects of the situation and building the drama to it's conclusive ending.",1354665600,,433,4.512820512820513

I kept looking at the actress who played the witch and kept thinking ""I know her from something"", and sure enough, she was Bond's love interest in Casino Royale. Ha! Overall Dark Shadows was entertaining enough. You will probably like it if you are a Johnny Depp and/or a Tim Burton fan.",1354665600,,373,4.5

4976646,3,B00683T5CW,"I personally liked the original TV series better than this film and the Revival TV series in the 1990's decade starring Ben Cross.  Although I feel that Johnny Depp did a better job than Ben Cross in playing the role of Barnabas, I still feel that Jonathan Frid on the original TV series was the best of all.  Jonathan Frid played the role of Barnabas so well that I don't feel that he could ever be surpassed by any other actors.  There were some differences in this film compared to the original series such as Barnabas telling Elizabeth Collins Stoddard his secret which he didn't tell Elizabeth in the original TV series.  Some of the photography in this film was good and modernized.  As one other reviewer said, the original TV series in the 1960's was a success because of the conversations and dialogues taking place between the characters.  I feel that the original TV series can never be surpassed because of its own uniqueness.",1354579200,2,938,4.654545454545454
4976647,5,B00683T5CW,I have enjoyed all of Johnny Depp's movies. I haven't found another actor that can change characters so often and still shine with natural talents.,1354579200,,147,4.92
4976648,5,B00683T5CW,"This movie is another hit of Johnny Depp. He plays his heart out and will not let you down. When he plays , his sole is in it. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Dark Shadows and of Johnny Depp.",1354579200,,208,3.6444444444444444
4976649,4,B00683T5CW,I enjoyed this film even if this was not one of the classic burton/depp collaboration's. The set designs were awesome and the make-up effects were a good throwback to classic horror films.,1354579200,,188,4.90625
4976650,1,B00683T5CW,"The first ten minutes or so of this movie that are set in the 18th century do manage to create some atmosphere.  From there it all goes downhill.  This movie is worse than I imagined it would be.  The humor in it is for the most part dumb and the storyline is lame.  For much of the movie it seems like the plot is centered around the rivalry between two fish canneries. Supposedly Tim Burton is a fan of the original show but it sure isn't evident in the way he parodies the characters. The writing is sloppy, one character out of nowhere is revealed in the last 10 minutes to have been a werewolf all along. It comes way out of left field and makes no sense. I found most of this movie boring and uninteresting.  A good cast completely wasted.",1354579200,,745,4.21830985915493

4976652,4,B00683T5CW,Another great performance by Johnny Depp.  Included Depp's humor.  The story line was great and would recommended to my friends.,1354579200,,128,5.35

4976657,4,B00683T5CW,"Since I grew up watching the original series, I was a bit reluctant to even watch this modern version, but have to admit, it wasn't a bad effort at all. I don't think it will ever become the icon that the series has, but it's quirky, interesting and funny at times, and Johnny Depp has proven once again that there really isn't any role that he can't do well. It was definitely worth watching - I enjoyed it!",1354579200,,408,4.243589743589744

4976662,5,B00683T5CW,"I was very dissapointed with the reviews from the media about this movie, in the US and in my country, Argentina. I do not know if the critics are narrow minded or they just don't get the magic that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp create together, in every movie they've made, some better than other but all of them just wonderful.
In my opinion, as a fan and follower of Burton since I was 13 years old (I'm 35 now), Dark Shadows is the most ""Burtonian"" movie since ""Mars attacks"", full of that scent of satire and black humor that I loved in ""Mars"". But now it's even better because we have the mixture of Burton + Depp. These two guys were meant for each other (with respect to their wives).
I went to see it with a friend who is a fan of Johnny, but she doesn't really get the ""Burton"" style. She did not like it. It was a shame I went with her jjaa. That first time I like it and I gave it an 8 in my scale, but the second time I saw it, now in blu-ray, I liked it even more. Last week I saw it again with one of my students and my Mom. Both of them loved it. Case closed: media critics know nothing! It's the most ""Burtonian"" and personal movie since ""Big Fish"". Between then until Dark Shadows, Tim devoted his time to more commercial films, not that I did not enjoy them, but I prefer more of this kind of work.
The cast is superb as always. Also, he hires the same actors again. Thanks God, he hired Michelle for this one. After her masterpiece work as Catwoman, I was wondering why Tim waited 20 years to call her back for a role. She's one of the greatest actresses of all time. And for Depp, I wonder what weird role he still has ahead; I think he's done almost everything. The Acadamy should give up and give him an Oscar before he's too old to hold it!!!",1354492800,,1763,4.083573487031701

4976667,4,B00683T5CW,"Lets face it, Dark Shadows (the original soap opera) was a campy little oddity from 60s/70s day-time television. Nobody really expects much from it. This remake has much better production values (how could it not?) but the writers for the remake have actually come up with a very enjoyable tail about characters that you come to truly care about by the end of the movie. Treat yourself and give it a spin.",1354492800,,405,4.638888888888889

4976685,5,B00683T5CW,"I love this dvd and have watched it several times since receiving it.  Johnny Depp's wry sense of humor, facial expressions and accent are perfect for the role of Barnabas Collins.  Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a great performance as the matriarch of the Collins clan.  Helena Bonham Carter is a trip as the alcoholic psychiatrist!  The rest of the cast are equally adept at playing their roles as well.  The soundtrack is great, including my favorite, Night's In White Satin by the Moody Blues and the appearance by Alice Cooper is wild!  The visual effects are stunning and eerie and add to the enjoyment of the film.  Love this film more each time I watch it and am happy to have it in my collection.",1354320000,,701,4.56

4976706,3,B00683T5CW,"This movie had a brilliant idea which it did not execute properly. I realize its based on an old tv show that most have never seen but that should have been a good thing.

For one, why did it take place in the 1970s?  That is not interesting at all. It should have taken place in modern times or at least it should have played around with the time and culture change some more.  Second, there was no consistent tone and too many plot holes.

For example, where did Barnaba's descendants come from if he had no children and no obvious brothers or sisters? Also why did he kill those innocent hippies if he was getting blood transfusions? Furthermore why is the fact that he keeps banging Angelique never surface in the eyes of his girlfriend?

The plot was full of potential but the outcome was boring. The only highlights of the film were the always pleasurable Eva Green and Johnny Depps characters. The rest were average but underdeveloped. I'm shocked at how little screen time the character of Victoria got. She was a big part of the plot.

I'm glad I rented this movie and that I saw it. It's by no means horrible, the visuals are excellent, Tim Burton's style is always a welcome. I just wish it had more depth and a lot more going on. A sequel is teased at the end and I for one would welcome one if the plot was interesting.",1354060800,2,1332,4.350806451612903

I was a fan of the original 'TV Soap' that held us all glued to our TV's back in the 60's and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this updated version.  Johnny does the role of Barnabas Collins with a flare that's impossible to resist!

4976711,3,B00683T5CW,Of course I have never seen the original show so i can really only base the story line off the movie. The story line was ok but at points you felt like it was going no where and pretty much everything that happened you expected it to happen. Johny Depp you would expect to have a great preference in the movie but he just gives a so so preference in the movie. There are random scenes in the movie it seems like they just threw in to add to the length of the movie and has nothing to do with the plot line.

4976716,4,B00683T5CW,"When it comes to the world of Sparkly Vampires that walk about in the day time a fellow like me just wants to Trash a Wal-Mart every time the names Bella or Edward are mentioned.
When remembering the Vampires of my youth I often fantasize about Lestat stalking a tender teen into an alley and just as he's about to put the ""BITE"" on she says ""But your not SPARKLEY"".
. Which brings me to Dark Shadows. As a child I would peddle my bike home after school to watch the daily adventures of Barnabas, Victoria and The Collins Clan and years later watched every episode of the NBC Prime time reboot so needless to say I was looking forward to the Tim Burton spin. This where my problems lies. I loved it. However I am not sure weather I loved it because it was a good movie or that I was so caught up in the idea of a Dark Shadows for the 21st century and I could not be objective. For that reason I could not give Dark Shadows 5 stars. That being said I loved the casting Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, Michelle Pfeiffer  and Eva Green give extremely entertaining performances, I can't say brilliant ( Get real we're talking about a Vampire Movie) although there is something about watching Depp and Haley they bring always bring wonderful nuance to all of their roles. Now don't look for a Jonathan Frid 1960's gothic soap style because this Film does not have it. The difference between Dan Curtis and Tim Burton is Quantum and the ""Dark Shadows"" is definitely Burton's UNIVERSE with all the quirky twists we have come to expect from him. However none of the flashes of brilliance you might get from an ""Edward Scissorhands"" instead the watcher is left with the nagging impression that the ""Dark Shadows"" project  was a much wanted toy that Misters Burton and Depp wanted to have but then got bored with. From the Box Office Response I am guessing I was not the only one who got that impression.  I wanted this film to start a wave of ""Barnabas Mania"". It didn't. There was enough to keep an old die hard fan like me engaged but for those with a backlog of memories The film may fall short of expectations and for those unfamilier they may not get it. In short Dark Shadows is flawed but like a cinimatic equivalant of a Reeces Peanut butter cup  not memorable, not gourmet but really enjoyable while you are consuming it.",1353974400,,2337,4.427906976744186

4976719,4,B00683T5CW,I did not like the tv show.  A dull soap opera with cheaply done spooky sets.  I dismissed this movie when it was in theaters.  The trailer fails miserably.  Because I am a Johnny Depp fan I rented it when I was bored and it was cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I expected a shiny lump of coal but found a nearly discarded gem of a movie.  The cast is top notch and the sets and cgi are indistinguishable from reality.  They somehow kept the theme and backstory but replaced the stupid soap opera core with an uplifting and fun resurrection of family and personal integrity plot.  You come to care about barnabas and his family by the end.,1353974400,,643,4.336134453781512

Not too familiar with the original TV series, but this one seemed to follow the teleplay lead.  Michelle Phifer was hot and the other characters were fairly silly.  I felt an eerie sense of mortality at the end.  It worked for me as I watched it around Halloween, so maybe it is a seasonal thing?",1353888000,,457,4.206896551724138

Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in some time -- we gave it over an hour and could not stand to watch any more of it. It's spooky, but too dull to make it thrilling, and the humor was nothing but a few poor attempts to get a chuckle from the audience. Depp is usually able to disappear into a role, but here I felt like he was just playing dress-up as a vampire. The Depp-Burton combo failed on this one.",1353888000,,737,4.089655172413793

I, like Johnny Depp, would run home from school and watch Dark Shadows.  I loved it because it was unique.  Let's face it, TV in the 70's was terrible and Dark Shadows, even though they considered it a soap, was refreshing.  All the actors do an excellent job and the movie is hilarious!  The only way they could have pulled it off was making it a comedy and the only people who could pull that off are Burton and Depp.  I loved the music throughout the movie so much that I immediately bought the soundtrack.  My kids never saw Dark Shadows and they both loved this movie.  I don't think it would have worked if they had done a serious, soapy type movie.  It would have been just another Twilight.  Who needs another Twilight!  If you grew up in the 70's, you will love the way they poked fun of that time.  It was like going down memory lane.  One of my favorite scenes is with Alice Cooper.  I love Alice Cooper and he has a great sense of humor.  They also left it open for a second film.  I hope they do another one soon!  I highly recommend this movie.",1353715200,,1224,4.202586206896552

4976793,4,B00683T5CW,"Quick, which film features a child with uncertain heritage stewarded by vampires and werewolves and a war between two supernatural factions over a family's choice?  Before there was ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn,"" there was ""Dark Shadows.""

Instead of Edward we have Barnabas (Johnny Depp, vamping it up), an old-school vampire in love with a pretty young thing who is played by an actress named Bella Heathcote (playing Josette du Pres).  It seems Barnabas made the mistake of having an affair with the family's maid, Angelique Buouchard (Eva Green) who also happens to be a witch.  She uses witchcraft to push Josette to suicide and curses Barnabas with vampirism.

Fast forward to the 1970s and Barnabas is unearthed, returning to his ancestral home to reclaim his legacy.  But that legacy is in tatters: matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) lives with her ne'er-do-well brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), his 10-year-old spooky son David (Guilliver McGrath), Elizabeth's oversexed teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), and a handful of staff consisting of Caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), David's psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), and David's new governess Victoria Winters (also played by Bella). David, it seems, believes he can talk to ghosts. It's not a happy place.

Barnabas' return leads to the discovery to two startling facts: Angelique is an immortal with an iron grip on the town and Victoria is the reincarnation of Josette.  Torn between the two women, Barnabas plans to return his family to its former glory while fending off his own bloody thirst for women and blood.  It's enough to make a vampire blush.

The trailers for ""Dark Shadows"" gave the appearance of a comedy, which likely set critics' expectations for an entirely different film.  But this is a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration that is alternately macabre and humorous - tonally it's no different from any of the other movies they've produced.  The difference is they're playing in someone else's sandbox.  ""Dark Shadows"" has a long legacy compressed in to just a few hours.

""Dark Shadows"" is entertaining as the anti-vampire movie - Barnabas frequently walks around with blood trailing down the corners of his mouth - but it has a lot of ground to cover.  Some characters are more fleshed out and relevant than others, leaving Roger a caricature, Carolyn a brooding teen stereotype, and Julia yet another quirky wisp of a personality.  There's enough here that it could easily be fleshed out into a soap opera...which means the film is faithful to its source material.

A soap opera about vampires, ghosts, and werewolves?  As ""Tru Blood,"" ""The Vampire Diaries,"" and ""Being Human,"" have demonstrated, ""Dark Shadows"" was ahead of its time.",1353715200,3,2777,5.202247191011236

4976795,5,B00683T5CW,"The original show was a very mundane show.  It took Willy Lomas three days to get Barnabus Collins out of his coffin and another episode to introduce the character.  People talk about Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks, Al Pacino, or Robert Dinero, Peter Sellers as possibilities for the best actor of all time without considering Johnny Depp, and for him not to be on that list because he hasn't been around forever is just nuts.

Depp, as always, is a pleasure to watch, the supporting cast is entertaining as well, but it just can't make up for the unevenness of the movie's tone.

4976854,4,B00683T5CW,"A terrific movie for an average couch-ridden night.  A few laughs? Sure! The ever-striking Johnny Depp? Absolutely! Yet, a couple of plot inconsistencies bothered me... (except, that they were not inconsistencies, but very intentional Burtonisms) SPOILER ALERT!

First, why did the ghost of Josette appear to Vicky after Barnabas' arrival?  So, she said he's coming, he did, good!  Ghost, go to the light, but nooo - she kept on appearing and saying ""help me"" and throwing herself off that splendid chandelier over and over again, yet that story line leads nowhere... Vicky doesn't help her in any way and the ghost is nowhere to be seen at the end.

Second, why does Vicky walk off the cliff after the witch has died?  The curse should have been lifted, by all fairytale standards; it just doesn't make any sense.  Alas, this is a Tim Burton movie, and the darkness that permeates it is above and beyond anything you should expect from a mediocre Hollywood picture show.

It dawned on me - this subtle and, I dare say, dysfunctional, obsession with the macabre and death, that Mr. Burton harbors, has found an interesting way of expressing itself - Josette is telling Vicky to throw herself off the cliff throughout the film in order for Vicky to gain the everlasting union with Barnabas (there is no curse, Vicky jumps of her own volition, is about to die, and just like she planned - he turns her into an immortal, blood sucking monster, weird kissing of the undead ensues).  Well, my mind is boggled, Mr. Burton, disturbingly but nicely played!

Also, having Josette and Vicky mastered by the same actress blew my mind, I did not even realize they were played by the same person at first.

The music from the series is iconic, but there was not a single refrain in the score.  Over the past 50 years Bond films, while being updated, retain something of the original.

Perhaps saddest part of all is: this disaster of a movie will likely sink forever the possibility of a ""true"" Dark Shadows picture...for fans of the old series (I rushed home every day from school to watch!) that is truly tragic.

4976906,4,B00683T5CW,"With so many thorough and spot-on reviews here, I will just toss out the following:

- I grew up on the TV series, and though glossy and modern, this is a fitting tribute.
- Depp is his usual, scenery-chewing, glorious self -- a character actor of the highest order.
- Getting past the fact that Tim Burton cannot make a movie these days without his own wife (Helena Bonham Carter), Johnny Depp, and one or both of them wearing a red wig, this is much more in the groove of his older, classic films.
- Having worked off-Broadway with the original Angelique, Lara Parker, I spent the whole movie looking for her cameo; I never spotted her. Apparently, less cameo, more ballyhooed background work.
- This is DARK. If you were led by the trailer to expect a comedy, you are not going to find it here. BUT, it is darkly comic and there is a general mood of frivolity and levity; it is not a heavy drama.
- This is not for the kids. Though there's nothing showing that should be covered by a bathing suit, there is one particular sexual situation that is beyond saucy and rough, and there's plenty of blood -- though being a hater of the gore genre, it wasn't so heavy as to make me uncomfortable. It's more staged than realistic.
- Overall, a well spent couple of bucks and couple of hours.",1352678400,2,1286,4.380753138075314

Oh did and I forget to mention the rather hot and hilarious love seen!! Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, you can not go wrong.
Getting my movies in the combo pack, it allows everyone in the family be able to watch the movie.

Certainly there are funny moments, but the cast mainly plays it straight. There are multiple plot lines started, seemingly forgotten for awhile, and then brought back in at the end. In the end it's another one of those if-you-watched-the-trailer-you've-seen-the-best-bits movies.

witty charming and very moving in places this is not your standard comedy nor is it classic horror it is  however a nice classy blend of both.
The gore isn't there which was pleasantly surprising, but the arcane sense of humor he throws into his character is refreshing and sexy .
Don't expect just simple humor, true you will find it sprinkled here and there , but over all this is a dark film about survival and the nature of the beast that lives in all of us.

I'm sixty six years old, I've seen the original Dark Shadows on t.v. and I've seen other versions of Dark Shadows but I really liked Johnny's  version because it was done in a tongue-in-cheek humourous style and I got a kick out of that. I mean the seventies music, Johnny's Beatle's hair style, all of it was great. The big party happening bash he gives with Alice Cooper alone was a hoot. And Johnny did give a lovely hommage to the original Barnabas Collins actor Jonathan Frid and other original cast members, by having them be the first party guests to arrive. Johnny is always challenging himself as an actor, that's what I like about him. No other leading actor takes on so many different roles like he does. I'm looking forward to seeing him portray Tonto next on the big screen.

4976960,2,B00683T5CW,"As a grade school kid many years ago, I used to rush home after class to watch the original Dark Shadows soap opera each day.  So, as you might expect, when I heard about the upcoming release for the theatrical version of Dark Shadows, I was curious to see what the film treatment for this TV classic would be like.

In general, what I thought I would get from this movie was a light-hearted take on the TV show and I was okay with that.  I say this because the ""spooky, horror"" genre just doesn't appeal to me like it did when I was a kid.  In watching the trailers for this film, I was led to believe that I would actually be watching a satire of a TV classic with some updates added to make it a bit more contemporary.  What I think I saw was a film in which the direction it wanted to take (remake, satire,comedy, or horror) was not evidently clear and I thus felt cheated after spending about two hours watching a film which fell far short of expectations.

The story line for the film seemed to change mid-course and seemed fragmented in these transitions.  Some parts also seemed too predictable to keep me interested.  Granted, I did have a few chuckles at a couple of points in the film.  However, those laughs were not worth the nearly two hours of agony I spent hoping the story would get more interesting and thus better.

The experience of watching Dark Shadows left me with the belief that all of the interesting parts of the movie were shown in the TV commercials for the film. Sadly, this seems to be the case with a lot of movies these days....",1352073600,,1561,4.315068493150685

4976964,2,B00683T5CW,"Saw the previews for Dark Shadows when it was in the theaters and thought it would be funny and enjoyable to watch.  Didn't plan on seeing it in the theater and opted to either rent it or stream it.  Definitely glad I didn't waste my money on it in the theater and regret spending the $3.99 to stream it.  Not even sure I would be happy to have spent $1.00 at Redbox on it.

Based on the previews I was expecting a comedy.  While there were a few lines that I didn't see in the previews it definitely wasn't a comedy.  It wasn't even frightening.  Honestly don't know what to call it except boring.  I am reminded of a Brad Paisley video where Shatner comments after Brad questions what he (Shatner) thought of the video.  Shatner said ""I liked the end... when the music stopped."".  Well I never have seen a movie where I was glad to see the credits.  Sadly I had to wake myself up a little just to realize the movie had ended.  I would call it the sleeper hit of 2012... literally.",1352073600,,982,4.220430107526882

overall Depp has enough of a command of the character to carry this movie. There is just too much background, family history and missing character development to try to pack into one movie. Critical plot points are glossed over, missing or not fleshed out enough for us to to really get involved with Barnabas, Roger Collins, Carolyn and David the way we should.
I love the porcelain doll effects on Angelique - totally amazing. I also love the Liverpool segments in the beginning.

Of course the acting was good, Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter are always great - especially together - and that new witch lady that hasn't been in much else was good.

The plot, however, was just average.  The comedy was also just average - I was expecting to laugh a lot more than I did.  The love story?  Below average.  I wasn't feeling the connection at all.

I have to say I did enjoy it though as I'm also a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan and they did a decent job. It was a bit too condensed and although they used a lot of the story line they did change things a bit and didn't explain a few key things such as why was Julia Hoffman living at Collinwood and why she was the drinker. That's just an example of the differences.  I wonder what someone who has never seen the series would think of the movie and curious to read a review by such a person. Overall though it was very entertaining and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars though it's more of a 3.5 for me. Fun.,1351814400,,702,3.909090909090909

Johnny Depp pulls off his wonderful weird routine as usual, along with Helena! Chloe was great, she is just a incredible young actress. I also personally enjoyed the cameo from Alice Cooper!

I found it true to the spirit of the original TV show (which I watched as a kid against my mother's orders) and yet its own creation.

The only item I went back and forth upon was Depp's make-up as it was both a send-up of Nosferatu and a bit jarring to the suspension of disbelief.

If you are waiting for this movie to relate to the old t.v. series, you will be highly disappointed. This movie, unfortunately, follows the same route as the remake of ""The Stepford Wives."" It takes a horror classic and makes it into over the camp comedy movie. Now the original Dark Shadows did have unintentional humor in it but the actors all took their roles seriously. In this movie, this is not the case. The best peroformances do come from Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer. Eva Green makes a good Angelique. Helena Bonham Carter looks like Grayson Hall but that is it. She acts nothing like Grayson Hall, but in all fairness, who can. The relationship between Barnabas and Dr. Hoffman from the series is nonexisting here. The actress, who plays Carolyn, looks like a child than the spoiled pre-Paris Hilton bitch, that Nancy Barrett played her years ago. Other disappointments, Maggie Evans, Victoria Winters and Josette are all one person. Also, the cameo scene with Jonathan Frid, his last performance before he died, he really did this time,LOL, David Selby, Lara Parker and Kathryn Leigh Scott is so fast that you can miss them with a blink of an eye. The Roger Collins character should have just been left out of the movie because it was wasted.

Barnabas encounters all of the new technology as ""magic,"" with the expected humorous outcomes.  Dark and yet quirky, the film is quite fun, and you develop a sympathy for the vampire and his relatives in escaping the evil punishment.

Michelle Pfieffer does almost as well with comedy as she did in Hairspray and the soundtrack with the Moody Blues and the Carpenters stands on its own. i almost expected Lynn Anderson's ""Never promised you a rose garden,"" it's that 70's. Eva Green, so good in the Dreamers and Casino Royale is stunning as femme fatale Angelique (or was it Angel?). Some parts are too graphic for kids and the kids in this movie aren't of the sheltered variety but all in all, good fun. Johnny Depp has some good oneliners and even when he doesn't, he seems to do wry irony well, even if unspoken. Watched this one more times than i care to count.",1351641600,2,828,4.213836477987422

Johnny Depp could not save the lack of well written comedy/drama.  The movie gave the appearance of being thrown together hoping that star quality would save it.  Worst direction I have seen, really murdered Dark Shadows without any farse relief in sight.  It goes to show that doing it for the money can do you in.

Great performances also by Michele Pfieffer, Helena Bonham Carter, and Jackie Earl Haley.  Eva Greene was the real standout.  She was so deliciously evil! Johnny Lee Miller's character was funny, but for such a talented actor, he did not get nearly enough screen time.  Chloe Grace Moretz is a terrific actress, but was also underused in this movie.

 Seems like more movies are coming out from Hollywood with very little attention to details. Granted, they were writing a comedy but the plot should still have something to it besides just capitalizing on the actors fame and the the watchers remembering the old TV series. I really think movies should be able to stand on their own. In my opinion, it's just laziness and the desire to mae a quick buck.",1351468800,,577,4.548076923076923

It was the year 1752 when Barnabas' parents came to America to expand their business empire. But after establishing the thriving New England fishing town of Collinsport, the family experienced a series of misfortunes when Barnabas fell for the gorgeous Josette DuPres and cast aside beautiful witch Angelique, who cursed him with eternal life and buried him deep in the earth. Returning home to Collinwood Manor after being dug up by a construction crew in 1972, Barnabas learns that Angelique has nearly driven his family out of business, and turned the townspeople against them.

I almost didn't buy this movie because there were so many bad reviews, I rented it first instead and I loved it! It is a typical Depp/Burton movie which means it's quirky and dark. Johnny Depp was great, the storyline was great. There were a few scenes that were over the top, (the love scene with Barnabas and Angelique) but overall, it was really enjoyable.

4977074,2,B00683T5CW,I am a fan of the original series. I was really excited to see how Burton and Depp treated this as fans. But it was obvious from the get that they were trying too hard to make it their own and they just couldn't decide if they were going to go with comedy or camp. I would have enjoyed a really dark campy movie that would have bitten off the first say two to three seasons of Dark Shadows. They're eyes were too big and they over-extended themselves. Not to mention that their attempts at comedy and camp just ended up looking like bad writing and over production. I was not impressed. I did like Depp's look. That's one star and another star for including Alice Cooper (I won't spoil the surprise). But everything else is just blah.,1351468800,,734,4.326086956521739

4977077,1,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton's movie adaptation of the Dark Shadows soap opera is a travesty, a waste of valuable celluloid, and an affront to the memory of Jonathan Frid, who makes a cameo appearance. The movie should be offensive to any Dark Shadows fan. It goes without saying that even with its limitations, the original Dark Shadow episodes are far superior to the pablum Burton serves with this movie. Johnny Depp maintains he was a Dark Shadow fan. This hard to believe, because if he was a true fan of the original series he would not have consented to acting in this role and would have had nothing to do with the making of this movie.

A real fan of Dark Shadows should stay far, far away.",1351382400,,681,4.448
4977078,4,B00683T5CW,"I am only 25, but am a big fan of the original Dark Shadows tv series. With all of the mixed reviews this movie received, seemingly more so negative, I figured I would stay away from it. However after my father saw it on a plane he recommend we give it a shot. The movie was not what I expected. While it definitely is not a 100% throw back to the old series I found the story and overall plot to be entertaining and well crafted. The key here I feel is Johnny Depp's Barnabas. I feel he stayed very true to Johnathan Frid's overall style of the character of Barnabas with some humor thrown into the mix. He and Eva Green definitely carry the movie. Eva Green made for a very menacing and cruel Angelique and was a great leading lady opposite Johnny Depp. The rest of the cast played their characters well, but played modern societies image of a typical modern dysfunctional family rather than a secretive family with a rich, but dark history. The goal of the movie seemed to be to compile all of the major events in the first half of the original series in the ""modern day"" (1960s in the old show 1970s in the movie) as well as touch on how Barnabas was cursed. The key to enjoying this movie is to go in with an open mind. Do not expect the old series, but expect a drama/comedy with a modern and Tim Burton style Gothic twist, which is actually not over done in this movie, with some familiar elements. Is it a candidate for greatest movie ever made? Of course not, but If you go in with this in mind you will probably enjoy this movie.",1351382400,,1539,4.238095238095238
4977079,2,B00683T5CW,"""Dark Shadows"" was a soap opera back in the late 1960's whose characters had skeletons in their closet, literally. The original show had one of the first sympathetic portrayals of a vampire who wasn't all bad.  The movie had promise with the campy acting, good atmosphere background music, and nice visuals. BUT, the characters were not treated well - the witch became a Superman arch-villain, the doctor (my favorite from the original TV show) was treated shabbily and opportunities for a real plot were just wasted.  Changes from the original storyline didn't make sense and the ending of the movie was utterly forgettable. The filmmakers could have had a lot of fun with Barnabas' angst in not wanting to kill people and the whole haunted, dysfunctional family.  Too bad, if they had done it right, they could have made more movies starring the Collins Family.",1351382400,,863,4.937931034482759

(Not all, Alice In Wonderland and Charlie and Chocolate Factory were extremely bad in my personal opinion.)I followed the IMDB news since November, and I won pre screening tickets via a radio contest. The movie was good, not quite like the original show but then it'd be hard to cram years worth of 20 min daily soap opera into a two hour movie. The movie did not exceed my expectations, or meet them, but the movie was good. The makeup for Barnabas is a little extreme but I understood the look they were going for. The jokes were generally funny, not all but enough to keep me entertained. There are some plot holes, and I still don't see the chemistry between Victoria and Barnabas but what movie doesn't? The costumes were fun and Alice Cooper was nice. The beginning ten minutes were amazing, and the end fight scene was good. There is definitely room for a sequel, too.

While Depp and Carter are superb as usual in Dark Shadows, it is the film itself that is an ambitious remake that falls short.  To Dark Shadows's credit, there are many good pieces (the ambitious and potential), but those pieces come off as scattered and lacking the same oomph as most Tim Burton films do.  Dark Shadows is funny given its role as a dark comedy, but it is also 'silly,' which makes the laughs a bit temporary and superficial.

The plot is as follows: Barnabas Collins (Depp), a member of a family of prominent fishermen/fish marketers, is the protagonist of the story. After his lover jumps to her death after being put under a spell by jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green).  Angelique ultimately curses Barnabas and the Collins family making Barnabas a vampire who is ultimately buried alive.  Two centuries later, Barnabas's coffin is dug up and he is alive in full fledge vampire form.  He returns to his mansion to restore the family fishing business and try to undo Angelique's fishing business, which became the standard after Angelique turns the town against the descendants/remaining Collins family.  Victoria, a non-family members comes to the mansion to serve as a governess for David Collins (Gully McGrath) whose mother was the victim of Angelique's witchcraft.  Barnabas Collins falls for Victoria and ultimately saves her from Angelique's witchcraft.

Ultimately, the plot is a bit 'all over the place' much like the overall film. It is scattered and over-ambitious. Writers do well by making the beginning and end of the film connect, but some of the inner plot is questionable.  As stated earlier, there is enough comical moments to make Dark Shadows enjoyable for a while.  However, the ludicrousness and silliness sometimes supersede the comical nature, which ultimately hurts this Tim Burton offering. The ambitious elements furthermore are not enough to carry this film.",1351209600,,3025,6.803108808290156

The cast is great, especially Johnny Depp as Barnabas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth, and especially considering they both had some really big shoes to fill from Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett, the original Barnabas and Elizabeth from the show.

Eva Green is deliciously nasty as Angelique, but she also shows she still has a soft spot in her 'love' for Barnabas despite the fact she has managed to ruin his family for generations in revenge for his rejecting her.

This is a wonderful tribute to an iconic show at least in my opinion. I can watch it over and over again.",1351123200,2,792,4.563380281690141

You'd be forgiven for thinking so. Did you think Johnny Depp was a vampire acclimating to modern times in a family of vampires that were somehow related to him? You'd be wrong as I was. Seriously, deceptive previews need to end, but I guess they exist to mask semi-funny plot-thin flicks like this that offer very little that's new and interesting.

The time to see it? Two years from now, around Halloween, on TV during a Sunday afternoon after your team's football game with two beers in you, wavering between a nap and whatever's on TV. This is your 'whatever'.",1351036800,,725,4.534351145038168

4977115,1,B00683T5CW,"There are so many things wrong with this film. In a nutshell: it seems as though Tim Burton is trying too hard to be ""Tim Burton"". We've all seen up and coming director's trying to copy the style of previous great directors and completely fall short of the mark. In this case it's Burton trying to copy himself.

Don't get me wrong. I have been a huge Tim Burton fan since the beginning, even using his work for a final in my film class. After all who can go wrong with a guy whose dream was to be the guy in the Godzilla suit!

Sadly, his movies of late are missing an element that made his movies unique and quirky masterpieces. It's almost as if a child has gotten bored with his favorite toy, yet still goes through the motions in playing with it.

This movie is DULL! Lackluster performances by ALL the actors/actresses involved. Every character is flat out boring, and gives you absolutely no reason to become invested in them. The humor is tired, unoriginal and just not humorous. The beloved quirkiness of Burton's previous films like Edward Scissorhands (one of the best films ever) is absent. The story-line has the same affect of fingernails on a chalkboard. The bulk of the characters have zero purpose.

Quite frankly, Burton needs to get over his man-crush with Johnny Depp. His movies are beginning to prove that directors shouldn't direct their significant others. It's time to bury the Burton/Depp/Bonham-Carter triangle. It's becoming old and too comfortable...with each providing a ""lazy"" product. What previous chemistry there was has evaporated and these great talents are going to waste.

There really isn't anything good about this film. Each aspect, directing...acting...writing...style...cinematography...all sub-par and boring. Nothing here to stimulate your senses to make you want to sit through this cinematic train wreck!",1351036800,5,1851,5.01628664495114

The music clips which -don't really fit the movie. Where was the great Danny Elfman's touch? Not here. Tim Burton put his name on this smelly fiasco? And Johnny Depp, what a disappointment. No acting ability in this one-anyone could have done what he did. So sad to see Hollywood putting out garbage on the classic tv show. Don't they have other projects to invest in? And Barnabus getting a BJ by the doctor? Really? Not age appropriate at all. I can't believe the smut they stick into kids movies. Was it really necessary? And the killing of innocents, workmen and hippies? I almost turned this off half way through, see, the problem of who lit the candles in the 200 year old secret passageway bothered me, as did no dust on his precious treasures down there. So many 'bad' plot turns and poor writing make this a loser for all involved. Best parts are the vintage pop tunes and woodwork in the mansion. When the best actor of the movie is Alice Cooper-the woman, you got a problem. I pray to god they don't make a sequal to this turkey PLEASE!!!!",1350950400,3,1216,4.531818181818182

Dark Shadows 'the movie' with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter is awful in character changes, dialogue and casting.  The writers should be chained in coffins and the keys to the locks thrown away.  The music is a horrible distraction and not worthy of Robert Cobert, who was the musical genius of the original series, the two movies out of the original series and the revival.  Gothic romance and slow developing horror is substituted here for fast paced special effects that do unjustice to building suspense.  While I normally am a fan of Mr. Depp and Ms. Bonham Carter;  neither could save such an empty, modernized distortion of a true classic.  If you are have been unfortunate, like I believe I am, in purchasing this version and watching it, please take the disc out of the case and use it for bird cage liner.  Your friends will thank you for this, but your bird will give you the bird.  If you are reading this considering whether you should purchase this, I suggest you do not buy it.

I know this is based off of a 70's cult soap opera, and when you watch the movie you will see they tried to put the entire series within less than 2 hours.

I always thought it was kind of campy and if I remember correctly it was live and you could frequently see the mistakes made by the actors or the crew. This movie starring Johnny Depp was a fun movie to watch. I think Depp did a very good job with this character and the laughs came pretty easy the first two thirds of the movie. But then, towards the end, it seemed it wanted to become a scary/serious movie. That is why it has a rating from me of three stars. If it would have stayed on track I think the movie night have been better. But once it strayed from comedy, I kind of became disappointed.

The movie was faithful to the old soap in plot and timing. But I realized that the old soap was slow and sometimes boring, and I found myself wondering what I saw in it as a kid.

4977169,1,B00683T5CW,"This 2012 film is a very loose adaptation of various storylines from the cult gothic suspense soap opera DARK SHADOWS (1966-71).  In this, Tim Burton's version, the vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to the ancestral mansion after 200 years locked in a coffin, determined to restore the sagging family fortunes.  There are brief moments of real horror, as well as much crude fish-out-of-water humor as Barnabas tries to get used to life in 1972.  As is usual with Burton, the film is visually quite striking.

At one point during the film, Barnabas asks Willie (Jackie Earl Haley), his mentally-enslaved mortal lackey, to dispose of the corpse of one of his victims.  On learning of this tragedy, Willie shrugs it off with: ""I never liked the bitch anyway.""  As one who had watched the original show, I immediately recalled that this attitude was nothing like that of the original Willie (John Karlen), who was constantly fighting against his master's mind-control, who always tried, in one way or another, to save his master's victims and prevent his killings, and who always grieved deeply when he failed.

But my point is not to complain that this film is unfaithful to the old series (though it certainly is).  My point is to explain why it fails on its own terms.  The problem with Willie's attitude here is that it is not just Willie's attitude --it is everybody's.  NOBODY cares that Barnabas is an undead serial murderer.  Not Collins matriarch Elizabeth Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer); not her teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Moretz); not her 10-year old nephew David (Gulliver McGrath); not live-in psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter); not David's governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote).  And it is not as though they don't find out.  The only character who tries to make an issue out of his murders is the evil witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and she is motivated not by morality, but petty revenge.

Even Josette DuPres, who in the original threw herself off a cliff to escape Barnabas and avoid becoming like him, has no such motive here.  Here, she dives off the cliff for entirely different reasons.  Here, Josette's ghost entirely approves of Barnabas, and would like nothing less than to be united with him forever as an immortal undead serial murderer.

Are the scriptwriter and director trying to make some kind of ironic point with all this moral obtuseness?  Not as far as I can tell.  They seem merely to project their own attitudes.  Here, Barnabas swears to Elizabeth that he would never harm family.  Unlike the original Barnabas (who for all his fine talk would not have hesitated to murder even little David) he apparently speaks the truth.  The script constantly returns to this theme of family loyalty, a virtue that apparently excuses and justifies all other crimes.  Apparently, we are expected to cheer for and root for Barnabas, even after watching him butcher a half-dozen construction workers and an entire van-full of nice young hippies.  We are then expected to nod with approval as he preaches family values and good parenting to Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller).  This is mafia morality.

This is not vampire horror, nor even (primarily) vampire comedy.  It is vampire fantasy.  Burton assumes his audience WANT to become vampires, like Bela Swann in the TWILIGHT series.  But this vampire is no Edward Cullen: a sparkly do-gooder who never takes human blood.  He looks like a corpse (moreso even than the original Barnabas, played with suitable menace by craggy-faced Jonathan Frid) and murders without compunction.  That is why, whether you label it horror or comedy, it simply does not work.  We cannot be scared because there is no-one to root for (except the anonymous victims); we cannot laugh because it is just not funny.

The main horror comes from our glimpse into the dark hearts and diseased souls of Tim Burton and Seth Grahame-Smith.  They seriously need their butts kicked.",1350777600,29,3958,4.99236641221374

Between watching the original series and this movie, I of course make the comparisons and notice the similarities and the differences between them.  It also made me want to read the books by Lara Parker as well.

However, the reason I give it four stars is, is that it can get slow in some of the parts.  It of course still sticks with some of the original series, as well as stray from a certian episode that it's trying to represent.

4977184,4,B00683T5CW,"The Burton/Depp formula has been tried and proven so many times that it needs no further comment. When you see them pair up, just watch it. This flick meets their finest standards.

As a continuation of the original: I wish I could comment, but I never became a fan. But, as entertainment in itself, this offers more laughs than just about anything else in theaters this season. Depp's utterly straight-faced rendering makes the movie, of course. The simian housekeeper has his moments, and the bratty teenage girl comes into her own late in the game. (Hint: when ""that time of month"" comes, she has some serious issues around shaving her legs.)

Fine, fun, and forgettable entertainment. It has some great lines, it sustains its energy, but I can't say it did much for me the day after I saw it - and that's one big way I evaluate a movie.

While the movie is indeed ""quirky"", it does do a creditable job of setting the Dark Shadows tone overall.  Scenery and acting are solid, but the characters really do not seem to have consistent motivation and are not well explored or well used.  Storyline wanders between the expected family revival / vengeance plots and the side trips to subordinate plotlines are short, vaguely unsatisfying, and well, ""trippy"" is really appropriate.  It's possible this is a result of story compression; Depp tries to do so much with this movie, it's hard for it to stay consistent, and there's a feeling that really he wanted to do a miniseries from the material here.  The ending seems both overdone and underdone at the same time.  At any rate, as a whole it's entertaining but don't expect to glean much meaning from the story or gain empathy for the characters - likely you won't.

4977217,1,B00683T5CW,"This movie was just terrible.  Even if we'd been able to stream it for free I would still be here writing a negative review...alas, I paid $4 for this stinker.  The previews did a fair job of ""selling"" the movie, but, honestly, the two scenes in the previews that made us chuckle are not even funny when seen in the context of the movie.  Johnny Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow (and in so many other roles), so we hoped that that same subtly smarmy charisma would be evident in this movie.  Sadly, there's nothing subtle about his character, Barney, in this film...he's just plain smarmy.

The violence (Barney is a vampire, after all, and he does feed on people) is unnecessary and decidedly NOT funny.  Yes, I get it...it's a dark comedy.  And it is dark...it's just not very funny.  If Barney's disregard for human life was intended to add depth to his character in some way, then it failed.  Instead, it made me just not like him much at all.

I was also suprised by the sexual content...nothing graphic, mind you, just inappropriate for younger kids.  I came within seconds of turning it off and not allowing my 14 yo to watch the rest of the movie.  Under current ""standards,"" the movie isn't exactly rated R, but it's just too offensive to be comfortably in the PG-13 camp.  It saddens me that the ""powers that be"" in the MPAA consider material like this suitable for kids as young as 13!  And I'm sorry I can't provide any solid examples from the movie...I've just spent the past two days purging it from my head. =D

So unless you are a HUGE fan of the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton/Helena Bonham Carter team, I suggest you skip this one.  And certainly don't let your kids (mid-teen or younger) watch it!",1350259200,4,1709,4.5

Yes it was campy and over the top BUT enough to be interesting and enjoyable!  I loved Angelique as she created so many problems for the Collins family and poor Barnabus. Johnny Depp does a FANTASTIC job as Barnabus Collins, he remains dead faced but uses his eyes and body language to create a wonderful believable vampire character. I will not go into all the details as others have, but believe me it is NOT a waste of money to get this DVD or Blue Ray. No you will not see Gore and excess vampire violence, Like the TV show, it tunes into the Family characters and issues they face. Mine you their issues are a bit different than most families, Vampires, Werewolves, Witches wanting to destroy you. But they do knit it all together nicely . The music was a great ride for anyone over 40, some very memorable songs which fit right in with the 60-70s theme. The fact that so many stars agreed to be in such a movie is a testimony to the Original TV casts creating this unforgetable story line. the ONLY thing I wish Tim Burton did was not FLASH the 4 Original TV characters on screen. They should have had at least a minute or two to converse with Barnabus, if only to say hello and thank you for inviting us to your grand party.

4977235,2,B00683T5CW,"Let me start right off the bat by saying that I am a die hard fan of Tim Burton. I will see anything and everything the man does. I think he's a genius. However, even geniuses can have those moments where they aren't knocking it out of the park. 'Dark Shadows' is one of those moments. It has all the right ingredients, but isn't fully stirred to a wonderful brew.

Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is turned into a vampire, cursed by the witch Angelique (Eva Green), and buried. Centuries later, Barnabas is dug up in 1972. Upon returning to his home, Collinwood, he meets the latest Collins family descendants, headed by Michelle Pfeiffer. Barnabas then sets out to return his family, home, and family business to it's former glory, but witch Angelique once again raises her head to cause problems.

I never saw the original 'Dark Shadows' TV series or movies, so there is nothing I can say about that and I can't compare. Tim Burton is certainly brilliant when it comes to style and flare, but his recent output has all been just that - style and flare. That's 'Dark Shadows'. It also doesn't help any that the movie has the same cold detachment that his previous movie, ""Alice In Wonderland"", suffered from. Burton has no problem putting together a stellar cast who seem to want to rise to the occassion, but the movie doesn't rise to their level. Depp is fantastic, of course, with a great, classic look. He sparkles in his scenes. The supporting cast of Pfeiffer, Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Chloe Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter, and Christopher Lee, all do their best, but they are in a movie that mostly slumps along not realizing the dazzling people it has to work with. Style-wise, the movie is wonderful, of course. It has some great cinematography, production design, and striking visuals. Sometimes, in some movies, that's enough. But it's not here. Burton can do better.

'Dark Shadows' isn't a bad movie by any means. It's certainly watchable, and even enjoyable and entertaining in parts, but it doesn't feel like all the parts are there. That the filmmakers settled for middle of the road. The potential is there in abundance, but no one took too much interest. The final climax is rousing, to be sure, but it felt too quick and not exploited to the the crazy, over the topness that it could of been. A ""Death Becomes Her"" sort of thing, especially with the character of Angelique. That's the feeling throughout the whole movie. That feeling of 'What could of been'.

In the end, 'Dark Shadows' is a mixed bag and a lost opportunity. I used to like seeing Tim Burton do his spin of well known, existing properties, but enough is enough. I am really eager for Tim to go back and do something original. Give us the next 'Beetlejuice', the next 'Edward Scissorhands'. Hopefully, the recent ""Frankenweenie"" returns Tim to his former glory. But this one? It's basically a ""Well, it looked good"" kind of a movie.",1350086400,9,2924,4.705078125

4977237,4,B00683T5CW,"I rented this because I'd seen the promos that looked funny. This movie is a comedy, but as expected it's 'dark' without as much humor as I would have liked. It's there, and it's smart, but I was just hoping for more.

Since I had not seen the television show my mind wasn't tainted with what should have been. I viewed the movie without any preconceived notions; not having read any reviews here or elsewhere. That was probably a good thing. Nothing to compare it to and not a diehard fan of the series, I found it enjoyable.

Depp was excellent, as usual and his supporting cast very good as well. Tim Burton didn't disappoint this viewer, but it was different than expected.

It's not for kids. Both the sexual references, and scary gore would be too much for most under 12. Remember, he's a vampire and needs to feed.

If you're looking for a fairly mild Halloween-ish movie, with a few laughs, some nostalgic 70's references and mild discomfort from anxious anticipation of what might come next with vampires and ghosts, this one is for you.

4977241,4,B00683T5CW,"Harboring a deep affinity for the series, and being appreciative of the productions of Tim Burton {especially in combination with Maestro Danny Elfman's orchestrations}, it seemed a natural inspection. He does have a knack for splendidly presenting the Gothic sensibility to a fine point, after all.

I first became pleasantly aware of this sinister series through rebroadcasts on a local channel, and has since become preferred entertainment fare, which is presented in a serious vain, whose Gothic psychodramas seem to reflect many predispositions and innate interests. The uses of mood lighting, suspenseful music, occult story lines, grants it a brooding atmosphere similar to Hammer films, yet imbued with Dan Curtis' unique psychological darkness. Dark Shadows features not only vampires & witches, but warlocks, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, sinister cults, insane preachers, time-travels, mad killers, demons, & many more creatures & situations of a paranormal nature.

As far as Dark Shadows films are concerned, I personally recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Dark-Shadows/dp/B008JL8NQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-Dark-Shadows/dp/B008JLBNLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of Dark Shadows</a>.

So, when I first viewed the preview for the film, it was a bit underwhelming, as it focuses primarily on the 70's comedic elements, yet in the overall film, it actually became beside the point. Actually, I thought it a bit appropriate after all, that since the series was broadcast in the late 60's/early 70's season {actually premiering in Year 1 A.S.}, that the setting seemed to make sense for a plot such as this. Being leery of any 'remakes, since the early 90's adaptation was actually a pleasing tribute, but what may be condensed in a 113 minute film? Obviously, if you want the real thing, just continue viewing and submerging yourself therein. I have been collecting these on DVD as they became available, & most remarkably, the entire series has recently become available in the marvelous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-The-Complete-Original-Series-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B007PZ6SYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)</a>.

In October of VII A.S., Barnabas Collins is unleashed from a century of subterranean incarceration by construction workmen {instead of groundskeeper Willy Loomis immediately, whom he meets shortly}, who of course, sates his blood lust forthwith. He meets a drunken Willy {his 'Renfield'} wandering the Collinswood grounds among the pumpkins, who after a quick interrogation about the current surroundings, quickly assumes his role.

Arriving at the Collinswood estate, he meets with elegant matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and the rest of the surviving family. She is obviously taken aback by his arrival {return}, thus revealing some interesting house secrets during the introduction. After all, a pleasantly dark chamber via a secret passageway is a necessity for any vampire! His descriptions of the architecture and history of the fine resident possessions therein are a remarkable relation, in marked appreciation for the construction of their materialization.

Present are Elizabeth {the lovely, stately, lady of the manor}, Dr. Hoffman {here, the professional intellectual physician is portrayed as an attractive, fiery-haired lush living a life of quiet desperation}, David {well-portrayed, rather like a Damien}, pretty little Carolyn Stoddard {the impetuous blonde here portrayed as a hippie-like stoner / rebellious 'party girl' type}, & Roger Collins {the stoic gentleman here portrayed as a rude, inconstant, boorish lothario}. While Barnabas himself is here portrayed in a more slender variation, more akin to a callow Nosferatu, intentionally depicted.

With the help of these new-found relatives, Barnabas goes about familiarizing himself with the culture, to some amusing interactions with automobiles, entertainment evolutions, & technological advancements. The juxtaposition between a gentleman of eloquence, fine tastes, irrefutable deportment, dashing style, and elite dispositions, to that of an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.

Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum. Most amusingly intriguing indeed.

He eventually becomes re-acquainted with a busty Angelique Bouchard, the source of his torments, for those unfamiliar, in what would amount to be an undead fatal attraction, the witch who commended him into the coffin-prison for refuting her advances in favor of his dear Josette DuPres {a sweetly diminutive fianc}, who herself plunged from Widow's Hill at the bidding of black witchcraft. Harboring resentment of Barnabas & the successes of The Collins Family since childhood, Angelique uses her own immortality & wiles to raise her family name to prominence. Of course, that re-acquaintance yields a passionate fling finally culminating in a final battle.

Notable scenes include: one Alice Cooper performing at a ball circa Welcome to My Nightmare, with Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott in attendance. ""David! Go watch the Cooper woman!""; a haggard Christopher Lee as Clarney the fisherman hypnotized by Barnabas; Barnabas lays some hippies to waste while camping in the forest.

As pleasurably typical of Tim Burton productions, the sets are a majestic marvel to behold, the music enriching with an inspired soundtrack by Danny Elfman, familiar & compelling characterizations, complimenting the overall experience. In this case, this rendition is an amusing aside, created as a quirky notion of how a vampire would interact with an outside herd world, in continued predation, of course. As a combination Gothic / Comedy / Thriller, it certainly has its moments in the shadows, even while venturing into the lightmare, and may certainly be good for a nefarious cachinnation or two, while asserting an enhanced appreciation for the core origins.",1350000000,,6358,6.029900332225914

Occasionally when I was young, and home sick from school, I would click on Dark Shadows. I never kept it there -- it was just another soap opera, as far as I was concerned.
Dark Shadows, the movie, is much different. It's directed by Tim Burton, the creator of the current top movie,  Frankenweenie.
It stars Johnny Depp and the inclusion of this director and mega-star are what make it worth a look.
The story revolves around the Collins family who migrated to Maine and set up a fishing port, naming it Collinsport.
When a teen, the son, Barnabas Collins (Depp) subduces the family maid, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). He regrets his decision and tells her he doesn't love her. That would be bad enough to tell any woman, but in this case she's a witch. She decides to put a curse on him, if he won't be with her he won't be with anyone.
He falls for Josett du Pres (Bella Heathcote). Angelique puts a spell on his true love, causing Josett to leap off a cliff. Heartbroken, Barnabas follows her, but he doesn't die, he comes back as a vampire.
Angelique then rials up the townspeople telling what Barnabas is, and what he's done to Josett.
He is captured and buried alive, only to be dug up during construction 196 years later. The best part of the show is Depp's reaction to this new century he has landed in.
It's quirky, funny and has a neat performance by Alice Cooper but Burton seems to search for a way to end the show.",1349913600,2,1496,4.476190476190476

Now, I should mention here that I was absolutely addicted to the tv series when I was growing up. The show came on at 4:00 pm every day.  My bus didn't drop me off until 4:10.  I would literally jump off the bus and RUN up the yard into my house so I could watch the last 20 minutes.  We had one of those huge Sylvania black & white console television sets in our living room. I think I watched all the seasons in black and white, even after they started broadcasting in color. I had a mad crush on Jonathan Frid when I was in middle school.

Sadly, this movie is bad.  I mean really, really bad.  It alternates between gory violence and campy humor and doesn't really do a good job at either one.  I ended up turning it off about 2/3 of the way through because I just couldn't bring myself to watch any more of it.

I have watched every Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration, and every Tim Burton art piece available.  Without a doubt in my mind I will watch this movie over and over again.  I have to date purchased 4 copies of dark Shadows, three as gifts.

Please those of you out there who can see/hear my written voice stop what you are doing, get this movie, (DO NOT RENT IT, BUY IT) close the blinds turn the ringer on your phone off and watch this movie.

The only thing I want now is the sequel, and the sequels sequel.

I hope Tim Burton ignores the critics of his works and focuses only on his genius, continuing to gives us (BY US) I mean the people that do understand and appreciate his works of art more and more and more.

Additionally Michelle Pfeiffers greatest vehicle to date.  Helena Bohnam-Carter pure genius.

4977256,2,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and ""Dark Shadows"" would seem to be a match made in heaven, high-camp or otherwise. Unfortunately, it's not. The story, which combines a Gothic love triangle, lazy jokes about 1970s pop culture, and 200-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins's struggle to break a curse set on his house by the witch whose love he rejected in the 18th century and restore his family's fortunes, never comes together in any meaningful way. The movie is overpopulated, and we are given little reason to care about any of the characters.

This new movie is certainly not perfect but the folks who made it --

of the original.

The film has brought renewed attention to the

In the late and wonderful Jonathan Frid's hands, the character of Barnabas Collins was poignant, nuanced, and at times, quite scary. Johnny Depp turned the character into a candy-colored clown.

Even if you are a Burton/Depp fan (and I used to be), you'll see this film for what it is: a complete mishmash that has no clue what it wants to be. Subplots are thrown in, characters reduced to a single note, lots of flash but no substance.

4977273,4,B00683T5CW,"Although I am a fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, I was none too eager to see their versions of Barnaby Collins and DARK SHADOWS. I even hesitated to get the DVD just thinking it would be a campy version of TV cult classic. Oddly enough, even though it was campy, it worked. Depp give us his interpretation of Barnaby Collins as only Johnny Depp can, yet, he does not go over the top as one would expect with this material. Even Tim Burton seems to be toned down from his normal style.
We actually have an interesting vampire story with a full background. Barnabas Collins has a tragic background that led to him being cursed forever as a vampire. Two centuries have passed and Barnabas has show up at his family estate. I enjoyed the backstory of where he has been for two centuries and the current situation of his relatives. It's a funny idea thinking one of your ancestors who happens to be a vampire shows up at your home one day.
Barnabas promises not to harm any of his relatives and he is allowed to stay if he promises to help the family business thrive again.
I was floored by Tim Burton's DARK SHADOWS. It's a fun movie with just the right amount of camp to make it entertaining. Lovely Michelle Pfeiffer shows her best as the current Collins matriach trying to hold a crumbling family and empire together.
Helena Bonham Carter has a slow start as the resident psychiatrist for Pfeiffer's nephew, who doesn't seem so emotionally wounded as to need a full tim psychiatrist. Carter's character seems to be a throw away at first. Flamboyant and wild, her character doesn't deserve any respect from the family that has hired her, yet things changes after she knows Barnaby's secret.
Poor Barnaby doesn't want to be a vampire. He just wants to be mortal. It's not his fault that he is a vampire and it sure is not his fault that several innocent locals have to give their lives to feed his hunger for blood. Here is the only dark part of the film.
The Collins family has been cursed by a witch and imagine the power of a witch and a vampire ""getting it on.""
Truly funny scene. The story is set in 1972 and the 1970's music is just right one. And who would expect Alice Cooper to be in a Tim Burton film, yet who better to be in a Tim Burton film than Alice Cooper?? Barnaby Collins tries to get with the times and hires that Alice Cooper ""woman"" to perform at a ""ball."" Who throws a ball in 1972 anyhow? The delightful part of the film is the confusion of two eras and the fun of someone being out of place ina  new time. If you missed Alice Cooper in the 70's, here is your chance to see him perform now. Even though 40 years has passed, they seem to be able to wipe away those years when looking at Alice.

4977274,1,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton's Dark Shadows is definitive proof that you really CAN polish a turd.  Yes, the movie's visuals are quite polished and easy on the eyes, but that does not give the rest of the movie a pass.  I am a fan of the original series, and I can tell you that this is by no means anywhere close to the spirit of the original material. I have heard from some that this is a ""dark comedy."" I would have to disagree. This film plays like a broken metronome that bounces back and forth between puerile wacky slapstick and attempts at horror. The result is a two hour, $150 million identity crisis that is neither funny nor scary. I read recently that there was an earlier version of the script which was penned by John August, who wrote Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"". August's version was much darker, took itself more seriously, was more complex, and had more of a sense of history to it. August said that there were still some elements of humor to his version, but it wasn't in your face juvenile comedy. Burton and Depp decided to jettison August's script in favor of one written by Seth Grahame-Smith, whose credits include ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" and ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"". These books in Barnes and Noble stores reside in a niche section titled ""Paranormal Teen Romance."" Every time I pass this section I have to do an eyeroll. Grahame-Smith had never even seen the original series. His ""take"" was written after viewing some episodes provided by Burton. If you ask the average fan of the original show what they remember most fondly about it they will most likely tell you that it was a particular story arc or a certain character, e.g. Quentin or the Reverend Trask. What you most likely NOT hear from them is that it was campy. That seems to be the one element that was taken from the source materiel and nothing else. If your movie is going to masquerade with the same name as the original, use the same character names as the original, include the name of the series creator in your credits, and even use the same title font as the original, one would assume that you would at least try to retain the slightest semblance to the original. If Burton and Depp wanted to be the slightest bit honest about this movie, they should have named this effort ""Puerile Crappy Vampire Out of Time Movie, with One-Joke Premise Stretched for Two Hours."" It also didn't help that Depp was made to like like a Geisha that was booted out of a Japanese anime cartoon.",1349654400,45,2471,4.538116591928251
4977275,2,B00683T5CW,"I really wanted to like this and for the first half hour or so, I did. But things went down hill fast for me once the silly comedy started kicking in.

I'm a huge Dark Shadows fan and I was hoping for something on the more darker, mysterious side. Heck, I would of even excepted dry humour here and there. But, leave it to good ol' Tim Burton to upstage the classic storyline with his usual flamboyant style of gay candy art and silly hijinks. Needless to say, I was far from impressed with Edward Scissorhands.

Why, at the very beginning of the movie, before the opening credits, do they have the brief chapter,(that explains Barnabas's tragic life), be so dark and chilling, and then later, flip it over like a hot pancake and turn into a hot mess of a joke? It just makes no sense to me.

The sex scene between Barnabas and Angelique (flying around the office as they rip each other's clothes off, destroying all the furniture) was just way 'too over the top'. It came off as a 'Naked Gun' parody. Not only that, we just saw (!!) the same exact scene (though, left more to the imagination) in the latest, Twilight movie. (Where Edward and Bella make love on their honeymoon, leaving the room destroyed.) Both films came out around the same time. Didn't anyone notice, in Hollywood, that the joke had just been done?

And don't get me started on Alice Cooper singing under a disco ball during the big party scene. Talk about the final nail in the coffin. If I wanted to watch a vampire movie with a funny disco scene, I'd rather be watching Jim Carrey and Lauren Hutton in, 'Once Bitten' dancing to the tune of, ""Hands off! He belongs to me!"" Now that's what I call, a really funny scene. And, hot, too. (the dance scene in 'Fright Night' with Chris Sarandon and Amanda Bearse, was cool, too!)

But,wait! There IS something that I liked very much about the Dark Shadows movie. The opening credits! Of all things! Go figure.

I love the song, 'Nights in White Satin' performed by The Moody Blues, which plays during Vicki's train ride to Collinwood. Oh-My-God! It's so neat! I actually went to the movies, twice, just to 'experience' this scene again.

It was a real 'goose bumpy' moment for me. For days, I couldn't get the movie's opening out of my head. It's really a great choice song for such a perfect, somber opening. Especially once we go inside the train to meet Victoria Winters, who looks pale and slightly nervous. (that's when the song begins to, quietly whistle, in the background) Aaah! Very nice. Someone was really on the ball here; I love how the music just seems to, float along, with the train as it traveles through the open valley ways. Incredible. Magical. Dreamlike, and, kinda scary. That's the tone that I wished the movie would of stayed with. But,

...if you like tongue in cheek horror movies like 'Death Becomes Her','Eight legged freaks' 'My Demon Lover' 'The Vampire Killers' 'Haunted Honeymoon' and 'Love at First Bite', you'll probably enjoy this. Especially if you don't like your horror, strait up and raw. Like I do.

So, I give 'Dark Shadows' two stars. Mostly because of the opening credits over the train ride, and, Michelle Pfeiffer. She's always a pleasure to watch. She is so hot in Grease 2, it's not even funny!

And, in the meantime, I love you Grayson Hall, and miss you! Thanx for making 'Dark Shadows' a wonderful viewing experience! (even though you often forget your lines) And, oh yeah, long live, 'The House of, and the Night of...Dark Shadow' movies. In my opinion, those films are the real deal. They just came out on DVD.

4977283,4,B00683T5CW,"Barnabas Collins is a vampire from the 18th century whose curse came from a jilted lover who turned out to be a vengeful witch, Angelique Bouchard. Angelique also caused the deaths of Barnabas's parents and his true love, Josette DuPres. And now, when Barnabas is awakened in 1972, he finds Angelique's torture of his family continues. Along with other secret attacks, she has become a wealthy fishing magnate and driven the Collins family out of business. But now that Barnabas is back, he is determined to restore the family honor as the true royalty of Collinsport, Maine. Using his old world charm and vampire gifts, he takes on Angelique in a grudge match to the finish.

As a hardcore Dark Shadows fan, I gotta say, that sounds like a pretty decent movie version of the classic show. Plus, you have a great cast bringing to life many of the classic characters from the 60's/70's, supernatural soap opera and its 90's, nighttime soap revival. Johnny Depp is Barnabas, Michelle Pfeiffer is Elizabeth, Chloe Grace Moretz is Carolyn, and Helena Bonham Carter is Dr. Hoffman, to name a few. Tim Burton's gothic style seems a perfect match, and as I said, the plot SOUNDS excellent. I mean, compare it to the first ever Dark Shadows feature with the original cast. This one has a basic story that does a much better job capturing the story of the TV show than the first film, which was just a typical Dracula type movie. In this one, Barnabas is both good and bad, he battles, and the villain is Angelique, as it should be in a Dark Shadows movie about Barnabas. So, why was this not the PERFECT big budget Dark Shadows movie fans have dreamed of?

Well, personally, I would have aimed for two trilogies. One telling a three part Barnabas story, and the other telling a three part Quentin werewolf story that includes Barnabas (as a vampire and a good guy). This, to me, is the only way to do the show justice on the big screen. Of course, another important note, I would NOT have made them comedies. Let's face it, that was one of the big issues the fans had with this film. It's not that a Dark Shadows comedy is such a bad thing, it's just that Dark Shadows didn't need to resort to that. This could have been such an epic movie-going experience. It has NOT been done before. Not on the bigscreen with a huge budget, cast, and director. This is such a perfect example of missed opportunity. But, bear with me, I am going to speak well of the film too.

But first, let's get more into the negatives. After all, being a comedy doesn't make this a bad film. In truth, it isn't a bad film, it's just not a very good Dark Shadows film. This is not so much because it's a dark comedy, it's because it took far too many liberties to even feel like a true spoof of the original. This film's two biggest problems were an awkward climax and characters that had little in common with the known versions beyond their names and, in some cases, appearances. Yes, Roger and Julia Hoffman were great likenesses of the originals, but they sure weren't playing those characters at all. Why not? I have no idea. Michelle Pfieffer definitely wasn't playing Elizabeth as we have ever known her, nor was Carolyn anything like Carolyn, and I cut Carolyn a lot of slack in this because of her big secret (badly done as it was), which is something I tend to be partial to, and because Chloe Moretz grows more lovely every day. Willie was yet another complete recreation. Fair enough, but I've always said the original Willie was one of the best things that show had going for it, so I don't know why he is turned into more and more of a throwaway, loser character with each version. David was not much like previous Davids either, Mrs. Johnson was a barely moving old woman sight gag, and Barnabas, well, Barnabas... I won't say I didn't like the character Johnny Depp portrayed here, but this wasn't really Barnabas either. Seriously. All I can say is that Angelique was decent (though she got too weird in the climax) and Victoria, well, that character never was much, even though she was important, and she is way more interesting here. At least, her backstory is. It doesn't feel like we really get to spend much getting to know her, though she is definitely a vision to look upon (amazing eyes and love her cutesy outfits). Naturally, having the characters not reflect the originals very much if at all is rather disappointing for fans of the original show. But, besides that, you have moments where you just have to ask, ""Why?"" Was it just to annoy us? I mean, moments like when David refers to Barnabas as ""Uncle Barnabas"" instead of ""Cousin Barnabas"". I mean, we go out of your was to make this is different from the source material as possible? Those are the kinds of choices I never really can get.

Besides that, as I said, there is the issue of a very messy climax. This thing was all over the place, throwing too much at you at once and with some very awkward, at times just plain bad lines and acting. One particular reveal about Carolyn comes with some of the worst dialogue (which poor Chloe had to give) that I've ever heard. I could have gotten totally behind this if weren't for that line, a few complaints about the visuals, and the fact that it really felt thrown in. When you know about it already, you can see the little hints in the film, but they are just a smidge too subtle to not make it feel totally thrown in the first time you see the film. Speaking of the first time you see the film, yeah, it's going to look pretty messy. Once you have seen it already, you can take in everything a bit easier. But the first time, Burton is just trying to throw way too much at you way too fast. A most notable one is the relationship between Doc Hoffman and Barnabas. This is only slightly touched upon here, but it is a big deal when it is (and no, it's not like any fan of the shows would imagine it to be). Basically, if you blink, you can miss things here that come back later, and yet, overall, it feels like only a few things were important to the plot at all. It ends up feeling very random and messy, and it's probably much worse if you are not familiar with the original TV show. Not that this film follows that at all, but, well, at least you will ""get"" some aspects of the Doc Hoffman situation, anyway.

To move onto the flipside though, this film is not a total loss. The bottom line is, it is a lot of fun to watch. Not everyone will think so, I know, but even as a true fan of the previous two TV shows, I do enjoy this film. It has some very funny moments (though some of the jokes are really lame too, like the McDonald's one that I'm sure the filmmakers thought was comedy gold). It does have some awkward scenes, like the love scene that seems to imply sex, though not really..., and the finale that really is a pretty big problem (am I wrong, or is there a big loose end there involving what everyone in town saw and heard?), but it's also got really neat stuff too, like Alice Cooper giving a performance at Collinwood and some of the original Dark Shadows cast members in attendance. There's a lot to be bugged by in this film, but there's a lot to like and enjoy too. The most difficult part is getting past the opening (just after the prologue), in which Victoria is riding a train to Collinwood and ""Nights in White Satin"" is playing. The problem with that scene is, that looks like a completely different and far better film. Actually, that looks like an incredible, amazing Dark Shadows movie! It really emphasizes the missed opportunity here. But, this one, honestly, is still fun. Some moments feel a bit amateurish to be coming from Burton, but a lot of it is just sooo very entertaining, it is hard not to like, even for a fan of the shows. But, it does leave me with concern that now, one of my other top favorite shows, Kolchak the Night Stalker, is on Depp's to do list (so I can't help but wonder if that means Burton too). Honestly, I always hoped to one day make Dark Shadows and Kolchak movies myself, though, I have so many projects on my mind and so little funds that I hardly expect to get to most of them. I enjoy my down time far too much.

Getting to the Blu-Ray (and a key thing to remember is that the ""movie-only"" blu-ray, I hear, does not come with bonus features, so we are forced to pay more for the digital copy and DVD), it naturally looks and sounds gorgeous, so what are the bonus features. Well, I could have hoped for more, but we do get deleted scenes and a nice collection of ""Making Of"" material, though it badly needed a ""Play All"" feature. Also, there is an option to watch the film with even more interviews and behind the scenes footage, including some interviews with original cast members; a pretty nice inclusion. Still, more features could have been had here, from the obvious to the not-so-obvious. The film, when/where I got it came with a slipcover featuring a hologram of Barnabas, though not an interesting, changing one or anything. It's pretty static.

And, that's about it. ""Dark Shadows"", not the movie Dark Shadows fans wanted, not a great Dark Shadows movie, and a very flawed movie in general, but also very unique and fun for both fans and newcomers, and great for the Halloween season. It's worth checking out for some laughs or the lovely ladies, or if you're a Burton fanatic, like so many are. I'm happy to have it in my collection, though don't think it reflects the original or 90's versions at all. And, I know the original show is pretty steep on DVD (like, what, 500 or so for the complete series?), but at the very least, you should check out the 90's show, and that one is probably pretty cheap to buy these days. It was REALLY GOOD, and it's what got me into Dark Shadows to begin with. I was pretty obsessed with it, even though they never got around to the werewolves before it was canceled. What a shame the 2000's version never got picked up! Marley Shelton as Victoria? I would have enjoyed that.",1349481600,3,9989,4.425543478260869

Watch the original series (or my personal fave 1991 series on Hulu or YouTube) to get a glimpse of what Dark Shadows really is.  It's dark, it's atmospheric, moody, gothic, romantic, soapy. Twilight, True Blood, Vampire Diaries all owe a debt to Dark Shadows.  I hope one day someone will bring it back to the small screen as that's where it should be.

4977298,4,B00683T5CW,"This is a great comedy with absolutely great music!

Everybody knows the story. Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is turned into a vampire and locked in a coffin by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) a witch who is in love with him. Barnabas is found 200 years later and released from his coffin. He returns to Collinsport (a town that his father build with his fortune), to take over the dying business of his family. Thankfully he is released in 1972 when the music is great. Imagine him released from the grave in the mid 90's with all the rap music we could have to endure throughout the movie. The film opens with ""Night in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues. You get your money's worth just on the music. The soundtrack of this movie is absolutely FABULOUS.

The performances of Johnny Depp, Eva Green, and Michele Pfeiffer are absolutely stunning. Eva Green is particularly outstanding as always in her role of the mean witch. There is a lot of black humor in the movie and while the end is totally predictable I enjoyed getting there.

If you want to spend two hours enjoying some great acting, great music, and some black, totally British humor (where Alice Cooper is considered to be the ...ugliest woman and the McDonald's sign is the sign of the devil), then this is a movie for you. However, this is not the kind of movie that is going to keep you on the edge of your seat guessing about the ending. The love story of Barnabas appears to be a secodary minor plot.

All this tragedy, all this suffering, came about because a young Barnabas spurned the love of the family maid, Angelique.  Unfortunately for Barnabas, Angelique is unlike most women.  Most women who get spurned simply just suck it up, get depressed, and write poems about it.  But not Angelique.  Angelique knows witchcraft!  She puts together a curse to strike at Barnabas, turning him into a vampire.  Unable to control his urge to suck the life blood from humans, Barnabas eventually gets imprisoned and buried away.  The people of Collinsport eventually got tired of his dining habits, marches up to Collinwood and takes Barnabas into custody.  Driven by Angelique, they imprison Barnabas into a special coffin and buried him deep under ground.  Time marched on and eventually these events were forgotten.

Now, fast forward two hundred years into the future, to the year 1972.  Construction workers accidentally release Barnabas from his coffin.  Still alive, the vampire wakes up from his sleep of two centuries.  Immediately, he makes his way back to Collinwood, and finds the once-glorious mansion in a state of decay and disrepair.  The family fortune has turned for the worse, it would seem.  Barnabas introduces himself to the now dysfunctional Collins family and learns that the once thriving Collins caning plant has been struggling to stay in business. To complicate matters, Barnabas must now learn to adapt to the modern world.  Nevertheless, Barnabas makes a vow to his new family that he will bring the family business back to its former glory, and with it, the family finances. Angelique is still alive, naturally.  And now owns the biggest business in town.

This is actually a pretty good movie.  I'm just not a big fan of Tim Burton's ideas.  I much prefer the Dark Shadows revival of the early 1990s.  Anyway, I do agree with the comedic and light-hearted treatment of the material.  With all of the vampire movies out there (Twilight, True Blood, Underworld, Blade), the last thing Hollywood needed was another stereotypical vampire flick.  So, perhaps this may not have been the right moment to bring out another vampire film.  And if you must do so, you have to be a little different.  And this one certainly is.  Vampires are a dime a dozen in cinema today.  Perhaps Dan Curtis' vision would have been met with lukewarm reception, given the number of vampire exposure on both the big screen and television.  Tim Burton probably felt like he needed to take his movie in another direction.  Given that there were other vampire-themed movies to come out in 2012, from the outlandish ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" to the latest in the ""Twilight"" franchise, it may have been the right thing to do.

Johnny Depp is actually very good as Barnabas.  Eva Green and Michelle Pfeifer were pretty good in their respective roles.  In my view, Chloe Grace Moretz should have been given better material to work with.  She was wasted in this film.  Jack Earle Haley is fine as Willie, but I would have much preferred Steve Buscemi for the role.",1349395200,4,3304,4.865350089766607

With the exceptions of ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Sweeney Todd"", I didn't find Tim Burton had truly made a ""Tim Burton"" film since his ""Sleepy Hollow"" in 1990.

This latest ""Dark Shadows"" based on a popular day-time TV series from the 70's is another half-cooked mess.

4977307,3,B00683T5CW,"Note:  Comparing this movie to the TV serial is really difficult to do since the series had more time to develop the entire Barnabas storyline.  As one of those devoted DARK SHADOWS fanatics who rushed home from school and work to watch the show, Jonathan Frid and Lara Parker are the only Barnabas and Angelique I can fully accept..and none of the subsequent remakes will ever surpass the original.
With that in mind, how does Tim Burton's film stand on its own merits?  One flaw is the tone of the movie - is it a comedy or a straight-on horror flick---or is it both?  Johnny Depp starts off rather foppish and then tries being more sinister and aggressive without any real transitional event to support this change.  Bella Heathcote is a rather passive love interest; Michelle Pfeiffer is quite good as the Collins matriarch, even when she's using a shotgun against the evil Angelique; Burton unwisely restrains Jackie Earle Haley in his role as Willie, a role that would have been more effective had Willie been more uncontrolled; Eva Green chews up the scenery relentlessly but almost becomes comical; Helena Bonham Carter, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloe Jane Moritz are adequate, but their characters seem under-developed.  Burton's visuals are expectedly stunning.  While Danny Elfman's score has its moments, shame on the producers decision not to use the series' haunting theme, especially since both Burton and Depp claimed to be such faithful devotees.  The film's final battle between Depp and Green is an over-the-top CGI slugfest and its final scene between Depp and Heathcote is oh-so TWILIGHTish.  Also the cameos of series regulars Frid, Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby occur so quickly, there easy  to overlook...surely they deserved a bigger moment?  But I have gone back on my word not to compare???  Sorry, just had to include my feelings on those two pet peeves.

I loved Alice Cooper's appearance as well - I was a huge fan of his as a teen.  Probably unusual in the late 80's for a 16-year-old to love Alice Cooper and an old vampire soap opera.  Also unusual - I'm one of the few Johnny Depp fans that doesn't always or automatically appreciate Burton's work (particularly his animated offerings).  I will admit Burton takes on formidable masterpieces and somehow manages to improve upon them.  He not only keeps the soul of the story intact but also deftly deepens and accentuates it.  I absolutely adore Burton's Sweeney Todd (I'd give 6 Stars for that one!) and applaud Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sleepy Hollow, and Alice in Wonderland.

4977310,4,B00683T5CW,"""The heart wants what the heart wants.  Even if that heart is no longer beating,"" might be the theme of this very funny film by Tim Burton.

I used to watch the original series on TV when I was a kid.  And I was hooked, especially when the Barnabas Collins character was introduced.  I tried to watch this series again recently when streaming for it became available, and realized that in reality, the series itself wasn't all that great.  It wasn't really scary enough, and it wasn't really campy enough.  The mistake that they made with the series:  they needed to go one way or the other and they tried to have it both ways, and I believe that it succeeded ultimately at neither.

But Mr. Burton didn't make that mistake.  He decided to mostly take the campy route, and in my opinion, it works.  The spirit of the early 70s was recreated here as well, so that worked.  And the overall acting was very good as well, particularly by Johnny Depp and his nemesis.  But I believe that the writing was the strongest point in this film, since movies such as ""Dark Shadows"" either succeed or fail based upon writing.  Comedic timing by the actors is also important, and I believe that the actors succeeded in that regard.  In particular, there is a scene where an entire Carpenters song is played that is very clever and funny, especially if you're a fan of that excellent group that disbanded too young.

One other item that worked as well:  the special effects.  There is a lot of CGI here, and in a lot of films, the CGI just isn't quite believable.  In ""Shadows,"" differentiating between what is fantasy and what is real is difficult, which is quite a feat.

Pretty big recommendation by me for a film that the critics panned, for some odd reason.  Maybe too many of those critics were too young to have seen the original series, and therefore don't realize that the film is actually better?",1349222400,5,1890,4.519174041297935
4977311,2,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton's take on ""Dark Shadows"" is absolutely bizarre. There's a straightfaced prologue, some excellent period touches, and some truly atmospheric cinematography. Unfortunately, all of this is put into place to serve a truly poorly-thought out film that can't decide what it wants to be and ends up being one disjointed sequence or sketch after another.

Burton's goal seems to have been to create a mashup between ""Austin Powers"" and ""The Addams Family,"" and to be fair there are a few laughs in this film. (I particularly enjoyed the jokes about Alice Cooper, although Alice's cameo isn't that great). I'd be more forgiving of this take on ""Dark Shadows"" if the film were more consistently funny. But it isn't, and maybe the fault lies in the source material itself. ""Dark Shadows"" was undeniably campy but it was never self-consciously funny, and introducing outright comedy into the film adaptation just rings false.

The shame of it is, the cast would have been fantastic in a straight film adaptation or reboot. Johnny Depp in particular would have been the perfect Barnabas Collins.

will not be the ones that made the original endure and endear with all it's charming qualities..
this version has been sanitized of all it's ancestor's imaginative delights, and the tougue so firmly
planted in this films' cheek, quickly dislodged and choked it.  I'm sure there are some
who managed to enjoy this, but personally regret spending the $20.00 for it at Wal-Mart.

4977313,1,B00683T5CW,"This movie was nothing more than a farce. It was definitely NOT Dark Shadows. The crap put into this would have been better served if used in a remake of ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"".  It really felt more like I was watching ""Occupy Collinwood""...There is a huge problem with the scriptwriting here.  In both the original and the Revival series, Angelique wanted Barnabas in order to rise above her station in life. She was a servant, and he was upper crust...In those days the two classes did NOT intermarry.  To gain control she cursed him with her dying breath and made him a vampire (IN THE REAL ONE).  In this one, she doesn't get killed and curses him--she curses him, has him buried alive by an angry mob.

She then takes over Collinsport and destroys the family business--and livlihood--for the most part.  NOW here is the problem with this script: IF she is already running Collinsport, what in the heck does she need Barnabas for?  She does not love him as much as she wants to own him...Sorry but this movie is trash--pure and simple. IF you loved the original don't waste your $.  You only see the original cast members for the time it takes to blink anyhow. I kid you not!",1349222400,16,1187,4.539906103286385
4977314,2,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton takes everything that made the original series so wonderful and trashes it.  I'll admit this is a very beautiful looking film and the cast is for the most part very good but the story is so poorly executed that it simply becomes a CGI spectacle by the time the film lurches to its routine conclusion.  Burton makes some unforgivable errors with the story.  By turning the Collins family into a down on their luck bunch of has beens, turning Collinwood into a dump (and then burning it down), making theCollins family an object of hatred in the town of Collinsport, rather than the respected community institution, and changing the nature of ALL of the characters from the series...it just isn't DARK SHADOWS any more.  Even cameos from original cast members are wasted, as is the appearance by Alice Cooper.  Nothing works.  The entire film has been boiled down to a movie by committee.  You can see all the places where studio execs have had their input and alterations made from endless test screenings. It ends up being another typical bloated Hollywood extravaganza lacking heart, creativity and emotion.  Sincerity and originality are no where to be seen on screen.  I will say that the costumes and set design are gorgeous and if they had been put to use in a film that had an authentic script instead of this cobbled together atrocity they could have really enhanced the film.

Now I'm not just another fan of the series complaining that they changed everything.  When I saw the first trailer for the film I was shocked and delighted to find that the film was a comedy.  I would have been fine with a comic take on the beloved characters.  As it turns out, THE FILM IS NOT REALLY A COMEDY, in fact it seems to have no idea what it is.  ALL of the comic bits were shown in the trailer and the rest of the film is played pretty much as a strange fish out of water horror drama.  The sudden shifts in tone are jarring and mostly obnoxious.  With such a talented cast and gorgeous look, this film is such a missed opportunity that it is depressing.  All of the merits of the film (and there are a lot of them) simply are not enough to save it from an awful script and a wildly self-indulgent director who seems to have run out of original ideas and simply keeps remaking his own tired movies over and over and over again. I doubt I'll see another take on DARK SHADOWS in my lifetime since this one was a failure at the box office and despised by most critics.  Too bad.

The Bluray transfer is fantastic.  Not a flaw to be seen anywhere.  Absolutely beautiful.  I bought the bluray only edition and it has one short documentary as an extra feature.  A pretty bare bones affair in keeping with Warner Bros new ultra cheap standard blu ray releases complete with no artwork on the disc and a bluray case so flimsy it will fall apart if looked at.  Menus are also bare bones (actually a good thing) and the disc loads quickly with no BD live garbage and no forced trailers.  There is a skipable hype trailer trying to persuade us all to dump our current HDTV's and Blu ray players and purchase new 3D equipment so we can watch stellar versions of such classics as GREEN LANTERN and CLASH OF THE TITANS 3D and animated films about penguins.

4977319,4,B00683T5CW,"I had two big surprises when I started watching Dark Shadows. First: the trailer was very misleading. The trailers made this film look as if it was going to be a complete comedy. Much to my delight, the film was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. While I have no problem with comedies, I felt that making this a completely comedic film would not do justice to the original Dark Shadows TV show, in which the comedic elements were not its main draw.

The second surprise for me was that this felt like an older Tim Burton film. Now when I say that, I mean it feels like a return to his more macabre films than his recent output. Burton has always been at his best in my mind when dealing with horror elements, such as Sleepy Hollow or even Ed Wood. He draws on classic horror films and plays with their tropes. He hasn't been doing this as much recently with the exception of Sweeney Todd. Other than that he's been doing more family friendly films (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland come to mind) which don't capture the feel of his older films. There's nothing wrong with trying something new, but this is a return to classic Burton.

The film works fairly well. The funny bits are funny and the scary bits are... well, I guess they could unnerve some people. Burton's usual color scheme is in effect, so expect a lot of dark colors with red highlights. The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, as the shots tend to be very much in the style of old Hammer Horror films (Horror film buffs should keep an eye out for shots that resemble some of your old favorites). The soundtrack is a nice mix of Danny Elfman's score and 70s rock. This is used to great effect throughout the movie (most notably Nights in White Satin).

The film is not Burton's best, nor is it Depp's (Both of which would be Ed Wood in my opinion). It is an entertaining film, nothing particularly special... but there's a sense of nostalgia to it... Both for fans of the show and old Burton fans.

4977321,2,B00683T5CW,"*revised with possible spoilers*

When I first heard that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were collaborating in making a Dark Shadows movie, I squealed like the biggest fan girl ever. Being both a huge fan both Burton and Depp while being a fan of Dark Shadows, I thought I was getting the best of both worlds. When I started to see production photos slowly coming out, I thought they got it spot on, until that trailer came out... Disco music, comedy, really? Still, I went this past Friday into the movie with no expectations..... And lets just say it's not the Dark Shadows your mother grew up with.

The movie starts out great with an original story line from the show. Barnabas Collins and his family create Collinwood and Collinsport. He then spurns the love a servant girl named Angelique and falls in love with another girl by the name of Jossette. Angelique, being a witch, curses both of them. Jossette falls to her death and Barnabas is turned into a Vampire. He is then locked away in a chained coffin by angry mod, led by Angelique.

Fast forward 200 years. Collinwood and Collinsport still stand. The Collins family still endure with only a couple members remaining: Elizabeth Stoddard and her daughter Caroline, Elizabeth's brother Roger and his son David. There's Willy Loomis, their groundskeeper, Mrs. Johnson, a maid (who served no purpose but to stand around and pretend to be an old crazy person), Dr. Julia Hoffman, David's always drunken slosh psychiatrist, and soon they're joined by Victoria Winters (aka Maggie Evans) who comes on as David's governess. Already, Vicki's character is pushed into the wayside many times in the film, although you would assume she would have a bigger part as being the reincarnation of Jossette. She only appears when it suits Barnabas' scenes.

Depp's Barnabas awakens in 1972 by a construction crew building a Mcdonalds. Already starts the downfall from here. Instead of being the serious Barnabas in the opening of the film, Depp plays him as a bumbling fool, all wigged out about all the ""weird"" things he sees along the way (the giant glowing McDonalds M, cars, lava lamps, etc.) In the television show, Barnabas had put Willy under control and then seemingly planted himself in place with no issues and charm the Collins family in letting him stay at Collinwood. Never did they know he was a vampire either, as they spill in this movie.

Another character dynamic they got all wrong was that of Dr. Hoffman. In the television show, she was a doctor that dealt with studying blood diseases, thus trying to always cure Barnabas of his curse. She was always the voice of concern and did develop a friendship with Barnabas. Helena Carter's portrayal is far from the loving doctor we know, where she is constantly drunk, uses sexual favors to get what she wants and instead of finding a cure for Barnabas, she has other plans on how to use his blood.

You find out later on that the Collins are almost broke due to another company called Angel Bay. You can see where this is going. Angel could be short for Angelique maybe? Eva Green did Lara Parker a grave injustice by portraying Angelique as some sad, desperate slut who happens to be a witch. Hilarity ensues, there's conflict, and a big climatic ending.

My biggest beef with this film is while it made many references to the television show, Burton and Depp had made this more of a campy comedy rather than a serious soap opera. Granted the television show was know for it's very campy drama and occasional bloopers in scenes. But it still managed to be serious when it needed to be. I think the biggest mistake was to let Seth Grahame-Smith (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) write the screenplay. He's know for writing humorous spoofs and that's what he did with this. Sure it had it's moments, but to do that through out the entire movie was a mistake. Another thing that was wrong was all the ""surprises"" they made. Caroline turns into a werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling not only her mom to ""deal with it,"" but her face faces the audience, expecting us to ""deal with it"" as well. Okay sorry, I wanted to cry foul and not deal it. It was lame delivery with an even lamer surprise.

As a stand alone film (not comparing to the show), I felt it was really bad. It's not Burton/Depp's best work (in comparison to others they have made). It would be last on my Burton/Depp list. The ending was rushed and almost laughable, especially the whole werewolf scene. Most of the theater was busting in nervous and ridiculous laughter. I feel Johnny Depp overacted (as with most of the other actors, mostly Eva Green). Granted most of the characters he does are over the top, but he took this to the next extreme. As briefly stated, the serious scenes did not match the funny ones.

The only thing rewarding about this film was the performances of Jackie Earl Haley (Willie) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth). Even Belle Heathcote (Victoria) had a great performance, it's a shame they didn't give her more to work with.

Out of all the Burton/Depp movies, this one was my least favorite. That's very hard to say, considering I love all of the films they've made over the years. It had so much potential, but they ruined it. I prefer my cheezy soap opera. It's like they made 2 different movies, one serious and one humorous. They should've worked more on it, made it serious and released it on Halloween. Would've been more fitting that way.",1349136000,9,5449,4.690376569037657
4977322,5,B00683T5CW,"People are taking this movie way too seriously. Everybody needs to watch this movie as it's meant to be watched. It's sheer entertainment. It's more of a homage to the TV series ( which was really bad. You can see booms and cameras in shots, actors would bump their heads in doorways, they'd forget their lines, etc.). LIGHTEN UP!!",1349136000,6,331,4.627118644067797
4977323,3,B00683T5CW,"My review here is inspired by the myriad opinions being voiced about this movie, opinions which are highly bifurcated. Many people want to defend the movie entirely or lambast it in full with little room in between. I would like to join the vocal minority who believe this movie is neither dark nor light, but a shade of grey.

This film does something that few filmmakers in Hollywood would ever dare to do: it attempts to capture the magic of a soap opera, and one that lasted the better part of a decade, in a 2-hour film. This has been attempted before, specifically with Dark Shadows. ""House of Dark Shadows"" worked at the time, and still feels good for long-time fans of the series, but newcomers are often left feeling that they missed something. They did - the entire rest of the series. A good soap opera never has just one plot - it has many which arch over multiple episodes/seasons, or wrap around each other, or come and go...it is maddening to try and follow. To boil down the essence of a series like that into a single film is a ludicrous task. But they did it, and good for them for trying. It is ambitious, and I respect that.

Going into ""Dark Shadows,"" one needs to keep this in mind: Burton and crew attempted to take the most popular story arc from the series, Barnabas's curse and his feud with Angelique, and distill it into a stand-alone plot. But, being who they are, the filmmakers could not ignore the source material entirely. What we end up with is a solid plot which is constantly interrupted by smaller, less poignant plots which are related to the main plot (though some are more related than others). That is exactly what the series did, only it did it over the course of years, not a couple hours. Having watched the series, I know that there are some subplots worth skipping. This movie felt the same way - I really liked the main plot but I could have done without some of the sidebars.

All this makes the film hard to swallow for viewers. Some viewers wanted a film slavishly devoted to the source material and others wanted a pure-bred Burton horror/comedy. What we all got was something in between. When this movie gets dark, it gets dark. When it gets goofy, it gets goofy. These two halves don't exactly blend together, and instead we get an oil/water effect - they never blend into the perfect mixture but neither does one detract from the other. They just sort of coexist together. Some people want the movie to pick a side: either be a pure comedy (which would have felt insulting to the source material and its fans) or a pure horror (which runs the risk of taking its dark side too seriously the way ""Dark Shadows: The Revival"" did). What we should do is take it for what it is. You may not like everything about it, but maybe you'll like more than you expected.

Confused yet? Yeah, sorry, but this is a weird movie to describe while remaining neutral. And be sure, I am neutral. I didn't hate this movie like I thought I would, but neither am I willing to run out and pay $20 for a new copy. I'm going to wait for the price to drop, then I'll consider it.

Would I recommend this movie? Yes, but only to open-minded DS fans, Burton fans, and the occasional horror/comedy fan. I don't think most people will feel connected to this story, but maybe they will connect with just enough of it to see it as an acceptable popcorn flick. If you feel like you want to give it a chance, do so. Otherwise, leave it alone and find something else. It isn't a movie to watch unless you really feel like you should.

On a side note, my mother was a die-hard fan of the show back in the 60s. I took her to see this movie opening weekend and she really liked it, more so than I did. She took it for what it was and said to me afterwards, ""It was like watching a miniature series, like I just watched an entire season in one sitting. I hope they make a sequel."" And she dislikes everything Burton or Depp does. Take that evidence for what you will. I know other die-hard fans who despised it. You never know...",1349136000,6,4042,4.375499334221039
4977324,3,B00683T5CW,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought...ah hah!  Johnny Depp and Tim Burton do Dark Shadows, great!  But then the trailers came out and I wondered if they had flubbed it all up.  I was prepared to be disappointed big time.

That being said, I went to the movie after all and enjoyed quite a bit of it.  Much much more than I expected to.  Yes, it had little to do with the tone of the original series (which I also loved) and some of the humor fell flat on occasion.  But the overall look to the movie was fabulous and many of the scenes were really really funny, mostly those that involved Barnabus having to deal with the 1970's.  Well, and some of the scenes were just funny because of looking back at the 1970's in general.

Basically, once I stopped expecting it to be the old classic Dark Shadows, I enjoyed it for what it was.  It's like the difference between reading the Sookie Stackhouse books and watching True Blood--they are both different and both good in their own light, but you can't go into them expecting them to be exactly the same.

I wouldn't say this is the best movie Johnny Depp or Tim Burton have ever done, but it was worth going to see and is worth owning if you want something a bit dark, a bit strange, and a bit campy.  It also made me want to run out and get a lava lamp...",1349136000,3,1314,4.191235059760956

By the time I got around to seeing it by myself, it was already gone. Lucky me though: it was available to watch on a flight a couple of weeks ago. I like Tim Burton well enough and I love Johnny Depp so I was expecting to be ""meh"" about it. I was most certainly *not* expecting to love it as much as I did.

For starters, it's beautiful. The costumes by the fabulous Colleen Atwood are gorgeous. The people - Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Bella Heathcote, et al. - are gorgeous, as are the hair and make-ups. The sets are gorgeous. Secondly, the humor is awesomely stupid and deadpan (""I'm pretty sure he called me a hooker."" ""This is a very silly play."" ""Ugliest woman I've ever seen."" - hahaha!!) And I thought Johnny Depp was terrifically silly. I adored Barnabas. And the music. And all the Brits playing Americans. Of Burton's films, I'd say this is the most like the fabulous Sleepy Hollow, which I also loved.

It's not in the least bit deep and doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Clearly it's not for everyone, and I wonder if people would have given it more of a chance if it had NOT been a Tim Burton film!",1349136000,5,1305,4.366255144032922

I measured when, for me the thing began to fall apart- 101:13. It was around there when the writer went to a movielover's subtext to maintain the narrative of the film. Movielover's subtext? Vampires represent the oppressive feudal lords of europe, bleeding their peasants dry with oppressive logic which claims their lifelong debt to their feudal lord.  The writer picks up this subtext in earnest around 101:13 and tries to play with it, toggling between camp and brainy fun in the background. You know the script is in trouble when it drags out Alice Cooper to hot things up at 1:26:08. Sure, there are some vague hints toward the philosophical  subtext of the entire vampire genre, but the feints are not clear, instead, shrouded in campy reference which clouds the reason behind the gag. The end, though, returns to victorian camp, with generous footage of slashing, splashing waves and a weepy part which gives heart to the conclusion. So, at the end, from 1972, there is a return to the romantic sentiment of 1876. Debatable as to which is more heartfelt.",1349136000,4,1246,4.790697674418604
4977328,2,B00683T5CW,"Be very aware that there is alot of Vampire fans out there, and a lot of Johnny Depp fans, and seeing Johnny Depp as a vampire is a wet dream for those kind of fans. So expect to see a lot of 5 star reviews that would give the movie top scores on the mere fact that such and such have been put together for the first time. I on the other hand am no fan of Vampire movies, especially ones that sparkle, nor is Johnny Depp a favored actor of mine: so let me be brutally honest when I tell you this movie is really getting overrated reviews from women who just enjoyed seeing one actor of the world play a role that is being done to death lately.

The plot is about a wealthy and respected guy (Johnny Depp) who wouldn't fall in love with a witch. So the witch casts a spell on the guys girlfriend to throw herself off of a cliff. The guy plummets after her, only to find the witch has cursed him to be a vampire. The witch then exposes him as a vampire and the town go after him with pitchforks and torches to bury him in the ground forever. 100 or so years later, his coffin is dug up and he returns to his mansion to find his decedents are living there. He introduces himself, but only the mother of the clan, played by Michelle Pheiffer, understands that he is actually the vampire guy who he says he is.

The vampire then ends up living with the family and some almost humorous moments take place as the vampire meets and greets new people and talks of vampire things he does, before Michelle Pheiffer steps in and throws them off track by making up an explanation to hide the fact he is a vampire. These scenes could have been much funnier, but look like they where just added in at last minute to try and make some humor for the rest of the mostly dull and boring dialog.

The witch who first cursed the guy is still alive too, and she finds out about his return and confronts the guy, and says he must either join her corporation of selling fish, or he will spend another century buried in a tomb. The guy still does not love her, even tho he gives her a vampire vs witch love making scene that failed to be funny, but then says he still doesn't love her, instead he is in love with someone who looked like his former girlfriend. Played by a not-so pretty woman who hardly appears or speaks in the film, it was done horribly wrong to care about.

Besides the mother character of Pheiffer, she also has a cheating husband, an annoying 70's style emo daughter, a dork of a kid for a son who rips off the kid from Jurassic park and Jumanji too much, and a nanny who see's dead people. The witch threatens to hurt the kids if the guy doesn't do what she wants, and of coarse, he refuses and the battle is on.

By the time the movie ends, it felt rushed, and things seemed thrown in at last second. I won't spoil it for you, but I will say this which will make more sense if you see the part in general... what the hell was with the werewolf thing? It made no sense, was pointless and a stupid idea.

The only decent part of this movie was the appearance of Alice Cooper. Playing an intro to Schools Out, into No More Mr Nice Guy and then Balled of Dwight Fry. However, almost ruined when the music is turned down to hear boring ""is it my breath"" dialog of a 100 year old vampire trying to kiss someone who looks 17 years old who see's dead people.

Why can't vampire legend be left as it was? Why does this one try to give up drinking blood to fit into the times, look like a bad emo version of Aston Kutcher, and be dead, but have enough blood in his body to keep his heart going to actually get an erection? If the heart doesn't pump blood, no way will that happen... but yet, this guy manages to accept some oral enjoyment from a character in the movie... yeah, just, wouldn't happen if vampires did exist. Sorry ladies, but if Johnny was a vampire, he'd be useless to you in that area, so quit fantasizing about it :P

Some parts of the movie where funny, but not all that memorable, so I wouldn't even call this movie ""dark humor""... thats just something people say when Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make films together... but, it's not what I would call dark. Sorry, but dark humor is not humor played out in a night-time setting.

Overall, worthy of a rental, but not to keep and watch again if you are not obsessed with certain actors or the role they are playing. But beware, the ending is is as rushes and stupid as possible and makes little to no sense.

The film performed poorly in studios but will no doubt do good business on Blu-ray and DVD since the holiday season puts people in the mood to see something spooky and kooky to celebrate. ""Dark Shadows"" is perfect for viewers who want to get the chills and some thrills but not overdose on them. A good helping of humor helps to balance things out.

The vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to his home town of Collinsport after being locked up in a coffin for two centuries. He discovers the witch Angelique (Eva Green) who cursed him is alive and well. The small fishing town his father founded is now under her control. Barnabas must find a way to restore his family name to its rightful glory. He also longs to be free of his curse and the hunger for blood it causes him to have. At the same time, a new visitor (Bella Heathcote) to Collinswood resembles his lost love from centuries before. Could she be the reincarnated woman he's longed for so long?

""Dark Shadows"" has the same perfect blend of sophisticated and unrefined humor we've come to expect from director Tim Burton. You could say it's a blend of ""Beetlejuice"" comicality and the gothic seriousness of ""Sleepy Hollow."" Most of the comedy comes thanks to Depp's portrayal of the ""out-of-time"" Barnabas being exposed to 1972 culture and technology. That's not to say the horror and supernatural elements are put on the back burner. They're very much present and play a big part in the movie.

The high-definition transfer of ""Dark Shadows"" is stunning. All the darks colors stand out in contrast and Burton's beautifully gloomy color schemes shine through nicely. Helena Bonham Carter's red hair dances across the screen clashing with the grey scenery around her. It also brings out all the nooks and crannies of the old Collinswood mansion.

The 5.1 surround sound mix spreads out all the creepy sounds, creaks, crashing waves, and Danny Elfman's masterful score throughout the speakers. It will heighten the viewing experience in a home theater.

Special features included in the Blu-ray edition consist of Maximum Movie Mode, Focus Points, and deleted scenes. Maximum Movie Mode gives us picture-in-picture commentary from Tim Burton, cast, and crew about different facets of the movie. 37-minutes of Focus Points are broke up into different featurettes entitled ""Becoming Barnabas,"" ""Welcome to Collinsport,"" ""The Collinses: Every Family Has Its Demons,"" ""Reliving a Decade,"" ""Angelique: A Witch Scorned,"" ""Alice Cooper Rocks Collinsport,"" ""Dark Shadowy Secrets,"" ""A Melee of Monstrous Proportions"" and ""'Dark Shadows:' The Legend Bites Back."" Five deleted scenes round out the bonus material.

I think if people give ""Dark Shadows"" a chance on Blu-ray or DVD, they'll discover an entertaining Tim Burton film that celebrates the television show many of us grew up watching. It's one of the best examples of a movie where the directors and stars successfully poke fun at the unintended campiness of its source material while being reverent to it at the same time. If you're a fan of Burton, his ensemble casts, and / or Johnny Depp, ""Dark Shadows"" is a must-see.",1348790400,5,3287,5.010989010989011

4977334,4,B00683T5CW,"I don't know much about the original series of Dark Shadows, but after watching this movie it has made me question if I should consider it. First off, I love Tim Burton + Johnny Depp + Helena Bonham-Carter flicks like this. I'm not expecting it to be an epic script, yet I get the odd sense of humor those 3 + the other characters throw into every TB movie. The music was awesome, and I loved the Alice Cooper cameo. I like to diversity of the actors too. Eva Green was so far my favorite, even though she pissed me off through out the entire film, I thought she played Angelique perfectly! The story was fun and enjoyable, but I don't suggest you bring your children to watch this movie, thus the PG-13 rating. I give it a 4/5 because as some points things became slow/dull yet I was still entertained with the script.

I don't understand why people would give this movie a 1/5 stars and think it's ""completely trash to the original"". As far as I heard, the original is boring, dull, and slow. Tim Burton mentioned it wasn't completely true to the original, and quite frankly I think he made it better for today's audience. The acting was suppost to be bad, to match the 1970's feel for that era in TV series. I'd love to see the original series after this movie cause I think it would be funny. So in my eyes, I don't think Dark Shadows has made any harmful stab to the original, I think they helped it become more recognized.

I recommend you see this movie and keep an open mind and plenty of patience. :)",1348617600,4,1509,4.309859154929577
4977335,3,B00683T5CW,"Maybe it's because I knew this remake of the old Dan Curtis TV series was ""Tim Burton on auto-pilot"" that I dialed my expectations down accordingly. Whatever the case may be, the 2012 ""Dark Shadows"" is an imperfect but -- surprisingly -- intermittently charming film that reaffirms how good an actor Johnny Depp can be.

The star's performance as Barnabas Collins - a Maine vampire who awakens in the early `70s after having slept for over 200 years, only to find his ancestors on the downturn and his hated rival (a witch played by Eva Green) having overtaken their place in the community - absolutely anchors a sometimes chaotic and under-written (or is it over-written?) Seth Grahame-Smith screenplay that has too many supporting players running around to little or no effect. Yes, Depp's Barnabas is still ""quirky"" yet the actor retains enough of his aristocratic origins to make the part not just a rehash of the ""colorful"" characters the actor has been essaying of late; he's fascinating, alternately sinister and sympathetic, and the fish-out-of-water material, while not as dominant as the movie's advertising campaign suggested, provides some of the film's more entertaining aspects.

The movie does fumble countless dramatic possibilities -- so much of it seems overstuffed and yet undercooked, between Barnabas' weakly drawn relationship with the younger Collins clan (Chloe Grace Moretz's part is close to a throwaway; after prominently establishing her early on, Bella Heathcote's role as the reincarnation of Barnabas' lost love disappears almost completely, resurfacing just in time for the climax), to his confrontation with Green, who turns in an unsatisfying performance (her affected American accent sounds more like she's from Texas as opposed to a witch who's lived in Maine for over two centuries). Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earle Haley, and, of course, Helena Bonham Carter also appear in roles that never seem to serve the dramatic purpose that they should have.

It seems evident here that Burton didn't apply himself as much to his craft as usual -- despite using familiar personnel like production designer Rick Henrichs and costume designer Colleen Atwood, the picture has a glossy, ""digitized"" appearance unlike his past works -- and even Danny Elfman's score often takes a backseat to a parade of familiar, effectively utilized period pop tunes. Yet there's just something infectious about ""Dark Shadows"" when it does score -- particularly in several amusing moments of offbeat humor (Barnabas pounding his head against an electric organ; Alice Cooper showing up to perform at a Collins family party) and through Depp's winning performance. Though still one of Burton's weaker outings all told, it's at least livelier than the moribund ""Alice in Wonderland"" and should find a receptive genre audience this Halloween season on video.

Warner's Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultraviolet combo pack offers a clear 1080p transfer, with Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography utilizing a striking pallet of colors throughout. The DTS MA soundtrack is effective and extras include just five minutes of deleted scenes (mostly involving Barnabas' relationship with the modern Collins family - material that there should've been more of in the final cut) and ""Maximum Movie Mode"" behind-the-scenes ""focus points.""",1348617600,6,3310,5.396518375241779

There were some priceless moments, and some great scenes. The scene where Barnabas and Angelic get it on is great. but I think the script could have been better. It was uneven in places, slow in places, and failed to develop things when it had the opportunity.

The video around the Karen Carpenter song was great, funny, and accomplished a lot in the story. However, the appearance by Alice Cooper could have been used more, and seemed like a lost opportunity.

The trailers give the impression that this is a camp comedy, which it isn't. So if that is the movie you are expecting this isn't Adam's Family.  There are some funny bits, but they seem to be thrown in somewhat randomly.",1348185600,4,886,4.553459119496855

Tim Burton is dark and quirky and Depp has ability to pull off even the srangest of characters and make them come alive for the viewer.  I also have never seen the TV show.  I didn't even know there was a TV show until a couple weeks ago.

With that in mind, I have to say that while Dark Shadows isn't my absolute favorite of Burton and Depp's work, it definitely a classic Burton movie and well worth the money.  The visuals are dark and fascinating.  The costumes are as beautiful as always.  The actors are just quirky enough to make the charater interesting and make the viewer feel empathetic towards the character.  The script was very funny.

  I always found the Addams Family film to be fun despite a thin plot and with Dark Shadows the plot is much thinner and not as near as enjoyable. I only give it a positive review since Burton at least handles the 70's setting well even if he could have done more with it. While Depp is of course ingenious in the lead role. Still, as a Burton film it's his weakest since Planet of the Apes and it would be nice if we got more of the Burton who did greats like BeetleJuice, EdWood, Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish and Sweeny Todd.",1348099200,5,937,4.171270718232044

4977351,3,B00683T5CW,"Let me start out with the BAD:

1.  Dark Shadows is just not meant to be a movie.  Even Dan Curtis' own attempts at Dark Shadows films, House of Dark Shadows and Night of Dark Shadows (both of which are nowhere near as good as Burton's film)are unmemorable, watered down versions of the television show.  Sure, the production values were much more substantial and the actors actually had the luxury of multiple takes, but the unexplainable magic of the television series was lost.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have made a valiant effort to capture the uncanny appeal of Dark Shadows, but I am sad to say that they failed.  But it's not their fault, and this particular failure is a truly beautiful failure with many moments of brilliance, such as Victoria's arrival in Collinwood as ""Nights In White Satin"" plays.  And Caroline's sexy dance to Donovan's ""Season Of The Witch.""  Nearly all of Johnny Depp and Eva Green's on-screen moments.  But a two hour long film is simply far too compressed for the completely unique dimension that is Dark Shadows.  With an endless stream of characters, plot lines, and subtle moods, Dark Shadows needs to move at its own slow pace over a very long period of time.  All of the performances are great, but we never get to explore Victoria's past or see her intimately involved with Barnabas.  We do not get a chance to understand David's troubled mind.  We know absolutely nothing about Roger.  These characters offer substantial intrigue, but it is never explored and fleshed out.  The film, simply by virtue of being a film, is too compressed.

2.  Then there is the ending.  There was a large explosion, fire, some ridiculous Matrix-style fighting that we see far too often these days, and the introduction of a werewolf that came out of absolutely nowhere!  Storytelling has never been Burton's forte, and endings are often very difficult, but it's really hard to make apologies for this film's final sequences.

The real shame here is that this film is not a TV pilot, because it would make for one of the greatest TV pilots ever!  If Burton, Depp, and the others would have channeled their efforts into an ongoing TV series, the many brilliant aspects of the film could have the opportunity to flourish!

OK, so now on to the GOOD:

Based on the bad qualities I have highlighted, I probably give the impression that I hated the film.  But, I did not!  In fact, I really enjoyed it!  I haven't had as much fun in a movie theater in many years.  I doubt that the film will remain in theaters very long or make a huge impact on audiences, but the truth is that it's so much better than 99% of the other stuff out there.  In fact, it's a bit too good.  And that is why it will probably fade away.

1.  While the horrible promotional trailers for the film showcased the ""humorous"" aspects of the film and lead audiences to believe that the film was essentially a camp-fest littered with corny jokes and obnoxiously bad editing, I am pleased to report that the opposite is true!  While there are certainly elements of black humor, they do not dominate the film, and they work much better in the context of the actual film than in the misleading trailers.  In fact, the black humor that made me cringe in the trailers was actually one of the best elements of the film.  As with most Burton films, the ""humor"" is done with a perfect balance of melancholy and deliciously strange perverseness that one can only describe as ""Burtonesque.""

2.  The romance is there.  The theme of ""love beyond time"" is central to the storyline, even if it could have been fleshed out even more.  Some have said that the romance between Barnabas and Victoria seems disingenuous, but in fairness, it is not a new love.  Victoria is the reincarnation of Barnabas' fiancee, Josette DuPres.  But I do think that there should have been more romantic outings between Barnabas and Victoria.

3.  By Tim Burton standards, this was not a special effects-heavy movie.  The beautiful costumes and sets were just as important as the actors, and you could really feel the haunting spirit of the Collins mansion.

4.  The sexual tension between Angelique and Barnabas is hot!  They nailed it.  Eva Green is the sexiest woman alive, and no one else could have played Angelique so perfectly.  I have always thought that Angelique was Barnabas' true love, but he was too proud of his status to accept a woman with such fiery sexuality and lowly status.  His torment really came from the fact that he could not admit that he actually loved her.  And the script got this essential point right.

5.  Johnny Depp!  His performance was perfect.  He captured the essence of the character, and I am sure that the late Jonathan Frid would be proud.  Frankly, Depp's performance rivals the film as a whole.

Final Thought:  While not a masterpiece, this is a very good film, and I have never seen anything like it.  The casting is perfect, even if the characters didn't get a fair chance to develop and shine.",1348012800,7,4996,4.651029748283753

Is it worth seeing.  Oh yeah.  But it is not worth seeing if you have preconceived notions about exactly what Dark Shadows was or should be, almost 45 years on.  This is no soap opera, produced on a string and started as a daytime television experiment, which outlasted it's shelf life by about 2 years.  Burton's version is a well developed camp comedy, chock full of double entendres and dynamite characters.  The actors in this picture are obviously having a riot, chewing up the scenery like a bunch of manic piranhas.

The secret to this film's success is that it takes the metaphor and irony of the original soap opera to it's camp zenith.  Half of the fun of the soap opera was the production 'on the cheap' and all of the errors that went with it.  Even as 12 year olds, we screamed with laughter at the collapsing scenery, head-bonking boom mike and Joan Bennett's glassy-eyed, forgotten dialogue.  Though Burton's production is anything but cheap, he breathes the original improbability of the entire situation into every frame and makes the most of every minute, while maintaining the original's plot.

Those looking for a literal version of the original cheesy production need only see the revival produced in the 90's and not bother with this.  You won't get it and more importantly, won't like it.  This is a Tim Burton picture and not a 'Dan Curtis Production'.  It's meant to be fun and dark, unexpected and provocative, witty and dry.  For those of us who embraced the horrendous improbability of what was Dark Shadows, when we were 6th graders, Burton gives us the hilarious memories sans the forced maudlin drama of daytime TV or a serious rendition of a camp classic.  Anything like that would've died a wrenching death.

There could've been nothing worse than making this amazing story a 'True Blood' or 'Twilight' redux, which was a petrifying possibility if anyone besides Burton had gotten ahold of the property.

What keeps the movie from being a complete disaster is the director's uncanny sense of character complexity, and compelling, mind burning visuals.  This is not a film whose plotting begs for the type of analysis of Mann's ""Heat"" or Hegeland's ""L.A. Confidential.""  It's the product of an acutely artistic mind devoted to fetish, obsession, and aberrant personalities at odds with other aberrant personalities.  Lucky for us, that mind has a bizarre and enthralling sense of humor too!  Disparaging word-of-mouth, combined with a terribly misguided trailer, may have dissuaded many from seeing this little gem, but don't let it stop you from having a good time.  The movie is rife with stunning, atmospheric visuals, and strange, delightful comedy.  ""Dark Shadows"" continues Burton's fascination with ""misunderstood monsters,"" and here time and a curse have turned Barnabas Collins into an anachronism.  Fine performances by all the pincipals and supporting cast also lend a hand in tethering the rambling story to some form of logic.  I will agree with those who were disappointed the movie didn't take greater pains to polish the script and impart those fine, finishing touches that could have elevated the material beyond its pulpy origins.  But the end result is still a compelling horror fairy tale with wonderful acting, engaging humor, brilliant visuals, and offbeat comedy.  If you view ""Dark Shadows"" more as an eccentric, yet beloved, family member, its imperfections and quirks begin to have a spellbinding charm of their own.",1346976000,6,1706,5.352059925093633

4977372,5,B00683T5CW,"Keep in mind I will on purpose keep many spoilers out of this review on purpose. Who wants to see or buy a film that has had every moment ruined and hashed out for them. So having said that let me say, I LOVED THIS FILM. I was very against this film due to the trailer but I am glad I went and saw it in theatres because I was begging for more by the end of the film. This film does indeed have spell to cast, one that is magical, and totally Burton. Yet this Burton film is very much like those of 'ole in that it falls in vein with Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Sweeney Todd. From the first chords of the films opening song---NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN--I was totally hooked. Let me also state that I find it ironic that fans of the orginal show---not all--but some ---hate this film---when in turn the stars of the original show---which some appear in this film---gave the film not only thumbs up but also their blessing. Now isn't that ironic? The film does follow the premise of the original show but with some new liberties and tweaks, and I was amazed to realize that salutes in certain scenes to the films HALLOWEEN, CARRIE, and THE SHINING all which not only influenced a generation but also Burton as a filmmaker. I would definitely suggest this to any film lover, fan of the show, and anyone who is looking for a vampire style film that is not Twilight and is not a gore fest. I truly am suprised that this film did not do better. But I think the studios should never have advertised this as a comedy because it is not. Like other serious films and even horror films, there is some funny moments, which lighten the mood, but it seems once you are smiling and laughing something happens to give you pause and shudder at the dark light of what has just occurred. Give this film a chance. The acting is top notch. The film's capture of the era is pitch perfect. The only sad thing is that Burton has said he will not make a sequel which this film was a set up for grand and great series or even a trilogy of films. But who knows what will happen. I will say, disregard the negative fan base reviews, especially if you are a fan of the genre, Burton, or just love movies. Oh and yes let's not forget the Depp fans, this is one of his best films. So definitely buy it. Love this movie.",1346630400,8,2296,4.244292237442922

Dreadful. Now that's a word I don't hear or use very often. But dang, it's the most appropriate term for this silly train wreck of a flick.

Admittedly, I'm not a fan of auteur director Tim Burton. But this, this would be bad regardless of whatever name was attached to it. Had he adopted a pseudonym like say, John Smith, I would be here saying that Director Smith had pooped out a turd and called it a movie.

Not sure if Hollywood has yet figured out that Burton's visionary talent is monochromatic astigmatism with a dash of delusional creativity. Like a street performer - while initially fascinating and providing a momentary diversion, quickly loses steam as one gets bored by the repetitive drone. You've seen it all before. The man is the definition of a one-string banjo with a bucket of white face paint and mobile airbrush on the side.

Depp's vampire-outside-his-own-time bit quickly grows tiresome and honestly doesn't make the best use of the material. There were a multitude of lost opportunities as Burton went for the cheap easy laughs, failing to exploit anachronisms to their maximum potential. Sadly, there were only a few moments of pure cleverness. One of the best as Barnabus makes a quiet sideways inquiry on meeting the young Collins daughter Carolyn for the first time, to which she replies in a wonderful deadpan, ""I think he called me a hooker."" Unfortunate that there weren't more of those.

The one performance I found enjoyable - Eva Green. To me, she struck the right balance of zesty campiness, sincere wickedness and forlorn love warped into vicious jealousy. Previously she's always taken the quiet, often low-key approach to her characterizations. But as witch Angelique, the funny comedienne emerged from her more established cool sensual persona. Fun and tasty, I like to think this role will broaden her appeal to differing filmmakers.

The worst aspect of this production was that the entire film lacked cohesiveness. Various components patched together with no sense of a greater theme; scenes and cast that were disconnected and unfinished.

Examples of script incongruity:

- Victoria states she was always returning to Collinswood and back to Barnabas. When does she ""always return"" to the township? It's never explained. And that when she returns, it's always to him. Wasn't he stuck in a coffin all her life? So... <shrug>

- Another quagmire: How many ghosts inhabit the manor? Two apparently. There's the original Josette who haunts her modern incarnation Victoria. Then suddenly, and conveniently without any explanation, young David's mother appears in a pathetic deus ex machina cheat to save the day. Confusingly, neither interacts with the other. 'Natch, since we're only introduced to the other spirit toward the very end of the film.

- Carolyn's lycanthropy. No seeming point to this other than as a hurried prop thrown into this weak monster bash. All that was missing was ol' Bolt Neck.

Stuff like this irks since we're left trying to make sense out of the senseless; pressed to make our own mental jigsaw by forcing the various pieces to fit.

Lack of directorial oversight and ignoring simple internal story logic.

Mostly, I feel bad for the hardcore Dark Shadows fans. Can't begin to imagine their disappointment, frustration and anger. And in truth, if I were part of any iconic cultural heritage, and the name Tim Burton was suddenly mentioned in conversation, I'd be very, very scared. The man has the unfortunate black thumb of moviemakers looking to plumb the cultural bank. Planet Of The Apes, Mars Attacks, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory - the list of smoking craters and salted fields goes on and on.

My spouse said I had this look of pure disgust through-out the whole thing... except when I managed a giggle at Alice Coopers expense.  The fact that all Tim Burton did for the original cast was to give them a walk-on, was so disrespectful and half-assed!  I often wonder if the screening of this film killed the good and great Jonathan Frid!?  It was an insult!!!  The only thing that Burton got right was hiring Danny.

How closely this really compares to the old Dark Shadows series or the characters contained within, I have no idea, for I have never actually seen it.

4977381,3,B00683T5CW,"The film starts in the year 1760, where the Collins along with their young son Barnabas leave Liverpool and travel to the United States, where they open up a fishing port in Maine. Years go by and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) grows up to be somewhat of a playboy, fooling around a servant, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who is actually a powerful witch. Barnabas falls in love with Josette du Pres and rejects Angelique's affections, but the witch doesn't like rejection. She forces Josette to jump off a cliff, and one by one the Collins die. All but Barnabas as Angelique has cursed him into a vampire. When the town people find out about the vampire, they chain Barnabas inside a coffin and bury him.

It's now 1972 and a young woman named Maggie Evans is arriving at the Collinwood Manor. She is running away from her haunting past and uses the name Victoria Winters as she accepts the job as David Collin's governess.

A group of construction works stumble upon a coffin and releases the vampire Barnabas Collins, who returns to the Collinwood Manor where he meets the handyman Willie Loomis and makes him his servant. Barnabas introduces himself to the family as a distant cousin, but he does not fool the head of the household, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). With no other choice, he unveils himself as their ancestor and now a cursed vampire. He wants to be a member of the family and help restore the Collins canning business, which has went under because of a competitor, Angel Bay Fishery.

Barnabas is stunned when he sees Victoria Winters as she is the split image of his long lost love Josette. He is determined to romance the young governess. The Collins doctor, who lives with them, Dr. Hoffman easily figures out that Barnabas is a vampire, and insists that she can find a cure for the curse. Out his control, Barnabas is charming to all women and Dr. Hoffman falls in love with him.

After restoring Collinwood and the canning business, Barnabas learns that Angel Bay Fishery is owned by Angelique, who has been trying to end the Collins family line for years. She still loves Barnabas, but he still does not return her affections. Therefore, Angelique plans on destroying Barnabas and the rest of the Collins.

I went into this movie fully aware that this was a Tim Burton movie; therefore I was probably going to get a gothic comedy, in which I did. A die hard Dark Shadows fan will be disappointed that their favorite Gothic drama is now a comedy, but I watched the movie for what it was, a silly Gothic tale. The sets and the costumes look amazing. I thought Eve Green was miscast. Don't get me wrong, she is a great actress and she looks the part of Angelique, but I never felt that she was truly evil. Michelle Pfeiffer looks great for her age and she does a marvelous job playing Elizabeth. Jackie Earle Haley was the best actor in this remake, putting a new spin on Willie Loomis. Johnny Depp is goofy all the way through the movie, and looks less like the 60's Barnabas and more like an old-school vampire. Even though Barnabas is a murderer, Depp made the character funny and likeable. Now I did have some issues with Helena Bonham Carter portrayal of Dr. Hoffman, who is now a lonely drunk. I felt she was never in character and was just there to be there.

The screenplay writer Seth Grahame-Smith threw in all the Dark Shadows best with a vampire, a witch, a werewolf, and ghosts. I was disappointed that Quentin never made an appearance, but I guess that was why another Collins was a werewolf, which added nothing to the plot. I liked the small ghost storyline and the CGI special effects never bothered me. I am not for sure why Seth and Tim decided to mold Maggie Evans and Victoria Winters into one character, but it didn't bother me one bit.

Dark Shadows is somewhat underrated as I did enjoy the movie for what it was, a fun Gothic romp.",1345593600,3,3899,4.585365853658536
4977382,3,B00683T5CW,"This is a review for the film, not the DVD, as it's release is more than a month off at the time of this writing.

The promos and trailers for this were awful... if the film were as completely bad, it would have been worst or second-worst of the year (even though the year has yet to finish).

  The theatrical trailer had all the humorous bad-bits in the movie, excepting a few.  Unfortunately, the humor was not left to what one would normally expect for a horror film.  If you watched ""Time After Time,"" which was a thriller/romance, the humor, which kept the film from getting too dark, was revealed primarily with Wells' ignorance with the future.  It was therefore well placed and not distracting to the story.  Not here.  Even though many jokes are based in the main character's ignorance of future times (and the 70's in particular), they are delivered with severe heavy-handedness. So, often they are very funny, but all to a severe detriment to the film.  Then, throughout a majority of the film, Barnabas' inexperience is ignored, making the situations less believable.

  For fans of the classic TV series (like me), this will be very offensive, even though there are little additional pieces in the film which build on, or are at least a respectful salute to the show.  And there were a couple of ""outside the Dark Shadows"" mythos bits that were impressive, as well as a few background pieces (like the history of the cannery).

  The worst thing about the film, as a standalone, is that it seems like it was written by three or four people, only one who had watched the original, and only one other who had any real intelligence and creativity.  It had no feel that the screenplay had been properly edited by anyone, to make it a coherent streamlined piece.  It is very choppy and things constantly seem to be coming out of ""left-field.""  This occurs throughout the film, from the start, to the end.  As one reviewer mentioned, that after the starting monologue it completely changes tone... all the way to the end, where we get two or three revelations one after the other... (how about this?  Well, then, what do you think of that? No? Then try this!).  That was the biggest joke of the movie, even though one of the reveals was quite funny.  And seriously, how bad does a film have to be, to have a huge angry mob outside of a mansion, which includes numerous police, and not have them do anything (well, at least if they aren't paralyzed).

  The movie was quite uneven.. so much so, I would normally give a film only two stars.  However, I'm giving it three, because of all of the other elements of the film, the atmosphere, costumes, set-design, and music, all of which were way above average.

  Burton has done much better work, and so has Depp, (as a producer here -- not blaming him for the acting, which it seems most actors did well with what they were given).  In fact, they've done excellent things together. But not here.

  My big question after seeing this, is, how can one take such a rich canvas, claim respect for it, and then bollocks it up so badly with elements that clearly do not respect it.  Seriously, the trailer alone seemed to have but one aim, and that was to make everybody familiar with the original, ill, and to drive them away.

  This is worth a watch. But, as others have said, once you see this, track down the original serial, and watch that.  Do note that that the original story started earlier, with ghosts, curses, and murder, before it got around to the famous vampire, Barnabas.

Final Note: digital copies (even though often encoded cleaner than DVDs), are basically a waste unless they are ACTUALLY ENCODED ON the media you purchased, with NO INTERNET REQUIRED.  Anything you have to download costs extra in bandwidth, massive hard disc and backup space, allows the studios to track you, is not watchable directly on most devices other than a PC, and is unwatchable past the expiration date if anything happens to your computer.  So I can never recommend anything by the fact that it has a digital copy... unless you have a program which removes the DRM from your legitimate downloads.

  This type of thing was done in the 90's with CD-ROM/CD-extra material, and NONE, without exception, worked more than a couple years past their release.  I have more than 40 examples of this from early Windows and Macintosh software put on music CDs.  I don't have more, because I refused to buy anything that had critical material based on these schemes. Don't put money into anything that relies on the life of an internet page -- think about it -- how many commercial internet pages still exist at the same address and page that they did a couple years back? How many even still exist in any form at all?

4977383,5,B00683T5CW,"A man of privilege Barnabas Collins develops feelings for a woman whom is of what would be considered a working class or a poor and undesirable type.  While Barnabas never treats Angelique any differently than anyone else just because of her social status, he never truly loves Angelique.  Barnabas then later meets Josette Dupres whom is the true love of his life.  While Barnabas was also still involved with Angelique, he decides to end his relationship with her and stay true to Josette as that is whom he truly loves.  Other things transpire and after the Death of both of his parents, Barnabas develops a strong interest in Dark Magic in hopes of finding answers.  The woman, whom he had previously been involved with and no longer cares for, Angelique Bouchard, will not leave Barnabas alone.  Obsessed with Barnabas and not wanting to accept he has moved on, Angelique curses Barnabas and he is imprisoned from the 1700's until 1972.  Barnabas is finally able to escape his prison, and returns to his former home which is now inhabited by his present day relatives.  Barnabas has a difficult time adjusting to modern times as well as getting to know his family whom was not alive at the time he was imprisoned.  Angelique is not only still alive, but is also doing remarkably well and soon seeks out Barnabas whom is not very happy at all to see her, let alone know that she is actually still alive.  Angelique is still very much in love with Barnabas as he is slowly developing a new love interest with Victoria Winters.  To further complicate matters, Victoria bears an uncanny resemblance to Barnabas's true love Josette Dupres.  Barnabas decides as his new purpose in life, he is going to restore his family's name and business to what they once were.  However, the chief competitor in the business is none other than Angelique - Barnabas's former lover and long time nemesis.  Further developments and events follow and ultimately end with a climatic showdown which also throws in a few twists not hinted at earlier in the movie.

I must say that first I am not very familiar with the Original TV series, so for some of the people whom have reviewed the movie and were disappointed I am sorry to hear you feel that way.  However as someone, whom had no knowledge of the back story or much else at all for that matter about Dark Shadows, I really loved the movie very much and I am looking forward to the Bluray.  I loved the way the story was told from this perspective, as a movie by itself (if you do not take any of the previous Dark Shadows material into account....) it was great!  There are times when the movie seems to slow down but overall I loved how the odd jokes and the sarcasm were presented in the way that only Johnny Depp can present them!  I don't want to give anything away other than if you have not seen this movie, what are you waiting for?  Pre-Order this like yesterday!  The movie will be even better than it was in the theater!

I cannot wait to see what additional footage was left out of the original cut!  For the people that saw the movie and hated it because they were longtime Dark Shadows fans - Perhaps you may like the movie more with the extra footage?  I want to see to see how holes in the story onscreen are filled in and other elements of the film are expanded upon.

I also want to say that I am not very familiar with Eva Green (Angelique Bouchard); however she was amazing in her role and bought the character to life. It was great to see Chloe Moretz (Carolyn Stoddard) again who will only continue to become a bigger star in the future.  One of the reasons I was interested in this movie was Johnny Depp whom of course portrays Barnabas Collins.  That's not to say the movie is shabby or anything of the sort, I was just not familiar with the Dark Shadows Franchise in anything other than the name.

Helena Bonham Carter (Dr. Julia Hoffman), Michelle Pfeiffer - (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard), and Jackie Earle Haley (Willie Loomis) were all great casting choices as well as of course Bella Heathcote  (Victoria Winters/Josette Dupres).  The only other part I can think of that was of more than just a passing mention would be that of David Collins played by Gulliver McGrath.  The one role I was not impressed much at all with was that of Roger Collins played by Johnny Lee Miller whom is a solid actor though this was just not his movie.

I loved the movie, a sequel would be nice...though Depp may be tied up doing the next two Pirates Of The Caribbean movies (which are going to be filmed simultaneously and then released separately).

 So Pre-order Dark Shadows already! Or at the least, rent this on Amazon as soon as its put up for streaming and then buy it when you can.....but do whatever you can to see it.  It's great!",1345334400,11,4785,4.524418604651163

Loved ""Sweeney Todd,""and I generally have a very high regard for Mr. Burton's work. But this movie, comparisons with the original series aside, is just plain awful. It lacks plot, and seems to be anchored down by its attempts to make references to the original series.

I guess the really frustrating thing here is if you were going to reach back to the original series for material there were at least 8000 storylines & subplots that you could have drawn from. Unfortunately Seth Graham Greene chose to disregard all of those and gave us a sophomoric script that's a combination between the TV series Dallas and the previous Burton movie Beetlejuice. Seriously, the goings-on between Angelique and Barnabas remind me of the antics and sibling rivalry between Bobby Ewing and JR Ewing. As hard as Johnny Depp tries to make the material work, he just can't.

Anybody older than 12 is going to be totally annoyed by Chloe Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard. There's just absolutely nothing likable about this character and nothing in her performance to make you care one lick about what happens to her or the rest of the family. Eva Green is totally miscast as Angelique, and Michelle Pfeiffer - who is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood - seems to be completely wasted on this material. That goes double for Helena Bonham Carter.

The movie does have a couple of nice moments. Watching the opening titles with Victoria Winters riding a train into Collinwood, set to the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin""was sort of breathtaking. And surprisingly, Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis is the bright spot in this mess of a movie. He truly is funny and got some belly laughs... more than once.

I don't know who to be madder at. Seth Graham Greene, or Tim Burton. But I waited 50 years for someone to do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer. No one seems to have figured out that one of the reasons the original series worked is there were always two story lines going at the same time. It never was all about Barnabas Collins. There was Elizabeth Stoddard and Jason Maguire. And then there was Barnabas and Maggie Evans. The interplay between the two story lines is what made the series so interesting. In the 1700s it was Barnabas and Angelique, and Vicky and Peter Bradford, and I can go on. Etc. etc.

They used the excuse that they needed to update the story for modern audience. I am insulted. Next time, How about a little bit of imagination and ingenuity?",1345075200,19,2673,4.59538784067086

I was expecting more of a love story (I grew up watching the Dark Shadows remake of the 90s), but when I figured out what the movie was meant to be, I dropped my expectations and just went with it. Burton and Depp give a nod to the overacting and over-makeup of the silent film era and a nod to the kitschy 60s and 70s era with a subtly twisted humor. Vampires, lava lamps, funky 70s earrings, an exploding fish cannery, and Alice Cooper... what's not to like, lol?",1345075200,10,592,4.390909090909091

There wasn't a boring moment as the movie moved from one intriguing and highly dramatic scene to the next. Most notable are the special effects and make-up. Furthermore, all of the characters were interesting and very well acted. What keeps this movie intriguing is that it contains several sub-plots enmeshed into the main plot.

Johnny Depp played his character exceptionally well with the utmost professional skill. The hilarious one-liners were delivered with perfection. Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, and Helena Bonham Carter performed with hilarious wit, too. The musical shock-rock legend Alice Cooper made a fantastic cameo and performance. Additionally, a cameo by horror legend Christopher Lee was a much appreciated surprise.

The horror and silliness elements of the movie worked very well together in creating a great campy retrogressive fusion.

This movie is recommended to those who are fans of Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Alice Cooper, and campy horror movies.

I give this movie an A-.",1344988800,8,1146,5.314917127071824
4977389,5,B00683T5CW,"I was a big fan of the Dark Shadows TV series and was excited to hear that Tim Burton was going to make the movie.  I thought if anyone can create the murky dark atmosphere of the TV series it would be him.  I along with others was disappointed to see the corny trailer that came out.  A comedy?  What?  Sacrilege. I decided to see the movie anyway making my peace with the fact that this was not going to be like the TV show.  I was able to separate the two and just look at it as its own piece and its own movie.

Luckily by doing that, I found that I was entertained with this film and enjoyed every minute of it.  I suppose it did what its job was meant to do.  Entertain.  I also found that it wasn't nearly as comedic as they made it out to be with the trailer.  It was darker and more gothic and interesting.  The mood as in any Tim Burton movie was offbeat and not of this world.  Johnny Depp who did not look like himself made a great vampire coming to terms with being in the wrong century.  Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning and as always lit up the screen with her ferocious take on the reclusive dark matriarch.  The two surprises were Eva Green as Angelique Bouchard and Chloe Moretz who played Carolyn Stoddard. They both leapt gleefully into their characters prompting me to wonder who those two actors I'd never heard of were.

Critiquing this movie as its own piece without comparing it to the TV series or Tim Burton's earlier work, I thought it was fun and entertaining.  Comparing it to the TV series or Burton's older films, then no it doesn't hold a candle and not his best work.  It was however better than Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, Alice in Wonderland and maybe even Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.  Sweeney Todd was a great movie, but I can only take so much of a movie where people are singing throughout it.  As great as Sweeney Todd was, I'm more likely to throw this Dark Shadows on instead.

Buy collections of the old tv show and see how dark it is and you will find out that Tim Burton did a very good job of this film. I was very impressed with how good this movie was.

4977391,3,B00683T5CW,"May contain spoilers.

Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp team up again for yet another version of their quirkiness.  OK, we get it.  While I never watched the ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera, I understand it was not supposed to be humorous.  So when transplanted to the screen should it have been more serious?  Eh, maybe not.  But at least make up your mind.

The movie begins with something similar to Coppala's version of ""Dracula"" (1992) where Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed by a witch around 1776 for spurning her love for another.  He becomes a vampire but is soon captured and buried in a silver chained coffin.  Nearly 200 years later the coffin is uncovered at a construction site and Barnabas is set free.  He finds his old homestead is in a poor state and that his fishing enterprise has floundered and replaced by a witchy descendent of Angelique (Eva Green).  Spoiler alert:  The witch is the same person, but has aged well.

Barnabas confides in the current head of the household Elizabeth (a still stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) of his secret but doesn't ""come out"" to the others until later.  The house is filled with off kilter children (Chloe Moretz and Gulliver McGrath) and even weirder adult staffers (Jackie Earle Haley, Helena Bonham Carter and Ray Shirley).  Then of course there is the beautiful Bella Heathcote as Victoria, the reincarnation of Barnabas original love from 1776 who was offed by an Angelique spell.

The film is full of some excellent photography and well used CGI but it continually bogs down.  Full of fits and starts, it can't make up its mind what kind of movie it is supposed to be.  I did think the scene where Barnabas can't resist the amorous advances of Angelique to be pretty good.  And we do learn with certainty that when a vampire has sex, bedrooms are destroyed (see ""True Blood"" and ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn"" for further proof).  Although the ending includes an opening for a sequel, I wouldn't bet on it happening.",1344729600,5,1974,4.766961651917404

There were no huge surprises but I didn't care.  It took me somewhere I enjoyed being, and entertained me while I was there with enjoyable characters and a fun tale.

4977395,4,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton's twisted reimaging of Dark Shadows is not for everyone - An open mind is a must for this film. It isn't an outright comedy, but it does have fun with the melodrama and stiff style of the original 1960s TV series. Johnny Depp is creepily perfect as the vampire Barnabas, and the rest of the cast is equally good - The stylish visuals are spectacular, the plot is convoluted and perhaps a bit unfocused, but there is obvious love for the source material in Burton's work. The nay-sayers may have cried foul over the film's outrageous approach, but Tim Burton's signature style is a perfect match for the Gothic weirdness of this classic saga. I would have given the film five stars, but a couple of needlessly tacky sexual jokes lowered the tone just a bit - Even so, four strong stars for this off-beat tale of an 18th Century vampire in the modern world.

I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a serious dramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice.

In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Victoria Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to bring the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him.

A ghost can destroy an all-powerful witch but a shotgun, a vampire and a werewolf are totally useless! It's OK to create another blood thirsty vampire because you are in love and the person blackmails you!

The main message of Dark Shadows is that's it's OK to kill in order to have wealth, power and prestige. The ends justify the means! How sickening!

4977400,5,B00683T5CW,"Although many ardent fans of the 1960's soap opera did not like the 2012 film version of the series, ""Dark Shadows"" starring Johnny Depp really is a fun film. I believe that most purists of the daytime serial (including myself) were hoping for a script that was melodramatic in tone and stuck to what made the show a success in the first place: a piece of work that may have been hard to believe but took itself so seriously that one became lost in the characters and stories. Instead, Tim Burton's take on ""Dark Shadows"" is a comedic one with the bulk of the script dealing with Barnabas Collins being released from his coffin in 1972 and trying to adjust to a new time with strange people and events.

 All of the original characters from the ABC series are present and Johnny Depp (an ardent fan of Barnabas and of the show) does his best with the material he is given, but as I was watching the film I couldn't help think that there will only be one true Barnabas and that is Jonathan Frid who sadly passed away a few weeks before the film's debut in theaters. Jonathan actually has a cameo in the movie (his last acting role as a guest at a party) along with others from the serial including the beautiful Lara Parker (Angelique), David Selby (Quentin Collins) and Katherine Leigh Scott (Maggie Evans/Josette DuPres).

 The Blue Ray will feature 9 scenes cut from the theatrical release so that is something to look forward.

 ""Dark Shadows"" was a hit upon its release in May, 2012 making $236,000,000 on a $150,000,000 budget so Warners was quite happy and it did bring renewed interest in the original series with MPI releasing a beautiful box set of all 1225 episodes along with a slew of bonus features in a coffin that quickly sold out.

A great cast was completely wasted in this wretched movie.  I had high hopes as the film began with Depp's voice over relating the Collins family history and his tragic transformation into a creature of the night. Almost every scene thereafter is an affront to those who cherish the original series (and yes I did read that Burton said his version was not intended for old fans,but come on!). I can't really fault the actors. I think they did as best they could with the script (which seems as if it was written by two drunk teenagers during a farting contest) and the direction (does
Burton even CARE anymore???) they had to deal with. Burton has made some great films in the past but this is definitely NOT one of them. Old fans should stay away. Those who didn't know what to expect but did like this remake ought to check out the real deal and decide for themselves.

4977406,4,B00683T5CW,"I really look forward to the Blu-Ray Release of Burton's Dark Shadows as it sounds like there are nine additional segments to the movie that can be watched individually or as part of an expanded feature film...if I understand correctly. For sure there is a fairly fast, fun paced DARK yet FUNNY movie.

To begin with...if you are a traditional vampire purist...you WILL be aggravated that Barnabas never encounters a Crucifix, never disappears on demand or turns into a bat nor is required to sleep in his coffin by day.

The Burton ""take"" on the Collins family (and employees) yields Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, her brother Roger Collins, her daughter Carolyn, his son David, Dr Julia Hoffman, Willie Loomis, Sarah Johnson and of course Barnabas Collins. ""Victoria Winters"" and Angelique Bouchard round out the main cast.

The flick is a nice tight jaunt of around 113 minutes and is very well paced. Most of the material seen on the movie trailers are quickly whisked by in the film's first ten to fifteen minutes. The story of the Barnabas' original time period from 1752 thru 1776 is recounted swiftly including his being cursed (for rejecting Angelique) and buried alive by the town's people (for being a monster). Barnabas' parents Joshua and Naomi are shown so briefly that all we remember is Joshua's declaration that ""family is only the REAL wealth"" while he builds a formidable fortune (using the wealth he built up in Liverpool) by building the seaport town of Collinsport and transforming it into a great fishery/sea port.

Light humor abounds throughout the flick...most of it pertaining to Barnabas trying to `ingest"" and ""adjust to"" this great new age of 1972 after being released from his chained coffin after a construction crew literally bangs into his coffin. Barnabas is released. The construction crew do not live to tell about their discovery as Barnabas' nutrient deprived body demands a quick and furious feast.

After an encounter with ""Mephistopheles"", ""Lucifer"" and the towns people...Barnabas finally makes his way to Collinwood. He is shocked to discover the dilapidated condition that Collinwood is in and immediately seeks out the matriarch for some answers. He makes it clear to the matriarch that he's the original Barnabas Collins cursed for two centuries. She thinks he's an intruder looking for money and blood until he shows her the Family Wealth safely hidden in the lowest secret passages of the mansion. She, then, realizes that Barnabas is the genuine item and she introduces him to the family the next morning at breakfast but keeps his secret intact.

Angelique, meanwhile, has spent two centuries being a rival to the Collins family industry and has driven them to almost poverty levels. Angelique subsequently learns of Barnabas being released from his ""life imprisonment"" and throws all her witchery to wage war against Barnabas and the Collins family..

During the remaining hour and change of the film...we are treated to the fact that the Collins family members as well as the new governess, ""Victoria Winters"" each have secrets that are brought to light during the course of the film.

Dr Hoffman discovers that Barnabas is a vampire and promises to cure him as Barnabas is soon walking out in the light of day albeit that he appears somewhat like Michael Jackson with an umbrella.

In the midst of this drama...Barnabas wants to gain the favor of the townsfolk by throwing a ""happening"".  According to Carolyn...the ""happening"" needs lots of booze and a superstar singer to ""rock"" the town as she suggests Alice Cooper.  Barnabas promises enough booze to fill a schooner and declares ""she"", Alice Cooper, will be the guest of the Collins Family.  The Collinsport ""happening"" is a success.

It's at this point that I would like to comment on the film's soundtrack.  Burton very effectively uses Percy Faith's a theme from ""A Summer Place""...The Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin""....The Carpenter's ""Top Of The World"" and Alice Cooper's ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" and ""Ballad of Dwight Frye"".  Other nice selections are included.  Loved the music.

As the film drives toward it's climax...Barnabas and the Collins family steadily move toward their final battle with Angelique which contains a surprise or two.

I found the ending (unlike most movie reviewers) quite satisfying after Burton throws everything but the kitchen sink into the final conflict. Unlike many reviewers I did not see a strong indication for a sequel. I don't expect one.

The cast performed superbly.  Special Kudos to Johnny Depp and Eva Green as Barnabas and Angelique...but they were all superb in my opinion.

After all is said and done...I loved Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"" for being uniquely it's own film not borrowing from the two Dan Curtis films of the 1970s. The visuals do overshadow the script....but we are having so much fun watching all the dysfunctional members of the family fighting for the Collins' true core value that ""family is the only REAL wealth""...that we don't see any reason to criticize the script's shortcomings because it's so darn much fun.",1343692800,174,5092,5.038095238095238

In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Victoria Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to bring the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart Gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!",1343606400,21,1551,4.702205882352941

4977412,1,B00683T5CW,"If You think Tim Burton and Johnny Depp can do no wrong, then you will probably love this film. If however, you would like to see a really great theatrical adaptation of the classic TV series Dark Shadows - well, better luck next time. Alas, this is not so much ""Dark Shadows"", as it is ""The Tim Burton movie"" - pretty much the same one he's been making over and over for more than a decade now. Tim was great back when he was doing projects that were not remakes, but as soon as he started ""Re-imagining"" classics, he fell into a rut, and hasn't been able to climb out, and Johnny Depp is stuck down there with him. The film starts out promisingly enough, with a similar origin story to the series, but when Barnabas wakes up in 1972, and meets his Addams Family wanna-be relatives, it all starts to come unglued. A bunch of not so funny 1970s pop culture gags follow, then we get to see Barney battle the evil Witch who vamped him out in the first place. This ain't no Hammer film, so instead of the edge of your seat Undead Nosferatu taking on a Satanic Sorceress monster clash, we get a quip spouting pale skinned goofball, competing with a Yuppie Itch-Bay in a bad wig, to see who's company can sell more Fish sticks. Yea, there is Gothic window dressing, and some Monster and Ghost lip service, but this is not your Parent's Dark Shadows - their's was way better! There are some good things that this movie has helped to bring about. Apparently, because it flopped(deservedly so), some other classics may be spared the same fate. Depp's next Victims were to be The Thin Man, and Kolchak the Night Stalker, and the former has already been shelved, hopefully, the latter will follow. Also, the REAL Dark Shadows movies(House of, and Night of)are finally being released on Blu-Ray/DVD to coincide with Burton's folly. I'm rooting for the originals to out sell Burton's, that would be sweet revenge indeed!",1342915200,5,1908,4.549418604651163
4977413,5,B00683T5CW,"First off, let me say that I respect the DS fanatics out there who were upset that this film is a comedy.  I do think fans of the TV series might consider that other who watched this show might have found some of it to be funny.  Also it was, i admit, wierd that they had the story take place in 1972 with the main character comming from 200 years in the past and not knowing what to make of this ""strange new age"", an age the people in attendance, most of them, were not born for.  Lighten up people.  This film was funny, the sets were amazing, the story was OK for the material, a gothic romance about a spurned witch, a vampire and the people caught in the middle.  No it was not really true to the TV show, the theme song was notably missing but we did get to see the water crashing on the rocks, and perhaps 1972 was not the perfect time for it.  I don't care.  Johnny Depps lines and the musical number pairing Chloe Grace Morits with Alice Cooper (my childhood hero) made the film more then worth seeing.  This movie is currently playing in the ""cheap"" theaters, where I have just talked two friends into seeing it (i have seen in 3 times now and find something new every time) it's really worth seeing on the big screen and I can't wait for the Blu Ray.  Sadly I will have to add this to a too long list of films that I loved and no one (or very few) others cared for.  I can't help it if I am right everyone else is wrong.",1342396800,3,1432,4.046099290780142
4977414,5,B00683T5CW,"When I saw that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were making a big screen adaptation of ""Dark Shadows"" I was thrilled. But a little apprehensive, how could a clunky, corn ball old television show be revived and made relevant for today? The attempt at resurrecting it in the early 1990's as a television series with Ben Cross in the lead was a dismal failure and a horror, but not in a good way. But I felt that if anyone could pull it off Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could. What I didn't realize was how well they would do it. The new ""Dark Shadows"" is surprisingly very, very good! Depp of course is absolutely perfect as the fish-out-of-water Barnabas, released from his coffin in 1972 after being trapped in it and buried away for over a century. The culture clash is hilarious. Depp's Barnabas is a hoot, but also very endearing and lovable. The film is much darker than the trailer suggests, much closer in feel to Burton's wonderful ""Sleepy Hollow."" Though some of the silly fans of the old series were hilariously outraged that the film was a ,gasp, ""comedy,"" they can be totally ignored and their opinions regarded as irrelevant, because nothing anyone could do with ""their"" show would make them happy. They should just watch the old show's dvds and stay in their fantasy world. Now don't get me wrong, the old show is fun and has a certain charm, and Jonathan Frid and Grayson Hall are great. But the show was always campy and impossible to take seriously. Anyway it was great for its time, but that was then, this is now. Burton took the right approach in revving up the fun. The new DS is what the old show would have been if they had had a big budget and writers with a better sense of humor. Frid and the other cast members of the old show were cool enough to ""get it"", they loved the new movie. It was sad that Jonathan Frid died just before it's release. The movie succeeds, however, largely due to the fact that Burton and Depp genuinely love the old series and paid loving homage to it. The cast is perfect, especially Michelle Pheiffer as Elizabeth the matron of the 1972 Collins family and Eva Green as the witch Angelique. Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman is great and steals every scene she's in, as does Jackie Earl Haley as Willie Loomis. Chlo Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath are delightful as the Collins kids. The entire cast is great including Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee in wonderful cameos. The production values are first rate, the movie is beautiful and visually stunning, and the music! The music is incredible, maybe one of the best scores ever! The Danny Elman score is unexpectedly brilliant! And the incorporation of some great old 70's songs like ""Knights in White Satin"" and ""Go All the Way"" is also brilliantly achieved. The Carpenters ""Top of the World"" has never sounded so cool! Barry White's ""My First, My Last, My Everything,"" is the perfect accompaniment to a hilarious love-making scene between Barnabas and Angelique. It's great seeing all the 1972 nostalgic references, like ""Scooby Doo"" on television and ""Deliverance"" and ""Dracula AD 1972"" on theater marquees. The lava lamp is great fun! The movie is fun, brilliant and a breath of fresh air, everything it should be and I can't wait to own in on dvd! I hope the film does well enough box-office wise to warrant a sequel. It has made so far nearly 80,000,000 at the US box-office, which is amazingly good for a film so off-beat, with such a quirky sense of humor and based on an old 1960's/'70's forgotten television show! Plus it has become fashionable for movie critics to unfairly trash anything Tim Burton does. The movie will grow in popularity when it becomes a cult film on the college circuit and is released on dvd and to cable television, it will find its audience in the US. And the film has done very well internationally, world-wide it's box-office gross is close to $250,000,000 so far. That's good news for Barnabas and company and the movie is good news for audiences who enjoy a slick blend of humor and horror.

4977416,4,B00683T5CW,"Uncustomarily compelled to emerge from My Noctuary Lair to attend the external theatre experience, I recently viewed this presentation for the amusement of it, actually not expecting too much by way of factual or actual content, usually preferring one's own viewing room, or the drive-in for these purposes. Yet harboring a deep affinity for the series, and being appreciative of the productions of Tim Burton {especially in combination with Maestro Danny Elfman's orchestrations}, it seemed a natural inspection. He does have a knack for splendidly presenting the Gothic sensibility to a fine point, after all.

I first became pleasantly aware of this sinister series through rebroadcasts on a local channel, and has since become preferred entertainment fare, which is presented in a serious vain, whose Gothic psychodramas seem to reflect many predispositions and innate interests. The uses of mood lighting, suspenseful music, occult story lines, grants it a brooding atmosphere similar to Hammer films, yet imbued with Dan Curtis' unique psychological darkness. Dark Shadows features not only vampires & witches, but warlocks, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, sinister cults, insane preachers, time-travels, mad killers, demons, & many more creatures & situations of a paranormal nature.

As far as Dark Shadows films are concerned, I personally recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Dark-Shadows/dp/B0012DP6L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Of-Dark-Shadows/dp/B002SP99BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Of Dark Shadows</a>.

So, when I first viewed the preview for the film, it was a bit underwhelming, as it focuses primarily on the 70's comedic elements, yet in the overall film, it actually became beside the point. Actually, I thought it a bit appropriate after all, that since the series was broadcast in the late 60's/early 70's season {actually premiering in Year 1 A.S.}, that the setting seemed to make sense for a plot such as this. Being leery of any 'remakes, since the early 90's adaptation was actually a pleasing tribute, but what may be condensed in a 113 minute film? Obviously, if you want the real thing, just continue viewing and submerging yourself therein. I have been collecting these on DVD as they became available, & most remarkably, the entire series has recently become available in the marvelous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-The-Complete-Original-Series-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B007PZ6SYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)</a>.

In October of VII A.S., Barnabas Collins is unleashed from a century of subterranean incarceration by construction workmen {instead of groundskeeper Willy Loomis immediately, whom he meets shortly}, who of course, sates his blood lust forthwith. He meets a drunken Willy {his 'Renfield'} wandering the Collinswood grounds among the pumpkins, who after a quick interrogation about the current surroundings, quickly assumes his role.

Arriving at the Collinswood estate, he meets with elegant matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and the rest of the surviving family. She is obviously taken aback by his arrival {return}, thus revealing some interesting house secrets during the introduction. After all, a pleasantly dark chamber via a secret passageway is a necessity for any vampire! His descriptions of the architecture and history of the fine resident possessions therein are a remarkable relation, in marked appreciation for the construction of their materialization.

Present are Elizabeth {the lovely, stately, lady of the manor}, Dr. Hoffman {here, the professional intellectual physician is portrayed as an attractive, fiery-haired lush living a life of quiet desperation}, David {well-portrayed, rather like a Damien}, pretty little Carolyn Stoddard {the impetuous blonde here portrayed as a hippie-like stoner / rebellious 'party girl' type}, & Roger Collins {the stoic gentleman here portrayed as a rude, inconstant, boorish lothario}. While Barnabas himself is here portrayed in a more slender variation, more akin to a callow&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nosferatu/dp/B00005R87K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nosferatu</a>, intentionally depicted.

With the help of these new-found relatives, Barnabas goes about familiarizing himself with the culture, to some amusing interactions with automobiles, entertainment evolutions, & technological advancements. The juxtaposition between a gentleman of eloquence, fine tastes, irrefutable deportment, dashing style, and elite dispositions, to that of an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.

Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum. Most amusingly intriguing indeed.

He eventually becomes re-acquainted with a busty Angelique Bouchard, the source of his torments, for those unfamiliar, in what would amount to be an undead fatal attraction, the witch who commended him into the coffin-prison for refuting her advances in favor of his dear Josette DuPres {a sweetly diminutive fianc&eacute;}, who herself plunged from Widow's Hill at the bidding of black witchcraft. Harboring resentment of Barnabas & the successes of The Collins Family since childhood, Angelique uses her own immortality & wiles to raise her family name to prominence. Of course, that re-acquaintance yields a passionate fling finally culminating in a final battle.

Notable scenes include: one Alice Cooper performing at a ball circa&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-to-My-Nightmare/dp/B000002I99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome to My Nightmare</a>, with Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott in attendance. ""David! Go watch the Cooper woman!""; a haggard Christopher Lee as Clarney the fisherman hypnotized by Barnabas; Barnabas lays some hippies to waste while camping in the forest.

As pleasurably typical of Tim Burton productions, the sets are a majestic marvel to behold, the music enriching with an inspired soundtrack by Danny Elfman, familiar & compelling characterizations, complimenting the overall experience. In this case, this rendition is an amusing aside, created as a quirky notion of how a vampire would interact with an outside herd world, in continued predation, of course. As a combination Gothic / Comedy / Thriller, it certainly has its moments in the shadows, even while venturing into the lightmare, and may certainly be good for a nefarious cachinnation or two, while asserting an enhanced appreciation for the core origins.

4977417,5,B00683T5CW,Other people have gone into great detail about the film and what to expect so I'll be brief. It a wonderfully executed piece that doesn't take itself too seriously. As a DARK comedy it's right on target. I also feel the script did the best it could what with the original soap opera line up. It was a huge cast of characters and there is only so much time you can devote to each. I personally would enjoy a sequel so that more character depth could be added. As it is I think you got a good sample of Collinsport in a two hour package. Also the humor with the way Barnabas reacts to the modern world is definitely needed. I always found it odd in the original series that Barnabas just went about the modern day Collinsport as though he had never been gone.,1341705600,,757,4.227586206896552
4977418,2,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton has made a career off of the `strange and unusual'. In fact, he has rarely strayed from that formula in his entire career. He has made gems like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman"", ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sweeney Todd"", and the list goes on and on. He has also teamed up with Johnny Depp now eight times.  With ""Dark Shadows"" he has kept with the `strange and unusual' theme, but the strangest thing about it, is the lack of comedy in the film, despite the trailers obvious comedic tone.

I wasn't sure what to think about ""Dark Shadows"". I have been a huge fan of Tim Burton over the years, but the trailer promoting the film just didn't grab me as funny. I felt like the trailer was trying to be funny, and I found it `strange' and flat. I know now, after watching the film, that my perception and preconceived notion was the correct one.

For all I know, the film will enjoy the same camp following as the television show in which it is based upon. In 1966, the television show ""Dark Shadows"" debuted on ABC and it was melodramatic, campy and `strange'. The television show was a gothic soap opera and that is exactly what the film is. It centers around Barnabas Collins, a man who unfortunately draws the intense eye of a hired help named Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). He doesn't return her affections and when he falls in love with another. Bouchard, a witch, casts spells that change all of their lives forever.

The film has amazing effects and design. Most Burton films do. I was most drawn by the amazing effect they had for the witch as she cracks from time to time like a porcelain doll. It was an amazing effect, and it isn't the only one. The thing about ""Dark Shadows"" is that it could have been great. It had the potential to be great, but there were just too many scenes that served no purpose in the film, except to try and be funny and most weren't. The movie jumped from drama to comedy without warning and it never tapped into a single emotion the whole time.

I wanted to like it. That's the thing. When you go into a film `wanting' to like it and knowing you're going to like it, and don't. There's something wrong. A better script should have been written.",1341446400,25,2242,4.485294117647059

Burton, as usual, combines visual imagery with a Gothic story suffused with humor. Barnabas is a resurrected vampire that got screwed over centuries ago by a witch he spurned and he now goes to his family's estate, where his down on their luck descendants dwell. There are countless jokes having to do with his being a stranger in a strange land and his anachronistic attire and speech. The witch, incidentally, is still around and still wants to rekindle the love and, if that fails, do away with him all over again. It's a silly plot, sure, but what the hell, it was still enjoyable.",1339372800,2,744,4.511111111111111
4977427,4,B00683T5CW,"Poor old Tim Burton had to deal with two of the most difficult problems a movie-maker faces when putting together a film.

First, he was making a movie loosely based on an old TV series. Predictably, the reviews of many people focus on the fact that the movie is not like the TV series. People do love their memories and to see the characters and atmosphere changed from what they remember causes them anguish and leads to endless comments in which the words 'in the tv series', 'in the original Dark Shadows' or even 'in the real Dark Shadows' feature prominently.

Second, he was making a comedy for the big screen. In order to get people to come to see it in theaters, it's necessary to show trailers and the trailers for a comedy have to be funny. The movie-maker is therefore forced to choose between screening some of the best jokes in the trailers in order to attract an audience and having the jokes fall flat in the film because people have already seen them or not showing the best stuff in the trailers and risking a flop because no-one thinks the film is funny enough to want to come and see it.

Personally, I never saw Dark Shadows when it was a soap opera, so I had no preconceptions of what the movie 'should' contain. In that sense, I'm the ideal audience for Burton, but unfortunately for him, many people did come and see the movie hoping for a continuation of the program they recalled. However, I did see the trailers and sure enough, seeing the same jokes in the film wasn't nearly as funny as it would have been had I never seen them before. Perhaps one day an adventurous movie-maker will produce a trailer which has a completely different set of jokes in it and sell it on the basis that the film is even funnier- but then people would probably be disappointed that a joke in the trailer wasn't in the movie!

I thought this was an entertaining film, based on Johnny Depp's wonderful ability to convey thoughts and emotions through subtle (yes, even in this film) changes of facial expression and tone of voice. The supporting cast was excellent, there was lots of action and the sets and special effects were, as always in Tim Burton movies, outstanding. It's not a film I'd watch over and over, but it certainly wasn't a disappointment. Try and watch it without comparing it with the TV series and you might find you enjoy it on its own terms.",1338940800,,2370,4.491879350348028

It was all over the place. It wasn't like just a hybrid of two movie types, no that would make it good. It was more of a hybrid of 5 movie types and it didn't know what to do during certain situations. For example, you wold think a horror scene is being seen, but all this slack-stick is in the background made it not scary at all. Then, while you think a normal comedy scene is being seen, suddenly comes the horror? Then, you get a ending that seemed more twilight than anything.

Depp's characterization is marvelous, the decor is marvelous, the prologue is marvelous, some of the in jokes about the 70's are marvelous. What's bad? The script, the rest of the characters-actors, some of the dramatic license taken with story plot lines, the music (and I love Danny Elfman), the complete absence of eerieness the series was known for, the ending which looked like it came out of a Michael Bey movie, Carolyn the Werewolf, and Eva Green, Eva Green, Eva Green as Angelique. Thankfully, the movie is not performing well enough to warrant a sequel. Unfortunately, this could mean the end of any further DS projects from anyone.",1338595200,2,1020,4.6353591160221

4977435,2,B00683T5CW,"So, here is yet another Tim Burton / Johnny Depp film, this time a remake of a late 60s TV show I have never seen. But it is a Burton / Depp film anyway, which means you have great visuals and an eccentric character Depp plays with a heavy make-up just like in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Alice in Wonderland."" Frankly, I was not much impressed with either of them. Now with ""Dark Shadows"" their efforts are getting formulaic.

""Dark Shadows"" is a typical case of ""pieces better than the whole."" Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, a well-to-do 18th century gentleman turned into a vampire, who, after being confined in a coffin for about 200 years, wakes up again in 1972 (one year after the original TV show ended). To watch Depp's Barnabas amazed by the 1970s pop culture is just fun. The Alice Cooper concert scene (played by himself) is one of the film's highlights.

Unfortunately, it seems the writer Seth Grahame-Smith (known for his book ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") didn't come up with a coherent narrative for the protagonist Barnabas, who is not exactly a likeable person. Some may say the unfaithful womanizer well deserves the ""curse."" He also kills innocent people like Sweeney Todd. Unlike the film of the murderous barber of Fleet Street (directed by Burton), however, ""Dark Shadows"" does not give us any single reason for us to care for the film's hero.

The supporting players include Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller, Chlo Grace Moretz and Michelle Pfeiffer. Except Eva Green as the ""evil"" witch Angelique, completely overshadowing Bella Heathcote's heroine(s), none of them is memorable. Perhaps Tim Burton is not really interested.

""Dark Shadows"" is one of the most disappointing Tim Burton films, in a sense as bad as his ""re-imagined"" version of ""Planet of the Apes."" And ""Apes"" didn't have Johnny Depp.",1338076800,4,1884,4.915094339622642
4977436,5,B00683T5CW,"First off I am not a fan of the original Dark Shadows, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton or the vampire genre. I would have never went to see this movie if it weren't for two things: 1. My wife begged me to go and 2. Alice Cooper is my Idol. Anywho, I went to this movie expecting nothing, and left very satisfied. Though I am not a fan of most of his movies, I cannot dispute that Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins)is a fantastic actor. His supporting cast especially Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) , Helena Bonham Carter (Dr. Julia Hoffman) , Chlo Grace Moretz (Carolyn Stoddard) and Jackie Earle Haley (Willie Loomis) are all incredible in their own right. With the ensemble cast and the very good directing (again, though not a fan I cannot dispute Tim Burton's talents)the movie was still about Dark Shadows, something I never ever cared about. Enter Seth Grahame-Smith. The story was silly enough to make me laugh, but interesting enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire movie. Add the fact that I got to hear a couple of Alice Cooper classics and it was a very entertaining two hours. I actually thanked my wife for making me go. I will say I wasn't crazy with the entire final scenario, but all in all I really enjoyed a movie I was expecting to hate. I would highly recommend this movie and it has also peaked my interest in the original series.",1337990400,2,1364,4.548780487804878
4977437,5,B00683T5CW,"I have been an avid fan of Dark Shadows since it began in 1966 (pre-Barnabas).  I have also long been a fan of the talented Johnny Depp.  That said, I was delighted to hear he was finally filming a version of the show he so loved as a child.

I really enjoyed his performance (and that of the superb supporting cast).  It was entertaining, enjoyable and  respectful, but certainly had it's own take on the original show.  I thought Johnny's nod to the late Jonathan Frid was as inspired as it was touching.

Go see the film -- and enjoy it for what it is, not what it is not....",1337990400,2,578,4.2
4977438,4,B00683T5CW,"The Burton/Depp formula has been tried and proven so many times that it needs no further comment. When you see them pair up, just watch it. This flick meets their finest standards.

As a continuation of the original: I wish I could comment, but I never became a fan. But, as entertainment in itself, this offers more laughs than just about anything else in theaters this season. Depp's utterly straight-faced rendering makes the movie, of course. The simian housekeeper has his moments, and the bratty teenage girl comes into her own late in the game. (Hint: when ""that time of month"" comes, she has some serious issues around shaving her legs.)

Fine, fun, and forgettable entertainment. It has some great lines, it sustains its energy, but I can't say it did much for me the day after I saw it - and that's one big way I evaluate a movie.

Like most actors, Johnny will do just about anything to make a buck! Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares anyway? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next, The Avengers; and now Dark Shadows!

Here are some of the twisted messages you will find in Dark Shadows, which is a mere shadow of the 1960's TV series (pun intended)! It's OK to harbor a blood-thirsty vampire that has killed 11 totally innocent blue collar workers and then 10 friendly and gentle young adults because the depraved vampire will make my family prosperous and prestigious again. A 10-year old boy with no super powers can unchain a vampire, but a vampire with super powers is totally helpless. A ghost can destroy an all-powerful witch but a shotgun, a vampire and a werewolf are totally useless! It's OK to create another blood thirsty vampire because you are in love and the person blackmails you!

The main message of Dark Shadows is that's it's OK to kill in order to have wealth, power and prestige. The ends justify the means! How sickening!

Dark Shadows is so bad I have made a pact with myself! Despite how much I love sitting among a live audience, I will refrain from going to the movies until the The Hobbit is released at the end of the year.

4977441,2,B00683T5CW,"Maybe someday Tim Burton will wander back from cuckooland and once more make movies that grip you beyond the pretty,pretty visuals. DARK SHADOWS starts out so promisingly, getting me so enthused, and then, as it went on, the awfulness seeped in and built and built. Here I am, tearing out of the movie theater, in a foul, condemning mood. My date's asking that I not walk so fast, but I can't get out of there fast enough.

I've no concrete point of reference to compare this film adaptation to, although the original television cult classic had been around for decades, lurking as this creaky pop culture trivia. But I thought the film instantly assumes a vibrant gothic presence and unveils a captivating introductory segment. In short strokes, this opening passage chronicles the establishing of a Maine fishing village in the 18th century and the life and death - and then undeath - of Barnabas Collins, scion of the founding Collins family. Barnabas Collins, who fails to love a comely witch and is cursed with vampirism. The villagers turn on him. They bury him in the dirt.

- Barnabas Collins: ""Tell me, future dweller, what is the year?""
- Willie Loomis: ""1972.""

Jackie Earle Haley (always reliable) plays Willie Loomis, butler to the present-day Collins clan and the first person Barnabas doesn't bite upon his release from entombment. Two hundred years (or, to be exact, 196 years) after being put in the ground, Barnabas bursts out of his coffin, shatters the chains encircling it, finds himself in today's modern era, in 1972. He makes a beeline for his ancestral home, now reduced to a dusty and dilapidated estate.

Barnabas encounters his distant descendants and worms his way into their ambivalent graces, passing himself off as a relative from overseas. Only Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), the stern matriarch, knows the truth of Barnabas. In the passing centuries, the family fortunes have plummeted. Barnabas vows to return the Collins family to its former stature of wealth and prominence. He doesn't know yet that he's set himself against a familiar supernatural presence. It's sort of apropos that in 1972 the Eagles released their single ""Witchy Woman.""

You eyeball this glittering lineup and assume that you're in for some powerhouse performances. Except that this unfolds mostly as a one man show. Johnny Depp is undeniably fabulous, and if that's all you're looking for in this flick, then you'll walk away sated. You have to allow for Depp's affectations, his character's arch mannerisms, those expressive, elongated fingers of his. You have to, I guess, allow for his character's lack of accountability. Barnabas pretty much gets away with murdering a bunch of people, but never mind, never mind. I frankly love what Depp does with this role. But then most everyone else follows suit, and that negates the effectiveness of what Depp was trying to do. Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, even Chlo Grace Moretz all submit such stylized performances that I had a problem relating to them. Only Eva Green, as the wicked and long-lived Angelique Bouchard, brings it with vivid energy and great enthusiasm. Down the centuries, the witch Angelique had become a powerufl and influential figure in this fishing community. Compelled by dark designs, she promptly renews acquaintances with the lover who once spurned her.

I admit to relishing the fish-out-of-water gags surrounding Barnabas' 18th century sensibilities colliding with the modern-day culture of 1972. He gazes, entranced, at a lava lamp, thinking it composed of blood and urine. He hangs out with hippies. He thinks the ""M"" on a MacDonald's stands for ""Mephistopholes."" But the best bit may be Alice Cooper's cameo at the ball, with Barnabas gazing at him thru opera glasses and muttering: ""Ugliest woman I have ever seen."" It's a shame the film denies us the thrill of a unique interaction between Barnabas and Alice. It's just one more missed opportunity.

I don't think Tim Burton can craft an ugly-looking film if his life depended on it. DARK SHADOWS is cinematically well-executed. It treats us to a series of sumptuous visuals. But it's hollow gratification, yo. The story suffers from poor character development, the lack of a narrative drive, the actors' languid approach, and an underdeveloped and absolutely unearned love story. About the last, Barnabas keeps refering to the slim governess he adores as possessing these ""fertile birthing hips,"" except that she totally doesn't, so what was he going on about? The campiness and sense of satire are so marked that they pretty much overwhelm whatever meager grounding the film has. I admire Depp's performance, but I don't care about his character. I don't care about any of these characters. I don't perceive them as anything but caricatures. Anyway, the narrative, ultimately, takes a back seat to Depp's doing his weird sh--. To cap off the awfulness of it all, things fall apart at the climax. Somewhere along this final sequence, the film even finds the nerve to drop a reveal about Chlo Grace Moretz's character that is jarring and comes out of left field. In the past few years Burton and Depp's collaboration has become a gimmicky thing. It's disconcerting that SLEEPY HOLLOW - the last film by these two that I've really enjoyed - is thirteen years old. I had such high hopes for this one. I love several things about this DARK SHADOWS. But I dislike so much more about it.",1337558400,6,5424,5.013318534961154

4977446,3,B00683T5CW,"This film is lightweight eye candy. Its the Tim Burton stock players going through the motions in yet another film. Its visually appealing. The casting isn't bad. But the plot and story are lame.

Vampire Barnabas Collins shows up after 200 years and encounters his 1970s era degenerate descendents. He proceeds to fix everything up in everyone's lives and then does battle with a witch. Too much of the film was spent on witch-related melodrama and action. Too little was spent on fixing up the family.

The visual jokes at Michael Jackson's expense were obvious but well done.

But they missed alot of good material in the original premise. Elizabeth Stoddard in the original had killed her husband and refused afterward to leave the house for years. In the film, she has no problems whatsoever. The original premise where a treasure-hunting Willy Loomis unearths the vampire was better. Roger and David they got generally right aside from having the ghosts david sees be only his mother. Carloine, aside from one thing done at the end, was probably an improvement on the original. Victoria Winters, for whatever reasons, comes across in the film as a shallow non-entity. They don't really use her at all. Dr. Julia Hoffman as a drunk was good in some scenes as a drunk, but then written off in a rather shallow way as a one-note joke.

Everything to do with Angelique is terrible. All the fishing industry competition stuff (Angel Bay) was a waste of time. The character is reduced to a obsessed stalker. Eva Green does the best she can with what she is given. But its not much.

Jackie Earl Haley turns in a good character preformance as Willie Loomis. Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a good performance in spite of the role not giving her all that much to do. Depp is good to a point but he is somewhat playing his stock character rather than doing anything interesting.

For all the good little bits in the film, they somehow missed the premise of the original material altogether. They had dark shadows and they decided to go for Mary Poppins. What they have done isn't bad. But its probably not worth looking at more than once.",1337212800,5,2130,4.712365591397849

I watched a few of the original episodes to psych myself up and to understand the storyline, but I couldn't get into it. Soap operas aren't my thing. After seeing the movie, it makes me wanna try and watch them. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a boring melodramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice.

In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Veronica Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to return the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!",1337126400,6,1713,4.616393442622951
4977450,3,B00683T5CW,"This movie bears as much resemblance to ""Dark Shadows"" the 60s cult classic as Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula does to Bram Stoker's novel. The characters are basically the same, as are the bare bones of the plot, ie. the Barnabas-Josette-Angelique-Hoffman love quadrangle, the vampire curse and Barnabas being locked away for almost 200 years. After that, however, it's a brand new story; people familiar with the original series should think of it as one of the alternative timeline cycles.

Johnny Depp is superb & Michelle Pfeiffer rocks as matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (just imagine Joan Bennett at the top of the stairs with a shotgun!). Collinwood itself is a character and is very grand; I love the study and entrance to the secret room. The character of Roger Collins has been maligned; it appears that they didn't know what to do with him, so made him a bad father and a thief. Carolyn is annoying as any teenager of the time, David is a non-entity and Maggie/Vickie just isn't given much to do (fans have got to love her openning scene on the train though). Dr Hoffman looks more like the original than anyone else. Angelique is turned from a witch who does incantations to a super-villain by the end, with way too much physical power.

Burton does not seem to have been able to make up his mind whether he was doing a drama, a light comedy or slapstick. It works best when the comedy is kept subtle, such as Barnabas' attempt to find a comfortable place to sleep. Many of the scenes are excellent, but some should have been left on the cutting room floor. The 2 sex scenes don't belong at all and the scene in the forest with the hippies slows the pace to a crawl without moving the plot forward.  Barnabas kills them all afterwards, apparently out of boredom because they certainly didn't give him any other motive. This is totally out of character, since he was neither starving or fighting for his life.

While the movie is very uneven in tone and pace and could use re-editting, I did enjoy it. Fans of the series who go into it with an open mind should find much to recommend it.

4977451,3,B00683T5CW,"MOVIE REVIEW #32 : "" Dark Shadows ""

Macabre genre director Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) has done it again! Taken the dark and the weird and melded them together in a creepy retelling of this old 1960's TV Soap Opera.

In 1966  Dark Shadows which recently lost its star Jonathan Frid  who played the original Barnabus Collins became the most popular daytime soap opera of its kind. Running for almost seven years, it became the staple of modern vampires as seen in the contemporary world.

Burton takes the reigns and uses light splashes of blood, super-human abilities....and hypnotic control and gives them to Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice In Wonderland, Neverland) who takes this character to creepy levels and beyond. His performance was amazing to watch. When he is on screen you can' take your eyes of him. Given a back story 200 years old...he tries to adjust to he year 1972....as well as anyone could coming from the year 1789.

Screenwriter Seth Jared Greenberg (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) took a long-winded approach to lead the audience through a slow beginning and  little lengthy middle to then really spice up action, magical effects with an incredibly bizarre characters...you would never want to meet.

Michelle Pfieffer (Hairspray, Scarface, Batman Returns), turns in a stoic performance as the Lady of the Collins house with two very different Collins children  - played by Gulliver McGrath (Hugo, Lincoln) as the gried stricken son and the daughter played by Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer, Hugo, Kick Ass) with a surprise secret!
The contrasting and memorable performance of a physiologist is played extremely creatively (if somewhat held back) by Mrs. Burton herself, Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Alice In Wonderland, The Corpse Bride). She is wickedly weird.

The movie is sprinkled with great character acting by the unique physical appearance of the creepy groundskeeper played by Jack Earl Haley (Watchman, Shutter Island, Loosin' It) and an obnoxious and annoying brother of Michelle Pfieffer played by Jonny Lee Miller (Trainspotting, Hackers).

Now the plot revolves around a sadistic, cruel and evil villainess that only the issue of LOVE could be the cause and the cure of this Collinsville Curse that exists....and has existed for two centuries. This villain  is seductively play by Eva Green (Casino Royale, The Golden Compass) with powers equal to - and in some parts - exceeding the vampire Barnabus Collins himself(Depp).

Besides Johnny Depps performance and that of Ms. Green's the best thing in the movie was the choices of the song hits on the year 1972. They are sewn in extremely well and you'll find yourself singing the tunes as you go. Not to take away from master composer himself, Danny Elfman (Batman, Milk, Real Steel) who compliments the vampires, action and enormous powers that flair out of these colorful characters.

I think it's a fun film with good performances by at least two of the cast and contains a great soundtrack. It does move slow at times and a lot of the story is catch up. I would have asked for more of the fish-out-of-water side of Depp in the year 1972 and less of the backstory of the evil villainess!

If you are a Depp or Burton fan - you'll love it. Bonham Carter is not allowed to expand much and if slow is your speed this is the film for you. Otherwise...you could wait for the video. I liked it more than I disliked it. You have to decide for yourself.",1336953600,2,3481,4.89625850340136

When I first heard that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were collaborating in making a Dark Shadows movie, I squealed like the biggest fan girl ever. Being both a huge fan both Burton and Depp while being a fan of Dark Shadows, I thought I was getting the best of both worlds.  When I started to see production photos slowly coming out, I thought they got it spot on, until that trailer came out... Disco music, comedy, really?  Still, I went this past Friday into the movie with no expectations..... And lets just say it's not the Dark Shadows your mother grew up with.

The movie starts out great with an original story line from the show.  Barnabas Collins and his family create Collinwood and Collinsport.  He then spurns the love a servant girl named Angelique and falls in love with another girl by the name of Jossette.  Angelique, being a witch, curses both of them.  Jossette falls to her death and Barnabas is turned into a Vampire.  He is then locked away in a chained coffin by angry mod, led by Angelique.

Fast forward 200 years.  Collinwood and Collinsport still stand.  The Collins family still endure with only a couple members remaining: Elizabeth Stoddard and her daughter Caroline, Elizabeth's brother Roger and his son David.  There's Willy Loomis, their groundskeeper, Mrs. Johnson, a maid (who served no purpose but to stand around and pretend to be an old crazy person), Dr. Julia Hoffman, David's always drunken slosh psychiatrist, and soon they're joined by Victoria Winters (aka Maggie Evans) who comes on as David's governess.  Already, Vicki's character is pushed into the wayside many times in the film, although you would assume she would have a bigger part as being the reincarnation of Jossette.  She only appears when it suits Barnabas' scenes.

Depp's Barnabas awakens in 1972 by a construction crew building a Mcdonalds.  Already starts the downfall from here.  Instead of being the serious Barnabas in the opening of the film, Depp plays him as a bumbling fool, all wigged out about all the ""weird"" things he sees along the way (the giant glowing McDonalds M, cars, lava lamps, etc.)  In the television show, Barnabas had put Willy under control and then seemingly planted himself in place with no issues and charm the Collins family in letting him stay at Collinwood.  Never did they know he was a vampire either, as they spill in this movie.

Another character dynamic they got all wrong was that of Dr. Hoffman.  In the television show, she was a doctor that dealt blood diseases, thus trying to always cure Barnabas of his curse.  She was always the voice of concern and did develop a friendship with Barnabas. Helena Carter's portrayal is far from the loving doctor we know, where she is constantly drunk, uses sexual favors to get what she wants and instead of finding a cure for Barnabas, she has other plans on how to use his blood.

You find out later on that the Collins are almost broke due to another company called Angel Bay.  You can see where this is going.  Angel could be short for Angelique maybe?  Eva Green did Lara Parker a grave injustice by portraying Angelique as some sad, desperate slut who happens to be a witch.  Hilarity ensues, there's conflict, and a big climatic ending.

My biggest beef with this film is while it made many references to the television show, Burton and Depp had made this more of a campy comedy rather than a serious soap opera.  Granted the television show was know for it's very campy drama and occasional bloopers in scenes.  But it still managed to be serious when it needed to be.  I think the biggest mistake was to let Seth Grahame-Smith (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) write the screenplay.  He's know for writing humorous spoofs and that's what he did with this. Sure it had it's moments, but to do that through out was a mistake.  Another thing that was wrong was all the ""surprises"" they made.  Caroline turns into a werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling the audience to ""deal with it.""  Okay sorry, I wanted to cry foul and not deal it.  It was lame.

The only thing rewarding about this film was the performances of Jackie Earl Haley (Willie) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth).  Even Belle Heathcote (Victoria) had a great performance, it's ashame they didn't give her more.

Out of all the Burton/Depp movies, this one was my least favorite.  That's very hard to say, considering I love all of the films they've made over the years.  It had so much potential, but they ruined it.  I prefer my cheezy soap opera.  It's like they made 2 different movies, one serious and one humorous.  They should've worked more on it, made it serious and released it on Halloween.  Would've been more fitting that way.",1336953600,22,4725,4.721271393643032
4977454,3,B00683T5CW,"Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp team up again for yet another version of their quirkiness.  OK, we get it.  While I never watched the ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera, I understand it was not supposed to be humorous.  So when transplanted to the screen should it have been more serious?  Eh, maybe not.  But at least make up your mind.

The movie begins with something similar to Coppala's version of ""Dracula"" (1992) where Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed by a witch around 1776 for spurning her love for another.  He becomes a vampire but is soon captured and buried in a silver chained coffin.  Nearly 200 years later the coffin is uncovered at a construction site and Barnabas is set free.  He finds his old homestead is in a poor state and that his fishing enterprise has floundered and replaced by a witchy descendent of Angelique (Eva Green).  Spoiler alert:  The witch is the same person, but has aged well.

Barnabas confides in the current head of the household Elizabeth (a still stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) of his secret but doesn't ""come out"" to the others until later.  The house is filled with off kilter children (Chloe Moretz and Gulliver McGrath) and even weirder adult staffers (Jackie Earle Haley, Helena Bonham Carter and Ray Shirley).  Then of course there is the beautiful Bella Heathcote as Victoria, the reincarnation of Barnabas original love from 1776 who was offed by an Angelique spell.

The film is full of some excellent photography and well used CGI but it continually bogs down.  Full of fits and starts, it can't make up its mind what kind of movie it is supposed to be.  I did think the scene where Barnabas can't resist the amorous advances of Angelique to be pretty good.  And we do learn with certainty that when a vampire has sex, bedrooms are destroyed (see ""True Blood"" and ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn"" for further proof).  Although the ending includes an opening for a sequel, I wouldn't bet on it.",1336867200,2,1941,4.740298507462686
4977455,4,B00683T5CW,"I attended a midnight premiere of this film and I absolutely love it! Though I'm not a diehard Burton fan, I greatly enjoy his work and though she is one of my favorite actresses, it's nice not to see Burton's off-screen partner (Helena Bonham Carter) as a leading lady in one of his films, for once.

Eva Green is wonderful as Angelique Bouchard. Burton's ""Angie"" doesn't feign innocence as Lara Parker did the the '60s, but that WORKS for this eccentric director's adaptation. Johnny Depp is his usual charismatic, charming self and even Michelle Pfeiffer is surprisingly pleasing as Elizabeth Stoddard.

Growing up, my mother loved Dark Shadows and relayed to me that she found it ""pretty good."" Of course, she's not a wacko Dark Shadows fan who borders on ""STAN"" tendencies, unable to adapt to change or cope with implemented differences in the slightest. I've seen a number of episodes and it's no wonder it became a cult classic. If you loved the original and can adapt to change without being overly discriminatory, congratulations, this is a film for you! If not, I'd strongly advise you steer clear from the 2012 version--especially while it's in theaters! Please, don't risk huffing, puffing, and grunting as you'll in all likelihood ruin the experience for others.

In praising this work, it's obviously not flawless. Chloe Grace Moretz is an utter bore (I'd literally be more inclined to watch grass grow) and it's a mystery why Tim Burton cast her. Bella Heathcote is, for lack of a better word, ""interesting"" as Victoria Winters. I sometimes felt as if her lines were spoken too monotonously. The penultimate scenes feel a bit rushed and I certainly did not appreciate the fate of Angelique (of course, knowing this is a Tim Burton film,  he may have us all fooled). And the final scene definitely implies an imminent sequel.

In closing, Dark Shadows is a breath of a fresh air--a great film to see in a summer when other flicks appear to be lackluster at best, cliche or the last in their franchise. Tim Burton's latest is true to form (perceived as ""over-the-top"") surely has moments forcing viewers to narrow eyes in amazement, curiosity and bewilderment but for the most part, it's visually stunning with unbridled wit, dry (and blatant) humor and surprises that will keep you talking for days!",1336867200,3,2313,4.875318066157761
4977456,3,B00683T5CW,"I consider myself a Tim Burton fan, but even I will admit that he has had more stinkers than gems over the last decade. This is somewhere in the middle. Johnny Depp, in his eight outing with Burton, turns in his typical weird creation, but I really enjoyed him in this vampire role. Eva Green makes for a sexy villain. The rest of the cast, set design, atmosphere and 70's tunes are strong as well, but the story really goes nowhere. There are some clever gags and dialogue that kept things interesting, so I was never truly bored. I liked enough about it to say that Dark Shadows is worth a Blu-ray rental. Go see The Avengers again or save your money for The Dark Knight Rises.",1336867200,3,679,4.354330708661418
4977457,2,B00683T5CW,"I saw this the Friday before Mother's Day.  Judging from the reactions of the moms I saw with their kids as they were coming out of the theater, few were wowed by this movie. Nor was I.  My fellow audience members, so jovial as they filed in, took seats and watched the previews, were dead silent throughout the whole of ""Dark Shadows.""  There were a few wan chuckles here and there, but that was it.  Maybe you have to be a fan of the original series which predates me.

Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, a non-sparkly vampire who's been placed under a curse and trapped in a coffin for almost 200 years. Accidentally released, he returns to the coastal town of Collinwood, founded by his forebears, to help his family ""restore the business to its former glory.""  Michelle Pfeffer plays the matriarch, and her facial expression does not change one iota during the course of the film, though she, like the rest of the cast, does her best with the cringe-worthy dialogue and minimal character development.  Depp, who only subsists on other people's blood because he has no choice, must deal with the witch who placed him under the curse, who he finds strangely attractive. Competition for her comes in the form of the new family governess (Bella Heathcote) and child psychiatrist (Helena Bonham Carter) who both develop feelings for Barnabas.

Subtlety is not the film's strong point.  Example: Depp returns from the dead, and we get to see a cinema ad for the movie ""Superfly,"" while lyrics with that word prominently featured also play. When he devours someone, it's mostly not shown, but then we get him in the following scene looking like a ketchup packet has just exploded over his face.  Storylines are dropped abruptly, many characters are under-used, and it ends with a rather cheesy battle between good and evil. Fans of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp may enjoy it, but I'd need to be hypnotized, much like Carter does Depp, before seeing it a second time.",1336780800,7,1962,4.7441176470588236

Johnny Depp did a great job as Barnabas.  It was great to still hear Jonathan Frid's voice in the narration!  Barnabas coming back into 1972 was surprising how he had to get used to the changes.  It made us laugh and still remember the old days with what Barnabas went through when we watched it in the earlier days.
After watching it as a young girl and purchasing the whole set (receiving it as a Christmas gift) and getting my husband into it, we both were very happy with the movie.  We knew how the show ended excellently.  The movie continued where it left off, adding some laughter but again an excellent ending.",1336780800,6,704,4.426356589147287
4977460,4,B00683T5CW,"I was a big fan of the original show back in my high school years.  I was madly in love with Lara Parker's Angelique. Yes, she was totally evil, but one look into those big blue eyes and I forgave her for everything.

One month ago I bought a limited edition set of the entire series and started watching from the beginning, at the rate of about 10 episodes per day (I'm retired, so I have the time to do this) and I'm enjoying it all over again (although I have yet to reach the point at which I started watching it in the first place in November 1967).

That being said, I saw the movie yesterday and greatly enjoyed it. The trailer made the mistake of focusing solely on the sillier elements of the film and skipping all the better parts.  I found it to be far more respectful of the source material than the trailer indicated, with many references that only a fan would recognize (like young Maggie Evans getting carted off to Windcliff Sanitarium).  Even the over-the-top revelations during the final conflict refer to some of the many weird storylines that occurred in Collinwood over the show's run.  Eva Green looked like she was having a ball as the delightfully wicked and passionate ""Angie.""

Dark Shadows is ultimately an inconsequential bit of entertainment, but it was a lot of fun and gorgeous to look at.

But there will never be an Angelique like Lara Parker, still beautiful even in her seventies as can be seen in the brief view of her entering the party along with Jonathan Frid, David Selby, and Kathryn Leigh Scott (also still very attractive).",1336780800,5,1566,4.548042704626335

4977462,2,B00683T5CW,"They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and...oh, that's another crazy horror TV family. Dark Shadows has managed to achieve some measure of cult status thanks to its quirky, macabre premise, more so than for any claim to being good. It was unique at least, as fairly serious goth soap operas featuring monsters and parallel universes are kinda hard to come by nowadays. You won't have to look hard to find the yearly Dark Shadows Festival, and the show has been attempted as a remake on more than one occasion. They all failed. Let's face it, remaking a series that seems to defy typical genre conventions is a tough act. Since most people have no clue what the heck Dark Shadows was, and a TV series is a proven failure, what's the best way to make use of this niche property? Make a movie out of it.

Unfortunately that seems to be the only consideration at play in this tired and disappointing version of Dark Shadows, made even worse by the presence of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who on paper would seem to be the perfect fit. Over the years, Burton has strayed further away from original material, shutting off much of his creative genius in order to bring to life the vision of others, and this would be the best evidence that all those years away have caused him to lose his touch. The same goes for Depp, who in his eighth collaboration(!!!) with Burton has fallen into the same comfortable formula as him. Burton appears perfectly happy to apply his talents to substandard, franchise friendly material. Depp, who has spent more time playing goofball characters than actual human beings, has reached the point where it looks as if he's not even trying anymore.

This Dark Shadows bears many of the hallmarks of the original series, Burton-ized for maximum marketability. That's not to say that making an obviously mainstream film is a bad thing. It's just that what made Burton so special is that he could do it without it ever feeling like he was compromising his artistic vision. Those days, sadly, are gone, traded in for half-hearted love triangles and lazy culture clash jokes sprinkled with spiffy 1970s rock tunes. The film begins promisingly in 1760, where the Collins clan have uprooted themselves and moved to Maine, where they began a thriving seafood company that powers the entire town's economy. They're so beloved that the town actually becomes known as Collinsport, but that's about where all the good cheer ends. Young Barnabas Collins(Depp) has become the object of desire of their servant girl, Angelique(Eva Green), and he has given in to passion with her on numerous occasions, even though he has found true love with the beautiful Josette(Bella Heathcote). When Barnabas tries to break things off with Angelique, she gets revenge by casting a murderous spell on Josette, destroying the Collins family, and cursing Barnabas as a vampire. Oh, and then she has him buried alive.

Fast forward a couple of hundred years to 1972, and the Collins family is still feeling the effects of Angelique's curse. The once stately Collins Manor has fallen into disarray, broken and disheveled. The family business is in tatters, with the surviving Angelique using the years to take over the seafood industry for herself, sending the Collins' into ruin. All that remains of the family are a handful of heirs with secrets and quirks galore: the regal matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard(Michelle Pfeiffer); her insufferable, gold-digging brother(Johnny Lee Miller); the rebellious teenage daughter, Carolyn(Chloe Moretz); and the troubled 10-year old son, David(Gully McGrath). Things begin to turn around with the arrival of Victoria Winters(Heathcote again) as the new governess, who happens to be the spitting image of Josette. When Barnabas is accidentally unearthed from his grave(and promptly slaughters everyone nearby), he rejoins the family and sets out to restore them to their greater glory.

Of course it won't be easy, especially when Barnabas quickly falls for Victoria, and she seems drawn mysteriously to him. Like a replay from their youth, Angelique jealously does everything in her power to steal Barnabas away, inciting a rivalry between her and the Collins clan that threatens to consume the town. What could have been a hilarious and spirited war between supernatural foes, mixed with Burton's freakish flair for the dramatic, turns out to be a one-note affair. Much of the humor derives for Barnabas's inability to adapt to modern times, spazzing out over the ""tiny songstress"" singing on the television. He's generally lost in the cultural freedom of the time period, although he seems to have the ""free love"" ideal down pretty well. Burton, along with horror novelist turned screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith(Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), mine the fish out of water humor for all it's worth. They're actually quite funny for awhile, but like most of Depp's impersonations they wear thin really quick. It doesn't help that the rest of the Collins clan are basically ignored, seen only when reacting to some misstep Barnabas has made. Moretz, a fantastic and mature young actress is badly miscast as Carolyn, a vampy bit of jailbait with a snotty attitude and great ""birthing hips"". Not even Helena Bonham Carter, such a staple and a highlight of many Burton movies, has much to do here as the family psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman. The most interesting thing about her, other than the momentary ""fling"" she has with the over-sexed Barnabas, is her blazing scarlet hair. Only Eva Green's busty and sinful performance as Angelique has any hint of life to it. She can curse me anytime she wants. We just aren't given much of a reason to care about anybody, and that includes Barnabas.

The fundamental problem is the inability to blend the show's campy, soap opera elements with Burton's rather specific sort of black comedy. The tone is all over the map, from dark and rather vicious, to downright silly. Sometimes this can be a good thing, and Burton has shown many times he can usually find a way to make these elements work in perfect harmony. He never pulls it off here, though, and a big part of the problem is Graham-Smith's haphazard writing. Having read both of his popular, genre mash-up novels, that inconsistency is a recurring theme. He's a writer with a lot of cool ideas but little clue how to pull them off. That fits what happens to Dark Shadows to a tee. There's so much potential here, from the concept to the cast, that it's aggravating to sit and watch it go absolutely nowhere. At least it looks like a Burton film. He certainly hasn't lost his touch for art and production design.

Burton and Depp have stated in the past how they were huge fans of theTV series, and it's mainly due to them that this film exists. They must've only really enjoyed the occasional episode or two, because it quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea where a Dark Shadows movie should lead. Clocking in at a ponderous 113 minutes, you start to feel every second of it, and the ending indicates the possibility of sequels. Rather than going in that direction, maybe Burton and Depp should just get together and pop in the Blu-Rays for a weekend marathon.",1336694400,6,7208,4.923519736842105

Directed by Tim Burton.

***June 27, 2016 marks the 50th Anniversary of ""Dark Shadows"".

The House of Dark Shadows is Alive. Woof!
I appreciate Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revitalizing Dark Shadows again for those of us middle-aged and seniors who enjoyed the original Dark Shadows soap opera (1966-71) in our younger days. Perhaps this movie will open some new doors and obtain new fans.
 Dark Shadows (1966-71) is still more popular than ever. The DVD Collections are selling like hot cakes.
  After seeing Sleepy Hollow (1991) and Alice in Wonderland (2010), I then got the idea of what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp might do with Dark Shadows (2012).  It was very different and tried to be more of a comedy to honor the 1970's and the Dark Shadows story.
  The movie opens giving us a brief history of the Collins family and how this town of Collinsport was built up by the Collins Family. Now it's 1972 and Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) is at first taking a train ride and then having to hitch a ride to the Collinwood Estate. The song ""Nights in White Satin"" by Moody Blues, is played to help us get in the mood.
  A chained coffin is excavated deep underground from where one of Angelique's building projects will be constructed. A workman breaks the chains from around the coffin and the strong power of Barnabas Collins is unleashed. Everyone is killed at the construction site. Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has been locked away for 195 years and has an incredible thirst for human blood. You see he is a vampire. For the first time, Barnabas sees a McDonald's Restaurant and a paved road with an automobile. He makes his way back to the Collinwood Estate.

 This movie includes the cameo appearance of four original cast members of  Dark Shadows (ABC, 1966-71). Jonathan Frid (""Barnabas Collins""), Kathryn Leigh Scott (""Maggie""), Lara Parker (""Angelique"") and David Selby (""Quentin"").

 My eyes were focused on Jonathan Frid and Kathryn Leigh Scott and although they were together, Lara Parker and David Selby went by too fast for me to see clearly. They should have let them stop and all say a few lines so they could be seen real good on film.

 How interesting to note that Jonathan Frid became popular with his first appearance as ""Barnabas Collins"" in Dark Shadows in 1967 and his final role was in this ""Dark Shadows"" movie. He made his exit stage left. He passed away April 14, 2012 at the age of 87...27 days before this film's release.

 Christopher Lee also has a small role whom was known in his prime as Dracula, Prince of Darkness.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-Prince-of-Darkness-The-Satanic-Rites-of-Dracula/dp/B0000W5H7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula Prince of Darkness/The Satanic Rites of Dracula</a>.

 Alice Cooper sings a couple songs from his heyday in the 1970's.

 Everyone has their own opinion of how a new Dark Shadows movie could be. I would like to add my 2 cents worth.
  I don't think it was necessary for Johnny Depp to wear the white make-up at all. He could have played ""Barnabas"" with his own natural face and skin tone and it would have worked.

 I didn't care for Jackie Earle Haley as ""Willie"" and thought it would have been great if the original ""Willie"" from the tv series could have played ""Willie"" again. Karlen did played ""Willie"" again in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Dark-Shadows/dp/B0012DP6L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;(1970) and ""Alex Jenkins"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Of-Dark-Shadows/dp/B002SP75TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Of Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;(1971).

Eva Green you know as ""Vesper Lynd"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-HD/dp/B00946WM6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale [HD</a>] (2006) and now the Penny Dreadful tv series (Showtime, 2014-present)

 They made ""Carolyn"" a girl of 15 years old in this version. I thought Chloe Grace Moretz did a wonderful job and I think we will be seeing much more of her as an actress in her adult years to come.

 I wanted so much to hear Michelle Pfeiffer say ""Meow"" in this film, but not even close.

 Jonny Lee Miller is the grandson of Bernard Lee who played ""M"" in the James Bond movies in 1962-1979. Jonny is now on Elementary (CBS, 2012-present) as a modern-day ""Sherlock Holmes"".

 Dark Shadows was broadcast on the ABC Network before or after ""General Hospital"" in your area. In the end, in 1971, they wanted to replace it with the ""Password"" game show.

 Others played ""Barnabas"", Ben Cross in Dark Shadows (1990-91) and Alec Newman in an unaired pilot in 2004.
If they were to ever make a serious ""Dark Shadows"", I have wondered how soap opera actor Victor Irizarry would have faired.

 This 2012 movie does have its faults, but if they wanted to make a Dark Shadows Part 2, I would go see it.

4977464,2,B00683T5CW,"I have to admit I am both a big fan of the original series and Tim Burton. I think ""Alice in Wonderland"" was one of the best movies I've seen in my whole lifetime. Loved ""Sweeney Todd,""and I generally have a very high regard for Mr. Burton's work. But this movie, comparisons with the original series aside, is just plain awful. It lacks plot, and seems to be anchored down by its attempts to make references to the original series.

I guess the really frustrating thing here is if you were going to reach back to the original series for material there were at least 8000 storylines & subplots that you could have drawn from. Unfortunately Seth Graham Greene chose to disregard all of those and gave us a sophomoric script that's a combination between the TV series Dallas and the previous Burton movie Beetlejuice. Seriously, the goings-on between Angelique and Barnabas remind me of the antics and sibling rivalry between Bobby Ewing and JR Ewing. As hard as Johnny Depp tries to make the material work, he just can't.

Anybody older than 12 is going to be totally annoyed by Chloe Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard. There's just absolutely nothing likable about this character and nothing in her performance to make you care one lick about what happens to her or the rest of the family. Eva Green is totally miscast as Angelique, and Michelle Pfeiffer - who is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood - seems to be completely wasted on this material. That goes double for Helena Bonham Carter.

The movie does have a couple of nice moments. Watching the opening titles with Victoria Winters riding a train into Collinwood, set to the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin""was sort of breathtaking. And surprisingly, Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis is the bright spot in this mess of a movie. He truly is funny and got some belly laughs... more than once.

I don't know who to be madder at. Seth Graham Greene, or Tim Burton. But I waited 50 years for someone to do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer. No one seems to have figured out that one of the reasons the original series worked is there were always two story lines going at the same time. It never was all about Barnabas Collins. There was Elizabeth Stoddard and Jason Maguire. And then there was Barnabas and Maggie Evans. The interplay between the two story lines is what made the series so interesting.  In the 1700s it was Barnabas and Angelique, and Vicky and Peter Bradford, and I can go on. Etc. etc.

They used  the excuse that they needed to update the story for modern audience. I am insulted. Next time, How about a little bit of imagination and ingenuity?",1336694400,6,2675,4.59538784067086

Johnny Depp does a terrific job playing Barnabas and Eva Green does such an amazing job playing Angelique that you can't help but to love her evil character.  The funny parts are hilarious and the menacing parts are just so wicked.  The final showdown at the end of the movie is one of the best I've ever seen.,1336694400,4,336,4.387096774193548
4977466,2,B00683T5CW,"I think most people can agree that Tim Burton movies have gone downhill in recent years, but I think I tend to enjoy them a bit more than everyone else. While ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" fail in comparison to the likes of ""Beetlejuice"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and ""Sleepy Hollow"", they're still pretty entertaining at face value. ""Dark Shadows"" has been rubbing everyone the wrong way ever since that first trailer was released and revealed that the original gothic soap opera from 1966 was now more of a comedic fantasy. Even after viewing the movie, giving a definite opinion of ""Dark Shadows"" is still rather difficult.

I didn't follow the original series, but I had my doubts about the movie right from the start. Johnny Depp looked really awkward as Barnabas Collins. If you just look at Barnabas, he appears to be an emo Nosferatu. The comedy felt like it didn't belong in a film like this. It was as if Dracula went to the school of slapstick comedy and decided to run around throwing cream pies and squirting everyone in the face with a seltzer water bottle instead of biting them on the neck and either feasting on their blood or turning them into a creature of the night.

""Dark Shadows"" is somewhat surprising though. Witnessing the whole McDonalds sponsorship scene was a bit painful, but that scene that takes place where Barnabas awakens in 1972 is when the movie illustrates that it is capable of getting dark and violent. Hell, it may even show a little blood every once in awhile. The humor is very ridiculous throughout, but there are quite a few innuendos and a handful of sex jokes that you may not be expecting. There's an entire conversation revolving around balls, a scene where Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) goes down on Barnabas, a pair of panties being shoved and left in Barnabas' face for an extended period of time, and one of the most awkward sex scenes to be released on the big screen that is even more ""regrettable"" than Barnabas says it is.

Most of the humor that hits its mark the most involves the outdated speaking method that Barnabas uses. His fascination with ""fertile birthing hips,"" the way he keeps referring to Alice Cooper as a hideous woman, and his fantastically longwinded insults are easily the highlight of the character. Chloe Grace Moretz is fairly entertaining, as well. That could just be because she reminds me of my cousin who wishes she was born in the seventies, but her screen time certainly didn't feel like it was wasted.

""Dark Shadows"" is this really bizarre excuse of a movie. Some moments are pretty funny and others are fairly clever, but that's where the movie's charm ends. Everything is overly goofy, ridiculous, and too over the top to be completely coherent. Imagine trying to mix a fruit salad and a garden salad. That weird concoction is pretty much what ""Dark Shadows"" is to the film world. The fantastical comedy isn't really good or downright awful, but you can't really describe it as anything other than ""meh."" Despite some interesting performances from the entire cast, everything just feels kind of thrown together without much chemistry or purpose.",1336694400,14,3189,4.813868613138686
4977467,5,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton's Dark Shadows 2012 (DS12) ranks right up there for me with Mel Brooks's 1974 masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Frankenstein/dp/B000G6BLWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Frankenstein</a>, which is a hilarious parody of Universal Studios's horror movies of the 1930's, something that DS12 does, at least indirectly, as well. I personally rank this show 4 stars for script, 5 stars for CGI special effects, 5 stars for the elaborate sets by production designer Rick Heinrichs, and 5 stars for the beautiful costumes designed by Colleen Atwood. Most of all I give 5+ stars to the actors, in particular Johnny Depp. His acting is always wonderful, but it is a real joy for anyone who loves comedy to see him in a comedic part. He is a master at subtle nuances of expression, making him outstanding as either the one delivering the comic lines, or the straight man receiving them. To me, he is the best part of this film, but it is also a great pleasure to see so many talented supporting actors in the film, especially Eva Green, whose performance is terrific as the villain, Angelique Bouchard, an evil witch.

The afternoon soap opera,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows/dp/B007PZ6SYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;(DSTV), on which this film is based, ran on network TV from 1966-1971. Its central character is a handsome vampire, Barnabas Collins, who was portrayed with equal parts anguish and menace by talented actor, Jonathan Frid. His central role is reprised in DS12 by Depp, who has a long, successful history with the film's director, Tim Burton (a partial list of their teamwork includes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-Scissorhands/dp/B00004U8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward Scissorhands</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ed-Wood/dp/B0000VD04M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ed Wood</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd/dp/B001BN1ZHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd</a>, Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepy-Hollow/dp/0792164903/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepy Hollow</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). During the era it was broadcast, DSTV offered its audience an excitingly bizarre mishmash of vampires, witches and werewolves like nothing anyone had ever seen on TV or even in films. In their youth, both Burton and Depp were big fans of the show, and Burton claims it had a major impact on the type of films he would make later in life.

DS12 does not try to repeat what DSTV accomplished but rather expands on it. In a fun homage, DS12 is set in the same era as the TV series itself, beginning in 1972, the year after DSTV ended. Burton draws on the classic American tale, Rip Van Winkle, for his plot (a story written by Washington Irving, the 19th-century author on whose work Burton based his film, Sleepy Hollow). Like poor Rip, Barnabas (Depp) is condemned to a long ""sleep."" In his case, the evil witch Angelique, in punishment for rich, 18th-century playboy Barnabas's breaking her heart, turns him into a vampire and buries him in a coffin for a sleep ten times as long as Rip's enchanted slumber in a mountain meadow. Like Rip, when Barnabas escapes his magical imprisonment, he discovers the world he knew has vanished. Instead of staid 1772 (which is also Rip's era), it is now psychedelic, disco-ridden 1972. Barnabas seeks out his ancestral home and learns that the once magnificent estate is now in ruins, and his seriously dysfunctional descendants are strongly in need of his assistance to rebuild the family fortune. They include matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer), her debauched brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), her insolent teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), and Roger's unstable, young son David (Gulliver/Gully McGrath). The household also includes a meek governess, Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote), an alcoholic caretaker, Willie (Jackie Earle Haley), a senile servant, Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley), and a drunken psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter who, as Tim Burton's wife, is in all his movies).

At its peak, DSTV enjoyed a large and loyal following of 20 million fans. It hit the airwaves immediately following the close of two successful comedic monster-movie parodies, The Munsters (1964-1966) and The Addams Family (1964-1966). However, DSTV gained far higher ratings than either of those shows and ran over twice as long, perhaps because DSTV's approach to horror was melodramatic instead of comedic.

The Munsters and The Addams Family can obviously be included in the rich tradition of horror parody in motion picture form, starting as early as the 1940's with movies such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), but many fans of DSTV, who regard the show with utmost seriousness, object to anyone characterizing DSTV as a monster parody. However, the stars of DSTV state that the show's attitude toward horror themes was actually, if not comedic, definitely impudent. Actor David Selby, who played Quentin in DSTV, states, ""Fans who are upset [at Burton for creating a campy parody of the show] have to remember that when we made the series, we screwed with beloved monster movies and turned them upside down! We were hardly reverent ourselves."" This sentiment is seconded by Lara Parker, who played Angelique in DSTV.

Burton shows his intention to honor DSTV, not mock it, by dedicating the film to Dan Curtis, DSTV's creator who is now deceased. In addition, Burton cast many of the stars of DSTV in cameos, including Frid, who died very recently at age 87, Selby, Parker, and Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played Josette. All of these actors have been strong supporters of the film.

Burton also cast 90-year-old Christopher Lee in a small part in DS12, as a nod to Lee's famous portrayal of the prototype vampire from literature,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Count-Dracula/dp/B000JQUBRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Count Dracula</a>, in multiple movies in the 60's and 70's, the same era as DSTV.

To insure he had the best writer to achieve the approach he wanted to take with this film, Burton hired best-selling novelist Seth Grahame-Smith, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-and-Zombies/dp/1594743347/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</a>, to do the screenplay. The two of them have also worked together on another spoofy vampire movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which is set to release within a month of this movie, in June, 2012. Burton co-produced that film, which is based on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/1455510173/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;of the same name by Grahame-Smith, who wrote that film's screenplay as well.",1336694400,8,7285,6.192687747035573
4977468,5,B00683T5CW,"Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins, who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's.  The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly.  The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over-acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. On a scale of 1-5 I would give this film 6 stars because it far surpassed my expectations! Be sure to see Dark Shadows in a theater near you with all of your friends!! Review by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic (14)",1336608000,6,1963,4.573863636363637
4977469,5,B00683T5CW,"Tim Burton has directed one of his finest works in years with his revival of the 1960's cult-classic soap opera ""Dark Shadows"". In this film Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, who, like in the original soap opera, awakens after 200 years from his coffin to find things have changed drastically around him. This is as far as the film goes with its resemblance to the series. What Burton has done is make a film that is a comedy, campy motion picture that is aimed for 2012 audiences. I am sure that people will love the movie as Burton is known for his somewhat strange approach to movie making, however fans of the beloved soap opera, like me, will be sad to see that the dramatic elements of the soap opera are not here and that the movie plays for laughs.

 Johnny Depp gives a good performance as Barnabas, although I am not crazy about his make-up. He's funny, at times stupid and simply a caricature of the real Barnabas, but he's great playing a funny part. In the film Barnabas comes back to life in 1972 shocked to see how his world has changed and to see his latest members of his family. He also runs into the witch that put a curse on him 200 years before and they somehow get together again. Barnabas also helps out his family with financial trouble as they try to rebuild their empire.

 I really love the special effects the movie employs, something the soap opera had a hard time to do on their tight network budget. If your looking for a fun time and a good laugh ""Dark Shadows"" with Johnny Depp will make you hysterical. But if your looking for a movie that is dramatic and close to the original ABC series you will be disappointed. Still, I am grateful the movie, opening in theatres May 11th, 2012, has brought a renewed interest in the soap opera and that an entire new generation of people who don't know about the Collins family or Branabas or Angelique will want to know how these characters got their start.

 The movie became a solidified hit on opening weekend coming in at #2 with a whopping $28 million dollars at the box office in North America alone. Together with its international gross the film made nearly $70 million.",1333411200,50,2156,4.459390862944162
