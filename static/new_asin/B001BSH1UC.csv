When a series becomes successful it tends to follow a formula. After a while viewers tend to drift away for a change. The producers react to this by changing the formula. If it doesnt increase the number of viewers the series will end. One change is to add or drop actors or characters to see if this increases viewers. There are few series that go over nine years without some type of changes. Other factors can affect a series. Actors may become unavailable, fashions change. Do these stories follow the path set in the earlier seasons? Here are the titles of the 24 episodes.
