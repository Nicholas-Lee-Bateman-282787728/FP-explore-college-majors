8649222,5,B00JAC900K,"The Last Waltz catches you and sets your mind and body dancing whether you were there then or just wish you were. The music is of the highest caliber without being precious or seeming retro. It is a beautiful collection that will likely go down as a class. I would definitely recommend it for the music, for the singing and harmony and for the time it captures.",1400284800,2,361,4.402985074626866
