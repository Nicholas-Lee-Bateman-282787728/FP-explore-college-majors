2410053,4,B000BB18WC,"The movie is excellent if you are a Gaspard Ulliel fan but for those that are not, it lacks a climax. The lack of climax works with the script, but proves to be quite boring to watch a movie that leads to nothing. I suggest that this movie either be bought by Gaspard fans or Garcia fans, because unless you like either one or the other, you will not be able to finish watching the movie.",1176336000,2,388,4.118421052631579
2410054,5,B000BB18WC,"... this is your movie because he developes a very enigmatic and attractive performance in a simple but captivating movie. The best of the movie by far, from my perspective, is that Gaspard Ulliel looks like one of the most beautiful guys on the world (the camera falls in love with him, I assure you). And you don't even need to see the movie itself because just the images of him on the main menu of the dvd can be a total delight for your eyes. Pure beauty, beautiful (but sad) story and... even sadder ending. I guess the ending is necessary to get the ultimate flavour of the script but.... it's better not to watch it if you are in one of those very, very happy days!! Ideal movie for a quite night with a grey day or rain outside. And of course, essential movie for Gaspard Ulliel fans like me. You won't be disappointed.",1170547200,15,828,4.314102564102564
2410055,4,B000BB18WC,"Rodolphe Marconi ('Love Forbidden') is a director and writer to watch.  He has a signature style already (he is quite young in the industry) and knows how to use that sensitivity to tell touching stories. LE DERNIER JOUR or THE LAST DAY is a mood piece, spare on dialogue, misty in its depiction of young emotional feelings, challenging in its play with time devices, and ultimately very satisfying for those who enjoy the French manner of film making.

Simon (the very handsome and gifted young actor Gaspard Ulliel of 'A Very Long Engagement') boards a train bound for the coast where he is to spend time in his family's seaside cabin. Most of his ride is spent gazing out the windows at the misty countryside, telling us more about this lonely, lost, vulnerable young eighteen year boy than a thousand words.  On the train is a young girl Louise (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) who seems to be shadowing him.  When Simon arrives home he is met by his loving mother Marie (Nicole Garcia), his sister Alice (Alysson Paradis) and his father Jean-Louis (Christophe Malavoy).  Louise joins Simon as a guest in his home and his family thinks the two are a couple. Though they sleep in the same bed, Simon's mind and longing are for a lad who lives in the lighthouse, Mathieu (Thibault Vinon). Simon visits Mathieu, with Louise not far behind, and though we feel a kinship between the two boys, Louise forces her attention on Mathieu and Simon becomes a third party.  In a telling moment when the three are in a pub Louise insists that Simon and Mathieu kiss, and that kiss tells a lot about the current state of mind of both boys.  Simon becomes isolated, longs for Mathieu who has moved on from their past relationship, an emotional level which is culminated in a visit to Mathieu's home where Simon, alone on Mathieu's bed, re-visits the passion and lust and love for Mathieu in a scene of radiant beauty.

Simon's parents argue at all time and this leads to the discovery of a previous affair his mother had, an affair which holds secrets that drive a stake into Simon's relationship to Louise and to his mother's lover Pierre (Daniel Berbioux) who as he visits the mother uncovers significant mysteries. The story ends tragically in a coda suggestive of the beginning of the film.  It is stunning.

For some the sparse dialogue may prevent the storyline from driving clearly, but in the hands, eyes, and body of Gabriel Ulliel  words are wholly unnecessary.  If there were no other reason to see this very sensitive film, having the opportunity to observe the talented Ulliel would be sufficient.  Recommended viewing, in French with English subtitles.

2410056,3,B000BB18WC,"I really like the description of main character, Simon, given us by earlier reviewer, Trang T. Nguyen ""Purple Angel,"" who says---""Simon is a sensitive, private, lonely, broken, and tormented soul.""  But I do think when Angel goes on to say:  ""There is no ""obvious"" sexual between him and Mathieu,"" that he is missing one of the major points of this film.  It seems clear to me that it is this very love for Mathieu which is creating havoc with Simon's emotions.  I believe they have had an earlier ""relationship,"" and it was likely a sexual one (note that during Simon's first visit to the lighthouse and conversation with Mathieu, they make reference to it).  However, it soon becomes apparent to us and to Simon that M. is moving on as concerns his relationship preferences (yes, he likely enjoys the wild kiss he initiates with S.---at Louise's urging---but not enough to change his current course).  Louise is now his focus, something that becomes 'majorly' upsetting to S.

If you require further proof of Simon's true feelings, you need only view the late-in-the-film scene in which S. enters Mathieu's quarters (when M. is away), makes his way to the bed, lies in it, eyes closed, holding the bedclothes, then the pillow, to his nose and deeply breathing in Mathieu's scent.  While doing this, he is moved to initiate his own self-gratification.  A tremendously sexy scene---I kept hoping Mathieu would appear in the doorway, but obviously other things were afoot.  (Am not sure what Purple Angel might have thought this scene was all about).

Mother, Marie's, startling disclosure near film's conclusion, concerning one of the major relationships in Simon's life, results in an ending you are unlikely to soon forget.

PS:  Much of this script is a little slow moving and, sometimes, repetitive.  All 3 of my awarded Stars are given, especially for Ulliel's acting as Simon, but also for Garcia's as mother.  I won't be throwing this out of my DVD collection, but likely will not be viewing it often.

2410057,5,B000BB18WC,"When it comes to foreign Movies, it's best to ignore the summery of American studios. They totally disregard the purpose of the movie or the subtle relationships built between characters, but go for the obvious. Simon is a sensitive, private, lonely, broken, and tormented soul. He was drawn to Louise because she came to him willingly and gave him affection. Simon thrives for love and affection because his family deprived him of them. Only his mom loves him despise his efforts of bonding with his dad and sister. There is no ""obvious"" sexual between him and Mathieu. They are just very close friends. Now comes Louise, creating competition between them and sharing their closeness. Now both of them try to impress Louise, and that's why ""things don't feel the same anymore"". You can see the tension between them during their conversation at the pub. Showing two guys kissing don't mean that they were lovers. You can see the confusion on Simon's look when Louise asked them to kiss. They both kissed because they wanted to please Louise!! Eventually, everything drove Simon into desperation. ***SPOILERS***

He's not his dad's child, but of another man's and his mom's. Now he could no longer hope for family love. Louise is his sister and it seems she knows it when she approached him. Feeling rejected and probably sickened that he had sexual thoughts about his sister, also knowing that he now can no longer pursue her, Simon is broken down. Plus, the fact that Mathieu is no longer his very best friend probably destroyed any connection with this world except his mom. So Simon -in a moment of pain- killed himself. But his soul was set free.

He asked for his real dad's room number because he wants to see what his real dad sees when he looks out of the window. Simon is an observer. He likes to look at the scenery through another person's view and see what they thought about, or how they felt when they look at the same thing he does now.

It is a very beautiful film, in which Gaspard Ulliel dazzeled as a brilliant actor. Too bad the other actors don't measure up to him (they are dull in my opinion, they seem to be led by Gaspard, instead of working with him) if not, this movie would be much better!",1150848000,7,2217,4.621827411167513
2410058,4,B000BB18WC,"""The Last Day"" (""Le dernier jour"") shows us a visit by a depressed, eighteen-year old photographer, Simon (played by Gaspard Ulliel) to his family home on the Ile de Re, off the west coast of France.  Taking a train from Paris to La Rochelle, he is approached by a stranger, seventeen-year old Louise (Melanie Laurent), who clings closely enough to win an invitation to join his visit.  Simon's parents and his parents' friends immediately think of Simon and Louise as a couple, possibly even engaged.  Simon, on the other hand, has an old bond with lighthouse keeper Mathieu (Thibault Vincon).  Simon is downcast when Louise resists his pro forma attempts at sex, preferring a romance with Mathieu.  Meanwhile, Simon's mother, Marie (Nicole Garcia), has her own issues when an old flame, Marc (Bruno Todeschini), tries to renew their acquaintance.  There are some twists on the way to an ambiguously down ending.

The acting and photography are fine.  There are good skin shots of Simon and of Louise.  It is helpful to see the film more than once to notice the small points that lead to the conclusions.  The only extras are some trailers.

""The Last Day"" shows how far some people are willing to go to satisfy their curiosity, how far others go to disguise their sexual orientation, and how far others go to have the type of family they want.  Put it all together, and you have a strange but intriguing movie.",1138579200,32,1412,4.765432098765432
2410059,3,B000BB18WC,"This movie is well crafted and the acting is very good. It's slow moving at times but the plight of the main character, his vulnerability and his obviously growing pain, pulled me into the movie so that I felt a strong need to see it through. It becomes increasingly clear that the main character, Simon, is a lonely young man. The movie begins by showing the viewer the end of the movie, without giving away the ending -- very cleverly done. I don't want to give anything away, but one might be tempted to ask ""does this thing still happen in 2005."" I think the answer is a resounding yes, which indicates that GLBT equality has a long way to go.",1135728000,10,647,4.355371900826446
8084237,5,B000BB18WC,"Sad,depressing,but Gaspard Ulliel is eye candy and he is so intense. What I don't understand is why he was abandoned for a guy who is not half as hot as Gaspard! In real life we know this would never happen. I enjoyed the scene of Gaspard enjoying himself very much,but the excitement was destroyed by sadness and shock when he was abandoned and then he killed himself! What horrible people to do what they did to him. I literally cried.",1494028800,,437,4.475

Strange 17 year old girl follows 18 year old boy onto train, she borrows a cigarette, she sneaks into his berth on the train, he takes her home for Christmas to his dysfunctional family? (just like that?) she sleeps in his bed but no sex, she falls in like with his best friend Matthieu. The phone call to Mom. The secret about Simon (the 18 year old, let's keep up) Very predictable, no surprises. Not much dialog. Except for Gaspard, not much in the way of acting, just a lot of looking at each other. DULL. The only surprise was the end which you saw at the start???? HUH! Dumb ending, seriously dumb. No reason for it at all. Ask my why 2 stars??

I really thought Gaspard Ulliel did a fantastic job and he was EASY to look at! I also really enjoyed Nicole Garciale! I do think there should have been a little more sexual tension between the two young men and a bit more of an sexual awakening with Gaspard's character - his sexual identity seemed a bit un-clear.",1271289600,,454,4.617283950617284
8084244,2,B000BB18WC,"Read my review if you want NO SPOILERS!

CINEMATOGRAPHY:
The cinematography was beautiful and rich - everything about it: from the subjects and scenery the artist chose to the actual frame composition, lighting, and effects.

EDITING:
Like many French films, it has disjoint scenes, peculiarly abrupt scene transitions, and even some short scenes that seemed like they were meant to be edited out. French film fans might say, ""That's what makes it a good French film."" I disagree. But in any case, the disjoint scenes don't outweigh the awesome cinematography (as I mentioned before).

ACTING:
The male lead actor was outstanding. The rest of the actors - so-so. (I know many of my fellow reviewers thought the acting was good throughout - I just found most of it to feel forced.)

PLOT/STORY DEVELOPMENT:
Character development was decent for the male lead (and okay for his two friends), but the rest of the characters were flat caricatures - which is probably okay because they were probably intended to be background scenery anyway.
The plot was pretty lame and unbelievable. Yet, despite how unbelievable it was, it was peculiarly and surprisingly predictable. At first thought, I didn't think the predictability was a positive aspect, but in retrospect, I think it speaks well to the director's ability to insert a lot of foreshadowing moments and incidents - many of which are simply awkward silences or unfinished conversations that seem to speak for themselves.

BOTTOM LINE: if you like good cinema-as-art visuals and decent character development, rent this film. If you want fiction-as-entertainment (i.e. a storyline) or a well-edited film, you should pass on this movie.

Despite the outstanding cinematography, I can't give this film a good rating because I don't think story and acting must be sacrificed to showcase an artistic composition.",1248998400,2,1855,5.187290969899665

This movie is all in French their are subtitles in English but if subtitles bother you I would skip this film. The plot is basically a story about growing, up falling in love, and learning about family secrets. The main story line is about the main charter and his love for a girl who doesn't love him back. Their are some clues to the plot that if you don't pay attention to you could miss a lot. I had to watch the movie twice to understand the ending, which is VERY sad. It's an indie film so if that's your thing this is a great film. But it now!",1242000000,,656,4.015267175572519
