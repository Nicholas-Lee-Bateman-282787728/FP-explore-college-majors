3953806,5,B002N1C0YS,"This is a wonderful night of music. It's lovely to hear the pure voices of these superstars on stage, not in a sound studio. It's touching to hear and see Kate McCarrigle, because she was at the end of her life and sang beautifully. What a talent!",1360972800,,247,4.276595744680851
3953807,5,B002N1C0YS,"If you like the McGarrigles, this will demonstrate that their talent isn't limited to the two of them. Martha, Rufus, and Sloan Wainwright (and their substantial number of very talented friends) help to blow the roof off the Knitting Factory. I'm not sure I've witnessed so much talent on one stage. A truly impressive and fun performance.",1292284800,8,339,4.964912280701754

Some of the guest spots will take you by surprise a little!  But you'll feel like you're part of the McGarrigle/Wainwright family, and really, how could you not love that?

8374543,3,B002N1C0YS,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas to see Kate, Anna and EmmyLou.  Some of the performances were quite good, others a little strange.  I wish I could find the full cast somewhere to know who all of the players were besides the ones that were specifically named.....the blond in the orangish blouse seemed to be prominent, but who is she?",1420243200,,345,4.548387096774194
