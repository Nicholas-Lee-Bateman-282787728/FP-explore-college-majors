7910029,4,B00000IBZK,"Decent home-video digital camcorder quality. Surprisingly unobtrusive narration, with some good facts, though poor vocal quality and many simple-minded ruminations. Views of modern convenience items in this Amish subculture (plastic cafeteria trays, utensils; black plastic trash bags; port-a-potty; powder-coated sheetmetal barn-cladding; skid-steer bobcat and backhoe; ugly midwestern split-level ranch residence) and use of cinderblock foundation and other manufactured building materials to surround the timberframe. Team effortlessness in coordinating 50-100 men in this barn-raising. Clamoring and inexpert handling of large items, sledges, etc seem to work out in the end. A fine document on the whole.",1291593600,,709,6.473684210526316
7910030,3,B00000IBZK,"This video was a disappointment, because someone just set up a camera and let it run. They did not even have a good spot for viewing! A barn raising is a wonderful community enterprise, and deserves careful documentation. I  do hope that someone will be inspired by this video to make a much better  one, showing all the steps, complete with closeups, and not waste our time  watching time go by.",946252800,,396,4.549295774647887
