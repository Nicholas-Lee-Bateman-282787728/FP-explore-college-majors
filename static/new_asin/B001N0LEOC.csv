8322744,5,B001N0LEOC,"So surprised that every reviewer didn't love this.  It's not intended to be an all-inclusive look at sex trafficking-- but it's a great short (~22 min) personal story, of Carissa, who looks like the girl-next-door, and her journey as a teenager to survey, by working as a prostitute.  It is a powerful and insightful story about how girls end up working in the sex trade, and how Carissa escaped, and is now working as an advocate for this population.",1437523200,,451,4.69620253164557
8322745,3,B001N0LEOC,"I bought this DVD after reading the book and adopting it for a course on women and crime.  However, it is only minimally enriching.  There was so much room to comment on so much more. Missed opportunity.",1377302400,,203,4.45945945945946
8322746,5,B001N0LEOC,"Very Real... Such a moving documentary, especially after reading Carissa's Book - Runaway Girl. The film was short but to the point.  Highly Recommend both the movie and the book.",1357084800,2,179,4.966666666666667
8322747,5,B001N0LEOC,"I work at a juvenile detention facility.  This is a short film, about twenty minutes, which tells this young woman's story about her conscription into forced prostitution.
Every adult and teen needs to understand that most prostitutes aren't just sluts who like the work.  Many are good girls who get entrapped at a very young age, and who are beaten and kept hungry until they are disposed of, often to provide an example for other working children.
This woman describes her journey in a film short enough to hold the attention of at-risk girls like she once was.  We've shown it many times in our institution, in part, because the girl ends up graduating from college, in spite of her trials.  Carissa is a winner!",1281916800,6,716,4.704
