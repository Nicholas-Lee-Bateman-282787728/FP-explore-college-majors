8128334,4,B000G0O5DM,I used to see these cartoons around 1957 at starlite drive in between movies and almost remember well. It's great to see again although this dvd is for my three grand daughters. I hope they remember some day as I did about these cartoons.,1454025600,,238,4.431818181818182

8128338,5,B000G0O5DM,"We had another copy of some episodes of the Gerald McBoing Boing, so I was happy to find another set of them. This is a delightful cartoon for children of all ages.

8128339,5,B000G0O5DM,"I remember this from my childhood in the 50's, although some episodes have been updated.  Great mid-century animation and the funny premise of a boy who can't say words, just sounds.  My grand daughter was mesmerized.",1376265600,,217,5.0
8128340,5,B000G0O5DM,Back to the basic of good cartoons with no violence. I bought this because it was one of Dr. Seuss's old books made into a movie.,1369785600,,129,4.0
