8118356,3,B000F6ZCVQ,"...but this documentary of famed 1950's transsexual, Christine Jorgensen, was so sugar-coated that it was a bit dull. It probably would have been better if made by E! Entertainment, as an E! True Hollywood Story.

Although, what I found interesting, and wish they would have touched more on, was when were Christine's young nieces and cousins (who were interviewed here, as adults) told about her transsexuality. They all referred to her as ""Auntie Chris,"" but they never said at what point were they told she was, in reality, their uncle. They acted as if they always knew, but surely there must have been at a certain age they were told.

It was rather sad at the end that she appeared to have died practically penniless in a V.A. mission hospital. This too was simply glossed over, as other details of her life. Due to these things I give this bio an average C rating!",1315267200,2,871,4.64935064935065
8118357,5,B000F6ZCVQ,Just Great Documentary but too short for the prize they were selling it for.  I think it would have been great if it was longer.,1307836800,2,128,4.12
8118358,5,B000F6ZCVQ,"Christine Jorgensen was one of the most fascinating people of the past century.  News of her sexual transformation from shy and awkward boy to bold and beautiful woman knocked news of the hydrogen bomb testing from the front pages of newspapers and propelled Jorgensen to instant celebrity. She was the most reported person in the press in 1953 yet her story has been erased from many history books in a way common to LGBT lives of the past.

A&E's Biography treats Jorgensen's life with respect, focusing on her childhood and family life. Friends and family members interviewed here express their feelings for Christine, showing how the love from family and friends eases the difficulties individuals with issues of sex and gender often face.

There has been speculation in recent years that Jorgensen herself leaked news of her transformation to the press. This presentation of her life does not address that, keeping with previous accounts which has an acquaintance of her father selling the story. Either way she forged a path few had travelled and remarkably landed on her feet.

Once Jorgensen became a public figure she was a barometer for other people's feelings, stirring revulsion in some and admiration in others. Despite the extreme reaction to her, Jorgensen was a poised and eloquent defender of sexual freedom during an era of rigid gender roles and severe repression of homosexuality.

Included here are some excellent film clips and photos, though one gets the impression there was a great deal more in archives than could fit this alloted forty-four minute time frame. I give A&E full marks for treating Jorgensen's story respectfully and hope this will pave the way for more biographies of noted lesbian, gay and trans people.

For those wishing to learn more about Christine Jorgensen I recommend Susan Stryker's introduction to the reprint of Jorgensen's biography, and Joanne Meyerowitz's, ""How Sex Changed: A History of Transsexuality in the United States."" To hear just how charming and well-mannered Jorgensen was a 1959 LP recorded interview ""Christine Reveals"" has been recently released on CD. These items are available through Amazon.",1160352000,9,2163,5.1833810888252145
