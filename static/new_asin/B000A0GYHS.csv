Beautifully shot, excellent sound design and amazing footage of living fossils lend visibility to the process of one creature differentiating into another. Evolution becomes truly visible and unfolds right before you.",1238716800,,265,5.82051282051282
8071431,2,B000A0GYHS,"DVD starts out showing Hubble space photograph shots--as in HOW our universe starts, then shots of the lifeless earth from space and on the ground in it's 1] volcanic stage, then 2] it's cooling stage, 3] it's rain/water accumulation stages, 4] and FINALLY to the primative oceans and it's microscopic first life forms and how they developed into more complex forms through to sea life as we know it today.

There should MUCH MORE narration than there is with lots of back-to-back scenes presented with NO EXPLANATION of what you're looking at, and when there IS narration, it's deadly dull, ho-hum, time-to-sleep stuff.

Spend your $ on ""Ocean Oasis"" about lower Baha California (5-Stars)--beautifully filmed and narrated, and/or ""Atlantis"" (4-Stars), the latter opening with a brief mood-setting narration in French (set the DVD for ""subtitles"" first) and then proceeds to undersea ""scenarios"" with no narration at all--just screen overlays that translate to ""first day"", ""the night"", ""dangerous"" (a shark gathering that escalates into a feeding frenzy), ""grace"" and the like.",1166918400,6,1078,5.3352941176470585
