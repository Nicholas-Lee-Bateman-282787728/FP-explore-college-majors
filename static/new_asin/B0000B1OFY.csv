I have compassion for his situation but feel it clouds the real story about Mt. Kilimanjaro",1437523200,,192,4.848484848484849

7998022,4,B0000B1OFY,"In 99...I climbed the small beast.  The doc. is pretty good--if I had not actually endeavoured in climbing Kili...I would give this 5 stars.  But-I am jadded...as once you have been there...nothing can truly reflect the awesome magnitude of the mountain.  But for those who cannot get there, this may be the next best thing---",1234137600,4,326,4.890909090909091
7998023,4,B0000B1OFY,"Though we enjoyed the IMAX Kilimanjaro film, it fairly well glossed over the difficulties of climbing the mountain, and pretty much ignored the porters who labor climbers up the mountain.  This Nova special is a bit more realistic, and brought back memories of my Kili climb two years ago.  The scripting is a bit hokey, and they use the term ""high altitude mountaineering"" with annoying regularity... ""high altitude trekking"" would be more accurate.  At any rate, it's an interesting film, and discusses the problems on the mountain associated with global warming and climate change. The quality isn't IMAX, but it's still pretty good, and worth having a look.",1168300800,14,661,5.101851851851852
