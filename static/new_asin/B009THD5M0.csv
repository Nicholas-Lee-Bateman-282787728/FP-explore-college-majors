5553158,4,B009THD5M0,"A good thriller! I really enjoyed this film, it made me not want to trust anyone ever again..CREEPY!!! I don't want to give anything away, but it will make you scared to be in a relationship! Although a little slow to start, the characters were intriguing and the twists in the plot kept me entertained...I liked that the film was shot in almost the same location the whole time, interesting idea. I also really love the look of this movie poster. For a quick and fun thriller, its worth the $3.99 to rent!",1340582400,,506,4.451612903225806
5553159,1,B009THD5M0,"Not sure what movie the other two reviewers before me saw, but they must have been in on the production. I cannot imagine anyone truly found this movie above a ""B"" level... and where was the ""twist?"" In fact, the ending was a complete ""WTF???"" - I, personally, wouldn't call that a ""twist."" There were so many stupid unanswered questions (that did not seem intentional) the whole movie just left me feeling unanswered, unsatisfied and like it was completely rushed - like the writers got so burned out toward the end they just said, ""let's just get this over with."" A psychological thriller?? More like a psychological-thriller-wannabe... Extremely disappointing considering I was relying on the others' reviews... so if you are like me and rent based on reviews, then trust me when I tell you not to waste your time on this lame flick.",1340496000,5,836,4.8125
5553160,5,B009THD5M0,Extremely great film! I was blown away at how the ending came out. Kept me on my toes for sure!,1340496000,,95,3.8
8561487,1,B009THD5M0,Very annoying and confusing waste of time. The viewer is never given any understanding of what is going on and the weird details are never explained.,1390867200,,149,4.769230769230769
8561488,2,B009THD5M0,I didn't realize what happened at the end.  Was that murdering? That was so confusing. Some one please tell me were Laura and Caroline just one person?  Was so weird!,1384819200,,166,4.5
8561489,1,B009THD5M0,"The only reason I am writing this review is because it's the only way I could rate it. I watched this on HuluPlus, and while this was an interesting idea in theory, the execution fell flat. Sorry friends of the film (film-maker), but this is not a five-star flick.",1375315200,3,264,4.408163265306122
8561490,1,B009THD5M0,"I watched this film free on Hulu and it was horrendous.  I mean, if you only have two (three?) characters in the entire movie they've got to be interesting and well developed.  Bad plot, awkward dialogue, horrible ending.  Henry was just creepy and not in a good, suspenseful way.  A guy that creepy (he never leaves his apartment, he has no friends, he wears black tank tops and black socks...) would never be in a relationship with a normal girl like Carolyn/Laura.  His character was not developed in a way that was believable. The characters and their interactions with each other were disjointed.  Cinematography was awful.  The only reason I kept watching it was to find out if Carolyn/Laura was the same person.  ""Laura"" was the only thing in the movie that didn't make me want to fall asleep.

**SPOILER***
You could see Laura's diaphragm moving in the scene where she was supposed to be dead on the floor.  Also, it is not a shocking twist ending that Carolyn says ""Who's Tony?"" in the last scene.  I guess that is supposed to tie up the loose ends to prove that Henry was clearly crazy but it was poorly executed and the movie had already deflated by that point.

The premise for the movie is clever. It could have been so much better but it was not.  I had to rate this movie because the amount of stars given on Amazon is misleading.",1371168000,3,1345,4.508264462809917
8561491,5,B009THD5M0,"I rented this movie online from Amazon and was not just pleased by it, but impressed by the acting ability of Andrew Perez and Erica Rankin. This was a great psychotic thriller and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie!",1344816000,,236,4.386363636363637
8561492,1,B009THD5M0,"If you enjoy the scenery, scene after scene, after scene, after scene, after scene which never ever changes but you would expect - least of all dialogue changes! Only in your dreams whomever gave the ratings before me, must have been part of the cast or gofers, photographers,writers,directer, or producers. This MOVIE REALLY IS HORRIBLE and I would honestly pay someone to watch this movie in its entirety, BAD, BAD, BAD and terribly an insult to anyone who would watch it without stopping and the continuing.",1344729600,5,510,4.941860465116279
8561493,5,B009THD5M0,"Very suspenseful film about relationships and the psychos that have them. What starts out as a sweet love story quickly turns into a weird, twisting, tale of suspicion, confusion, and well you'll have to see it for yourself to find out. The actors do a wonderful job of bringing the story to life. The director/writer of the film has a great talent and should be watched for any future projects he works on.",1343779200,,407,4.589041095890411
8561494,1,B009THD5M0,"This movie was AWFUL! The acting was just terrible and the plot was worse. It was actually painful to watch. I had to skip around just to find a part that was remotely watchable. Clearly, production wrote the other reviews. Don't be fooled.

The worst part is I PAID for this. I could have gotten something awesome, like ice cream with that $3.99.

Do yourself a favor and avoid.",1343001600,6,379,4.478260869565218
8561495,5,B009THD5M0,"I wasn't prepared for the level of shock and discomfort this movie delivered, and for that reason I recommend everyone go see it. The acting was great and I'm curious to see where Andrew and Erika pop up next.",1341273600,3,209,4.384615384615385
8561496,5,B009THD5M0,"While we may not live in Hitchcock's Era, Jon Lefkovitz's Engagement comes as close as they come to recreating the famed director's propensities for thrill, suspense, ingenious filmmaking, inspired casting, and the ability to take risks not often seen in a homogenized Hollywood. To say that Engagement doesn't disappoint would be an understatement, because the film does more than tap millennial zeitgeists and post 9/11 ambivalences. When a feature combines satire, mystery, and romance it provides multiple reasons to go see it, Engagement gives these and much more--take a look at this film and its rising director, cast, and crew, you won't regret it!",1341187200,2,656,5.3173076923076925
