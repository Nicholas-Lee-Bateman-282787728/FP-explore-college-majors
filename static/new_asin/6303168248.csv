585502,5,6303168248,If you are a big fan of Joan Collins then you must add this one to your collection. This made-for-television miniseries from 1986 features Joan Collins when she was at her best. Unfortunately they do not make television series like this any more.,1310860800,2,246,4.744186046511628
585503,5,6303168248,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT AIRED IN ""1986"". IMMEDIATELY AFTER I SAW THE FIRST PART, I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT THE BOOK. I'D TRIED TO CATCH THE MOVIE EVERY TIME IT AIRED AFTERWARDS, ON AVERAGE ABOUT ONCE A YEAR, UNTIL IT WAS FINALLY RELEASED ON VHS. I LOVED HOW HELENE JUNOT ""JOAN COLLINS"" ROSE ABOVE ADVERSITY TO BECOME A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WOMAN. I COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF WATCHING THAT MOVIE. THEN DVD'S CAME INTO PLAY. BY THAT TIME MY COPY OF SINS HAD SINCE WORN OUT FROM CONSTANT PLAY. IN VAIN I LOOKED FOR IT. NOW I'LL BE GETTING MY COPY AS SOON AS IT IS RELEASED. THIS A WONDERFUL MOVIE. DEFINITELY A MUST SEE.",1308096000,7,615,4.264957264957265
585504,5,6303168248,"This is what 80's mini series were all about.  Big budget, great locations and glamor.  Joan Collins knew how to give it all.  Without repeating the previous review - which I agree with EVERYTHING, they left out the fantastic 80's actress who played the Joan role in the 1st part of the mini series.  Catherine Mary Stewart who was in such cult classics as The Last Starfighter and Night of the Comet.  Think it's easy playing Joan Collins?  Catherine was up for it and gave a dead on seamless performance.  Can't wait to own this.",1304553600,2,531,4.526315789473684
585505,5,6303168248,"By the time ""Sins"" aired as a made-for-television miniseries in 1986 on CBS Joan Collins was at the top of her craft. She was the highest-paid actress on network television (a distinction she deserved for her soaring portrayal as Alexis on ""Dynasty"") and she was in demand for other TV roles. The first major production she worked on was this well-received miniseries, airing in February, 1986. Not only was Joan starring in ""Sins"", but she was the executive producer who worked alongside her then husband, Peter Holm, now known as ""The Swede"".

 The miniseries is full of glamour, opulence, and elegence, all elements of a good Joan Collins movie. ""Sins"" deals with a character named Helene (Collin's role) who endured a turbulent childhood, witnessing her mother's rape and losing her brother and sister to the Nazis. Eventually, Helene makes a life for herself in the fashion world as others try to destroy her. Helene is also determined to track down those her caused her family harm and to become reaquainted with her siblings.

 This marks the first time ""Sins"" has received a DVD release here in North America, although it was (like ""Monte Carlo"") released in Europe on DVD via Region 2.

 The movie was shot in New York City and Paris and its obvious from the production values that money was no option. The supporting cast is excellent headed by Lauren Hutton, sexy Timothy Dalton, Gene Kelly, and James Farentino (Joan's co-star in her first season of ""Dynasty"").

 CBS' main competitor, NBC, wanted to sink ""Sins"" on its original airing. On the first night the peacock network aired the then #1 rated series on American television, ""The Cosby Show"" against it as well as airing their epic minieseries ""Peter The Great"" with an all-star cast. Joan and ""Sins"" creamed the competition proving someone with the acting chops and class that Joan had could never be beaten.

 ""Sins"" was followed later that year by the least successful ""Monte Carlo"" also starring Joan.",1302220800,9,1973,4.9156626506024095

In reading the reviews ahead of me, I'm not sure where these people are coming from.  I am a big Timothy Dalton fan and have seen almost everything he has been in.  His performance is always great no matter what he is in, but I have to say that some of the casting for this show was not good at all.  Joan Collins, who played Helene, was too old for the part, actually so was Tim.  Joan at times is supposed to be in her 20's, 30's and 40's and she is 53 during the entire movie.  People did not age.  Neil Dickson who played Hubert and William Young who played Jacques looked the same age throughout the entire movie.  Tim who played Edmond, Helene's brother, was about 12 years old in the beginning, was supposed to have been taken by the German Nazi's for 5 years to a work camp and then it was another 9 years before Helene found him - that would make him in his late 20's - Tim was 41 at the time. It was just laughable to have Joan at 53, being married to Gene Kelly who was 74, saying I want a baby.  Putting big stars in a movie, doesn't always make the movie.  It had a good plot, but this kind of sloppiness in a movie ruined it for me.  Although, some actors did a great job (Timothy Dalton, Steven Berkoff, James Farentino, Giancarlo Giannini (loved him in Daniel Craig's Bond), Marisa Berenson, etc.., overall I found the movie very irritating and not very enjoyable.",1297728000,,1407,4.291666666666667
585507,5,6303168248,"I taped this mini-series back in the 80's when it originally aired on television and my mom and I have watched it so many times that we could recite the dialogue!!  It is wonderful!! It is Joan Collins at her best, plus it includes an all-star ensemble cast.  Timothy Dalton, James Farentino, Gene Kelly, Lauren Hutton all co-star in this awesome mini-series.  Watch it and I guarantee you will find something to like about!",1158278400,18,424,4.702702702702703

585509,5,6303168248,"This long forgotten Gem, made in the 1980's, is one of the best films starring Diva Joan Collins. Many viewers might find it rather dated, filled with cliches and Dynasty-like dialogue but it's quite interesting and infectious from start to end.
The characters are two dimensional & the plot goes on like a soap-opera. Yes, the film goes on forever... but it was originally shown on TV as a mini-series...

585624,5,6303168248,"This is a great story.
Yeah ok its an over long soap but hey you got sexy imp Joan, for the ladies you got Tim Dalton,  James Farentino, and Neil Dickson,
You got Former Bond/Beverly Hills Cop/Rambo baddie  Steven Berkoff. hamming it up more then ever.
Twice 007 Tim Dalton's performance will grab your heart it made me & the wife big fans of his.
The story of a fashion magazine head (Joan) told in flash back and forth.
Her child hood (played by 20 something Catherine Mary Stewart) hunted by Nazi Berkoff, mind you 52 yr old Joan takes over in part 2 and we must understand she's only 25-30, oook.
This has action, S E X, revenge, humor did I forget to say S E X? They paid some big bucks on this one, watch for the golden ball, W O W!
Sadly this was the last thing Gene Kelly did as Joan's much older husband,  his role is heartfelt .
There are just too many fine actors to list here:
Joseph Bologna, classy Capucine, cure and sexy imp Judi Bowker as Tim's daughter who's mother dies in childbirth.
Allen Garfield bad as ever.
Revenge seeking Giancarlo Giannini, Lauren Hutton, Neil Dickson, & Berkoff. who are all after Joan.
You'll spend time in Paris, Greece, New York City, Vienna, Venice, Virgina and others
Bottom line watch and enjoy.
P.S. Great role for William Allen Young as Joan's gay photographer friend. One would think his guy from A SOLDER'S STORY stayed in Paris after WW II. Trust me have I ever lied to you?
So go order SINS!",1417305600,6,1447,4.371747211895911
