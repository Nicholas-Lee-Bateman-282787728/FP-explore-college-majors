189273,4,1572521368,"I knew this Billy Crudop after having seen him in Charlotte Grey. It's remarkable in Julian's role. After that I found his

other recent films such as Grind etc. He is perfect and has much talent,with his expressions alternately menacing and innocent. He is a good actor in this period.  Grind is not a high budget film but has power in it. About two hours of a deeply affecting drama between two brothers on the screen, I was not disappointed at all. Hope this Billy Crudop would be still requested in Hollywood and let see him in the next film.",1143072000,2,546,4.45
189274,5,1572521368,"Billy Crudup hit the floor running in ""Grind"" (1997), his first feature film, in a tale
of a loser who is mesmirized by danger and easily slips into tense, gut-wrenching situations. We see an incredible range of reactions & emotions in the character of Eddie, and a hint of Billy's versitility as an actor.

  Crudup is best known for his role as the laid-back rock star in ""Almost Famous""(2000).  I was recently blown away by his performance as Ned Kynaston, the English Restoration ""actress"" par-excellance,' in ""Stage Beauty"" (2004).

  Adrienne Shelly was quite captivating as Eddie's ""Forbidden Love"" interest, and Amanda Peet graces the screen in an early appearance, as Eddie's ex-girlfriend.

  The dramatic tension and timing is first-rate in ""Grind"".  This deftly crafted film was the first effort of the husband/wife team of Director Chris Kent and Screenwriter-Producer Laura Lau, who also gave us another edgy and facinating tale in ""Open Water"" (2003) .

  The use of real locations set in Northern N.J., notably in and around the Clifton area, predated the setting later made familiar to us in ""The Sopranos"".  In fact, Soprano affectionados will enjoy seeing the appearance of Frank Vincent, as Eddie's father Nick, in ""Grind"". Frank is still fresh on our minds as Phil Leotardo, who was seen prominently throughout the entire Season 5 of the Sopranos!

  I give ""Grind"" my own humble gesture of ""a solid Upward Fist""!",1126569600,3,1434,5.055555555555555
189275,4,1572521368,"It's too bad that certain plots automatically label the films that use them ""soap opera"".  If a man has an affair with his brother's wife, bingo--it's not a drama, it's a soap opera.  That's what happens in this film, but does that automatically make it a bad film?

Of course not.

It's not only the excellent acting that makes this a strong film; it's also the sharp, intelligent writing.  Without good writing, any play or film can easily and quickly lapse into the type of work that can justifiably give it a ""soap"" label; here, the term ""soap"" is pejorative, meaning not so much the type of plot, but the quality of the work itself.

Co-writers Laura Lau and Chris Kentis (the latter also directed) have a perfect ear for the dialogue that characters like this would speak; they're working class New Jerseyites whose suburban homes are their pride and joy.  What this really means is that the writers know how their characters respond to events and each other in the way they talk and behave.  Without this sensitivity/attunement to the real emotional tenor of its characters, a script will be hogwash that leaves the audience totally unsatisfied.

That's not the case here.  Eddie, played by Billy Crudup, tries to move his life forward after a mishap lands him in jail and he's released.  He comes to stay with his brother Terry and Terry's wife Janey (Adrienne Shelly) and before long, Eddie and Janey are involved--because Terry's a hardass who needs to prove he can do what he has to do, even if it means getting into illegal stuff.  This involvement is his focus; his wife and baby are secondary.

Eddie gets a job at the same factory where his brother and father work, but he's not happy; he needs more in his life.  You can feel his restlessness, feel how he thinks having it on with Janey will quell that, then feel how, guess what, it doesn't.  He's an intense guy, Eddie, and if he really knew exactly how to get what he wanted--in fact, if he really knew WHAT he wanted--the things that happen here wouldn't have happened.

Does this have a soap opera plot?  If we want to use stereotypical American cliched labels, then, yeah, I guess it does.  But so what?  This is a solid drama and is definitely worth seeing, if not owning.

Highly recommended.",1096761600,5,2266,4.6175
189276,3,1572521368,"The movie's more like 2 and a half but I gave it the benefit of being rounded up.  The movie is about a drifter who has an affair with his brother's neglected wife.  The plot's been done before but the performances here are great and are what make the movie.  Until this movie I had seen two Adrienne Shelly movies, Trust and The Unbelievable Truth.  I could tell Adrienne had something but suffered under Hal Hartley's stagey direction.  In Grind, she was finally allowed to become the character and show what an actress she could be.  Billy Crudup and the the guy who plays Terry as well.  They become the characters and I also like fact that the people in this movie are believable, realistic.
Shelly is still in her late thirties and I hope that Hollywood gives her ""the role"".",1033689600,4,781,4.49645390070922
189277,3,1572521368,"Billy Crudup plays a screw-up who comes back to town and wreaks havoc in the lives of his brother and his sister-in-law. Adrienne Shelly plays the wife, and there is real chemistry between Crudup and Shelly, and the resolution of the conflict between the brothers is very believable. The movie is very quiet and it has a way of speaking volumes without having much said on the screen. This is a low-budget film that relies on characters to drive the story instead of quirky personality traits. You won't be disappointed if you like character-driven drama. The only quibble is why the handsome Billy Crudup insists on playing roles where he is perpetually unkempt.",972950400,,663,4.876106194690266
189278,4,1572521368,"GRIND is a small, oddly affecting indie film which escapes its soap opera  plotting and ends up an overlooked gem.  The story concerns two brothers,  the older a stable, married father-to-be, the other a n'er do well just  released from prison.  Though lovingly taken into the older brother's home,  the 'bad' brother just can't seem to escape trouble with desperate  characters, not to mention his passionate affair with the brother's  confused wife.  The movie takes some harrowing turns and is very tasteful  with the sexual interludes, allowing some fine character development and a  surprising and satisfying conclusion.  Indie film vet Adrienne Shelley adds  another fine performance to her growing resume of odd films, but the real  star is the New York stage actor Billy Crudup (later to be seen in  INVENTING THE ABBOTTS and SLEEPERS).  With his expressions alternately  menacing and innocent and a keen sense of his own power over the camera,  this young actor is ready to take off into the stratosphere, not as a  patented pretty boy, but as a deeply affecting dramatic talent.  GRIND is a  fine welcome for him, and for us--keep watching.  END",903830400,29,1155,5.0

7797644,3,1572521368,"Grind (1997) is a movie that is greatly underestimated, perhaps for
the lack of big name actors and crew, except for perhaps Frank
Vincent.

In reality, this work is powerful, and at least over 90 mins,
relatively fascinating, from a story rooted in a realism that
cannot be denied (anyone reading the tabloids), coupled with an
undeniable charisma of the actors and actresses, their simplicity,
bursting youth and natural presence on screen.

The topic has already been covered, in MONUMENT AVE (aka SNITCH
1998), in terms of a ""chop shop"" .. meaning, in the downturn of the
economy, a divorce, hardship, some individuals may turn to
insurance fraud to reap financial gains, as automobiles are resold
for their value in parts.

Frank Vincent does a fine job, as the father of 2 grown men, one of
which is like the turtle who finishes first, steady but slowly from
his 9 to 5 job down at a metal finishing plant, while the other son
is the proverbial hare, winning car races, but distracted in terms
of his own life objectives, and unaware of his social surroundings
and repercussions of a clumsy conduct.

Adrienne Shelly is a remarkable actress, with a low-key presence,
yet subtle, with a convincing human presence, passionate and
interesting to watch.

Paul Schulze, as the husband, is equally interesting, as the story
intertwines that of 2 brothers, and how the two deal with disparate
circumstances, their own differences and talents but loyal to one
another as brothers.

Saul Stein is credible as a tough businessman in the underworld,
who dabbles in the money gain game, but who s not prepared to lower
himself to having blood on his hands.

Those viewers having a mundane or monotonous life, after viewing
this film, will be relieved in not having to deal with the
surprises that are shown here ...unfaithful wives, the underworld,
sexual jealousy, beatings, threats with weapons, heavy financial
losses from gambling on car drag races, time in a penitentiary,
automobile theft.

From a cinematic point of view, the scenes are crystal clear, as is
the audio and the  realism of the story and action, although not
rising to a wide-screen caliber. It also and lacks subtitles. The
music is fine, and well chosen.

Examples of life events that may ""connect"" with the audience are
backyard BBQ's, the arrival of a baby, the boredom of work, and its
politics, celebration of birthdays,  parties, great looking women.

The movie  suggests that one's character is evaluated in how one
deals with a passion, in this case car racing,  that one doesn't
want to give up, yet not sufficiently financially viable or
sustainable as a livelihood.

How readily does an individually give in to the temptation,
crossing the line,  into into the underworld, or to sexual passion,
of gambling, to the tedious 9 to 5 routine, in sum, of ""the grind.""",1236988800,,2839,4.895615866388309
