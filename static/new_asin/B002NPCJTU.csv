8425099,4,B002NPCJTU,"This is a well made and a very entertaining movie; Reg Park is excellent as Hercules, and not that bad as an actor.  Christopher Lee is excellent as usual.  The picture quality is very good and the colors are crisp.  Not bad for a low-budget movie made in 1961.  Unfortunately, I already purchased the same movie, but under the English title ""Hercules In the Haunted World"" so if you have that one, do not bother buying this one; they are the same.  I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy this type of movies.",1393113600,,519,4.421052631578948
