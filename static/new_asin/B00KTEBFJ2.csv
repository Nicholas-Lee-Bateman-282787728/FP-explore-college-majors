6445888,5,B00KTEBFJ2,"I'm so glad that Good Luck Charlie is releasing another DVD. I have loved watching this show. The DVD will have the series finale episode ""Good Bye Charlie on it. I am hoping the DVD has the Jessie cross over episode on it. This is a great DVD to get for any Good Luck Charlie fan.

This makes 3 Good Luck Charlie DVDs available, you have Good Luck Charlie: Enjoy The Ride, Good Luck Charlie: So Long, Farewell, and Good Luck Charlie It's Christmas.",1405555200,6,449,4.345238095238095
