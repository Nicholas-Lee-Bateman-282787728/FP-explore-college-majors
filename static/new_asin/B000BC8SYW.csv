2412811,3,B000BC8SYW,"This is a classic inside look to the ""stereotypical"" view of a selection of die hard Chelsea fans, who go around battering the living daylights out of anyone in their way, whether it is their best friend or enemy. In reality however, this is a dying breed, with the average Chelsea fan now watching the games from his Front Living room on Sky,  whilst eating dinner with his wife in the front room.

It is filmed in a very real and cold fashion, with a similar raw feel to Lock Stock and Snatch. Although the language is exceptionally harsh, it is very amusing with some classic lines that you can easily find yourself repeating long after the film has finished.",1154649600,,662,4.508333333333334
2412812,5,B000BC8SYW,Nice movie. Don't watch it at night since you'll won't be able to sleep. You'll be too pumped up. Nice study and unapologetic. Fun movie and moving.,1152144000,2,148,4.518518518518518
2412813,5,B000BC8SYW,I liked this movie - it left an impression. It is a refreshing punch in the face to liberal pro-multi-cultural types - that have had it coming for a long time.,1149206400,3,159,4.161290322580645
2412814,3,B000BC8SYW,Overall not a bad movie. It was entertaining enough but there are some details that I didn't care for in this movie. The first are the fight scenes. The scenes involving fights seem too choreographed and formula based. Also the heavy British accents were sometimes nearly impossible to understand thus using the rewind on my control to decipher the dialogue was necessary. To make matters worse they spoke rather fast and incoporated a lot of slang that most Americans would have no clue what it means. Not bad though. I recommend this flick.,1137283200,,542,4.838709677419355
2412815,5,B000BC8SYW,"As I travelled across London in the ""tube"" one Saturday in the early 70's, the train stopped at a station In East Ham. To the bemusement of the existing passengers the people who boarded the cars were ""fans"" of the London Football team West Ham United. Characteristically these fans wore the affected uniform of the day, skinhead haircuts, rolled up jeans held up by braces, or as you would understand the term, suspenders, black crombie overcoats and the ubiquitous white t-shirt. They were off to watch their team play at home and euphemistically, for a bit of bovver, the nickname of their boots, Doctor Martens. They were loud and loutish on the train jeering and picking on anyone who was not white and we all breathed a collective sigh of relief when they disembarked.

Jump forward thirty years or so and some things have changed while others have not. Football grounds have demolished the terraces and the white working class males have been usurped by the middle classes who are the only ones who can afford the seats. The manic fans have changed too. Whereas once they were mindless gangs bored out of their minds and easy prey for neo-Nazi groups, the serious troublemakers have organised the firms which charaterize some of soccer's premier league fans and who are identified by British police and deterred from following Engk=land overseas.

Whereas the story of the seventies was told in short novels with the imaginative titles of 'Skinhead' followed later by 'Suedehead' and other similar titles, today we have the Football Factory.

This is a tense, gripping story which induces a feeling of fear for the less worldly viewer. It has an all too real sense of reality about it as anyone with experience with living in a major British city will tell you. Not for the first time has a British movie shocked the viewer with such language and mindless brutality. Not for the first time has a British movie exposed the alienation of disaffected British youth, although those movies were more common in Mrs. Thatcher's day than under the Blair regime. Indeed this movie is an attack on the politics of Blair although the overt references here are subdued in volume. The tensions between the old and new generations are highlighted by the superb performance of Dudley Sutton although this was spoilt at the end when the central character awakes in a hospital bed after a major beating to find himself next to Sutton whp plays his grandfather. Given the distance between the two incidents which led them to being in the hospital in the first place it is extremely unlikely that they would have even been in the same hospital never mind the same ward.

This does not detract from the movie which feels almost like a documentary never mind a drama. The plot is rather thin given the subject matter but the result is a microcosm of the life of members of one of these firms and it is clear from my own experience that the researchers have done a very thorough job.

As a movie this is an excellent piece of work although I suspect that the civil authorities in the US will have serious reservations about it's screening and general release on DVD.

Rather as entertainment, people should understand the seriousness of the subject matter being shown on their screens. There are many lessons to be drawn on both sides of the Atlantic about the way in which our societies are developing in the light of the existance of organisations such as these. But on a cautionary note, the firms of the movie are not as widespread and football matches are not dangerous to visit, in general but the casual visitor might want to do some homework before they go to one.

Five stars.",1135123200,27,3670,4.74294670846395
2412816,4,B000BC8SYW,"I bought this DVD a year ago back in England. I cant wait to show it to my Septic mates when it comes out over here in the US. They all love the Lock Stock, Snatch stuff so they,ll love this movie. Jog on you sighs.",1131321600,4,215,3.6956521739130435
2412817,5,B000BC8SYW,"A guy I work with brought me a copy of the UK version of this DVD and being a soccer fan I gave it a watch.  Damn!  What a great time.  I had just finished reading ""Among the Thugs"" which is a brilliant book about Football (what we call soccer) Hooligans and then this movie comes along.  It is NOT a documentary so there is a story to follow and characters to like and hate.  It has some great fights ala Fight Club and the comedy is british and dark, kinda like Snatch or Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels.  I have not stopped talking about the movie since I watched it.  It comes out the day after Christmas which is lucky for friends and family or they would all be getting this under the tree!  Sit back, relax, enjoy, and thank god this doesn't happen at NFL games!",1130716800,6,771,4.12751677852349

2412878,5,B000BC8SYW,"I thought the movie was really good and the dialogue is pretty good as far as British flicks go, I liked it a lot but I think the movie ""Green Street Hooligans"" is actually a better movie, but don't get me wrong a different storyline is always good and this movie has quite a bit of fighting in it, but you'll have to judge everything for yourself.",1294185600,,348,4.208955223880597
2412879,4,B000BC8SYW,"This is a wild film. The whole concept of going to a sports event where the only intention is to kick butt on the opposing team's fans escapes me, but it seems to be the order of the day in England. This film involves a group of guys that are in a ""firm"" (read: illegal consortium) who do little more than drink, take drugs and fight. The story centers around one of the gang, Tommy Johnson, who is having bad dreams which he thinks might be telling him he's heading down the wrong path.

Johnson is played well by Danny Dyer who I've seen in other movies. There are other faces I recognized but the only other name I recognized was Dudley Sutton who's been around forever.

This is a very kinetic film. Others have likened it to a Guy Ritchie film and that is a more than fair assessment. Things move at near break-neck speed so the viewer doesn't have the time to get bored. All the production values and music are pro level so the bones don't show. My only gripe is that I barely understood one word of dialogue. The accents and slang are so thick I was only able to catch the general drift of what was happening. Had I had subtitles I'm sure this would have been even more interesting. As it stands it's a good watch. If you liked Green Street hooligans this should be right up your alley.",1290988800,,1293,4.273469387755102

2412915,1,B000BC8SYW,"First we had that quality film the Firm then we had the dross that followed it.  This film follows the exploits of chelsea lads who are part of a firm intent on violence towards other like minded individuals of other rival teams.

Problem is we get the same boring super firm stereotype, never get beat, all a 'larrf, over exaggerated cockney rhyming slang (Its like Alf Garnett on speed) walk like a penguin (or a 3rd rate imitation of Oasis) The film just drifts along at a walking pace to nowhere.  So what some of them live in nice houses, so what some of them have families (Haven't we seen this all before with the film The Firm?)

Boring, pointless and a waste of valuable time that could have been spent cleaning the drains or checking the guttering on the roof.",1203811200,,770,4.439716312056738

2412922,5,B000BC8SYW,This movie provides a glimpse into the lives of lower middle class English youth for whom savage battles over football matches and never heard of towns are the most important part of their otherwise quietly desperate lives. The poignant interplay between the two of old men in the movie somehow made the film seem more real and even more sad. The fight scenes really seemed to capture the chaos and confusion of that lifestyle. No explanations given and no apologies necessary. It held my attention from start to finish. A good watch for mature folks; the randomness of the violence intermixed with snippets of private life made the movie seem more real to me. I had to order this after watching it at a friend's house - He is a huge soccer fan and I believe he picked up the movie in Europe. Recommended.,1168300800,,805,4.597222222222222
2412923,5,B000BC8SYW,"Watch this movie.....Hooliganism and drugs...what else does a movie need....well, could have used a little more sex, but that's just my opinion.  Pure entertainment the whole way through.  Don't expect to see any football in this movie.  This movie portrays the passion of football....or maybe more so, Hooliganism.....but it's still good to be passionate about something in life, right?  Well written, good acting, & very humorous on top of everything else.  A must see for any football (proper football, as in 'soccer') fanatic, or for anyone else that is passionate about any one thing in life.",1167782400,,597,5.177083333333333
2412924,4,B000BC8SYW,"Full of mindless and senseless violence, `The Football Factory' may on the outset appear to be nothing more than male entertainment of the morally debased kind, but really it's a study on the inherent need for a sense of release.  It's about boys and men wanting, no needing, to get a few things off their chest, and if that means kicking in a few heads well then so be it.  They run the streets like gangs, setting matches where they freely beat each other mercilessly but when Tommy (Dyer) makes enemies with a rival team he ends up starting a war, and in the midst of that war he begins to wonder if this life he leads, living from one fight to one screw to one drink, is really worth the pain.  Bottom line is ""yes"" and so is this movie.  It may not be for everyone, and no it's not as `deep' as say `Fight Club' but it still packs a punch and proves a point, if you take the time to pay attention.",1160352000,,902,4.137142857142857

You know whose who if you follow football closely. Danny Dyer is every single disaffected bored male ever. Regardless of race, religion, and everything else you can relate to Johnson. Bright is at the other end of the spectrum where you love to hate the bully. All in all this is one of my favorite films.

8085050,3,B000BC8SYW,"I'm not sure what to say about this movie. It was so close to being great and brilliant, but there were several things that knocked it way back down to 2.5 stars, which is what I give it. The script is near brilliant, but the directing, production design and budget were just too amateur. It had a low budget feel to it, and the movie suffered tremendously for it. I feel like I would have given this 4-4.5 stars (which I don't usually do) had it been high budget, and creatively done, and with a much more talented cast. I would just say emphatically that I would have LOVED to see this movie directed by Danny Boyle. It would have been awesome to see what he could have done with this. Even Guy Ritchie would have been great for this.

I rented this off of the strength of Danny Dyer in ""Human Traffic."" His performance there was one of the best of my lifetime. He was so talented and creative. However, he just gives a very average performance here. The thing that shines the most, as I said, is Nick Love's script, which is an adaptation of John King's book. The production value hurts this movie tremendously, and makes it limp along. It's kind of sad to think of what this movie could have been. It is in the vein of ""Trainspotting,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" and ""Human Traffic."" The components were all there, it just didn't gel in the way that it should have, and that is a shame.",1446336000,,1379,4.344961240310077

8085054,5,B000BC8SYW,"Shame a couple reviewers rated  movie low because of the content, if the movie depressed you it probably proves that it was realistically shot and well acted. The Football Factory was relatively low budget, certainly compared to Hollywood, and utilised new actors for the most part, some had limited experience in minor TV roles. The large group scenes included real life hooligans (at least those not in prison). The movie is a one off and was unsuccessfully imitated by Green Street Hooligans ( so bad they had an American actor who had hardly heard of the game let alone the culture trying hard to sound like an east Londoner). The film is based on the John King book, which I'm not sure many people in this country have read. King's book being the first of a triology. (I doubt the the other 2 books will make film). The film follows the book fairly closely, while taking some liberties, revolving around the comings and goings of football gangs (firm) members. King is a Chelsea fan so his  book centered around a firm of Chelsea fans but this story could be written about any of a dozen, or more, footballs firms in the UK. A popular lifestyle that has been enthusiastically embraced for decades in UK for better or worse.
