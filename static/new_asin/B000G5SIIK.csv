8128906,5,B000G5SIIK,"The title, Colossal Sensation, probably loses a lot in the translation.  I have no idea what the original Hungarian means, but I urge people not to let this keep you from trying this wonderful film.

The Amazon reviewer gives you a good plot summary so I won't repeat that.  I just want to praise the humanity of the movie.  The twin brothers share a bond that is tried by a tragic accident that cripples one in childhood, a romance that threatens to separate them and then the intrusion of political events that sends both of them to prison.  The story spans the lifetime of the two fraternal twins, from birth to their old age.  Living in Hungary through the political events of the 20th Century, they see their share of the down side of things.  Yet they are clowns, born to a family of clowns and they manage to survive in spite of great hardship.

I found the actors extremely beautiful, not in a Hollywood way, but in the way that very deep and soulful people have.  The story  shows the gamut of human experience from tragedy to joy; there is love and loss, just like life.  If you appreciate life in all of its richness you might love this film.",1251417600,3,1153,4.4170616113744074
