8161945,5,B000LH9TV8,"I purchased this video for my dad who prefers the ""self-teaching"" approach to any hobby he takes on. He was absolutely ecstatic when he watched the video and he watches it over and over and over again. He is so sad that it's May and there is no snow to test out some of the moves. My dad is a tough critic, so for him to say that this video provides an excellent overview for all levels and is very inspiring, is saying a lot. Highly recommended!",1241222400,,446,4.137931034482759
8161946,2,B000LH9TV8,"Wow, did I ever feel I got taken on this.  The DVD suffers in three main areas:

1) Very amateurish production quality.  If this thing sold for $10-15 bucks I might be able to understand but NATO is asking $30 bucks for this thing on their site.  Terrible echo-ey sound quality, choppy/hacked chapter transitions in many cases

2) Instruction quality.  Only a few of the tips are demonstrated very effectively and many are given such short shrift that I wondered why they even bothered.  With that said there may be a couple of useful tips here for any given level but very few for advanced skiers with tips about skiing gloppy snow as an exception and some stuff about centering as it relates to lead transition at least interesting (just to show I'm at least trying to be fair).

3) Useless fluff.  WAY too much amateurish fluff material which should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Even if you find some of it amusing the first time or two, I'm bettig that, like me, you're going to regret that the disk is cluttered up with this mostly self indulgent and pretty much useless extra/bonus/fun/whatever material.",1174694400,4,1124,4.659898477157361
