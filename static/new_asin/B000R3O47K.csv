8198735,5,B000R3O47K,"This Fuji TV 2004 TV series is a story about a sports equipment company executive, Kenji Haruki (played by Yuji Oda), who becomes acquainted with a new next door neighbor, Yuki Aoi (played by Akiko Yada).  They both happen to work in the same company.  Yuki is a former ""girl gang"" member and has had a previous divorce from a spouse who abandoned her.  Kenji is initially turned off by Yuki and her manipulation of men to suit her needs, but happens to find a videotape made by her five years ago talking about her life threatening health condition.  Her illness is not completely explained, but appears to be related to chronic leukemia which requires a waiting period of 5 years to see if you have a complete remission.  The two begin to banter quite a bit being next door neighbors and they slowly develop a more intimate relationship.  They both, however, have other relationships with other people that intrude into their developing relationship.  They decide to place a wager on which one of them will fall in love first and the loser has to pay for the other person's trip to see the Aurora Borealis.  Yuki's past personal experiences impacts her somewhat cynical outlook on life which later is transformed by their new found love for each other.  Note that they both refer to each other by their surname and only start using the first name when they declare their love for each other.  Much of the earlier episodes have more comedic scenes and the final three episodes become more serious as Yuki has a relapse of her illness.  There are several side stories with the other office coworkers and their relationships.  The series has nice scenic photography that was shot in the mountains.  Typical of Japanese dramas, there is the usual comedic parts in the series (watch for the Elvis impersonation by Kenji's supervisor, the spoof of the ""Titanic"" movie, and when Kenji goes to buy baby formula).  The central theme of this TV series is the Christmas season and the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) in Yellowknife, Canada near the Arctic Circle.  The series starts and ends in that locale.  The majority of the miniseries is a flashback to three months prior to Christmas 2004 and how the two main characters became acquainted with each other.  The last half of the final episode returns to the present time and continues into the following year.  There are five romantic relationships that culminates from the series.  But of those five, I think that the only one that you can say with 100% certainty that it will be ""til death do you part"" is the one between Kenji and Yuki.  The series run time is approximately nine hours spanning 11 episodes.  A nice Xmas video presentation with 1980s Wham! songs sung by the main male actor (Yuji Oda).  Interestingly, Yuji Oda and Akiko Yada were both born in December.  Since this is a TV show, the violence was limited to two scenes involving someone being punched and a few expletive deleted words (shown in the English translation).

This item listing is the non-English subtitled version (only with Chinese subtitles).  There is an English subtitled version available by other sellers.  I do not recommend the Ember Power Malaysian subtitled DVD version.  The English translation was done very poorly and was often grammatically incorrect.
