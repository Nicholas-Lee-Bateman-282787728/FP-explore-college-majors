2525332,5,B000EOTSA0,"Way to think out of the box in telling a story that has brains, sex appeal and heartfelt struggles on so many levels!  I hope more filmmakers take notice...stop the monotony that's out there!",1145836800,5,191,4.617647058823529
2525333,5,B000EOTSA0,"Before I saw this movie I had never given much thought to the pharmaceutical industry. I got my prescriptions filled at Walgreens and took them dutifully, without any consideration as to how that presciption ended up in my hands.

'Side Effects' is eye-opening without being the least bit didactic as it follows new-grad Karly Hert's career trajectory as a pharmacutical rep. She masters the tactics her employers encourage her to use to peddle her wares to doctors, enjoying increasing financial success even as she questions the ethical implications of her work.

With a feel-good ending that I won't spoil, 'Side Effects' succeeds as both a post-college coming-of-age story and an investigation of the sales tactics of the pharmaceutical industry. Katherine Heigl is fantastic as the wide-eyed and increasingly jaded Karly, and don't miss Dorian DeMichele as Karly's unscrupulous boss. A must see.",1145836800,12,900,5.330985915492958
2525334,5,B000EOTSA0,"Side Effects is such a unique film.  Made on such a teeny-tiny budget, you'll surely be impressed by this first-time filmmaker's shot at indie film... I sure was!

I love films that take a look at something so real.  So many people are pharma reps, or have friends who are, or are graduating and being scouted by big pharma.. It was really interesting to see a film about a real person's account of ""life in the drug industry.""

At the same time, what a great story.  I totally related to the characters, and love the down-to-earth-feel that the film has.  Katherine Heigl did an amazing job.  She was so much fun to watch!  The music's also rocks.

Cheers to Side Effects!",1144627200,9,673,4.4958677685950414
2525335,5,B000EOTSA0,"I have been nothing but impressed with this small indie flick.  Side Effects defies all odds as one of the only independent films I have ever seen that tries to make a statement while keeping its head above water in a sea of Hollywood mass-production.  With a small budget, Side Effects manages to engage compassion, enlighten, and even stimulate your inner-activist.

Katherine Heigl from Grey's Anatomy proves that she is beyond capable of crossing over from television to the Silver Screen.  As Karly Hert (the seductive yet sweet pharmaceutical sales rep with a conscience) Heigl is powerful and believable. She is in over 90% of the film, and carries the load effortlessly.

If you are looking for something that Hollywood isn't giving you, or if you are at all interested in how those anti-whatever pills you were prescribed got from the factory to your medicine cabinet, check out Side Effects.",1144627200,6,901,4.98
2525336,5,B000EOTSA0,"I enjoyed this film for two reasons:

First, Katherine Heigl.  Being a huge fan of Grey's Anatomy and of Katherine Heigl I had a hunch I would enjoy this movie, but her performance was even better than I expected.  This is a bigger film role than normal for her, but she tackles it with ease and shows much more of her range than she does on Grey's.  She gets the driven, determined quality of the character perfectly, and gives all of her frustrations a great comic quality.  She's a very talented dramatic actress and this film suggests that she's an even better comic actress.  Her timing is near perfect.  And yes, she's devastatingly attractive and charming (was there any doubt there?).  I hope this opens doors for her...

Second, the message.  I happen to be a veteran of the pharmaceutical industry.  I hope everyone can see this film and get a glimpse of the marketing practices of big pharma.  It's fictional, obviously, but however hilariously absurd and gross the pharmaceutical industry may seems in this film, it's not an exaggeration.  If you're in the medical profession or doing anything that is even remotely connected to medicine or pharmaceuticals it should be mandatory.  Even if you're not - this affects us all.",1144022400,13,1235,4.791469194312796
2525337,4,B000EOTSA0,"If you were living in Madison, Wisconsin and Lucifer appeared at your front door, offered you a Mercedes, jewelry, and lots of ""mad money"" in exchange for your soul, would you accept the offer?  While no one is likely to enter into such a bargain with a horned man in red leotards, consider what happens when the ""he"" is a she employed by a major pharmaceutical company.  The twist on the temptation scenario is only one of the unexpectedly fresh innovations of Side Effects, an indie film written and directed by Kathleen Slattery-Moschkau.  The innovations are some of the film's most significant accomplishments and failures.  They deserve mention because they highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both the  writer-director and cast.

One startling aspect of the film is how many innovations it contains.  For example, the big money corporate drama unfolds in don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it Madison, Wisconsin.  An educated sales woman, Karly Hert played by Katherine Heigl, wrestles through a Faustian struggle.  Lucifer in this case takes the form of a stylish, attractive, sales executive named Jacqueline, played by Dorian DeMichele.  On Karly's other metaphoric shoulder sits an angelic influence in the form of a romantic suitor, Lucian McAffee's convincing Zach Danner.  Throughout the story women are on top of the power structure.  The main male is a stay at home character.  These items are strengths that set up the drama and propel it in a way that a documentary, for example, could not sustain.

The weakness of the film is how ineffectively its strengths are exploited.  The first third of the film meanders through the start of the romance between Karly and Zach, but Zach all but disappears during the second half. The conversations between the lovers about the pharmaceutical industry are preachy and overwrought.  Meanwhile Jacqueline, whose soulless complexity is subtly rendered by Dorian DeMichele's elegant craftsmanship, isn't even introduced until the second half.  The delayed insertion of her influence undermines the triangular Zach-Karly-Jacqeline dynamic that is the primary source of the film's dramatic tension.  The linchpin of Karly's entire struggle rests in her relationship to Jacqueline's utterance ""There is no issue.""  When she says those words Jacqueline shoulders the thematic weight of the film and its central issue with her post-modern perky delivery.  The phrase is a ubiquitous mantra of modern society.  It reverberates on every level of human interaction including individuals in denial, communities' attitude toward the marginalized, and politician's defense of failed policies.  Yet despite the timeliness of Jacqueline's comment, which she delivers with megaton force at the moment of Karly's final surrender, Karly barely responds.  Consequently the impact of the film's final resolution is diluted.

The tensions between the first third and second half of the film may reflect Kathleen's own Faustian struggle.  Perhaps she was uncertain whether to make a whistle-blowing documentary or a money-making feature film.  The way that she handles individual components of the film demonstrates that she understands the differences between the two.  However the irony of the final product is that the first third has the look and feel of a docudrama.  The latter two thirds come off as a relatively compelling thriller.  Either way the film introduces us to two women faced by momentous decisions, the character, Karly, and the filmmaker, Kathleen.  The difference between Karly-the-character and Kathleen-the-filmmaker is that by the end of the film Karly has made up her mind.",1141171200,10,3632,5.411032028469751
2525338,5,B000EOTSA0,"Saw this in a east village theater (two boots) and it rocked.

Katherine Heigl takes on a much meatier role than her current model/doctor-in-training in prime time.

Dorian DeMichele, who plays the ruthless yet seductive Jacqueline, is incredible.  I didn't know if I wanted to boo her or woo her!

It was a terrific and important movie for everyone to see, I cannot believe it was made so fast and with such a small budget.

2525355,1,B000EOTSA0,"Don't let other viewers' multiple stars fool you. Except for Heigl herself, there's nothing to recommend this movie. We realized early on that it was intended as an expose of the pharmaceutical industry (which is fine), but it only parodied how predatory that industry can be despite the good some products seem to do. With a better screenplay, better direction, better everything, the premise could have been dramatic and exciting, but instead the movie dragged through a numbing series of short, disjointed clips and situations with no resolution, except that girl finally quits her job, and boy and girl get together in the end. The credits at the end brag about how cheap the movie was to make, and the production values certainly showed that: For example, hotel rooms serve as offices and business conference rooms (watch for the little viewer in the door), and a home improvement display serves as the house where our star lives.

2525372,1,B000EOTSA0,"Karly (Heigel) is guided into becoming a medicinal drug representative, although she has ""never taken a science class"". She is taught that the 'secret' of a salespersons success lies in highlighting the benefits of the product to be sold  and hiding or making light of the negatives. This movie depicts Karly's (Heigel) struggle between continuing to earn thousands of dollars by concealing the dangerous side effects of the medication she is selling and her conscience. Done right, this may have been an informative watch, however this movie itself is really bad.  Please listen to the reviewers who label it as such.

 I am completely perplexed about why a successful high profile actress like Katherine Heigel would agree to star in this mundane, embrassing project. I can only conclude that she did it to bring awareness for personal reasons(like maybe a family member or a friend of hers has been hurt by a medicinal drug). Perhaps some of the profits from this movie were being donated to a charitable cause that she supports or maybe she got contractually trapped. Whatever the reason,even she, as the sole capable actress in the entire cast, looks bad.

 In essence this is a homemade-like movie with scenes lasting about a minute before the many long and very obvious black outs spew across the screen. Katherines Heigels complexion appears shiny and blotchy due to the poor lighting or bad make-up or both. Her love interest is just not believable - an unemployed man with some unfortunate male pattern balding that looks more like a hair piece that slipped back to the middle of his also shiny head.

 Even I, as a medical professional, found the content boring, the presentation ridiculous, the flow choppy and the story line frustrating to follow. It was difficult to understand the significance of some of the actors in the movie. For example ""Grace"", Karly's African American friend/or room-mate/or caretaker (still not sure what her role was) and Karly's father, (who also sported a glowing hairless scalp), who pops up in the movie, for a minute (equivalent to one scene in this flick), shares a crude, stupid comment and disappears.  Either these people were promised a part in this project, or included to try and tell us a little more about who Karly is and make us feel something for her, but failed in doing so. I believe the most likely explanation however is that this movie was probably twelve hours long and had to be cropped thereby eliminating all if any character development and adding to its choppiness.  Certain actions were also confusing such as Karly's pill popping. Was it Advil tabs that she was throwing back or pills lifted from her sales stash? Could this have been a contributing cause to her personality change. Mood changes were not listed as a side-effect of the drug and the movie does center around non-disclosure of certain side effects. Her random med guzzling would make sense in this case. I doubt this to be the reason, however, as this would require some type of depth,something completely absent here.

The final attempt to trap the viewer emotionally was the monologue of the spouse of a former patient. The scene synchronously flashed home album photos depicting the closeness of the spouse and his kindergartener partaking in different family activities. Unfortunately rather than touching the viewers heart the scene only reinforced the movies poor production quality as the quality of the home pics was 100% better.

Before paying a penny or wasting any time on this unfortunate mish-mash, I would recommend watching the trailer on amazon. This is actually the beginning of ""Side effects"" and an accurate indicator of the flow and content of the entire movie. I read the negative reviews on this board but still went on to watch it figuring that as I am pretty tolerant of most negatively rated shows, have a lemons-to-lemonade type personality and  love Katherine Heigel, I could overlook any negatives.

There is a lot more to pharmaceutical company corruption than this movie portrays, but it certainly reveals more than most people are aware of before seeing it.  I am concerned when friends and neighbors take prescription drugs without taking into account the side effects.  Even though there is plenty of information on the Internet about people's experiences with prescription drugs, few people take the time to research them before getting their prescriptions filled.  Even more concerning, few people realize that even their doctors don't know most of the really serious side effects.  This film brings awareness to the problem of the real dangers of drugs and the corruption of pharmaceutical companies.  I would suggest digging even deeper, but this movie is a great start.  Heigl is great as always, and although this is a low-budget film and does look it, it's worth watching and has a good storyline.

Here's an example of an interesting fact--did you know pharma reps get bonuses that may total in the tens of thousands when they get the doctors on their list to prescribe more of a particular drug?  That they get free late model cars to drive?  All of that is paid for by patients... This is an eye opening based on a true story movie.

I work in a physician's office and have loaned it to several pharmaceutical reps, all of whom say it really hits close to home.  I believe it was written by a former ""drug rep"".  The acting isn't great, plot was okay.  It was a low budget film, and it kind of shows.  But I'd watch it again.

2525387,3,B000EOTSA0,"""Side Effects"" is a recent, low budget film, showing the high budget con game the pharmaceutical companies play and the drug representatives role.  The material is meant to be a scathing, timely commentary on the pharmaceutical industry , however, the movie makes the issue seem trite and lukewarm.  Katherine Heigl plays the pharmaceutical salesperson who is making a big salary with plenty of bonuses.  Wrestling with her conscience, she needs the money and she feels she can push away any doubts on any drug's dubious health claims.  The truth hits her in the face one day, and she has to decide between her career and one true, average salaried boyfriend, Zach (Lucian McAffee).

The movie has a bad soundtrack, which irked my senses, plus the story was stiff and unnatural.  Katherine Heigl is beautiful, however,  her many costume and hair-do changes were distracting, and  felt  ""inserted"" to help her get future roles.  ""Side Effects"" did not flow well, and I felt an expose on the pharmaceutical industry should have been more of a documentary.  The scenes showing free gifts, mugs, and food buffets for doctors and staff are a big part of the sales as well as using pretty reps to get the male physicians to ""buy in"" to using new drugs.  Obviously fake interviews with physicians were inserted throughout the film and chopped up the story.

The story is about pharmaceutical salesperson Karly (Katherine Heigl) who makes the big bucks, but is her job worth the toll it takes on her conscience?  After many years of pushing pricey drugs without really knowing if they're safe or effective, Karly doubts her career choice daily.  A new love interest by the name of Zach hopes she will drop her job and move into the home he is building.  Karly is pulled both ways and has to make a hard decision, which is predictable.

""Side Effects"" has an amazingly weak script, amateurish direction and production, which prevents anyone from enjoying this clumsy watered-down expose.",1285027200,2,1978,4.909638554216867

2525389,4,B000EOTSA0,"Seemingly too simple at first, this film about the disillusionment of a 23 year old drug detail woman says it all about overselling of dangerous drugs. The huge rewards for all out drug pushing finally lost out to a woman with conscience who found out about fatal side effects in a soon-to-be-introduced antianxiety drug she would have to sell to doctors. Reactions of doctors to detail women are given across the spectrum quite accurately. The mishandling of honest researchers is very well presented. The only reason for 4 stars not 5 is saggy directing at times.

To see exactly the same plot, an actual true story is novelized in ""Pawn of Pharma"" by Evan Jacobs, 2005, to which I gave 5 stars.  Equally simple, yet all the corporate slime is there too.

The director brings light to the important topic regarding prescription drugs and a very light-hearted entertaining way. I have to admit I laughed out loud quite a few times. Katherine Heigl played her role brilliantly and her enthusiam for this project is transcended on the screen. Sure, there were times were the story seemed to wander off point, and the editing could have been better, but overall, the movie kept me entertained throughout, and educated me at the same time.  The bonus material was outstanding as well. I would recommend this film to anyone, just remember it is an indie film, made with a very limited budget.",1165795200,4,741,4.834645669291339
2525393,2,B000EOTSA0,"This has to be the worst movie I have watched in a very long time.

Katherine Heigl is a great actress but, this was a really bad script for her.  Do Not Buy............",1163030400,4,169,4.090909090909091
2525394,4,B000EOTSA0,"At the very beginning of ""Side Effects,"" our heroine, Karly Hert (Katherine Heigl), tells us that she sells drugs for a living, quickly adding that she does it legally.  Karly is not a drug pusher; she is a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company.  Writer/director/producer Kathleen Slatery-Moschkau worked several years in just such a job, so her objective here is to air the industry's dirty laundry and possibly convince you that drug pushers might not be that bad in comparison for the simple reason that the drug companies do not take as much of your money.

Katy is hired by the company, not because she knows anything about pharmaceuticals, but because she is a babe.  However, Katy is not really comfortable in a corporate world where making money is the bottom line and her boss prefers that she wear panty hose is she is gong to wear a skirt.  On the other hand, when they hired her they gave Katy a company car and that is nothing to sneeze at.  Then Katy meets Zach Danner (Lucian McAfee), who is the antithesis of the world in which she lives.  Zach's goal is build his own house and this ideal makes up for the fact he does not look like your typical leading man in a movie.  Still, Katy is committed to their future together and circles the date on the calendar when she will quit her job so they can go built their home in the woods.

At that point ""Side Effects"" takes an interesting satirical turn because Katy decides that instead of following the company's scripts for selling durgs she is going to tell doctors the truth (to wit, their product is not any better than comparable products by their competitors, just more expensive).  I thought Slatery-Moschkau was going to take more advantage of this approach, like they did in the Dudley Moore movie ""Crazy People"" did with its hysterical shtick of telling the truth in commercial advertising, but it becomes a minor yet ironic joke as her unorthodox approach makes Katy successful and gets her on the management track.  That means a nicer company car and as her unscrupulous company gears up for the release of the new anti-depressant that they want to turn into a billion dollar blockbuster, Katy finds herself being led into temptation and putting her future with Zach in doubt.

Although ""Side Effects"" is clearly a work of passion and personal commitment for Slatery-Moschkau, she clearly wears too many hats in making this film.  After all, this is her first film and her objectives would be better served by a writer and a director with more experience.  What she does have going for her is that she has gotten Katherine Heigl to play the lead role and even persuaded her to do a couple of semi-nude scenes (the term now being defined as seeing the side of the breasts but drawing the line at coming close to seeing a nipple).  Heigl has the babe part down and her winsome personality makes up for a lot of the flaws of this film.  However, I fully admit that in the end I round up on this film simply because while I would hope that the idea pharmaceutical companies are interested first and foremost with making profits is not news to anybody, it never hurts to be reminded of the fact and to take a look behind the curtain.

Slatery-Moschkau does a filmmaker commentary that offers an inside look at the making of the film, but also a medical commentary where she explores the medical issues brought up in the film, based on her decade working for the pharmaceutical industry.  So you can regulate how outraged you want to be by what these companies are doing as you go through the DVD's special features.  Slatery-Moschkau followed up this film with a documentary this year, ""Money Talks: Profits Before Patient Safety,"" which is obviously compatible with the position of this 2005 film.  Too bad the film does not offer any solutions to the problems it details beyond the basic belief that drug companies should not be doing what they are doing.",1155513600,31,3927,4.6473988439306355

Izzie has proven herself yet again by not only being beautiful and a great actress, but also caring about issues that matter.  Being the executive producer on this indie film shows she really follows her heart.  I knew she supported organ donation.  And with Side Effects she takes on the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry in a fun, light-hearted way!  Go girl!

It is entertaining, enlightening and just a scream.  It was the perfect choice for girls' night in.  We were laughing our (beep) off!

She should have taken the money the studios supposedly offered her and let them alter the script to make it watchable. Instead, she stuck with a crappy script and made the movie herself. Bad choice.",1151625600,7,305,4.773584905660377
2525403,4,B000EOTSA0,"This movie has a lot of strikes against it - the different ""locations"" are frequently the same room with furniture rearranged.  Narrative devices like text on screen or interlude interviews are picked up and abandoned at random.  Subplots (in particular, those involving Karly's best friend and the rest of her family) are never resolved, and the dialogue is frequently clunky exposition of company rhetoric.  Many of the supporting actors are obviously not in the same league as the main players, and it's not hard to predict the plot points of the film.

But the movie has heart and a winning lead actress in Katherine Heigl, and this movie has become one of my guilty pleasures.  As a medical professional, I have heard all of the arguments for and against drug reps as depicted in this film, but the scenes where Karly shows how hard it is to do her job were particularly convicting.  Corporate ethics aside, these are personal issues, and most of these people are just trying to pay the bills.  The movie really humanizes the industry reps, even if the characters themselves aren't exactly three-dimensional.

And yes, Katherine Heigl takes her top off.  Twice.  I would consider it exploitative except that she executive produced this movie, and in that case, if you've got it, flaunt it.  The brief nudity does fit logically into the scenes.

In the end, I recommend watching this movie with as light a heart as possible (and a little vodka, if you've got it).  It's not revolutionary, but it raises good discussion points, and it will give you a fix until you can see Katherine Heigl on the far superior Grey's Anatomy.",1151280000,15,1627,4.809352517985611

I had high hopes for this movie.  I love the topic (an expose of what rep.s really do to create markets for their drugs including all the bribery, freebies, and misinformation), but a plain old documentary would have been far more elucidating and enjoyable.  If this had been on TV, and I hadn't paid for it, I would have turned it off after 15 minutes.

2525406,5,B000EOTSA0,"Oh, Side Effects is a fairly good move.....  OK, now that I have your attention, I want to give my perspective having spent a lifetime in health care.  More of my 35+ year career as a clinical pharmacist and educator than I care to remember, has been spent talking with, frequently avoiding, and then ultimately undoing much of what pharmaceutical representatives say to prescribers.  I appreciate the message of this movie more than most viewers who are not involved in health care.  So, no attempt will be made to repeat the accolades of other favorable reviews, with which I am in complete agreement.  My message is to those who are intimately involved in providing health care and/or educating those who are or will be: doctors and others who prescribe (e.g., nurse practitioners, physician assistants); nurses; pharmacists; as well as all the other members of the health care team (e.g., social + behavioral health practitioners, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians/nutritionists, those involved in public health issues, and others who are inadvertently and regrettably forgotten).

Sure, watch the movie; be entertained.  But don't stop there.  Writer and director Kathleen Slattery-Moschkau readily admits that her approach was to use a presentation form that would have the broadest possible appeal.  That is, if making an entertaining movie would attract people who would otherwise not watch a documentary, then ultimately more people will hear the message.  As with most compromises, however, this results in some dilution of the message.  So, if you are in health care, please, also watch the commentaries by Ms Slattery-Moschkau, especially the ""medical commentary"" included in the DVD.  And, most of all PLEASE (purchase) and watch the accompanying documentary titled Money Talks: Profits Before Patient Safety.  This documentary should be required viewing in all health care educational programs.
