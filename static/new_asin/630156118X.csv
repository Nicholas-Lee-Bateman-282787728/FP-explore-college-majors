337934,4,630156118X,"In the 1980's a popular genre of movie was a comedy that included parodies of other popular movies. These included Airplane!, The Naked Gun, and Amazon Women on the Moon.

Somehow I missed UHF, which I just watched for the first time on Starz. It holds up. It was still hilarious to me -- though I'm of the right age to appreciate it. I don't know how my millennial daughter would see it.

Like these other movies UHF includes a bunch of well-known genre actors like Kevin McCarthy from the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Billy Barty from the 1939 Wizard of Oz. This only adds to the charm. The stars of UHF are ""Weird Al"" Yancovic and Michael Richards who that same year (1989) began his role of Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld. Both are brilliant in UHF.

My favorite parts are the fantasy sequences parodying Raiders of the Lost Ark and Rambo, and the Weird Al music video of The Beverly Hillbillies to the tune of Dire Straits' Money for Nothing.

I even liked the anti-gun spot ending with the tagline, ""Guns don't kill people. I do.""

I'm sorry that Weird Al (who not only stars in it but co-wrote it) hasn't done more comedy movies. He's as good at it as he is as one of the best musical parody artists",1523059200,,1211,4.364444444444445

It just dragged on and on... Every time you though the movie might pick up with a parody, it just fell flat and was over before you knew it.

All the shouting in the movie was driving me nuts too. Will never watch this again. If you want a good parody movie about TV and movies... I would suggest taking a look at Stay Tuned. Way better movie, that still to this day does not have a blu ray release.",1511740800,,573,4.162162162162162

338064,4,630156118X,"I'm a huge fan of Weird Al, so I really have no excuse for not watching ""UHF"" sooner.  I've known that it's a cult classic and, while no masterpiece, is generally considered one of the funniest films out there, and I even owned a copy of it.  I just never got around to watching it for years... and finally decided to amend that.  And boy, am I sorry I didn't see it sooner.  It's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's so gloriously over-the-top and unabashedly goofy in its execution that it's nearly impossible NOT to enjoy, and it proves that a comedy movie need not rely on constant sexual or toilet humor to be utterly hilarious.

""UHF"" stars ""Weird Al"" Yankovic in his first (and so far only) leading role as George Newman, an overly-imaginative everyman who can't seem to hold down a job.  When his uncle puts him and his more down-to-earth friend Bob in charge of Channel 62, an old UHF station, they find that not only is the station derelict and stuck playing tired re-runs, but the rival Channel 8 holds a monopoly on the airwaves and is run by a sadistic tyrant.  George, undeterred, sets out to revitalize the station... and ends up filling the airwaves with a variety of oddball and bizarre shows that, nonetheless, are a hit with the community.  Soon Channel 62 is number one in the ratings... but Channel 8 isn't going down without a fight, and soon George will need help from the entire town to save the UHF station and keep his wacky lineup on the air.

If you're expecting an intelligent film, look elsewhere.  But for what it is, ""UHF"" is brilliant -- a comedy that isn't afraid to be completely goofy and wacky and sets out to mine most of its humor from slapstick and visual gags instead of sexual innuendo and toilet jokes.  Clean comedy (or at least semi-clean) has become a lost art in Hollywood, and finding a film that's hilarious without being completely gross is quite refreshing.  Plus the sight gags, goofy visuals, and frequent pop-culture jokes (with light-hearted jabs at ""Rambo,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Gandhi,"" and Dire Straits' ""Money For Nothing"") are just plain funny, and have spawned images and phrases that still circulate on the Internet today (Wheel of Fish or ""you get to drink from the firehose"" anyone?).

As for the acting... Weird Al essentially plays himself by another name in this film, which isn't all bad.  He's a master of sly humor and deadpan delivery, but also knows when to cut loose and be wacky or angry in his humor.  The other actors (including Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, Kevin McCarthy, and Emo Phillips) either ham it up or manage a deadpan but still comedic delivery in their performances.  Michael Richards in particular is great as the bumbling janitor-turned-kids-show-host Stanley, while Kevin McCarthy chews up scenery at an alarming rate as the villain.

A must-watch for Weird Al fans, and a goofy but hilarious comedy for anyone who appreciates humor that doesn't rely exclusively on sex and potty humor to get a laugh.  It's a shame Al's acting career never really took off, as I would have loved to see him in more comedies.  At least he still has his delightfully funny musical career to enjoy...",1508803200,,3198,4.698924731182796

It was enjoyable to watch and laugh with our kids once again.

338113,5,630156118X,I am becoming too old to be entertained by television shows.  I have not been able to enjoy Hollywood;s films for 30 years.  UHF is an example of what Hollywood could be doing--not making a way out comedy but producing a creatively well done film.  This film stands alone (or nearly alone) in its unique approach.  The film  may be a little like Walter Mitty but it just goes way beyond what the viewer could anticipate happening next.  The highest recommendation.

The references are dated, the cameos are lost on a younger audience, and the soundtrack paradies songs on the ""classic"" station now.

Teaching poodles how to fly, drinking from the fire hose, revealing what's in the box, visiting Uncle Nutsy's clubhouse, giving a 1947 double-dye Denver mint penny in change, checking the supplies closet, returning your overdue book to Conan, shopping at Spatula City, and so much more.

It has Weird Al and Michael Richards  from the 80s - that should set the stage enough to know it's going to be goofy.  So as long as you aren't expecting Shakespeare, you might like this.  There are parodies of movies like Rambo and comedy bits throughout the movie.  Michael Richards is pretty funny as Stanley Spadowski the Janitor.  I enjoyed this movie.

By the way, Weird Al himself is just a super nice guy, to boot.

338863,4,630156118X,"I can't blast this movie since it's been a part of me so long as a 1st generation Weird Al fan.  The story is pretty simple and is an avenue for Weird Al and cast to showcase their skills.  A guy has to make a failed UHF station work or else with the help of a group of misfits.  Some hits and misses on the bits.  Vintage Michael Richards is not to be missed.  Weird Al kind of floats around as a normal guy in scenes, but when he day dreams the brilliance comes out.  The famous Beverly Hillbilly sequence is one such instance (now a classic) and came out of this movie.  He also pokes fun of Rambo to great effect.  Kevin McCarthy plays a great heavy and Victoria Jackson is a bit underutilized in her talents as the ""straight"" girl.  So it's really a mindless romp with some flecks of creativity reminds me of Wayne's World in a way.  Writing and production have come pretty far since 1989, but if you're a Weird Al fan and like something different, it's worth a watch for historical value.",1442275200,,994,4.23936170212766

I saw him at the Bloomsburg Fair (Pa) years ago, and like his music videos too, but if you enjoyed Buckaroo Bonzai, Earthgirls are Easy, or Galaxy Quest, you will enjoy this too.

339016,5,630156118X,"Hilarious movie from one of comedy's kings. Weird Al Yankovic takes a bit of a break from his supremacy over music to star in a comedy that hits all the high notes from its era. Obviously a product of the 1980s, specifically around 1987 (it was released in 1989), it features character actors from the era like Mike Richards and Fran Drescher--and pokes fun at all the funny stuff of its day. It parodies ""Rocky,"" ""Rambo,"" infomercials and game shows, telethons, and local-access cable TV itself.

The plot is there to allow Weird Al to do his thing. George and his friend Bob (played wonderfully by David Bowe) keep getting fired because George's overactive imagination and total lack of work ethic or professionalism keep offending their bosses. George has a rather banal girlfriend played by Victoria Jackson, channeling Teri Garr from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (an association knocked home in a scene where George starts sculpting her mashed potatoes into Devil's Mountain, saying breathlessly, ""This is important."") George's uncle, a gambling addict, wins a cable-TV station at cards and his wife forces him to let George manage it. The station has two employees: Fran Drescher's Pamela, a secretary who really wants to be a news reporter, and Anthony Geary's Philo, who seems to be sort of a handyman and technician (he brings an otherworldly, surreal sort of genial bafflement to the character, stealing every scene he's in). George immediately gets into a conflict with the demonic owner of the network affiliate, R.J. Fletcher, who rules his demesne with an iron fist. Fletcher's evil is established early on when he fires the innocent, childlike, mentally-slow janitor for something the janitor didn't even do--but George hires Stanley immediately. When George's station starts becoming really popular, Fletcher knows what must be done.

The stage is set for a class comedy, as the rough-edged local kids fight the rich, nasty businessmen who want to destroy them. George's imagination is all he's got to fight against Fletcher's superior resources and acumen--but he's also got the love of his audience and friends.

Is this a perfect movie? Of course not; a lot of its humor doesn't quite carry to the modern age. Some dialogue, characters, and situations presented wouldn't fly in today's world. But in terms of narrative structure, characterization, and sheer fun the movie brings, it is going to stand as one of the classics--up there with ""Airplane!"" and ""Hot Shots."" There isn't much else one will find from this era that will delight as much as ""UHF."" It's suitable for kids or adults, though people who were around in the 80s will probably like it more than younger people.",1441584000,,2703,5.042505592841163

There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love Weird Al, and deranged lunatics. If you love Weird Al, you'll love UHF. Frankly, if you love Weird Al, you've probably see UHF a dozen times already.

It's basically a sketch comedy film. There is an over arcing story about Al's character running a TV station. But mostly its a bunch of mini skits of the various shows his station produces. It's hilarious. It's definitely in a defined Weird Al style.

It's also a throw back to another era, back when the UHF channels on the TV dial were the only place to go for off branded oddball crappy television. It wasn't like it is now where you can get crappy television on 200 channels. This movie wouldn't work today, as it would be called ""Another generic crummy channel on cable that has some dumb show about a fake celebrity who's only famous for making a sex tape"". But back in the day, you got 1, maybe 2 channels on the UHF stations...and it was the only place to see low budget slop. Ahh...those were the days. Of course UHF TV in real life never had programming as good as Ghandi II, but it was okay.

UHF reminds you of those days, while being filled with Weird Al awesomeness.

But I still enjoyed the show mostly--especially the amazing performance by Michael Richards. He truly stole the show. His portrayal was not only comical, it was endearing.

The satire is seldom banal like a Wayans parodies (Think Scary Movie: ""Ha-ha-that's-funny-because-it's-a-thing-I-recognize"" type jokes)  and while a lot of the subject matter is dated (UHF vs Network television stations) the treatment is timeless and enjoyable.  It has a lot of elements of Zucker movies like The Naked Gun and Airplane!, but steers clear of the raunchy humor, and strangely also avoids bodily function humor as well.  Another thing that makes this movie stand out to me is that despite being a silly movie, the characters are actually quite likable and work really well for the underdog vs. establishment template.

The Blu-ray carries over all the extras from the DVD while adding a hilariously entertaining extra from the 2014 Comic-Con Panel. There's no issues with video and the audio that I can see and/or hear.

One small complaint about Shout Factory-sure they have offered a remaster onto Blu Ray, but for dvd owners there's also the Compleat Al documentary.

THE STORY: Music parodist ""Weird Al"" Yankovic plays George Newman, a guy who's always daydreaming. This causes him to lose one job after another. Then one evening his aunt & uncle hire George to manage local UHF station channel 62, which his uncle won ownership of in a poker game. The little station has been on the brink of bankruptcy for years, so with nothing to lose George puts his wildly creative imagination to work and concocts a programming line-up so unbelievably strange that soon the whole town is tuning in to see what's next. For instance there's ""Raul's Wild Kingdom,"" where, among other things, the wildly enthusiastic host teaches poodles how to fly! Other off the wall shows include ""Chef Barney's Bowling for Burgers,"" ""Leave It To Bigfoot,"" ""The Volcano Worshiper's Hour,"" and ""Strip Solitaire."" And of course Channel 62's number one show ""Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"" where CHANNEL 62's dim-witted janitor, (a side-splitting breakout performance by a pre-Seinfeld Michael Richards), hosts a kids' show so dementedly sick that even adult viewers love it. (""You're a lucky, lucky little boy! You found the marble in the oatmeal. That means you get to drink from... The Fire Hose!!!"") R.J. Fletcher, owner of the town's local network affiliate, is outraged when the tiny little UHF station suddenly begins to top his in the ratings. He hatches a nefarious scheme to eliminate Stanley Spadowski, buy U62 from George's uncle and bulldoze the TV station into a parking lot! To stop the network mogul's plans George will have to raise a lot of money in a very short amount of time, so a telethon is launched to save U62 ...but the clock is ticking! Will George & his friends be able to triumph over the cold-hearted, big money plans of Channel 8's cruel owner or will the little station that could go belly up at midnight??? Tune in and find out!

THOUGHTS: The movie is lots of fun and you're almost certain to laugh at the undeniably silly movie & TV parodies. (For a real hoot, freeze frame the U62 scheduling board and check out some of the various TV show titles! LOL!) Weird Al gets major help from up & coming comedy star Fran (The Nanny) Drescher as U62's receptionist/anchorwoman, and Victoria (SNL) Jackson has a cute role as Weird Al's long-suffering girlfriend. Gedde (16 Candles & Gung Ho!) Watanabe plays an grouchy neighbor of Al's who runs a beginner's karate school and winds up hosting U62's ""Wheel of Fish"" (""Stupid! You're so STUPID!""). There's also the presence of sci-fi icon Kevin (1951's Invasion of The Body Snatchers) McCarthy, chewing up the scenery in grand style as the villainous network affiliate Channel 8 manager, R.J. Fletcher. Legendary soap opera star Anthony Geary has a hilarious role as U62's in-house studio technician, Philo - a decidedly odd fellow who isn't quite what he seems!

THE BLU-RAY: I wanted a chance to upgrade my DVD of Weird Al's infamous UHF movie to this new Blu-ray version but sadly I must report that the transfer has some noticeable over-saturation issues compared to the old DVD release. Sharpness & detail are an improvement though. Most of the bonus features have simply been ported over from the DVD. Even so, if you don't own the film and have a Blu-ray player then this is a worthwhile purchase. Otherwise, it's a double-dip recommended ONLY for hardcore Weird Al fans like myself. 4 STARS",1431302400,3,3770,4.813271604938271

340082,5,630156118X,"Weird Al Yankovic has had an unpredictably successful career. His parodies have proved to be massively popular (including a Star Wars spin on the song American Pie ). A lot of fans may or may not be aware that he has a Hollywood production movie that was released back in 1989, possibly because it was a box-office failure. Granted, it was released in the summer, running up against real blockbuster successes as Lethal Weapon 2, Ghostbusters II, Batman, and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (among many others) so that probably contributed to its flop.

However, in the years since, this film has achieved a massive cult following, prompting MGM to finally release a DVD Special Edition in 2002, which was out of print for a few years after that. Now here we are, 25 years after the films initial release, and UHF has finally received the home video release it deserves: in glorious, high-definition blu-ray, complete with tons of bonus features to boot. Before I get too technical about this, lets get into the film itself.

*Minor Spoilers Ahead*

George Newman (played by Weird Al himself) is an avid daydreamer whose imagination seems to get him fired from every job he gets, along with his best friend Bob (David Bowe). He also seems to have trouble being on time to dates with his girlfriend, Teri (Victoria Jackson), always an hour late to each meeting. Soon after, he attends a party where his well-off Aunt Esther and Uncle Harvey Bilchik (Stanley Brocl.) Harvey wins the rights to a UHF station called U62 in a high-stakes poker game, and Aunt Esther offers a job to George to manage the station.

George and Teri arrive at the station and meet an eccentric engineer named Philo (Anthony Geary), who lives at the station, constantly testing new gadgets for no obvious reason. The station secretary, Pamela Finklestein (Fran Dreschner) tells George that the mailman accidentally delivered a package that was meant for Channel 8, and George insists on delivering the package to the owner, Mr. R.J. Fletcher, who turns out to be a cynical maniac who kicks George out of Channel 8s station almost immediately.

As George and Bob begin to manage the station, their ratings quickly decline, due to the fact that they have no interesting shows on television (including the supposedly kid-friendly Uncle Nutzys Clubhouse) and George almost gives up hope, offering the Clubhouse show to the station janitor, Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards). Minutes later, Stanley turns the kids of the show into excited little tykes, and Stanley Spadowskis Clubhouse is an instant hit.

As the ratings begin to rise for the station, George and Bob create bizarre, new shows to air on their station (including Bowling for Burgers, Wheel of Fish, and Conan the Librarian.) This only makes the stations popularity even more massive, peaking the station at number one, above Channel 6- which catches the unforgiving eye of R.J. Fletcher.

Later, Uncle Harvey receives a call notifying him that none of the horses he bet on recently had won the race, and that he owes $75,000 to a mob boss named Big Louie. Mr. Fletcher offers to buy U62 from Harvey to turn into a parking lot, and Harvey instantly accepts. When Aunt Esther hears of it, she convinces Harvey to give George two days to raise the $75,000 needed to save the station, and Stanley hosts a telethon to sell shares so they can reach their goal to pay Harveys debt to Big Louie.

Unlike other comedies that try to be funny through stupidity, this film actually is quite successful at its attempt to do so. Of course, that may be in part to my fandom of Weird Als music, but it makes one wonder how popular this film would be now if he hadnt become a musical success. The film is just so quotable, and I cannot stop from bursting out with laughter at almost each and every quotable moment in the film. UHF also succeeds at parodying many famous portions of scenes from classic films, including Gone with the Wind, Rambo, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Of course, my favorite aspect about this comedy is how quotable it is. I could fill up pages of quotes from this film that I laugh at no matter how many times I hear them. From combining a mortuary with Toys-R-Us, to an entire warehouse store dedicated to selling only spatulas, UHF is filled to the brim with comedic references and running jokes that it makes some of the most classic comedies look like droll, boring dramas. The plot can become so hilariously ridiculous that you almost forget about it, simply laughing at the stupidity of it all. If you haven't seen this gem of a cult classic, I highly recommend it: just try not to take it too seriously.

More fun than a Twinkie-wiener sandwich, UHF is a lost gem that deserves recognition as one of the funniest parody films ever made. Weird Al Yankovic is simply brilliant in this film, and the supporting cast makes it that much better. Some of the jokes and references are so stupidly hilarious, I guarantee that if you watch the film, you will never forget it, nor regret it.",1429056000,4,5035,4.730900798175599

340159,5,630156118X,"What more is there to say?  A great re-issue and increase in quality for a classic movie that didn't get a fair shake on it's original theatrical release.  Delayed gratification is better than none, I suppose.  Too bad it originally did so poorly at the box office - who knows what other awesome movies we could have had from Al had this done better originally.  If you are a Weird Al fan and like the movie, it's worth getting.  The extra's are pretty cool too - but I was more than satisfied with the better video and audio quality; the greatly improved quality over the DVD more than justified the purchase on it's own.  The extras were more a nice bonus for me (but still greatly appreciated!)",1421366400,,697,4.448818897637795
340160,5,630156118X,"I hate to use a cliche, but they don't make movies like this anymore.  UHF was made in a time when a lot artists were given free reign over their product without being forced to make an otherwise niche product mainstream.  That being said, UHF is pure Weird Al.  In place of the music parodies are parodies of movies and tv shows.  Gahndi, Rambo, Conan, the Beverly Hillbillies, Indiana Jones, and Network are just a few of things that are skewered.  In the midst of watching the movie though, the thing I love above all is that Weird Al's character (and really in real life) always champions the underdog weirdo, which is really what this movie is about.

The fun thing about this movie is that all the characters are likable and, as stated, easy to root for.  The story is a good simple story about saving a little UHF station run by Weird Al's character.  The supporting cast in league with Al could be best be described as lovable misfits.  Not least of which is the janitor turned television personalty Stanley Spadowski, played wonderfully by Michael Richards.  He owns this character.  Not to be outdone, Kevin McCarthy plays a villain on the verge or cartoon villainy, which is at home in a move starring Weird Al.  Fran Dreshcer also appears as a newscaster and Victoria Jackson, who, for whatever reason, I never appreciated at her time on SNL, is absolutely adorable in her role here and is the perfect person to play Al's girlfriend.

So if you know the movie, what about the other stuff.  The movie on DVD is pure fan service.  A great, light and humorous audio commentary along with deleted scenes are the highlights. The remastering is top notch.  I think this movie was never appreciated in its day.  In truth, it is something for the fans and may not have the mainstream appeal of similar type comedies like the Naked Gun or Airplane.  But looking back, it's so fun and good hearted, it's hard not to like.",1421193600,,1923,4.573099415204679

340217,5,630156118X,"This film is just flat out funny.  Anyone who gives this film a negative review is missing the point.  It is a satire film making fun of the films coming out in the 80's time period.  A lot of the skits will make you die laughing they are extremely funny. The film is not as well known because it bombed at the box office coming out in 1989 againt Lethal Weapon, Batman, Indian Jones and the Last Crusade.  The film was doomed right out of the gate trying to compete against those summer blockbusters.  Few people saw the film at the theatres and it was seen as a failure for Weird Al.  The film is a cult classic now as it should be because it is a great comedy movie.

I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a funny silly movie.  The film is a joy to watch.  You do not have to be a big Weird Al fan to enjoy the movie.

340282,5,630156118X,"I am a hardcore Weird Al Yankovic fan, so this movie was perfect for me. The special effects are as cheaply made as the ones he uses in his music videos, the plot is ridiculous as his videos, and the acting is on par with that in his videos. For the average viewer looking for a good movie, those are horrible qualities, but for a Weird Al fan looking for some of Al's quirky humor, it is perfect. It has its place even for the non Weird Al fans, but they would likely rate it 3 stars, maybe 4 depending on what their individual taste were.

In all honesty, this movie was way before it's time. These days I see all sorts of movies taking much the same approach years later such as, ""Not Another Teen Movie"", ""Epic Movie"", or ""Scary Movie"". This was made in the late eighties, and I somehow doubt the world was quite ready for it when it came out. If you don't like Weird Al, and you don't like the above mentioned movies, this movie is not likely to be your cup of tea. If you do like Weird Al, then this is an essential part of his history.

The paper-thin plot, for example, is really only there to serve as a vehicle from one skit or song to the next, like the host of a feature-length variety show. Al must have mingled with the right circles on the comedy scene, though, because an odd blend of before-they-weres fill out UHF's cast: Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson and an especially hyperactive, scene-stealing Michael Richards would all go on to bigger things later in life.

Siskel and Ebert hated the film and insulted Yankovic. Orion Pictures produced the film at a time when they were going broke. Also, UHF was beaten at the box office by other big budget movies such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and Lethal Weapon 2. We found the soundtrack album for UHF on CD in a record store in 1998. Yankovic plays George Newman, a struggling, working class guy who turns a UHF TV station into a success. The film has an upbeat, Frank Capra-ish tone. There's some good supporting roles played by Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson, Michael Richards, Billy Barty, David Bowe, and Kevin McCarthy. UHF is funny and creative. It spoofed 1980's pop culture. UHF spoofs Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981) and Rambo First Blood Part II(1985). UHF does have some racial stereotypes and animal cruelty jokes.

I enjoyed the premise of this movie and the characters in it. Frankly, the supporting cast is way more entertaining than weird Al is. For that reason it's worth a look. It has some funny bits in it right along side some unfunny ones. So take it from there. This one is something you have to decide for yourself. I enjoyed seeing it again after all these years. However; now it will sit on the shelf and maybe I'll have another look at it in oh about ten years.",1354320000,,739,4.103448275862069

The wittiness of his lyrics and effort at recreating the music in his CDs is impressive.  And having gone to his concerts, you know that he really puts on a show--numerous costume changes, for example.  So would it surprise anyone that the DVD for UHF would be more than just a movie?  Wait till you hear the commentary.

Al and director Jay Levey lead a hilarious commentary with numerous ""guest calls"" and an astounding detail of facts provided by Al.  Who has the addresses of all the scenes shot in Tulsa?  Al does!  One can sense that this movie was a labor of love.  I won't belabor the comments here about the movie--it is very funny although corny in Weird Al style.

340369,4,630156118X,"he's one of my all time heroes both musically and comedically. most remarkable in this day and age, he manages to eschew blue material and still be funny. (not out of any sort of grandstanding or even dislike, i suspect - he does cite edgier fare like Monty Python and Spinal Tap in his commentary - so much as simply priding himself on not having to resort to that.) he's one of rock's (if not music's) few true stand-alones, one of the often cited but only rarely actually encountered artitst to literally be in a class by himself.
given the magic that is ""Weird Al"" Yankovic on record, why shouldn't he branch out into other forms of performance? others have made the same transition, after all. (in particular i find myself from time to time wanting to see if Al could go the distance with Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles on WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? i bet he could.) and Al's one foray into movies, while it has it's fair share of weaknesses, is still an impressive start. it always leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth because you can tell he had at least one more film in him, if only the juggernaught hadn't quashed his chances to actually make it. (although, he's only in his 50s, so there could still be time.)
the big problem with the film was it's timing. it's subject matter was even then a dying phenomenon. for the first few decades of television, channels 2 through 13 tended to be where the ""official"" channels, the network affiliates and PBS, resided. channels 14 and upward, the realm of ""ultra-high frequency,"" were free ground for local ""performers"" and their own unorthodox styles. but alas, the phenomenon was on it's last legs even then, thanks largely to the growning popularity of cable tv, and finally disappeared officially into oblivion sometime in the '90s. around the same time the film's cult following began to blossom. there's something poetic about that.
if it has a single glaring weakness it's that it doesn't take enough advantage of Al's true forte, music. the signature moment (Al fantasing about being Mark Knoplfer singing about The Beverly Hillbillies), is the one bit of it's kind. what makes this especially sad for me is that the soundtrack album contains one of his most underated songs, serenading Gilligan's Island a' la Tone Loc, which is plenty approriate for the film. (to say nothing of the fact that Gilligan beats the hell out of Hillbillies any day!!)
but enough about what's missing. what the film does offer is a fresh angle for Al's unique brand of spoofery. the plot, with it's desperate dash to raise funds to save his station, is strictly been-there-done-that, but it fits Al's style. his Walter Mitty-esque character is an excellent platform from which to launch farcical commercials (""Spatula City""), unusual action series (""Conan The Librarian""), and would-be blockbuster movies (""Ghandi II""). an excellent cast - Michael Richards, Kevin McCarthy, Victoria Jackson, David Bowe (not BowIE, Bowe), Sue Ane Langdon, Fran Drescher, Stanley Brock, Billy Barty - doesn't hurt either.
as cool as the movie is, i think my favorite part is the commentary. (i like DVD commentaries as a concept, but how often has it boiled down to little more than actors and directors blowing their own horns?) Al and director/manager Jay Levey give us a surprisingly comprehesive overview of the experience, warts an' all. we learn how Orion Pictures, then on the ragged edge of their eventual bankruptcy, made the mistake of sending in a simple goofball B-movie to hold it's own with such blockbusters as GHOSTBUSTERS II and INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE, and how Al's was but one of many days ruined when the movie failed. he even rubs it in the faces of the dismissive critics by reading back their reviews of one of the many projects they had prematurely dismissed. the making of this film, the aftermath of it's disastrous box-office performance, and it's recovery at the hands of the passage of time might make for an interesting movie in and of itself.
they may not, as claimed, have it ALL on UHF, but they do have plenty.",1340064000,,4073,4.786931818181818
340370,4,630156118X,"I got this on DVD, wondering if it was as funny as I remember from childhood. Well, it is. It's ""Weird Al"" Al Yankovic (Alfred Matthew Yankovic) making parodies of many of the popular movies of the time (this was made in 1989) while keeping a plot of his own.

The DVD contains these cut scenes (SPOILERS!):

-Two extra endings for the Emo thumb-severing scene(in the first he places the severed thumb in his pocket, and in the second he puts it in his mouth for safekeeping).
-Extra scenes of George and Teri exploring U62; scenes of George talking to the receptionist at the dentist's office where Teri works; George being turned down for a loan; J.R. practicing for his anti-U62 telecast; Richard making fun of Macintosh; a whole sub-plot about the Head Thug being afraid of insects, attempting to steal a briefcase full of U62's money and stealing a briefcase full of bugs Philo had collected instead, concluded by the thugs opening the briefcase while driving home and crashing; and other 'exciting moments' that were not funny enough to stay in the film.
-Alternate scenes were filmed with Stanley singing 'Helter Skelter' instead of 'Bonanza.'
-A brief gag taking place when the thugs knock on Stanley's door; they say ""Pizza!"" and Stanley responds ""Pizza who?""
-Other scenes which did not make it include an explanation of why the martial arts teacher showed up to save George and Stanley (on the commentary Al said that it was decided that no one would really care); another gag in the ""Indiana Jones"" parody had a payphone in the cave ring, George picking it up and a voice begging him not to go in(and him hanging up and, of course, going in anyway); and more footage of the Kipper Kids(the guys with the big chins at the telethon).
-More scenes were originally scheduled for Trinidad Silva (Raoul) but he was killed by a drunk driver during shooting. Scenes included a piece at the end where Poodles attack him in vengeance for the ones he 'taught to fly.' It was briefly considered to re-shoot his scenes with someone else who could finish them but it was finally decided to just leave his scenes in and forget the unfilmed ones. The movie (if you watch to the very end) was dedicated to his memory.

(The above cut scenes were copied from IMDB; no plagiarism is intended.)

I really like this movie, even as an adult. My ten-year-old daughter loves it. I gave it four stars instead of five because you can watch the movie (but not the cut scenes) for free on the web with a little bit of searching. It's still funny, and even though I don't think it's one of Al's best projects, it's still better than the many ""Scary Movie"" or ""American Pie"" sequels.",1339459200,,2665,4.639830508474576

Unlike the perverted, violent movies of today, UHF has barely any cussing, no sexual actions, no disgusting violence(except teaching poodles to fly or the one and only Twinkie Wiener Sandwich).

The first time you watch this most of you may think it was a bit too silly, but soon after you watch it you will begin quoting it. Then you'll want to watch it again, and the cycle begins. Soon you will be looking for Spatula City, disliking badgers, or even searching for ""Gandhi II"" in movie stores. Some of the parts of the movie will not be understood by younger people. Examples are parodies TV shows like ""Network"", ""Conan the Barbarian"",the song ""Money for Nothing"", and much more. Even though they might not understand the old tv shows, Yankovi's hilarious facial expressions and hysterical ideas will make them roar with laughter.

I highly recommend you buy this amazing movie. It was overlooked by the world and is slowly coming back in force. It is worth every penny, or even a doubled die 1955 Denver mint penny if you have one. Not only is the movie great, the soundtrack is also wonderful.

340422,5,630156118X,"... which failed as a huge hit, but it has become a major cult film.  ""Weird Al"" is also a pretty good actor, but he wrote a role for himself, so he knew what he could do and couldn't.  Fran Drescher and Michael Richards, both known for specific roles in sitcoms, did great work acting.  Michael Richards is just as good here as he was in Seinfeld, if not better.  He does a lot of great acting, but it's his improvised moments, and several of the scenes of his character's TV show that make his performance what it is.  Because they had so much of him, they had to delete several scenes that he did, but the great part is that this DVD has deleted scenes, including the full version of one of his improvised performances.  Fran Drescher does just as good a job here as she does on her sitcom.  However, she's much more sane in this film than on the Nanny.  The scene where she first appears is one of her best moments.

Some other actors include Gette Wattanabe from Sixteen Candles, Victoria Jackson from Saturday Night Live, and David Bowe (not to be confused with David Bowie) who has made small appearances in several different movies and TV shows (including Heavyweights and Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman).  David Bowe, for once, has a major role in a movie.  However, the entire cast is great.

Something else that makes this movie as good as it is is that ""Weird Al"" has several fantasy sequences, parodying other films.  Name another person who ripped off the opening title sequence for Raiders of the Lost Ark, and think of someone else who could do Rambo like Sylvester Stallone.  The other moments that are hilariously funny are the parodies of movies and TV shows that are supposed to be TV shows from this UHF TV station that this film is about.

The film is about a guy who gets fired from job to job because of his natural tendency of zoning out, who finds himself being the manager of his uncles TV station.  Mainly, this is a great movie, and it's extremely funny.",1250121600,,1999,4.450549450549451

He's actually more like Jim Varney''s ""Vern"" character that was so popular in the '80s: a lame but super nice guy.

That's what ""Weird Al"" plays in here, a Mr. Nice Guy who prevails against forces of evil against him, in this case a TV station owner: Kevin McCarthy, who plays a totally over-the-top villain. Also, Michael Richards was funny as the stupid custodian.

Yankovic will never win any Academy Awards for his acting but he suffices in this no-brainer comedy. Some of the bits are actually quite clever and some are a bit raunchy (hence the PG-13 rating) but there is almost no profanity in here.

340452,4,630156118X,"It's not uncommon for pop stars to get ahead of themselves and decide to make a movie.  The Beatles did it, Prince used to do it and The Spice Girls made a complete mess of it.  But what of Alfred Matthew 'Weird Al' Yankovic and his first and only motion picture?  Any film involving a musician requires caution ('Hearts of Fire', anyone?).  Even its status as a 'one off' suggests failure.  However, 'Weird Al' is not your average pop star and, accordingly, 'UHF' is not a mere star vehicle intended solely to soothe a rampaging ego at the expense of the audience.  It's better than that.  And smarter, too.
First things first.  Weird Al can act.  Not in a Russell Crowe 'watch me disappear' kind of way, or even in a manner that's likely to trouble voting members of the Academy any time soon, but he gets the job done.  Secondly, he's smart enough to share the laughs around.  In particular, Michael Richards in a pre-Kramer role is terrific as the mop-loving Stanley.  And while it would be possible to talk about 'story arcs' and so on, the only true test for a film such as this is whether it makes you laugh.  On this level, 'UHF' is a complete success.
Yankovic clearly relishes the opportunity to work on a bigger comedic canvas and lets his imagination run wild.  Mostly, it works.
I would have been a teenager when I'd last seen it.  Back then, it seemed hilarious.  Because Weird Al rarely relies on that day's newspaper to make a joke, age hasn't wearied it.  'UHF' remains that most rare of movies: one that's genuinely funny and made with a genuine passion for film-making.  It's also criminally overlooked.  Granted, it's not 'The Godfather' or even 'Purple Rain' but that's precisely the point.

Featuring a pre-Seinfeld Michael Richards and a pre-Nanny Fran Drescher, UHF tells the story of a misunderstood man (Yankovic) and his television station, which his uncle won in a poker game.  He proceeds to come up with some creative programs and must stop the giant corporation from shutting them down to destroy the competition.  The best part, however, is the clips of shows that air on UHF Channel 62.  Favorites include ""Wheel of Fish"" and ""Conan the Librarian.""  The fantasy sequences are also very funny.

The movie is rated PG-13 but it's probably appropriate for anyone old enough to understand that no poodles were harmed in the making of this film (watch and you'll understand).  There are no sex jokes and no graphic violence.  Young kids may not get the pop culture references, but anyone can laugh at ""Spatula City"" (just watch the movie!).

George Newman (Yankovic) is a hapless daydreamer who becomes the new manager of a run-down UHF television station. Facing the possibility of bankruptcy, George changes the station's programming with an outrageous lineup of shows like ""Wheel of Fish"" and ""Raul's Wild Kingdom"" and turns the second-rate Channel 62 into the most successful TV station in town. ""UHF"" is an enjoyable comedy that shows off Weird Al Yankovic's brand of humor. Though it failed in theaters, this silly comedy gained a solid fan following upon television airings and home video release. ""UHF"" has some amusing characters and hilarious parodies of music videos, commercials, game shows and blockbuster movies like ""Rambo"", ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The 1989 comedy also stars Michael Richards (Seinfeld), Victoria Jackson (SNL), Fran Drescher (The Nanny) and Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers).

Fans who anxiously waited for ""UHF"" on DVD will be pleasantly surprised with this great DVD release. The 1989 cult comedy is presented in both full screen and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formats. The DVD contains a colorful video transfer and a clear 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. Its most standout special feature is a hilarious audio commentary with Weird Al Yankovic, director and cast.

340489,4,630156118X,"Think Trashy tv..aliens...music videos...and satire of Television, you may think Saturday Night Live or Mad TV...Its not, Its UHF

UHF was done in 1989, long before cable was instilled in us. It was there In th main stream.  Howevert under the Weird Al Yankovic's warped eyes,  this satire poked fun and BAD TV and doesn't date itself.

Also in 1989, the stars of UHF were also semi-nobodies who later made it big in movies and TV. It was Weird Al's first and only starring role. The cast included such performers as Anthony Geary (in-between gigs at General Hospital), B-rated SF film star Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Comic Emo Phillips, Billy Barty, actor John Paragon ( who was the screen writer of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark), Michael Richards (before his turn as Kramer in TV Seinfeld), a pre Nanny Fran Drescher, Gedde Watanabe (16 Candles),  and Saturday Night Live's Victoria Jackson

The satire boarders between silly and slapstick. The jokes come fast and many like in  Naked Gun or Airplane.  It parodies such things like  Rambo, Gandhi, game shows, kiddie TV shows, music videos (with Al's Music for Nothing/jed Clampet music video in the film) and TV Network. It  still seems semi fresh 18 years later

and for those DVD film fans. The DVD audio commentary has Weird Al, Director Jay Levey (who also is Al's manager), Emo Philips, Michael Richards and Victoria Jackson. There is a lot of deleted stuff Al said he had on a VHS tape in his gargage. Foe film fans, its nice

340490,5,630156118X,"Let's face it.  Anyone even looking at buying this movie is very likely either already a Weird Al fan, or looking for a comedy that is not quite... normal.  UHF fits both bills nicely.  Like most of Al's work, it's not a continuous rotfl fest, but it does pack some serious lol action.  But I want to address those who already own an older copy of this movie.

Why buy this DVD version if you've already got the VHS, or Laser Disc (yeah, I'm a LD loser)?  The extra features.  I've seen this movie many times, but listening to Al (and his guests') commentary made it a new experience again.  He either has a remarkable memory or is incredibly anal about keeping track of information, because he knows the story behind every actor, prop and set in the movie.  Mostly funny, but there are also a few touching moments.

I particularly enjoyed his out-takes.  Unlike most DVD deleted footage, he partially narrates his, explaining why scenes got cut, and sometimes fast-forwarding through bits that are too slow.  And the price makes it worth having a copy that's easier to handle than a Laser Disc, or a VHS tape, for that matter.  I'm not a big Easter Egg hunter, so I only tracked down a couple.  Cute stuff, but nothing to write home about.

340497,4,630156118X,"Weird Al Yankovic describes and sings about so many wacky, bizarre scenarios in his songs and videos, that one might think, ""what would he be like in a feature film?""  UHF answers that question, and despite this being his only starring role, Yankovic acquits himself pretty well in this quirky cult film from the 80's.

""Nobody here appreciates someone with a good imagination,"" says Yankovic's character

George Newman, a Walter Mitty-type daydreamer who keeps failing at job after job, much to the frustration of his girlfriend Teri.  So when his Uncle Harvey decides to give him a chance to be the new station manager of the UHF station, Channel 62, George jumps at the chance by putting more live shows.  After all, with his pop culture daydreams, he'd be a shoo-in, right?  As he tells his skeptical friend Bob, ""It's just like working in a fish-market. Except you don't have to clean and gut fish all day.""  Joining him is Pamela Finklestein, a frustrated secretary aspiring to be a reporter.  George, being the nice guy that he is, makes her one, but her first broadcast, an interview with the mayor, is rudely sabotaged.  A remark ""broads don't belong in broadcasting,"" typifies the 80's style sexism.  Also, one has to compete with the national news station, Channel 8, run by the very loathsome R.J. Fletcher, who doesn't have a single nice line in the entire film.

Things start to turn around when he hires janitor Stanley Spadowski, the tall, simple-minded, but eager guy who turns out to be a smashing good entertainer as he is a janitor-his Mop speech is just great.  Because of Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse, the ratings soar and before long Channel 62 is outdoing the national network affiliate Channel 8.  Fletcher is far from pleased and sets out to sabotage Newman.

A lot of the film's funny moments hinges on ideas George has, such as trailers for Town Talk, his Geraldo Rivera type show where he gets whacked with a chair, commercials, or some of the programmes he comes up with-check out the programming schedule.  Goony, Prince Valiant-haired comedian Emo Phillips has a memorable moment as a shop teacher who could be more careful with a buzzsaw.  And how much one enjoys Raul's Wild Kingdom, hosted out of the apartment of a Mexican guy named Raul, depends on one's taste for small dogs.  Oh, and Weird Al makes his notorious twinkie-wiener sandwich, oft-mentioned on Al-TV.

The high note is the opening Raiders of the Lost Ark parody, with an ""idol statue"" scene that's Al's closest to ever getting Best Actor.  The ""Beverly Hillbillies"" video, a spinoff on Dire Straits' computer animated ""Money For Nothing,"" is the other highlight, showing how George does indeed have a good imagination.  And the late 70s/early 80s car commercials with a Cal Worthington type cowboy salesman is embodied in Crazy Ernie:  ""If nobody comes down here and buys a car in the next hour, I'm gonna club this baby seal. That's right. I'm gonna club this seal to make a better deal. You know I'll do it, to, cause I'm crazy.""  Hooboy!

A very young Fran Drescher is pretty hot as Pamela Finklestein, outshining Victoria Jackson (Teri), whose whiny voice is a debit in the film.  Michael Richards steals the show hands down as Stanley.  Kevin McCarthy does Fletcher as that villain one loves to hate, odious, overacting, and with a goofy laugh.  Gedde Watanabe, who made his film debut as Long Duk Dong in Sixteen Candles, plays Kuni, who goes a bit OTT in the Wheel of Fish segment.  ""Stupid!  You're so stupid!"" he yells at a losing contestant.  And veteran midget comedian Billy Barty is sadly underused in this movie, as he only has two scenes as cameraman Noodles MacIntosh.  And catch Dr. Demento as the guy Stanley sprays whip cream on in an ad.

The video for the ""UHF"" song is included as a bonus, as is Al hosting a series of deleted outtakes, which definitely should've been left off the movie, as most were filler that did nothing to advance the movie.

Fans of Weird Al will definitely like this cult classic from the 1980's.  Sight gags, and pain and destruction gags abound.  Some of the material may not be so PC today.

Overall an excellent DVD, however I can't give it a perfect 5 star rating because of what's on side B: deleted scenes and the Pan & Scan version of the film (not the full frame unmatted version from the original VHS release). Al mentions that there are hours of deleted scenes, so why didn't they use the entire side B for them? Nobody asked for the crappy Pan & Scan version of the film. To add insult to injury, two of the deleted scenes are fast forwarded through. Sorry Al, but even if you don't think those two scenes are of any value, your fans think otherwise.",1088640000,,1068,5.233918128654971
340506,5,630156118X,"Okay.  I'll admit it.  UHF is one of my favorite movies.  And I'm not ashamed, either.  After all, it's a product of Weird Al Yankovic, who's famous for his strange parodies of popular songs-like ""Eat It"" or ""Amish Paradise"" or ""Like a Surgeon"" or ""I Love Rocky Road.""  In other words, it's totally wacky and absolutely hilarious.
Weird Al plays George Newman, a guy whose overactive imagination has lost him-and his friend, Bob (David Bowe)-yet another job.  When his uncle wins a nearly bankrupt UHF station (remember UHF?) in a poker game, he gives the studio to George.  Determined to make this job work, George and Bob-with the help of receptionist/reporter Pamela Finklestein (Fran Drescher) and janitor Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards)-create exciting shows that has everyone in town watching.  But when R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy), the head of the local network affiliate, finds out, he decides to do everything in his power to shut George down and turn U-62 into a parking lot.
Words cannot even begin to describe the hilarity of this movie.  On a recent trip, I popped UHF into my laptop's DVD player on the plane, and I was pretty much in tears for the entire hour and a half.  Michael Richards alone makes the movie worth watching (repeatedly).  And while the movie does have a few slow parts, it's necessary-it gives you time to recover before the side-splitting laughter begins once again.  If you're a fan of Michael Richards, off-the-wall comedies, and/or Weird Al, this is a must-see.",1087344000,,1508,4.940476190476191

340508,5,630156118X,"This is a repost of my review from the IMDB site, but since my feelings on the movie haven't changed between then and now, hey.
Many folks find themselves laughing out loud at Al's latest song or video -- at least, the first time they experience it. They might later claim he's stupid or not funny, afraid possibly of being labeled a fan. They might avoid UHF in the belief that it's just an extended Al video.
Their loss.
'UHF' is one of those movies that had a miserable, worthless existence in the theater, shunned by the masses. The recognition of its genius was slow to arrive, but the movie did eventually find cult status on video and cable. The reason, simply: It's hilarious.
Part Naked Gun and part Al video, with plenty of sight gags, this is the kind of movie that only Al could make. ""Wheel Of Fish"" and ""Conan the Librarian"" are funnier than they have any right to be, and just wait until you see ""Raul's Wild Kingdom"".
The cast of 'UHF' seems almost prescient in retrospect; Fran Drescher and Michael Richards made memorable co-stars before they struck gold on network TV. Richards, especially, is hilarious as janitor-turned-TV host Stanley Spadowski. He's brilliant, better than anyone else in the movie and better even than the material he's given.
Although ostensibly a dig at TV, 'UHF' actually lampoons movies and commercials far more effectively, with hilarious send-ups of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Ghandi' and 'Rambo: First Blood Part II'.
But enough. I've already wasted too many words describing a movie that just needs to be seen. If you absolutely hate Al, or 'Airplane'-type movies, then avoid 'UHF'. Anyone else who just wants to laugh (a lot) needs to give it a look.",1084406400,3,1700,4.746621621621622
340509,5,630156118X,"Any Weird Al fan should know what this movie is about, but incase you don't let me tell you. In UHF Al Yankovic plays George Newman a jobless loser whose uncle win a TV station in a game of poker, and puts George in charge of it. The rest of the plot involves George becoming an instant success and trying to save the station.
This may not sound like the greatest plot but it has a ton of hilarious jokes. It kind of reminded me of the same style of comedy as Airplane!
While the movie is funny where this DVD really shines is the special features. Al Yankovic and director Jay Levey provide one of the funniest, most informative commentaries you'll find on any DVD. It also has deleted scenes narrated by Al himself. It has over 200 production stills!

340510,3,630156118X,"I like Weird Al. I've listened to his songs since I was a kid. I remember when UHF came out many years ago and wanting to go see it, but not being able to. Recently, the movie has come up several times in conversations I have had with people. References to ""Wheel of Fish"" and ""Ghandi II"" in UHF were specifically mentioned. So, a few weeks ago I went with a friend on a search to find this movie and watch it.

UHF wasn't anything like I expected it to be. I hate saying this because I like Weird Al, I really do, but there were a lot of parts in the movie that were just painful to watch. Now, I realize that if I was a twelve-year old kid who didn't watch 100 movies a year like I do know, I would probably find UHF to be hilarious. Now, a lot of stuff in the movie isn't funny at all and is just plain dumb. The dialogue is terrible. The sets look like something stolen from an Ed Wood picture and often the lightening messes up the picture.

The movie does, however, have some redeeming qualities. Weird Al does a decent job of acting in the movie, especially considering what type of movie it is. Victoria Jackson has a small role and I still think she's a classy lady to watch. But if you really are looking for a reason to watch UHF, there's only one: Michael Richards (you know, he played Kramer on Seinfeld). In the plot of the movie, Richard's character literally saves the UHF station run by Weird Al's character. However, Michael Richards also saves the movie UHF. There is no movie without him. He is it's true star. This was Richards several years before he found fame playing Kramer and he is just as hilarious here as he was on Seinfeld. In many ways his character in UHF is the proto-Kramer. As bad as other parts of the movie are, UHF is worth watching, if for not any other reason, just for Michael Richards' performance. It's a Grade A comic performance.",1080000000,,1875,4.264044943820225

Written by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, who also takes the role of Newman. Also starring Victoria Jackson, and directed by Jay Levey. The comedy may seem forced, but if you don't like this movie, you have no soul.

The laughs in this movie are cheap and not at all clever.  But there is something to be said about being good at what you do, and in this sense UHF excels at getting you to laugh, and even occasionally regret doing so (such as the blind man playing rubic's cube).  Critics universally panned the movie, which lasted all of two weeks in theaters, but since then it has developed a cult following simply because it delivers on what it's designed to do:  make you laugh.
If you're looking for something to get your mind off of the daily grind, UHF is an ideal escape. I recommend it more for renting than buying, though.
That said, the buyer will find a wealth of rewards in the special features section.  The director's commentary is one of the best I've ever heard, LOADED with information and even cameos by stars like Michael Richards.  Other directors who earn critical acclaim but go on to make the most absurdly boring commentaries could learn a lot from this (read:  Oliver Stone).  Al clearly put a lot into this movie, and his disappointment with its failure, but pride in its resurgence is clearly evident in the attention he pays to revisiting the movie.

340518,3,630156118X,"~80's music and movies always scare me but this movie has a SMALL exception. This movie is about when George Newman, a teenager with no job, (""Weird Al"" Yankovic) gets permission from his uncle Harvey (Stanley Brock) to run a television station with his friend Bob (David Bowe), the really weird janitor Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards), the television reporter wannabe Pamela Finkelstein (Fran Drescher), and a laboratory scientist from another planet named Phllo (Anthony Geary) while trying to avoid another television company owner (Kevin McCarthy) from taking over his company U-62, and turning it in to a parking lot . This movie is what I like to call a ""slapstick movie"" which is a move with nothing but mere jokes and gags. Many of the zany programs on the station that George runs are called ""Wheel of Fish"" (A cross between ""Lets Make a Deal"" and ""Wheel of Fortune""), Raul's Wild Kingdom"", ""Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"", ""Fun with Dirt"", ""Ghandi II"" and ""Strip Solitare"". A lot of these things just don't make sense! This movie is rated PG-13 and has Language, Adult Content, and Rude Remarks.  It's kind of weird but kind of funny in an odd kind of way. Raul's Wild Kingdom was hillarious when Raul (Cliff Stephens) shakes up an ant farm and says ""OHHH! They're really mad now!"" and when he throws a poodle out of a three-story window because he thinks he can teach it to fly. Ghandi II was also quite funny along with ""Conan the Librarian"" and ""Spatula City"".

340521,5,630156118X,"Naturally I enjoy the movie UHF, but I specifically bought the DVD for the bonus features.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that some effort was made to make those features worth the choice in DVD over VHS.
The menus are not static, as they feature the antics of Wierd Al as he walks around, manipulates the menu options with a wave of his hands, and nods at the viewer in approval.
The DVD commentary was perhaps one of the best I've listened to in a DVD movie.  Wierd Al and directory Jay Levey deliver the bulk of the commentary (Wierd Al does most of the talking), with short visits from other cast members.  Michael Richards shows up for a few moments, excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and returns later for a second stint.  Wierd Al appears to call Victoria Jackson over the phone for her input while she's preparing dinner.  Typical Wierd Al.
It is clear that some effort was made to prepare for the commentary in UHF.  Not content to be simply a voice-over, the commentary is produced such that Wierd Al can visibly stand up and walk off-screen for a donut while the movie is playing.  Wierd Al mentions several interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits typical to DVD commentaries, but he also mentions other bits of information which were clearly compiled and scripted for him beforehand.  This keeps the commentary moving, providing the viewer with the maximum amount of information.  He also exhibits an anal attention to detail in that he's able to mention the exact address of the location on which each scene was shot.
Wierd Al apologizes for the poor quality of the deleted scenes on this DVD, as they were taken from a videotape he kept in his closet for the past 13 years, but he makes up for it by personally introducing each deleted scene.  This is another attention to detail that I think is rare in DVD releases of older movies.
All in all, the DVD edition of UHF is definitely worth the money.",1053216000,,1921,4.590643274853801
340522,5,630156118X,"The extras on this DVD as sensational.  If you don't do anything and just watch the menu you'll be entertained by ""Weird Al's"" antics. Deleted scenes found on the flip side aren't that great movie quality wise and you can see why they weren't included buy hey, we all wanted to see them.  You will see some interesting characters that never made the final version.
Behind the scenes footage is pretty funny and interesting at the same time.  You learn that Victoria Jackson who played Terri jumped at the chance to be Al's girlfriend as she had always wanted to play her after hearing Al's classic love song One More Minute. You also learn that Orion thought this would be the film to save them. They were wrong.
There is commentary you can turn on for the entire movie by ""Weird Al"", Victoria Jackson, Michael Richards and Jay Levi.  You'll learn all about how they shot the movie, what other things every actor in the movie has appeared in.  Al talks about how lots of fans claim the David Bowie was in his movie in their reviews and facts like the actor who played Raul (teaching poodle's how to fly) was killed by a drunk driver during filming and was supposed to have more scenes.
Posters is a heap of still shots of the various cover designs and posters that UHF had in different countries such as here in Australia where it was called The Videot from UHF.  The differences between cover designs for each country is quite fascinating.
There are a lot of still shots from the movie or of the actors in the costumes which is worth a look.
Music Video is the UHF song video which has images of Al dressed up as various 80's rock stars together with scenes from the film.  Some of those portrayed are Guns N Roses, Wham, ZZ top and Robert Palmer.  I never even knew this was released as a single and was expecting music video to be Money For Nothing from the movie and was pleasantly surprised.
You can see two trailers for the UHF movie a short one and a longer one.  They're pretty interesting as you probably never saw them or remember them.  It's great to see how the picture was marketed by Orion in those days.
You can also watch the movie with English, French and Spanish subtitles so that you know when you get older and can't hear as well you'll still be able to enjoy this masterpiece.  Also great if learning another language and want to know how to say stuff like, ""So Stupid!"" ""Twinkie Weiner Hotdogs!"" and ""My Mop!"" in French or Spanish.
You never know when you'll need these when travelling.
UHF is the original and still probably the best parody movie of all time.  Although already hugely successful in the music industry with parodies such as Fat, Eat It and Like a Surgeon this 1989 classic was ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's first venture into the world of motion pictures.
UHF thrilled audiences in 1989 as we all sat glued to the screens watching Indian Jones decide that estimating the weight of an oscar with that of sand from the bag in his hand was too hard and eventually being flattened by the huge round boulder as the opening credits rolled.  UHF followed the story of a nerdy young man named George Newman  (""Weird Al"" Yankovic) with too much imagination for everyday mundane jobs who is given the job of running his uncle Marty's local fledgling UHF station that he'd won in a hand of poker.  With the help of his friends (David Bowe), (Fran Drescher from The Nanny), the janitor Stanley Spadowski (Seinfield's Michael Richards) and a few other friends George Newman redevelops the station's shows and takes the struggling UHF station to the top of the television world, even out rating the big free to air networks.
With movies such as Conan the Librarian and Ghandi II No More Passive Resistance channel 62 tops the ratings. TV shows such as Towntalk an early version of Jerry Springer where guests such as the Ku Klux Klan chat with lesbian nuns from outerspace, Wheel of Fish, Raul's Wild Kingdom (see Poodles learning to fly) and Stanley Spadowski's clubhouse the UHF station was destined to become the target of the evil R.J. Fletcher and his major television network. A battle erupts between the two stations and with R. J Fletcher set on turning channel 62 into a parking lot there can only be one winner.
This sensational movie has stood the test of time.  Just watching for a glimpse of all the famous sitcom actors 15 years younger is worth the price tag alone.",1052438400,3,4397,4.553865652724968
340523,4,630156118X,"Will you like this movie? Depends. Here's a scene from the film. If you laugh, you'll like the whole movie. (Personally I REALLY like this kind of stuff. It's dumb and hilarious.):
Near the beginning, Al Yankovic has a dream where he's Indiana Yankovic, and he takes the idol from the altar, after which, like Indian Jones in ""Raiders,"" he's chased by a giant rolling rock.
The rock chases him down the hallway, out of the studio, and into the street in downtown Hollywood. When Al turns a corner to evade the bolder, the bolder turns the corner too, and continues after him.
I laugh every time I see this. (I also laugh uncontrollably every time I see the WB cartoon ""Duck Amuck,"" which has a similar chaos quotient.) If you like slapstick humor like this, then it's worth seeing.
It's also worth seeing for the performance of a pre-Kramer Michael Richards, whose simpleton-janitor-turned-simpleton-kids-show-host character sort of looks like Kramer with a few less IQ points. If that's possible.
Victoria Jackson acts like she can't wait to get to the bank and cash her paycheck, but thankfully she's not in the movie much.
This one's about show parodies, folks, as Al's records are mostly about song parodies. Get it and laugh. It's cheap and funny. Cheap laughs! Hey, I made a funny!

Not the best or most original plot line ever written, but that's like saying you'd buy Weird Al's albums for the artistic value of them. No, you buy them to laugh - and this movie, though slightly dated at this point, is funny. The parodies still make me chuckle, even after all these years. It helps if you're old enough to remember some of the stuff he's parodying, but, I think younger people might get a kick out of it.

THis is one of the few movies that stays funny through out the whole thing and still be a little touching at the same time.  The idea is that George (Weird Al) gets to run a TV station that his Uncle won in a poker game.  George is a very imaginaitve character and for the most part is excited to get this opportunity.  After a few blunders he decides in an act of depression to put the Janitor Stanly (Michael Richards) on the air and the results are astounding for him.  This leads to a bitter rivalry with the local Television station chanel 8 whcih is run by male sexist pigs.  In the end George, Stanly and a host of other comical charcters save the day and get to keep their silly TV shows (COnan the Librarian, Wheel of FIsh)

For everyone who remembers those UHF channels that would run practically any type of show to attract viewers this is priceless entertainment.  Yankovic and Levey devised loads of TV and movie spoofs that begin slowly but soon come at you with machine gun pacing.  There are also several in-joke references to fondly remembered campy television and sci-fi films scattered throughout, such as; the station's chief engineer Philo, played wonderfully by Anthony Geary of 'General Hospital' fame, has a lab that continuously emits the familiar sound of the radar from 'Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea'.  When ""Weird Al"" first meets Philo, he is asked to help Philo test his ""interociter"" - a device used in the 50's sci-fi film 'This Island Earth'.
The shows that the station airs are equal parts amusing and insanely absurd.  ""Wheel Of Fish"", ""The Wonderful World Of Phlegm"", ""Wide, Wide World Of Tractor Pulls"" and the uproarious ""Town Talk"" that takes many welcome pokes at Geraldo Rivera.  Michael Richards (Kramer of television's ""Seinfeld"") creates one of cinema's most memorable eccentric characters as Stanley Spadowski, host of ""Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"", the station's most popular program.  Many of the movie's biggest laughs happen when his program is onscreen.  Other highlights worth mentioning are Emo Philips as an accident prone high school shop teacher; Fran Drescher (of TV's ""The Nanny"") as the station's newscaster; Victoria Jackson, of Saturday Night Live fame, as the long-suffering girlfriend of ""Weird Al""; Gedde Watanabe (of TV's ""E.R."") as the hilarious Kuni.  The most noteworthy cast member though is the veteran actor Kevin McCarthy who hams it supremely as R. J. Fletcher, a rival station owner who is so-o-o-o evil - but you just know he's going to get it in the end!
Yankovic and Levey wisely keep 'UHF' short, clocking in at a little more than ninety minutes, making it an excellent time filler.  It's a movie that you can safely watch with the whole family as well because it is completely free of vulgarity - though there are some gags that might be considered a bit tasteless.  But that's the risk all fans of ""Weird Al"" are willing to take to see and hear his unique brand of humor.
Some final notes: the DVD has several special features including commentary by Yankovic and Levey, with cameo appearances by Emo Philips, Michael Richards and Victoria Jackson.  Also included are some production stills, promotional materials stills, deleted scenes and a music video of the song 'UHF'.  Cult radio personality Dr. Demento can be spotted as a whipped cream eater in a TV spot for the UHF channel - but you'll have to look fast.",1039910400,,3395,4.88

Extras include some deleted scenes with explanations from Weird Al about why they were deleted (egs. ""boring!!!"" and ""this really sucks"") and movie commentary. The menus are quite cute and have Weird Al ""doing things"" (the New Al (TM) - after his laser eye surgury.)

340541,4,630156118X,"""Weird"" Al Yankovic is a popular musician who parodies songs and plays the accordion.  He gained fame and acclaim for his parody of Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"", ""Eat It"".  His videos were heavily played on MTV and Mr. Yankovic had a strong screen presence and it was only natural that he would make the jump to feature films.  His first, and so far only, film is cult favorite UHF.  Mr. Yankovic plays George Newman, who is a big dreamer that can't hold down a steady job.  His uncle wins a small TV station in a poker game and lets George run it.  This is where the film has its best moments.  The station is fodder for shows such as Wheel of Fish and Stanley Spadowski's Playhouse.  The film is essentially made up of little vignettes from the station and they are hilarious.  The film gets bogged down a bit by the script outside the television station, but it is such great fun, you can overlook that.  The film also features a couple of no names at the time, who would go onto big success on television, The Nanny's Fran Drescher and Seinfeld's Michael Richards whose Stanley is a goofy forerunner of Kramer.",1037923200,,1113,4.465346534653466
340542,2,630156118X,"""Weird Al"" is a good-hearted, inoffensive human being. He has one marketable skill (playing the accordion doesn't count) - writing moderately clever song parodies. That's about it.
Unfortunately, his work doesn't come remotely close to the over-the-top genius of Stan Freberg (the greatest pop-culture satirist of the 20th century), the tastelessness of Tom Lehrer, the musical wit of Paul Weston and Jo Stafford, or the imagination of John Forster. Compared to these, ""Weird Al"" is decidedly third-rate.
""UHF"" is supposed to be a satirical stab at television. WA's abilities in this area are as weak as his song-parody skills. With one exception (""Gandhi II - He's back, and this time it's personal!"") nothing rises above the obvious or descends to the tasteless.
""Weird Al"" is afraid to go for the jugular - to find something worth attacking, then ripping it to shreds. Paul Verhoeven isn't. The jabs in ""RoboCop"" are much nastier - and funnier.
The cult status of this film reveals only that its admirers have never seen really good satire - and probably wouldn't recognize if they did.",1037404800,4,1089,5.055555555555555
340543,4,630156118X,"I had not seen UHF in quite a long time.  Remembering that this movie made me laugh hysterically when i was younger, I jumped at the chance to pick up this DVD when i saw it.  Though I had a few doubts that this movie would have lost its magic for me, I felt confident non the less and fearlessly made the purchase. I like a lot of Weird Al's stuff, I think he is much more talented than people give him credit for, and even though this movie got trashed at the box office, it became somewhat of a cult classic, and rightfully so. UHF is a unique combination of spoofs and a zany plot that I really enjoyed.
The cast and characters were quite unique to say the least.  Weird Al held his own, but Michael Richards steals the show. You know him as the wonderful Kraimer from Seinfeld and he really is amazing in his role playing Stanley Spadowski.  The supporting cast keeps the movie light and entertaining and the antics, spoofs and one-liners keep you at least mildly amuzed for most of the picture.  There are a few scenes that were overly corny or dragged out too long, but all is forgiven in my mind once the Rambo scene breaks out.
Overall, UHF is good stuff.  It's a better movie for older people that can appreciate the spoofs on the 80's and its definately not a movie that everyone will enjoy. But if your looking for one of those wacky movies that doesnt always make sence, but is sure to make you laugh, check this one out because ""We Got it all...on UHF!"".",1036281600,,1468,4.281588447653429
340544,3,630156118X,"Sure, Wierd Al has had mega success in Grammy Award-winning parody albums, and MTV Award-winning parody videos, but what about a full-length film? Well, here are a few comments: this is a film venture not just for Al, whose slapstick vignettes and commercial/TV parodies really hit well, but also for Michael Richards, Seinfeldian-to-be.  Richards is spectacular as a downtrodden janitor who saves the cable channel as a wacky kid-show host; bit parter Emo Phillips needed a bigger role to accentuate his bizarre persona, and the flimsy plot takes away from what should have been an episodic film, not unlike Animal House and Fast Times.  Like the latter, this film would've done better without a plot at all. This DVD release only earns a ""3"" not just because of the weak plot, but also because the one I bought had pan-n-scan on one side of the DVD, and allegedly widescreen on the other.  There is no widescreen on my copy, so I'm disappointed. Buy, rent, watch, borrow this film, however, for the great music, great slapstick (remember the clip of Richards aiming a potent fire hose at a young tyke's opened mouth, and the child flying across the set?), and Al's own performance knowing that he's funny and that he's not an actor.  He seemed to move through this film as though saying, in subtitles with an implied smirk, ""Hey -- I know I'm not really an actor, but I'm funny.  And I'm rich enough to do this."" Well done, Al; what's next for you in film?",1036195200,,1458,4.6796875
340545,5,630156118X,"I remember the first time i saw scenes from UHF. I was three at the time and i saw pay-per-view ads for the movie, with the only scene i could remember from it being when Stanley pulls the straw wrapper out of his nose. I got the DVD recently, thinking it would be a cruddy movie, based on what my Dad said about it. Actually, I got a cool comedy treat that everyone should have seen!
The movie centers on George Newman (Weird Al), a daydreamer with a wild imagination which causes him to lose his jobs. His latest fantasy and insult of the boss winds up costing him and his friend and roomate Bob (David Bowe) their jobs at Big Edna's Burger World. While at a going-away party for for his Aunt Esther and Uncle Harvey (Stanley Brock), Harvey winds up winning the deed to a UHF station in a poker game, and George is hired as manager. Along with Bob he meets his co-workers, including receptionist Pam (Fran Drescher), techinican Philo (Anthony Geary), and former Channel 8 worker Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards). When his girlfriend Teri (Vicki Jackson) leaves him after he forgets one too many dates, he is too depressed to continue doing a children's show, and puts Stanley on as a joke. The ratings begin to soar, and George comes up with more ideas like ""Wheel of Fish"" (where the winner gets his or her weight in fish), ""Raul's Wild Kingdom"" (where poodles are taught to fly from third story windows), and ""Secrets of the Universe"" (where we learn to make plutonium from household items). The sudden ratings soar angers Channel 8 boss R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy), who will stop at nothing to shut down Channel 62. Can George find a way to keep the station on-air? What do you think?
The movie was a critical and commerical bomb when released, but it's better than the [stuff] that Ebert thinks is good. Luckily, the movie found a home on Video and Cable TV. The DVD was supposed to be bare bones, until fans stepped in and MGM put a bevy of features on (Too bad they didn't do that for Bill and Ted). Features include deleted scenes with a walktrough by Al, A behind the scenes featurette on the Wheel of Fish scene, commentary by Al with Jay Levey and surprise guests (i want to keep them as surpises), which is hilarious by Al commenting on the MGM logo and singing along with the Orion theme, ""Orion, Orion, is bankrupt now!"", a music video of the song ""UHF"", The teaser and theatrical trailers, easter eggs, production still gallery, Posters and stuff gallery, and menus with Al playing around in each. Overall, this DVD will go to anyone who has a sense of humor, but still pick up the VHS because it is a collector's item.

One either likes Weird Al's sense of humor or one doesn't ... I don't suppose there's a whole lot in between ... I started listening to Weird Al on Dr. Demento, while I worked an overnight shift, back in 1980. Who could forget ""Another One Rides the Bus"" and ""It's Still Billy Joel to Me""? ...
Weird Al fans: you're gonna love it ... anyone expecting high-brow humor ... you're in for one big disappointment ... I love it for what it is ... a campy, goofy spin that only Weird Al Yankovic could create ...

Unless you are a die-hard Weird Al fan who must see UHF, I would suggest listening to the soundtrack opposed to actually watching this film.

340561,4,630156118X,"I didn't think this movie was very funny when i first saw it, and still don't think it is now(except for the skit/parodies).  Michael Richards was borderline 'funny' in a few scenes, outright annoying in most others.  So why 4 stars and a recommendation?  Cause the dvd and Weird Al deserves it.  This is a great dvd that contains extras that really enhances this movie.  The audio commentary is EXTREMELY informative, fun, and even has brief guest commentators(even Mr. Richards).  The deleted scenes is hosted by Weird Al himself and he does a really good job being humorously sarcastic at what is about to be shown.  Throughout the commentary though is where i have a better appreciation for the film.  In the commentary, you find out that due to extreme budget/time limitations, some scenes didn't come off as funny as they could/should/would've.  And that if they had a bigger budget, more emphasis would've went to sketch parodies, which is what Weird Al does best.  Also, there's a good amount of self-deprecating humor concerning how the movie was made and turned out; yet also a sense of pride that it got made and what they were able to accomplish in spite of.  At the very end, Weird Al even shares some harsh critic reviews, then shares his pride for the film and its effect on its fans(and rightfully so).  The speech sounded a little scripted but that's ok.  I'm sure those critics who wrote the harsh reviews spent some extra time thinking and trying to be clever before they wrote what they had to say.  Again, i don't think this is a great comedy let alone best ever, but this dvd really makes me appreciate the movie, Weird Al, and the effort that went into trying to make this a great comedy more.  At such a low price, with enjoyable extras, and some vey funny scenes sprinkled throughout the film, this dvd is highly recommended to those out there that(like me) wasn't so enthusiastic about the film at first.

Though George is full of imagination, he's been forced to suppress his crazy ideas all his life. He starts out running the station the most basic way he knows how, and things are not going well. George and his best friend Bob are desperate for an idea that will save the station. One day, in a fit of depression after being dumped by the girl of his dreams, George hands over his kids' clubhouse show to simple-minded Janitor Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards of Seinfeld). But Stanley's bizarre idea of putting on a kids' show makes their station an instant hit! Suddenly, George is letting all his wildest ideas become reality, from game shows like Wheel of Fish, to action movies like Conan the Librarian, and UHF channel 62 is becoming a total sensation! Everyone is watching, including rival network owner R.J. Fletcher. R.J. is determined to destroy UHF 62 by whatever means necessary, and when Uncle Harvey's gambling debts put him in need of some quick, major cash, R.J. sees the perfect opportunity. The only way George can raise enough money in time to pay Uncle Harvey what he owes before R.J.

But I'd say more than 50% of it is at least chuckle-worthy.
If you're already a Weird Al fan, the main attraction here is Al's audio commentary.  Yeah, the director is there, too- but he barely speaks, and when he does he sounds bored.  Al packs in so much information and very funny anecdotes in this track, I found it easily as enjoyable as watching the movie itself.
Also notable, the 20 minutes of deleted scenes.  This is a bit different than usual deleted sections on DVDs.  Al introduces each of the scenes, giving his editorial viewpoints on each one.  Believe me, Al doesn't consider this film a masterpiece by any means, and his self-deprecating comments makes it even funnier.
A handful of more minor features are included, making this thing a must-own for a Weird Al fan.",1026086400,5,1467,4.432835820895522
340572,5,630156118X,"...In my childhood one of my all time favorites was the failed attempt at a movie he did called UHF. While the film did not loose money it failed to generate any revenue large enough to call it a success, and despite being blasted by critics of the day the movie's real problem was not the movie itself, but the film's release date. It was put out in the middle of one of the biggest summer blockbuster battles of the day. It was up against movies like Batman and When Harry Met Sally and these weren't the only ones! UHF was a small movie releasing against several large movies. It didn't stand a chance and it was crushed.
Thankfully the movie found its way into the hearts of B-movie fans via TV and home video. However, with the demise of Orion in 1996 the video vanished off the face of the earth. Sadly, before I could get a copy of it on VHS.
Over the years demand for the movies return has been running rampant. The movie has a cult following as strong as the following of the other cult B-movie classic ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" This movie is not as quotable as Monty Python's movie, but its just as funny. Literally by popular demand the cult classic is now on DVD with completely restored video and audio that makes the movie look new, deleted scenes that suck to no end, but are worth watching just to hear Al comment about how bad they suck, and a very informative and hilarious audio commentary with Weird Al, his manager, and several of the stars of the movie. This movie is not time sensitive; the gags that were used 13 years ago are still funny today. This film is a must own for everybody. Simply put, quit reading this and go buy this DVD!

I first came in contact with this wonderful film when I was a freshman in high school.  Growing up in a small midwestern town, movies were our life.  When my friends and I discovered UHF in the local Blockbuster, we rented it and never  brought it back.  At last count, we have seen this film over 200 times, and it never loses its savor.  Unfortunately, the video tape has broken, which led me to search for this classic on DVD.

340579,4,630156118X,"...and I mean that in a GOOD way.  It's not a movie you watch for plot, acting or even sex and violence (well, maybe a LITTLE violence).  You watch it for the gags.  And if they make you laugh, the movie is a success.
Al riffs on movies and television the way he does on music.  The gags don't always work.  The opening Indy Jones spoof, while it has it's moments, isn't as funny as I think it could have been.  For the most part, however, they do.  I dare you not to at least crack a smile during a promo for ""Ghandi II"".  I'm willing to bet that if you have a smidgen of a sense of humor, you will be rolling on the floor.  Or ""Wheel of Fish"", hosted by Al's Karate instructor neighbor.  Other highlights include ""Raul's Wild Kingdom"", ""Spatula City"" and Al invoking Stallone for a hilarious ""Rambo"" riff.
Even so, while the gags are great, I'm not sure the movie would have been as funny without an absolutely inspiring comic performance by Michael Richards as Stanley Spadowski.  Michael helps keep this movie afloat by taking a cue from Al and throwing dignity to the wind and having a good time.
UHF is by no means a masterpiece of motion pictures.  What is is is about an hour and a half of good old fashioned laughs, and what more does anyone want for Weird Al?  I, for one, would love to see him take another shot at the movies.
That being said, the special features were pretty cool, too.  There's an extremely short behind the scene feature, trailers, deleted scenes and pictures.  However, the treat is the commentary by Al and Jay Levey.  Al's very informative and Jay seems to be having fun watching the movie.  Watch out for some of the stars of the movie dropping by to add comments.  It's good to see that Michael Richards remembers the good ol' pre-Seinfeld days when he wasn't a star and can drop by for a nice chat.  Another plus is the menu screens with Al creeping around, mugging and whatnot while you figure out which feature to watch first.
Chances are if you're a Weird Al fan, you already know all this and it was part of your DVD library the day of it's release.  But those who aren't as enlightened should pick it up.  Warning, though, if you have no sense of humor, or if your humor is more of the upscale brand, this may not be to your taste...  Ah, heck, give it a shot anyways, you never know!",1024444800,4,2326,4.2988505747126435
340580,5,630156118X,"This ingenious cult classic has sight gags galore !
Very few comedies make me laugh, but this flick, with it's plot of ""down-and-out loser makes good on obscure T.V. station"", gets me howling with gusto non stop.
With a terrific cast, among them the marvelous Kevin McCarthy as the E-vil Mr. Fletcher, Fran Drescher, and Michael Richards, as a looney janitor and ""T.V. star"". He's hilarious, a true clown, and I think highly underrated...and in this film gets to shine.
There are wonderful spoofs of ludicrous T.V. ads (my favorites are ""Spatula City"" and ""Plots R Us""), and shows like ""Conan the Librarian"". Another good turn is Weird Al's rubber-suited Rambo. As an animal rights person, I can live without ""Raul's Wild Kingdom"", but the comic irreverence of ""Gandhi II"" is a priceless piece of buffoonery.

The one feature I really looked forward to, the commentary track, did not disappoint.  From the very beginning, with Al singing his own lyrics to the Orion theme music (""Orion.. Orion..  We're bankrupt.. Now.."")  Al and Jay Levey (but mostly Al) provide a great deal of fun insight as well as some remarkably ""he's got to be reading this"" type info.  But it doesn't stop there.  During the Emo Phillips scene, Al wonders whatever happened to Emo, only to hear Emo himself say ""I'm right behind you,"" which is followed by a brief moment or two with the shop teacher himself.  Michael ""Stanley"" Richards also pops in for some moments of utter hilarity, and you can tell everyone's having a blast, very pleased I'm sure, as are we, that this bad boy is finally on a DVD.

Weird Al scores big here as he does in his music videos, and goes for so many topics in the media, on telivision, still in the music and movies, and it works from the first arm ripped off in the Indiana Jones imitation to the final Gone with the Wind-like kiss from Victoria Jackson.  Big props go to Michael Richards in his true breakthrough performance, and is also one of those comedies that can be quoted over a decade later.

340612,5,630156118X,"This film in underappreciated. I really can't comment on the DVD as it is not out yet, but it looks good so far. I really just wanted to make one simple comment: the film did not bomb because it 'didn't work.' It bombed because it was released at a bad time(if I remember correctly, it went up again Batman and another box-office bestseller which I cannot recall just now). Another aspect is marketing. Just because a film does not do well does not mean it is a bad film; and a film that does great does not a great film make. Monetary success is not a measure of artistic success, and people keep forgetting that. Even critically-acclaimed films like ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""(which even Siskel and Ebert liked) did poorly. Why? Because the company that released it spent no money on advertising whatsoever.
The point is, there are many factor involved in whether a movie is a success or not, the least of which is whether it works as a movie. Its success is usually based on controversy(put a lot of sex and/or violence in and people will generally flock to it), lots of explosions and action or great special effects(if i had a penny for every time I've heard ""The plot [stunk], but if you just want to see good special effects...""), a famous star(""stop bashing that movie! It has Bill Cosby in it, so it must be great"" which I have heard before, believe it or not) or just the media ramming it down your throat.
I digress. View this movie and see for yourself. I can see how some people might not like it; it has little plot admittedly, and the jokes are downright silly. But if you like that kind of thing, this movie is for you. If you like the Airplane! films or anything with Leslie Neilson, if you like Mr. Bean or Monty Python, you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, you might or might not want to give it a shot. Personally, I thought it was a great movie and can't wait for the DVD. In a comedy, to me, plot is secondary to whether or not it makes me laugh. For those of you who want plot in your comedy, check out ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,"" it is really funny and has a decent plot.",1020643200,,2113,4.392857142857143
340613,1,630156118X,"I'm surprised they're bothering to release this film on DVD. This movie is dreadful, and that's coming from a 'Weird Al' fan. The plot isn't worth describing, because the movie is a collage of sketches, most of them juvenile and stupid. Of course, juvenile is what you expect from 'Weird Al', so that's not really the problem. The problem is that 95% of the jokes don't work. That's not just my opinion, that was the general public consensus, as the film bombed and Weird Al's career took some time to recover. There are some attempts to be satirical, but most of them are too broad to have any bite. If your idea of funny is someone getting hacked apart by Conan for turning in a library book late, perhaps this film will appeal, but for me, there was exactly one amusing gag: Spatula City -- a giant warehouse emporium full of spatulas of all sizes and varieties.

340670,5,630156118X,I've seen just about every comedy film ever made. UHF has to be one of the best ever. I actually came to Amazon to buy it but have to leave dissapointed. I saw this movie once when my brother rented it from a video store and I laughed so hard through most of it that I had to rewind several times after wiping away the tears. I hope I can find it somewhere. Have a nice day Scott,977875200,2,379,3.871794871794872
340671,3,630156118X,"I am a serious fan of Weird Al. I've been to concerts,fairs,and met Al himself. But to be honest, the general public might be turned off by the film. The loud characters,oddball lines,and the storyline might be too weird to take. For example, the main character George Newman (Weird Al)lives in a karate studio owned by a loud oriental teacher who screams""STUPID"" almost every one of his lines. Or Stanley Spadowski(Michael Richards)who drives his fellow men crazy from his wild idotic expressions and words. Yet if you liked most Monty Python films this would be worth seeing. But remember just like Al said himself in his Behind the Music,""It's not supposed to be serious, it's just a movie to be goofy.""",977529600,2,706,4.8429752066115705

7812985,3,630156118X,This is a pretty good movie.  Weird Al takes over a UHF t.v. station and through experiments and good luck turns it into the city's number one station.  He parady's everything from Rambo and Indiana Jones.  It's just a good movie.  It helps if you have the right kind of sense of humor.  Which I have always had.,1525737600,,312,4.310344827586207
