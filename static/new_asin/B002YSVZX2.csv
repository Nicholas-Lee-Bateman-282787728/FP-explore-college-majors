4013843,3,B002YSVZX2,"I simply cannot believe that others have praised ""The great camera work...(No artistic flourishes, intrusive fades or flash camera work - but rather good, clear, crisp footage.)""

They must have seen a different DVD from the one I watched.  The camera work is good, the editing is horrendous.  The editor did not allow a scene to ""settle"" for more than 5 seconds, in most cases 2 seconds or less.  The incessant jumping from one camera angle to another is very irritating and robs the concert of any sense of flow and melodic character.  It's as though it was edited by someone with a severe case of ADHD.  For goodness sake, when Roine is cranking out a great lead run, let us SEE it, don't switch over to Neil fiddling with the knobs on his keyboard!

Having said that, the music is quite good and the sound is good, not great.  It is definitely worth owning, but I recommend you leave the monitor dark and simply enjoy the soundtrack - the video track is un-watchable...

4013844,4,B002YSVZX2,"Transatlantic is a great band! the 80 + minute treatment of ""Whirlwind"" is a musical tour-de-force! Absolutely amazing that they can pull this complex matterial off live - and effortlessly! My only issue is with the song set. How many times do we need to hear ""We All Need Some Light"", ""Duel With The Devil"", ""All Of The Above"" and ""Stranger In Your Soul""????? What about some fresh live material? There is an abundance of classic Beard tunes that they can play . Otherwise, a GREAT DVD. Picture quality is great. Sound (no 5.1) , could be better.",1292976000,,547,4.591836734693878
4013845,5,B002YSVZX2,"This dvd set is fantastic. A must have for long time fans, a great introduction to the band if you haven't heard them before. The one thing in this dvd I'm not sure about is Roine Stolt singing lead on ""We all need some light now"". This is a beautiful song and Roine singing it makes it fresh (not a bad thing), but I just love the vocal performance of Neal Morse in this song, which I missed in this version. Other than that, fantastic dvd.",1291852800,,441,4.1395348837209305
4013846,5,B002YSVZX2,"Yes, this is easily the most uplifting, joyful prog rock concert I have had the privilege to watch on DVD. Here are a group of mature, brilliant musicians enjoying what they do in the intimate venue of Shepherd's Bush Empire, London. And the packed crowd laps up every moment that lasts for over three hours. This is no cold, clinical performance but rather a warm evening of smiles of musos and interaction of the crowd.

Neal Morse sings with his usual passion with nods and shouts of encouragement as Mike Portnoy flays away with a flurry of cross sticking. Watching the interaction between Transatlantic is worth the price of DVD alone. Pete Trewavas on fat bass (plus harmony vocals), stands next to the drums, and not only feels the pulse of the bass drum, but throughout the show turns to face Portnoy during intricate passages. Listen to Trewavas's full, rich bass tone particularly on ""All of Above"". Guest, Daniel Gildenlow, sings, fills in our keyboards, jumps and power chords his way adding to the enthusiasm, while Roine Stolt, seems serene on the most intricate guitar riff. The great camera work catches all these interesting glances, action and band spontaneity. (No artistic flourishes, intrusive fades or flash camera work - but rather good, clear, crisp footage.)

The concerts begins with the 78 minute opus 'The Whirlwind"". From soaring melodic guitar lines to full throttle band with organ, keyboards, overdriven guitar and harmony vocals, this contains both light more acoustic sections to dark almost prog metal interludes. Overall this is accessible music with everything from styles of Yes, Kansas to Grateful Dead jamming and Crosby, Stills and Young harmonising by everyone in the band. Although everyone contributes to the composition, Morse seems to have had the biggest influence and certainly the lyrics are his. From the excellent 'interview' and 'Behind the scenes' extras on the second disc, Morse explains how it was Portnoy who saw all the separate compositions and gave musical direction for them to be moulded into one piece. Likewise Portnoy is enthusiastic about the emotion and general message of the Whirlwind and says he doesn't think they are explicit 'Christian' lyrics in his answer to the reporter.

It is worth mentioning that if you are not familiar with the guitaring of Roine Stolt, then you are in for a treat (his singing is also beautifully distinctive). The soaring lead lines are more in keeping with a Gilmour, Livgren or Brian May approach than of the Satriani or Petrucci intensity. Although this is no ways as intense or heavy as a Dream Theater concert, this is still a Portnoy extravaganza as he shouts and conducts the crowd while completing the drum fill with his right hand(you won't be disappointed)! This concert happily seems to go on forever, which for lovers of this music is a good thing. This is simply Epic, with a capital 'E'.

PS: Really like the cool transparent hard plastic packaging of the DVD case. Definitely watch the behind the scenes of the tour as there are great excerpts from most of their concerts including many surprises - look out for what they do and sing on Mike Portnoy's birthday. I'll try not give away too many surprises but from surfing to singing 'Smoke on the water' these guys were having fun!

4013847,5,B002YSVZX2,"I have been looking forward to this DVD for months ... even more as footage from the High Voltage festival started showing up on YouTube. And I was definitely NOT disappointed.

First off, ""The Whirlwind"" Live is absolutely STUNNING ! And the guys played their guts out, running through the close to 80 minutes with barely time to take a breath. Then after a short intermission, they come back with ""All of the Above."" I will say  that I prefer the version on ""Live in Europe"" better, but they still do a phenomenal job. Next up is ""We All Need Some Light"" with Roine doing the lead vocals this time out. A welcome change that did a lot to freshen this up. Finally they close out the set with ""Duel With The Devil"" which is just as fantastic as ever.

Next you need to swap discs for the encore. They start out with ""Bridge Across Forever"" which is just ETHEREAL live. And then they close out with the crowd pleasing ""Stranger in Your Soul."" 6 Songs, 3+ hours of music ... but wait - there's more !!!

I will say that I have only watched a little of the ""Behind the Scenes"" and I haven't seen any of the Interviews - yet ! So I'll hold off on any commentary for now ... which brings us to the final bit of Ear Candy .... ""Return of the Giant Hogweed"" with Steve Hackett from the High Voltage festival. This is every bit as great as you'd expect & watching Steve & Roine trade guitar solos near the end is worth the price of admission.

I will agree with the other reviewer's one criticism that the 5.1 mix was not used as well as it could have. Which really is surprising since Roine did the mix himself. But I'm assuming it was done on purpose, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt & not knock off a star for it. If you're a fan - go buy this disk & make plans to block out 5 hours of time so you can take it all in.",1288569600,8,1822,4.106741573033708
4013848,4,B002YSVZX2,"The picture quality on this dvd is excellent, the music is always good with this supergroup. There's a lot of material here,a 3 hours show, 2 hours behind the scene where we can see Neal Morse and Mike Portnoy played the first role with some good laughs at times. The special treat of this DVD is the extra song in the bonus; ""Return of the Giant Hogweed"" played with no other than Steve Hackett. My only complaint about this double DVD is the 5.1 sound. There's not much sound to create the surround sound. It's often use to hear the crowd, sometimes the sounds of Daniel Gildelow instruments, and the sounds coming in the rear speakers are too low.

It's the best Transatlantic's DVD and a must for the fans of the band and for any prog rock lovers!",1288224000,7,751,4.402877697841727

Both the cameramen & the editor of this dvd also deserve kudos for their work here. It's really well done, & I enjoyed immensely.",1383350400,,417,4.573333333333333
4013852,5,B002YSVZX2,An amazing show you don't want to miss. A friend told me about Transatlantic so I bought the DVD and Im glad I did. I love the band. They are all such great musicians. I would recommend this disc to anyone that appreciates progressive rock.,1375660800,,240,4.355555555555555

4013854,5,B002YSVZX2,"I am almost at a loss for words at this DVD. Before watching this, all I knew of transatlantic was that Mike Portnoy & Neal Morse had this little project. After watching this concert, I am now a huge fan & I'm already purchasing all their albums. Any fan of Dream Theater or Spock's Beard will be very satisfied with this DVD. It opens up with the epic ""The Whirlwind"", a song that spans the length of an entire CD (79:52) & the title (& only) track from the band's third studio album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Whirlwind/dp/B002OB9KPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Whirlwind""</a>, which this tour is supporting. A lot of mood & time signature changes in this lengthy epic story piece. Up next is ""All of the Above"" from their first album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stolt-Morse-Portnoy-Trewavas/dp/B00004RDJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Stolt, Morse, Portnoy, Trewavas""</a>. Another lengthy song, but only clocks in at about 30 minutes (30:18 to be exact). This one is far more upbeat & lively than ""The Whirlwind"" & also manages to tell you a story in the midst of all that is going on all at once. At this point, Portnoy aptly notes ""we've been on stage probably for more than two hours at this point, We've only played two songs so far"" Then Mr. Neal Morse picks up his 12-string acoustic guitar & he & Roine Stolt wow you with more of their beautiful singing & guitar playing in the mellow, largely acoustic, & short (8:39) ""We All Need Some Light"", Then things ramp up again with the lively & also lenghty (28:31) ""Duel With the Devil"" which closes out the disk, but not the concert, which is so long, they need a second disk for the last two songs. Dish two opens up the Encore with ""Bridge Across Forever"", the title track from their second album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-Across-Forever/dp/B00005PJ9V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Bridge Across Forever""</a>&nbsp;& the shortest song in the entire concert (clocks in at a comparably scant 6:02). Although it is short & mostly acoustic, much like ""We All Need Some Light"", it is very beautiful in it's own right. & they close with yet another lengthy epic song, ""Stranger in your Soul"", in which the main highlights are the part where Neal exclaims loudly ""This is the part where everyone goes crazy!!!"" & takes Mike Portnoy's drum kit from him, & he decides to go crowd surfing. Also on this second disk is an excellent behind the scenes interview with the band & documentary & a bonus live track where Mr. Steve Hackett joins Transatlantic to help them cover the Genesis classic ""The Return of the Giant Hogweed"". You get the distinct feeling that a lot of the music is written by mostly Neal Morse, but every member adds their own distinctiveness to each piece. You get a really well-rounded live experience with this, complete with blistering fast playing, good crowd interaction (though not too much) A little added musical flair, alot of good camera angels (though they switch angels way to often & quickly) & a bit of comedy. A great additive to the concert is the way the addition of Daniel Gildenlow to the live lineup fills out the sound. For this reason, I actually prefer this live recording to the studio recordings. Needless to say, this is a must-have Prog rock concert, up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Theater-s-Score-20th-Anniversary-world-tour-with-the-Octavarium-Orchestra/dp/B000GIWS7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Theater's ""Score (20th Anniversary world tour with the Octavarium Orchestra""</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Yessongs/dp/6305076995/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes' 'Yessongs""</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rick-Wakeman-s-The-Six-Wives-of-Henry-VIII-Live-at-Hampton-Court-Palace/dp/B002N5KV5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rick Wakeman's ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII (Live at Hampton Court Palace)""</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nightwish-s-End-of-an-Era/dp/B000PKG7TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nightwish's ""End of an Era""</a>, &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Within-Temptation-s-Black-Symphony-Live-with-the-Melbourne-Symphony-Orchestra/dp/B001CTUI8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Within Temptation's ""Black Symphony (Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra)""</a>.

4013855,3,B002YSVZX2,"Ok, for a moment I don't think of Spock's Beard, Marillion and Flower Kings and  try to analyze strengths and weaknesses of this DVD/CD live, concerning this superband from California...first of all the sound is good, a little be distorted (especially the acoustic parts of the piano by N. Morse, accompanied by his voice, but also some pedal effects, being not always so clear...), but it's well supported by their direct approach and some good, sometimes remarkable, interplays, even though not often different from their style you can regard in their previous experiences along with the bands above...Instead, talking about the video editing and the camera angle, probably the director has not performed his job in the best manner: the camera jumps from an angle to another, trying anyway to take the whole scene on stage with all the members, while the musicians are playing and singing (without forgetting the keyboards) and that's a difficult task!

So, for sure it's not simple to direct such a complex performance, especially if  the band always has to play their most famous tunes (such performance cannot be so different from a jam to another), but their usual highlights ""Duel With The Devil"", ""All Of The Above"" and ""Stranger In Your Soul"" must be witnessed anyway in the best manner.

Unfortunately every new jam is becoming a little bit tiring and quite prolix also in their live version, after a long duration!!  They have been playing these tunes for several times; but this important feature could represent their boring side at the end, if They don't add new fresh music ideas to their retro-prog/melodic metal prog...ok the harmony vocals, the guitar effects by Roine Stolte and his solos together with those ones by N. Morse, are quite in the vein of Yes and the early Genesis, often being well done, but at the end their arrangements are quite dated and their suites perhaps too much long and a bit prolix...even though the unedited live performance with Steve Hackett, regarding the immortal Genesis tune ""The Giant Hogweed"", is a very good performance (the right track for M. Portnoy on drums) and is worth the price of the whole DVD!!

Final note: regardless of the defects inside, you could anyway add another half star at least...but I've been honest in my evaluation, whose score is inferior than the majority of the reviews concerning Transatlantic live, also when I consider the CD audio version...",1303689600,,2427,4.950859950859951

4013857,5,B002YSVZX2,"The Whirlwind By Trans Atlantic - Is An Incredible Experience To Listen To & Watch Live ! If You Like Progressive Rock Done Right- Then This Is The Band ! The Styles Represented On Neal Morse's Awesome Opus ""The Whirlwind"" Cover Most Of The Prog Bands - Such As ,The Moody Blues &  Genesis & Yes & Pink Floyd &  Emerson, Lake & Palmer & Camel & Kansas & Spirit & The Flower Kings & Neal Morse . The Whirlwind Is A 56:00 Minute Opus Divided Into 12 Songs Connecting Various Themes Related To Storms In Life [Both Actual & Personal Storms] Most Of It Written By Neal Morse With Contributions By Roine Stolt [Guitarist Extraordinaire -The Flower Kings] & Pete Trewavas [Bass - [Marillion] & Mike Portnoy Ex Dream Theater Drummer ! This Performance Really Brings Out The Intense Levels These Musicians Play At ! My Favorite Cuts are ""The Wind Blew Them All Away"" & ""On The Prowl"" & ""Is It Really Happening ""[ The Latter Has A Total ""Floyd""  Feel To It. By The Time You Get Through ""The Whirlwind"" [Which Is Only About A Third Of The Entire DVD ] It's So Overwhelming - Then They Launch Into Older Trans Atlantic Classics Like ""All Of The Above"" [From First Album 2001] & ""Duel With The Devil"" [From The 2cnd Album 2003]""Duel"" Is My Favorite Song From Their Older Set List ! I've Become A Huge Fan Of Neal Morse's Style Of Writing & Playing & The Incredible- Flower Kings [From Sweden]. Roine Stolt Is The Top Prog Rock Guitarist Out There Right Now ! He Reminds Me Of [Steve Howe [Yes] & Steve Hackett [Genesis] & Dave Gilmour All Rolled Into One Player - If You can Comprehend That - You'll Get The Picture! I Highly Recommend ""The Whirlwind"" & Other Classics Like Neal Morse's ""Question Mark""[Which Also Had Collaborations From Roine Stolt & Mike Portnoy & Steve Hackett]- Also Neal's ""Testimony"" & ""Sola Scriptura"" & From The Flower Kings - ""Retropolis"" ""Unfold The Future"" ""Space Revolver"" ""Flower Power"" & ""Stardust We Are""- Are Awesome Albums From Musicians Who Ignore ""The Musical Status Quo"" - And Take their Skills To Almost Impossible Levels For Today's Music Scene !

Mike Portnoy puts on a drummers clinic, Pete Tewavas is equally great in his bass playing, and Daniel Gildenlow is really with it with his acoustic guitar. Neal Morse really comes through with his keyboards and Roine Stolt is on top with his guitar (I would have liked more close-ups of his playing).
