This set is a great deal.  I have them all, but purchased them separately years ago when they started producing the DVDs, it was around 20 bucks each, so this is like half-price now.

Fun characters (the bad guys were always the most interesting, particularly Hakkaida) and stories.  Enjoy the nostalgia of the low budget special effects too :)

highly recommended",1480464000,4,456,4.87012987012987

It is a wonderful series that while can be a yad repetitive in certain areas, but it is always engaging and exciting from the first episode all the way until the final episode.

It is a low budget series and it shows with regards to the monster designs, and it's use of recycled action footage here and there, but the characters and plots are very engaging and entertaining, which is the most important element.

Highly recommended!",1480464000,4,575,4.607843137254902
8763483,5,B01GT357XG,"I only recently discovered Toei's 1972 TV series Jinzo Ningen Kikaida after having watched the 2014 movie, Kikaida: The Ultimate Human Robot, a reboot of the '72 series.  Being a '90's kid, I am unfamiliar with all of Toei's tokusatsu content from the 1970's, but am glad I found Jinzo Ningen Kikaida, a well made and entertaining superhero tokusatsu right up there
with other Toei series like Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Metal Hero. If you have never seen Kikaida, you will especially like it if you are a fan of other Showa Era (pre-1989) Toei-made tokusatsu. All in all, it is a series worth watching if you are a fan of Japanese tokusatsu.",1476835200,4,646,4.666666666666667
