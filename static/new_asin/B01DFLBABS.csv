8755860,5,B01DFLBABS,This is a very good film about a remarkable event in India. A lot of the film is shot so realistically it feels like a documentary. We saw it in the theatre and wanted to give the DVD to a friend.,1477785600,,196,3.8048780487804876
8755861,1,B01DFLBABS,"Having actually lived through the Occupation of Kuwait on the 2nd of August, 1990 not to mention that over forty members of my family lived in Kuwait at the time of the invasion I found this movie insulting, it is a mere work of fantasy. The box cover reads ""Based on a True Event"" now while this seems to be a popular marketing ploy these days, in this specific case the only ""True Event"" here is the fact that Iraq did invade Kuwait.

First of all and I am not taking any sides here the looting and killing did not happen during the initial phase of the occupation, the chaos broke out many months after that and escalated in January after desert storm began.

Second of all the movie shows an Indian servant as a high ranking official of the republican guard stationed in Kuwait?! Are you kidding me? You will not find a single person with half a brain who has lived in the Middle-East or is at least familiar with that area who would find this believable.

I am not familiar with the main actor but perhaps he is the Bollywood version of Tom Cruise and has a cult following, perhaps he is a teen Idol, the movie seems to be focused around glorifying him.

The occupation of Kuwait was truly one of the most devastating events to occur in Middle-East history this century, I found it incredibly painful to watch this completely unrealistic hideous portrayal of that event

I am just glad this movie was streaming on Netflix, I can't imagine ever paying for this, definitely one of the worst movies I have seen this year.",1472428800,3,1523,4.444444444444445
8755862,5,B01DFLBABS,"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Not being Indian, the movie gives a very unique view of people who have largely been minimized in contemporary Western cultures. As a Marine I learned many lessons during my Vet Nam era service, humility and human respect were among the most life changing. Although not as dark as Hotel Rwanda the point is driven home in this movie, that all human life must be respected with dignity and an awareness that people in all countries love their children, their families, their security as much as every American I have ever met.
Forget the early dancing scene and the differences between Indian and American film making, you will enjoy the movie!",1471910400,4,691,4.672131147540983
