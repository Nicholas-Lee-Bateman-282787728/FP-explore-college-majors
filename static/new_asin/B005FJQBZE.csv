4681486,5,B005FJQBZE,Esta novela est bruta - buensima.      Est pesada en el sentido que dice como se mueven las drogas y como se traicionan todo por dinero.  Mucha cochinada.  Esta novela est llena de educacin.,1329696000,,190,4.575757575757576
4681487,5,B005FJQBZE,"Son pocas las palabras que pueden describir esta obra de arte en actuaciones, ambientaci&oacute;n, escenarios y sobre la historia le&iacute; el libro y ahora que vi la serie esta llevada a la pantalla de una manera extraordinaria, Kate del Castillo te cautivara, pero la participaci&oacute;n de la espa&ntilde;ola Cristina Urgel se lleva obra, fant&aacute;stica, debes no solo verla, tenerla.",1325289600,5,392,5.661016949152542
4681488,5,B005FJQBZE,"It is the only novela of which I'm aware that is released on DVD having all, full, uncut episodes. And, for 63 episodes, it is packaged at a very affordable price! Even American TV seasons, with an average of 22 episodes, or HBO seasons, with an average of 12 episodes, cannot come close to the price of this most-watched and award-winning novela. It comes with the original music (and video) as well as a ""greatest moments"" extra that was also broadcast during the novela's US run.

Yes, there are no subtitles. And it would really have been nice to have at least an English and a Spanish set. However, I think this was a cost trade-off. Besides, most of us 'novela watchers' either already know or have learned the Spanish language, right?

These episodes are as they were broadcast and that means that some of them start with a reprise of previous highlighted events. Also, there is the constant insertion of the song/title screen at every point where the show came back from a commercial. In a DVD set, I would prefer that this 'extraneous' material be gone so that I could watch the novela more fluidly as a 'movie'. Again, this is not that important. And, if one were to watch an episode per night, there is something to be said about keeping integrity of the novela experience as it was originally broadcast. It's a judgement and a cost call and I really can't say which way is better. Perhaps if this DVD succeeds in sales, leading the way to future novela releases, that there will be an option to turn off the previous event highlights and commercial-return segments for those who want a more fluid view of the novela.

In my opinion, this is a really great set of DVDs and a wonderful novela.",1323388800,2,1703,4.5588235294117645
4681489,5,B005FJQBZE,Wonderful novel I did not wanted to end. If you like action and adventure you need to have this more than great DVD. One of the kind.,1322870400,10,133,3.962962962962963
4681490,5,B005FJQBZE,"Just Finished watching the entire series.
This is an addicting Novela to watch, very good.
At first I was not to interested just because I do not like Kate Del castillo as an actress, in my opinion a different Mexicana actress should have been given this role. some one with more attitude and nice looking. For example Gloria Trevi, Victoria Ruffo.
Most of the Novela takes place in Spain, nice beaches and  Lots of action.
You will not be dissapointed and it will be hard to stop watching.

Next one to watch is ""La Reina Del pacifico.",1322784000,,536,4.515463917525773
4681491,5,B005FJQBZE,"La Reina del Sur was one of the most exciting, fast paced and tightly plotted telenovelas ever aired.  It has great acting, led of course by Kate del Castillo in the title role.  There are no subtitles, and it's in Spanish, so you have to be fairly fluent to understand what's going on.  The story is gripping, tracing the unexpected rise, fall and rebirth of a woman who never asked to be, but somehow turned out to be, a very powerful figure in the international drug trade.  Even though she's a ""criminal"", the viewer has a lot of sympathy for her, as she has a strong internal moral code, and cares deeply about her friends.  The original series ran 63 episodes, and all 63 are included in full on Volumes 1 and 2 (6 discs each).  The picture and sound are clear, and I'm really enjoying every minute, even though I saw it originally on TV.",1322179200,35,844,4.378205128205129

4681525,1,B005FJQBZE,"While it is the complete novella and it is well made, the story is trash and the characters are pretty much trash and the Spanish is not the best.  Other novellas I have have watched present a variety of Hispanoamericans tipos, language variety in relationship to class and education, and wit.  This is just violence and revenge by one group of hoodlums out to get another group of like minded thugs.  Glorification of the Mexican drug thugs is about it.  Pasion de Gavilanes, El Cuerpo de Deseo, Dona Barbara, these are top rated novellas that La Reina del Sur can't touch.  te-lenovelas.com has them, and many others, in their entirety, without subtitles and they're worth the price.",1404432000,,685,4.82051282051282

4681539,5,B005FJQBZE,"I love the novela.  The only probem is that the DVD version was not edited, therefore the start of the novela shows (all the corrido) on each episode as well as after each commercial (or what would have been).
