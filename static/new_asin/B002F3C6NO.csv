3920775,5,B002F3C6NO,"Though I had never seen this film, based on the 5-star reviews here and on my deeply-held conviction that Dame Maggie Smith can do no wrong, I went ahead and ordered it.  Having now seen it, I'm so glad I did--it is a magnificent film.  Hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time, it reminded me of the emotions a REAL love story can bring about.  Also, I must mention that the musical score is absolutely gorgeous, one of the most beautiful, wistful film scores I've ever had the pleasure to listen to!
I will watch this many times in the future, and for anyone on the fence about buying this, don't be, it's an amazing and wonderful experience.  You won't be sorry.",1252972800,27,669,4.459016393442623
3920776,5,B002F3C6NO,I have ben waiting many years for this classic film to emerge onto dvd. It left an indelible mark on me when I saw it on ite original release. Currently I have to endure a poor quality dvd which I  recorded off TV  years ago. This is a bitter sweet romantic story  about a young  guy who meets up with a much older  woman on a journey through Spain  which will change their lives forever. The casting of Bottoms and Smith is perfect and the direction is  superb. Once seen never forgotten.,1249430400,4,489,4.25
3920777,5,B002F3C6NO,"This is the best Maggie Smith movie ever made.
I loved this movie it was very funny and touching at the same
time.
I don't understand why it took so long to come out on DVD
but anyone who has not seen it must, they will love it.",1248393600,3,228,3.7708333333333335
3920778,5,B002F3C6NO,"I fell in love with this movie decades ago and it is one of my all-time favourites. It's a hilarious but very tender love story involving an awkward young American man and a sad, repressed, middle-aged Englishwoman travelling in sunny Spain. They blossom in each other's company and bravely reject convention in order to find happiness together. It's beautifully filmed, as close to a perfect film as I've seen. I'm so happy it will be released on DVD--now I can retire my old VHS copy. Do yourself a favour and buy this movie!",1248134400,12,527,4.67741935483871
3920779,5,B002F3C6NO,"A big favorite from the early 70's, directed by Alan J. Pakula.  It has been a very long wait for this film to finally make a DVD appearance.  Maggie Smith and Timothy Bottoms, two ""odd ducks"", manage to discover each other in romantic Spain during their summer vacations.  This discovery leads them through hilarious adventures, with all sorts of eccentric characters against a backdrop of stunning scenery and soaring romantic music. At the time of the original movie release, it quickly became a quiet cult favorite, with fans returning to the theaters for multiple viewings.  It has been the only film of the late director Alan J. Pakula that was unavailable on DVD, and we are very glad to see after over 30 years, we will once again have the pleasure!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",1247875200,43,791,4.744525547445256
3920780,5,B002F3C6NO,Hey movie collectors...this movie has been finally released!!!  It has been a long wait but well worth the waiting.  Excellent acting from Timothy Bottoms and Maggie Smith.

3920786,5,B002F3C6NO,"Maggie Smith at her priggish best.  Timothy Bottoms excels as the sensitive, bored, spoiled rich kid. The chemistry between these two is amazing and the settings in Spain are wonderful.  Pleasant love story with superb acting.",1408233600,,226,5.25

3920791,5,B002F3C6NO,I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters.  I have been looking for it for years and could not find it.  I am really glad they finally came out with the DVD.  I got to enjoy it all over again like it was a new movie because it had been so long.  Just a really cute romance.,1392595200,,281,3.6333333333333333
3920792,2,B002F3C6NO,"Nothing bad to say about the disc itself or the packaging.  Even the production values are fine.  We're very familiar with Spain during this time period.  But I've never seen a movie where every single character is annoying and selfish.  Every movie needs a hero, even a flawed one.  The only one I could find in this movie was the donkey.",1390521600,,339,4.491803278688525
3920793,5,B002F3C6NO,"I first saw this film nearly thirty years ago and loved it then. Correction. I saw the second part of it - on television, and never knew what it was called until some years ago. I had it purchased for me this Christmas as an unexpected present. It is as I remember it; an absolute gem, which deserves to be much better known than it is. With superb performances from Maggie Smith and Timothy Bottoms, a haunting main theme, and some beautiful shots of Spain as it was, before mass tourism, it is a slowly paced, bitter sweet, romance; a much, much better film than the over hyped ""Love Story"". Excellent.",1389312000,,604,4.45045045045045
3920794,5,B002F3C6NO,"I have never heard of the male actor but am familiar with most of Maggie Smith's movies.  I ordered the movie after I watched it one evening on TV.  I fell in love with the actors and the love story.  I have shared it with several of my friends, I never get tired watching it.",1381190400,,276,3.981818181818182
3920795,4,B002F3C6NO,Has all the hallmarks of a particular genre about mismatched couples and makes it work. Sentimental? Of course. But what is wrong about another silly love film (with apologies to Paul McCartney).,1380672000,,195,5.125

3920797,5,B002F3C6NO,"I ENJOYED THE STORY, IT WAS SO DIFFERENT AND THE STORY LINE UNEXPECTED.  I LOVE TIMOTHY BOTTOMS AND HAVE GOTTEN;A LOTOF HIS TAPES.  IT WAS GREAT TO SEE MAGGIE SMITH I USUALLY SEE HER IN  A SERIOUS STORY

3920798,2,B002F3C6NO,"Clumsy, strained, way-too-long attempt at winsomeness that never really works.  You can tell a film is in trouble when it starts turning into a travelogue full of weathered Spanish peasant faces that have nothing to do with the story.  Maggie Smith can almost make even this drivel good, but Timothy Bottoms' attempt at youthful angst comes off as simplemindedness and his big speeches are so poorly read that you understand why his career tanked almost as soon as it got going.  And Maggie Smith is dying of a never-explained movie-disease that periodically makes her seem to be having a stroke ... but with no residual effects.  Sentimental nonsense with pretty scenery.",1373846400,,672,5.027027027027027
3920799,3,B002F3C6NO,Someone said that they could watch Maggie Smith peal an apple. While they should provide the apple with this one. It is a very simple plot so don't expect a lot of character depth. Couldn't get all the way through it the first time.,1369785600,,232,4.295454545454546
3920800,5,B002F3C6NO,Wonderful movie. A beautiful story...beautifully told.  Superb acting by Maggie Smith and Timothy Bottoms.  Scenic locations and an evocative musical theme.,1368057600,,156,6.380952380952381
3920801,5,B002F3C6NO,"If you like Maggie Smith, you will definitely want this movie for your home collection. The story line is touching with moments of humor. Above all, the scenery is spectacular as the movie was filmed throughout regions in Spain. With romance, humor, airmchair travel, and drama, how could this not be a great movie?",1367366400,,315,4.851851851851852
3920802,5,B002F3C6NO,"Funny, touching, beautiful scenery in Spain. The young Maggie Smith was fabulous as always and Timothy Bottoms did a fine job. It's a movie that holds up to repeated viewing.",1363737600,,174,4.833333333333333
3920803,5,B002F3C6NO,"Fell in love with this movie when I saw it for the first time in the 70s.  I was so happy to finally get a copy of it.  It's a great May-December romance between a middle-aged spinster and a square-peg but sweet young man.  Lots of laughs, and some sadness.  Set in Spain, so there are some nice travelogue scenes, too.  I could have skipped the whole section with the duke and his castle, but liked the rest.  Great ending.",1359158400,,424,4.2375
3920804,4,B002F3C6NO,Not many people know about this movie...too bad for them. It was extremely funny with a great story line. I recommend it!,1355356800,,121,4.545454545454546
3920805,5,B002F3C6NO,"I saw this movie when I was 18 or 19 with my boyfriend, but as the years passed, I could not remember the details.  All I could remember was ""Love, Pain"" but couldn't remember the rest of title.  Then I saw the movie on American Movie Classic (AMC) and I was thrilled when Amazon had it on DVD.

It's a great, off beat, romantic movie, filmed on location in Spain.  Maggie Smith is so wonderful and Tim Bottoms is so cute",1354233600,,421,4.160493827160494
3920806,5,B002F3C6NO,"Don't you just love movies that are so beautifully photographed, directed and acted that you can just relax, sit back and ""watch them do it"". No violence, no horrible people, no sad ending - just a lovely unusual story beautifully presented.  I've never seen a relationship portrayed as beautifully as this one is. Maggie Smith is just so amazing to watch and Timothy Bottoms is perfect in this role. Such wonderful faces and expressions on both of them.  Some of it is hysterically funny and some of it is so tender that you just want to weep. I happened to catch part of this movie on a movie channel a few weeks ago and wanted to see all of it so I ordered it from, of course, Amazon. Just loved it and will watch it many times I'm sure. I loaned it to a friend who said she thought it was slow and just o.k. so I guess it may be a matter of taste. But, it is exactly to my taste. Thanks Amazon for making it available.",1315526400,2,922,4.174157303370786
3920807,5,B002F3C6NO,"Maggie's balance of fall down slapstick comedy and heartbreaking honesty is unmatched anywhere. Sit back and watch a master work her magic. This is a wonderful film, way before it's time. I am so grateful it's been rescued from oblivion.",1298937600,5,237,4.95
3920808,5,B002F3C6NO,"Loved the movie, saw it when first released thirty years ago and have been looking for it for last few years. Still one of my favorite movies that has not dated with age.",1295740800,,170,4.181818181818182
3920809,5,B002F3C6NO,"this story so sensitively written for screen,directed  and produced by Allan Pukula has the most beautiful photography  and musical score and performed by 2 of the most  talented actors was a joy to view. The magnificent Maggie Smith gives her character warmth and sympathy and the talented Timothy Bottoms creates his role as the young insecure man so well. When the 2 meet by so natural events in their circumstence their story plays out with humor,compassion and love. I was so engrossed in it I had to give it 5 stars. Try and view it as it will stay with you.",1286841600,2,564,4.564356435643564
3920810,5,B002F3C6NO,"I am a belated new member to the Maggie Smith fan club. Long before she became the esteemed Prof. McGonagall in Harry Potter, I liked her immensely in Gosford Park, Tea with Mussolini and Ladies in Lavender.

So it became a mission of sorts for me to acquire DVDs of her earlier work simply because I knew there is more to Dame Maggie than just being a ""spunky old lady"".

""Love, Pain and the Whole Damn Thing"" is one of those movies can be described as a guilty pleasure. Oh definitely not because of the plot - which is the usual guy-meets-girl, guy falls in love with girl, girl dies *thud*. In between this predictable story line were two strangers, poles apart, but both seeking the same thing. So who cares if she's a middle-aged spinster who attracts the weird types and he's awkward college-aged young man who is gawky and wimpy (Timothy Bottoms' character here reminds me of Michael Cera's roles these days)? More than just embarking on a February-December affair, the journey of these two people was paved with good, lustful yet memorable intentions.

I cannot believe how young Dame Maggie was here. So much that when I found a post somewhere on Tumblr from someone who had seen ""Gosford Park"" and asked if Maggie had ever been young, I hunted for a YouTube clip of this movie (with the awkward bed/falling on the floor scene) and sent it to that poor thing.

Most reviews here have commented on the wonderful Spain setting and I have to agree. I think each place they visited was symbolic, but notably the last, La Mancha, representing what seems to be such a foolhardy relationship - it was doomed from the start or so it seems.

I loved this movie and only wish that it came with special features (I live for them).",1282176000,10,1729,4.546623794212219
3920811,5,B002F3C6NO,"I first saw this film when I was a little kid, and what stuck in my mind the most was the Spanish countryside.  If there's a 3rd character in this film, it's Spain.  Interesting enough, no national landmarks (except for the windmills) were included in the film, just Spain and it's sprawling hills and rather drab rural folks.  OK, this was released in 1973 and Franco was still alive, but I thought the caricature of Spanish macho men (greasy hair and all descendants of Don Juan) was quite insulting.  But it's 1973.

What made this film so awesome were Dame Maggie Smith and a young Timothy Bottoms (before he aged into GW Bush's doppelganger).  For some reason, they simply made it work.  And the music - absolutely gorgeous - like the Concierto de Aranjuez's little, less developed baby brother.

This one is a keeper.  37 years later, it is still a keeper.",1280102400,,862,4.618421052631579
3920812,4,B002F3C6NO,"If you are in the mood for a highly romantic,
unlikely but soulful and comic romance, this is a great choice.
This is not a flawless movie but the cinematography of Spain
and Michael Small's classical guitar score are gorgeous.
 As Maggie Smith's co-star, Timothy Bottoms is
the weakest link but she, as always.
manages to find  humor in her very conflicted character as a
spinster with a terminal illness.",1279756800,,406,4.785714285714286
3920813,5,B002F3C6NO,"The GREAT Maggie Smith is excellent and so is Timothy Bottoms plus the rest of the cast! A school marmish Lila is touring
through Spain and encounters a few men that are attracted to her, plus a confused young man that may or may not win her
heart.
There is humor,pathos, romance, the Spanish country side, and everything works in this film.
A lady friend of mine had already seen the film across the bay where she lived and wanted me to see the movie with her
on the San Francisco side where I live. It's the only time she ever visited me in my City, she was really visiting the Movie, but I did't mind. That night, we saw a great, wonderful film.
The film will be with my other so-called Chick Flicks;""Summertime"",""Roman Holiday"",""Best of everything"",""Return to me"" etc.",1270080000,2,772,4.521428571428571
3920814,4,B002F3C6NO,"Here's a lovely gem from the early 1970s, a story of love & human connection that goes its own awkward, endearing way. I expected a terrific performance from Maggie Smith, and she delivers one that's quietly stunning in its tics, hilarity, and poignancy. But I was pleasantly surprised by just how good Timothy Bottoms is, playing a young man who's so uncomfortable, so lonely & unable to fit in, that we squirm uncomfortably with him.

When these two unlikely lovers meet & slowly, clumsily begin to blossom, it never feels formulaic. I was never quite sure where the story would lead next, which made it all the more enjoyable & fresh. And when a certain revelation is made towards the end, it throws all that's gone before into an entirely new light. A second viewing is a very different experience!

It's no secret that current romantic comedies are dreadful, for the most part. If you're looking for something much better, something with genuine humanity, humor & almost painful tenderness, you won't do better than to spend a couple of delightful, aching hours with Walter & Lila. Add to that the landscape of Spain, drenched in sunlight & history, and you can't go wrong. Highly recommended!",1265587200,4,1198,4.839024390243902
3920815,5,B002F3C6NO,"Since I first saw this film back in the early 70's it has been my all-time favorite film.  For many years it was unavailable on tape or DVD for reasons unknown to me,  however,  we are fortunate that it's finally been released to the public again.  The gorgeous Spanish scenery and the lush musical score alone is worth a viewing.  But the dry comedic talents of both Timothy Bottoms and Maggie Smith are delightful.  The film epitomizes all the elements in the development of a love affair between two very mis-matched misfits.  Maggie Smith's scene in an out-house at a Spanish rest stop is hilarious!",1265414400,,603,4.685714285714286

3920817,5,B002F3C6NO,"I actually bought this for my friend who has been telling me about it for some time. We both thought it would never be available so when I saw it at Amazon, I immediately bought it. She graciously allowed me to watch it first and having never seen it before I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is quirky and bitter sweet with the mismatched couple played by Timothy Bottoms and Maggie Smith. He is a very shy insecure odd one out young man whose father wants him to be someone he isn't and never will be. She is an older woman, a spinster who has an affliction and is jittery and fussy, the sort of character Maggie is so adept at playing.  They meet on a Bus Trip around Spain and although irritated by each other at first, they become fond of each other, eventually it turns into love. Some quite funny and strange things happen to them along the way and we find out that she has a serious illness. He obtains a funny little car and a caravan which has seen better days It leaks very badly and has a door they have lots of trouble opening and closing. They leave the Bus Tour and set off on their own. She feels she should end their relationship because of her illness and age difference so he goes back to his home in America. I feel I shouldn't say anymore as it would spoil the ending, but I would say to anyone who likes unusual romantic films which are funny but poignant that they can't go wrong with this one.",1260489600,2,1411,4.222222222222222

I have never been able to forget it. I had a recorded-from-TV copy and every so often I have watched it, despite the poor quality of the VHS tape. To have such a DVD is a joy.

Others have descibed the plot and the music and the scenery and all are top notch.

3920819,4,B002F3C6NO,"I really enjoyed this film, but it wasn't the revelation that others have built it up to be.  Overall it is a warm and touching  portrait of two people in transition.  Bottoms and Smith are quite good together. It seems a bit dated at times- but 1972 was a long time ago- cinematically speaking.  If you are a Smith fan, you should see this film. Fans of Smith's later film work (Keeping Mum, Potter films) will be surprised at her youth and vibrant appearance.  Bottoms's peformance is especially touching.",1256515200,,507,4.651685393258427

HOWEVER THE FILM IS MADE TRULY MEMORABLE OF COURSE BY THE MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES OF MAGGIE SMITH AND TIMOTHY BOTTOMS. THEIR UNLIKELY ROMANCE IS MADE TOTALLY BELIEVABLE BY THEIR TREMENDOUS CONNECTION.

Maggie Smith was as always absolutely great. The scenery was outstanding. I enjoyed the scenery very much. The Spanish atmosphere engulfed me. I loved the music and when Maggie danced, I thought that was great. The duke was funny and the little trailer reminded me a little bit of the old Desi and Lucy movie, The Long Long Trailer especially when it was raining and Timothy falling in the mud was comic.

Both characters are quirky and eccentric and loveable.  In my opinion, Dame Maggie Smith, with her keen wit and understated tone, infuses the plot with a subtle humor that is truly memorable.  Can Spanish wine, dance, and music change us all from caterpillars into butterflies? You might think so after watching this lovely movie.",1427846400,,478,5.076923076923077
