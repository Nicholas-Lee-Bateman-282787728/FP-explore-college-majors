7905532,4,B000009MSO,"After sitting at home watching a group of so-so DVDs I bought on a trip from China, I popped in this one and what followed was a breath of fresh air.  This is really an all around pleasant comedy set in Hong Kong in the late-1980's. The movie begins with the meeting of an overweight man and woman who cannot hold jobs. The story continues with their antics at thier first job together at a department store and culminates into there last job together working as security guards at a building.  This is a great movie on family dynamics, where the man brings the woman to her house to meet his mother and the woman brings the man home to meet her whole family of unique people.  The man instantly hits it off with the woman's cranky and retired father to the surprise of the whole family. There is a hysterical scene where the man convinces the father not to criticize the family at the dinner table anymore, but in doing so the father cannot eat anymore.  The man moves the father in front of a mirror and has the father criticize himself.  Silently, the father points his chopsticks at himself in the mirror, makes some funny faces and is finally able to chow down. The movie is loaded with well-realized characters; a bomb squad, men-dressed-as-woman robbers, the Taiwanese mafia, a Tom Cruise wannabe brother, an evil manager, a suck-up assistant manager and a beautiful younger sister.  For foreign movie buffs, this is a unique movie where the humor translates quite well.  For language buffs, Manadarin, English and Taiwanese is spoken.",1204416000,,1542,4.667896678966789
