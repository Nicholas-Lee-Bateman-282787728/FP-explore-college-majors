8540804,5,B009EZNFXG,"Eye candy for the Arabian horse lover... presented from a different viewpoint, that of the desert bedouin and more modern Arab (Saudi in particular). Plenty of action and motion and (wonder of wonders) not done in sloooooow motion like so many western videos. Would have loved more identifications of the horses used, but those were not needed to make this a visual and informational success. I hope there will be more in the same vein.",1395705600,3,436,4.826666666666667

8540807,5,B009EZNFXG,"WHAT A GREAT DVD THIS IS!
The history of the Arabian horse....names that I remember from the time I researched the Arabian Horse before I purchased the ""best horse I ever owned!""  I purchased my Arabian Raffsein at 3 months old, and had him until he was 34 years old!  Names in the video such as Homer Davenport, and Judith Forbis brought to mind when these horses were brought to the US from overseas! Current interviews with Arabian peoples made this film even better.  I will have some friends over to view this DVD again...one viewing is simply enough!  I loved it!",1361491200,4,569,4.549019607843137

8540809,5,B009EZNFXG,I thought I knew everything about horses but this DVD on the Arabian gave me some new information.  I've always had quarter horses and seen my share of Arabians but I never knew that the Arabian gave so much to the horse world.,1356739200,7,227,4.27906976744186
