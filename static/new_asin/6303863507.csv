7854804,3,6303863507,"Robert Patrick and Peter Weller (especially the latter) elevate this otherwise completely routine straight to video action flick about two mercenaries who are hired to protect and hide a shady billionaire's daughter for a few days while he completes a business deal.  The billionaire is definitely not a good guy--the primary villain is a former employee who was cheated on a deal.  Robert Patrick only does the job because he feels like he owes a debt to the billionaire who is calling in that marker.  Peter Weller despises the billionaire (with very good reason it turns out) but goes along to help his buddy and because he smells a set-up.

There's definitely a lot of action but unfortunately, quantity doesn't equal quality--for all the shooting and explosions nothing is well staged or exciting.  It's all pretty much just a lot of motion and noise.  Charlotte Lewis, who never really had the talent to rise above the level of eye candy in films plays one of the heavies adequately.  I didn't recognize anybody else in the cast but everyone is perfectly competent, although I wished for a stronger actress than Darlene Vogel to play the woman Robert Patrick and Peter Weller are supposed to protect.  She's competent like the rest but since she's more or less a third lead and we are actually supposed to care about her fate competent isn't really good enough.  Vogel is pretty but not especially engaging or likable.

Decoy would hardly be watchable at all without Robert Patrick and Peter Weller, but both actors have enough screen presence and talent to keep this forgettable film just slightly above the level of completely disposable junk.",1499644800,,1651,4.906474820143885

7854808,5,6303863507,"Peter Weller (Robocop) and Robert Patrick (Terminator 2) are a perfect match in ""Decoy"". Weller is a recluse and Patrick on the edge of destruction when they are hired to protect the daughter of their commanding officer. The two highly skilled, ex-intellegence opertives pull out all the stops with surprises along the way.  This is a great action movie and worth your time.  If you like seeing Robert Patrick's early work, it's a must have.",1005782400,2,441,4.866666666666666
