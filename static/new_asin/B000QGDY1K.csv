2838065,5,B000QGDY1K,An interesting collection of the steam railroading side of the industry which will be a great addition to a railfan or railroaders collection.,1303862400,,142,5.217391304347826
2838066,5,B000QGDY1K,"I purchased this DVD based on a number of favorable reviews it received.  It's a little slow getting started at the first.  As a matter of fact, most viewers can probably skip the first segment entirely to get to the meat of the history of steam.  The DVD shows scores of engines and briefly mentions the origins of many, which makes for a more interesting view of the subject matter.  Much more of the footage than I would have expected is in color and I really enjoyed that facet of the presentation.  Being several hours in length, some viewers may want to break up their viewing into segments.  I watched the DVD all the way through and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Highly recommended.",1301875200,2,696,4.609756097560975
2838067,5,B000QGDY1K,Great DVD for steam train lovers.  Lots of different type of steam engines and very interesting.,1258329600,,96,5.0
2838068,5,B000QGDY1K,"This is on of the most informative videos (DVD) I have ever seen
on the history of railroads especially The American steam locomotive.
If your going to buy any video on railroads or locomotives from the
1940's to the 1970's then this is the one.

2838071,3,B000QGDY1K,"""The History of American Railroads: The Years of Steam"" is quite a bargain, considering that it is over four hours of content on one modestly-priced dual-layer DVD.

The first chapter is mostly black-and white, which is acceptable for the time period covered. The other three chapters, from later periods in railroad history, are generally in color. Much of the sound has been dubbed in, not recorded at the same time as the video. That's acceptable for footage taken with silent equipment in the 20s-30s-40s and even into the 50s. But some of the latest footage could have been done with live sound. The result of that is that one often hears a different kind of locomotive than what one sees, and the rhythmic sounds do not sync with the motion of the driving wheels.

Much of the content on this DVD has been previously published. Chapter 3: ""Years of Transition II"" can also be seen on the previously released ""American Steam in the Fifties and Sixties."" I recognized virtually all of the footage contained in ""Years of Transition I"" but have not identified the video that contained that footage in an earlier release.

It's good footage, and very nostalgic and enjoyable. And there's certainly lots of it!  But be prepared to get some duplicate footage if you already have a modest railfan library.",1215388800,47,1303,4.829596412556054

2838079,3,B000QGDY1K,"In a word, disappointing. As far as ""The age of steam"" goes, even if we're only talking of railroads. Very limited, and incomplete as far as just how important and encompassing the steam railroads were to civilization. ... not worth the money ... sammy",1409270400,,252,4.75

2838094,5,B000QGDY1K,I was very young when steam engines roamed the county side. They were fascinating machines to watch. This video brings back many fond memories and fills in a lot of gaps that I missed out on. I am working on a model train set up and kind of working on the main theme to be late 1800's early 1900's. This video helps me put thins in order,1390867200,,337,4.044776119402985

2838096,5,B000QGDY1K,"So much action footage that can never be done again.  Glad it is preserved.  My whole family was in railroading--brother was locomotive fireman then engineer on steam before the diesels.  Did a couple excursion trains with live steam in later years.
Father was conductor--retired with 46 yrs on CB&Q.
Great for anyone that likes the age of steam.",1387238400,,346,4.931034482758621

2838099,5,B000QGDY1K,"I am very pleased, product arrived on time and was packed properly.  This is a very nice arrangement of American
railroads and steam power.  The DVD contains four segments of history and is approximately four hours of viewing
past generations of steam power from various railroads in action in the United States.  The cover color photograph
is of ex - Savannah and Atlanta 750 4-6-2 which I have observed many times in Georgia in special excursion
service.  I watched part yesterday and will try to complete today.  The segment of Norfolk and Western Steam in
actual service was very good and I remember my Dad taking me on vacation to Roanoke, Virginia and he had arranged
a tour through the Norfolk & Western shops where the N&W designed and built their own locomotives.  Also, we saw
these great locomotives in coal service in action in the region around Roanoke.",1380672000,,866,4.778523489932886

2838101,3,B000QGDY1K,"I found out that this set included a lot of footage that I had already seen packaged in other manners.

The quality is great and it is still a good watch, but too often the same ""stock footage"" is being sold in many different packages.

If you a new railfan, good value for the price.

If not.. be sure to check BEFORE you buy.",1377129600,,327,4.078125

Dtart with the Penydarrin of 1803 and the reasons for crosshead versus walking beam.  Hopefully a DVD covering these aspects of steam evolution will be forthcoming.  Other than these points, this DVD covers the subject matter rather well.",1368835200,,377,5.448275862068965
2838104,5,B000QGDY1K,"Arrived on time and in good condition.
Very enjoyable; brought back many memories of childhood and steam engine trains.
Our home was a short distance from double tracks. East and West bound trains carrying freight, coal,
passengers and  mail. The trains  passed by on such a schedule  that one could set their watch by the train arrival time.
Night and day, we would hear the train whistle many miles away, around the bend of the Kanawha
River. Trains traveling down river had a different sound, as if the load was not as heavy as trains traveling the other direction.
I'll never forget trains carrying WW2 prisoners of war. Where they were going I'll never know, but I remember saying ""they look like us!""
I was very pleased with the sound and picture quality. The Train History DVD was such a bargain I intend to look for more!",1362009600,,829,4.625850340136054

2838106,5,B000QGDY1K,The old steam trains are special.  I used to watch them go by close up.  The sound and the ground trembling will always be a fond memory.  The video brings back lots of those times.,1353974400,,181,4.114285714285714

As I have purchased quite a few, however, much of what is contained in this one I have already seen in others previously purchased.  Do yourself a favor.

In my quest for a specific DVD on steam trains, I've purchased numerous DVD's, they change the titles and give it a different cover, or it comes in a package on trains. So I'm dissappointed in being tricked into buying the same product over and over...While the DVD witnessed years ago on the history channel that focused on the New York  Central & Penn Central railroads and the blazing speeds between the two stations  seems to have disappeared...This specific product is a good one, but I need only one!",1335744000,4,575,4.857142857142857
2838110,5,B000QGDY1K,"This documentary may be a bit dryer than its equivalents from the History Channel, but only because it contains extra information I think could only have come from the railroad industry itself.
