8435681,1,B004M8SRGK,"This video is geared toward people who are overweight, and I did not find the workouts fun nor challenging. I wish I would have known that this was a beginner workout DVD, I would have never purchased it.",1338940800,3,204,4.394736842105263
8435682,5,B004M8SRGK,"The ""Lose Weight In 8"" DVD gives us 3 cardio/strength workouts and 2 recovery workouts.  I enjoyed all 5 workouts.  This is an 8 week program in which you do the 5 workouts each week.

Cardio/strength workouts:  Each has its own very short mini-warmup and mini-cooldown.  Each workout is based on 3 circuits of exercises.

1. Athletic conditioning (about 33 and 1/2 minutes)
Paul Vincent instructs.  Designed for weight loss, this workout has 3 circuits based on the following eight moves.

Dumbbell swing with one dumbbell
Pushup with twist
Spinal extension
Bronco
Prone bridging
Crunch and a roll
Wall angel
Split jump

2. Agility X (about 32 minutes)
Kenny Kane instructs.  This is a full body cardio workout and you need space to move.  This workout contains four limb movements on the floor mixed with exercises which involve punching and kicking.  This workout is intense and may be difficult.

3. Yoga sculpt (under 32 minutes)
Kathy Faulstich instructs.  Workout involves ""eight traditional yoga poses with dynamic full body movements"".  Five exercises use dumbbells, and three do not.  This is the easiest of the three workouts.

Recovery Workouts are light and easy, designed to help you rejuvenate and be limber. Workouts are between 15 to 17 minutes.

1. Recovery 1 involves stretches.  Mr. Vincent instructs and uses straps or a towel and a foam roller on some stretches.

2. Recovery 2 is a ""yoga inspired recovery"" workout.  Ms. Faulstich instructs. You may want a mat or carpetted floor.  She works on joint stability, stretching, and alignment.",1320969600,6,1561,5.03921568627451
8435683,5,B004M8SRGK,"I am addicted to the Yoga Sculpt. I am an avid runner and love how the Yoga Sculpt compliments my running.  It has made me stronger and leaner which isn't bad at almost 51.  Additionally, it has gotten my back in shape which has lessened my aches and pains .. I like to call them growing pains because I'm growing older :-)",1304899200,3,323,4.193548387096774
8435684,5,B004M8SRGK,"I loved this workout series! The trainers are so knowledgeable and the recovery workout really helped my IT band syndrome. I especially love Kenny's agility X workout. I feel a little silly, but then I remember that I'm in my living room and it doesn't matter. Especially when I'm totally sore the next day :)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lose-Weight-In-8/dp/B004M8SRGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lose Weight In 8</a>",1297900800,2,457,6.508196721311475
8435685,5,B004M8SRGK,"I have done all of the workouts in the ""Lose Weight in 8"" series! I am a HUGE fun of Athletic Conditioning and Yoga Sculpt. They are intense cardio and strength building workouts that are no more than 35 minutes! I typically workout an hour and a half a day, but on days that I do one of these workouts, I only need an hour. If you do these workouts consistently, you will without a doubt see results before you know it!",1297900800,2,420,4.134146341463414
8435686,4,B004M8SRGK,I have done the three 30 minute workouts. My favorite is Agility X. It is hardcore. I don't feel the Xtreme Conditioning workout is quite as extreme as the Agility X but it is okay and I did enjoy the yoga strength with weights as well. I do find myself going back to the Agility X time and time again though.,1297814400,3,309,4.081967213114754
8435687,5,B004M8SRGK,"This workout system is terrific. It uses some old school moves (like from gym class) that really work! The recovery days workouts are helpful to get past the soreness while still getting some exercise! The trainers use ""regular"" people to show the moves and are very motivating. I highly recommend this system...it can be used by anyone, regardless of fitness level.",1297814400,3,366,5.016393442622951
8435688,4,B004M8SRGK,"ok, so I definitely have lots of workout dvds with workouts for abs, butt, thighs (blah blah) but this DVD really gave me a run for my money. These workouts have really dynamic moves like ""the bronco"" and some advanced version of a leap frog move. I was sore for days and definitely see a difference in my figure!! Definitely try it out--I haven't done moves like this before.",1297814400,6,376,4.463768115942029
