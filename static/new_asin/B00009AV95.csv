1882665,3,B00009AV95,"This anime drove me crazy. The story went on forever, barely getting anywhere. It seemed like it would get really good, but I was kept waiting, kept in suspense, for nothing but disappointment. So the ending isn't totally anti-climatic, but it was a big letdown after all they make you go through. I suppose it's worth watching just to see, but if you don't have the patience, then don't bother! Oh yeah, and they seemed to use the same music over and over again, with English lyrics that didn't seem to make sense. At first it was okay, but after a while it became annoying.",1062115200,3,575,4.485714285714286
1882666,5,B00009AV95,"These episodes seem to start out a bit out of sync with the previous DVD's as the scene opens on Tsukasa, Mimiru, and Bear on entering a game event together.  And as long as the competition stays at an intellectual level Tsukasa appears as if he has had some deep change in attitude.  But once the team must give battle, Tsukasa reveals a deep distrust of people he considers 'adults,' accusing Mimiru and Baer of selfishness.  In a sense, this causes a crisis of faith, and actually marks the real beginning of Tsukasa's development as more than a mystery.
Bear's researches in the outside world reveal that Tsukasa's inability to log off could be the result of his lying in what appears to be a hopeless coma.  This is the first hint we have that there is something seriously wrong on the outside as well as lurking in the game.  What has yet to be revealed is if this is a personal tragedy or something more global.  What it does as a plot device is to set up the quest for The Key of the Twilight, something that Mimiru and Bear believe will allow Tsukasa to log out.
Tsukasa himself has no desire to log out, but desperately wants to awaken the mysterious girl in white.  And BT, Crim, and Sora have come together in a twisted triangle, each seeking the key for their own reasons.  In a sense, Tsukasa has identified a key sub-theme when he expresses his own distrust.  For nothing is at it seems in The World and while the quest provides many thrilling moments, what the players find is far more disturbing than they expected.
There is no lack of mysteries left to be resolved.  What are the motives of the cat figure, or lady Subaru's connection with Tsukasa?  And why is Helba, the hacker from the PS2 series getting involved?  All we know of any of the players is their game personas.  While many ring true, the viewer must keep in mind that this is a fantasy within a fantasy.  Reality lurks just over the horizon, and may bring its own shocks.
The accompanying CD is the music from .hack//LUMINOSITY, the OVA series included in the game, and is quite good.  By far the best of the three CD's provided so far.",1058054400,6,2119,4.439276485788113
1882667,4,B00009AV95,"The mysterious ""Key of the Twilight"" continues to take center stage in this third volume of the slow-moving, philosphical "".hack"" series. Tsukasa, a player trapped and unable to log out of The World, an online role-playing game with millions of players, begins to become more outgoing, and goes on a puzzle-solving event, or mission, with buddies Mimiru and Bear.
This volume shows more of the beautifully and cleverly done flashes to the ""real world,"" which have already been shown in earlier episodes. The real world is often depicted in grainy black and white, without the characters faces being shown. The flashes in this volume are more serious, and played out like a silent film. A doctor and presumably the parent of a comatose child argue over whether the plug should be pulled. These sequences are classic: intercuts between the angry conversation, to black screens that quiver with the words of the conversation. Similarly, Tsukasa begins to flashback to the real world as well, in what seems to be a traumatic, abusive childhood.
In The World, groups have formed to attempt to find ""The Key of the Twilight,"" a key that supposedly could a) reset The World or, b) throw it into chaos or, c) release Tsukasa from The World. To get it, two groups--Crim and B.T. tailed by Sora, as well as Mimiru, Bear and Tsukasa--open the ""Eye of the Twilight"" and encounter ""the broken man,"" an old figure floating around mumbling and ranting, with broken bits and pieces of information which only Tsukasa seems to comprehend.
This is a major turning point in this series, which, if you've watched this much of it, should have you confused and addicted. The great art, and beautiful, but sometimes ill-used music, can compensate for the long, philosophical, thought-provoking story. This is one of the more action-packed volumes of the series, however, which features a fight between equally powered and skilled swordsmen Crim and Sora, arguably two of the more powerful players in the game.
I loved this series up to the ending, but only one thing can cure that...the necessary continuation to .hack. If this series ends on the note that it does, it will be one of the most heartbreaking 26 episodes of anime that I have watched because it teases you with so much, but gives you so little. If, and how it continues into another or maybe three more seasons, will ultimately determine how great .hack can be.",1057449600,5,2401,4.872860635696822
1882668,5,B00009AV95,"Though this DVD currently isn't out at the writing of this review, I have seen every single episode of Dot Hack Sign (all 26 episodes). While the dialog differs slightly between the US and Japanese versions, it isn't different enough to cause any discrepancies between the two releases. I feel, therefore, that I can give an accurate review of this DVD. Dot Hack Sign is a highly story-oriented series, and relies on dialog, story, and character development. It should be noted that Dot Hack Sign's story DEVELOPS SLOWLY. Impatient people who are disinterested in character development should probably not watch this. There isn't any action in the series (other than a few brief fight scenes, and an awesome fight scene in the second-to-last episode), and there is no violence to be seen. This sets it apart from other anime titles that may be seen as shallow, due to their exploits of gore and flesh. The episodes featured on this DVD develop Tsukasa's character quite a lot, and the third episode, Castle, reveals a lot about the secrets behind The World. It also has some very frightening events. If there are any disappointed people who've watched Dot Hack Sign up until now, this might be a turning point. I cannot speak for others though, because I was hooked on Dot Hack Sign since the first episode. Dot Hack Sign is my favorite series out of anything, anime, cartoon, or live-action, and I highly recommend it to people who want to embark on a long and great story.
Recommended to: People who enjoy long, elaborate, wonderful, and exciting stories, and people who enjoy stories that have compelling characters and events.
Not recommended to: People who prefer flashy animation, violence, action, or other adultish content that is generally associated with anime. People who hate intricate stories that develop slowly SHOULD NOT WATCH Dot Hack Sign! You'll likely be disappointed and give it a bad review. =(",1053734400,6,1916,4.934984520123839

The only problem I have with it, as the same with any anime dvd, is the price. Very expensive!! Especially for a 13 year old like me..I'm so poor!! T.T I assure you though, it is worth the price.

7990509,2,B00009AV95,"First off, let me just say that I've only watched .Hack//Sign up to the end of Gestalt. Also, this is more of a review on the series up to this point, rather that Gestalt alone. You can form your own opinion from that.
Now, at first I loved .Hack//Sign. I was captivated by the entire concept of character relationships inside an online game. But soon, the effect wore off. The episodes became so bland and monotonous, even major events in the series (like the last episode in Gestalt) failed to rekindle my interest in Tsukasa's plight. Most of the scenes just feel like filler... as if .Hack//Sign, up to this point in the series at least, could have been done with half the episodes.
As for the soundtrack, it's mediocre. A few good instrumental songs, but nothing to scream about.
But if you like the .Hack video games, I'm sure you will enjoy this series more than I. It just seems to me that there are better animes out there that focus on character development... even if they do lack .Hack//Sign's original concept.
If you've sincerely enjoyed .Hack//Sign up to Gestalt, then you will most likely enjoy this DVD. If you're having doubts about where this series is going, than you may want to save your money.",1071792000,,1216,4.608294930875576
7990510,4,B00009AV95,"I love the DVD and the series.
This is just a note to those who might be getting the DVD with the CD as I did.
Disk 3 and 4 have what can only be described as moderate music disks. I like most all the songs on the first two disks but the third and fourth music disks have almost nothing new or nothing worth making mention of. Decent enough for background noise but not for active listening. Maybe one or two real good songs on each of these CD's.
It's simply my opinion that if you know someone else who is collecting the series with the music dics to borrow them before you pay for them.",1067299200,4,589,4.042735042735043
7990511,5,B00009AV95,"This is so far the best of the .hack//sign series I have seen to date.  This volume contains a lot of action as Tsukasa, Bear, and Mimiru search for the Key of the Twilight.  When I first watched it I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
If you are looking for a really fast paced series then I would not recommend this one, but if you are looking for a story with an intricate plot, developed characters, and a theme that asks some very key questions about the worlds (both online and off) then I would recommend this one.",1067212800,2,530,4.135922330097087
