173988,5,0976039230,"What makes this film so very special is precisely that you have to remind yourself repeatedly that it's not fiction.  Yet it's 100% true.  That viewers easily can lose sight of that is the best testament to the skill and good fortune of its maker, Michael Keyser (himself an SCCA Porsche pilot of the era).

As with any documentary, it's a little rough around the production edges.  But, except perhaps during the interviews, they didn't have multiple takes, the racing is REAL!  And so is the 1972 season it documents.  To see Dr. Helmut Marko (now Seb Vettel's and Mark Webber's boss) interviewed at his home, riding off on his dirt bike, to hear his views about the insanity of the Targa Florio, then see part of his record-setting lap there, then see him on the stretcher after losing his eye at the French GP, plus his helmet with the hole in the shield -- all these are the incredible, yet tangible measures of the theme of the film, that the sport at that time was more than a little like Russian roulette.

To see and hear Jo Bonnier at Sebring, and arriving at Le Mans, then hear Vic Elford's description of his fatal crash -- and the haunting footage of Vic stopping to check on the burning Ferrari Daytona, then to see the poignant scene of Bonnier's team's trucks leaving the track after his death, palpably convey the levels of risk the drivers faced every day.  What makes this film so important is that all these events are so rare today that people conflate this film with contrived ""race stories"" like ""Le Mans"" or ""Grand Prix.""

Thankfully, we've now come so far that they do, because, once upon a time, it was that dangerous indeed.",1332633600,,1651,4.550675675675675
173989,4,0976039230,"Great video but I always wonder why racing engine ""music"" is replaced with stereo music. This video has p[laces for the stereo music but puts it where the racing sounds should be.",1329264000,,179,4.625
173990,5,0976039230,"Excellent documentary, narrated by Vic Elford, of the 1972 World Sportscar season. A great drivers'/insider's look at sportscar racing.  A must for fans of vintage racing.",1323820800,,171,5.576923076923077
173991,4,0976039230,"Archaic video and sound but a very good ""grass roots"" racing film of drivers who mostly went on to become part of the fabric of sports car racing world-wide.  Not a glamorous movie at all but rather shows racing pretty much how it was, how far it has come and how fundamental the cars were - safety hardly existed.  Grand Prix is the most complete and beautifully told, filmed, music-ed and stared racing movie made but Speed Merchants is equally good in basically the opposite way.",1304035200,,482,4.593023255813954
173992,5,0976039230,"This is the best racing film ever.  I read one earlier complaint that there is a lack of race by race ""coverage"" of the season.  This film is about people, not a race season.  Very real, very human.  (It is interesting that the list of ""what other movies were bought"" includes LeMans, which is without a doubt, the worst racing film ever.)",1260230400,3,339,4.419354838709677
173993,5,0976039230,"WHAT YOU GET: great footage of a very picturesque period of motor racing; some actual unguarded commentary from the drivers; lots of period details, like the fashions, or the fly yellow Daytona Syder parked in the Sebring paddock with some kind of chintzy lettering on the doors advertising a car dealership (? I think); also, footage (and interviews!) with the gorgeous Mrs. Jacky Ickx and Mrs. Helmut Marko.

WHAT YOU MISS: race coverage that approaches what we expect these days, eg., footage that conveys a sense of a developing drama, (the notable exception is the great Targa Florio sequence, where you can really see the cars squirming under power, and the drama of the race builds to a climax). You will also miss the sound of the engines, (or, barring that, silence), when the ill-conceived music starts.

The main disappointment in this disc is the director's unerring ability to suck most of the drama out of all the races here. The bad music plays a big part in this.

But I shouldn't complain. I do treasure this movie, rating it right alongside Grand Prix, Le Mans and the impossible-to-find The Racing Scene. But in the end the balance between off-track and on-track footage tilts a little too heavily away from the action.

All the usual cinema verite indulgences are here, like trying to ""reproduce the rhythm of a top racing driver's day-to-day life"" (drivers laying around a pool, drivers suiting up to go motorbike riding, drivers walking through the woods...). We get ham-fisted crosscutting between an injured driver in the hospital and a race (though they did not occur simultaneously). These are the exasperating stylistic tics of the era, I suppose, (they're great when they work!) and they can try your patience a little; but for a racing fan it IS entertaining to see Jacky Ickx (and his wife!) surveying their house as it is being built, or Brian Redman clowning with his daughter.

The narration by ""Quick"" Vic Elford and Mario Andretti contributes a lot--it projects a lot of their personality and adds some depth without feeling forced or pretentious.

It's the music that's the real villain of the piece. It is terrible for this sort of thing. While the audio of the engines is excellent (you hear the great flat-12 Ferraris, the Alfa V-12, and the Matras), the music is painfully inert and seems to swoon into prominence at the first flicker of any potentially exciting footage, tramping down the interest faster than a French scrutineer can toss a car from tech inspection.

PRICELESS: seeing the Ferrari racing department assembling the 312PB's in what seems an unbelievably rustic environment, and then visiting Autodelta, Alfa Romeo's race shop down the road, which looks like somebody's storage-unit: man, was it gloriously primitive back then!",1209254400,7,2782,4.982758620689655
173994,4,0976039230,"One of the must haves for all road racing fans. Gives a good insight on what it took to be a professional race driver in the early 70's. Great behind the scene footage of world champion drivers Jacky Ickx, Brian Redman, Helmut Marko, Vic Elford, and Mario Andretti. You also get some outstanding footage of their cars in action at world class circuits.

Video and sound are very dated, but hey it was the early 70's. If you own movies such as ""Grand Prix"", Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"", and ""in car 956"" this will be a great addition to your video library.",1205107200,6,553,4.421568627450981
7794659,5,0976039230,"A great documentary of the golden era of sports car racing, it's even more special now. The window into the thoughts and lives of racing immortals like Mario Andretti, Vic Elford, Brian Redman, current Red Bull F1 boss Dr. Helmut Marko and more takes you back to the way things really were, without the misty-eyed filters. At times you'll wonder how in the world did they get that footage? The rest of the time you'll just be thankful that they did.",1525737600,,449,4.555555555555555
