Finally this great 80's series makes it onto dvd!
It would make a great halloween treat if it were to be released on halloween!
or friday the 13th!

3154167,5,B00168OILM,"Fans of this show have waited 22 years to finally acquire this on DVD. While the arrival of Friday the 13th: The Series on DVD is great, I am a little disappointed in the soundtrack. The sound on the TV broadcast of the show was incredible. It had so much depth and full bass-rich sound, but the dvds to not have that. Not only that, but the menu offers no audio set up. They should have included DTS Surround sound. If they had, the set would be perfect.",1212364800,,455,4.181818181818182

3154170,5,B00168OILM,"It's about time, Paramount! Thank you for finally giving the dedicated fans of the series their show on DVD. One of the very best sci-fi/thriller/drama programs ever to hit the air. Creative, quirky, haunting and filled with endearing and powerful performances from a truly stellar cast (regulars and guest stars alike).",1211587200,5,320,5.294117647058823
3154171,5,B00168OILM,"With all the shows released mere weeks after the original has aired, I couldn't figure out why a cult-fan favourite like F13 the series was still unavailable decades after the original airing of the show!!  Add to that the stinkers that HAVE been release on DVD and it made the situation extra perplexing!

So I was thrilled to see that, after years of waiting, F13 the series will finally be released on DVD!!  My best friend and I have been watching the show since it originally aired in 1987, when we were 10 years old!  In fact, we were obsessed enough with the show to maintain a website about it 20 years later! :-D

The plot goes something like this: Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to get rich by selling cursed antiques.  After breaking the pact with the devil, he is killed, and Micki and Ryan inherit the store.  They don't know about its accursed past, or the cursed antiques in the downstairs vault.  Consequently, they sell off most of the vault's contents before finally discovering the awful truth.  Once the dark secret revealed by Jack Marshack, Lewis Vendredi's old friend, the trio sets out to collect all of the cursed antiques and put them back into the vault where they cannot harm anyone ever again.

The show follows the lives of Micki, Ryan, Jack, and (primarily in Season 3) Johnny as they attempt to hunt down cursed antiques.  It is a weird and fantastic show that is fun, campy, and creepy all at the same time! The characters are great together, the plots are generally really imaginative, and it is easy to get sucked into the atmosphere! Happy viewing fellow fans! We've waited so long!",1211500800,38,1629,4.602076124567474
3154172,5,B00168OILM,I watched this show when it originally aired and thought it was a terrific show saddled by a terrible title because it had nothing to do with the movie series - except that Paramount owned the title.  The series has been airing on the Chiller channel for a while - probably in edited format and missing an episode or two from syndication - and the DVD release is long overdue.  Every fan needs to pick this set up and non-fans should consider giving it a try.  It's got some 80s cheese-tastic episodes but there are some really great episodes as well.  This long-awaited release is worth the price.,1211500800,3,598,4.5092592592592595
3154173,5,B00168OILM,One of the best TV shows EVER. I still can't believe they have never released these on DVD.,1208649600,,91,4.111111111111111
3154174,5,B00168OILM,"Unfortunately the title made people believe that this had something to do with Jason, promiscuous teenagers, and Camp Crystal Lake.  In truth, it had absolutely nothing to do with it.

This Canadian-made suspense drama's plot consisted of an antique dealer who made a deal with Satan to sell cursed artifacts.  The artifacts all brought the bearer some great benefit, but at a terrible price.  When his conscience  finally caught up with him, however, the devil turned on him and captured his soul.  His co-worker, along with his nephew and his cousin (played by Robey - one of the hottest redheads to ever grace our TV screens), set out to reclaim all the artifacts and return them to a secured and consecrated vaults where the artifacts can do no more harm.

Each episode deals with the team trying to reclaim a new artifact.  There are some truly incredible moments of drama in this series showing how people can be seduced by evil, even though they have the purest hearts or intentions.

Seasons 1 & 2 are incredible, and the finale to season 2 blew me away more than any episode of any TV show.  Season 3 saw the departure of one of the lead characters, which many see as the ""Jump The Shark"" moment, but the other two characters and the new actor still do an admirable job after loosing a key character.

The whole series is available elsewhere online - just do a search and you can find the whole collection, region-free, for under $50.  It's well worth it for any sci-fi, suspense, or horror fans.  (FYI - The show is not gory - it gets its impact from a very Hitchcock-like use of lighting and misdirection).

Buy it - you'll love it.",1206835200,70,1643,4.563139931740614

3154207,4,B00168OILM,"The product is advertised as having subtitles but there aren't any, which is pretty unfortunate given the poor sound quality.

3154208,2,B00168OILM,"UPDATE: My original review is below but I had to add one more comment that knocked this product down from a four-star to a two-star rating. In my first review I explain why the picture quality of this show isn't as good as it could be. However, after recently watching a few of the episodes, I realize that the image quality varies drastically from episode to episode. One episode will be okay (the best review ANY episode's visuals will get from me) while the next will be close to looking like a worn VHS. There is no legit excuse for this save that the original masters were mishandled, not stored properly or destroyed and they had to use back-ups. There is no way these episodes aired in the 80s looking like this. There are episodes I can't watch all the way through due to how bad the image is. Such a waste.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: My four star rating is for the series itself, not the release. I, like many others, am disappointed in the picture quality of the episodes. Many have posted on here that they have seen broadcasts and recorded VHS tapes that looked better. While I cannot comment on that, I can explain the core reason why the release looks the way it does and why we many never get a better one.

Back in the 80s when TV syndication started becoming a popular means of getting TV shows to the masses, many studios were trying to capitalize on their properties as well as find the cheapest way to produce them. Paramount created Star Trek: The Next Generation and Friday the 13th: The Series to do just this. Both were shot on film but then the raw footage was transferred, edited and (this is key) mastered on videotape. What this means is that no matter how the shows are seen (broadcast, DVD or even transferred in HD), they will have to be taken from an SD tape master. The only way to get a pristine picture is to go back to the raw film footage, transfer that to HD and then re-edit the entire series. This is a monstrous undertaking (pardon the pun) and only a series with a large fan-base would have any hope of getting this treatment (as Star Trek: The Next Generation has enjoyed over the last couple of years--Netflix now has it in Blu Ray quality and it is much better than the blurry HD they were showing).

I will agree that the DVDs of F13: The Series looks even shoddier than the explanation above can justify. It appears that the episodes were taken from copies of masters rather than from the master tapes themselves. However, if anyone out there is thinking there will eventually be a release of F13: The Series in a crystal-clear Blu Ray edition you may want to temper those hopes a little. Unfortunately, no one in the 80s could have imagined there would be anything close to HD and did not use the time or money to prepare their shows for it.

I'm glad I bought this DVD set and will enjoy it for what it is: a fond look back on a show that gave me chills growing up.",1452556800,,2905,4.364140480591497

3154213,5,B00168OILM,"When FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES debuted in 1987 it wasn't exactly bright on my radar. I was aware of it, and even saw an episode I thought was very good (""Doctor Jack""), but until recently I'd forgotten the show ever existed. When a friend of mine mentioned it recently in passing, I had a sudden, inexplicable desire to buy the first season on the spot, and so I did...and boy am I glad, because I haven't had this much fun with a TV show in a long, long time.

FRIDAY THE 13TH was produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., the same guy who brought us the notorious slasher films of the same name, so you could be forgiven if you thought this was a biopic of Jason Voorhees set in Crystal Lake. Actually it has nothing to do with the hockey-masked killer, but is an entirely different story, albeit very much in the horror vein. Here goes:

Lewis Vendredi (R.G. Armstrong) made a pact with the devil. In return for wealth and immortality, he agreed to sell to the unwary customers of his antique shop items which had been cursed by Satan. When Vendredi tried to go back on the pact, he is sent to hell and the shop was left to his neice Micki Foster (Louise Robey), and her cousin by marriage Ryan Dallion (John D. LeMay). The two clueless relations are quickly educated as the true nature of the store's stock by a former business partner of Vandredi's named Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins), who had no idea the items he was selling Lewis were being used in such an evil manner until it was too late. Renaming the shop Curious Goods, the three of them set out to recover each of the more than 200 cursed items in circulation and place them in safekeeping so that they can do no more damage. This is easier said than done, of course, as each object carries a different curse -- and therefore a different danger.

I should probably start by addressing the show's three principal faults to get them out of the way. First, and especially during the early episodes, the budget for F13 was obviously very low, which affected every aspect of the production, an affect heightened for the modern viewer by the now horribly-dated special effects. Second, also most notably in the early going, the acting and writing are wildly inconsistent, with Robey tending to over-emote and DeMay tending to deliver the nervous, uncertain performance of a young actor out of his depth.  Last, the style in which the series is executed is very portentous, with a lot of awkward moments: weak cliffhangers, bad jokes, and cheesy melodrama. When the show is bad, it's very bad indeed.

Having said that, this is a series that gleefully transcends its faults, and not merely because as the season wore on, the budget clearly increased -- even to the point of getting David Cronenberg as a guest director. Yes, many of the flaws were ironed out, and the episodes in the later seasons had flashy cinematography, better character actors for backup, and an ambitiously large scope; but the reason I found it so compulsively watchable was because it foreshadowed many of the characteristics which were to make shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, SUPERNATURAL and FRINGE so popular in later years. It combines surprisingly bloody and gruesome horror with sharp and seditious wit, whilie utilizing a family-style dynamic among the cast, and backing up a good-size truck of sexual tension in the bargain. Jack is the wise but somewhat enigmatic father-figure with the shadowy past; Micki is surefooted and responsible but restraining great passions; Ryan is the immature slacker coming to grips with manhood and destiny. Together they produce that chemistry and likeability that ever show strives for but very few achieve. Just as importantly, this is a horror show that really delivers the goods. The curses are full of terrible irony, the villains diverse in their villainy, and the killings are grisly and, considering the time period, extremely graphic and long-winded: you'll see people burned alive, electrocuted, riddled with bullets, stabbed, impaled, beheaded, and in one case, drowned in a toilet. And going beyond this, and despite its humor, FRIDAY was a not a series which was afraid of unhappy endings. Some of the quests were less successful than others, and as the season wore on, each of the characters suffered a terrible, personal loss which made them question whether they wanted to continue fighting the good fight.

A few of my favorite episodes:

""Cupid's Quiver"" -- A cursed cupid doll becomes a collegiate loser's ticket to love, with the caveat that every woman he seduces must be murdered afterward. Some great acting by Denis Forest as the bad guy.

""A Cup of Time"" -- A female rock star uses a cursed cup to remain young. Nice twists in this plot, as well as some great 80s rock 'n roll ""fashion.""

""Doctor Jack"" -- A wonderfully atmospheric episode about a mediocre doctor who obtains Jack the Ripper's scalpel and becomes a world-class surgeon, the catch being that the scalpel must be ""fed"" with a murder after every operation.

""Scarecrow"" -- The gang tackles a woman whose scarecrow promises a superb harvest...provided it gets to collect three heads per growing season.

""Faith Healer"" -- directed by David Cronenberg, this one features a glove which can transfer disease or injury from one person to another: a startlingly brutal episode with some very Cronenberg-like gore.

""Vanity's Mirror"" -- A cursed compact gives a homely, bitter high school girl an opportunity to get even with her tormentors and snag the man of her dreams: her sister's boyfriend.

""Tattoo"" -- In trouble with the mob, a hotheaded loser from Chinatown acquires tattoo needles that exchange luck at the card table for human lives.

""The Quilt of Hathor"" -- In this two-part episode, Ryan and Micki infiltrate an Amish-type sect being torn apart by a cursed quilt that grants the darkest dreams of anyone who sleeps beneath it.

""Double Exposure"" - The guys bang heads with an amoral reporter who uses a cursed camera to commit serial murders.

""The Pirate's Promise"" - Taking a page out of THE FOG, this one involves a cursed foghorn, the ghost of a pirate, and a hit list 200 years old.

""What A Mother Wouldn't Do"" -- One of the most brutal stories, about an antique crib which demands seven lives in return for restoring a terminally ill baby's health.

As I said, FRIDAY is a series with many, many flaws, but at the same time I found it compulsively watchable and a great deal of fun. It not only delivers the sort of old-school horror-movie atmosphere I greatly enjoy, it clearly had an enormous influence, directly or indirectly, on people like Chris Carter, Joss Whedon, Tim Kring, David Greenwalt, and others who enjoyed considerably more pop-culture fame. I'm a bit mystified as to how I didn't start watching this in high school...but better a quarter century late than never, right?",1429660800,3,6881,4.797297297297297

I remember it was often on late at night, and it scared the crap out of us.  (I was only nine when the show started.  We're talking scars.)  Anyway, I was worried it wouldn't hold up, but was pleasantly surprised.  It's definitely of the period, and it tends toward the formulaic, but there is some flat-out awesome stuff in this show.  The premise is great, using classic horror structures that go back to Dr. Faustus.  The cast is appealing.  The scares pushed the envelope at the time, and are still damn effective today.  Episodes directed by Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg are both in this first season.  Additionally, the two-part episode ""The Quilt of Hathor"" is absolutely awesome - it scared me to death as a kid and I found it surprisingly complex and layered as an adult.  For those who like their horror with a Satanic flair or an antiquarian, occult-tinged flavor - you'll love this show.  The show also manages to evoke a big universe - where larger horrors are hinted at, where every ghost story has great backstory.  Fun stuff, inspiring cribsheet for horror writers, and a great example of this flavor of horror.  It's not Proust, but it's fun as hell.",1349395200,,1294,4.569565217391304

3154263,5,B00168OILM,"Friday the 13th the series is one of those shows that when I first heard about it coming to TV way back in the 1980s I was like, what the...?! How is a show based on Jason Voorhees going to work on a weekly basis? It would get old really fast. Then more details started to emerge about the plot synopsis...""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to sell cursed antiques..."" And, well, you all know the drill--turned out the show had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the psycho slasher films starring ol' hockey mask-faced Jason Voorhees after all. And then I thought to myself, What a great concept for a TV series! And so it was. From the start I watched it weekly and quickly became a fan.

Fast forward all these years later and here I am watching these now classic episodes on DVD and they are just as great as I remember them to be. It's great to finally be able to see this show again featuring favorite characters such as Ryan, Micki, and Jack Marshak, played wonderfully by the great John D. Lemay, Louise Robey, and Chris Wiggins. It feels like being reunited with long lost friends again.

As others have mentioned before in previous reviews, there is something to be desired with the picture quality, it's not as good as it could be. Actually, it's not really all that bad and some episodes look much better than others, but for the most part the quality is passable, and for the price that I paid, more than acceptable enough to be able to revisit this old series.

The series takes off with quality acting, stories, and special effects. How they got away with some of the violence is incredible.

Besides the regulars, Friday was also adept at reusing some of the guest stars. For example, the girl in the story of the compact also plays a different character in a story of a stop watch. A farmer in the scarecrow story plays a doctor in the Indian rattle story. The low IQ guy in the ""Brain Drain"" episode also played in the sport ring episode. There are numerous others who played different characters throught the series run. It was sort of thelike the 4 main characters, Micki, Ryan, Jack, and Johnny, and the Not-Ready-For-Horror-Movies-Players.

Lemay), his beautiful, high-maintenance cousin Micki Foster (Louise Robey billed simply as Robey) and the wise-old sage and once close friend of Mr. Vandredi, Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins) (whom offers his knowledge of the occult and whom is often a key factor in their surviving the various deadly situations they find themselves struggling against) who are attempting to retrieve Uncle Lewis' cursed odds and ends, where they can be securely entrusted in the store's basement vault and away from the perverse temptations of the outside world.

Risking being dismissed as a complete goof, F13TS manages to maintain a fine line between credibility and being entirely heedless. Most season one episodes keep the show on due course and manages to be, if not engaging, at least mildly entertaining and inventive. In defense of the seemingly sophomoric teleplays that enfold, the series is low budget at best and shot entirely in Canada, using mostly a Canadian cast and crew. All the while, trying to play itself off as taking place in America. There are faults in this attempt (mostly landmarks and signs which are a constant enemy of location shooting) most of which do not detract the viewer's attention. But, for those of us whom are blessed (or cursed depending upon one's point-of-view) with the ability to pinpoint a mistake in continuity or geographical location within the passing of a film frame or two, these blemishes only go to prove that the show was done quickly and on a shoestring budget and seems to carry about it the constant threat of being axed at any slip of a ratings point! And, while it did manage to thrive for three seasons, most fans revel in the 1st and 2nd seasons in which the character of Ryan was still present. Sadly, Mr. Lemay eventually pursued other interests and thus, the premature fate of the series was set in motion

Having nothing to do with the highly popular and successful film franchise bearing the exact name (something of a major disappointment to `Friday' fans, myself included) the series instead focuses on the hunting down and obtaining of cursed objects sold by Uncle Lewis (Ryan and Micki unknowingly contributed to this debacle when after having just inherited Lewis' antique store (after his bizarre death) they immediately began to sell everything off in the hopes of making a quick buck and getting out of dodge without too much disruption to their personal lives; of which none of the aforementioned happened much to their chagrin) rather than of having anything to do with the big, clumsy, hockey-masked sporting kid named Jason who excels in chopping people up with his oversized machete.

And just as each item is unique as the next, so is the curse that belongs to it. Specifics are not important here as discovering what the item does and how it dispatches its victims is half of the fun! Here's just a few of the primo episodes that make up this 1st season: `The Inheritance', `A Cup of Time', `Hellowe'en', `Doctor Jack', `Root of all Evil', `Faith Healer', The Electrocutioner', `The Quilt of Hathor', `Double Exposure'(as close to Jason Voorhees as one will get in the first season),'The Pirate's Promise', and `What a Mother Wouldn't Do'. Of the 26 season one episodes, the aforementioned are the cr&egrave;me du lay and as the first season draws to an close, we witness it's gradual, yet persistent climb in production value and in the care taken providing stories that are both graphically enlightening and imaginatively unique, while ensuring that our protagonists remain interesting and continue to develop both as a trio, as well as individually. A certain challenge for a series that cost around $500,00 an episode and which became the target of infuriated viewers displeased with the amount of onscreen violence and gore that, for it's time, was running comfortably alongside with many of the R-rated horror films of it's day.

F13TS' look does little to impress. Respectively shot in its original television 1.33:1 aspect ratio, most of the episodes are filled with film grain (the later few discs seem not to have inherited quite so much--of which I question either the transfer of the first few episodes or perhaps as the series grew in popularity, so did the quality of photography?), and colors are often muted and sometimes murky. Though, the series presented here on DVD is an improvement over the original broadcasts, this is far from showroom material. Then, again, were you really expecting `reference' showroom material from a low-budget 80's TV show?

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital Mono and is efficient in delivering clear dialogue. No surrounds. No booming base.

Extras are slim: two original network launch promotional trailers which tally up to 44 seconds worth of material. A ten minute sales presentation sums up the extras department and is nothing more than the various episodes fashioned in montage style and voiced-over by the late Don LaFontaine.

Television history may or may not have taken notice of the `little engine that could' that is `Friday the 13th: the Series', but for those viewers who have come to embrace it over the years the series (""cheese"" factor and all!) still remains a guilty treat filled with hidden dangers, of which we can't help but indulge in anyway. And, I promise if you purchase it you won't get more than what you bargained for!

3154302,5,B00168OILM,"Except for the ridiculous episode where Ryan and Micki infiltrate a Catholic Church looking for a pen, this whole first season was outstanding!  My wife and I crack up at that Church episode because, when they go to the basement of the church, naturally there's a guillotine! LOL... We Catholics always have guillotines at the bottom of our churches, just in case we decide to have a last-minute inquisition! LOL puhllleeze! lol

I forgot actually how BOLD this series was horror-wise for its time. That episode ""Root of all Evil"" where that crazy mutha throws people into a yard shreader and money comes out!?....wowzers! That was gory and all-out creepy! I can't believe they even got that one on TV! lol

Another over-the-top creepy and YET HILARIOUS episode was ""The Electrocutioner.""  A dentist using a cursed electric chair!? Now that's definitely worth signing-on for!

My favorite episodes were: ""The Quilt of Hathor I and II,"" ""Vanity's Mirror,"" ""A Cup of Time,"" ""Bedazzled"" etc.

As interesting an episode as it was, ""The Baron's Bride"" was pretty weird. I like the way our heroes show up at the beginning of the episode to claim a cursed cape only to find out it's in the hands of a vampire. Now what are those odds! Then we get a Jack the Ripper plot to boot! LOL

This series was so much fun, so bold, and the characters were neat. Ryan is quirky and fun, Micki is hot as blazes, Jack is like the uncle you always wanted, and Uncle Lewis is an all-out wackoboy! The haunted antiques/items are downright creepy and clever.

The DVD quality is a tad grainy and most definitely NOT perfect. But as other posters have stated, this was the 80's and the quality at the time. I remember watching this show at midnight after my parents went to bed as a junior high kid. It was a tad grainy and surely not HD lol but it works for me....Don't let a little imperfection snobbery keep you from watching a classic show!

3154316,2,B00168OILM,"I love a good fright  as well as I am sure a lot of others out there as well. Heck I even like a good slasher fick as well but this is not what this review is about. There are Great ways to do a Horror/Sci Fi Show and then there is this series which is most cerainly not. Yes all of these series will have some kind of cheese factor, cliches, and over acting and this FT13TS sad to say had way too much. The sign of a great series is if can be believable and frightening with out having to go to the gore / gross out factor- it is called using the imagination (remember Hitchcock..anyone??) which this series tried to do but failed on so many levels. Running thru the forrest with a tea cup over your head to keep it from the bad guy, or taking a white glove (  ooohhh...dont let him touch you!!) away from a faith healer or even taking a muppet like talking doll away from a little girl episode. ( even Chucky would hate this one!!) Dont even get started on the vampire episode which is so lame it is truly sad and their theory on just how was dracula written- Dont ask you just might gag. Yes, the the gag reflex is off the charts on this- when something is so bad you double over in agony just wishing it was over. This series is not scary or packs any thrills in any sence of the imagination. This series comes accross as a badly acted comedy. It tries too hard and falls flat. It simply does not deliver the chills or thrills or any thing for that matter. The series had great potential but was destroyed by poor writing, Cheezy story lines (aka lack of imagination), unbeilevably silly situations, really  and I mean REALLY bad acting, and the direction was lame as well as the picture quality of this series. Well some will say well this was done in the Mid 1980's and didn't have much to work with and My reply will be well then if you want to see how a really good series is done all you have to do is to go back into the late 60's and 1970's -years before this disaster was made and see two of the most influential series ( thet eventually inspired shows like Tales From the Crypt, Buffy, Angel, Charmed and a few others) those shows were Dark Shadows and The Night Stalker (No not the new one - they butchered that one as well) These series were told in 45 min or less (except for the movies) they had a great formula, story writing/lines, acting, atmosphers, great music, again no gore/ gross out needed. You set the situation up right with atmosphere, great story telling, supurb music, acting , direction and use of camera angles and set up-  add some cheese factor and cliches and what you get was a great laugh followed by a truly thrilling & chilling jump out of your seat experience.  Evey thing that FT13TS lacks on every level. It was so painful to watch I could just get to the middle of the first season before I had to turn it off. I truly could not pick one good episode from the bunch- not one. I truly am suprised by the ""rave"" reviews this recieved. Maybe for Nostalgia sake , but that cant even save the series. I grew up with all of these series and remember this being on TV so when I saw this come out and the reviews I thought well lets give it a try- in what should have been a fun blast truned into a real disappointment, unbearable to watch & a even quicker trip to trade it in. With ""older series like that were released like- Night Gallery, Twilight Zone, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker etc- when they came out on dvd the picture and sound was sharp , crisp and well done. Who ever got hold of this sad series to begin with didn't even bother to clean it up which just adds to the complete disaster that it already is.  The idea was there- but it simply didn't have anything going for it poorly executed in every way. What could have been great just  ends up like a big wet thud. If you like way over the top poorly acted, scripted  and way too cheezy (like Ed Wood movies) you may want to take a peek at this. Other wise if you are looking for a reasonably intelligent and classic series like the ones previously mentioned-you definately want to stay far away from this or you will be looking to off load this dvd at a trade in store with in a week you start watching it. There are just some things that should remain buried and Friday the 13th The Series is sure one of them. Ugh! What a mess.",1236643200,,4329,4.182254196642686

I have waited years and so many times I came close to purchasing bootleg versions - glad I did not because now I have heard of identity theft problems involving those bootleg sellers.  Thanks very much to the studio for finally releasing it, longtime fans such as myself are grateful without a doubt.

I recently completed viewing the entire 1st season set.  First, the pro's.  The episodes are on a menu, that's great because I've heard some series like the new Sarah Connor series are not.  All of the disks played without any issues - also, something that is not universally guaranteed, since I've had tvdvd disks that were bad (wouldn't play or some episodes had glitches).  No problems at all with the playback.  I like the thin-style case (regular dvd size case) which cleverly holds six disks - would love to see that case become the new standard for box sets.  Now, the cons.  This isn't the best dvd transfer I've seen.  Picture quality is not that great, tends to be dark and lean towards the red/orange end of the spectrum.  I'm guessing a certain amount of that is intentional in the original.  Also, take into account that we are spoiled in the modern hi-def age... this level of picture quality was once considered ""acceptable"".  Also it may be that this series wasn't highly regarded in it's day and probably wasn't stored under ideal conditions - who would think that 20 years later there would still be diehard fans waiting to watch it on hi-def 21st century tv sets?

All in all, I had a great time watching these stories again, some for the first time (I didn't get the chance to see all the original broadcasts).  The quibbles about picture quality and even audio at times, pale in comparison to the delight I experienced in getting to enjoy the stories of occult mayhem and the quest to recover the cursed objects.  I hope the studio will follow up with a quick release of the remaining seasons on dvd so I can complete the collection.

3154345,4,B00168OILM,"Friday the 13th the Series was one of my favorite shows in the late '80s. It pushed the envelope in terms of what a made for TV horror drama could actually do at that time. I was about 16 years old so of course I'm sure seeing Mickey (Robey) each week was part of the draw. But the Series was more than that. The characters particularly Mickey and Ryan had great chemistry and a nice degree of sexual tension from the beginning. And the visual gore (at the time) had enough shock value to keep you engrossed. The central plot, which had nothing to do with Friday movies, was tight enough to keep viewers coming back each week. The writers were excellent in keeping the drama and suspense at a fever pitch. It was not your traditional good vs evil drama, as a lot of times the ""bad guy"" using the cursed object managed to accomplish what he/she was aiming for. Although he/she paid the price in the end.

With regard to video quality, I was not too disappointed. I viewed this on a Samsung Blu-Ray player that does an excellent job of upconverting standard DVDs. While it is not as crisp as today's quality DVDs, it's not horrible either. I do admit a lot of the scenes in the Curious Goods store are a bit grainy. But all in all for anyone who loved the Series (or the horror genre in general) and searched the blogosphere for *years* for rumors of it's official DVD release, this would make an excellent Christmas gift or stocking stuffer.

Like others, I'm also very disappointed in the transfer quality.  If I'm not mistaken, this show, like many others of that time saved production money by opting for tape over film.  If that's true, the original source material is videotape, thus a less than desired transfer.  Even so, this could have gotten a better treatment, and certainly deserves so for the fans.

I watched the original series and this is comparative to what I watched originally.  People have gotten very spoiled and have forgotten this series is over 20 years old.  If you expect 2008 quality from a series filmed in the late 1980s then you may be disappointed.

3154357,5,B00168OILM,"This was one of the best shows of the 80's. While everyone else was watching all the other dreck on prime time TV I was watching this.

There are many reviews here about the picture quality of this set. I think, for the most part, it looks good. There are many shots on here that really do look bad. Don't let that deter you from buying this set.

This show was meant to be a low budget, late night affair. It's no wonder it was never released on VHS back in the day, so these DVD's are all the sweeter for it. So I never expected this to be some over the top digital remaster with corrected sound and color. It would take away the magic for me. These shows were meant to be a little dirty and unpolished. It adds to the atmosphere of the show. These DVD's are exactly how this show should be presented. A little rough around the edges but not quite in need of repair. I do wish they would have kept the original 30 second opening explaining the premise of the show, but I'm sure they felt it would be repetitious.
What I really miss is the 'coming next week' segments at the end of each show. Only the Quilt Of Hathor episode has Jack explaining what happened the previous week. Hopefully on further releases they'll gather these together.

Until recently I haven't seen any of these shows for 20 years. Back in the day I may have seen them twice, maybe three times and seeing them again made me realize how much I remembered about this show. So this was a good nostalgia trip, if nothing else.

So if you were a fan of his show, buy this thing!",1223251200,4,1546,4.212837837837838

It moves from the ""blood and guts/slasher"" type of horror to a slightly more cerebral and atmospheric sense of terror and shows how description and proper dialogue create the right mood. Yes, like many a young man, I had a crush on Louise Robey, but that was not the only reason to watch the show.
The picture quality on the DVDs has been criticized, but I have yet to encounter any problems. In fact, the quality is probably better than when I was watching it. (Some channels didn't come in too clear with an antenna back then.)
Thank you, CBS, for finally giving in and releasing this series on DVD. Now I just have to wait for the other two season to show up...",1223251200,6,763,4.3426573426573425

3154363,1,B00168OILM,"For the first official DVD release of FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES (UK title: FRIDAY'S CURSE), I was expecting a bit much, I guess.  And seeing the lack of bonus features, though disheartening, I could understand.  Others have already lambasted the picture quality of the set, so I won't go there.  What I *WILL* say is that Paramount had the opportunity to ""do right"" by F13 fans and came up nearly empty.

Where do I begin?  Does everyone who watched in the 1980s remember the ""saga sell"" that started each episode?  ""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to sell cursed antiques...""  It was edited out for airings on Sci-Fi Channel etc.  Well, apparently they didn't have space for it here, either, because that 30-second opening montage is missing.  Whatever happened to ""complete"" episodes?

I would have liked seeing the original ""next week"" promos, or the ""Friday's Curse"" alternate tites.  What we have here is nothing short of insulting--a total of 40-odd seconds of 2 promos with the trademark F13 headstone erupting out of the ground, and a brief sales promotion.  Who was really clamoring for these non-bonuses?

Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but I was hoping for more.  Everyone, send a letter to Paramount and tell them how shafted you feel by every aspect of this set, and urge them to do better with Season Two (which probably won't even be complete because of Vanity's urging that the episode ""Mesmer's Bauble"" not be transmitted in the U.S., which will hamper music rights).

Sad, Paramount, very sad.  Shame on you!

3154364,3,B00168OILM,"I have been waiting patiently for many, many years for Paramount to bring this series to DVD.  I pre-ordered early as soon as Amazon listed it, and waited patiently.  What I got was sheer disappointment.
Shame on you, Paramount!  You gave us a shoddy product with high end pricing.  Don't get me wrong, the packaging is clever (I especially like all 6 DVDs in a single-disc size case) But the artwork (or lack thereof) is pathetic.  My eight year old could do better with his crayons and a magazine.  The Picture Quality is no better than my twenty year old VHS copies I recorded from C-Band Satellite (Which even has more special features, promos, than this DVD release!) There has been no remastering for the Video or sound.  Turn the volume way up because the mono soundtrack leaves a lot to be wanted. (My old VHS are even STEREO sound . . . go figure?)
I am overall very disappointed with the product that Paramount has given us long time fans.  Shame on you, Paramount! We would have been so much better off if someone like Anchor Bay got the rights.  At least we could have expected a remastered picture and sound.

The video quality is abysmal. It looks as if someone taped the episodes from a (non-digital) TV broadcast onto VHS, and then transferred the VHS onto a DVD. I've seen a bootleg version of the series that was taped during a F13th marathon and it was no worse than these DVDs. The images are grainy and fuzzy and the colors are faded, imprecise, and far too dark. I have shows on DVD that were taped in the 1950s and the images are crisp and the colors vibrant.

Fans will still want this because there are no options, but CBS Studios and Paramount should hang their heads in shame at this blatant display of incompetence and disregard for quality.",1222214400,88,939,4.550295857988166

3154373,5,B00168OILM,"A beloved cult series from the minute it debuted, Friday the 13th: The Series was not based or tied into the long running series of slasher films featuring Jason Voorhees, but instead was a Hitchcockian-style supernatural series that featured some truly horrifying moments to behold.  Cousins Micki (Louise Robey) and Ryan (John D. LeMay, who would actually go on to star in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday) come to inherit an antiques shop from their uncle (who had made a deal with the devil), only to learn that the shop's antiques are cursed.  Eventually, they meet the knowledgable Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins) who assists the cousins in tracking down the objects over the course of this debut season.  What really helped Friday the 13th: The Series so great was the atmosphere that the show managed to conjure on a consistent basis.  The stories may seem kind of cliche as the season opens, but there are some inventive twists and creepy turns that will definitely hold your interest.  Guest stars on this first season included R.G. Armstrong (as the cousin's late uncle) and an 8-year old Sarah Polley (both in the pilot episode), as well as Ray Walston, Carrie Snodgress, David Proval, and Postal's Zack Ward; and also featured horror great David Cronenberg helming the excellent episode ""Faith Healer"" to boot.  All in all, it's nice to finally have Friday the 13th: The Series on DVD, although it would have been nice if Paramount would have included some sort of extras on the set.  Still, Friday the 13th: The Series is finally here, and it is still definitely worth adding to your collection.",1218672000,16,1610,4.854014598540146

  When I tell horror fans about it today, very few can recall it. I can remember many stories from the series including the vampire's cape, cupid's arrow, etc...
  I'm only giving the DVD 4 stars since I read today that there are no extra features.

Add to that the stinkers that HAVE been release on DVD and it made the situation extra perplexing!

So I was thrilled to see that, after years of waiting, F13 the series will finally be released on DVD!!  My best friend and I have been watching the show since it originally aired in 1987, when we were 10 years old!  In fact, we were obsessed enough with the show to maintain a website about it 20 years later! :-D

The plot goes something like this: Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to get rich by selling cursed antiques.  After breaking the pact with the devil, he is killed, and Micki and Ryan inherit the store.  They don't know about its accursed past, or the cursed antiques in the downstairs vault.  Consequently, they sell off most of the vault's contents before finally discovering the awful truth.  Once the dark secret revealed by Jack Marshack, Lewis Vendredi's old friend, the trio sets out to collect all of the cursed antiques and put them back into the vault where they cannot harm anyone ever again.

The show follows the lives of Micki, Ryan, Jack, and (primarily in Season 3) Johnny as they attempt to hunt down cursed antiques.  It is a weird and fantastic show that is fun, campy, and creepy all at the same time! The characters are great together, the plots are generally really imaginative, and it is easy to get sucked into the atmosphere! Happy viewing fellow fans!

3388669,5,B00168OILM,I watched this show when it originally aired and thought it was a terrific show saddled by a terrible title because it had nothing to do with the movie series - except that Paramount owned the title.  The series has been airing on the Chiller channel for a while - probably in edited format and missing an episode or two from syndication - and the DVD release is long overdue.  Every fan needs to pick this set up and non-fans should consider giving it a try.  It's got some 80s cheese-tastic episodes but there are some really great episodes as well.  This long-awaited release is worth the price.,1211500800,3,598,4.5092592592592595

3388671,5,B00168OILM,"Unfortunately the title made people believe that this had something to do with Jason, promiscuous teenagers, and Camp Crystal Lake.  In truth, it had absolutely nothing to do with it.

This Canadian-made suspense drama's plot consisted of an antique dealer who made a deal with Satan to sell cursed artifacts.  The artifacts all brought the bearer some great benefit, but at a terrible price.  When his conscience  finally caught up with him, however, the devil turned on him and captured his soul.  His co-worker, along with his nephew and his cousin (played by Robey - one of the hottest redheads to ever grace our TV screens), set out to reclaim all the artifacts and return them to a secured and consecrated vaults where the artifacts can do no more harm.

Each episode deals with the team trying to reclaim a new artifact.  There are some truly incredible moments of drama in this series showing how people can be seduced by evil, even though they have the purest hearts or intentions.

Seasons 1 & 2 are incredible, and the finale to season 2 blew me away more than any episode of any TV show.  Season 3 saw the departure of one of the lead characters, which many see as the ""Jump The Shark"" moment, but the other two characters and the new actor still do an admirable job after loosing a key character.

The whole series is available elsewhere online - just do a search and you can find the whole collection, region-free, for under $50.  It's well worth it for any sci-fi, suspense, or horror fans.  (FYI - The show is not gory - it gets its impact from a very Hitchcock-like use of lighting and misdirection).

3388705,2,B00168OILM,"UPDATE: My original review is below but I had to add one more comment that knocked this product down from a four-star to a two-star rating. In my first review I explain why the picture quality of this show isn't as good as it could be. However, after recently watching a few of the episodes, I realize that the image quality varies drastically from episode to episode. One episode will be okay (the best review ANY episode's visuals will get from me) while the next will be close to looking like a worn VHS. There is no legit excuse for this save that the original masters were mishandled, not stored properly or destroyed and they had to use back-ups. There is no way these episodes aired in the 80s looking like this. There are episodes I can't watch all the way through due to how bad the image is. Such a waste.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: My four star rating is for the series itself, not the release. I, like many others, am disappointed in the picture quality of the episodes. Many have posted on here that they have seen broadcasts and recorded VHS tapes that looked better. While I cannot comment on that, I can explain the core reason why the release looks the way it does and why we many never get a better one.

Back in the 80s when TV syndication started becoming a popular means of getting TV shows to the masses, many studios were trying to capitalize on their properties as well as find the cheapest way to produce them. Paramount created Star Trek: The Next Generation and Friday the 13th: The Series to do just this. Both were shot on film but then the raw footage was transferred, edited and (this is key) mastered on videotape. What this means is that no matter how the shows are seen (broadcast, DVD or even transferred in HD), they will have to be taken from an SD tape master. The only way to get a pristine picture is to go back to the raw film footage, transfer that to HD and then re-edit the entire series. This is a monstrous undertaking (pardon the pun) and only a series with a large fan-base would have any hope of getting this treatment (as Star Trek: The Next Generation has enjoyed over the last couple of years--Netflix now has it in Blu Ray quality and it is much better than the blurry HD they were showing).

I will agree that the DVDs of F13: The Series looks even shoddier than the explanation above can justify. It appears that the episodes were taken from copies of masters rather than from the master tapes themselves. However, if anyone out there is thinking there will eventually be a release of F13: The Series in a crystal-clear Blu Ray edition you may want to temper those hopes a little. Unfortunately, no one in the 80s could have imagined there would be anything close to HD and did not use the time or money to prepare their shows for it.

I'm glad I bought this DVD set and will enjoy it for what it is: a fond look back on a show that gave me chills growing up.",1452556800,,2905,4.364140480591497

3388710,5,B00168OILM,"When FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES debuted in 1987 it wasn't exactly bright on my radar. I was aware of it, and even saw an episode I thought was very good (""Doctor Jack""), but until recently I'd forgotten the show ever existed. When a friend of mine mentioned it recently in passing, I had a sudden, inexplicable desire to buy the first season on the spot, and so I did...and boy am I glad, because I haven't had this much fun with a TV show in a long, long time.

FRIDAY THE 13TH was produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., the same guy who brought us the notorious slasher films of the same name, so you could be forgiven if you thought this was a biopic of Jason Voorhees set in Crystal Lake. Actually it has nothing to do with the hockey-masked killer, but is an entirely different story, albeit very much in the horror vein. Here goes:

Lewis Vendredi (R.G. Armstrong) made a pact with the devil. In return for wealth and immortality, he agreed to sell to the unwary customers of his antique shop items which had been cursed by Satan. When Vendredi tried to go back on the pact, he is sent to hell and the shop was left to his neice Micki Foster (Louise Robey), and her cousin by marriage Ryan Dallion (John D. LeMay). The two clueless relations are quickly educated as the true nature of the store's stock by a former business partner of Vandredi's named Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins), who had no idea the items he was selling Lewis were being used in such an evil manner until it was too late. Renaming the shop Curious Goods, the three of them set out to recover each of the more than 200 cursed items in circulation and place them in safekeeping so that they can do no more damage. This is easier said than done, of course, as each object carries a different curse -- and therefore a different danger.

I should probably start by addressing the show's three principal faults to get them out of the way. First, and especially during the early episodes, the budget for F13 was obviously very low, which affected every aspect of the production, an affect heightened for the modern viewer by the now horribly-dated special effects. Second, also most notably in the early going, the acting and writing are wildly inconsistent, with Robey tending to over-emote and DeMay tending to deliver the nervous, uncertain performance of a young actor out of his depth.  Last, the style in which the series is executed is very portentous, with a lot of awkward moments: weak cliffhangers, bad jokes, and cheesy melodrama. When the show is bad, it's very bad indeed.

Having said that, this is a series that gleefully transcends its faults, and not merely because as the season wore on, the budget clearly increased -- even to the point of getting David Cronenberg as a guest director. Yes, many of the flaws were ironed out, and the episodes in the later seasons had flashy cinematography, better character actors for backup, and an ambitiously large scope; but the reason I found it so compulsively watchable was because it foreshadowed many of the characteristics which were to make shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, SUPERNATURAL and FRINGE so popular in later years. It combines surprisingly bloody and gruesome horror with sharp and seditious wit, whilie utilizing a family-style dynamic among the cast, and backing up a good-size truck of sexual tension in the bargain. Jack is the wise but somewhat enigmatic father-figure with the shadowy past; Micki is surefooted and responsible but restraining great passions; Ryan is the immature slacker coming to grips with manhood and destiny. Together they produce that chemistry and likeability that ever show strives for but very few achieve. Just as importantly, this is a horror show that really delivers the goods. The curses are full of terrible irony, the villains diverse in their villainy, and the killings are grisly and, considering the time period, extremely graphic and long-winded: you'll see people burned alive, electrocuted, riddled with bullets, stabbed, impaled, beheaded, and in one case, drowned in a toilet. And going beyond this, and despite its humor, FRIDAY was a not a series which was afraid of unhappy endings. Some of the quests were less successful than others, and as the season wore on, each of the characters suffered a terrible, personal loss which made them question whether they wanted to continue fighting the good fight.

A few of my favorite episodes:

""Cupid's Quiver"" -- A cursed cupid doll becomes a collegiate loser's ticket to love, with the caveat that every woman he seduces must be murdered afterward. Some great acting by Denis Forest as the bad guy.

""A Cup of Time"" -- A female rock star uses a cursed cup to remain young. Nice twists in this plot, as well as some great 80s rock 'n roll ""fashion.""

""Doctor Jack"" -- A wonderfully atmospheric episode about a mediocre doctor who obtains Jack the Ripper's scalpel and becomes a world-class surgeon, the catch being that the scalpel must be ""fed"" with a murder after every operation.

""Scarecrow"" -- The gang tackles a woman whose scarecrow promises a superb harvest...provided it gets to collect three heads per growing season.

""Faith Healer"" -- directed by David Cronenberg, this one features a glove which can transfer disease or injury from one person to another: a startlingly brutal episode with some very Cronenberg-like gore.

""Vanity's Mirror"" -- A cursed compact gives a homely, bitter high school girl an opportunity to get even with her tormentors and snag the man of her dreams: her sister's boyfriend.

""Tattoo"" -- In trouble with the mob, a hotheaded loser from Chinatown acquires tattoo needles that exchange luck at the card table for human lives.

""The Quilt of Hathor"" -- In this two-part episode, Ryan and Micki infiltrate an Amish-type sect being torn apart by a cursed quilt that grants the darkest dreams of anyone who sleeps beneath it.

""Double Exposure"" - The guys bang heads with an amoral reporter who uses a cursed camera to commit serial murders.

""The Pirate's Promise"" - Taking a page out of THE FOG, this one involves a cursed foghorn, the ghost of a pirate, and a hit list 200 years old.

""What A Mother Wouldn't Do"" -- One of the most brutal stories, about an antique crib which demands seven lives in return for restoring a terminally ill baby's health.

As I said, FRIDAY is a series with many, many flaws, but at the same time I found it compulsively watchable and a great deal of fun. It not only delivers the sort of old-school horror-movie atmosphere I greatly enjoy, it clearly had an enormous influence, directly or indirectly, on people like Chris Carter, Joss Whedon, Tim Kring, David Greenwalt, and others who enjoyed considerably more pop-culture fame. I'm a bit mystified as to how I didn't start watching this in high school...but better a quarter century late than never, right?",1429660800,3,6881,4.797297297297297

Episodes directed by Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg are both in this first season.

3388760,5,B00168OILM,"Friday the 13th the series is one of those shows that when I first heard about it coming to TV way back in the 1980s I was like, what the...?! How is a show based on Jason Voorhees going to work on a weekly basis? It would get old really fast. Then more details started to emerge about the plot synopsis...""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to sell cursed antiques..."" And, well, you all know the drill--turned out the show had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the psycho slasher films starring ol' hockey mask-faced Jason Voorhees after all. And then I thought to myself, What a great concept for a TV series! And so it was. From the start I watched it weekly and quickly became a fan.

Fast forward all these years later and here I am watching these now classic episodes on DVD and they are just as great as I remember them to be. It's great to finally be able to see this show again featuring favorite characters such as Ryan, Micki, and Jack Marshak, played wonderfully by the great John D. Lemay, Louise Robey, and Chris Wiggins. It feels like being reunited with long lost friends again.

As others have mentioned before in previous reviews, there is something to be desired with the picture quality, it's not as good as it could be. Actually, it's not really all that bad and some episodes look much better than others, but for the most part the quality is passable, and for the price that I paid, more than acceptable enough to be able to revisit this old series.

The series takes off with quality acting, stories, and special effects. How they got away with some of the violence is incredible.

Besides the regulars, Friday was also adept at reusing some of the guest stars. For example, the girl in the story of the compact also plays a different character in a story of a stop watch. A farmer in the scarecrow story plays a doctor in the Indian rattle story. The low IQ guy in the ""Brain Drain"" episode also played in the sport ring episode. There are numerous others who played different characters throught the series run.

3388793,3,B00168OILM,"Pens, dolls, scalpels, boxing gloves, vanity mirrors, strange looking quilts, and just for good measure a defunct electric chair! Things most anyone could find at a garage sale or local flea market, or if you happen to reside near a cursed antique shop owned by Lewis Vandredi. And, since these items from Mr. Vandredi come with the bonus of having been cursed exclusively by the Devil himself, you also get the unwelcomed element of death waiting for you to turn your back on them as well!

Enter our lucky trio consisting of young and rebellious Ryan Dallion (John D. Lemay), his beautiful, high-maintenance cousin Micki Foster (Louise Robey billed simply as Robey) and the wise-old sage and once close friend of Mr. Vandredi, Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins) (whom offers his knowledge of the occult and whom is often a key factor in their surviving the various deadly situations they find themselves struggling against) who are attempting to retrieve Uncle Lewis' cursed odds and ends, where they can be securely entrusted in the store's basement vault and away from the perverse temptations of the outside world.

Risking being dismissed as a complete goof, F13TS manages to maintain a fine line between credibility and being entirely heedless. Most season one episodes keep the show on due course and manages to be, if not engaging, at least mildly entertaining and inventive. In defense of the seemingly sophomoric teleplays that enfold, the series is low budget at best and shot entirely in Canada, using mostly a Canadian cast and crew. All the while, trying to play itself off as taking place in America. There are faults in this attempt (mostly landmarks and signs which are a constant enemy of location shooting) most of which do not detract the viewer's attention. But, for those of us whom are blessed (or cursed depending upon one's point-of-view) with the ability to pinpoint a mistake in continuity or geographical location within the passing of a film frame or two, these blemishes only go to prove that the show was done quickly and on a shoestring budget and seems to carry about it the constant threat of being axed at any slip of a ratings point! And, while it did manage to thrive for three seasons, most fans revel in the 1st and 2nd seasons in which the character of Ryan was still present. Sadly, Mr. Lemay eventually pursued other interests and thus, the premature fate of the series was set in motion

Having nothing to do with the highly popular and successful film franchise bearing the exact name (something of a major disappointment to `Friday' fans, myself included) the series instead focuses on the hunting down and obtaining of cursed objects sold by Uncle Lewis (Ryan and Micki unknowingly contributed to this debacle when after having just inherited Lewis' antique store (after his bizarre death) they immediately began to sell everything off in the hopes of making a quick buck and getting out of dodge without too much disruption to their personal lives; of which none of the aforementioned happened much to their chagrin) rather than of having anything to do with the big, clumsy, hockey-masked sporting kid named Jason who excels in chopping people up with his oversized machete.

And just as each item is unique as the next, so is the curse that belongs to it. Specifics are not important here as discovering what the item does and how it dispatches its victims is half of the fun! Here's just a few of the primo episodes that make up this 1st season: `The Inheritance', `A Cup of Time', `Hellowe'en', `Doctor Jack', `Root of all Evil', `Faith Healer', The Electrocutioner', `The Quilt of Hathor', `Double Exposure'(as close to Jason Voorhees as one will get in the first season),'The Pirate's Promise', and `What a Mother Wouldn't Do'. Of the 26 season one episodes, the aforementioned are the cr&egrave;me du lay and as the first season draws to an close, we witness it's gradual, yet persistent climb in production value and in the care taken providing stories that are both graphically enlightening and imaginatively unique, while ensuring that our protagonists remain interesting and continue to develop both as a trio, as well as individually. A certain challenge for a series that cost around $500,00 an episode and which became the target of infuriated viewers displeased with the amount of onscreen violence and gore that, for it's time, was running comfortably alongside with many of the R-rated horror films of it's day.

F13TS' look does little to impress. Respectively shot in its original television 1.33:1 aspect ratio, most of the episodes are filled with film grain (the later few discs seem not to have inherited quite so much--of which I question either the transfer of the first few episodes or perhaps as the series grew in popularity, so did the quality of photography?), and colors are often muted and sometimes murky. Though, the series presented here on DVD is an improvement over the original broadcasts, this is far from showroom material. Then, again, were you really expecting `reference' showroom material from a low-budget 80's TV show?

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital Mono and is efficient in delivering clear dialogue. No surrounds. No booming base.

Extras are slim: two original network launch promotional trailers which tally up to 44 seconds worth of material. A ten minute sales presentation sums up the extras department and is nothing more than the various episodes fashioned in montage style and voiced-over by the late Don LaFontaine.

Television history may or may not have taken notice of the `little engine that could' that is `Friday the 13th: the Series', but for those viewers who have come to embrace it over the years the series (""cheese"" factor and all!) still remains a guilty treat filled with hidden dangers, of which we can't help but indulge in anyway. And, I promise if you purchase it you won't get more than what you bargained for!

The gorgeous redhead Robey is still here with her castmates John D. Le May and Chris Wiggins as they try and track down those cursed antiques. For those of you who never saw the show when it first came out in the late eighties, it has nothing to do with Jason and the movie franchise. They deal with Jack the Ripper's surgical scalpel, a vicious doll, tattoo needles, and a variety of other items. See it if you get the chance.",1247616000,5,600,4.366071428571429

3388799,5,B00168OILM,"Except for the ridiculous episode where Ryan and Micki infiltrate a Catholic Church looking for a pen, this whole first season was outstanding!  My wife and I crack up at that Church episode because, when they go to the basement of the church, naturally there's a guillotine! LOL... We Catholics always have guillotines at the bottom of our churches, just in case we decide to have a last-minute inquisition! LOL puhllleeze! lol

I forgot actually how BOLD this series was horror-wise for its time. That episode ""Root of all Evil"" where that crazy mutha throws people into a yard shreader and money comes out!?....wowzers! That was gory and all-out creepy! I can't believe they even got that one on TV! lol

Another over-the-top creepy and YET HILARIOUS episode was ""The Electrocutioner.""  A dentist using a cursed electric chair!? Now that's definitely worth signing-on for!

My favorite episodes were: ""The Quilt of Hathor I and II,"" ""Vanity's Mirror,"" ""A Cup of Time,"" ""Bedazzled"" etc.

As interesting an episode as it was, ""The Baron's Bride"" was pretty weird. I like the way our heroes show up at the beginning of the episode to claim a cursed cape only to find out it's in the hands of a vampire. Now what are those odds! Then we get a Jack the Ripper plot to boot! LOL

This series was so much fun, so bold, and the characters were neat. Ryan is quirky and fun, Micki is hot as blazes, Jack is like the uncle you always wanted, and Uncle Lewis is an all-out wackoboy! The haunted antiques/items are downright creepy and clever.

The DVD quality is a tad grainy and most definitely NOT perfect. But as other posters have stated, this was the 80's and the quality at the time. I remember watching this show at midnight after my parents went to bed as a junior high kid. It was a tad grainy and surely not HD lol but it works for me....Don't let a little imperfection snobbery keep you from watching a classic show!

to stay awake long enough to catch this show on Friday nights , only to fall asleep just before it started ( Hey , I was 12 ! ) .

3388813,2,B00168OILM,"I love a good fright  as well as I am sure a lot of others out there as well. Heck I even like a good slasher fick as well but this is not what this review is about. There are Great ways to do a Horror/Sci Fi Show and then there is this series which is most cerainly not. Yes all of these series will have some kind of cheese factor, cliches, and over acting and this FT13TS sad to say had way too much. The sign of a great series is if can be believable and frightening with out having to go to the gore / gross out factor- it is called using the imagination (remember Hitchcock..anyone??) which this series tried to do but failed on so many levels. Running thru the forrest with a tea cup over your head to keep it from the bad guy, or taking a white glove (  ooohhh...dont let him touch you!!) away from a faith healer or even taking a muppet like talking doll away from a little girl episode. ( even Chucky would hate this one!!) Dont even get started on the vampire episode which is so lame it is truly sad and their theory on just how was dracula written- Dont ask you just might gag. Yes, the the gag reflex is off the charts on this- when something is so bad you double over in agony just wishing it was over. This series is not scary or packs any thrills in any sence of the imagination. This series comes accross as a badly acted comedy. It tries too hard and falls flat. It simply does not deliver the chills or thrills or any thing for that matter. The series had great potential but was destroyed by poor writing, Cheezy story lines (aka lack of imagination), unbeilevably silly situations, really  and I mean REALLY bad acting, and the direction was lame as well as the picture quality of this series. Well some will say well this was done in the Mid 1980's and didn't have much to work with and My reply will be well then if you want to see how a really good series is done all you have to do is to go back into the late 60's and 1970's -years before this disaster was made and see two of the most influential series ( thet eventually inspired shows like Tales From the Crypt, Buffy, Angel, Charmed and a few others) those shows were Dark Shadows and The Night Stalker (No not the new one - they butchered that one as well) These series were told in 45 min or less (except for the movies) they had a great formula, story writing/lines, acting, atmosphers, great music, again no gore/ gross out needed. You set the situation up right with atmosphere, great story telling, supurb music, acting , direction and use of camera angles and set up-  add some cheese factor and cliches and what you get was a great laugh followed by a truly thrilling & chilling jump out of your seat experience.  Evey thing that FT13TS lacks on every level. It was so painful to watch I could just get to the middle of the first season before I had to turn it off. I truly could not pick one good episode from the bunch- not one. I truly am suprised by the ""rave"" reviews this recieved. Maybe for Nostalgia sake , but that cant even save the series. I grew up with all of these series and remember this being on TV so when I saw this come out and the reviews I thought well lets give it a try- in what should have been a fun blast truned into a real disappointment, unbearable to watch & a even quicker trip to trade it in. With ""older series like that were released like- Night Gallery, Twilight Zone, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker etc- when they came out on dvd the picture and sound was sharp , crisp and well done. Who ever got hold of this sad series to begin with didn't even bother to clean it up which just adds to the complete disaster that it already is.  The idea was there- but it simply didn't have anything going for it poorly executed in every way. What could have been great just  ends up like a big wet thud. If you like way over the top poorly acted, scripted  and way too cheezy (like Ed Wood movies) you may want to take a peek at this. Other wise if you are looking for a reasonably intelligent and classic series like the ones previously mentioned-you definately want to stay far away from this or you will be looking to off load this dvd at a trade in store with in a week you start watching it. There are just some things that should remain buried and Friday the 13th The Series is sure one of them. Ugh! What a mess.",1236643200,,4329,4.182254196642686

Some of you have mentioned that Twin Peaks is amazing restoration - it is because it was shot and edited on film.

Extras: Series one DVD box has some promo trailers. I personally hadn't seen them before, but actually was expecting some interviews or behind the scenes material.

Summary:
For a real fan, the DVD is  a sure buy. But if you already own a set of VCR tapes or DVD's (no matter if you bought them or made them yourself), you might have a problem arguing why you really need this product.

As is often with dated sci-fi material some of the ""special effects"" seem corny to modern standards, yet the inferred drama & suspense techniques (plus excellent musical scores) more than make up to sustain the story line.  for a classic sci-fi thriller series, providing a plethora of variety on a common theme.

I have waited years and so many times I came close to purchasing bootleg versions - glad I did not because now I have heard of identity theft problems involving those bootleg sellers.  Thanks very much to the studio for finally releasing it, longtime fans such as myself are grateful without a doubt.

I recently completed viewing the entire 1st season set.  First, the pro's.  The episodes are on a menu, that's great because I've heard some series like the new Sarah Connor series are not.  All of the disks played without any issues - also, something that is not universally guaranteed, since I've had tvdvd disks that were bad (wouldn't play or some episodes had glitches).  No problems at all with the playback.  I like the thin-style case (regular dvd size case) which cleverly holds six disks - would love to see that case become the new standard for box sets.  Now, the cons.  This isn't the best dvd transfer I've seen.  Picture quality is not that great, tends to be dark and lean towards the red/orange end of the spectrum.  I'm guessing a certain amount of that is intentional in the original.  Also, take into account that we are spoiled in the modern hi-def age... this level of picture quality was once considered ""acceptable"".  Also it may be that this series wasn't highly regarded in it's day and probably wasn't stored under ideal conditions - who would think that 20 years later there would still be diehard fans waiting to watch it on hi-def 21st century tv sets?

All in all, I had a great time watching these stories again, some for the first time (I didn't get the chance to see all the original broadcasts).  The quibbles about picture quality and even audio at times, pale in comparison to the delight I experienced in getting to enjoy the stories of occult mayhem and the quest to recover the cursed objects.  I hope the studio will follow up with a quick release of the remaining seasons on dvd so I can complete the collection.  But in doing so, I hope there will be time and money to devote to improving the quality as much as humanly possible.

Some of the scenes are a little dark and grainy, but it doesn't distract from the show. Well, not to me anyway. As for the extras, that is a bit disappointing. How hard is it to add some extras? Lazy bums. My greatest fear with this DVD release, is that CBS won't release the rest of the series because ...""we didn't make enough money off it. Wah!"" Thats what I
think happened with Disney and Gargoyles Season 2 vol. 2.

3388842,4,B00168OILM,"Friday the 13th the Series was one of my favorite shows in the late '80s. It pushed the envelope in terms of what a made for TV horror drama could actually do at that time. I was about 16 years old so of course I'm sure seeing Mickey (Robey) each week was part of the draw. But the Series was more than that. The characters particularly Mickey and Ryan had great chemistry and a nice degree of sexual tension from the beginning. And the visual gore (at the time) had enough shock value to keep you engrossed. The central plot, which had nothing to do with Friday movies, was tight enough to keep viewers coming back each week. The writers were excellent in keeping the drama and suspense at a fever pitch. It was not your traditional good vs evil drama, as a lot of times the ""bad guy"" using the cursed object managed to accomplish what he/she was aiming for. Although he/she paid the price in the end.

With regard to video quality, I was not too disappointed. I viewed this on a Samsung Blu-Ray player that does an excellent job of upconverting standard DVDs. While it is not as crisp as today's quality DVDs, it's not horrible either. I do admit a lot of the scenes in the Curious Goods store are a bit grainy. But all in all for anyone who loved the Series (or the horror genre in general) and searched the blogosphere for *years* for rumors of it's official DVD release, this would make an excellent Christmas gift or stocking stuffer.

3388852,4,B00168OILM,"Friday the 13th the series isn't for everyone, but for those who remember fondly staying up late Saturday nights for this fun piece of cheese, it's great to finally have it on disk.  Like others, I'm also very disappointed in the transfer quality.  If I'm not mistaken, this show, like many others of that time saved production money by opting for tape over film.  If that's true, the original source material is videotape, thus a less than desired transfer.  Even so, this could have gotten a better treatment, and certainly deserves so for the fans.  Aside from quality issues, I am absolutely enjoying watching these again.  Bring on season two.",1223510400,5,648,4.845454545454546
3388853,5,B00168OILM,I found the quality of this set to be fine!  I bought it expecting the quality to be poor and did not find that to be the case at all.  I watched the original series and this is comparative to what I watched originally.  People have gotten very spoiled and have forgotten this series is over 20 years old.  If you expect 2008 quality from a series filmed in the late 1980s then you may be disappointed.  If you are realistic and have waited as long as I have for this to come out you will be ecstatic.,1223337600,4,501,4.071428571428571
3388854,5,B00168OILM,"This was one of the best shows of the 80's. While everyone else was watching all the other dreck on prime time TV I was watching this.

There are many reviews here about the picture quality of this set. I think, for the most part, it looks good. There are many shots on here that really do look bad. Don't let that deter you from buying this set.

This show was meant to be a low budget, late night affair. It's no wonder it was never released on VHS back in the day, so these DVD's are all the sweeter for it. So I never expected this to be some over the top digital remaster with corrected sound and color. It would take away the magic for me. These shows were meant to be a little dirty and unpolished. It adds to the atmosphere of the show. These DVD's are exactly how this show should be presented. A little rough around the edges but not quite in need of repair. I do wish they would have kept the original 30 second opening explaining the premise of the show, but I'm sure they felt it would be repetitious.
What I really miss is the 'coming next week' segments at the end of each show. Only the Quilt Of Hathor episode has Jack explaining what happened the previous week. Hopefully on further releases they'll gather these together.

Until recently I haven't seen any of these shows for 20 years. Back in the day I may have seen them twice, maybe three times and seeing them again made me realize how much I remembered about this show. So this was a good nostalgia trip, if nothing else.

So if you were a fan of his show, buy this thing!",1223251200,4,1546,4.212837837837838
3388855,5,B00168OILM,"This was one of my favorite shows when I was growing up, and it shaped my love of horror-suspense. It moves from the ""blood and guts/slasher"" type of horror to a slightly more cerebral and atmospheric sense of terror and shows how description and proper dialogue create the right mood. Yes, like many a young man, I had a crush on Louise Robey, but that was not the only reason to watch the show.
The picture quality on the DVDs has been criticized, but I have yet to encounter any problems. In fact, the quality is probably better than when I was watching it. (Some channels didn't come in too clear with an antenna back then.)
Thank you, CBS, for finally giving in and releasing this series on DVD. Now I just have to wait for the other two season to show up...",1223251200,6,763,4.3426573426573425

Also people have complained about it being ""too dark"" in spots, but I really didn't see any problem with that.  I even watched it on a HD tv, and it wasn't in HD, but it still looked pretty nice!

3388860,1,B00168OILM,"For the first official DVD release of FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES (UK title: FRIDAY'S CURSE), I was expecting a bit much, I guess.  And seeing the lack of bonus features, though disheartening, I could understand.  Others have already lambasted the picture quality of the set, so I won't go there.  What I *WILL* say is that Paramount had the opportunity to ""do right"" by F13 fans and came up nearly empty.

Where do I begin?  Does everyone who watched in the 1980s remember the ""saga sell"" that started each episode?  ""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to sell cursed antiques...""  It was edited out for airings on Sci-Fi Channel etc.  Well, apparently they didn't have space for it here, either, because that 30-second opening montage is missing.  Whatever happened to ""complete"" episodes?

I would have liked seeing the original ""next week"" promos, or the ""Friday's Curse"" alternate tites.  What we have here is nothing short of insulting--a total of 40-odd seconds of 2 promos with the trademark F13 headstone erupting out of the ground, and a brief sales promotion.  Who was really clamoring for these non-bonuses?

Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but I was hoping for more.  Everyone, send a letter to Paramount and tell them how shafted you feel by every aspect of this set, and urge them to do better with Season Two (which probably won't even be complete because of Vanity's urging that the episode ""Mesmer's Bauble"" not be transmitted in the U.S., which will hamper music rights).

Sad, Paramount, very sad.  Shame on you!

3388861,3,B00168OILM,"I have been waiting patiently for many, many years for Paramount to bring this series to DVD.  I pre-ordered early as soon as Amazon listed it, and waited patiently.  What I got was sheer disappointment.
Shame on you, Paramount!  You gave us a shoddy product with high end pricing.  Don't get me wrong, the packaging is clever (I especially like all 6 DVDs in a single-disc size case) But the artwork (or lack thereof) is pathetic.  My eight year old could do better with his crayons and a magazine.  The Picture Quality is no better than my twenty year old VHS copies I recorded from C-Band Satellite (Which even has more special features, promos, than this DVD release!) There has been no remastering for the Video or sound.  Turn the volume way up because the mono soundtrack leaves a lot to be wanted. (My old VHS are even STEREO sound . . . go figure?)
I am overall very disappointed with the product that Paramount has given us long time fans.  Shame on you, Paramount! We would have been so much better off if someone like Anchor Bay got the rights.  At least we could have expected a remastered picture and sound.

The video quality is abysmal. It looks as if someone taped the episodes from a (non-digital) TV broadcast onto VHS, and then transferred the VHS onto a DVD. I've seen a bootleg version of the series that was taped during a F13th marathon and it was no worse than these DVDs. The images are grainy and fuzzy and the colors are faded, imprecise, and far too dark. I have shows on DVD that were taped in the 1950s and the images are crisp and the colors vibrant. There's just no excuse for shoddy work like this.

Fans will still want this because there are no options, but CBS Studios and Paramount should hang their heads in shame at this blatant display of incompetence and disregard for quality.",1222214400,88,939,4.550295857988166

3388870,5,B00168OILM,"A beloved cult series from the minute it debuted, Friday the 13th: The Series was not based or tied into the long running series of slasher films featuring Jason Voorhees, but instead was a Hitchcockian-style supernatural series that featured some truly horrifying moments to behold.  Cousins Micki (Louise Robey) and Ryan (John D. LeMay, who would actually go on to star in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday) come to inherit an antiques shop from their uncle (who had made a deal with the devil), only to learn that the shop's antiques are cursed.  Eventually, they meet the knowledgable Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins) who assists the cousins in tracking down the objects over the course of this debut season.  What really helped Friday the 13th: The Series so great was the atmosphere that the show managed to conjure on a consistent basis.  The stories may seem kind of cliche as the season opens, but there are some inventive twists and creepy turns that will definitely hold your interest.  Guest stars on this first season included R.G. Armstrong (as the cousin's late uncle) and an 8-year old Sarah Polley (both in the pilot episode), as well as Ray Walston, Carrie Snodgress, David Proval, and Postal's Zack Ward; and also featured horror great David Cronenberg helming the excellent episode ""Faith Healer"" to boot.  All in all, it's nice to finally have Friday the 13th: The Series on DVD, although it would have been nice if Paramount would have included some sort of extras on the set.  Still, Friday the 13th: The Series is finally here, and it is still definitely worth adding to your collection.",1218672000,16,1610,4.854014598540146
3388871,4,B00168OILM,"Friday the 13th was an innovator for its time. It pre-dated such series as Tales from the Darkside, Tales from Crypt, and Freddy's Nightmares.

  When I tell horror fans about it today, very few can recall it. I can remember many stories from the series including the vampire's cape, cupid's arrow, etc...
  I'm only giving the DVD 4 stars since I read today that there are no extra features. After twenty years you would think they could at least do one or two featurettes with cast, or some commentary tracks. I also will miss not having the teasers for each episode.

8261601,3,B00168OILM,"My review is mainly about the picture quality of the DVD. Other people have reviewed the show itself on this forum and I agree with most of them, great 80s cheesy fun. Other fans of this show have correctly explained why this looks so bad on modern HD TV's. 1980s shows like this and Star trek: The Next Generation (and it's spin-offs, Deep Space Nine and Voyager), Tales from the Darkside, among others, were shot on film, then edited on video tape. Analog video tape does not transfer well to Hi Def as film can. For ST:TNG, CBS went back to the original film negatives, re-edited it with new HD special effects and titles and released it on Blu-Ray and DVD. The results were great, unfortunately, they didn't sell as well as they thought they would. Which put the remaster process for ST:DS9 and ST:V on indefinite hold (or never). I believe they don't think it would be worth the time and money to do the same for Friday the 13th, so we will probably never see this in HD. When I first got this DVD, I still had a old school square standard def CRT TV, and the picture looked pretty good, but when I updated to HD, I realized how bad the picture was. I still collect Blu-Ray and DVDs of my favorite shows, most people prefer streaming to get theirs, which means studios won't be putting the money in to remaster other 80s shows like Crime Story, Beauty and the Beast, The Twilight Zone and others that were edited on tape. If you can look past the picture quality and enjoy the show for what it is (was), then you should still enjoy this guilty pleasure.",1524787200,,1558,4.3944636678200695
