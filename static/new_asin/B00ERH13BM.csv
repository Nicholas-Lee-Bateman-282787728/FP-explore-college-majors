8608696,1,B00ERH13BM,"Wow, very, very disappointing movie. Zero suspense, character building or world building. Just a mix of flashback scenes showing some hysterical adults and the two lead characters walking on some empty roads along with present time shots of moody teens sitting with there backs against the walls in a vacant building, bitching about one thing or another. And there's a difference between vacant and abandoned. The main setting was in a vacant building...no furniture...everything moved out. There would be no reason to stay there, as all the cupboards and rooms had obviously been emptied.

And I get that this was shot on a tiny budget, but if the primary setting is unbelievable, then there's no chance of pulling the viewer in to the story. But that's the other problem...the story was very lacking. I literally ended up scanning through the last half or quarter of the movie to see if anything every developed. Nothing ever did. More sitting in rooms with backs to the wall, with a little conflict at the end that seemed meaningless at that point.",1411776000,3,1051,4.904494382022472
8608697,1,B00ERH13BM,"Synopsis (NO SPOILERS): The world population has been decimated by a virus sparing only children and leaving them to roam the countryside.

I envy you if this scenario strikes you interesting or even remotely original as this probably means you have never watched one of the countless films in the genre exploiting the idea of a post-apocalyptic society where a few human survivors are pit against hostile hordes of horrors (be they living, be they (un)dead).

The adults affected by the virus turn psycho, developing paranoia which in turn leads to acts of grisly violence, but the film sports no zombies eager to rip the flesh from the living. Considering the micro budget this variant was certainly not a bad move in order to save on the makeup and FX. Bleak landscapes and spartanly furnished indoor locations provide a tad of natural post-apocalyptic atmosphere, but still the film fails on too many levels to be enjoyable.

That is unless moody teenagers sitting backs to the wall sulking for hours is your thing. There isn't much else going on here but endless talks between the flat, invariably interchangeable juvenile characters. There is zero pacing, zero plot development, and zero suspense, despite some flashbacks dating back to the outbreak of the virus and the occassional emotional outburst between the youngsters.

Just to get it clear: this film is an endless source of boredom not for the lack of blood and gore or other cheap thrills usually associated with this genre but much rather because Children of a Darker Dawn is so poorly scripted. There is nothing here to mask the trite plot and general lack of substance. On top of that the tedious soundtrack (which appears like an endless loop of piano exercises) challenges your attention span to the limit.

According to the blurb Arts and Entertainment Magazine regards this flick as 'a modern doomsday version of Lord of the Flies'. They must have watched an entirely different film as the mere idea of comparison resembles an affront against William Golding.

But to come to the point: do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. Try Jorge Olguin's 'Descendents' [sic] (OT: Solus) instead, which isn't perfect either, but provides a much better execution of the original idea of children trapped in a post-apocalyptic nightmare.",1405468800,3,2305,4.989583333333333

8608699,5,B00ERH13BM,"I was lucky enough to attend the premiere here in Dublin at the Lighthouse Cinema last summer and was immediately impressed by how this film was put together, i was a horror genre fan for a long time and like many other lovers of the genre got a little fed up with how the modern horror movie is made, blood & guts and very little else. Which is exactly why ""Children Of A Darker Dawn"" stands out, Jason could have very easily done what a lot filmmakers of the genre tend to do, pay little attention to the story and the development of the characters as people within the eviornment they find themselves in, and too much attention to how many limbs can be hacked off before the opening credits even begin. Like i do with most of the films i view i try to find out a little about the director and in doing so i learned that he is a huge Hammer Horror film fan and fan of Horror films made during the 60's/70's & 80's in particular and it shows with the care and attention to detail that he has shown while directing ths film. Like many of the films Jason himself is a fan of, ""Children Of A Darker Dawn"" was shot on a tiny budget and like many of the film makers before him Jason has used what he has available to him to create a truly remarkable horror film, that will genuinely keep you fixed to the edge of your seat from beginning to end, oh and don't worry there is plenty of blood, gore & jump out of your skin moments to keep everyone happy but the rub is in they way it is used to tell the story. Give yourself a treat and watch a horror film that is made the way they were intended to be.",1382918400,18,1596,4.06984126984127
