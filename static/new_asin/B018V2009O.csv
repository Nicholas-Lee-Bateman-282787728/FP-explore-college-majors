7555792,5,B018V2009O,I have been lucky enough to see the all Eight episodes of season 5. I absolutely adore this show. There is one major parting of one of our beloved characters that left me in tears throughout the episode. I cannot wait for the Christmas episode and season 6.,1457740800,15,257,4.375
7555793,5,B018V2009O,"The midwife story moves onward. Like the babies they deliver, some characters remain, some move on. Yet the show continues to keep the same level of 1950s-60s era drama. New girls have become the leads of the stories and are becoming recognizable stars in their own right, due to this amazing series. Theres loves won, lost, life raw as well as periods of perfect bliss; until the next call for help.

Vannessa Redgrave is the voice of Jenny, the storyteller of what happened in her past, even though Jenny (Jessica Raine) moved on after 2014 to newer successful projects. Chummys gone, sadly. Returned Sisters played by Pam Ferris (Rosemary & Thyme in 4 Midwife eps this time), Jenny Agutter (all eps from the 2012 beginning), & Judy Parfitt (all). The young bike-riding midwife nurse brigade includes platinum Helen George (Trix), Laura Main (Shelah), and Bryony Hannah (Cynthia). Of course they cant function without Dr Turner (Stephen McGann).

Topics of this season include the PILL, lost nun, diseases from measles to cancer, smoking, thalidomide, and more, of course. Every episode has multi-plots, and health care-giver relationships. Christmas, followed by 8 more episodes, with subtitles.
 My wife and I have been in love with this series since the inception in 2012. Our doctor friend, retired, even took one season on a mission trip to Central America to aid in training on midwifery. Its a MUST OWN series, always good for second and third viewings. Nostalgia and London nursing, whats not to like?",1457049600,39,1511,5.036
7555794,5,B018V2009O,"TODAY SAW THE FIRST 5 EPISODES OF SEASON 5 ON YOUTUBE, I'M ASSUMING THERE ARE A FEW MORE EPISODES YET TO VIEW, CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM.

THIS ONE TAKES US INTO THE 60'S WHEN THE THALIDOMIDE ISSUE WAS BIG IN THE NEWS WITH BABIES BEING BORN DEFORMED AND THE BEGINNING OF STUDY IN THE LINK WITH CIGARETTES AND CANCER.

7555807,4,B018V2009O,"I have just come to the series, and while I wasn't sure originally how much I liked it, I have now finished season 5 and I love it. LOVE it. It is so interesting and beautiful and aggravating to see how people lived in times that are so different from the one we live in now, and the births of more than babies, but also of viewpoints and practices that turned out to have such profound impact on people's lives, Whether to feed with breast or bottle, whether what is new is automatically best, the ongoing issue of desperately poor people having one child after another that they can't feed or adequately shelter, illiteracy, hatred of people who are different, regardless of in what way, are still issues we grapple with today. It is also so interesting to see how things were then that are so different today, the ignorant but well meaning prescribing of or irresponsible taking of medication in pregnancy, the lack of technology, doctors making house calls,  the constant smoking!!!!!!!  I am not one to demonize smokers who do it responsibly, and i know back in the day they were just starting to know it wasn't healthy, and people did smoke everywhere, but to see people smoking in the hospital rooms, around sick babies, in the bedrooms, during birth scenes, everywhere, just is really revolting. You would think that people with medical experience would know that it wouldn't be helpful to anyone but they all puffed like chimneys.

I give the series four stars instead of five because of the writers' tendencies to make some of the characters too saintly and perfect. Perfect people are boring. Shelagh is the perfect wife, mother, and office manager, and Dr Turner and Peter Noakes are the perfect husbands, even though wives and mothers working for fulfillment instead of economic need was not widely done at that time. Sister Mary Cynthia is so saintly, she has no personality at all. There was a bit this season in which she showed some emotion, for about three minutes. I do not care for the characters of Jenny and Trixie, since it seems very unlikely to me that two young, very attractive girls would choose to live in a convent with a bunch of nuns. The character of Sr Monica Joan is basically one note. Since the first season, all she has done is go for the sweets, quote poetry and moan about her physical infirmities.  The additions of Nurse Crane, who is a loveable curmudgeon, and Patsy, who hides much pain, are much more believable.  Sr Julienne often comes across as the all knowing, all wise, all gentle mother of the house, but we see her struggle privately, and Jenny Agutter portrays her with excellence. The other characters and performances that absolutely shine are Sr Evangelina, who says it like it is, often too harshly, but never intending malice, and knows what she is about. SPOILER.............................

HER DEATH at the end of season 5 was heartbreaking. She was the best character, hilarious and genuine. Pam Ferris is stellar in this role. If there had to be a loss among the sisters, it should have been Sr Monica Joan.

I also love Chummy. She also is humorous, incredibly poignant, and her coming to terms with her mother, and her feelings about how she was treated by her mother are such good scenes. Patsy and Delia's trying to live and love authentically when no one in the world wanted to allow them to do so also hurts my heart, and I love their scenes together. I am watching the dvds of the seasons, so is there deleted material of their scenes? I don't know.",1500163200,,3520,4.676898222940226

7555831,5,B018V2009O,"I am enjoying watching Call the Midwife so much. I was a very young mother in 1963 in England, and I was told to feed my baby formula instead of breastfeeding, so when I saw the episode of the lady coming to talk to all the pregnant ladies about how much better formula was than breastfeeding, it brought back so many memories for me. I had a beautiful navy and white Pram which I would wheel my baby in to the shops, and people would stop and admire my baby. After my baby was born we had a nurse that would come to my home and make sure I knew how to take care of my baby. She would weigh him and perform little simple tests to make sure he was progressing. They encouraged me to keep notes and questions, and they would sit with me and answer any questions I had. It was all paid for by the NHS which I think is amazing. My second child was born in the USA. What a huge difference. Nothing personal about it. Big hospital, and in and out, and no follow up whatsoever. I had relatives that lived in the East End of London, so I can relate to Call the Midwife so much. It was a different world back then, and in some respects I miss it. I miss the culture in England. Not the weather though. Ha! My son, who was born in England in 1963 watches the series with me. He absolutely loves it. I would never have been able to tell him about those days in a way this series has. I'm so grateful they made this show. I just love it.",1489363200,,1425,4.003508771929824

7555840,5,B018V2009O,"I have never watched ""Call the Midwife,"" but my parents love it and they watch it on my Amazon account. As far as I can tell, CTM is like catnip for middle age-to-elderly couples who grew up in the era of sock hops, poodle skirts, and rotary phones. Why not? They long for an earlier, simpler time b/c they lived through it. Personally, I think it's adorable to watch them cuddle up under fleece blankets and watch a show together. Who cares if it's a show about semi-qualified obstetricians plying their trade in post-war London? I should be so lucky when I'm their age!

7555852,5,B018V2009O,"Call the Midwife is one of those television series that  on first look seems too odd to ever succeed, but then becomes a cult sensation that gains new viewers (most of whom quickly become passionate devotees) with every episode.  When the first season aired on PBS in the United States about five years ago I was highly skeptical that I could find anything appealing about a group of midwives delivering babies in the East End of London in the 1950s.  I turned on the first episode because there was nothing else I wanted to watch before ""Masterpiece"" came on. Within five minutes I was captivated, and I remain captivated after five beautiful seasons.  A stellar cast, wonderful writing, and gripping plots make every episode a must see, not just once but over and over again on DVDs.

With Season Five the changes at Nonnatus House in Poplar have mounted up.  Nurse Jenny, the central character of the early seasons,
has now left.  So have Chummy and a few others, but the perennial stalwarts Sister Julianne, Sister Evangelina, and nurses Trixie and Cynthia remain, ably assisted by new recruits, including a redoubtable Scottish lady with a decidedly independent streak. Other returnees include the males associated with Nonnatus House: the hapless handyman, the vicar, and the local doctor. And of course there is the ethereally batty Sister Monica Joan, whose tenuous grip on reality seems to lessen with each episode.  All of these characters have their own personal challenges they must deal with along with those of their clientele, the residents of Poplar, where the National Health Service, new tower blocks of more comfortable flats, and an influx of immigrants from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean all create new opportunities and complexities.

The time period for Season 5 is 1960-61, when the advent of the Pill created new opportunities and new moral complexities.  It's busy as usual in Poplar, with the phone ringing day and night at Nonnatus House summoning a midwife to another delivery. Tragically, some of the babies are born with terrible deformities, and by the end of the season the doctor and midwives are wondering if the miracle anti-nausea drug thalidomide might be to blame.  The season ends with a particularly sad departure, though as always on Call the Midwife there is also the promise of new life and new hope.  This three DVD set contains all eight Season 5 episodes as well as the 2015 Christmas special.",1484438400,2,2442,4.943765281173594

I believe each episode will allow you to experience a wide range of emotions that will leave you laughing to inspired to sadness and back again. This series has stood the test of time and competing programs and continues to come out on top in my opinion.  The mark of a great series - Midwife has lost a few major actors and added new characters since its first season and has only gotten better.  The writing is tops and continues to offer arresting stories while staying within the theme of the original book - outstanding service by the caregivers and an outstanding bravery and fortitude by the families.",1483574400,,737,4.734375

Especially touching are the Christmas episodes of each season. The actors/actresses are all unbelievably gifted and their words are never wasted.  Whoever wrote the episodes was a genius because some of what is said is downright beautiful and very moving. Since my husband and I were born in the late 50's and early 60's, it's fun to see familiar items pop up in the background. Season 5 was one of our favorite seasons, although we'd be hard-pressed to say which one is our most favorite. We truly love them all.",1477267200,,655,4.533898305084746

7556025,5,B018V2009O,"What a beautiful television series incorporating real medical issues from the early sixties.  All of the characters in the series are like friends to me.  My blu-ray set arrived with a damaged case but the discs were in pristine condition.  The episodes are recorded on discs similar to previous seasons - this set has the 2015 Christmas special and eight episodes on 2 discs.  There is also a making of special feature.  There are subtitles and the sound is perfect for this essentially diaglogue-driven series.
On a side note, my wife is a labor and delivery nurse at one of the large hospitals in Peoria, Illinois.  I love what she does but I never see her at work.  Watching Call the Midwife is about as close as I can get to the ""action"" and sometimes this viewer is so close that I think one of the nurses will make eye contact with me and ask me pass her that towel!
Season 6 has been announced for broadcast in early 2017 with a 2016 Christmas special also.",1472947200,4,965,4.448863636363637

7556082,5,B018V2009O,"An excellent, well acted, series based on the experiences of nurse-midwives in 1960-61 England.  It is remarkable for its respectful treatment of religious belief in the person of the nun's who are trained midwives as well as the secular nurses. These stories dramatize actual events that could happen to real people.  It also highlights the important prenatal and birth services provided by nurse-midwives then and now.  These are women that deserve much credit for their often ignored service.  Also there is no gunfire, explosions, car chases, helicopter crashes, and so forth.  It does however deal with realistic problems such as unwanted pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, racial issues, women's health, infant care and so forth.
Highly recommended.",1470528000,,755,5.418803418803419

7556128,5,B018V2009O,"Every woman I know has loved this series because it touches your heart. There's nothing like a new born baby to change everyone's life. The midwifes in this series are unselfish, compassionate, hardworking, and never selfish because they sometimes have to go out to deliver a baby in the middle of the night. They are backed up by the Catholic nuns whom they live with in an old, charming building near London's East side. Much of the power and beauty of this series is that it is based on a real midwife's recollection of birthing occurances, some joyous, some sad, that occurred during the 1950's and 60's close to where the ships come in and out.

The best part of the series, however, is the very realistic and compelling charcters. One of the most beautiful sequences involves Dr. Turner who, without intending to, falls in love with one of the nuns and though they fight it, they end up getting married because God seems to work everything out. I know of such a case in real life. This series also ways the challenges of women of all ages who are doing the best they can in life.",1467417600,3,1085,4.50761421319797

Season 5 was a rough one. Personally, I wish Miranda Hart was involved more. Chummy is my favorite character. I am hoping the rumors of her return on season 6 is true. Some really great story lines this season. I don't want to give anything away, but Sister Cynthia has a very powerful performance.

Changes in showrunning, however, have impacted its quality this season and made viewing less enjoyable.  First, scene-to-scene editing is choppy and uneven (and this does not refer to the standard - albeit unnecessary - editing done to bring the show to the U.S. from the U.K.)  One scene will have a prolonged close, while the next is chopped off.  It makes the viewing experience unnerving.  Second, the subject matter is already dramatic, but the showrunners have kicked it over the edge into melodramatic.  Characters (and writing) have gone over the top, and it's a shame, because the Thalidomide crisis and other critical issues addressed (sexual assault, tragic death, alcoholism, being gay in a homophobic world, etc.) are meaty enough without the melodrama.  As were Sister Monica Joan's speeches before they became soap opera moanings this season.  The soundtrack, which used to be one of the best on TV, has become oppressive and manipulative.  Score is supposed to highlight a scene and lend it emotional weight, not drown it out with treacle.  Even the photography has become melodramatic, with lingering closeups of characters crying or moaning or just being melodramatic.

That said, I still find the performances excellent (that the actors can often rise above some the more melodramatic material is a testament to their talent), and I still love the characters and their interactions in Poplar.  Please, CTM, review your earlier series and take a cue.  Drop the melodrama, fix the score (not all scenes require oppressive background music, some would breathe better without it), and make the crying closeups a rarely used device).  Do that, and I will consider you 5 stars again.",1466035200,4,1815,5.122448979591836

I loved, Downtown, don't get me wrong, and I will miss it dearly, mostly for Granny's zingers, but Call the Midwife is telling a story that the modern world needs to hear.  We have become so lost in our own lives, with a great deal of help from electronic media, that we don't know who are neighbors are.  Our children don't play in the streets anymore, and childbirth has become (at least in the America), a completely sterile affair.  These midwives remind us of a time when people cared for each other, and when it wasn't a sin to be poor.  I am unashamedly proud of the Nuns of Nonnatus House.  There are times when their kindness and calm in the face of adversity causes me to weep.

The show also deals with the uglier side of human nature - prejudice, ignorance, the above mentioned poverty, but through it all the midwives, the nuns, and the neighbors of Poplar strive to be better for themselves and for their neighbors.  The time period in which the show takes place saw great change, both medically and socially, and this is very well presented with great attention to small details and in the way the actors portray their characters.  This show is a history lesson of the best kind  and should be required watching of all middle school girls (and boys, too, for that matter), as it deals with life, and death, and the rewards of being our ""Brothers Keepers.""

Though childbirth is a central theme, of course, and may be difficult for the squeamish, this is a ""must see"" if ever there was one.  I only wish we had such a service here, now, in the good ol' USA!  Can you imagine what it would mean to have nurses and physicians who actually know who you are and are willing to spend more than five minutes before they dash off to their next patient?  This is a big check mark for in the box for American Universal Health!",1465344000,24,1950,4.410614525139665

I am glad to say that I was hasty in my concern.  The series not only survived,  but has been refreshed by focusing on new or lesser-known characters,  and manages to highlight some very serious issues.  They did not back away from alternative lifestyles, educating people about medicines and programs for those who could not afford treatment.  I think the evolving of the Turner Family is touching. Well done.... I hope that we get many more seasons.  We've lost ""Downton Abbey"" and will soon lose ""Mr. Selfridge"".  I wish they'd resurrect ""The Paradise"".

7556339,5,B018V2009O,"Worried that this show would lose its mojo without Nurse Lee (Jessica Raine)? Well, fear no more. Season Five has arrived and the stories of the nurse midwives and the sisters at Nonnatus House are as delightful as ever. We're only a few episodes in here in the States, but I'll be watching until the end, you can be sure.

The 60s have arrived in the East End of London, bringing with it things to celebrate and things to mourn. For the first time, the midwives encounter the appalling damage that thalidomide can do -- they deliver a baby who has virtually no limbs. I'm sure this story line will continue. At the same time, we see the stirrings of women's consciousness. Trixie finds redemption in her struggle with alcohol by joining a ""Get Fit"" class, and working her way up to instructor. Sister Julienne (Jenny Agutter) reprimands her for appearing in a newspaper photo in tights, but Trixie doesn't back down. She makes it clear that she's not a nun and doesn't have to abide by the nuns' rules. It looks like the issue of smoking is going to be addressed. The midwives even get new, more flattering uniforms to herald the new decade.

I'm eager to see where the story line with Tom the vicar (Jack Ashton) goes -- he and Trixie were once engaged but broke it off. Now it looks like he and  Nurse Barbara Gilbert (Charlotte Ritchie) might be feeling an attraction, while Trixie looks on with some dismay. As always, it's the nurses' and nuns' personal lives that interest me more than the people they attend to. The cases generally end  with hearts and flowers all around -- for example, the father of the thalidomide baby is disgusted and violently opposed to bringing the baby home, but by the end of the show he's lovingly cuddling her. Personally, I'd like a little more reality when it comes to the patients.
