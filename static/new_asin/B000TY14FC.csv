2911208,5,B000TY14FC,"This video boldly confronts what is accepted as fact about today's black man - and demonstrates how much of what we think is true, is myth.  Scene after scene shows us what the black community says about it's self and how that just doesn't square with the facts: prison, HIV, inter racial marriage, alimony payments, etc.  In one scene, the camera shows us over and over members of the black community saying that there are more black men in prison than in college, when the fact is that for every black man in prison, there are four in college.  More importantly, the video deals with the why and that involves following the money, because there are those who are cashing in big by keeping an intellectual status quo, that isn't real.  Broad range of experts, footage from civil rights era, music - this video will keep anyone engaged.  This is a story that must be told",1189728000,36,871,4.5576923076923075

2911210,5,B000TY14FC,"Bro. Morton this documentary is right on point!  I share the same feelings that you do regarding how we are perceived in the media.  More importantly, our young brothers and sisters do not realize how the media has drawn them into an apathetic mind set towards school and education.
The media knows excatly what it is doing. Unfortunately, most of us don't.
The half truths and whole lies reinforces what they want us to believe about us. This movie is a must show for all real educators and people concerned about Black folks and our future.

2911213,5,B000TY14FC,"WAKE UP! Not since ROOTS, the mini T.V. series of the 70's, has a movie generated so much dialogue within the Black American Community and the internet.  ""The revolution will not be televised"", is an understatement when you see the negative images, cultured misconceptions, and antagonism toward black men inside their own community; including the naive carnage of children exercised by black women.  Moreover, this movie illustrates how black people, once with an autonomous vision of the future, became reliant on government programs and broken promises.

Producer/Director Janks Morton narrates how some black organizations and self-appointed leaders profit from the negative data regarding black men; thus, generating government capital to support their organization or programs. Furthermore, Morton explores how the cultured misconception and negative images of black men generates millions of dollars for corporate America in the areas of music, television, and film [Hollywood].  As a result, the negative images are glorified making black male incarceration socially empowering and demeaning black women endearing.  Because of this, black women have adopted negative black male stereotypes as the norm creating a civil social distance; to include not wanting to birth black children. Morton acknowledges this behavior earlier in the film by stating, ""An Undeclared Civil War has been waged between black men and women"".

In short, the movie ""What Black Men Think', illustrates how the media, black leadership, and the entertainment industry profit from the negative metaphors about Black American men. The films key points are supported by statistical data and expert commentary from journalist and authors.  I heard about this movie on satellite radio and various web sites throughout the summer; it's only a matter of time before this DVD makes national news.

2911214,5,B000TY14FC,"I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. My wish is for everyone to see it.  Does it ever make you wonder what happened to black men after the road was paved by Dr. King and others during the civil rights era? Most black men were very proud, hard working, revered and respected by their families, as well as one another.  This film takes a look at black men of the past and black men of the present.  It answers some tough questions and explores many issues that black men face today. This movie is presented by very intelligent black men, as well as  by a brilliant panel of experts, telling you what black men really think.  This film is entertaining, full of thought provoking and surprising information, has a great soundtrack, as well a sense of humor provided by producer/director/narrator, Janks Morton. There is no doubt that it will be enjoyed by all.",1186099200,8,871,4.522292993630574

Janks Morton and the What Black Men Think collaborators are doing healing and teaching work!  May they continue to produce quality and informative healing tools.  I highly recommend that folks purchase the DVD copy.  I watched it twice and gave it to my father to use in his diversity training work and leadership development mentoring with African American men.  I think all fathers and sons should watch this documentary together.  I also think that fraternities, men's organizations like the Masons, and other community-based service groups should view it and share it with younger men and boys.

2911218,5,B000TY14FC,"I stumbled across this video while channel surfing and the title grabbed my attention. I'm as black as any other black man but being of mixed heritage and a mixed neighborhood and a private school education, have all had the effect of leaving me somewhat disconnected from the larger community. Add to that mix that I was raised as a catholic means I was also not part of the black church. Though I love my people there are many times when I felt isolated. I am also not someone who feels a need to watch TV or be in the know as far as news. the good is hard to find and the bad shows up no matter how much you avoid it. So when I saw this I was intrigued.

2911228,5,B000TY14FC,This profound revelation of the truth concerning black men opens the door for a new dialogue to take place within the black community.  The current paradigm of mis-information for profit is unacceptable and the time for  reclaiming our true place in the fabric of the American experience has come.,1351296000,,297,5.040816326530612
2911229,4,B000TY14FC,"The title of the video is completely wrong.  It should have been ""The Vilification and Character Assassination of Black Men in the U.S.A (or something similar).  Strong words?  Just  watch the video.  It addresses the myths about institutionalized campaigns and racial stereotypes based on common myths abbot Black Men.  The video's conclusions are based on empirical data and clear facts that sometimes astounds you because you thought you really knew how it worked.  This is must viewing for young Black Men (and some mature also) to elevate their self esteem significantly while clarifying important obstacles they face.  It is also critical knowledge for all objective free thinkers who seek the truth in these troubled times.  I bought one for each of my ""at risk"" youth friends and family.",1346284800,,795,5.1484375
2911230,3,B000TY14FC,"Although this documentary can be provocative at times, it conveniently downplays the myriad issues that plague the black community.  Morton is so interested in preserving the reputation of black men, he is willing to sacrifice the integrity of black women by purporting that black women have managed to decimate the black community by way of abortion, while ignoring the number of black men who leave these women to grapple with such a dilemma. And though black women accounted for 45% of abortions performed in 2005, Morton conveniently neglects to mention that 49% of all homocide victims in 2005 were black. More over, even though there were more black males in college than were in jail or prison in 2005, 193,000 black males in prison out of 1,896,000 total (Washington Post) is way too many.  The point:  There is still a disproportionate number of black males in prison, there is still a high rate of illiteracy among young black males, there is still a large gang populataion amoung young black and Latino males, and there is still a high rate of single parent homes in the black community.  These facts was swept under the rug.  The bottom line is that in a post civil right era, there is still a quandary in the black community that cannot be blamed solely on the media.",1338336000,2,1280,4.747747747747748
2911231,4,B000TY14FC,"As an African-American woman, I agree with most of the information divulged in this film....the director and his contributor's spoke candidly about what I've said about black leadership over and over again (I won't spoil the movie!).  I just wish that the director had used actual documentation to illustrate his point...instead of 'doing the math' for the viewers...but overall an excellent movie.",1270512000,,398,5.419354838709677

2911233,2,B000TY14FC,"I bought this in the hopes that I could show it in a class on American culture.  It was a bit expensive (ordered from America, sent to Japan).  It didn't have subtitles (always problematic, if you want it to be used or enjoyed by non-native English speakers), and I just didn't find it particularly interesting, or informative.  Maybe it deserves a second viewing, and deeper consideration, but my opinion from watching it once was that the filming was odd (did I have a bad copy, or did they mean for it to look like that?) and it didn't catch my interest.  Perhaps it is meant to motivate Black men, more than it is to educate people in general.",1256256000,2,647,4.4576271186440675
2911234,2,B000TY14FC,"As someone who is pretty far left on the political spectrum, I do find black conservatism to be quite interesting. Its thinkers are sincerely concerned with the empowerment of their people, and I think they have things to offer that are immensely helpful to every one of us.

The title of the film is a bit misleading, as this is not a representative cross-section of Black America. Most of the panelists are on the right-hand side of the political spectrum, but nevertheless it serves as an introduction to black conservative thought. Probably most people are very misinformed on what exactly black conservatism is, and in that sense this is a helpful documentary.

Unfortunately, I think it suffered from bad editing. Sound bites were not always concatenated in a logical manner, and sometimes they were too brief to convey ideas with any kind of complexity. This could lead to confusion, as in the discussion of HIV/AIDS and homosexuality in the black community. They had some chart that just left me scratching my head, because I wasn't sure what information they were trying to convey.

The soundtrack, and especially the popping sounds of the percussion, could be distracting at times.

Finally, I have to say that I did not appreciate being blindsided by the anti-choice propaganda when abortion was named as the putative No. 1 killer of black people. This idea was not even fleshed out, just dramatically stated alongside the visual aid of a bar graph. A few nasty words were said about Margaret Sanger, and then they were onto the next topic. These are very sticky issues (the book ""Killing the Black Body"" contains an interesting -- and nuanced -- analysis of Margaret Sanger's ties with the eugenics movement), but they are not explored in any depth. And let's not even talk about the rather misogynistic inference that black women are apparently the No. 1 murderers of black people. Parts like this one definitely made me feel like I was being hit over the head with ideology rather than being given the opportunity to come to my own conclusions.",1240012800,8,2058,4.888252148997134
2911235,5,B000TY14FC,This documentary was an enlightening review of the true statistics of the status of the Black man in america.  The information the media puts out on black men is misleading.  I would recommend everyone see this documentary.,1238716800,,223,5.0
2911245,5,B000TY14FC,"The product was well recieved by myself and others and is just what is needed today for our community.

CONGRATULATIONS FOR PROPERLY REPRESENTING YOUR PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!  KEEP IT UP BIG BROTHER . PEACE AND BLESSINGS.",1219449600,3,376,4.875
2911246,2,B000TY14FC,"The reocurring theme in this film asks us to do our research, well when we do, we find that many not all, but many of the experts that they interview are advocates of a republican agenda that does more harm to black men than good. Although much of what is said in this documentary has a ring of truth, some statements are incorrect,i.e.( there are approx. 700,000 black men incarcerated and 800,000 black men in college, when actually there are currently 900,000 black men incarcerated and 800,000 black men in college). Many black men are locked up when white men committing the same crimes only receive a slap on the wrist. We can not use injustice such as institutionalized rascism as a crutch, but we can not simply ignore it either.
Pundits like Armstrong Williams and Juan Williams are almost laughable,if they weren't such tragic figures. Both are paid for spreading the right wing agenda. A. Williams was discovered receiving a stipend from the current republican administration and J. Williams from Fox news to be Bill O'Reilly's lackey.
I agree with the premise of this film, but I can do without the conservative slant.",1215993600,10,1130,4.829896907216495
2911247,4,B000TY14FC,"I just finished watching this ""documentary/commentary"" and my head is filled with reflections and anecdotes...by the way, it is a very good work by Janks Morton.
To some of the curious out there wondering why I watched it and am now writing a review, I had a reasonable hunch that this DVD would speak to my convictions and past complaints about this nation, the media, and rank-and-file leadership.  I just watched the O'Reilly Factor today where he interviewed two guests about Reverend Jesse Jackson's comments yesterday that Barack Obama had been ""talking down to Black people"" (Why? Because he was challenging Black men to do the right and basic thing: be a father and raise their kids?!! Oh, that's so condescending!??) and how he wants to ""cut his n*&# off""...one of the guests was Dr. Dyson who, in my opinion, committed the all-too-human error of not quite attributing FULL responsibility to a person he supports/admires. In this case he didn't strongly hold Jackson responsible for the VERY direct comments Jackson made towards Obama (minimizing the comments as ""crude""...how about lame, embarrassing and even hostile?!).  Dr. Dyson also disagreed that Jackson and Sharpton play the ""Victimization"" game!  This exemplifies the pervasive problem that was demonstrated by Obama and other Black supporters towards Reverend Jeremiah Wright and Wright's hateful/irresponsible/dishonoring-the-pulpit rhetoric: the reverend was just ""taken out-of-context"" (which means, roughly, ""It's a Black thing...you [Whites] wouldn't understand""}. This kind of diminishing/ignoring of a problem is an issue this DVD deals with very, very well...the dirty laundry of the Black Community (Jesse Peterson stating the problem of the faulty reasoning that only those who aren't Black can be racist...so Black people don't make the same mistakes and cause deep pain, right?!...Thank you, Mr. Peterson for stating the obvious!!)
Now bear with me, but this is my firm belief and RELIEF, after the Obama/Wright fiasco I told a friend that it was a good thing for the Black Community's dysfunctionalism and sickness (i.e. the Black Church in this case) to be ""aired""....if anything it all the more affirmed that these folks are truly human and just like the rest of us (which is a very NON-Racist affirmation)...imperfect, not as strong as they think, sinners, and in some ways pretty messed up.  I didn't take glee in the problems in and of themselves, but the opportunity for growth from knowing the truth...for I believe the truth can really set the Black Commmunity, and America for that matter, free.
Watching the DVD reminded me of the days when I took my Race Relations class at UC Berkeley and had to walk on eggshells whenever I or ANY White student said something (the Black students would all intensely wait for ""us"" to say anything they judged as rife with stereotypes and/or racism)...man, that was just way out-of-line, not to mention the fact that somehow they were just always right regarding their interpretations of ""racial"" observations of the world....they adopted their own superiority [ the reasoning being: I am Black/I'm from a minority, which means that I have experienced racism that you haven't experienced, thus you have no right/accurate criticism/opinion regarding such a matter ].  So, I could have thoughts on the matter, but they just weren't right OR they were ignorant or maybe evennnnnn RACIST!  So, all their bases were covered! At seminary I took a Black Culture and World View class taught by a Adjunct Professor who is a African-American pastor from East Oakland. He handed out a paper his son wrote about our perceptions of the world, of races, of nations, which was fine and interesting until I saw that he questioned why the globe is even seen as North America on top and the ""lower"" continents, Africa and South America, as beneath the U.S. and Europe....you see where I'm going, but he thought it was inherently racist for the White nations to be on top (even this point was addressed in this DVD!).  I was trying my darnedest to be open-minded but I was thinking that it was just bizarre and I was too P.C.-intimidated to say, ""Hey, doesn't anyone else think this is a pile of s*@#?!""
Mr. Morton does a fine job providing clarifying, empowering truth to help free the Black Community and reverse the tide of self-destruction and ""self-doubt"" that permeates it, at least in the range from the youth to middle-aged persons...and for that I thank him, because it not only serves the African-American segment of our society, it really contributes to the betterment of our nation as a whole.  When I observe and opine about the Black Community it is not that I am taking potshots in a juvenile way, but that I truly care for my fellow Americans and hate to see and hear the lies and distortions that continue to permeate social and political dialog. ( God created all of us and I see it as a fundamental dishonoring of Him if I ""look down"" on any fellow human being, whether on the basis of appearance, intelligence, culture, race, gender...not to mention it is idiotic to think so highly of myself compared to the Creator! ).
I desire that any American view this DVD to at least further understand and gain appreciation for a different non-media-hyped set of views regarding the Black Community as well as the moving, artistic poetry of Talaam Acey.  I wish there were more snippets of people-on-the-street and some of the interviews looked a bit thrown together (Michael Steele was just sitting in some corner of the room where you could see the doorknob stop-pad on the wall---that looked tacky and too informal for a man of his stature) and some of the camera views were out-of-center and a head or two was cut off!  The music and comedic touches were well-placed and entertaining.
I celebrate Mr. Morton and fellow commentators in the film and wish them a very blessed and prosperous life in this tarnished and fantastic country of ours.  May we work together to better the nation for ALL of us!",1215734400,4,6023,4.959365708622398
2911248,5,B000TY14FC,It sure is refreshing to see that everyday black men and some high profile black men aren't buying into the victim mentality.

The best way to prove if something is right or wrong is by displaying facts... pure numbers!  Also, this DVD did an excellent job at explaining how the main purpose of all these things we are being fed... MONEY!  In America... it is ""All About the Money!"".  Sad but TRUE!  Just think about the so called ""War on Drugs"" and you will understand.  But I won't go into that right now.  As soon as we change our thinking and question/research much we hear in the media, the better prepared we will be to move forward as a people.

I am planning to sit down with a small group of my peers (family and friends; young and old) and have a viewing of this DVD.  Afterwards, we will have a deep discussion on the topics presented.  It's a small step in opening the minds of many of the people I care about in my life.  Some might agree and some might dis-agree with what is said, but that is fine!

I was so moved with this DVD I told my boss, and we ordered it for our students at the Community College where I work could see it during Black History Month.

If you have had stereotypes that you have thought about Black Men, then you need to see this.  I especailly feel ALL African-Americans should watch this DVD.

Written by Black men, it is a must-see for all people. Do not hesitate to buy this, and be sure and tell your friends.",1202774400,,439,4.4625
2911262,3,B000TY14FC,"This is a compilation of remarks from a number of successful black men who are leading a movement to get the black community into an era of self help. Many are people like Juan Williams (Enough) and Bill Cosby who have already stated a position on this issue. The DVD suggests that many of the problems of blacks have been exagerated by those who have a vested interest in the continueing subjagation of black men. For example, the question is asked, ""Are there more black men in jail or in college?"" Because of media hype, the general consensus is jail, but in fact not only overall, but by age group segmentation, there are infinitely more in college. That answer does not help some social service agencies, for example who depend on the black male as a client base. While the concept and content is interesting, the production values are a bit mediocre.",1200614400,4,856,4.6381578947368425
2911263,5,B000TY14FC,If you are a person who enjoys learning about issues from multiple perspectives to arrive at an opinion after weighing as many facts as you can get your hands on; this movie is for you.,1200268800,,185,4.314285714285714
2911264,4,B000TY14FC,"Originally, I viewed this film in a group setting. I then purchased it for critical review and found most premises sound and somewhat enlightening, yet not surprising.  Bad news has always been good news for selling things. The title did cause consternation and almost a desire to skip the perspective period, as I would with any attempt to speak boldly regarding a singular suggested perspective for individual thought or group thought for an entire body of people.

The salient point is ""why men are cataloged and studied as a skin color, and somehow having that representation mean class in American society"", which the film raises.

Looking at France today, which appears to be making a noble effort toward a ""non-color classified society"", their efforts will not be without problems.  But what good cause is?  Changing this paradigm virus is possible just as much as creating the current one was possible.  You must begin somewhere with courage.  Where is America's courageous apology for their role in this ""crime against humanity?""

In America, though I understand attacking systemic racism and its strategies from the classified group perspective, I'd like it clearly understood that an individual initiative to perceive oneself from the perspective of ""man"" rather than a ""black man"" begins the gradual release of him from the dominant, systemically categorized, limited, pawn perspective assigned to him by the malevolent, priviledged-classed; even if the privileged concession is given simply for being born a certain color. They too are victim in the strategy of the game.  It just hasn't bitten them yet.(Globalization will do that.)

We as individuals will gain greater understanding through self-examination and self-empowerment, formulating our own world-view, correcting flawed perspectives at the spiritual level, before we take on the noble, altruistic cause to help our community.  This way, we can ""stay in the game with personal power"" for the long trial ahead.

Here is a quote I heard in 1993 from Dr. A.R. Bernard, New York:  ""spiritual renewal is always followed by economic revitalization."" I also will paraphrase Matthew 6:33, seek revelation of the kingdom of God and you will gain revelation of yourself, adding things that will help you get what you need.  Whenever Truth is peverted and made a lie, understanding from it is also in err.  Therefore, to buy into the lie required lack of review of the lie, producing the faulty acceptance of the circumstance and therein the perspective.  Truth remained as witness to itself.  Words can't change Truth.  Words stimulate thought.  Thought is creative with potential for construction or destruction.

I suggest reading ""As a Man Thinketh"" by James Allen and ""Virus of the Mind by Richard Brodie, for men seeking understanding by renewal of the mind as well as understanding how these viruses (memes) of the mind replicates themselves in society.

The condition of the mind, if not fortified, is the fertile soil of error for the opinions like those responding to the questions who perpetuate the myth.  It's called Marketing.

I applaud Janks Morton and the other contributors to this project for sounding a clarion call.  Our group, THE EUREKA SOCIETY, works at root causes of these and other cripling perspectives.

Our children need to be educated about the real truth of the black community.  I have been pushed to do my own research on issues that I hear in the media.

The awareness that there are more black men in college than incarcerated needs to be stated in all of the correctional institution. The myth that more young black men are incarcerated than educated needs to be heard.

I will be showing What Black Men think to my Matures Men's Ministry and Young Men's Ministries and Black History book club.

I also have done some research and I now know they are themselves the reason why these things are haunting them. Our men have been repeating the same behavior for centuries.

They keep looking outside for the reason of their conditions.

Now that some of them have discovered capital hills intentions perhaps we need to look at each other and say why aren't we marrying again... one another dispite the media?

Why aren't we taking each other up by the hands once we have elevated ourselves?

Why don't we put a few books in the libraries of our childen we want them to read.

I would like to see this film sent to the prisons? The juvenille detention centers? Man is the greatest conductor of the world if you want to send a message send it directly to man.

I agree it is not complete I admire the start.

I think a change is coming and I am glad to see a film like this.

I strongly believe will create a new capital hill. How do we perceive we want things and are we in the position to make those things a reality?

I think we all need to turn off the tv and read only those things that will enable you the fuel to make what is in front of you what you desire it to be.
