7844540,5,6303336302,"My 4 year old loves the Timmy the Tooth series of videos. I think this one and ""Lost My Brush"" are my favorites. It's a typical surprise party plot where Timmy's friends ignore him and make him think they forgot his birthday. At the end, Timmy learns that they were just planning a surprise party for him. The songs are super cute and the puppetry is as good as any muppet/sesame street video. I would highly recommend this video as well as others in the series.",1337644800,,462,4.383720930232558
