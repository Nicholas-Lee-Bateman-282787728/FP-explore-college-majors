7927891,4,B00004Z1FP,"If you have ever had to staff a booth at an expo or community fair, and are not the particularly outgoing type, you will appreciate this movie.  Nestor Carbonell (script writer and star) does a great job of conveying the anguish and dread of waiting for someone to stop by the table and dreading it when they do.  The bulk of the film takes place in K-Mart, and trust me, it's spot on.",1360627200,,385,4.260273972602739
7927892,4,B00004Z1FP,Maybe the only flaw with the movie is its title and cover. Viewers may expect a snappy comedic romp rather than the personal odyssey film that it is. Maybe that explains the negative reviews. I agree whole-heartedly with the two four-star reviews written below.,1073779200,2,261,4.954545454545454

7927894,4,B00004Z1FP,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie and I enjoyed it very much. I also ran across a review by Bill Stamet on April 9, 1999 in the Chicago Sun TImes,  which expresses my sentiments exactly. Directed by Philip Charles Mackenzie and written by Nestor Carbonell, this exceptional independent feature stars Carbonell (co'star on NBC's ""Suddenly Susan"") playing the role of Enrique Suarez, a Cuban actor from Connecticut who plays the role of Francesco on a sitcom called "" Two Guys, Two Gals and a Cuban,"" So many indie films dwell too cutely on indie wannabes as wacky, quirky heroes aiming to make it big.  Such self-indulgence is rarely illuminating.  What makes ""Big K"" unique is the deep sympathy it builds for Enriques's plight.  His career teeters and his marriage cries for repair.  Yet this perceptive comedy never resorts to cheap sarcasm.  When Enrique jets to Houston for an in-store autograph signing at a new Kmart, Carbonell depicts his humiliation with excruciating precision.  The film's absurd wit manages to celebrate the American dream with a bit of Nietzschean philosophy.  The cast includes serious turns by Luke Perry, Casey Affleck, Michael Lerner and Martin Mull. I would go out and buy this movie.",975369600,10,1224,4.995073891625616
