8400883,5,B003NE6658,"This is an absolutely awesome series.  I watched it originally as it was aired online episode by episode in the spring of 09.  This series is bold, witty, well produced, amazingly acted, and the original music that accompanies this show is wonderfully done.  Writer James Bailey and lead actor Matt Laumann definitely hit a home run with this one!  You should definitely check this out!",1274745600,,386,4.892307692307693
