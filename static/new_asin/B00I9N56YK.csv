8640211,3,B00I9N56YK,"Blu Ray - 4/5: This Blu Ray comes with two audio commentaries, an interview and 2 trailers. Audio and video is good. Yay.

Movie - 2/5: I know this movie is well loved by cult film and Ozploitation fans alike, but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. And yes I know you need reasons or excuses but I could care less how you feel. I hated this movie so shove it.",1483574400,,370,4.0

Ugh talk about a total waste of time anticipating it's arrival, money and excitement!  :(",1407542400,,262,4.326530612244898

8640214,5,B00I9N56YK,"I hate to start a review with ""I,"" but I (3) think this is one of the most significative movies of its era, utterly of its time, and yet unique in its time and as yet. Its creepiness and navet only enhance each other, and its low-tech chills feel all the chillier for that. The performances are superb --did we even realize how great Michael Murphy was at the time?-- and this terrific blu ray treatment only heightens the overall effectiveness and effortless endearment of a movie whose discovery I envy you. (Finally. You.) Cheers, and enjoy.",1403049600,2,544,4.618556701030927
