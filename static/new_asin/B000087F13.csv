1828155,1,B000087F13,"The current favourite -if that is the apposite word- among devotees of  stupendously lousy movies seems to be Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space ,although Robot Monster has its champions too. Now ,I  regard the cult of ""so bad  , its good "" as beneath contempt .The spectacle of the great Bela Lugosi ,morphine monkey on his back ,stumbling through illiterate twaddle should be buried in  a deep vault and not paraded for the self styled intelligensia to laugh at.
Truly bad movies are like Revelation -or the intellectual masturbation of the Manhattan ingrown hair Mr Allen--and they fall into this category because they are pretentious and incompetent .Revelation in particular trivialises an important topic and additionally handles it in a manner that is incoherent ,stumbling and insulting to all faiths.
It focuses on the hunt for a sacred relic -nails from the true cross ,from which it is possible to recreate Christ from his DNA.The movie follows the battle for the relic among competing groups ,including the Knights Templar .
It fails to generate any real tension despite having a fair share of physical action scenes and the acting is woeful ,especially from Terence Stamp who gives the impression he is reading from an autocue and cannot quite believe the stultifying banality of his dialogue .(He is not the only one )
The ending is abrupt and seems to be designed to leave the way open to a sequel .
Meritricious garbage and to be avoided by all people with an ounce of interest in religion or devotion to movies",1062374400,3,1526,4.812977099236641
1828156,1,B000087F13,"Well yet again the politically correct has tried to bring forth occult movies that dislodge and deforms the truth that is in Christianity and in the Scriptures.  The movie shows that there are evil Christian (so they say they are) groups out to get the world.  That only through tolerance and witchcraft can there be harmony for one and all.  A sad movie, sad lies, but not overly surprising for me.",1061510400,4,399,4.591549295774648
1828157,3,B000087F13,"While certainly not a movie for those with ADD (who will be bored to tears with the bad editing and pacing), this literati thriller is fairly decent.  I expected more of Terence Stamp's acting, but overall the film was well cast.
The film is in the vein of the literary thriller, like the Ninth Gate, or the recent book The Da Vinci Code, and combines the conspiracies of the Knights Templars (the Illuminati in this movie), Second Coming, and the Jesus & Mary Magdaline marriage.
Our heroes are the ex-con son of Terence Stamp's character and an alchemist that Stamp brings in to study an artifact with other experts.  They slowly unveil the possible meanings of the artifact, which in turn leads to many deaths.
Throughout we are taken on a whirlwind tour of Europe's lesser known religious shrines in the quest to rediscover the artifact and learn of the conspiracy surrounding it.  The movie culiminates in the birth of the Antichrist and the beginning of the End Days.
All in all, I found this movie to be interesting, but it was very flawed.  The editing was shoddy, but the story and most of the acting was solid.  If you're into conspiracies, alternative religion, alchemy, weird science, and intrigue, you may also like it.",1057881600,6,1232,4.738317757009346
1828158,4,B000087F13,"This movie provided me with much food for thought and meditation on the Apocalypse and the coming birth of Antichrist.  The idea behind the movie is that Christ's blood traces which are left on the nails used to crucify him have been hidden in a secret box.  By unlatching the nails from the box, a secret society hopes to clone Christ to create the devil's child, the Antichrist.  Unfortunately, the movie proliferates the feminist myth which arose as a heresy in the Middle Ages and is expounded in the book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ that Jesus Christ had a child by Mary Magdalene.  Such counter-church myths are really largely responsible for the breakup of Christendom and the decline of traditional Christianity.  The Apocalypse is being heralded in by the Priory of Sion, not by the Catholic Church - Christ's true Church - which has stood fast in its resolute opposition to the growing force of secret societies.",1050537600,3,919,4.828025477707007

1828168,2,B000087F13,"To one who has studied ancient and medieval history, and is also a Freemason, that knows the true history of the fraternity, the movie fails in all factuality. They cherry picked a few incorrect accounts of history, and then bent them until they broke. This is especially true, by what is being said about the Templars, who were accused by an indebted and corrupt king, of heresy, and were proven to be none the such. The Vatican, itself, admitted to the travesty.

In Freemasonry, we have investigated whether the Templars ever played a role in the fraternity, and there is no factual evidence that we can find, that says it did. Freemasonry uses their tale in an allegory, for a play, and nothing more. There is no factual evidence that any Tenplars escaped from France, between 1307 and 1312, to Britain. There's even no factual evidence that says Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, was a real Templar, since he was born 100 years too late.

The movie is fiction, and tells no real truth, especially about real Freemasonry and the Templars.",1434067200,,1042,4.71978021978022
1828169,4,B000087F13,"First thing you need to know is that this movie has very little to do with the bible. This is more about the Knight's Templar and all the things hidden in codes and secrecy. I enjoyed the acting in this film, especially the elders in this story. This movie is a mix of the past with the present in an attempt to corrupt the future for all mankind. I also need to say that there needs to be a part two for this film because when it ends, you know that the story is not finished. There is suspense and intrigue to keep you interested throughout the whole film. And there is a little action also. If you like mystery, you will like this.",1408665600,,634,4.120967741935484

1828171,5,B000087F13,"The film is well made and the acting is well worth the time to view the film.  There are parts of the story line with which I do not agree.  Of course, that is my opinion.",1372636800,,171,3.7222222222222223
1828172,2,B000087F13,"Like so many movies of this genre, most of the film was spent chasing clue after clue from church to church, and it's been done better by others. It is my opinion  this film would have been just as good, if not better, were it to have sent the protagonists directly to the ending location and spent the rest of the time focusing in on the antagonists' plotting. As it stood, the first parts of the film were unnecessarily confusing, and some clarification before the denoument would have been appreciated.

But if you can fast forward through all the gratuitous gore and computer-generated-pentacles-superimposed-on-Earth scenes, the ending isn't at all bad: the secret of the Loculus was an interesting surprise, the one sex-scene was more erotic than sleazy (and for once, essential to the plot), and the final ending rather disturbing, in a thought-provoking sort of way.

All in all, not a total waste of time, but not exactly a film one would wish to re-watch in its entirety.",1270944000,,981,4.8273809523809526
1828173,2,B000087F13,"Some beautiful views of France, England, and Malta, and a well done musical score can't save this movie which suffers from very poor storytelling.  Jumping from place to place and scene to scene but not fully connecting the dots, I soon quit caring about plot or characters, replete with illogical actions and unexplained phenomenon.  That's unfortunate because the core premise of finding some of Jesus' DNA is intriguing.  But there's just too many inconsistencies that prevent a plausible story here.  A side note; the title, Revelation, references the last book of the Christian bible, but the story only marginally draws from this source, and combines with it ideas of occultism, alchemy, and ancient & modern science to create its own take on the ""second coming of Christ"".  Also, the ending is wide open for a sequel (but 9 years later, there's nothing on the horizon that I can see).",1267401600,,891,4.953020134228188
1828174,5,B000087F13,"This had a Da Vinci Code feel, though it was out before it... and was MUCH better. It was easily understandable, and a fun ride. There are moments you definately don't see coming, and the story itself is a great idea. It's low tech, and all the cgi and such, is really beleiveable. Nothing over powers in this film. It is a good old fashioned character peice. You can get attached to them, and still be pulled deep into the story without too many effects or computer images. I highly enjoyed this film. James D'Arcy is definately an unrated actor. He was very good in this.",1192579200,2,573,4.415094339622642
1828175,1,B000087F13,"I must give the writers of this film credit for having a wild imagination, but apart from that they had little but some all to familiar conspiracy theories.  Apart from the decent cinematography the film was horrible.  How many times do I have to hear about Mary of Magdala and Christ being married?  I have had far too many conversations correcting people who thought Dan Brown had his facts right and for that matter the recent James Cameron ""documentary"" had more holes in it than Swiss cheese.
Okay, so this is fiction but not particularly good fiction at that.
  The film is also quite violent.  Some very well-made films such as ""Glory"" or ""The Passion of the Christ"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" are very violent.  Unfortunantly, ""Revelation"" is not a well-acted masterpiece.
  As for a new ""messiah"" being conceived on the floor of church/pagan temple on Patmos, that was particularly cheesy.  The conspiracy theories involving the Catholic Church, Isaac Newton, and various organizations are growing a bit old as well.",1185494400,4,1023,4.964705882352941

There are slight hints of the Ninth Gate (starring Johnny Depp) and the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of the Da Vinci Code so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.
It's an adventure that includes some pretty exciting and exotic locations such as Britain, France, Greece, and Malta.
In short, the acting and the dialogues are extremely weak, while the plot and the setting, are really very good, therefore, the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers could... act and write!
Overall, though not a masterpiece, it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!
In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!",1137196800,13,1083,5.044692737430168
1828193,4,B000087F13,"An alternate title for this film could've been, 'Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About The Occult But Was Afraid To Ask.'

All joking aside, the real strength of this film is found in director Stuart Urban's admirable effort to incorporate over 2,000 years of esoteric and occult teachings into one unified plot. So much information in one film; early pagan practices, primal male/female energy systems, ley lines forming a transcontinental power grid connecting sacred sites, the role of Mary Magdalene and the grail in Christian esotericism, alchemical symbology and magical formulations, astrological calculations and the planet Venus, secret societies (the Knights Templar), reincarnation and a myriad of other occultic associations coalesce into the image of a small ornately decorated box known as the Loculus. Combine all this with modern day scientific DNA discoveries and you have the basic storyline of 'Revelation.'

Another real plus in this production is the on-location shooting at such wonderful sacred sites as the Rennes-le-Chateau in France and the island of Malta in the Mediterranean. The imagery found in the paintings, sculpture and mosaics in these very early Christian churches will serve as a rather rude awakening to those in Western Christianity who are unaware of how deep and inseparable the connections were between first and second century Christianity, the old ways of paganism and the underground stream of occultism.

Fine performances by James D'Arcy and Natasha Wightman as Jake and Mira (SPOILER: or should I say Jesus and Mary Magdalene). Also featuring Udo Kier as the Grand Master and Terence Stamp as Magnus Martel. The 'Revelation' serves as a good companion piece and prerequisite for those planning to see 'The Da Vinci Code.'",1133049600,6,1773,5.347670250896058
1828194,4,B000087F13,"In order to apreciate this type of film, one does need to have a bit of a foundation in the metyphysical, some history of the Knights Templar and a wee bit of what Roman torture was about. As with all things in this world, there are the two streams, that of good and of course, evil, which of course is conveyed in all movies, including life.

Another reviewer made a comment on the Church, and unfortunately, many associate churchianity, with the real Christianity that Christ taught,  which are two totally separate streams of thought.  Christ was very simple, he wore basic linen, and not the red silk regalia and fineries found in the Vatican and on the Cardinals & Pope. Let me move to say that the story of Troy was thought to be ""just a story"", until the real treasures were actually unearthed.  Therefore, it can also be possible that the Book of Revelation and its mysteries, will too, eventually unfold, but to those whom are spiritually evolved to hear it.  I prefer keeping an open, positive mind to all.

Overall, we thought the film to be rather interesting, but sadly it only touched on certain facets of the Templars and the Apocrypha, which again is why one needs to have some exposure to it prior to viewing this film.

As with many things...Careful consideration must be given prior to handing over the ""Philosoper's Stone""/information, as they are both equal in power.",1107734400,5,1388,4.68724279835391
1828195,3,B000087F13,"Revelation (2001) is one of those movies that you enjoy as long as you don't think too much about the logic behind it. Almost two hours can be easily spent with this film, although it's not one of those movies you remember much about afterwards.

Revelation is the story of an ancient relic known as Loculus which dates back to the time of Jesus Christ. The good forces has battled the evil through the centuries and the final solution is going to take place in present day. Lord Martel (Terence Stamp, ""The Limey"") has eventually got a hold of Loculus to unlock the artifact's mystery that no one has managed to solve.

When the Loculus is sent to be hidden for all time, some people want to get hold of it again. James D'Arcy (""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"") plays Martel's son who has to fulfill his father's last wish. Udo Kier (""Blade"") is the leader of an ancient order who has a whole different purpose for the artifact. This leads to a race around Mediterranean in Europe for clues to find Loculus.

Revelation is something of a cross between thrilling adventure and religious mumbo jumbo. Despite parallels to Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" it was earlier released with less artistic and commercial success. The director Stuart Urban has managed to create some stylish visual contribution, but also a lot of unexplained storylines and passable special effects. Udo Kier gives once again a good performance as the leader of the order. One might just wonder how many times has Kier played this kind of a role before...

1828196,4,B000087F13,"Along similar lines to Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, and Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, comes this fascinating film about secret orders, sacred symbolism, The Knights Templar and the coming apocalypse. Ultimately this story is about the perpetual battle between good and evil. It is hinted in the film that `a' secret order runs the planet, influencing every aspect of our culture from the highest hierarchies in government to the Vatican. The race is on to find a sacred relic that has existed since the death of Christ. What the relic actually is and the secrets it guards and the power it possesses, depending who owns it, will determine the future of the planet.

In terms of actual production value, cinematography, direction, acting and real locations from England, France and the Greek islands, one couldn't hope for anything better. It is apparent that a good deal of money, work and time went into the making this film. Interestingly, it also did not receive the fanfare that most films of this calibre do. Whether it is the film's subject matter that might well offend the more religiously orthodox movie-goer or simply the distributors didn't see it as a winner at the time of its release, your guess is as good as mine. Whatever the reason, Revelation is a good film, suspenseful, intriguing and realistic.

If you're that type of person who enjoys religious conspiracy theories and the occult, combined with a tight story line that intrigues as well as entertains, this is the movie to see. Revelation is a solid piece of filmmaking.",1099267200,3,1551,4.916030534351145

1828198,2,B000087F13,"Revelation (Stuart Urban, 2001)
TV director Stuart Urban comes up with his second feature film. Generally mindless stuff, but topical and easily watchable enough to kill two hours with.
Magnus Martel (Terence Stamp) is a very rich man in possession of a very rare, in fact one of a kind, item; a holy relic called the Loculus. No one knows, exactly, what the Loculus is used for, but in the course of the opening scenes, we find out many people have died for it over this years, and that it came eventually to rest in the hands of the Knights Templar, led by a mysterious grand master played by Udo Kier (Suspiria, Shadow of the Vampire). In order to try and figure out what it's sued for, Martel calls in his estranged son Jake (James D'Arcy, recently seen in Master and Commander), a cryptographer, along with a team of other professionals. Except that somewhere along the way, it seems Magnus crossed the (still-alive after three hundred years) grand master, who's out to reclaim the Loculus.
The bulk of the film details Jake's attempts to find out where Magnus has hidden it, aided by Mira (Natasha Wightman of Gosford Park fame), another member of the team, and his old warrior-turned-priest friend Ray (Liam Cunningham, who showed up in the most recent Prime Suspect). All along the way, they have to dodge invisible Templars, the military, various packs of mad animals, and the like. Typical adventure fare, but with the religious twist recently popularized by books like The DaVinci Code. Will probably be forgotten in a few years, and deservedly; none of the ast here gives an outstanding performance, the writing is middle-of-the-road, etc. But as I said, if you've got a couple of hours to kill, there are worse ways to spend it. ** ",1072051200,2,1745,4.759075907590759

I was struck by the similar feel of the stories and heartily recommend this movie to anyone who has read the Robert Langdon novels by Dan Brown.  If they ever get around to turning Dan Brown's books into movies, I don't think you could find a more perfectly suited director than Stuart Urban. Revelation shows he has a feel for the style and understanding of the content. Great flick!",1071360000,8,521,4.725274725274725
1828200,2,B000087F13,"The film's title ""Revelation"" comes from the Bible, and this occult thriller film, it seems, tells us that there still remains a box named The Locutus somewhere in Europe, and the two religious sects are seeking for it desperately for the reason you stop caring in the last minutes of the story.
Jake Martel (James D'Arcy) is a disgraced computer expert who had been in jail.  Now released, he is invited to join in the searching team led by Magnus Martel (Terence Stamp), his very rich father, who wants to get the secret of a box the Locutus hidden for years.  But soon they come to realize that they have to handle dangerous cult group, of which leader The Grand Master (Udo Kier) has no hesitation to do whatever he has to do in order to secure the box for his own cause.
To be fair, the film's concept has some potential.  For example, we have seen it done gracefully in Harrison Ford's ""Raiders,"" but the film chose to be more intelligent and philosophical ... so to speak.  There is no action or car chase; instead, you get several gory scenes and tortures, none of which are particularly impressive.  It is quite strange, however, that though the Grand Master's army can attack the security-tight office/lab of the Martels with ease, they are always one step behind the two leading hero/heroine.
The role of Terence Stamp is little more than a cameo, so the film is virtually young James D'Arcy's.  That's a problem for he is not ready for the job, and co-starring Natasha Wightman, though better than him, is just so-so.  Inexplicably, we have another cameo from Derek Jacobi as the librarian, whose intended comic relief is not comic relief at all.
You can see and hear many, many historical and religious items, such as alchemist, Knight Templars, and so on, but they add up to nothing, all assembled in a messy way.  And the conclusion of the film is a surprise, indeed, but may look offensive to some (or many) Christians.  But it is also so incredible that it is hardly possible for any of us to take it seriously.
The film's globe-trotting story gives a good chance to see many places in Europe, all of which are shot beautifully, but that doesn't mean that we are interested in the mystery which the film is trying to show in a clithed and far-fetched way (like dots on the map).

  For folks who have their own theories or conjectures about end time events... the conception of a new christ by a Wiccan priestess on top of a Star of David floor mosaic, is probably not one of the more popular ones.
The chick did have a nice bum though.
  There was something about the movie though that did raise some interesting points.  The struggle for power using Christ as a tool rings true for nearly 2000 years.",1064275200,11,852,4.451612903225806

Shocking and at the same time thought-provoking. but these, and the presence of Terence Stamp and Derek Jacobi are the only star worthy aspects of the movie.

because storyline and scripting are weak... before you read further, beware of some moviespoilers in this paragraph!!!  weakness: storyline lead characters are made out to be reincarnations of Mary Magdalene and Jesus, they  look the same way they did from 2 K years before, they will birth the returning Christ... wasn't played out convincingly enough in the script or the acting.

semi-strength: the desire to know what the Loculus, the central item of great interest and conspiracy, is the device of the story that is supposed to keep us hooked into the movie until the end...

weakness: quickie pre-climax story line--- choppy feeling scenes about blood and tissue residue ...cloning... floating baby in a tank... orphan left on steps of Vatican...evil cardinal raises Antichrist... needed more thought and depth on the part of the scriptwriter... too many holes in that treatment.

special effects... although i appreciate the efforts put into the special effects (as evidenced by making-of docu),  their overall effect is rather 2nd rate.

again, the presentation  of various symbolism, pagan ties of Christianity's beginnings and divisions, planet Venus' path in the sky, feminine and masculine principles of Divine, secret societies, little-heard-of( that is, to us Western Christians in the U.S.) early and medieval Christian sites and traditions in the mediteranean were the star aspects of this movie.  for these little-known facts pointed out that there is more to Christianity's history and its development than the mainstream U.S. has since known and accepted so far, far away from the land and time of the Man known to be the Christ.

If you want to discover more facts along these lines, AND if you want a better, more satisfying storyline experience with these same sort of Christian curiosities and facts then try reading the book Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.
