6656642,5,B00NH1G27O,"4 1/2 STARS FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY, THOUGH NOT PERFECT, BORGIA SERIES  -- & WHY YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A CHANCE -- FINAL SEASON 3 RELEASED IN EUROPE 29 OCT 2014
SEASON TWO SYNOPSIS NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW ***I will not give anything away for those who have yet to watch the series***

IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY OF THE BORGIA: It is considered one of the most infamous chapters in the history of Italy and the Papal States.  It is the time of Machiavelli, Michelangelo, Medici and Da Vinci. It is the enlightenment of the renaissance, yet great depravity and lawlessness.  This series picks up with Spanish Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia as he vies to become the eventual Pope Alexander the Sixth and elevate his family into a dynasty that will influence the whole world.  Political intrigue, dark family secrets, and great ambitions of state - all form a natural structure for this partially fictionalized tale.

STUDIOCANAL vs SHOWTIME:  This Borgia version from StudioCanal was perhaps lost in the US for two reasons.  #1 is that the outstanding Showtime version beat them to the punch.  #2 is that the performance of lead actor John Doman is a little uneven (I am being kind) and some have applied that performance unfairly to the rest of the production.  To be certain, the Showtime Borgias is superior in production values, budget, glam, and star power.  Adding a-z, Showtime's Borgias is the better show and many will argue that point while hating this show.  However, there are many points to this show that actually excel individually beyond the Showtime production and make it legitimately many other people's favorite version (""favorite"" being a more subjective term).  This show is slightly more authentic than ""Borgias"" in that it follows the Borgia history a little more accurately (though still changed at times).  The cast is more European and manage something closer to Italian and Catalan accents when they are not actual Italians or Spaniards to begin with.  Some filming is done in the Czech Republic, but much is also done in Italy.  The palaces are every bit as extraordinary and lavish; the settings gorgeous and epic;  the filming and cinematography exceptional; and the supporting cast absolutely fantastic and equal to any other Borgia productions.  The acting outside of Doman really is outstanding if you just give it a chance.

SEASON TWO:  Many of the darkest rumors about the Borgia family are realized in this season (whether they are true or not).  This series certainly is less afraid to tread deep within the more salacious speculations about the Borgia family.  It is equally brutal, sexual, and graphic as the Showtime version, if not more so.  Cesare and his father Pope Alexander further their boundless ambition to see Cesare not only a king, but an Emperor.  They desire to set him as the eventual ruler of a unified Italy, but there is a long road of conquest and political alliance required for that seemingly impossible fantasy.  The siblings Cesare and Lucrezia take a more central role in season two as they come into their own.  Lucrezia is particularly interesting as she finds the source of her own power and displays talents and responsibility in her own style.  Cesare is sent to deal with the extremist monk Savonarola who has opposed the pope and transformed intellectual and artistic Florence into an ultra-religious state where ""Bonfires of the Vanities"" destroy anything that opposes his view of God's will.  In a little role reversal, La Belle Giulia Farnese will need the help of her cardinal brother to maintain her relationship as mistress of the pope.

SEASON THREE FOLLOWS!  As I mentioned above, there is a third and final season released on video in Europe 29, Oct 2014.  Now that the show is known in the US, hopefully it will be available a lot quicker than this season was.  I don't plan on waiting for the US release anyway.  Don't let one mediocre performance dissuade you from this very excellent production.  It was different enough for me to watch both the Borgia and Showtime's Borgias in close succession and I loved them both!  You may find more charm and authenticity in this series.  I highly recommend it (for mature audiences only).",1413590400,13,4206,4.874647887323944
6656643,5,B00NH1G27O,"Great seasons but getting them to release is like pulling teeth! I have been asking for this forever but neither Amazon or Canal made it easy to find. What is wrong with these people who are selling this? Season 3 comes to Netflix this winter but will it be another three years before I can own it. Help those of us that like the series and send it to dvd/Blu ray... stop holding on to it for so long.

This series puts the Showtime series to shame, the wonderful way Doman plays the pope is nothing less than awesome. His sons are priceless and his daughter is cast to the perfect woman. Its a terrible story on many levels but this is the best!",1412553600,15,646,4.209677419354839
6656644,1,B00NH1G27O,Little disappointing - purchased the DVD set whilst visiting the U.S. on return to Australia three of the DVDs freeze - regularly. The show itself is very good.,1429315200,,160,4.75
6656645,2,B00NH1G27O,"When I purchased this DVD set, I either failed to notice, or failed to understand, the notation which states ""DVD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com.""  In the event, what I received was not the usual, normal-looking, silver DVDs but purple-colored DVDs.  When I played these on my Oppo Blu-Ray player, the sound was fine but, for some disks, the picture would pulsate between a high pixel count and a low pixel count i.e. low resolution blocks of color.
I paid $17.98 for the set, so I didn't waste a lot of money, but it has been a learning experience for me.  The price of education.  In future, I will be on the look out for, and avoid, any DVD sets that are advertised as ""manufactured on demand"".  I guess its like those new ""Print-on-Demand"" books - they are rubbish too!
I quite like the series (although I think the Jeremy Irons version is better) so I purchased a PAL set on Blu-Ray disks from Amazon Italia.  Needless to say the picture and sound are about a million times better!",1426809600,,1031,4.545945945945946

Some minor spoilers

For the most part I found this season to be intelligent, beautiful and dignified. It's a sumptuous feast for the eyes and in many ways takes you back to the time, with all its beauties and horrors. And by the last episodes of this season I finally reconciled myself to the fact that if you don't expect historical accuracy, then you can just enjoy the show for what it is: visually stunning and entertaining, and merely ""based on a true story."" The narrative does in fact stay close to many of the main events, though they play with the timeline and of course invent and adapt. I loved the scene of the trial by fire, which is what happened in a nutshell. Lucrezia looks like a Boticelli and has a gracious, youthful nobility. Cesare looks like the famous painting of him, and his portrayal is sympathetic yet complex. I also like their interpretation of Machiavelli: ""morality is fine but when compelled you must know the ways of evil and have the mettle to employ them."" Piero Soderini looks like he comes from noble blood. I enjoyed season one but think season two is even better. The characters have grown into themselves; the storytelling is well paced, and the dress, sets and lighting are all visually seductive (lots of candle light). The arc of Cesare's story is great, but I found the pope's mixed (some good aspects, some ridiculous ones). I was loving season 2 until episode 6 which brings back some of the soap operatic elements. To me, a 15 second scene were the pope kills three prostitutes does not make the show more interesting or exciting, but rather seems like poor characterization. Likewise that the pope and his mistress descend into drug addiction seems a very out of place subplot (and was there even a shred of truth to it?).

As a side note, maybe there were incestuous relations between Cesare and his sister or maybe they were lies spread by enemies, but whenever it occurs in either this or the Showtime version I find it completely unconvincing.

Overall, I found that this season began strongly, went a bit askew in the middle and then returned to form for the final excellent episodes. And in the final episode I also finally noticed how good the music is in this show.",1425772800,,2230,4.637974683544304

Just love it!",1422144000,,37,4.428571428571429
6656653,5,B00NH1G27O,"For me, it is impossible to try to compare Borgia and The Borgias. Both are excellent and aside from the subject matter, very different. I first watched The Borgias and absolutely loved it. I stumbled upon this presentation and thanks to some informative reviews, I had to leap - and so glad I did.

In some other reviews, much has been made about the ""accent issue,"" most specifically John Doman's American accent. Because his accent is so different from that of the other actors, I did notice it initially, but soon, it didn't matter at all. In fact, I thought John Dorman did an excellent job portraying Rodrigo Borgia and looked so much more like him as well.

As in The Borgias, great detail was taken in costuming and set detail. And, in some of the retelling of stories based in murky facts, some liberties were also taken. Borgia requires much more viewer participation, I think, because there are more characters to keep up with. One thing that struck me about Borgia is how the film-makers portrayed the people, cast and extras. There were men and women of all sizes and physical descriptions. There was tremendous realism in Borgia, all the way through.

After watching The Borgias, it took me a minute to ""accept"" the actors in Borgia, as I am so fond of the ones in the former. What allowed me to enjoy Borgia equally is that these two series are SO completely different. Each one stands by itself and should be appreciated that way. These characters are so interesting and both gave me a completely different understanding and appreciation for the Borgias and their times.

Season 2 marks the transition of Cesare's taking more of the center stage.  Mark Ryder does an amazing job of conveying a calculated,driven man - continually trying to prove his worth to his father - a central theme in both this telling and Showtime's The Borgias. Again, in this season, viewer enjoyment is dependent upon viewer attention.  Unlike in The Borgias, there is a larger context of ever-changing events.  One quick trip to the kitchen or bathroom can result in immediate bewilderment upon return.

Although Season 3 has not yet been released in the US(except via Netflix) on dvd, I can tell you that it is available via Amazon/Francais.  My high school French helped a little in discerning the language options and I gambled that so many of the actors were English-speaking, so I bought it.  Glad I did.  One switch of the audio button on the dvd player and everyone was speaking in English, rather than dubbed-in French.  It is important to note that a region-free dvd player is needed for Season 3.  If one is needed, Amazon US offers a variety of them.  They are inexpensive and invaluable for watching films/tv that haven't made it to US shores.  I will attest that Season 3 is pretty great. The ending is quite surprising and extremely creative.

If you are intrigued by the Borgia family, I recommend BOTH versions of their story. Each paints a different view of the same story and makes a highly entertaining experience in the bargain.",1419638400,,3042,4.743833017077799

6656659,3,B00NH1G27O,"Fantastic series however actor John Doman demonstrates some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It's unfortunate that he was casted in the lead male role. The series would have gotten much better ratings. Casting for Pope Alexander VI is completely wrong. All other actors, FANTASTIC JOB! Would have gotten 5 Stars with a better actor.",1418083200,,335,5.0
6656660,5,B00NH1G27O,"Season 2 of this series was wonderful but I have one important complaint to enter.  The digital copy that I purchased has no close captioning.  The full DVD set, not yet available for region one, does indeed offer close captioning.  Also on Amazon Instant Video, close captioning is an available complement.  I do not know why Amazon chose to manufacture a digital copy of this great historical series without close captioning.  Personally I am not hearing impaired or deaf.  Programs and movies that are spoken in English with heavy Italian, Irish, German and the like accents in my opinion are benefited greatly with the addition of close captioning / subtitles.  I am a viewer that wants to understand every word that is spoken during a movie or program.  I feel badly for people that are deaf or hearing impaired that unknowingly purchased the digital copy available from Amazon and literally would not be able to enjoy its content.  I even placed a call to customer service before ordering the digital copy and the person on the phone could not tell me whether or not close captioning was on it or not.  Customer service should have this data available to them when Amazon customers call with their questions.  Thank you.",1417737600,5,1226,4.818181818181818

8678130,4,B00NH1G27O,"For fans of the Borgia period in history (mature fans, that is; this is most definitely not family-friendly), you might consider this DVD set----bearing in mind that the 'good guys' are frequently bestial and the fast-moving plot may spin your head if you don't pay attention. Unlike the sumptuous and equally-addictive Showtime series--whose tale unfortunately came to an abrupt halt when it was canceled---this one from Canal ties up the story at the end of the third season, and even includes a satisfying recap delivered by the lead actors. As noted in the other reviews, a few liberties are taken with the script, but it generally follows a historical basis--gaining Ultimate Power came (and still does, to this day) at a heavy price. For the Church, at the expense of simple Scriptural teachings: its interweaving of politics and pagan traditions, persecution of ""non-believers"", and moral corruption infest it still. For the Borgias themselves, it was at the expense of family peace and harmony: they loved and hated passionately, gaining immense influence while losing each other to Ambition.  A powerful addition to any historical DVD collection.",1504828800,,1155,5.243243243243243

8678133,5,B00NH1G27O,"Upon first viewing season 1 of Borgia I had a similar reaction to many, I was unsettled by the varied accents and put off by what I perceived as poor acting by Isolda (Lucrezia) among others.  I'm soooo glad I persevered!  After the pope's election the story begins to take shape, the acting improved dramatically, and the accents disappeared.  Season 2 is a masterwork of historical drama with a larger budget and a cast that now owns their charge.  I'm now watching the entire series for the second time just to glisten the details from this deep and incredible plot.

This show made me read books and many articles on the life of Alexander VI and especially the great Cesare Borgia.  It inspired me to want to know the history that surrounded and thus created these amazing characters.  Cesare is a singular man unlike any I've ever studied.  He's derided, loved, feared, hated, vilified, and mocked to the point that we now struggle to know who he was at all.  This show does a lot to present him as a man instead of caricature and Mark Ryder beautifully capture he so propelled by history and circumstance and yet conflicted by family and pride.  By the end of the series I felt like I had witnessed a true tragedy of history.  What an accomplishment!

I love the focus on events surrounding the Papacy and Italy at large.  This is a story about a family but the producers do not shy from the complexities of the day's events, in fact they surround the main characters with many historical figures and give weight to their lives and decisions by immersing them in these events.  It can be a little overwhelming at times but it also adds so much to the representation of the real world the main characters inhabit.

If you like history and good, deep drama, this show is a treasure!!",1451952000,2,1787,4.5579937304075235
