The acting is slightly better than daytime soaps, but it is kinda cute in its own way. I wouldn't recommend it to someone seeking a good film on trans-related topics or drama. It is what it purports to be, a soap-opera.",1260403200,4,322,4.383333333333334
2699970,5,B000L43ANO,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was interesting to watch the relationship between the two main characters (Charlotte and Veronica) develop. You get a good idea of Veronica's relationship with her family and their level of support. While it doesn't delve into Veronica's life outside her apartment, you get a sense of the problems she faces as a TS. Charlotte is an interesting character too.  You see her relationship and acceptance of Veronica as a woman develop right up to the end of the movie.  This is a movie about two people searching for something more in their lives - acceptance, love, and for Veronica the letter that will lead to SRS as well.",1256083200,4,655,4.728070175438597
2699971,4,B000L43ANO,"It takes like it said on the title steps like in a Soap Opera but it takes Your attention, at begining looks like a simple movie, but if You give the time, Ill get You",1239062400,4,167,3.8
2699972,5,B000L43ANO,"This is the story two women, one of whom is transsexual, living in a rather dismal apartment block in Denmark (Danish with English subtitles in the version I watched). It portrays the life of a transsexual woman, Veronica, midway through her transition from male to female - she takes feminizing hormones but has not yet received any approval for sexual reassignment surgery. The story neither oversentimentalizes nor candycoats the transsexual experience. Whoever wrote this either knows transsexual women or has really done their research. The film is very perceptive.

Charlotte, the non-transgendered woman, initially reacts in predictable but unfortunately realistic ways, using the wrong pronoun (addressing ""her"" as ""him""), and being bemused and amused by her wig-wearing neighbor. But as they get to know each other, Charlotte begins to perceive the feminine qualities of Veronica, and the dynamics of the womens' interaction are clearly female-female, but with a transgendered flavor in the mix. The story swings back and forth between Charlotte's life and Veronica's with the emotional twists and turns that life throws at one, mirroring a TV soap opera.

Like many European movies, it is a fine study in emotional dynamics, illuminating some women's experiences (both non-transgendered and transgendered.",1172102400,55,1315,5.57

8160178,5,B000L43ANO,"I liked the movie.  It was a little dark at the end, but to see what transgender people go through, this is a great story.",1469059200,,122,3.88
8160179,4,B000L43ANO,"While this movie could have been a good bit shorter, it was a satisfying drama, if that's what you're looking for. A bit strange and mundane, but that's what makes it special.",1400630400,,175,4.5

8160181,1,B000L43ANO,this is one f****ed up movie.  People should not be allowed to waste film on such garbage.  I get more substance at a 12 step meeting.,1369440000,,134,4.115384615384615
8160182,5,B000L43ANO,"I found the film to be very enjoyable. The MTF transition is a long process and though some are pounding on this film about what came first (the hormones or the permission)take it for what it appears to me to be, an intricate weaving of two lives.",1356825600,,247,4.276595744680851
8160183,5,B000L43ANO,a slow start but the ending was good it's about a crossdresser becoming a transexual..But wished it was in english to under stand what they was saying.,1353628800,,151,4.62962962962963
8160184,1,B000L43ANO,"Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously problematic in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to hit every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer.",1350691200,7,601,5.02
8160185,5,B000L43ANO,Great portrayal of a typical Western existence in solitude. Deals with very complex emotions and can definitely boil down to loneliness and love. Beautiful outline of a complex relationship. ~Wonderful,1345507200,,201,5.733333333333333
8160186,5,B000L43ANO,"There are many ways to judge a movie and everyone has different tastes.  This is a 'different' movie, it's not for those who expect the big dramatic finish.  It is realistic and lovely and it made me reflect on my own life and what my definition of love is, and who it is with.  This gives a perspective I don't often get from most movies.  I recommend this to anyone who likes leaving a movie feeling like they didn't see a movie at all but rather a bit of the human experience from some other person's view. It is a movie to think about, not just mindless garbage.",1313020800,9,566,4.212962962962963
