7918987,5,B00003JRB7,AWESOME MOVIE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.,1494892800,,47,5.0
7918988,5,B00003JRB7,"Just ordered it on DVD and I also ordered the soundtrack. and cannot wait for it to arrive. Great film, very funny and I love it one of my all time fav. films. if you like bride of chucky or scream, watch this movie because it spoofs slasher films but at the same time it is a slasher film, and a good one at that.",1373155200,,314,3.8461538461538463
7918989,2,B00003JRB7,"Troma is an amazing film company. I can understand that most people would get offended at the films, there are sometimes over the top. This film was not as good as it could have been. It was funny in some areas but didn't hold together well. The soundtrack when the killer was around was funny but other then that, the movie was not that speical. The ending was stupid.",1190246400,,369,4.36231884057971
7918990,2,B00003JRB7,"So it was funny, I guess. The point is that they're all stupid, and we get to kind of have fun letting them be stupid and run around the woods. I get it, I should say... fun! Yeah...

I don't know, I think a few things in this were pretty creative, mostly the different type of stuff the killer did and the whole side-story involving the transvestite. I also like the references to Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Deliverance (at this point, can you even have a killer woodsman story without said references?). Also, the whole duct tape thing was a great motif.

I actually think the funniest and most interesting part of the movie was the credits, though. Wardrobe provided by Wal-Mart. Yeah, good stuff.

7918991,5,B00003JRB7,I first saw the trailer for this movie when I bought Cannibal the Musical. That was about 3 years ago and I've wanted to see it since then. I just watched this movie and I have to say it was grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat! If you are a fan of Troma then this movie is for you. It has your usual dark morbid sence of humor. Beating people with severed arms and using a guys head as a dummy. I highly recommend giving this movie a watch.,1078185600,4,423,4.0476190476190474
7918992,5,B00003JRB7,"This movie has it all: blood, guts , duct tape and a hardcore soundtrack. You see 7 friends go camping and there is a killer on the loose. Every time he cuts off a body part, the victom duct tapes it back on, that is hilarious. Also on the soundtrack is Hatebreed, Strife, H20, among other good HC bands. i would sugust you to buy this film!!!!!!",1019347200,,346,4.17910447761194
7918993,3,B00003JRB7,"Decampitated! is just what you'd expect from a movie of this title. It's packed with cheesy gore, token nudeness and all-out camp. If you're a fan of the Toxic Avenger, Blood Hook, Class of Nuke 'Em High and the like, you  won't be disappointed. If you're not a fan of the previously mentioned,  however, might want to skip on toward Remains of the Day.",961632000,4,353,4.5
