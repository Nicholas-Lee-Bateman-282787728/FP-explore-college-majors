2946269,5,B000VOEF2Y,"When will they ever put this awesome animated movie on to DVD or Blu Ray ???  It's been way too long.  I haven't seen it since I was kid in the early 80s.  I used to watch every chance I could.  We didn't get our first VCR until the late 80s, so never had the chance to record it.  I have a neice and two nephews who would love to see this for the first time.  If they like it half as much as I do... it will be the best gift I give them all year.  I have many friends asking me about this very same issue.  Some company, please distribute this classic family movie classic !!!",1348185600,,577,3.830508474576271
2946270,5,B000VOEF2Y,"An awesome animation with great music that looks just as good as it did in the 80's when I saw it.  Kids should be able to really enjoy it from 6 on up, there's nothing scary in it, and its a great tool to get them ready to enjoy the Olympics.  Lots of humor and entertainment for adults as well.  This german version includes the full original English version.

Note - this is a European format (PAL TV format) DVD and will not play in most pure DVD players here in the U.S. (or on our old standard definition TV's) both of which use the NTSC standard definition TV format which is, you guessed it, different than European PAL format.  This is because the media company that has the rights to it in the U.S. hasn't and won't release a DVD version of it.

So what can you use to play this?  Computer will play it (windows XP loaded it fine).  Xbox 360 on a U.S. High Definition TV plays it great, as I just tested it on that combination (although the Xbox 360 DVD player has always received low marks for its performance in general).  I've heard the PS3 does not play it, Sony enforcing region limitations.  It will play on the High Definition TiVo devices (uploaded from computer), not sure about Apple TV.

For the TV (if your not watching it on your computer) you will need a High Definition TV (or a European PAL format standard definition TV).

This is a great little movie - one that your kids will love and want to watch over and over.  The animators and director etc. from this movie ended up spreading out into Tron, the Simpson's, Iron Gian, The Incredibles, The Lion King and on and on...showing the talent that was involved in making this little movie.  It is a made in 1979 animation so expect as much, but the quality of the DVD is very good as its a genuine release.  This is the best we'll do here in the U.S., if you want to see it, as there hasn't been and won't be a U.S. release (which is a crime).",1344816000,4,1918,4.245179063360881
2946271,5,B000VOEF2Y,"Think of this as a more mature verison of Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics. No Disney style good vs evil,no cartoony cheating,no silly team names & no pointless cameo appearance from other cartoon stars up to our ears. The animation is first-rate. It also has a nice slow pace so we can get to know the cast better. The jokes and puns are hit-and-miss at best. A nice spoof on the Olympics. The only downside is how the footrace between Rene & Kit ended. It was one of the dumbest things I ever saw but not enough to rag this movie down. It's still a good/fun movie to watch. I give this film a 9 out of 10.",1335139200,,607,4.241379310344827
2946272,3,B000VOEF2Y,"The DVD they sell of this movie claims to be region free. And in some technical sense it may be, but it wouldn't play on my PS3(American). It plays fine on my computer though. Also, why the hell does this cost $40? I paid it anyway, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth $40. Glad I found it though. This movie brings back good memories!

If you have kids, buy this movie!",1321574400,2,379,4.263888888888889
