5643755,4,B00BLN4V6E,"The transfer and sound presentation are quite good. Supplements are limited, but aren't really missed. A good comedy movie. Jumping Jack Flash is showing its age. Since most of the movie revolves around Terri and Jack conversing on computers, the computers easily date the movie. It is still very watchable and quite funny. Sit back, suspend disbelief, and laugh your butt off.",1376524800,,377,5.096774193548387
5643756,5,B00BLN4V6E,"This film is one whoopi's, greatest films when she first started! Its got it all, comedy, action, suspense and if you don't already like them after all these years of them being around, it might even make you a fan of the Rolling Stones! Enjoy.",1376179200,7,244,4.444444444444445
5643757,3,B00BLN4V6E,"This movie as far as I am concerned is a classic and captures Whoopi Goldberg at her comedic best.  Her timing and responses as a bank teller thrown into the spy world of cloak and dagger is both hysterical and makes for a good adventure.  In addition, this film also portrays the first aspects of instant messaging and online communications.  Lastly, if I am not mistaken, I believe this is Penny Marshall's directional debut in motion pictures.  Therefore why only a three star rating?

This DVD produced by Anchor Bay is rather disappointing.  There is absolutely nil in the form of special features, no trailer/preview for this feature (any other films), no documentaries and no commentary, which honestly wouldn't bother me if the DVD itself had a menu screen.  When you put the disk in the DVD player a screen pops up and states if subtitles are desired to hit the ""subtitle"" button on your remote control.  When the movie begins it does have a rather clear widescreen presentation, but coming from a company like Anchor Bay this is rather second-rate.

I can recall becoming very excited when some of my favorite obscure films would be released by Anchor Bay.  Mainly because Anchor Bay usually pulls out the stops on their DVD releases, extra features, trailers, radio spots, interviews, etc. This 2013 DVD release is abysmal. Nevertheless, I am happy to have this great movie on DVD and will be keeping it in my collection.  However, Anchor Bay really needs be ashamed of themselves about this release.  For the first time ever, I am going to be thinking twice about buying future Anchor Bay releases.",1371081600,11,1610,4.8145454545454545
5643758,2,B00BLN4V6E,"Loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater, have had a soft spot for it since. When I saw it was coming to blu, I got excited and immediately pre-ordered it. Received it in the mail today and...wow...am I disappointed. I see no real difference in the video from the DVD (some, but not much)...the sound is a little better...but what is the WORST thing is that this is not just a ""bare bones"" blu ray...there isn't even a MENU. The movie starts right up...nothing when you hit the ""menu"" button or anything. There is NOTHING but the movie. This is the 2nd Anchor Bay blu ray that I have purchased with this happening (not even a freaking MENU...the other was ""The Entity"")...what is going on with this? How much can it cost to provide a menu with chapter stops or something...ANYTHING? This will be the last Anchor Bay blu ray purchase for me.

2 stars because I DO still like the movie, but dang...the blu ray release of ""Jumpin Jack Flash"" is the crap crap crap.",1369699200,30,972,4.4

5643841,5,B00BLN4V6E,"I have always loved this movie. But it does have some language if you don't like that sort of thing. Ms. Goldberg is rather infamous for that mouthy sassiness, laced with colorful expletives.  She did an awesome job in this movie however.  She was almost endearing as Terry Doolittle, a very intelligent bank worker who uses a computer to transfer funds. She has a higher than average ability with the technical nuances of computers and manages to intercept a coded message from someone calling themselves Jumpin' Jack Flash. What follows is pure insanity for poor Terry.  Annie Potts was lovely as the wife of Jack's friend , lending the plot a comfortable feel.  A few other supporting cast members that should be mentioned are, Carol Kane as  Terry's flirty co-worker, the always funny Jon Lovitz, another co-worker, and bank manager Peter Michael Goetz as the boss we all have had once. Jon Wood as Jeremy Talbot, was perfectly cast.  I must also mention that this movie was directed by Penny Marshall (Laverne & Shirley)  I've never been disappointed by any movie she directed.

Stephen Collins was just great to look at, and Jonathan Pryce was perfect--well, I won't give it away.  You'll like this movie.  I highly recommend it for a rainy weekend movie night.",1464307200,3,1267,4.851162790697674

5643848,5,B00BLN4V6E,"Other commentators have criticised the bare-bones nature of this release; whilst it's true that this release is the movie and nothing more, I can't help but wonder what justication that is for marking it down. This is not a mainstream-popularity release and by virtue of its subject matter it has dated badly. I bought it for the sake of nostalgia; I can't imagine many people would actively seek it out for any other reason. We're lucky it got a Bluray release. I don't care about getting documentaries, commentaries, trailers, or extras - yes, they would've been nice, but what I principally care is getting a good-quality transfer of a childhood favourite. And that's what I got.

This BluRay is NOT an upscale from DVD, nor is it poor quality. The transfer isn't going to set the world on fire; clearly the projected sales of this movie do not make an extensive - and expensive - restoration worthwhile - but it's a decent, clean transfer from a good quality 35mm print. Levels of grain are occasionally high but detail is overall good, colour balance is good, and blacks are inky and deep. The sound mix is exactly what you'd expect from a film from 1986. This film was not made yesterday; it was made thirty years ago. It is what it is. :)",1457740800,3,1245,4.608108108108108

5643935,1,B00BLN4V6E,"Whoopi Goldberg's Debut film and Director Penny marshal's Directorial Debut JUMPIN' JACK FLASH
is still very funny today as it was on VHS tape
being Whoopi Goldberg's first film her performance is incredible
every scene she is in, she steals
she was originally a stand up comedian up there on the list with Eddie Murphy
the fashion is out ofcourse, but really Good storyline, Acting and Directing
but i tell you not Bad acting with her performance in her first film
and not bad Directing from Penny marshal's first Directing Job
Definitely on the list of the 80'S best Action comedies

this new blu-ray of the film from Anchor bay is terrible
Anchor bay did not give this film the respect it deserves, the picture quality is terrible
it's the same as the Anchor bay dvd release from over 5 years ago
the Audio quality is the same to
the dvd release had no special features, nothing
so i thought this new blu-ray release would have some new extras
like a new retrospective featurette with Whoopi Goldberg & Penny marshal at least
or a new Audio commentary by both Whoopi and Penny
but tragically no, nothing, just the usual Theatrical trailer
it's obvious Anchor bay didn't bother contacting Whoopi or Penny at all
about giving an interview for this classic 80's film, tragic this blu-ray is not worth nothing waste of money

i'm staying with my old dvd release until a better blu-ray release with new special features comes along
if it does, but don't hold your breath
this movie deserves 4-5 stars for sure
this blu-ray is only worth 1 star. disgusting insult from Anchor bay",1417305600,5,1576,4.6859205776173285

I laughed and cried through this movie, and was amazed to see how timeless it is. Some movies that seemed good way back when, are now ""retro"" and seem stilted or out of touch with the present. Not this one! Even with its obvious use of banking technology that depicts a time with CRT tubes and very era-centric corporate paradigms, this movie feels like watching an entertaining historical account of an amazing bank employee who risked her life and career to save a stranger.

5643971,5,B00BLN4V6E,"Even though I have always thought the ending is a little smarmy, I have always liked this movie, because it is just FUN.  Whoopie, is as always, brilliant and hilarious, and she and the rest of the cast has made this a movie that never fails to make me chuckle most of the way through it, and in places, laugh out loud.  And, the movie ends just as it should, smarmy or not...",1396224000,,376,4.136986301369863

5643973,4,B00BLN4V6E,"Whoopi is in rare form here, and is so very funny.  But, when she tells off Lady What's-her-name she gets right to the point, no comedy, just the facts.  Loved it when she finally meets jack, the look on her face is priceless.",1394668800,,226,4.232558139534884

5643977,5,B00BLN4V6E,This is a great movie with Whoopi Goldberg. It is a great family flick that is clean and cute flick.,1393632000,,100,4.05
5643978,5,B00BLN4V6E,Whoopi is great in this comedy turned cold war espionage film.  You'll laugh again and again at her antics.  Contains some adult language so be careful with kids but otherwise very entertaining for adult audiences.,1392422400,,214,5.085714285714285
5643979,3,B00BLN4V6E,Good movie but the language has much to be desired.  Has funny parts throughout the movie but the language turned me off.  Seems like some of the movies Whoopi Goldberg is in just turns me off with the vulgarity in it.  Needs to clean up her mouth,1391904000,,247,4.212765957446808
5643980,5,B00BLN4V6E,This is a movie that I grew up watching. I will never forget all the memories as a teenager watching this. I like the fact that you don't her Jack's voice until Whoopi hears it on his voicemail and then connects the voice with the writer.,1391558400,,238,4.195652173913044

5643992,5,B00BLN4V6E,Don't ever start watching this movie unless you have time to finish it.  You will NOT be able to stop in the middle.  It grabs you right at the beginning and doesn't let go.,1383696000,,173,4.0588235294117645

I highly recommend it!!",1380672000,,100,3.8095238095238093
5643996,5,B00BLN4V6E,"I was so happy to find this movie in widescreen here at Amazon for such a reasonable price. This has been one of my favorite movies for years and I can't tell you how many times I've watched it. If you've never seen it (I can't imagine many of you haven't) then you're in for a real treat. Whoopi is at her best and funniest here. That Jack sure was a lucky guy to have her in his corner. ""Mick Mick....Speak English!"" and ""I'm a little black woman in a big silver box"" are two of my favorite lines from the movie. Jumpin' Jack Flash has many laughs, fun, and adventures in it. If you're not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg  I think you will be after you see this movie. Jim Belushi is great and so are the British actors. Annie Potts and Jonathan Price weren't well known ( Price only appears at the end of the movie), but they add to the story. It's an enjoyable film in every way.",1377734400,10,876,4.093023255813954
