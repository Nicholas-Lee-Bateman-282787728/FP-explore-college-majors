1459597,5,B00005JLRT,"Amazingly enough, this film was actually showing at my small-town theater on opening weekend!  Because of my schedule, I wasn't able to see it until Sunday -- by which time the local newspaper reviewers had already given it a thumbs-down.  I decided to go see for myself -- and I'm glad I did.  The film has excellent special effects, and a storyline that gives much to think about concerning the issue of cloning.  I had heard in advance that Data was going to die in this film -- and he does, but not before putting his programming into an earlier prototype called B-4.  There's a strong resemblance to ""STII: The Wrath of Khan"" here, where Spock put his katra (soul-memory) into McCoy's mind before sacrificing himself to save the ship.  At the end of the movie, B-4 shows signs of accessing Data's memory, the same as Spock recognized Jim Kirk at the end of STII.  I sure hope there's going to be a sequel!  And speaking of Spock, it would have been nice to see him make an appearance.  The last time we heard of him (in TNG ""Unification"") he was still working underground to bring Romulans and Vulcans together.  Maybe next movie?  Also, According to an interview with Patrick Steward in TV Guide, there were a lot of great scenes that got cut out of the theater version, which, hopefully, will show up on the DVD edition.",1036368000,,1327,4.533613445378151

1459787,4,B00005JLRT,"Possible spoilers.  A better title for this final chapter in the Next Generation series would have been Clone War but I think Star Wars already owns that one.  The Enterprise under Capt. Picard is sent to the edge of the Neutral Zone that borders the Federations arch enemy, the Romulan Empire.  Scanners are detecting the presence of bionic devices.  It turns out they are various body parts of an android who looks exactly like Data (Brent Spiner) once reassembled.  Known as B-4, he is an early prototype and symbolically, Datas brother.

The Federation leaders then send the Enterprise to Romulus at the request of new leaders who have overthrown the old regime.  It turns out that residents of a Romulan slave planet called Remus, working with Romulan military leaders, have taken over the empire.  Their leader, however is a human called Shinzon (Tom Hardy) who became a slave when he was a boy.  Hes also a clone of Picard, one the captain never knew existed.  Shinzon is dying however.  He not only needs Picards blood but is intent on destroying Earth from which he came.  Hes not fond of Humans because of what they had done to him.

This mission interrupted the honeymoon of Cmdr. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counsellor Troi (Marina Sirtis) who get married in an early scene.  In an interesting change-of-pace sequence, Riker and Troi are getting in on while on the Enterprise.  Meanwhile Shinzon, who was fascinated earlier by his first encounter with a female, has the ability to connect with Troi using the mental capabilities of his Viceroy (Ron Perlman).  She has images of both while in the middle of coitus with her husband.  Try explaining that scene to the kiddies.

Shinzon tantalizes Picard with thoughts of peace between the longtime enemies.  Something Picard would love to have as his legacy.  But can Shinzon be trusted?  This final episode languishes a bit too long in the middle, but still maintains a full supply of warp speed, photon torpedoes and sci-fi gibberish.  A solid conclusion to the series.",1500508800,2,2030,4.874269005847953

1460128,3,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis is the last film related to the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It's also the darkest one. The atmosphere occasionally feels downright Gothic! Captain Jean-Luc Picard discovers that the Romulan Empire has been taken over by a cloned version of himself (sic). The clone, named Shinzon, is leading a slave rebellion of Remans, a bat-like race previously oppressed by the Romulans. An earlier version of the android Data plays a certain role in the plot, as does ship counselor Deanna Troi. Unfortunately, slavery and outcast status hasn't turned the Remans into better men (or bats), with Shinzon himself turning out to be a distilled version of everything that was bad with Picard as a young man. The clone harbors genocidal plans for planet Earth, and the fate of humanity is at stake as Picard and his unnatural twin fight it out in deep space

The first part of Nemesis is relatively good and interesting, but also somewhat unrealistic for those who crave strict in-universe logic (how could the Reman slaves convince the Romulan imperialist fleet to join their uprising?). The second part is more dragging, with the usual cat-and-mouse games inside the equally usual nebula which makes all communication impossible. The main actors are extremely good, so good I almost forgot they *are* actors, and the theme of the film revolves around the question what makes us human, with Data's android brother and Picard's clone as obvious talking points. It's intriguing that the slaves, rather than the imperial Romulan fleet, are the bad guys.

Even so, I prefer First Contact and even Generations to Nemesis due to the dragging second half, but perhaps it looked better on cinema than it does on TV, with all the annoying commercial breaks. Three-and-a-half stars to Star Trek the Goth Generation!",1476403200,,1822,5.029801324503311

1460135,2,B00005JLRT,"The only reason people love this movie is loyalty to the characters -- we love to see this crew do just about anything, and this was our last chance to do just that.  The movie, as a movie, really sucked.  Sorry.  The plot was poor, the character of Shinzon was underdeveloped and overacted (and not in the ""fun Shatner"" kind of way) and the dialog ... whoah boy.  I am also under the firm belief that part of the reason for creating this movie at all was so that Spiner could be rid of Data, once and for all.  And using this movie as a vehicle for that gives plausible deniability to Spiner, who can claim that he loved playing his character as much as anyone, while in reality he was sick to death of him by the time this came out.  My opinion only, but having heard some of his off-hand remarks and reading some of his tweets, I think he's had enough... which is fine, but I look back at this movie now and see such a deliberate act in it.  I can't help but think the whole thing is about Data - look at the story arc:  it begins by Picard explaining the promotion of Data as his new first officer, 2/3 of the way in or so we see the Captain having to take things into his own hands again - just BEGGING to be saved - and who comes along?  Anyway... it was a crap movie.  Sorry folks.  Love the new Enterprise, love this crew, hated the movie.  Just how it goes.",1472947200,4,1366,4.074906367041199

1460223,4,B00005JLRT,"Like many others I was underwhelmed when this movie was first released in 2002. However when I watched it the other day I have grown to appreciate it. The worst part of Nemesis was the timing when it was originally released as it was an unfortunate victim of franchise fatigue and a release date only a few days before Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Otherwise it really is a decent entry in the series which has a good story and by far the best special effects and action sequences of any of the Next Generation films that still look great 14 years later. In contrast, the special effects of First Contact and Insurrection were terrible even for the standards of the day.  The only thing about Nemesis that still bothers me is the fact that Tom Hardy, despite a great performance looked nothing like a young Patrick Stewart. In retrospect they should have had Sir Patrick play both roles. All in all, it is the second best (behind First Contact), of the Next Generation films and it is certainly worthy of the top 5 or 6 of all the Star Trek movies.",1466553600,5,1053,4.427835051546392
1460224,4,B00005JLRT,"It is fitting that a nice round number such as 10 signifies the last adieu of The Next Generation crew.  Picard, #1, Data, Worf, Troi and Dr. Crusher have all new assignments which, unlike many incarnations of Star Trek, allows the crew to finally transfer off the dang ship.  (Coming from a retire sailor, I can tell you, there's no ship in the fleet in which I would have liked to have spent my entire career.)

Romulan Peace or Romulan War?  That is the question.  And just _who_ is the nemesis?  To answer would be to spoil but let's just say, ""It's one of the good(ish) guys.""  The acting in Nemesis is above board.  These actors have had themselves in these uniforms far too long to get sloppy.  The writing is good and the directing by Stuart Baird, a man who knows a thing or two about action movies, keeps this film moving along like clockwork.

It's hardly the best and it certainly isn't the worst of any of the Star Trek films.  This is a good movie and certainly one you'd wish in your collection should be a hard core Trekkie.  That said, if you're not, as someone earlier said, One and Done is enough.  Personally, I'd own it and watch it occasionally but it wouldn't be a ""go-to"" movie.",1464998400,,1202,4.384615384615385

1460346,3,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek Nemesis I thought was a decent movie.  A lot of people were turned off by the darker tone of this film, which had more resemblance of a horror/action movie rather than typical Sci Fi fair.  The previous Star Trek movie Insurrection was kind of boring and just plodded along with not enough action or suspense to keep the film interesting.  So I believe the director of this movie tried to remedy that by overcompensating both of those elements.

The story is kind of average not really on par with First Contact the best movie of the New Generation cast.  Nemesis mainly focuses on the Romulan Empire and a younger villain of Jean Luc Picard.  The movie has some nice elements but you never get the feeling that the Enterprise cast members are in any real danger.  You could see the surprises in the film coming from a mile away taking a lot of the fun out of the film.

I actually kind of enjoy this movie though, even with the darker atmosphere.  I was actually looking forward to the Predator ship Scimitar meeting up with the Federation ships laying in wait to see what they could do against the vessel.  I found it hard to believe the Romulan Warbird captains who wanted to go to war against the Federation would so easily change sides and help the Enterprise and her crew.  Also I felt for all the blasts the Enterprise received I thought it would have shown even more damage all over the ship.  The shields seemed to absorb way to much impact before finally failing.  I was expecting the boards and monitors behind Jean Luc to be showing massive red and orange lighting for receiving maximum damage.  I just did not really buy those scenes along with the end when Jean Luc impales Shinzon and stands motionless for what seems like in a haze when his ship is going to be blown to bits and he wastes precious time in a frozen state until Data brings him back to reality.

Maybe I am being a little to nitpicky but I think the film could have been a lot better overall.  But on the same token I did enjoy this movie.  I was looking forward to at least 1 more film with the Next Generation cast that never was made.  Overall I would rate this film 3  stars.",1458864000,,2170,4.38

1460353,4,B00005JLRT,"Of the ten Trek movies made before the Abrams re-boot, this has always been a favorite of mine.  Great characters...action....wistful sense of finality, and an ending reminiscent of the Wrath of Kahn (another favorite).  In fact if I were to rank the ten movies..it would go something like this:

(1) The Wrath of Kahn.  Just a classic in my mind...great camp (""KAAAAAHHHNNNNN!!!!)
(2) The Voyage Home.  A Trek film like no other.  Great Humor, and Humanity. The movie had great fun with itself, and 80's culture!
(3) The Search for Spock:  It was rather traumatic for me watching the original Enterprise go down.  Now they blow the thing up every other movie, but this ship was like losing a member of the Trek family.
(4) Nemesis: (See Above)
(5) First Contact:  I actually thought that the Next Generation two-part episode ""The Best of Both Worlds"" was better than this movie...with the notable exception of the smokin' Borg Queen.  Generally speaking...some of the best Trek is when the Borg show up.  Definitely the series best villians
(6) The Undiscovered Country: Pretty solid..and a wistful wind down for the classic crew.  Christopher Plummer's Shakespearean Klingon General was a bit much, though...
(7) The Motion Picture:  Long...and quite ponderous.  Took the cerebral aspect of the series to an extreme.  But, if you're an old Trekker like me you remember how exciting it was to see new Trek after a 12 year absence.
(8) Generations: Kind of clunky overall. For a series that did some of its best and most creative work with time travel (see the Next Gen. episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise) they really squandered the Kirk/Picard encounter with this one.
(9) Insurrection: Just bad. The scene near the end when Ricker is driving the Enterprise E with a computer game joy stick is just Lame.
(10) Star Trek V The Final Frontier: I love watching most all Trek. But I just can't watch this one.

Live long...and Prosper!

1460485,3,B00005JLRT,"I've enjoyed Star Trek my whole life, I'm not a fan of the ToS series but I liked some of the movies that came from it, but TNG? Oh man...that series is wonderful, full of rich development of character, plots, twist and all of that is...not present in this movie.

The movie suffers from plot holes and a lack of the essence of what makes something Star Trek. It starts out like it could be like that but after that it's silly action (a star trek land buggy? that deploys from a shuttle? WOT). The plot really suffers from trying to be like Wrath of Khan while taking notes from the episodes featuring Data's brother, Lore. But this movie's ONE redeeming quality is .....it has a really, really cool lengthy space battle.

I know, I know that's not what Star Trek is about and I entirely agree, it should be about exploration, meaningful conflict, but I cannot deny the whole space battle part being really entertaining to a sci-fi nerd such as me. Honestly I would have ...

-spoilers-
I would have given the movie more points if there was some redemtion from Shinzon, maybe he realized what he was doing and Picards words echoed with him, instead he's cartoon-ishly evil and must destroy Earth. It's so dumb that Earth has always been a focus with the Star Trek movies, I get that it's a big pivotal planet but there's plenty of those I'm sure and the series is about SPACE not this planet that we're all nailed to.....but I digress.
B4 being an evil pawn was not a great plot point, there's so many holes in that- not limited to Data downloading ALL of his info into B4 being a major security risk but ...whatever. The Enterprise being blindsided was also incredibly stupid since it was painfully obvious there would have been a problem before it happened and Picard, yet again being an action hero at the end doesn't work, Worf should have been sent over, ANYONE else should have been sent over.
-end spoilers-

Again I like this movie for the really well made space battle and that I admit is a shallow reason to enjoy it but I'd rather find something fun to like in a movie than dismiss the entire thing. TNG as a series exists still for wonderful plot and stories, this exists as a fun space battle I like to throw on when I need some silly action.",1437868800,,2255,4.4396135265700485

1460801,1,B00005JLRT,"This was the worst Star Trek movie of all time, hands-down. Killing Data was basically a giant ""screw you"" to the loyal fans who grew-up loving that immortal android. The justification they gave was that he was starting to look too old to pull it off, even with make-up. But seeing as how this was going to be the last TNG movie, anyway, and they replaced Data with a ""less perfect"" android (series reference I snuck in there) who didn't die and was played by the same aging actor, that argument was moot. Rumor has it that Brent Spiner had wanted his character to die since Insurrection, but that doesn't mean they had to do it. While I love the actors, the characters they played belong to all of us, not just the people playing them.

Also, the reason for his death in the context of the plot also made no sense. In the movie, he stays behind so he can destroy the ship using his hand phaser. But here's the thing: We've seen, on several occasions, that the phasers can be quickly and easily configured to fire autonomously; i.e. you push a few buttons, set the phaser down on a level surface, and run like hell. Data could've done that and beamed-out with Picard. And he would have, if the writing of Data's character had had any resemblence to that of the previous movies and series.

Interestingly, the few good scenes in the movie were all edited out before release. Picard's conversation with Wesley Crusher at the wedding, for example, where we learn that he rejoined Starfleet and will be serving as assistant chief engineer on Riker's new ship, was awesome. Or the scene near the end in which Riker tricks Picard's new first officer (played by the same actor who played Major Hayes on Enterprise; his decendent, perhaps?) into calling him ""Jean-Luc"" (the captain was not amused).

Personally, as a fan who saw this movie once and swore never to again, I decided that all these nonsensical events of the movie were the result of all those temporal incursions that have been going around; a weird, edge-case timeline where all kinds of stuff happens that makes no sense. Data isn't dead; he just died in that alternate timeline where Picard had a creepy Romulan clone who wanted to destroy Earth for no reason, Starfleet vessels are equipped with Jeeps, and Dr. Soong had a secret love of lame-ass puns. That little mental trick enables me to pretend that the events of the movie never happened-- in the context of the fictional Star Trek universe, of course. I'm not that crazy. =)",1423958400,,2491,4.618510158013544
1460802,5,B00005JLRT,"I thought it was a great movie, one of my Next Generation movies.",1421107200,,65,4.076923076923077
1460803,2,B00005JLRT,"Come December 2002, Paramount Pictures and series producer Rick Berman had four long years, between the lackluster ""Star Trek Insurrection"" and far too many TV series spin-offs, to surely recognize that Trek had maxed out from overexposure.  In a seemingly desperate gambit to regenerate The Next Generation for its 15th anniversary, Berman rolled the dice on two franchise newbies: screenwriter John Logan and editor-director Stuart Baird, to either save a sinking Enterprise or gracefully conclude the Captain Picard era.  Unfortunately, neither intergalactic mission was accomplished.

Many reviewers have said ""Star Trek Nemesis"" deliberately tries to imitate ""STII: The Wrath of Khan.""  Yes, the loss of a major character at the story's end is reminiscent, but I don't really see any further comparison.  Simply put, ""Nemesis"" isn't even in the same orbit as the far superior ""Khan.""  If anything, ""Nemesis"" is really the Next Generation's ""Undiscovered Country,"" with one BIG difference.  By conjuring up one last round of Trek magic, at least 1991's ""STVI: The Undiscovered Country"" made it look like that the elderly yet charismatic, original cast still wanted to keep going.  In contrast, the middle-aged Next Generation gang appears bored stiff and resigned in ""Nemesis,"" as if wisely sensing the franchise's imminent doom.  This fourth Next Generation film's poor box office haul was surely no accident, as was Paramount's decision to wait seven years to reboot Trek.

Further, if George Lucas hadn't already been trolling the clone concept in his equally tedious Star Wars prequels, the intriguing premise of skewed mirror images might have actually worked.  The added hook of a major-scale Romulan insurrection threatening the Federation could have been a touch of genius.  Instead, due to a dispirited cast and far too many recycled plot gimmicks, ""Nemesis"" quickly grows tiresome.  Case in point: how many times in the TV series did Data already face a clone (i.e. Lore)?  Or how many times was Counselor Troi psychically assaulted by a villain?  Or how many Next Generation films films revolve exclusively around Picard and Data?  As a result, how often were LaForge, Crusher, Worf, Troi, and even Riker inexplicably short-changed?  Ultimately, such statistics don't matter, as all these clichs gratuitously occur once again in this tenth Trek film.  Beyond the long-overdue Riker-Troi marriage, ""Nemesis"" fails to offer anything truly worth waiting for.

To jettison the Next Generation's lethargic image, the film's new creative team forcibly attempts to transform Picard, Data, Worf, and Riker into action heroes (i.e. the dune buggy shoot-out chase sequence; Riker's Kirk-like fistfight, etc.).  Similar ideas worked in 1996's ""Star Trek First Contact"" because the script smartly copied an ""Aliens""-like, shoot-em-up formula vs. the Borg.  This time, neither the actors nor their characters are plausible in ""Star Wars""-like battle scenes.  When one recalls The Next Generation's 1987-1994 TV run, flashy stunts were seldom seen because talk superseded action distancing the series from the colorful Captain Kirk era.  To Berman's credit, despite his cast's minimal charisma, the Next Generation TV series succeeded on its own merits without resorting to cheap violence.  Once The Next Generation graduated to big-screen features, however, the substantial pressure to provide slam-bang thrills for mass audiences was all too obvious.  Unsurprisingly, ""Nemesis"" ineptly tries to substitute Picard & Data into a Kirk & Spock-like epic adventure that fails on most thrusters.

It is fair to say, though, that the film provides some closure by sending off newlyweds (and newly promoted) Captain Riker and Counselor Troi to the U.S.S. Titan (i.e. another potential spin-off franchise).  It is also conveyed that LaForge and Crusher are also moving on.  Beyond a mildly amusing wedding reception gag, Worf's role is really an extended cameo, much like LaForge's and Dr. Crusher's.  Credited as a co-writer, Brent Spiner's Data predictably gets plenty of screen time, and, much like ""Khan,"" there is a wink-wink hint that his future with The Next Generation was still possible.  That leaves Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard, as he has a worthy antagonist in Shinzon (Tom Hardy), his chilling, half-Romulan (but much younger) clone.  Stewart's efforts are adequate this time, if not simply routine.  Perhaps Stewart would have been content forging ahead, but the disappointing ""Nemesis"" confirms the Picard era was already long past its prime.

Despite this movie's weaknesses, the DVD/blu-ray extras are a treasure trove.  With the trailers, documentaries, etc., Trek certainly gives its fans their money's worth re: bonus features.  The deleted scenes may prove somewhat insightful, as it is telling that director Baird edited the film per his own judgment vs. leaving in what many Trek fans actually wanted to see.  Still, no amount of faster-pace editing can disguise the dismal, sluggish ambiance permeating ""Nemesis;"" the awkward efforts to create some ""Star Wars""-style excitement, and the cast's evident lack of enthusiasm.  In conclusion, if producer Berman had truly wanted his own ""Wrath of Khan"" or even an ""Undiscovered Country,"" then perhaps he should have instead hired their screenwriter/director, Nicholas Meyer.

Rating: 2 /5 stars (Besides the sci-fi violence, the two ""psychic assault"" scenes are inappropriate for younger viewers).",1420761600,3,5464,5.49940119760479

I found this film was quite well executed in a technical sense, and also many aspects of the movie were surprisingly good (such as the effects around the radiogenic weapon used by the rogue Romulans and the final space battle between the Enterprise and Scimitar).  Unfortunately the plot falls somewhat flat and is undermined by a degree of confusion and incoherence (Picard has a clone? - Why only is he revealed now?), worn out storyline clichs from earlier films, and a sense of weariness among the TNG crew (wonderfully parodied in 'Galaxy Quest').  Trek seemed to run out of steam by the third instalment and the end of Voyager and DS9 with nothing better to replace it and the sense is palpable in this film.

The introduction of the Remans is poorly handled (they seem like cartoonish caricatures of 1930's era movie Vampires with black clothing, pointed ears and sharp teeth) and the potential to get a good story out of the relatively shadowy Romulans is wasted on a miscast villain in the form of 'Shinzon', a human clone.  Despite the sinister Remans and powerful flagship 'Scimitar', Shinzon wouldn't even scare Big Bird or Smokey the Bear.  Not even the sacrifice of Data at the end of the film to save his shipmates can salvage this one.

The movie is saved from being a flop by good acting in parts, decent action sequences (especially the final battle) and decent special effects.  Unfortunately not much else can be said in this film's favour.

Not a good send off for the otherwise excellent TNG franchise.",1411430400,,1740,4.808724832214765

You can almost see the mindset of putting an idea into the story just because the writer thought it was cool whether it fit the rest of the story or not.  This is what happens when you let yourself get talked into making a movie based on a script from an amateur.

For what it's worth, I've been a fan of all things Trek most of my life, and this one ranks right down there with Star Trek V The Final Frontier.  It's too bad the otherwise excellent legacy of the Next Gen cast wrapped up this way.",1407888000,,659,4.248

1461220,1,B00005JLRT,"It's difficult to know where to begin with listing the problems for this film. In general, I feel like many of the STNG films are compromises in an attempt to reach a wider audience and often betray the heart of the TV series by focusing more on action than the more thoughtful and philosophical aspects that I came to love about TNG. That said, all of the previous films had at least some redeeming qualities. I rather enjoyed Generations and First Contact and Insurrection wasn't too bad. Nemesis, however, was just terrible. The only part of it I enjoyed was Riker and Troi's wedding. Everything after that was downhill. The plot, concerning a clone of captain Picard and a ""clone"" of Data was illogical. The motivation of Picard's evil doppelganger was muddled and he did not come off as a convincing clone of Picard. (I also found it quite funny that they needed to make the clone bald so that he would look like Picard. Younger versions of Picard in the series had hair.)

****SPOILER ALERT***
The worst part of this film was the death of one of the major characters, namely, Data. Star Trek was always something of a feel-good show. I used to watch it with my grandmother when I was young and now I watch it with my son. I tend to gravitate toward re-watching TNG when I feel depressed about the state of the world and hopeless about the future. All the violence and darkness in the films, and especially in Nemesis, feels like a betrayal of the hope Star Trek used to hold for me. But a worse betrayal was the death of Data. With this being the last of the TNG movies I think the fans really wanted to see their beloved characters ride off into the sunset. Data's death made no sense and seemed like it took place in a situation that could have been avoided with a bit more finesse on the part of the writers. It felt like they were pushing for a tragic, heroic moment to end the series, but they couldn't be bothered to develop it in a meaningful and logical fashion. My son was quite distraught that his favorite character had died and both of us regretted wasting nearly two hours of our lives watching this dreadful film.

 I really wish this film could be stricken from the Star Trek canon. IN my memory of the series I will certainly treat it as such. Man episodes of the show (and especially the series finale) were of much higher quality than any of the TNG films. If you loved STNG I strongly suggest that you do not watch Nemesis (or watch it for the Riker-Troi wedding and then turn it off.)",1403481600,3,2510,4.428571428571429

1461222,4,B00005JLRT,"I'm always amused by the self-proclaimed Trek experts. They nit pick every detail of each of the TV series following the original. They treat the movies the same, searching for some kind of absolute continuity that no science fiction fan would ever ask of H.G. Wells, much less Ovid. I know this because I saw every episode of the original when first broadcast back in the 60s as well as the TV series that came after, and all the movies more than once. Without fail, the self-proclaimed Trek people have done the same thing decade after decade. I wonder if they are disappointed that James Joyce did not fill in the blanks between Dubliners and Finnegan's Wake. In any case, Nemesis is a very good Trek movie, well worth watching. It has the classical attributes of Trek, creativity, individuality, humor, good special effects, intelligence, the desire to understand the unknown, compassion, etc. I bet you'll like it.",1401148800,,919,4.859872611464968

Frankly, if that's seen as a flaw, I'm not bothered by it in the least, since this is by far the best Star Trek movie I've ever seen -- and I've seen just about all of them.  I've been a Star Trek fan since the first TV series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.  This one does look like the swan song for Next Generation, but a spectacular end it was.  After the first scene with the Romulans the movie started tamely enough, and I was afraid it was going to be somewhat campy, but the tension slowly built, with few gratuitous action scenes, as all the real action seemed focus toward the final climax, an epic battle between two powerful starships.  This one is completely unpredictable, and will have you on the edge of your seat until the end.  The acting was very capable and the special effects were superb.

Riker and Troi are getting married.  Wil Wheaton is there so briefly that if you blink you'll miss him.  Worf is on board with no explanation as to why he's not on DS9.  Janeway makes a brief appearance as an admiral.

Overall the plot has a lot of stretching.  A human clone of Picard that (somehow) the Romulans made and then (for some reason) they didn't feel like using gets booted to the mines on Remus.  Then he gains the loyalty of the Remens as a whole who somehow build a dreadnaught cruiser without any Romulans, masters of subterfuge, none the wiser.  Said ship can fire cloaked, something no other cloaked ship (except for ST:VI) could do.  Many of these plot holes are never explained.

The Romulan government has undergone a coup, and now power resides in the hands of a young human with ties to Picard. Can Picard uncover his nemesis' true motives before it's too late? And how does the discovery of a Data-like android play into things? The end result is a bland mix that would have played well on TV but just doesn't muster up much enthusiasm on the big screen.

1461694,3,B00005JLRT,"I like this film a lot; I really wanted to love it.  I've said a million times and I'll say it again; Star Trek works best on TV.  The best Star Trek stories - the ones that deal with social and moral issues - have been TV episodes.  The films obviously have to do a bigger job of selling to millions of people who may or may not be diehard Trekkies.  Billed as ""A Generation's Final Journey"" (obviously the final film for the cast of The Next Generation, Star Trek: Nemesis tried hard to be that.  In some ways it succeeded, it others it failed.

Where ""Nemesis"" whole-heartedly succeeds is the farewell of Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and the introduction of the beloved android's dysfunctional prototype ""brother,"" B4.  As with the character of android Lore, Data's more sophisticated sibling from TNG, Brent Spiner plays the new character with perfection.  The film's other big success is the relationship between Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his foil, Reman-raised human Shinzon, who becomes Praetor of the Romulan empire after a successful Reman coup.  Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy play those scenes brilliantly, a tribute to both actors.  Captain Picard comes face to face with what his life could have been like under different circumstances, and the conclusion of that storyline is a heroic and tragic sacrifice, the most ""human"" sacrifice of all.  Finally, the relationship between Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes)and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) comes full circle.  The film includes the wedding of Riker and Troi, which includes the return of characters Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), but takes a dark turn during the film's overall mission that includes telepathic rape.  The ""funeral"" for Data was also very touching.  Three of the main characters - Riker and Troi, and Crusher - depart the Enterprise at the conclusion of the film; more on that in a minute.

For the era (circa 2002) and the relatively small budget, the special effects in Nemesis are great.  The space battle between the Enterprise and the Scimitar is awesome.  I enjoyed the scenes on Romulus with the Romulan Senate, as well as the Romulan characters and their relationship to their once Reman slaves.  Speaking of the Remans, this was a very enjoyable introduction.  There is a scene in the Enterprise conference lounge that acknowledges the Federation has been aware of the Remans for some time, despite their first appearance in this film.

While ""Nemesis"" succeeds on several levels, it also fails on several more.  First, too much of the film was cut.  We know from the wedding scene that Commander Riker has been command of a new starship, the Nova Class Starship Titan, and that his new bride, Counselor Troi, is accompanying him.  What you don't see in the film - and you won't know if you don't watch the deleted scenes or know anything about the Star Trek universe - is that Dr. Beverly Crusher is also leaving the Enterprise to once again helm Starfleet Medical.  While this departure is short-lived (in the succeeding original Star Trek novels she returns to the Enterprise and subsequently marries Picard), I always wondered why her goodbye scene with Picard is never shown.  Also, other than a few scenes in sickbay and one very ""clinical"" private scene with Picard, Crusher is once again given NOTHING to do.  Gates McFadden is a great actress and Beverly Crusher and Captain Picard have a rich history; since this film was billed as ""a generation's final journey"" the writers and the director failed big time here.  This was the perfect opportunity to finally bring these characters together.  Next, LeVar Burton's character Geordi La Forge is also shafted.  He has a few scenes with Data - he was lucky enough to get more scenes than Crusher - but Geordi was Data's best friend.  Other than acknowledging Data's cat Spot had chosen Worf as its new master, Geordi was not properly allowed to say goodbye to Data.  Finally, WHY is Worf still the security chief of the Enterprise?  He came back after ""Insurrection"" as the security chief (in ""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection"" his character was ""on loan"" as ""Deep Space Nine"" was still on the air), but why?  He was the strategic operations officer on DS9, and the Federation ambassador to the Klingon home world. Isn't going back to being the Security Chief on a starship a career step backwards?

Yes I realize my gripes do not really detract from the overall story - unless you are a diehard Trekkie.  This film had the potential to be amazing, instead it was just a ""good film.""",1379894400,,4583,4.892487046632124

1461756,5,B00005JLRT,"I have the Blu-ray of this film, but also have purchased the original DVD release and the Special Edition DVD releases in the past.  The video quality is an upgrade beyond the HD mastering.  There's less evidence of artifacting, better color saturation, and more fluidity in the action sequences (this is largely due to the 24fps nature of Blu-ray and a television that can exploit that).  The sound quality is equally impressive.

Okay, so now to the film.  It's often said that this film ""killed"" the old Star Trek film franchise.  The same is said on TV for Enterprise.  Both are lies.  I won't delve into Enterprise here, but something must be said about Nemesis here.

Paramount really bungled the release of this film.

Much is made about the box office and I think the failure there and the seven year gap between this film and the reboot (Star Trek - 2009) have caused fans to reflexively view it in a negative light; a far more negative light than it deserves.  The marketing on the film was poor, indicating that Paramount gave up on it.  Yet I think the lead reason they gave up was due to its poor location in the release schedule.  While Harry Potter had been in theaters for a month, Paramount put out Nemesis less than a week before The Two Towers was to be released.  The Christmas season is a busy time and Star Trek films often get lost in the shuffle during those busy seasons.

So Nemesis became a box office disaster, falling far below First Contact and falling short of the tepid box office of Insurrection as well.  Someone must be blamed and the Paramount execs likely didn't want the finger pointed at them.  That's not to say that Berman hadn't made mistakes - I'm no Berman apologist.

Yet there's a lot of silly nitpicking with this movie that other Star Trek films don't receive.  Why haven't we heard about the Remans before?  Hmmm, maybe we don't know everything about an enemy that the Federation barely knows!  Why is Worf on the ship?  It seems he was attending a wedding and hadn't resigned his Starfleet commission (maybe they were all together for a nostalgic last cruise together before Riker took over the Titan?).  Most of the nitpicks can be easily explained.  They are not flaws in the script or plotholes because they are easily explained.  I find it funny that many complain that movies are unintelligent but then complain when a screenwriter, director, or producer believes that a viewer can figure things out for themselves.  Do you want your hand held or not?  You can't have it both ways.

Are there contrived points in the plot?  Sure!  Seeing as the script must be fabricated, the whole film is technically contrived.  All films are contrived.  All films also have a lot of ""convenient"" moments since the story doesn't just naturally flow out of interaction, but actually is forced by the writer or writers.

I guess the complaints of the plot being Picard centric could be somewhat valid, but how often has this truly been an ensemble cast?  First Contact was pretty Picard centric, but he is the Captain, after all.  The Next Generation cast never functioned like The Original Series cast where three characters emerged.  All the series that followed Kirk, Spock, and McCoy gave us a strong captain (or commander initially in DS9) and a good supporting cast below.  So should we be surprised that the Next Gen movies focused mostly on Picard?  Data was really the secondary character and he also received much focus in the films, as he does in Nemesis.  The brilliant aspect of Nemesis is that it uses Data and Picard's stories in parallel, juxtaposing them.

True, every detail is not examined.  We hear nothing of Lore, but why do we need to?  He's disassembled and accounted for.  Why confuse a potential audience unfamiliar with every single TNG episode?

But a pattern emerges; one of choice and change.  The villain, Shinzon, refuses to believe he can change who he is.  Picard believes the opposite and a futuristic Arthurian tale is shown on the screen.

Even the ""contrived"" features of Nemesis are quite good.  The ""dune buggy"" scene is often despised.  I love it.  Why?  It shows that people like Picard in the 24th century aren't all snooty all the time.  Humanity still likes to have fun.  It's not all sanitized starships and bland technobabble - a high speed open air romp still has its place.

Nemesis does reach into the old ""your the closest ship"" problem Star Trek has, but it handles it brilliantly with that dune buggy chase.  Not to give too much away, but it seems the Romulans know the Federation likes to send the closest available ship so they lured the Enterprise close to the Neutral Zone and then called Starfleet and asked for a meeting.  I found that to be a smart workaround.

So the film has story.  It has emotional resonance (the main emotional point is really high but I won't delve into it, other than to say it is the most significant sacrifice in Star Trek history).  It allows the viewer to contemplate his or her own nature and choices.  It has some good action sequences (and remember that Star Trek didn't have big budgets prior to the 2009 reboot, so the action scenes were not as extensive as they'd have liked).  In many ways, I find it better than First Contact.  I do think it could be improved by adding back in scenes left of the cutting room floor, but it moves quickly as it is.  It explains everything or lays enough out for the viewer to think it through.

We know Picard goes on.  We know Riker gets his own command, yet The Next Generation as we knew it ended at Nemesis.  They may not have gotten to sign their names like the original crew did, but this was a good ending.  It closed a story (kinda) and gave us a hope for the future.  The crew didn't just go into mothballs.  They lived.

So open your mind, throw out your preconceptions or past biases.  Look at Nemesis with the freshest eyes you can manage.  You may be surprised to find a fine film that is not perfect, but that is worthy of your attention.",1375660800,2,6020,4.591165413533835

I just recently finished watching the entire TNG series. I then followed with the movies but I was hesitant to watch this because the previous 3 movies had let me down and I was worried that the last one with TNG cast would do the same. Unfortunately, it did.
Most of the reviews here touch on all the things I found wrong with the movie. When coming up to the Data-like body parts, how nobody mentioned Lore did seem like a big oversight. With the time-travel they've experienced in the series, was it not even a consideration that it might be him?
Was this the Data-Picard show? This was the last movie and I certainly expected more than just a few lines of dialog from a lot of the main characters of TNG.
I was very disappointed that they were trying to make it seem like because there was a clone, the clone should think like the original person and they could predict what each other would do. Really? That far into the future and they haven't figured out that environmental factors are a big deal and no two individuals (cloned or not) will ever turn out the same?
There were some good parts to the movie, but not enough to really satisfy me. The one part that I thought was very emotional was Data sacrificing himself to save Picard. Data was my favorite character of the series, and to see him do that was definitely a sobering moment. However, it was semi-disappointing that B-4 started to act like Data at the end, as if he would be replaced that easily.
For a non-Trek fan, I could see this movie being enjoyable. But for someone who fell in love with the series, I was expecting a lot more from the last adventure of TNG crew.",1368403200,,1656,4.394136807817589

1461915,4,B00005JLRT,"So many people inexplicably love to hate ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002), but it's actually a solid Trek film featuring the Next Generation cast.

The lengthy space battle in the final act is second to none in the Star Trek franchise. But that's not the main reason I like it.

I like the whole exploration of the conflict of flesh (Shinzon) and spirit (Picard) and the debate over nature (Picard) vs. nurture (Shinzon), or is it nature (Shinzon) vs. nurture (Picard)? Like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VII-Generations/dp/B000JINWNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VII: Generations</a>"", it entertains while delving into deeper themes, although ""Generations"" is better (a near masterpiece, in fact; see my review for details).

Data's course of action at the end is way more compelling and moving than a similar scene in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/B000HZD168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a>"". Think about it, Data becomes the Christ figure by making the ultimate gesture of love and loyalty; an android, no less.

Speaking of TWOK, ""Nemesis"" is often said to be a quasi-remake of that film, but it's not. It shares some plot elements of the trilogy (TWOK, TSFS and TVH), but that's it (the space stand-off, Data's sacrifice and the ""resurrection"" of a blank-version of himself). It's an homage, not a remake, and better than the overrated TWOK.

I don't think NEMESIS ranks with the greatest of Trek films -- like TMP, TSFS, TVH and Generations -- but it's certainly a solid Trek movie, along the lines of TUC.

Concerning the incredible ire the dunebuggy sequence has provoked, I'm at a loss. The landing party had to cover a lot of terrain, how else would they do it without something to travel in? Why walk miles on end when you don't have to? Besides, it's a fun scene and gives the austere proceedings a much-needed jolt at that particular point.

Be sure to check out the deleted scenes; there are a couple that shouldn't have been cut, like the one involving Riker's joke on Picard's new First Officer and an amusing one involving Picard and Data having a discussion over wine.

Anyway, those who keep shoveling hate on ""Nemesis"" are full of you know what.

It's about exploring other worlds and using ones brain rather than brawn. Finally, being that this film came out in 2002, it's a CGI extravaganza, which for the most part is embraced.

1461990,2,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek Nemesis is a strange film. We have a fresh perspective from new writers and a new director and with a focus on Romulans for a change. It's a recipe to refresh the Star Trek movie franchise. What we end up with is a movie that pays little to no attention to established canon and gives us a story that is duller than the worst episodes of any Trek series. Sadly, it killed off the original series of movies that started back with the first film.

Let me get the good out of the way. This movie often looks good and the space battle is the best since Wrath of Khan. From there, the movie does everything wrong.

How do I list the things wrong with the film? First of all, if you are a fan, a true fan, the continuity issues will drive you crazy. Why is Wesley at the wedding? Isn't he with the Traveler? (and why no lines for him). Then Mr. Worf. OK, he can been invited to the wedding. That's fine. But why is he part of the crew? Isn't he ambassador to the Klingon Homeworld? Then we have the case of B-4. Absolutely no mention of Lore. Why??? He caused them plenty of problems in the past. And how would Shinzon find B-4? I just don't buy the concept of B4 except to help with the ending of the film.

Next up, the characters. They do not look like they are having any real fun. The jokes are ALL forced (Mr. Data? Shut Up...Irving Berlin...Very astute...etc.) and not funny in the least. Even the fun loving Jonathan Frakes seemed almost bored. Spinners B-4 seemed weak and even when he was trying to be funny as Data, it just seemed very bland. Poor Gates McFadden...she barely got any screen time and if she did, it had no character relevance at all. And with all do respect to Marina Sirtis, when Shinzon talked about her being beautiful and such, she looked nothing of the sort. Granted, it may have been the lighting, makeup, hairstyle, but I didn't buy it.

Finally, the story was rather bland. A clone of Picard left to die on a mining planet and has years of bitterness built up and he is mad. Mind you, some of the duality questions with him and Picard were somewhat interesting but this is not a movie plot, especially if you want to try to bring in new fans. (SPOILER) We end the movie on the note of Data dying to save Picard. This had no emotional resonance, especially in the very awkward and short memorial scene. This scene should have packed more emotion and it just sat there. Oh, we remember Pop Goes The Weasel! Great, let's move on. Come on! That scene needed to be more. And finally, we are left with a sort of but not really an ending for The Next Generation. This cast and crew deserves a better send off for sure.

Nemesis has the look and feel of a successful movie but you peal away the layers of problems, you are left with next to nothing.",1362614400,2,2780,4.267552182163188

- as reviewer _Lee Neville_ said ""There is definitely a sense of goodbye with this film"" Sad i Know.. but they had to end it somewhere.

- finally a wedding for two main characters(if you know TNG you know who)

-guest star admiral ( i liked the show but promoted before Picard really :( )

1462405,3,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek Nemesis(2002) was a critical and commercial flop at the time. The TV show Star Trek Enterprise was cancelled years later. At the time, the Star Trek franchise was ""running out of gas"". Even I thought Star Trek Nemesis was disappointing at the time. Star Trek Nemesis is a decent film. It has state of the art visual effects, a good music score by the late Jerry Goldsmith, good action scenes and some good acting. The film does suffer from a flawed script and corny dialouge. It retcons facts established in the TV show Star Trek The Next Generation(1987-1994). The crew of the USS Enterprise has to stop Shinzon(Tom Hardy) from destroying Earth with a diabolical weapon. Shinzon is a clone of Captain Jean Luc Picard(Patrick Stewart) created by Romulans. Shinzon was raised by Remans, a warrior class that Romulans find inferior.
 Stuart Baird does a decent job directing Star Trek Nemesis even though he knew little about the Star Trek franchise. Bryan Singer, Wil Wheaton, Whoopi Goldberg and Kate Mulgrew make brief cameos in the film. Over 50 minutes of footage was cut out to speed up the pacing of the movie. The tone of the movie is very dark. Deanna Troi(Marina Sirtis) is ""violated"" by Shinzon and people are maimed and killed in fairly gruesome ways. This film has the guts to sacrifice one of our beloved characters! Ron Perlman is quite good as Shinzon's Reman viceroy. The Reman make up is an homage to Nosferatu. Dina Meyer is good as a Romulan woman. The plot for Star Trek Nemesis is an homage/rehash of Star Trek The Wrath of Khan(1982). The scene where the Remans invade the Enterprise is similar to the scene where the Klingons invade the Enterprise in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock(1984). There's been a giant trend of rebooting franchises in the past 8 or 9 years. Star Trek was rebooted in a big budget 2009 film directed by J.J. Abrams.

I think that the movie stands alone well. The questions that I did have were more plot specific. If I wrote them out here though, it would be a spoiler, so I will refrain.

If you are a Tom Hardy fan, then I say watch the movie! There is a scene where his character asks to touch a woman's hair, forgetting where he was for a moment. I really liked the expressions Tom used for the character in that part. Tom Hardy plays duality so well, and this film is another example of that.

1462409,4,B00005JLRT,"Along with the perceived failure of the Star Trek: Enterprise television series, Star Trek: Nemesis was widely blamed for the apparent ""end"" of Star Trek as a franchise when it was released in 2002 to subpar box office sales and mediocre reviews.  However, it is a curious movie in many respects, and much better than its reputation would suggest.

First, a quick trivia question, the answer to which may surprise you.  The planet Earth is threatened by a menacing Romulan battleship that is stronger than the Enterprise (or any other Earth/Federation vessel), and which has the ability to destroy all life on the planet.  It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to defeat this threat.  What movie is this?

Of course, this is J.J. Abrams' epic 2009 reboot/sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Two-Disc-Digital-Copy-Edition/dp/B001AVCFJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)</a>, right?  Well, yes.....and it's also Star Trek: Nemesis.  (The battleship in ""Nemesis"" is actually a Reman vessel, but that's a technicality.)

The big advantage that Abrams' movie had over its 2002 predecessor is that it was a reboot and a Kirk-Spock origin story, which offered Star Trek neophytes the chance to go into the movie without feeling intimidated by the extensive Trek backstory, and naturally brought fans back after four years of no Star Trek on television or movie screens.

To the new Star Trek fans that Abrams' excellent film created, and to the older fans that never saw ""Nemesis"" because of its notorious reputation, I say: give it a chance.  It is not a perfect film, but it's a good film with a lot of things going for it.  The following is a brief synopsis of the film's plot (I will avoid major spoilers whenever possible): after years of simmering hostility, the Romulan Empire and its new leader, Shinzon (played by Tom Hardy, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception-Two-Disc-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B002ZG981E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception (Two-Disc Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] and the upcoming Batman movie), have offered to open peace negotiations with the Federation.  Starfleet dispatches the U.S.S. Enterprise under the command of Jean-Luc Picard (played superbly once again by the incomparable Patrick Stewart).  On its way to Romulus to begin negotiations, the crew makes a mysterious discovery: a replica android (named B-4) of Commander Data (Brent Spiner).  Even more mysterious, Picard discovers that Shinzon is a younger clone of himself.  Predictably, the ostensible peace offering reveals itself to be a trip laid by Shinzon to capture Picard and he reveals his true intentions: to destroy Earth using his vessel- the Scimitar (essentially a battleship that doubles as a WMD that can destroy all life on a planet).

The script, written by John Logan (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;fame), offers a good storyline with the underlying theme of duality, as illustrated by B-4 and Data, and Picard and his younger evil doppelganger Shinzon.  As with many good Trek stories, it challenges the viewer to ask himself/herself an important moral question: in this case, what makes you the person you are (and in turn, could certain events make a person otherwise destined to be good not good at all?)?

Some have criticized the film because of its similarities to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan-The-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>, a film considered by many fans (myself included) to be the best of all the Trek films.  Admittedly, there are many similarities: a personal connection between the hero and the villain (Kirk-Khan vs. Picard-Shinzon), a potential WMD being wielded by the villain (the Genesis Device vs. the Scimitar), a space battle in a nebula, and a sacrifice by a major character to save the Enterprise (more on this later).  However, it must be said that after 45 years of television shows and movies, it is virtually impossible for any Trek writer to avoid at least partial similarities to a previous movie or television episode.  So, I do not begrudge the fact that screenwriter Logan decided to make several nods to a classic Trek movie.

In addition to this intriguing storyline, the movie features excellent visual effects, a masterful score by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith, and solid acting all around (especially by Stewart, Spiner, and Hardy).  So where does the movie lose some points?  I will explain:

1.  *An unnecessary death of a major character* To avoid spoilers, I will not mention the major character who dies in the movie.  However, it is clear that screenwriter Logan was going after the emotional impact of Spock's death in Star Trek II.  The sacrifice of the character in Nemesis is not handled as expertly as Spock's sacrifice, however.  Also, it must be said that the handwriting was clearly on the wall when this movie was being made in 2001-2002 that this was to be the last movie featuring the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" crew, making the killing off of an important character unnecessary.  Director Nicholas Meyer and the writers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VI-The-Undiscovered-Country-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;wisely avoided this sort of tempting but gratuitous attempt at emotional poignancy with the send-off for the original cast in that movie.

2.  *A slightly disappointing climax*  (Minor spoilers) The climax of the movie is an exciting space battle between the Enterprise and the Scimitar in a nebula.  Clearly overmatched, the Enterprise briefly turns the tables on its adversary thanks to a surprising tactic undertaken by Counselor Troi (an underused character played well by Marina Sirtis).  With the viewer now emotionally invested in seeing the Enterprise stick it to Shinzon and the Scimitar, Screenwriter Logan then inexplicably has the Scimitar disable the Enterprise, so that Picard is forced to ram his ship into the Scimitar.

Logan had stated that he always wanted to see the Enterprise ram another ship, and while director Stuart Baird films the scene in an effective manner, it comes across as slightly gratuitous and unnecessary (not unlike the ill-advised, pointless ""crashing of the Enterprise"" sequence written by Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Generations-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002HDOB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek - Generations (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>).  Logan here makes the mistake that unfortunately many Trek writers make, in failing to understand that the Enterprise is a character too, and the viewer is invested in seeing this character succeed.  Thus, this scene would have been better written if the Enterprise clearly defeated the Scimitar in combat.  This would have in no way rendered impossible the final showdown between Picard and Shinzon on the Scimitar Bridge that unfolded in the movie.

3.  *Shinzon's motivation for wanting to destroy Earth is never fully or adequately explained*  To go back to J.J. Abrams' movie for a moment, the Romulan villain Nero (played by Eric Bana) decides that he will destroy Earth and the planet Vulcan out of revenge because the Federation- in his mind- did not help save his planet from destruction.  Nero's motivations- while evil, misguided, and misinformed- were understandable.

By contrast, Shinzon's motivations for wanting to destroy Earth are never explained satisfactorily.  The only explanation we are given is by Picard in the lead-up to the final battle.  When asked why he believes Shinzon will go after Earth, he answers: ""I know how he thinks.""  Huh?  If anything, Shinzon, after being enslaved his whole life by Romulans, should want to destroy Romulus.  The fact that he decides inexplicably that he must destroy all life on a planet that has done nothing to him is a huge leap of logic that the movie does not quite pull off, and the climax ultimately suffers for it.

In summary, Star Trek: Nemesis is a good movie, and is not the disastrous train wreck that some Trek fans have made it out to be.  Ultimately, I think the movie failed at the box office because of its release date.  Paramount decided to release the movie in December 2002, when it would be up against Harry Potter, James Bond, and Lord of the Rings.  It should have come as no shock that Nemesis got lost in the shuffle.  Had it been released against lesser competition, I think it would have fared a lot better financially.  However, after the box office failure of this movie and the cancellation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Enterprise-The-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B000AOEMXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Fourth Season</a>&nbsp;in 2005 (sadly, when the show was just coming into its prime, but that's another review for another day), when things looked dire indeed for Star Trek, Paramount placed the franchise in the capable hands of J.J. Abrams.  Abrams- along with the superior writing team of Bob Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof- gave us an excellent film in 2009. Hopefully, Abrams will give us another good entry in 2012-13.  As we await the next installment from Abrams-Orci-Kurtzman-Lindelof, I would highly recommend that Star Trek fans new and old check out this underrated and somewhat forgotten diamond in the rough from 2002.",1313366400,3,10057,5.802721088435374
1462521,4,B00005JLRT,"I remember first seeing Star Trek: Nemesis in theaters and being extremely disappointed. I thought it was too dark and was missing much of the ""soul"" of the Star Trek TNG series, which excelled at morality plays. However, in re-watching it recently, I've revised my opinion upwards, albeit it still doesn't rank as the greatest of the Star Trek films.

First, the bad. While the movie seems to contain an interesting moral message about the ""nature vs. nurture"" debate, it sacrifices that subplot on the alter of action scenes. The idea of Data and Picard confronting ""clones"" of themselves is intriguing, but the plot device bringing them together seems forced. In fact, the whole chase scene at the beginning seems gratuitous and out-of-place for a Star Trek film.

The second major problem with the movie is that director Stuart Baird seems unfamiliar with the ensemble nature of Star Trek TNG. After the initial scene, the movie becomes a ""Data and Picard"" show. The other characters only have minor roles. Geordi, Dr. Crusher, and Worf have little more than glorified cameos. While everybody loves Data and Picard, they work best when they can work with the other crew members. Admittedly, Deanna Troi gets to put her telepathy to good use, but her scenes, including a telepathic ""rape,"" almost seem more awkward than exciting.

Finally, the Remans and the Reman plot were simply not well executed. The Romulans would have been a perfectly good enemy for the TNG crew. They've always been manipulative and intelligent. By contrast, the Remans seem like a bunch of boorish brutes. They don't seem to plan any of the attacks or do much thinking at all, leaving that up to the human leader Shinzon. And the masks just don't look realistic. They look like Romulans wearing vampire masks. Their uniforms are shiny almost to the point of looking like disco suits. I suspect the producer and director thought the movie needed a more ""menacing"" enemy, but I think the Romulans would have worked better.

Having said all of that, the movie does work as an action movie, if not the most faithful of Star Trek films. It's entertaining and suspenseful. The threat to Earth is serious and Picard's response to it is appropriately grave. The space battles look beautiful, especially with the green nebula as a backdrop. The damage the Enterprise E suffers in the battle is shocking, even more so than the destruction of the Enterprise D in Star Trek: Generations. Seeing the enterprise in such disrepair really raises the emotional stakes.

Despite my earlier comments about the plot, this movie does have some wonderful ""Star Trek"" moments. I was ecstatic when I saw Riker and Troi's wedding - a moment anticipated since the very first TNG episode. The dialogue between Data and Picard about ""nature vs. nurture"" recalls the best of the TNG series. Picard's reaction to Shinzon's appearance and death are silent yet laden with thought. And, of course, the death of a beloved crew member at the end nearly made me cry.

While I wish I could unreservedly praise Star Trek: Nemesis, given that it is the last of the TNG films, my reactions are mixed. There's a lot of unrealized potential and far too many poor choices. Overall, I'd give the movie 3.5 stars.",1311724800,3,3247,4.8731884057971016
1462522,5,B00005JLRT,"This movie keeps my interest the whole way through. To me, that's one of the marks of a good work of entertainment. It's filled with bunches of creative and unexpected scenes. There are minor spoilers ahead.

There are many things in the movie that delight me. First of all, Deanna and Riker getting married. After years of just being ""very good friends"" and basically tiptoeing around professionalism in general, this was a sweet outcome for them. Picard's wedding speech was touching (and funny) too.

Also, Picard's dune buggy scene. Some say that his predelection for fast driving is uncharacteristic of him, but we must remember that for years we've only mostly seen his professional ""captain"" persona. Anyway, it's nice to see him smile.

Another thing I really liked was how they redesigned the Romulans to make them look less adversarial. Even their planetwide fashion of angular shoulders isn't so severe anymore. And the movie ends with the beginnings of a peaceful alliance between them and the Federation.

The one thing that I didn't like about the movie was B-4. He was little more than a paperweight, and one Data lookalike was enough.",1311638400,,1150,4.973958333333333
1462523,2,B00005JLRT,"I understand they're looking for new concepts, but Paramount seems to have forgotten why people watched Star Trek in the first place: because it teaches us about ourselves.

All they have to do is go back to the ToS intro: ""These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."" That statement changed as we did, growing and maturing with us. Sadly, Star Trek has stopped maturing.

Instead, Star Trek has become something darker, sinister, and violent. None of the light-hearted fun of ""The Trouble with Tribbles"". None of the camaraderie of ""Amok Time"". None of the Humanity of ""Measure of a Man"". Star Trek left this behind to become more war-like. And I think that's why people stopped watching.

But there are lots of ways to bring Star Trek back. Show what life is like at Starfleet Academy. Take us through a 4 year course, following a group of people. Bring back the 5 year missions. Bring back light-colored ships and interiors. Bring back character development. Bring back light-hearted fun with crew members who care about each other while reminding us that we are Human and still have a lot to learn.

But above all, turn down the violence. We don't want Star Trek's heart cut out just so Paramount can squeeze in yet another dramatic space battle. Star Trek is supposed to be Star Trek, not Star Wars.",1307836800,3,1451,4.723320158102767

But I think that Tom Hardy's performance alone is worth watching this film.  His transformation from cloned Pickard to evil cloned Pickard is bewitching.  Also, the special effects and over all story line are captivating.

1462528,1,B00005JLRT,"There is a theory amongst trekkies that Even films are Good and Odd films are Bad. Although true of all the other films, this rule breaks down with this film, which is devoid of any of the brilliant writing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Contact/dp/6305127638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Contact</a>, and lacks even the more mediocre writing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enterprise/dp/B000AOEMXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enterprise</a>.

This movie is filled with plot holes, cliche's and lazy sloppy writing - all the things that I never thought Star Trek would sink to. To start with, there is that 'happy families' scene at the start on the holodeck, followed by the contrived 'buggy racing' scene (just because they haven't done it before) and then there is the whole plot with Shinzon, which is desperately trying to be a 'devil twin' thing, but fails completely.

Overall, this film is so dreadful that I have thrown in the towel and joined the 'dark side'. Yes, that's right - I now believe that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B000FQJAJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;would win the battle against Trek not through weaponry or tactics, but through sheer relative Charisma (even with Anakin in tow - how uncharismatic can you get?)

As an interesting footnote to this film, isn't it interesting that the phrase 'grow a beard' meets its counterpoint in this film, when Riker shaves it off? If growing a beard is associated with TV series suddenly getting much better (based on Riker growing a beard in series 2) then I find it deeply ironic that, when Riker shaves off his beard in this film, Nemesis turns from an initially promising film to the pile of tripe it has become!",1298419200,,1861,5.962546816479401

1462530,1,B00005JLRT,"What I really dislike about Nemesis is the way it bungles the Romulans. You see, by the time this movie came out, the Romulans were the last credible villains left in the entire Star Trek universe. The Klingons, for example, haven't been interesting since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VI/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VI</a>. After that, they were reduced to medievalist caricatures. There was no way anyone could take their archaic capering as a serious alternative to a modern society -- and, in fact, their society and technology came to be constantly depicted as falling apart at the seams, until it was no longer even plausible that they were somehow still a major power. Even a patriot like Worf had to eventually admit his people's total ineptitude.

Who else was there? The Borg already appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Contact/dp/6305127638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Contact</a>, and besides, they've been played out. They're one-dimensional zombies who attack people in the dark, not exactly a cerebral challenge. Same for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dominion/dp/B00062RCC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dominion</a>, who never amounted to more than a bunch of comic-book supervillains. Nobody would ever willingly support them, their own soldiers and diplomats only did it because they were genetically engineered.

The Cardassians were a worthy enemy: ruthless, but also intelligent and charismatic, in a modern way. Their cruelty was a conscious, informed choice, which they could eloquently defend. They were fierce nationalists, but they loved their families as much as their ideology. But, of course, because&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronald-D-Moore/dp/B0036EH3UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronald D. Moore</a>&nbsp;had to prove that the Federation is the only true way, they ended up being almost totally annihilated and occupied at the end of Deep Space Nine. So they're out.

That leaves the Romulans as the only antagonists with a credible, modern alternative to the Federation. They were always in the shadows, but it seemed that they had a kind of authoritarian republic, ruled by a Senate. Their militarism had an egalitarian streak, with women holding high positions. The Federation was sufficiently intimidated by them to put an embargo on their consumer goods. They had potential.

But here, it turns out that their economy is based on slavery, another dull medievalist throwback. Disappointing, for a race that was always more about subterfuge than brute force. The slaves revolt and assassinate the entire Senate, which ends up being about ten guys in a small room. Come on, the Roman Senate in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleopatra/dp/B000BZISSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleopatra</a>"" looked more impressive than that.

Then, bizarrely, the rest of the movie is about how the slaves are worse than the masters. The Remans are these hideous, ghoulish bat-demon guys with sepulchral voices, as opposed to the prim, efficient Romulans. They can't organize themselves, so their leader is a non-Reman. This leader turns out to be a megalomaniac who wants to...destroy planet Earth. Oh man.

Obviously, the movie is copying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrath-Of-Khan/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrath Of Khan</a>&nbsp;with the personal vendetta thing. But Khan's hatred of Kirk was actually derived from the series, not incompetently invented on the spot. Furthermore, the original series was better suited to that kind of story, because it revolved around Kirk's epic personality more than anything else. But Picard is an intellectual, meant for modern, complex political interaction. A story that really focused on sneaky Romulans would have been perfect. They could have brought back Sela, who could have taken on Picard in a more plausible battle of wits instead of trying to blow up Earth.

Anyway, when Picard defeats a Reman ship, he tells the Romulans that the Federation won't interfere in their internal affairs. Hilariously, the movie first makes the Romulans into grotesque slave-owners, and then ends up defending this practice! I would compliment the writers on their admirably principled non-interventionist stance, but I doubt they understood their own message, if they had one.

The long scene on the desert planet is totally unnecessary. The part about B4 could have been wrapped up with a simple away team mission, or better yet, written out of the plot entirely because of its inanity. But no, we get a car chase involving space trucks. Apparently the director is so fond of truck racing that he was intent on putting it in at any cost -- no matter that the scene makes no sense, shows Picard blatantly violating Federation law for absolutely no reason, and looks really dumb.

And a lot of the action is limp. The Enterprise is fighting a super-intense space battle against the Remans, a Reman assault team has boarded the ship, but during this crisis the first officer of the Enterprise is off crawling through ducts chasing one guy (apparently the security system is incapable of trapping him). The sole reason for this is so he can be shown kicking the guy into oblivion, exactly like Kirk in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-III/dp/B00006G8HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek III</a>, not the high point of that film to begin with.

Basically, Nemesis is a complete waste of time. It was the worst of all the Star Trek movies, until they made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/another-one/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">another one</a>&nbsp;that's even worse.

1462647,3,B00005JLRT,"If you're looking for a good action movie and are not too familiar with Star Trek the Next Generation, I strongly recommend this movie. It has a good and original plot, good acting, and good action scenes. If you are a big fan of STNG, it is likely you might be unhappy with multiple aspects of this movie. For many STNG fans, character consistency and usage are key elements of the series; this is where Nemesis falls short. The STNG series has built up the highest standard of writing and consistency in characters and in story line of any show that I am knowledgeable on; this is part of what makes the STNG series great for me, and I believe the same is true for many other Star Trek fans. I do recommend this movie to all viewers, but I am going to list the problems that I had with it that other STNG fans might agree on.

***SPOILER ALERT BELOW*** the remainder of the review ***SPOILER ALERT BELOW***

The following points illustrate how the individual(s) who wrote the screenplay did not really understand the characters:

Here's an excerpt that applies:

""Star Trek: First Contact and Insurrection director Jonathan Frakes was not offered to direct; if he had, he would have accepted it again.[2] Frakes has gone on record that if he had directed Nemesis, the box office business would have been better than it was. He has said that director Stuart Baird (who had no prior knowledge of the franchise) is one of the reasons why the film failed at the box office.""(Wikipedia)

""Out of Character"" incidents - something that just does not happen in STNG - this will not be verbatim, but you'll get the point.

1) Captain Picard jokingly calls Commander Riker Commander Troi. Even considering that they have served together for many years at this point, it is a stretch to believe that Picard would joke like this to Riker in private, much less on the bridge, loud enough for common crewmen to hear.

2) Worf goes against Picard's orders. In the early years, Worf's mindset was battle first; he was not very level headed the first couple of seasons, but even then he would never go against the captain's orders on the bridge during a crisis situation. As the series progresses, Worf becomes a far better officer; it is obvious that the logic and diplomatic ideologies of Picard and the crew rub off on him. In one Nemesis scene, Picard tells Worf to not raise the shields; Worf begrudgingly obliges. Worf then discovers something about the confronting vessel that makes him say that he's raising the shields. If this were the Worf that I know, he would have consulted with the captain before going against a direct order. The only exception in a case like this would be if a photon torpedo was already headed directly at them.

3) When the sword impaled Picard's clone, Picard stood there frozen like a 1st year cadet. I understand that he was watching his young self die before his eyes, but this man has been through far worse, and is far too good an officer to freeze at a crucial moment such as this one. This moment alone would ruin a STNG movie for me.

Other problems

With the exception of Picard and Data, the characters did not have the rapport with each other that they have always had in past movies/seasons. In fact, aside from Data and Picard, and maybe Riker, most of the characters were not necessary to the movie in that they were far from integral to the story. One of the great things about STNG is that it always managed to get everyone involved, everyone had a major role. In Nemesis, Worf, Geordi, Troi, and Crusher were closer to being extras than characters with major roles.

Picard and Riker had little more to say to each other than ""It was an honor serving with you"" plus a handshake to complete 15 years of service together. I'd think that these two characters would have a lot more to share than that. This falls into the category of the lack of rapport that the characters had with each other.

It's safe to say that whoever wrote the screenplay didn't really understand the characters. It's one of those situations where some guy probably crammed and watched like 25 Star Trek Next Generation episodes in a couple weeks span then set out to make a movie about the series.",1289779200,,4208,4.588548601864181

I have no idea how the script was approved for filming, because it's all right there in the basic story - boring, and more boring. I guess the main drawback of the film is that it just seemed worn out, as if the story had been told one time too many.

This changes all of that, A LOT.",1277164800,,354,4.071428571428571
1462652,4,B00005JLRT,"OK, so we had several things going on here.  The story tends to plod along and does not really gel like some of the earlier Trek films.

Picard discovers that the Romulans experimented and created a clone of Picard (Jinsan) except this clone was discarded to Remus.  The story centers around family, or tries to.

The conflict between brothers, between ""siblings"" as it were, was a valiant try, but failed for me.

The performances fell flat -- the ramming of the ship into the ""theta radiation"" ship of Jinsan was not the best idea.  The conflicted Data dealing with his Data wannabe.  And Data's final fate was a disappointment.

Imagine if you will a director who really wants to off the franchise.  To really make this the last Star Trek film.  The Generation is getting lazy and slow.  The plot devices are getting stale and silly.

I feel this film was the final straw for Paramount.  The film was made for fans rather than a wider fan base.

And that's why JJ Abram's film Star Trek was the best -- it cleaned up this tired malaise of the Captain, the crew, the explosions, the last minute or else we die plot lines and breathed new life into the franchise.

Nemesis is the reason why!

Decent performances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis.

The director Stuart Baird knew nothing of Star Trek or its franchise before this film, so that might explain the cold reception at the box office.  Or that it ran against Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter!!

1462653,2,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek Nemesis.  The movie that is reputed to have killed the franchise.  This movie has the lowest box office return of any Trek film made to date, even lower than that of Final Frontier.  However, I really don't think the movie is quite as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  I think people's dislike for this movie stems from the fact that Star Trek was just starting to get old.  And Nemesis came out around the same time that Voyager and Enterprise were on TV, and both those shows are reputed to be the worst of the five Trek shows.  Nemesis suffers from being cliched and familiar.  Some people would go so far as to say that they copied and pasted Wrath of Khan's plot for this movie.  I wouldn't go as far as that, but I do think that this movie is nothing new, and it's too similar to previous Trek movies.  It's not a bad movie, necessarily, but it's too predictable and borrows way too much from better movies.  But first and foremost, Nemesis is just a dumbed down, dumb action movie.  Like what some people accused First Contact of being?  This actually was.  Almost every event that takes place in the ""plot"" is just an excuse to have a chase scene or fight scene.  With that said, let's get to the actual review.

The movie opens up with some Romulan senators being killed by some green mist that turns them into something dead.  Then they die.  After this, we cut to the wedding ceremony of Troi and Riker.  I don't want to go into much detail concerning this scene, but it sucked.  Basically, they did their best to make all the characters look like idiots.  Worf being drunk, Data singing that stupid song.........I don't want to go into it.  After that, the crew of the Enterprise heads toward Betazoid to have a wedding ceremony there.  On the way, they happen upon a positronic energy signal coming from the Kolaren system, near the Romulan neutral zone.  Positronic signals only come from androids, so they decide to investigate.  They get on a new shuttle (what's wrong with the transporters?) and fly down to the planet.  They find the android in scattered pieces on the planet surface.  As they are about to leave, a group of aliens attacks them.  A big chase scene ensues, and eventually our heroes escape.  Now here's the first example of why this is a dumb action movie.  That chase scene was decent, but what was it doing in the movie?  Who were the aliens?  Why did they want to kill Picard?  Did Shinzon tell them to kill Picard?  But if he needed Picard to do that operation thing, why would he want Picard dead?  Either way, this sequence is never mentioned again.  It was just there for a few thrills.  When assembled, the android looks exactly like Data.  It calls itself ""B-4""  However, it appears far less advanced than Data.  It does not know anything about itself, and does not know how it came to be on the planet.

The Enterprise is then contacted by Admiral Kathryn Janeway, (why is she an admiral now?) who orders them to go to Romulus.  The Romulan government has been overthrown, and Romulus is now controlled by a Reman named Shinzon.  This is surprising, because the Remans are usually regarded as an inferior race by the Romulans.  They are usually used as slave labor, or cannon fodder.  When they meet with Shinzon, they discover that he is not a Reman, he is a human.  He is, in fact, a young clone of Picard.  Shinzon explains to Picard who he is.  And this part, I thought was pretty interesting.  Years ago, agents within the Romulan government cloned Picard, through a hair or skin sample.  They were going to kill the real Picard and put Shinzon in his place.  They would have had a spy within the federation.  But before they could execute the plan, a new government took over Romulus.  They decided to abandon the plan, and sent Shinzon to die in the mines.  One Reman took pity on him, and protected him.  This Reman would later become his viceroy.  In later years, when Romulus went to war, they needed Remans as footsoldiers.  Shinzon was drafted.  He ended up rising through the ranks to a powerful military position.  And now he has taken over Romulus.  This could have been a very interesting villian.  He's someone who's been through hell, and he is a very personal adversary for Picard.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just one long action scene.

It turns out that Shinzon is dying, and he needs Picard so he can do a blood transfusion.  He uses the B-4 (Shinzon's the one who placed the B-4 in the Kolaren system, but why did he scatter the pieces if he wanted Picard to find it?) to hack into the Enterprise computer for some stuff that is never really explained.  Picard is then transported aboard Shinzon's ship, the Scimitar, along with the B-4.  However, Data is able to beam onto the ship and take the B-4's place.  He frees Picard, in another cool but pointless action scene.  The Enterprise crew heads back to federation space, but are ambushed by the Scimitar while passing through the Mutara....I mean a Nebula which disrupts some of their instruments, including their communications.  Remember how I said they borrowed from other Trek movies?  The Scimitar and the Enterprise have a long space battle which takes up about the second half of the movie.  Instead of developing Shinzon further, they just have a big fight scene.  The Scimitar can fire it's weapons while cloaked, which is not ripping off Star Trek 6 in the slightest.  Enterprise is outgunned.  Shinzon sends a boarding party aboard the Enterprise to capture Picard for the surgery.  Leading the boarding party is his Viceroy.  The team is stopped by Enterprise security, and Riker kills the Viceroy.  With his attempt to capture Picard having failed, Shinzon decides to kill everyone on the Enterprise, and then do the same to earth.  The Scimitar is equipped with thalaron, the green mist thing from the beginning of the movie.  Picard decides to beam over to the Scimitar and stop him.  The transporters only have enough power for one person to go, so Picard decides to go.  Even though the last time he tried to physically take someone on, Malcolm Mcdowell beat the crap out of him.  When Data offers to go instead, Picard responds ""this is something I have to do"".  Right, `cause it has to be a long, dramatic action scene.  Picard beams over, and transporters are rendered inoperative.  Data decides to act, and jumps from the Enterprise to the Scimitar.  I'm serious.  I know he's an android and everything, but still.  That was at least a quarter mile.

Meanwhile, Picard has killed just about every Reman on Shinzon's ship.  He comes in all by himself, and is able to take out seven or eight Remans with his phaser.  The Remans must have graduated from the imperial stormtrooper school of marksmanship.  Once he's killed all the Remans, he and Shinzon have a fight.  Picard kills Shinzon, but has only seconds to dismantle the Thalaron weapon.  Data arrives just in time to save Picard.  Data is carrying a prototype for the ETU (emergency transport unit).  He slaps it on Picard, and it beams Picard back to the Enterprise.  Data shoots the Thalaron weapon, destroying it and the Scimitar.  The parallel with Wrath of Khan is so obvious I won't even bring it up.  But what was the point of the big shootout?  Why did Picard have to transport to the Enterprise?  Why not send someone tougher, like Data or Worf?  And if he really felt the need to go himself, why not take the ETU thing with him?  Because they needed to have a cool action scene.  The crew mourns the loss of Data.  Picard says goodbye to Riker and Troi, who are off to take command of the Titan.  In a conversation with the captured B-4, Picard realizes that Data had previously downloaded his katra, I mean neural net, into the B-4.  The movie ends with the thought that Spock, I mean Data, might be able to come back.

Star Trek Nemesis.  Not nearly the worst thing to carry the name Star Trek.  Not a bad plot, just a familiar one.  This movie borrows way too much from better movies.  Also, the movie had an interesting premise, but it sidelines that premise to make way for the dumb action scenes.  Let me rephrase that.  The action scenes were good, but unnecessary.  Instead of focusing on good action scenes, they should have focused more on crafting a good story.  They could have done that, they had the potential.  Instead, they just crafted a familiar story, which goes where way too many Trek movies have gone before.  It's a shame that this had to be such a failure, both critically and financially.  But the thing is, Star Trek had simply gotten old and predictable.  Fans needed something new.  And in 2009, we got it.  But that's a completely different review.",1265328000,2,8710,4.5851755526658

The story is stupid, even by liberal Star Trek standards, and it contradicts other established story lines. It took four or five novels to fill in the blanks just to make the movie fit into Star Trek lore. It is no wonder the producers and writers of the latest Star Trek movie chose to re-start the entire series' story after this.

If you just want to see cool space battles, this is the movie for you.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you will be unhappy.",1264032000,,565,4.3619047619047615
1462655,4,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek Nemesis isn't new by any means... In fact I vaguely recall checking it out back in 2003 when it first arrived on DVD and though it did nothing to offend, the prose hadn't really stuck out in memory either.  As such I recently added the DVD to my collection in effort to complete my tour of the Star Trek motion pictures.  It has the distinction of being the tenth major motion picture of the Star Trek franchise despite the fact that Roman Numerals in the titles used to identify the films fell out of favor at Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.  Based on the timeline, character development, and full continuity of the Next Generation television series, Nemesis also (unfortunately) has the distinction of being the fourth and final film based on this crew.

Released originally in 2002, Star Trek Nemesis was directed by Stuart Baird, written by John Logan from a story initially developed by Logan, Brent Spiner (""Data""), and producer Rick Berman. The music score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, a man oft credited as being to Star Trek what John Williams is to Star Wars.

The story, though a bit complex for a couple-paragraph summary, goes something like this: Within the Romulan Imperial Senate, an argument is presented by the military that the time to strike the Federation is finally at hand. The Praetor (Romulus' version of a president) not only dismisses the aggressive proposal, he goes on to rebuke the military for their foolishness. In a very cool special effects filled sequence, a female senator arranges for the assassination of everyone in the chamber, including the Praetor himself.

In the mean time the crew of the USS Enterprise celebrates the wedding of first officer William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), a ceremony that promises to conclude fully nude on Betazed.
On their way to complete the ceremony, the crew discovers a positronic energy signal on a planet in the Kolaran system (near the Romulan Neutral Zone) that warrants investigation.  An away team consisting of Picard, Worf, and Data take a shuttlecraft down to the planet's surface then tool around in a really cool all-terrain-vehicle while discovering remnants of an android resembling Data.
Considering the ship's close proximity to the Romulan Neutral Zone, the Enterprise is then ordered by the Federation to conduct a diplomatic mission to the Romulus as apparently the Romulan government has undergone a military coup and is now controlled by a mysterious Reman named Shinzon.

Upon their arrival to Romulus, the crew learns that Shinzon is actually a clone of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, apparently built by the Romulans to replace the real Jean-Luc at the right moment. While he claims to want peace and freedom for the Remans (who raised him as a fellow slave), he also happens to occupy a most deadly warship called the Scimitar.

The film's greatest strength, were I to isolate a single trait, would have to perhaps be its ability to take the elements that made The Next Generation television series so successful and apply them directly to the realm of the motion picture medium.  A seemingly simple task that somehow manages to become lost in translation with the three Next Generation-based films that preceded it.  Possibly coincidental (as I do believe scripting has as much to do with it as does the directing), Nemesis represents the first in three Next Generation films where Jonathan Frakes did not serve as director.  As such, Paramount decided to go with English film director Stuart Baird, who confessed to having no prior knowledge of the franchise before coming on board.

The decision pays off in my opinion as the film is rife with solid pacing, interesting visuals, and some really slick editing (Baird's primary area of expertise happens to be editing).

At this stage in the game, the cast and crew of The Next Generation had the show's formula rolling like a well-oiled machine and it shows.  The character interaction is second to none and perhaps even more impressive is the actors' mastery of the tiny nuances of their character's personalities.  There's a relaxed vibe to the acting that ""grounds"" the usual suspension of disbelief associated with enjoying science fiction.

The visuals are surprisingly low key for the genre but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The era of the film's production was rife with computer-generated overload (perhaps no greater an example than Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones which was done entirely digitally).  Star Trek has traditionally been a franchise that prided itself on resisting falling into becoming a ""digital showcase"" by relying upon practical effects, even at painstaking time and difficulty.  Nemesis carries on with this tradition and the making-of bonus features contained on the DVD are certainly worth a look.

In all there is a bit of a twist at the end of the program that is sure to upset longtime devotees of the mythos but in keeping in mind that this film represents the final voyage of the crew, some sense of finality is to be expected.
There have been criticisms to the film stating that the formula was simply too ""long in tooth"" to continue any further and perhaps there is a hint of truth to such complaints within the prose.  However, as far as sendoffs go, Nemesis delivers with the right blend of believable technology, fiction, and drama to ensure that fans will think fondly of The Next Generation for generations to come.",1260057600,3,5484,4.9574700109051255
1462656,1,B00005JLRT,"The sheer face-palming stupidity of this movie is enough to make Insurrection seem even slightly reasonable.  At the very least, Star Trek Insurrection has the benefit of the doubt as to whether the bad guys stance of relocating the hippie-liberal people for medical breakthroughs could even work, as the medical miracle of the planet's atmosphere might be impossible to replicate, or impossible to distribute, or the hippie-liberal people would be willing to share it if only the wrinkly-faced bad guys would go away.

""Star Trek Nemesis"" has absolutely none of that.

Nemesis probably had a special place in my heart somehow for being the first Star Trek movie I fully and completely remember seeing in theaters when it first came out.  I'm 70% sure I saw Insurrection in theaters, and 30% sure I saw First Contact in theaters.

So maybe it had to take this long, or rather it had to take my maturing into an adult, and becoming a real Star Trek fan to realize the movie wasn't just a bust at the box office and franchise-killing, but was a complete mess of sheer stupidity!

So the story is our guys pretty much have nothing to do but wait for another Borg attempt (unless Voyager ensured that wouldn't happen any time soon), and Commander Riker is about to go off with Deanna Troi on a honeymoon, then captain his own ship.  But then suddenly comes Shin-Zon, who stages a coup on the Romulan Senate and takes control of the Empire with the military's backing.

For some reason, this is treated with a remarkable amount of hostility and uncertainty, despite the fact that the Federation and the Romulan Empire had been on hostile terms for many years, and that a sworn enemy of the Romulans had just taken over the Romulan Empire, and that this could lead to a great many new and interesting diplomatic developments between the two factions.

Ideally it SHOULD be treated this way, but that would probably take too long, and have too much ""exploring"" and ""negotiation"" and ""diplomacy"" and ""logic"", all the things a Star Trek movie SHOULDN'T have, right?  Oh wait, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT STAR TREK IS ABOUT!  At least you'd think that from the Original Series and the movies.

Instead, Shin-Zon is introduced and supposed to be someone to RIVAL KHAN NOONIEN SINGH in terms of sheer awe and power and evilness and such.  I have no idea of this is true, but I had heard that Rick Berman said that Shin-Zon would rival Khan, or even equal him.

Rather than be a snotty pessimist, I will simply say that this is not possible because the writers did not even try to portray it this way, or else their attempts to do so ended up being edited out of the final script, or completely forgotten about.

Shin-Zon is an artificial human created from Jean-Luc Picard's DNA by the Romulans.  They planned to have this clone created, rapidly aged, then inserted in Picard's place as captain of the Enterprise for some nefarious plan against the Federation.  Early on, this plan ends up being abandoned, and Shin-Zon is thrown away like garbage onto Remus, among the enslaved Remans.

One of the Remans there takes Shin-Zon in, after seeing how he is horribly treated by the Romulan overseers.  Shin-Zon grows up in an environment of hatred of Romulans, hard work and torture.  Somehow he manages to gain ahold of much power and influence amongst the Remans, and stages a coup in which he assassinates the entire Romulan Senate, and gains power of the Empire with its military behind him.

The vast majority of his story is over!  He can no longer be anywhere near Khan, because Khan's whole story was one that mirrored that of Captain Ahab in ""Moby Dick""---a lust for revenge so overpowering, it destroyed him and everyone he held dear.  Shin-Zon achieves his revenge without losing anything, it seems.

So here comes Jean-Luc Picard, his DNA twin, sent by the Federation to investigate, and even negotiate if possible!  He can do what has never been done before for the Romulan Empire; make a peace treaty between the Federation and the Empire that can see them united, break down the Neutral Zone, and be a powerful and dominating force together in a strong alliance!

Instead, because arbitrary action and ""Anyone who isn't a part of the Enterprise and has spooky evil music play whenever they come on-screen must be a bad guy"", Shin-Zon for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL decides he has to attack and destroy Earth and the Federation.  Brbbrbrbrb, WHY?!?! WHY?!?!? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?!

There is NO REASONING OR JUSTIFICATION AT ALL for Shin-Zon to arbitrarily ATTACK THE FEDERATION just because he's a clone of Jean-Luc Picard!  HE HATES THE ROMULANS!  EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLOT POINT AND KEY IN HIS BACKGROUND POINTS TO HIM HATING THE ROMULANS!  AND SUDDENLY HE HATES THE FEDERATION, WHY?!

This would be as if Khan, after marooning Kirk and taking the Genesis Project, decides to go and attack the Klingon homeworld.  WHY?!

So instead of making any sense and maybe, trying to hunt down the military elements of Romulus that DIDN'T support him, or preparing to put down attempted rebellions on Romulan colonies and territories that oppose him, or maybe trying to make sure the military is pleased with him and strongly backing him, instead of THREATENING THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD POSSIBLY QUASH YOUR NEFARIOUS PLOTS with random acts of violence for even DARING TO QUESTION HIM, Shin-Zon decides to threaten the only guy who could put an end to his life and reign, and go after Earth because Earth is good and good is dumb.

The rest is just fudge frosting on the cake of idiocy this movie takes.  This is a true franchise-killer, and while J.J. Abrams did good in ""reviving"" the franchise with ""Star Trek"", after this mess of a movie, anyone short of Uwe Boll could have revived the franchise.",1259366400,4,5778,4.743
1462774,3,B00005JLRT,"While I was tempted to get the new box set that that was coming out of all the TNG films leading up to the new film's release on DVD, when you're on a budget you go with what you can afford.

So I went the bargain route and got the original Special Editions of the TNG films to round out my collection and I couldn't be happier to finally have the full collection.

1462776,5,B00005JLRT,"When this film came out, I bagged seeing it. At the time I was disappointed with the direction of the Star Trek franchise and, ultimately, got burned out. My claim to Star Trek is that I saw the animated series during Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid, saw all of The Original Series (ST: TOS) and most of the Next Gen movies, TOS re-runs and all of the Next Generation (ST: TNG) episodes along with the first 2 or 3 seasons of Voyager and Deep Space Nine.

While ST: TNG was (and still is) an excellent addition to the Star Trek universe, what was the last straw with Star Trek was finding out about Paramount and, possibly, Ric Berman's alleged decision to steal J. Michael Straszynski's idea for Babylon 5 and use it for the Deep Space Nine (ST: DS9) series. However, despite this controversy, I think both DS9 and Babylon 5 are great despite the stark similarities between the two.

I was (and in many ways) still am disappointed with Ric Berman and company's decision to occasionally use time travel too. In my view, a story line becomes marginalized if the ability to go back in time and correct mistakes made in the present, past or even attempt to alter the future. Also, the science of the series under Berman's watch at times seems more like science fantasy than fiction.

I have to give credit where credit is due. When Rick Berman took the helm of the Star Trek franchise, his team helped it grow up. Star Trek is one of the few T.V. shows that (like fine wine) got better with age. For example, Next Generation went from being a campy, b-movie oriented show in its first season to a sophisticated show with excellent story lines and development of the show's characters such as Picard, Data and Worf.

As to this movie, I saw it last night and think it is the best of the Next Generation films. In this film, Captain Picard finds out he is a father (sort of) and has to act to stop not only the instagation of an intergalactic war, but also to check his clone's miserable upbringing while resisting Shinzon's demand that Picard submit to a blood transfusion so Shinzon can live. This film is definitely true to Star Trek's philosophy since with Picard's clone and Data's prototype you see the underlying humanist belief that self-improvement can correct the behavior of anyone. Including those who commit evil deeds or lack knowledge.

The action, acting and special effects are great! I was glad to see Will Riker not only get a promotion but also marry Deanna Troi. However, I was disappointed with what happened to Data. Yet it looks like he can make a comeback but in a different way. We see the result of Picard's development with his excellent, skillful command abilities as well as his perceptive take on his adversary. We also see Data's full development come to fruition by being a father figure to his prototype and, in the tradition of Spock, his heroic decision to save the Captain and crew of the Enterprise.

It is unfortunate that this movie did not do as well as it did at the box office and is jeered many by Trekkies or Trekkers as being the single movie that contributed to the ""Star Trek"" franchise's demise. My favorite Star Trek movies are III & VI. Yet I give ""Nemesis"" high marks not just because of it staying true to what ""Star Trek"" is about, but also for what it does not have.",1254441600,4,3327,4.527454242928453
1462777,3,B00005JLRT,"This movie seems to catch a lot of flack from Star Trek fans.  To hear them tell it, this movie single handedly destroyed the entire Trek franchise.  As someone who has seen every Star Trek episode ever produced, and all 11 films, I can tell you that Star Trek has had its ups and downs all the way through it.  Every series has more than a handful of mediocre to terrible episodes, and it seems like every other movie is bad.  Having said that, I love Trek anyway.  This movie is certainly not the best of the lot, but it's much better than Insurrection (the previous film), and I think it's better than Generations too.  It's certainly much better as a Star Trek film than the new JJ Abrams film.  My only complaint is that it favors action more than story, and the writers didn't give Worf and Geordi much of anything to do.  But, the action is well done and exciting, and there aren't any weird moments of characters acting out of style.

I would have liked to have seen a better send off for the Next Generation crew, but this is not the abortion that a lot of fans will have you believe.  I think the problem is that a lot of people were simply burned out on Trek by the time this movie was released, as it had been coming out non-stop for 15 years by the time this was released.  If you enjoy watching Star Trek, and especially if you like the Next Generation cast, you will almost certainly enjoy this movie.  I would say that, as far as Trek goes, this movie is close to par, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely thrilling.

The story had the promise of galactic scope and great import to the audience.

True, Picard and Data have a lot of ""character moments"" where they get introspective and philosophical, but since those moments are brought out merely as the story forces them to re-evaluate their lives, they are more plot element than character points.

One of the elements that contributes to the problems with this movie is the fact that it is directed by Stuart Baird, a film editor and a Star Trek neophyte. Granted, this is not the first time Star Trek has used ""less experienced"" directors. Star Treks III, V, Generations, and First Contact were all directed by people who were doing their first ever feature film, and Star Trek II was only Nicholas Meyer's second directorial outing ever. So lack of directorial experience is not necessarily insurmountable, but it is not encouraging.

Also, Nicholas Meyer too was a Star Trek neophyte when brought on to direct II. However he delved into Star Trek to better understand it and realistically portray it on screen. In contrast, Baird reportedly reveled in his lack of Star Trek knowledge and insisted on simply making the movie he wanted.

The script was written by John Logan, a Star Trek fan and the writer of the screenplays for ""Gladiator"", ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""The Aviator"". So the story should have worked better than it ultimately does. There is a great movie to be made here out of this story. But it just doesn't satisfy like it should. (Me, I blame the director.)

It's nowhere near as inane, talky and bland as THAT cinematic TNG installment was, but you STILL wonder where the rest of the movie is! There are no ""hooks"" in this movie....! Nothing GRABS you like it should, like the better TNG TV eps like ""Best of Both Worlds"" or ""Contagion"" did. (And wouldn't the movies have been a great medium to further delve into THAT unfinished story??)

Picard has a clone within the Romulan empire. Big hairy deal! There's a double of ANOTHER major character in the film, too! One of the things that always p****d me off about the TNG show was the lazy writer's device of making yet another ""double character"" episode! They almost ALWAYS stank after the first use of this device!

The film opens up on Rolmulus...(btw, the Romulan throne city exteriors look JUST like they did on TV...like obvious miniatures.) And we are witness to what amounts to the reverse of what happened to Julius Caesar, with Romulan senators killed off within the first five minutes. THEN the intrigue starts in earnest!

What might bother you in this movie is: Why is Earth never actually threatened? Or Vulcan? Or the Klingons? This all pretty much stays in the Romulan system, well away from the doorsteps of the classic Romulan enemies. Just think of the tension that being in the Terran, Klingon or Vulcan systems would have engendered vis a vis the Romulans against the full bore complement of Federation or Klingon fleets! And forgive me, but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Picard's clone just wasn't over-the-top villainous enough for my tastes! He was TOO muted and just doesn't seem like that much of a threat! Anybody who plays villains ought to be forced to watch a few movies starring Rutger Hauer or Richard Lynch as the bad guys, since these guys pretty much wrote the book on truly evil acting in movies of the last 30 years.

And yes, we lose good old Data in this one, but don't despair....! There's a ready-made replacement for him in B-4, who, I GUARANTEE you, has probably had a chip implanted in him already that will bring him up to Data's speed eventually in future stories, (probably as TV movies,) of the TNG crew.

While this is MUCH better than ""Insurrection"" as a movie, it STILL feels too much like a less than truly stellar TV episode, ""Insurrection""'s biggest fault.

Least ways, it's STILL better than ""Enterprise""! ;-)",1222214400,,2435,4.74468085106383

I have been a Star Trek fan since the early 1970s as a child, but am not a trekkie.

1462900,4,B00005JLRT,"First, let me state I dislike about two thirds of the classic, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise content out there.  Still, I'll watch them, because scene to scene they have their moments and there are some very stellar (no pun intended) episodes scattered throughout.

Next, I want to dis this film for some legitimate reasons.  To have Wil Weaton in the reception scene sitting next to his mom and then not use him in any other part of the film was ridiculous.

I'm geeking out here, but considering Tasha Yar's daughter is Romulan, you'd think we'd encounter her as one of the Romulan commanders later in the film.  Since this is the final ""future"" Trek film, that would have been fitting to get all the cast members in.  How did they miss that one?

The scene with Data and Picard in his Ready Room drinking wine and speaking of human ritual & bonds (I think that's what it was, it's been a while) should not have been cut. It's essential for both showing the audience more of the friendship between those two, the significant of the Chateau Picard wine toasted later in the film, and the poignancy of Data's sacrifice.  That cut was not only unnecessary, but detrimental to the film's arc.  Forget the ""tempo"", ""momentum"", or ""rhythm"" of the film.  We're not talking action scenes, here.

The bat imagery and inspiration was a bit, how do I put this mildly, overt.  No, that's too kind.  It was beating me over the head with a big, dead, stinky bat, like some junior high student short story's grand creative stroke.  Less is more, folks.

Finally, my biggest issue in the film, and one I probably let get in the way of my enjoyment of it, was the whole WMD, terrorism, and pro-Iraq invasion slant I perceived.  Now, the virgin terrorist bent on world domination with an awful WMD is something clearly Spiner and friends intended in the script.  The Iraq part was probably just my distaste with what was happening in the media at the time being unjustifiably channeled into the viewing.  I can't be sure, but I suspect that was unintentional and was just some bad luck in the timing of the film's release.  But, hey, maybe my first instincts were right.

Nonetheless, like I said, I was too harsh on the film in the theater.  I was fuming, pissed even.  For the seeming Iraq slant, for Data's sudden death without the proper preparation and arc, for the soft, overly-groomed (common recent Trek problem), cheesy-looking Romulan Senate cgi scenes.  However, in retrospect, and especially considering that one scene I mentioned previously that should not have been cut, I think the film is mostly in the right place.  The ship to ship battle sequence at the end is masterful, combining all the techniques originated in the earliest TNG video games and novels, giving realistic division-of-tasks on the bridge, and presenting the events with a ""truthiness"" (finally, a use for that word!).  They were 3D, dynamic, nuanced, and believable within the established rules and technologies of this franchise.

The short-hand and camaraderie between this troop of actors is here in full force.  I think they're right up there with the cast of MASH, quite frankly, and I'd put these actors in an echelon above that due to the serious and challenging subject matter they've dealt with over the years, not to mention the films. I really can't think of any other ensemble that's of this caliber, each and every one of them.  I'm still not certain the best aura of the series was ever captured in any of the films, but in this one I almost felt they arrived at something more.  Some of the kidding was put aside.  Not all, but more than most of the episodes and films.  There was a mature professionalism exuded by the characters.  Individuals well into the prime of their professional and personal lives, dealing with the threats, changes, growth, and loses life entails.

The film's look, I have to point out before wrapping this up, is gorgeous.  The Romulan senate has that awful overly-groomed thing going on, like I said.  In the rest of the film, however, the textures, lighting, pure white lights to subtle colors, those lens flares, the fascinating hue of Data's skin and eyes...often all of this happening at the same time!  A feast for the peepers.  This is without a doubt not only the finest-looking Star Trek outing, but a striking visual achievement, by any standard.  It is not a five star film in my book, but in my opinion it was worth another look.  I know I'll be returning to it some more.  With reservations, but worthy nonetheless.",1219536000,,4551,4.718631178707224
1462901,3,B00005JLRT,"What a sad, depressing way to pretty much end an amazing franchise, Star Trek Nemesis, the tenth film in the series, finally ended the Trekkie theory that every even numbered movie was colossal while the odds were medicore at best. The early 2000's weren't a good time for the franchise, with ST:Voyager ending it's run less than a year earlier and leaving ST:Enterprise alone and not doing a good job ratings or storywise. This was the third solo Next Generation film (not counting '94's Generations which was old with new casts), and the appeal was stating to really, really wear thin.

Once again the Next Gen crew are sent on a typical mission (much like the previous film, the ""hippie-like"" Insurrection) to speak to a missionary representative of a subrace of the Romulans known as the Remans, who look nothing like them with their white disfigured bat-like faces. But when Captain Picard and crew get there, they find out their new leader is actually a twenty-something clone of the Captain known as Shinzon. He says all he wants is peace between the three parties, but of course in true Star Trek fashion his real mission is to destroy the Romulan Empire, the Federation, and his dopperganger Picard himself.

Sure, the special effects are up to typical Star Trek fashion but that's all they reach, which is typical. Not much new is going on here except for an out-of-place, land based, dune-buggy race (in Star Trek?) and many endings/beginning of the ST:TNG storyline. After a twenty year courtship, Riker and Troi are getting married and leaving the Enterprise (with Riker getting his own command), and Data discovers another android like him, though not as intelligent, that he refers to as his brother known as B-4....get it, ""before""....all while glossing over the fact that Data's had a brother before in the series known as Lore that this movie completely ignores.

I think that cast and crew knew when making this film that the franchise truly had dried up at this point. There just wasn't much more to do with this crew and it shows all around. While die-hard Trekkies will find this entertaining, this was not the way they should have ended it. Tom Hardy as the younger Picard clone does look & sound alot like Patrick Stewart (minus a much larger upper-lip), but as a main villain he has no spark or appeal like ones in the past and Sci-Fi favorite Ron Perlman as his viceroy doesn't make things any better. And in true desperate writing fashion, one important main cast member dies, though like Spock earlier yet alot easier, could come back just like nothing ever happened.

As for the Paramount 2 Disc Special Edition, like the others it's filled with amazing CGI menus, detailed behind-the-scenes footage, and tons of extras, but after seeing the film realizing that it didn't work as well as Picard and crew are now forever in drydock, you might not want to see them to know more of what went wrong. Though, even if you're a somewhat Star Trek or Sci-Fi fan, you'll should see this to know how it all ends, but don't expect a great warp into the sunset like Shatner's cast did in Part Six. Seeing Nemesis, it will probably explain to you why it's taking seven years to make another film, plus being a reboot going back to the Original Series storyline instead of continuing this one. But you never know in the world of Star Trek, maybe in the future we'll see Picard, Riker, and Data again....yes, even that third guy.

1463059,5,B00005JLRT,"My apologies up front, but my review of this film, and reaction to some of the other reviews present, is more personal and less detached than reviews of this type usually should be. But where Star Trek is concerned, my opinions are more emotional, and even deeply  more personal than usual for TV and film subject matter.  If this will derail you, read no further.
After watching so many people regurgitate their semi-informed views on the state of Trek and recent projects, and this film in particular, I have abandoned my ""to each their own"" stance on the subject, and will have my say.
Another reviewer writes: ""I'm simply amazed at how many Star Trek fans abhor this movie! I guess I'm not enough of a Trekkie to understand the hatred, though I have been a fan since the 1970's.""
I was thinking the opposite. I myself have been a fan since the '70's. I believe that makes people like us ""real"" fans, and provides sufficient credentials to have an opinion. At first I also wondered why so many bad reviews. Then, I realized, in settings like this, you are not seeing the opinions of Star Trek fans. You are getting the opinions of ""a majority of the people."" Big difference. Star Trek never was truly appreciated by a majority of the people. A majority of the people apparently thought the original series should be cancelled....
Asking people who probably did not truly ""get"" Trek, and what made it work to begin with, to rate which movie is the best, is like asking my mom and dad (children of the 50's) if Iron Maiden is a great band, and just taking their word for it. Not the proper audience.
You have people that are too young to appreciate the original, and wish it were more like Babylon 5, or folks that think Sci-Fi should run like a reality show. But, I digress....
Nemesis is, along with Star Trek II, probably one of the best of all Trek films. (As a true cinematic artwork, and excellent overall expression of the ""Great Bird"" 's original concept for ST without the limitations of weekly serial TV, Star Trek: The Motion Picture tops them all, and has not been surpassed. But, it lacked the sting of battle, heat of conflict, and the shrill squeal of phaser fire that fans craved.) Like Star Trek II, Nemesis has its share of flaws and inconsistencies, but like STII these are out shined by the action, drama, and spirit of adventure. These were seriously lacking in TNG episodes and films, and this final TNG piece seems to have been given a major transfusion of TOS blood. Ironic that yet again, when Paramount finally gets it right, they again nip it off at the bud because box office returns weren't exactly what they wanted, after trying this exact formula with newer TNG cast a total of ONE time. Those of us long suffering fans have come to expect nothing less from them.  If it is time to let Star Trek be, it is not because its potential is gone, it is because those to whom the reigns have passed do not know how to utilize it creatively, and refuse to listen to the people who really watch it loyally: Longtime Fans. Not the ""bloggers"" online that tune in now and then when taking a break from World of War Craft, or there is nothing good on Sci-Fi Channel. I hate to say it, but: If you don't like this film, you probably just don't like Star Trek anyway, and should just go watch your old episodes of ""Earth2"", and leave this fine film, and its fans in peace.",1218067200,,3389,4.47172859450727
1463060,4,B00005JLRT,"The Good Things
*Lots of cool action and special effects.
*Very different filming style.  Much more vivid and interesting use of colors and camera angles.  Also a bit darker and more dramatic.
*Storyline is interesting.  It's cool to finally see the Romulans in a film.
*Characters are smashing.  There are lots of paralells involved; Picard vs his clone, Data vs B-4 (his clone), Troi vs that ugly alien, Riker vs the same ugly alien, and so on.  Duality is the key point, and it makes for some very interesting interactions and dialogue.
*Writing is good.  Not so much comedy, but definately lots of drama.
*As mentioned above, strong themes of duality.
*Okay music.

The Bad Things
*The ending is a little dissapointing.  Data is dead, the Enterprise is destroyed again, and everybody moves onto different paths.  It almost warrents a whole new Star Trek TV series.

The Questionable Things
*It's almost too different.  Definately a strange departure from previous films.

I didn't really like this one at first, but I'll be darned if it didn't grow on me.  The action and special effects are very slick and cool.  Above all, there are a lot of interesting issues involving duality between the characters, with the Romulans, and overall light and dark.  It's dark and deep, but also a little too dreary and different.  Still, it's very interesting and entertaining.

The one-disc version had good video and sound quality, and had some deleted scenes and featurettes.  The two-disc version has good quality still, some of the same extras, plus additional featurettes.",1217808000,,1569,4.992277992277992
1463061,3,B00005JLRT,"I had stayed clear of this film mainly on recommendations of others, but when the Special Collectors Edition Series came along, I could hardly resist it. As Sci Fi Films go its not bad, but as a Star Trek film goes, I'll take a Captain Kirk film any day. I thought the basic story line was quite good, in the sci fi sense, but a total goose in the Star Trek Sense. Its not hard to  see why things went to horribly bad in the film, the director, as well as the principal writer were all non-trek oriented ( the main writer did admit to being a ""Trekkie"" however, when his idea
of advancing a plot was the glasses in Star Trek 2 that Bones gave to Kirk, then somethings wrong), also you can see how much of a heavy hand the Studio had in the edits with the deleted scenes... some of the most ""Star Trek"" styled moments just got the chop. Nemesis is a Good Sci-Fi film, but a superb example of how a franchise film is wrecked in the ""do a film by Committee"" style of film making that has so successfully killed many films.

THE DVD: Great Extras. Lots of informative material in the commentaries, and in the disc 2 extras. Great to see Ron Perlman out of Makeup and without his digitally enhanced voice as Vice-Roy ( which he plays in NEMESIS).Very Good Collection of Interviews and lookbacks.",1214092800,2,1290,4.304526748971194

1463063,2,B00005JLRT,"Oh my, I believe this must be the worst Star Trek movie, if you look closely, it is indeed. The worst is that it could have been very good with the Romulans, but they totally threw it away with a totally unbelievable story. All bad reviews here are in most points absolutely right, I will add the villain's motivation: why Shinzon must blow Earth to pieces? Why does he hate Picard? In all Star Trek movies all bad guys have a clear and straightforward (and even understandable) motivation, even Soran in Generations. And 80 years later, after Kirk destroyed a cloaked Bird of Prey which can fire, the Enterprise-E missed a lot of shots, what the heck?! No evolution in weapons technology in the 24th century? And the Romulans only send two war spaceships to blast Shinzon?! Even the best Star Trek movies have plot holes, but this one is the mother of them all, totally bombarded area! And the car chase...the commentary says it all: Brent Spiner thought a car chase would be great...come on! Wouldn't the Enterprise give a call to the team and warn them about approching lifeforms with plenty of time, or even before they went down to the planet?? The B4 subplot is pointless, anyway.

I could go on and on (enough have been said about the Wrath of Kahn rehash). It's sad that the producers and writers did not have the intelligence to write a good story, a lot of good fans would had come with better stuff, lets give it a try: The Romulan Empire is seized by a new bloody sovereign (no Picard clone or funny looking aliens, please), the Enterprise and Riker (at last promoted to captain) in his ship, The Titan, are sent as an olive branch, even some Klingon ship could be involved, but is a trap and all hell breaks loose as they fight along with Romulan disidents to turn the bloody sovereign and his fleet to space dust. There you have it, much better Nemesis in one shot!

The good things are few: I liked the dark tone of the movie, the FX and some space action sequences, the Enterprise bridge blown away was cool, but they are not enough to redeem a poor script and heartless execution.

Trek fans who despise films as The Motion Picture, The Final Frontier or Generations, should look twice: at least these movies, with all their faults, have a sense of adventure of some people doing star treking, those stories are faithful to Science Fiction; I despised Insurrection, but at least it raises a moral dilema (albeit very ligthly), but Nemesis is just a pointless and unsuccesful exercise in Science Fiction, drama and cinema.

I'm very sorry for the cast, for around 15 years they entertained us well, they deserved a better farewell. Since First Contact Paramount failed to deliver and the whole franchise is endagered, lets hope the new Star Trek will make it up to the fans.",1211241600,2,2790,4.596385542168675

I first saw this movie in the theater, and just recently watched it again on DVD. I loved the movie both times. Sure there are some ""How can that possibly happen?"" moments, but Star Trek has always required a suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy it; and I don't think the stretches of imagination are that big in this movie to be off-putting.

This movie is definitely one of the more action-oriented of the franchise, but the action (along with the special effects) is well done and is fun and often edge-of-the-seat suspenseful. There is also the cerebral aspect in the question of what makes a human a human, and how a human being's past experiences are what really make him what he is - more so than his genetic makeup. I think Data finally realizes in this movie that he is a true individual and possesses the same quality that makes a human a human, which was a great moment to me.

The main villain Shinzon is very well acted, and his blind anger that has been brewing though years of abuse and his intelligence make him an intimidating and formidable foe. Yet he still has that sense of dignity and formality that you can imagine has been instilled into the Picard family line for generations. I also really like how dark and secretive the Remans are portrayed - particularly by the Viceroy. You get just enough of a glimpse into their culture to make sense of Shinzon's past, but not enough to understand them completely. It leaves you intrigued about them, and hopefully we will see more of them in the future.

Overall, this is a great ""Next Generation"" movie though not quite up to the level of the outstanding ""First Contact.""

I also must say that the special features included with this movie are some of the best of all the ""Collector's Editions"" for the Star Trek movie series - very enjoyable to watch.",1208736000,,1994,4.512465373961219
1463065,3,B00005JLRT,"Being a long-time fan of Trek and especially of the Classic and DS9 incarnations, I've always had a bittersweet relationship with the ST:TNG concept.  I've never been able to understand the need for a ship's counselor as a senior member of the staff with a place on the bridge especially when you have an equally if not more competent Guinan and located where she should be to be an effective counselor i.e. as a bar tender.

I've also wondered just what role Beverly Crusher plays other than just to blindly copy the Bones McCoy character from classic trek.  I detest the whole ridiculous Q storyline and overall, I found ST:TNG a totally miscast and unbalanced series except perhaps for Picard, Riker, Data, Jeordie and Worf.  And so it has always been painful for me to watch most of the episodes let alone the movies and yet with the exception of the Borg movie, I've enjoyed the ST:TNG movies the least and although this ""final"" one has some good points going for it. I can't help but feel that I've been shortchanged in some way.

The whole dark mood of the film just wasn't Trek for me while it probably would have fit in say a Batman movie like say a movie of the ""Dark Knight Returns"" or something like that, this gothic type feel just didn't fit for me in this movie.  I've watched it a few times and perhaps it will grow on me but each time I watch I get the feeling in my tummy that I get when I eat a heavily hyped up meal that just didn't deliver.

The dvd though has decent special features with a few documentaries and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very good although I regret not getting the widescreen version instead of this full-screen version and I wonder if they could have gotten a DTS sound option included as well.

Overall, I think if the mood was more ""Trek"" instead of this ""Jack the Ripper"" gothic type thing, I would have probably enjoyed this a lot more.  Also, one of the deleted scenes was very amusing with the new number 1 trying to please Picard as well as the chairs with seat belts which really should have been included in the main picture and they would have certainly helped with the cheerful mood that is sadly missing in the picture.  Hopefully they would be included in a future director's cut that is brighter and has more of a ""Trek"" feel to it.

However the movie isn't good either.  Its mediocre, and yes, the crew did deserve a better good-bye.
The plot-well, it ahem, cough cough, doesn't really make much sense.  Its as if the writer wanted to create a WWE style battle where Picard fights some serial 2-dimensional 60s style comic book villian, & did every little short cut to get the movie to that battle, even if it didn't make sense or fit with what's been established in Trek.  It presents Trek as if its an adolescent genre more on the order of Masters of the Universe or some other sci fi for kids.
Its a shame.  Trek at its best appealed to intellect, a hope for a better future, & showing humanity have a place in that future.
The things I liked about the movie-it has some nice though not spectacular effects.  There is tight suspense in the film during the long battle.
I would reccomend against buying this DVD even if you're one of those people that happened to like the movie.  Why?  Paramount once again is screwing with you & trying to get you to buy multiple DVDs of the same movie.  Yes there is bonus footage not seen in the movie on this DVD, but not all the ""cut scenes"" are here.

I thought the series was incredible and definately one of the all time sci-fi greats. I'm a proud owner of all the Star Trek TNG Season DVD sets and I even enjoy the Generations and Insurrection movies! But this movie is just absolutely horrid with suprisingly no redeeming qualities. I mean at least 'The Final Frontier', which is widely regarded as Trek's worst, had its -characters- fronting the film. I didn't recognize anyone in this disaster.

The writing is very weak with most of the characters completely ignored. I think Geordi has 2 lines throughout the enitire movie, which on top of everything are delivered badly. He, as well as most of the others looked tired and uninspired by the script. The person that wrote this screenplay didn't know the characters half as well as the average TNG fan. He simply got all of the characters WRONG. Picard does things he never would do, Data isn't himself at all and appears bitter throughout the movie, etc. The actual storyline is laughable and it seems like the plot was developed around the redundant action sequences rather than the other way around.

Every Star Trek movie from Trek 1-9 and all the shows including Voyager and Enterprise have atleast some element of the Star Trek spirit. This film is completely devoid of that spirit. If you are a self-respecting Star Trek (or TNG) fan avoid this like the plague. The story ends so badly for our beloved characters that it simply isn't worth seeing. I mean it, this movie will leave a bad taste in the mouth of any real trek fan and ruin a legacy. TNG ended with the masterful final episode of the series ""All Good Things"".

I thought about this movie awhile before writing this review. I can easily capsulize those feelings by creating two ""Alternate Titles:""

1.) Attack of the Clones
2.) The Picard and Data Show.

Both Picard and Data had ""evil clones"" that were involved in a plot that could destroy the Earth. The rest of the Enterprise crew played bit parts, in comparison.

I liked their stories, and the way they came together. I like the inevitable ""death"" of a major character. (Reminds me of Spock's ""Death."")

I continue to be totally disappointed with Worf's performance. This guy is a Klingnon, and supposedly one of the stronger crew members. But I swear he's lost every fight he's been involved in. It was so pitiful to see Worf whining about the after-effects of Romulan wine, and about the upcoming nude wedding for Counsellor Troi and Will Riker.

Just once I'd like to see Worf get involved in a fight, and beat the ever-loving tar out of someone. Ok... beat him up, but don't kill the enemy.

1463180,4,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis may be the most mature of the many Star Trek movies. Maybe that's why so many fans dislike it; but, if so, that's a terrible disappointment. Star Trek has always been as much about great ideas as about futuristic technology, explosions, and trysts with exotic aliens.

Nemesis is the complete package: a movie about great ideas--humanity, identity, and the freedom to choose--that is also action-packed. Better still, the audience is left to think about those ideas for themselves while the sermonizing is kept to a minimum and the crew gets on with blowing things up.

Take a look at the deleted scenes on the DVD to see exactly how this was made into a good movie instead of a tired rehash: several scenes that would have slowed the pace while the characters pontificated about the obvious were whittled away. Unfortunately, a charming alternate ending with some Trek in-jokes was also cut. Leaving it out did make a better movie, but don't miss the funny bit about the seat belt--at last! Nemesis may not be the very best of the Star Trek movies, but I'm sorry I missed it in the theater.",1185926400,,1099,4.71875

I looked forward to Nemesis mainly because of the Romulan angle.  To me, they are the most intresting group that never received their full due in any movie.
I felt that the plot was very weak and was ok for a one time viewing.  I know with all the great stories on the shows that someone could have written a better movie.

1463183,3,B00005JLRT,"its not the worst film I've ever seen. (a few Spoilers below)
The main problems are that the story doesn't hold up to being made as a movie. I could have seen this as a special mini series or something. Everything seemed so THROWN together at the last minute and there were many gaps on continuity from DS9 and the original TNG. I hated the idea of Worf leaving his position with the Klingons to stay with Star Fleet knowing he can never move up in position, no possible way for him to be promoted ever...yet this movie makes it seem like he is doing just that. I liked the idea of him staying with the Klingons as was shown in the last episode of DS9.
What helped me give this movie 3 stars is that the deleted scenes made the movie better in my opinion, and should have been included. That shot with Spot and Worf answered my question as to what would be done with his things and what ever happened to Spot (though I can't see Worf keeping him...they should have had Deanna in the room with Spot and Spot going to her that would have been touching and more plausible). I liked seeing Admiral Janeway too, really helped bring the shows together.
Also it was nice how the extended ending had a new XO come on board and that joke with the captain's chair was nice.
Without the extras, however, I would only give this 2 stars. It was a disappointment for a true fan of the ST universe.",1181952000,4,1383,4.262357414448669

I'm glad to see that they continue to bring the ""technology"" further into the future and that they allow the characters to grow and receive some ""promotions"" as side stories in it all.  All in all, I have to say that I wasn't really disappointed with this movie and have added it to my collection.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you should buy it.

1463297,1,B00005JLRT,"""nemesis"" is simply the worst of all the star trek films...maybe they were just trying to make ""generations"" look so much better (which is a hard feat, i'll admit)...

but, my major complaint is, not the writing so much, as the people that green-lighted this script...

i could have written this with my eyes closed, and when i opened them, i would have thrown it out...

after all, do i really want to steal from every 'cliche' in the book, including the death of spock at the end of ""wrath of khan""...

it's obvious the writer knew star trek lore...it's evident in every scene...and it's played out that way as well...

yes...it's good to know what you are writing about, but...if you just write what has already been written, it not only has no point to it, but it also cheapens it in the worst way, making the 'star trek' movies seem redundant, and pointless...

i don't cherish the thought of the 'new' trek movie, possibly featuring matt damon as a young kirk (please tell me this isn't just going from bad to worse), because, you know that, the only people who will like that movie, are the same people who enjoyed the dreadful 'bourne identity', and anything else that lets medicore stand for something nowadays...

please...paramount, or whoever now is in charge...this series has meant too much to you...to it's fans...to tv and movie alike...do not go gently into that good night...(and certainly, not on this note...)

if you need a quick refresher course, just look at the 'posters' for the original 'star trek' movies...

all six had purpose, and they just didn't leave it to a close-up of the (debatable) two main actors with the 'federation logo' stuck somewhere around them...

if you can't put any effort into the advertisment, then what does that say about the movie it's advertising...

the poster for 'undiscovered country' was more interesting to look at than any of the 'tng' films...(and yes, i'm including 'first contact' in that statement...let's face it...the borg are pretty boring...)

and, to add insult to injury, just to prove my point about 'not putting any effort into it'...

the original title of 'first contact' was supposed to be 'ressurection', to keep that 'tion'-thing going from 'generation'...but...

'alien: ressurection' was coming out, so they changed it...not to the obvious choice 'assimilation', which would have continued that 'tion-thing' and also would have gone well with the movie...

no, they just went for some 'quick-fix' who-cares anyway title, that, like the movie, had no real purpose that a 40-minute tv episode couldn't have resolved, and to see the beautiful deana troi drunk...

oh yea...that's a winner there...

i could go on, but what's the point...if they aren't going to put this much effort into their writing, why should i...",1177891200,4,2796,4.927505330490405
1463298,3,B00005JLRT,"Closing out another chapter in the epic universe that is the Star Trek franchise wasn't going to be easy because of the huge amount of Geek-Fan scrutiny.  No show that had/has that kind of fanbase was/is ever going to end in a way that all the fans will appreciate. Never going to happen!!!!Not LOST. Not Battlestar Galactica. Not 24.  Not The X-Files.  And certaininly not Star Trek The Next Generation.  The newer version of the exploits & adventures of Kirk & Spock, TNG was definitely more PC and yet still had alot of guts.  The SFX department had definitely improved and once the old Star Trek fans embraced TNG there was no looking back.  So,  as with the death of Kirk in the abomination that was Generations, the end of TNG wasn't ever going to satisfy everybody.  Or anbody.

On the way to Troi & Riker's honeymoon, the crew of the Enterprise pick up a positronic signature from a planet near the netral zone, actually in Romulan space, that could only be that of an Android like Data.  They head down to a planet and pick up the pieces of a prototype of Dr. Noonian Soong that appears to be an early version of Data.  Meanwhile, the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire Shinzon,  sends word that peace is to be made between the Romulans and the rest of the Federation.  Another swing about to visit the planet of Romulus.  Shinzon is the clone of Captain Picard.  In actulity, he needs Picard's genetic materal because he's breaking down.  Apparently the Romulan technique of cloning leaves much to be desired.  Was Data's  android brother a plant by the Romulans to get the Enterprise into Romulan space?  Is Shinzon a psychotic puppet madman bent on the destruction of the entire Federation?  Do the Romulans plan to destroy Earth?  All signs point to YES!

The movie is visually stunning as any Star Trek movie should be.  But the plot is weak and there is just an air of forboding encoded in each scene that leaves even the casual Star Trek TNG fan with a bad taste in their mouth.  Killing off a main character, a beloved character (Data), to signify the end of a series always seemed so ludicrous to me.  I can't imagine why the makers of TNG would want to leave their fans with that kind of morbid, thought-melting ending.  The fans want closure.  Not chaos.  Overall, Nemesis could have been done with more enthusiasm and originality.  Like I said, with that Geek-Critical fanbase, not everyone was going to be happy with the end results.  It seemed to me that the makers of the film didn't try very hard to please anyone at all.

Dig It!",1176508800,3,2554,4.547252747252747
1463299,3,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis killed off the movie series, and on a second viewing it's not hard to see why. While it's not quite as bad as its detractors claim, it suffers from a terrible screenplay by John Logan that never manages to integrate characterization into the action, leaving most of it to be found in the DVD's deleted scenes bin, while slogging through an incredibly undernourished but tediously dragged out and dull story that has one good but barely utilized idea in having as its villain a younger clone of the Enterprise's captain. How did they manage it? They must have got a hair off the bald captain's comb is the main theory offered (this may be a joke, but judging from how crude the comedy is elsewhere that's doubtful). Why did they do it? Part of an elaborate conspiracy they, er, gave up on years ago. But he's got a plan to make the Romulan Empire great again, of course. Probably. Quite what his nefarious plot to destroy the Federation is is never really explained so there's not much in the way of threat - especially since the villain only has one spaceship and quickly loses his allies because he keeps wasting time playing mind games or committing the odd psychic rape rather than getting down to delivering the conquest and pillage he promised. Oh, and he needs Captain Picard's DNA to stop himself prematurely self-destructing. Only, on second thoughts, he decides not to bother and to do something else instead. Quite what isn't exactly clear, but it involves filling much of the last third of the movie with a desperately unexciting space battle against a dull green background before yet another of the regular TV cast makes the ultimate sacrifice. Unfortunately this time round there is absolutely no reason for him to do so, and this being Star Trek where no popular character is allowed to stay dead (it even took two death scenes to kill off Captain Kirk in Generations) the ending is yet another copout. Koboyashi Maru indeed...

A clumsy and half-hearted rehash of The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, this voyage is clearly one for the money, with the regulars topping up their pension funds big time and the guest stars getting screwed. Even Ron Perlman makes no impression whatsoever in what looks like a cheap Halloween Skeletor mask (easily the worst makeup job in Star Trek history, and that includes the green chick and the plastic lizard guy in the 60s TV show). Still, you can have a few cheap laughs at the expense of the distinctly unthreatening Tom Hardy and the gleeful sadism of casting someone who can't pronounce his `r's as a Reman who has usurped control of the Romulan Empire, leading to lines like ""Womulans feel thweatened by Wemen upstawts"" or ""We will no longer bow befawr anyone as slaves. Not the Womulans and not your mighty Fedewation. We are a wace bwed for waw... and conqwest"" - at times it's like listening to Biggus Dickus addressing the crowd in Monty Python's Life of Brian. The usually reliable Stuart Baird, wearing his directing hat, can do nothing to liven things up, and even the great Jerry Goldsmith's score is distinctly professional but workmanlike. Incredibly dull stuff.

The extras package on the 2-disc set at least is impressive, carrying over all the extras from the one-disc release and adding to them comprehensively with additional added scenes and more featurettes than you could possibly want - even the Easter egg featurettes are a decent length for once. If only they graced a better film...",1176336000,2,3492,4.7893864013267

This movie takes you away because of the richness of the soulful crew, the story development, the action, the computer aided strategies (with user-friendly interfaces), the really mean villains, the thrilling classical music, the passionate romances, the stimulating science jargon and the symphony of all those things put together. This movie has the elements that kept me hooked. I prefer this film to all other Star Trek Movies (Yes. Including the ones with Shatner & Nimoy.)

The role Data has in this is great and the picard/clone relationship was good. Riker and Troi have their moment and we even get a Janeway, Wesley, Guinan appearance. Might have liked one more space battle but, the last one was very impressive and the general end was impressive and wasnt' expecting it to happen the way it did. In general it just showed me why the TNG was so great. Even in the interaction between the crew is vintage STar trek TNG.

The only downside is that Worf one of my favs didnt' have a big role but, for the price here it's a must buy",1172102400,3,714,4.25
1463304,3,B00005JLRT,"Chances are, if you are buying this movie, you have already formed an opinion on it by now. As the reviews suggest, it is not an outright success story, but it has to be said it does miss the mark on a lot too.

This re-release as a special edition gives a chance to re-evaluate what seems like it will be the last in the Next Generation movies. In viewing again, long after the excitement of a new Trek movie has passed, and the disappointment of something less than was hoped for or hyped has faded, Nemesis turns out to be not such a bad movie after all. The plot revolves around the Romulan Empire, specifically its new leader who has taken power with the Remans, previously the dominated race. This new leader, Schinzon, turns out to be Picards clone, and when Schinzon summons Picard and the Enterprise, the question is - what are his motives. Well, predictably after a period of cautious circling and meaning infused dinners, the motives turn out to be domination and destruction, and our heroes have to save the day - however, along the way the writer (John Logan, also writer of Gladiator) infuses much subtext of families and the dilemna of facing the evil within yourself, and aspiring to become something better - very much the stuff of Trek.

For the movie, the writing is not bad, the effects fantastic, and this version boasts a wonderful dts mix as well as 5.1. However, as comfortable as the leads are in their roles, and Tom Hardy fills out his part well also, there is a nagging feeling of tiredness about it all. It's refreshing to see the characters move on - one of the excellent deleted scenes has Picard discuss with data the passage of time marked by occasions such as weddings and funerals, not just without but within too, and it's this sort of character growth that helped inject so much humanity into the classic trek characters - shame they cut that scene. However, the attempt to find a 'personal' villain for Picard does not hit the mark - we never do feel that passionately involved, as the characater is so completely new to us. How much more resonant it might have been if the character was from Picards past, and featured in the TV series, such as Khan was for Kirk.

If you already have the movie and are debating whether to get it for the extras, I can only say - do it. The second disc is heaving with extras on all subjects possible. The deleted scenes last almost 30 minutes, and almost all genuinely add something. One can understand the need to trim a movie down, but honestly it feels like this could have been a richer movie with some of these scenes intact. The production, the music, the director, all are featured with extensive interviews. There are two commentaries on the disc, plus one text commentary - if you think you can really watch the movie that often! While mostly interesting, the extras do show less honest heart-searching on the end result, as it does sound like PR plurb, but that's a minor quibble.

In short, for a Trek movie this would not be a first choice, but well worth buying to complete the Star trek movie experience. As a special edition, this is well worth it for the extras on display. 7/10",1171411200,4,3167,4.521815008726003
1463382,5,B00005JLRT,"I just don't get it.  Why are some people bashing this film?  Now I will be the first to admit that The Wrath of Khan is my favorite but Nemisis comes in a close second to The Undiscovered Contry.  Star Trek was born the year I was 1966 and ever since I watched my first episode I have been hooked.

Anyway I will be the first to admit that this film isn't without it's holes.  Like why did Shinzon hate the Federation so much?  He was cloned by the Romulans the Federation had nothing to do with his creation or putting him in the mines.  Why were the Warbirds dispatched so easily? just to mention a few.  But their is so much more to be happy about.

The acting was great and the director wasn't bad either.  The battle scenes were great, casue we all know that Paramount is known to be cheap.  Take for instance the battle scene in The undiscovered Country when the Klingon Bird of Prey explodes.....well this explosion scenes is put into Generations when the Klingon bird of Prey explodes.  Did you notice?  Anyway in most Star Trek movies when a explosion happens on the ship the actors just move around and shake thier chairs like they are being pushed around, in Nemesis they actually put the bridge on hydrolics so the bridge is moved around making the battle scenes look more realistic giving the actors one less thing to have to remember.  Some people take offence to Riker taking another ship to command when he said he wanted to command the Enterprise.  Well, when was the last time you changed your mind?  People change in life and this reflects that.  We may not know the reasons why but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of things so don't be so critical, take it for what it is....A movie with 40 years of history to keep in mind when they create a movie, this has to be a daunting task.

Anyway the movie is great and in my mind still holds true to the addage that, ""Even numbered Trek films don't suck""  This movie has so much, it sheds light on the main characters in the movie and it has action, the  Starship battle, a love story, the marriage of Troy and Riker, loss, the death of Data, Humor, Worf with a hang over.  If people were this critical over Generations I think it would be justified and I liked Generations.  But not this movie if you haven't purchased it, do it you will like it.

But this movie is simply unacceptable.

Stylisticly, it differs tremendously from the tone of the Next Generation series.  And let me just go on record as saying, I am SO tired of seeing the cast brandishing phaser rifles.  I realize the filmmakers wanted to make a film that catered to a broader audience, rather than to merely trekkers, but in so trying, what they actually did was create a movie that is appealing to neither.

I would also like to know why Jonathan Frakes wasn't allowed to direct this movie.  He directed First Contact spectacularly and even managed to make the inferior Insurrection work.  He clearly has an intuition for why people enjoy watching the Next Generation cast and what they expect to see in a Star Trek film.

1463388,4,B00005JLRT,"I missed ""Nemesis"" when it hit theaters a few years back.  I was never a huge ""Star Trek"" fan, but I always enjoyed watching the films.  I especially enjoyed the original casts' flicks.  TNG, although good, just wasn't the same as the original cast.  With that said, I expected ""Nemesis"" to be a flounder due to the negative lashing it received not only from movie critics, but Trek fans as well.  I can see where loyal fans of the series could be upset with this film.  First of all, it has a heavy leaning towards action.  I always felt that TNG was quicker to try peace talks instead of phasers to solve a problem.  Secondly, fan favorites such as Riker, Worf, and Geordi were given the second-tier treatment in order for the focus to be placed firmly on Picard.  Even Data, though he has a crucial role in this film, doesn't get to really shine until the movie is about halfway to completion.

The story, in my opinion, was wonderful.  **SPOILERS** A Romulan project gone bad, Shinzon (Tom Hardy), overthrows the Romulan Senate and almost single-handedly destroys the Federation by utilizing the warrior race Remens.  He also plays with the Remens' emotions by using the prejudices of the Romulans toward them as a weapon.  Not to mention the fact that this guy is a clone of Picard.  That alone makes for wonderful mind games between the pair.  Shinzon uses Picards mind and heart against him, trapping him with B-4, a prototype of Data, and then playing to his heart by telling him about the cruelties he suffered as a Romulan slave.  I actually felt a little sorry for Shinzon even though I knew he was the big baddie from the beginning.

This movie plays well to a general sci-fi audience.  Hardcore TNG fans will definitely find a lot wrong with this film.  When all is said and done, however, we get a nice space action yarn that will appeal to most people in the long run.

The DVD is very nice.  It comes with a plethora of special features, broken down into movie, Federation, and Romulan sections.  It's a nice edition to any sci-fi fan's DVD library and a necessity to any ""Star Trek"" completionist.",1165708800,2,2114,4.581333333333333
1463389,4,B00005JLRT,"Opening with an assassination of Romulans at the Romulan Senate shows this to be more exciting than its predecessor ""Insurrection"". Nemesis is an underrated film that only recently has gained the respect it deserved all along. I always felt that this film had a good sense of balance between humor (Data singing ""Blue Skies"" and Worf objecting to being nude at the Betazed wedding), action (the dune buggy scene and the Enterprise ramming into the Scimitar for example), and drama (the tragic end of the film).

The story of Nemesis has always interested me, in a way, both Data and Picard have met there twins, one being good, one being evil. The villain Shinzon is very interesting and worthy opponent for Picard see he is he. No one can beat you at your own game better than yourself. B4 had a child quality that I had sympathy for. Never understanding what was going on, only doing what he was told, not intentionally bad. So I feel for his character. Both Shinzon and B4 force us to ask the question of what our lives would have been like if things had been different.

Two parts of the film really stick out in my mind that make this film excellent, mainly dealing with the ramming of the Enterprise into the great Scimitar ship, a very dramatic scene that was pulled off perfectly. The Reman ship the Scimitar is quite impressive and proves most formidable to the Enterprise. Another scene that caught my attention was when Troi probed into the Viceroy's mind to discover the location of the Scimitar, well done! Of course, seeing Admiral Janeway was a thrill for me since I loved the TV series Voyager. It is nice to see her character at such a great position.

Nemesis had some of the best acting I have seen out of the TNG crew, and I love TNG. When Riker is fighting the Viceroy in the last battle between the two, you can literally see the fear in Riker's at not knowing where the enemy was hiding. The chemistry between Picard and Shinzon was electric; you can feel the hostility just by watching the two peer into each others eyes.

And yes, this is the tragic film in which this is the death of Data, a very quite moment with the only words spoken being ""Good Bye"". This is indeed a sad scene, not so much of his death, but his memorial service when they are discussing Data even now brings tears to my eyes. But there is comfort that B4 at least has some of Data left in him.

Overall, this is a great film which is finally getting praise by fans for being so. Only the future will tell if this becomes even more popular than it is, and I believe it will. As I watched Picard leave his office and stride down the hall for what could be the last time we see, I realized something, if this is indeed the last TNG movie, it was definitely a good high class film to go out on.",1165449600,3,2788,4.384912959381045
1463390,5,B00005JLRT,"Well, let me start by acknowledging that this movie was not well received by the fandom and to state that I've been a fan since the early 70's so, I am qualified to express my opinion and this is that: ST:Nemesis is a very good  movie.

Spoilers ahead. For me this movie is special because it's the farewell to the cast of the ST: The Next Generation crew, it's their last movie and we have to mourn the death of Data too, but at the same time there is the promise of the survival of his personality thru the memory download to his 'brother' B-4. Thus, the sadness that one feels, immediately transforms into optimism when B-4 begins to hum the song that Data sang at the wedding of 'Mrs & Mr Troi' and then as the camera does a scanning shoot of the Enterprise-E in the space-dock and we listen to the Star Trek Fanfare, excitement takes you and, you applaud, at least this is what I did when I watched the movie in the movie theater.

I want to mention that the female Romulan captain results noteworthy, you first obtain the impression that she is just another weakling underling, but she is a strong woman and she has morale, that's why she alerts the Romulans of the error that they are about to do via the actions of Shinzon, and then she takes two Birds of Prey to go after Shinzon, and tries to stop him from using the 'Scimitar' against the Earth. I would have liked to see them both, Picard and she, having their toast. I liked this female Romulan.

Do not let the negative critics influence you, ST:Nemesis is highly enjoyable.",1162425600,3,1538,4.3671328671328675
1463391,1,B00005JLRT,"Hello everybody,

First, bravo N.Stock for stating exactly what's on my mind, but I need to put my own version as well: After watching that picture, I felt physically hurt as Star Trek fan.

Thank you producers for making this movie. Thank you for still being able to regroup every member of the cast for this cause (after the series' end in 1994 (!)). I have great respect for all the work you did to have this movie done. To me, you did mess up big time though while making it:

Beware of spoilers!

- How come Deanna & Will marry after just a little adrenaline-induced making out in previous ""Insurrection?"" Doesn't fit with seven years of ""not while we're on the same ship...""-talk.

- Another Data-type android is found...again! 2nd and counting...

- The car chase was cool but nah, too old for Star Trek. (Bad lightning by the way, phaser shots almost weren't seen.)

- Shinzon & co appear way too ""We're gonna be the bad guys"" during their first scene.

- I get the clone part but why must there be a Deanna rape? Only to explain her accessing the villain's mind during the final battle?

- Romulans are there but not there.

- Silly chanceless space battle. It's the Enterprise for God's sake! I'm tired of seeing that ship in every movie either understaffed, under shielded, unprepared or under armed!

- Enterprise almost self-destructed (again).

- Data dies without ""downloading"" his katra and leaves a silly replica. Bad ending!

- Whole flick is about Picard & Data. Again!

As long as the story sucks, I don't care about up-to-date special effects, I don't care that the bridge is built on actual shaking surfaces and it doesn't matter to me how many millions of $ were involved in making that project. Granted, maybe I find some things silly because I didn't understand them but it's just my opinion.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing young Kirk & Spock in the next film and hope that really well fitting actors will be found for these characters... Cheers!",1159574400,19,1979,4.630372492836676

Giving his life was the ultimate sacrifice and was the point (to me) where he really became human. He gave his life for his fellow man which is the greatest thing anyone can do.

1463473,5,B00005JLRT,"In 2002, Paramount Pictures decided to try their hand at redeeming themselves in the eyes of `Trekkies' after the somewhat dismal performance of their previous endeavor ""Star Trek:  Insurrection"".  Though I personally enjoyed `Insurrection', many hardcore fans despised the movie, citing it as being too romantic and humorous and way too light on the action.  So, with that response to their previous installment, Paramount wanted to make the next movie be much darker, more action-packed, and featuring an even more intense storyline than previous films.  For the previous two films, Paramount was happy with actor Jonathan Frakes filling the role of director as well, especially with his extremely entertaining and successful effort with ""Star Trek:  First Contact"", but with the somewhat lesser performance of ""Star Trek:  Insurrection"", the executives at Paramount felt it would be safer to go with a fresh perspective to direct the newest film.  Enter renowned film editor Stuart Baird, whose talent for finding the perfect blend of action and drama has served him well throughout his career in film, and Paramount felt it was time to give this long-time editor the chance to put his skills directly behind the camera.  Would this choice prove to be a wise one, or merely another nail in the coffin for this slowly dwindling franchise, only time would tell.

""Star Trek:  Nemesis"" begins on a joyous note, with the wedding of Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis).  On this wonderful day even more good news arrives when Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives word that the Romulans want peace, and that the crew of the Enterprise-E are to be the emissaries of the Federation.  Just as the Enterprise makes its way towards the Romulan Empire, a brilliant villain named Shinzon awaits them, harboring an evil plan of destruction for the Federation, and a dark secret linking him and Picard.

Prior to the release of this 10th film in the long-running `Star Trek' movie franchise, I felt that ""Star Trek:  First Contact"" was probably the best `Star Trek' movie made; however, after viewing ""Star Trek:  Nemesis"", I believe a new best of `Trek' movie has been named.  The hardcore fans of the franchise, or `Trekkies' as they prefer to be called, who were less than thrilled with `Insurrection', were without a doubt unbelievably impressed with `Nemesis'.  Even though ""Star Trek:  Nemesis"" was by far one of the best `Star Trek' films ever made, it sadly didn't do too well at the box office.  This was caused by the poor reception to ""Star Trek:  Insurrection"" and that the current TV series ""Star Trek:  Enterprise"" was receiving poor ratings, so support for the franchise was at an all-time low.  I also believe a big problem the `Star Trek' franchise faced, and the result was evident for this movie, was that the market had been oversaturated with the series, because pretty much for the last 20 to 30 years there has always been some form of `Star Trek' that could be seen either on TV or in theaters.  Perhaps, if more time had gone by between the release of `Insurrection' and the release of `Nemesis', the latter would have fared better at the box office, but now we'll never know for sure.

The acting, as always in these movies, was top-notch due to the cast being so familiar with their characters that they all are second nature to them.  The director, Stuart Baird, a newcomer to the `Star Trek' franchise, did an excellent job helming this film, and delivered a high-octane thrill ride that delivered on so many levels.  All of the special effects in the movie were outstanding, and by far the best in the entire series, which added to the overall greatness of this movie.  Without a doubt, this movie should have done much better at the box office, and it's a shame it didn't because it truly is the best in the series, and is one `Star Trek' film that should not be missed!

1463476,3,B00005JLRT,"Let me make one thing clear: If you plan to buy this movie, get this version.  The added scenes occasionally offer a glimpse of how they might have made this movie better, if nothing else.

Frankly Nemesis is a movie that worked a lot better when seen on a massive screen in the theaters.  It's got what is easily the best and most intense starship battle scene of the TNG movies, and for the first time shows off just how amazingly powerful starships really are.

Unfortunately, this was the high point of the movie.  Most of the movie's plot and dialog could be described as a loosely strung-together batch of obscure continuity references and lines borrowed from the television series.  All the character development that they did with Worf on DS9 and Data in the movies seems to have been conveniently forgotten in order to try to capture the feel of the TV show.  It hardly does this very well, though, because the main story is hampered by a series of almost embarrasingly fan-boyish action sequences.

The other dissapointment was the fact that this movie was supposed to be the one where we finally learn more about the Romulans.  Unfortunatley we are shown absolutely nothing new, as the story is entirely focussed on the new race, the Remans, who have apparently been slaves and front-line troops for the Romulans for millenia.  One can hardly fault the writer for taking this easier way out - the Romulans have never been given enough in depth attention for us to learn that much about their culture - but it's dissapointing to see this missed opportunity.

Despite the flaws, however, there are some moments where the show really starts to shine through.  The first conversations between Shinzon and Picard are interesting and thought provoking, as is the underlying theme, but both of these seem to have been shelved to allow more time for the final battle. The result is a lot of fascinating build up to something that is never properly resolved.",1148947200,2,1960,4.766272189349112

The film certainly lacked something, most of the time i felt i was watching a remake of the brilliant 'Wrath of Khan' but without the great story, William Shatner and the superb Ricardo Montalban as Khan. Im not saying this is a bad movie, it's certainly alot better than the dismal 'Generations' and the embarrasing 'Insurrection', what im saying is that this should have been better considering it's the last Next Generation big screen outing. The are some great moments in the film however such as the epic face-off between the Enterprise E and Shinzons ship and the wedding scene has some good humour (Despite an appearence by Westley Crusher). Overall im not sure about this one, on the one hand it's a good solid Star Trek film, but on the other hand it feels like a half arsed remake of 'The Wrath of Khan' and it's not even close to been as good as that film. Judge for your self and give it a try.",1145750400,,1074,4.375
1463478,4,B00005JLRT,"I have only just seen this movie, partly because I began to lose interest after Insurrection, and partly because of the overall negative reviews.

However, Nemesis is certainly worth watching, even if it is a little formulaic; although there are a number of questionables, many of which have been pointed out by other fans.

For me, the recurring idiocy is the idea of being defenseless against a cloaked ship. Hello, the second the ship fired, even a modern-day military computer and radar system could pinpoint the exact source of the shot, and provide counterattack coordinates to the ship under fire. Even if you can't see the ship, you can see the point of emanation.

As for using up all of the photon torpedoes in a single relatively brief engagement; as another fan pointed out, this is simply ridiculous.

Please watch the movie and make up your own mind. It's better than Insurrection, but not a 'great' movie, like First Contact or any of the Classic Trek epics.

There's certainly the possibility of a sequel built into the ending, but after the disappointing box office for Nemesis, they will need to be very sure they have a winner before they put anything else together. Especially since the sequel would be an odd-numbered movie...",1145750400,2,1247,4.863207547169812
1463479,2,B00005JLRT,"The story behind this movie isn't at all bad. It's just executed in an extraordinary bad manner. First, this may be a loyal star trek fans paranoia or did the turbo lift doors and other sets not have the crisp sounds when they open or close like in previous movies? If the crew can't get the turbo lift doors right then how can they get the more important parts of the movie right? Also, when the scene where Captain Picard receives the orders to proceed into Romulan space from Admiral Janeway and the Enterprise goes to warp on his orders have any energy? I didn't think that it did and it's a crucial scene to get a star trek audience into a film. Star Trek: Generations had the intense plot building scene in Stellar Cartography with Picard and data, Star Trek: First Contact contained the scene where the Enterprise warped to Earth to encounter the borg, and Star Trek: Insurrection even had scenes that built the excitement with the plot with the Enterprise traveling to the briar patch and through the briar patch. One thing that I believe these scenes shared was that they got the audience pumped for the primary development of the plot. This corresponding scene in Star Trek: Nemesis left you feeling cold and uninterested.

In addition, even though there was a barrage of weapons fire exchanged in the Enterprise and between the Enterprise and the Scimatar you didn't even get the feeling that the fight is a legitimate one because of the sheer size of the scimatar and its defense capabilities. The whole battle has no point when Cmdr. Laforge informs the bridge that the Scimatar shields are at 70 percent even though the Enterprise ""supposely"" emptied the contents of its torpedo launchers on it. This film doesn't grab you and say ""Hey, this is some serious stuff"" even though the potential of that occurance is technically in the film. This is also frustrating because there will not be another ST: TNG film even there were talks of one only a few months ago. Having a leading actor such as Patrick Stewart at an age of 65  shortened the life span of the trek franchise. Frankly, Stuart Baird's performance as the director on Nemesis wasn't anything to write home about and he didn't believe in the theme behind Star Trek that Gene Roddenberry created.",1145664000,2,2267,4.693467336683417

1) Data's newfound brother, B-4. Another brother? And why is everybody surprised he looks like Data? Remember Lore? Anybody?

2) The story, for the fourth (and final?) time, concentrates almost exclusively on Picard & Data. Again. There are other characters, you know?

3) Too few Romulans.

4) Worf is chief of security again? When we last saw him on DS-9, he was appointed ambassador to the Klingon empire. What happened? Did he get bored?

5) Wesley Crusher. While it's good to see him again, why does he have no dialogue? And why is he in a starfleet uniform? He quit Sarfleet years ago.

6) Too few supporting characters. Where's Chief O'Brien? Q? Dr. Pulaski? Worf's son, Alexander? Mrs. Troi? Sure we get Guinan & a brief appearance from ADMIRAL Janeway, but they're too brief.

7) Picard's ""evil"" clone. Yawn. And as a side note, in a photo we see a young Picard with no hair. Huh? We've seen young Picard before and he did have hair.

8) Too much violence and not enough space exploration. That is what Star Trek is all about. Not explosions. We need a story like Star Trek: The Motion Picture (only not as boring).

9) Remember when Worf & Troi were an item? Well, apparently the writers forgot, because it's never mentioned here.

10) Not enough LaForge & Dr. Crusher. They both get screwed royally. Gates McFadden should also kick Rick Berman's ass.

Now for the good stuff. Yes there are a couple of good things here.

1) Data's death. While it's never ""fun"" to see a main character die, it does make for a very moving moment. Data finally makes the ultimate sacrifice. He saves his friends. That's what makes him more human.

2) Troi & Riker get married.

3) Riker kicks the viceroy's ass. (Too bad it wasn't Berman's.)

4) And for the second time, Troi gets to wreck the Enterprise. This time by ramming it into the Scimitar. Yahoo!

Troi gets to use her mental powers for like the first time since the series ended and Guinan (and Wesley via special edition) comes back one more time.

Some say the supporting cast (Riker, LaForge, Beverly) didn't have a big enough role, but most original films (except maybe the classics 4 and 6) gave Scotty, Chekov, Sulu and Uhura just a few lines, typically centering around the frienship between Kirk, Spock and McCoy as well as these center around Picard and Data.

1463576,3,B00005JLRT,"The longest in production, the lowest grossing and most limbo-bound Star Trek movie of all. Nemesis is neither here nor there. It entertains without satisfying and features loads of brilliant SFX, but little awe. Perhaps we are all just too familiar with franchise and it needs to forever be increasingly far-reaching to keep it fresh.

However, it IS a lot better than Insurrection. In terms of direction anyway. Jonothan Frake's TV movie approach to the franchise lacked any sort of class or sophistication but Stuart Baird fixes that with a darker and more menacing tone. The script is more sinister than that of Insurrection or First Contact (the Next Gen movie titles still remain uninspired) but what ends up in the film is confused and undefined.

The plot has Picard sent out to Romulous to help make peace with the new Preator, a man who calls himself Shinzon and who happens to be an exact clone of Picard. Data finds an android identical to himself buried in the sand of a nearby desert planet. Picard and Data are suspicious of their radical finds and the suspicion soon proves to be justified as treachery and double-crosses are revealed.

With an unconfirmed amount of deleted scenes (rumors put it around the 50 minute mark) it's painfully obvious that important plot developments have been cut out of the film. The sense of the Enterprise emptying as all the main characters leave for new career paths is lost. Worf and Crusher are hardly featured for some reason. The relationship between Data and his long-lost brother B-4 seems very thin. The sub-text is muddled and hard to get to grips with. And a sub-plot involving Praetor Shinzon's lust (and subsequent repeated rape) for Deanna Troi is abandoned as soon as it starts. What was the point of starting it in the first place? Is B-4 actually Data's evil brother Lore?

And despite the fact that Star Trek has been around for almost 40 years at this point, the STILL do the cheap 'desert outside of LA as some other planet' trick. And the dune buggies seemed to be kind of out of place. Like it was just added in at the last minute to make the film more exciting.

Shinzon is not the slightest bit scary and even looks like the 3rd place runner-up in a Right Said Fred lookalike competition. For all the talk of him looking slightly different from Picard due to his life of hardship, he didn't look very hard.

Also, Jerry Goldsmith's score just seems like loads of his previous scores with some cues altered slightly. Honestly, I recognised several cues from Executive Decision, Gremlins 2, The 'Burbs and many other movies changed just a little bit to make it sound different. Though I understand Goldsmith was very ill at this point so I can forgive him for that.

But it's hard to forgive the rest of the film. Like I said, it's entertaining, but falls apart under even the most superficial of scrutiny. It could have been handled a lot better and I'm surprised and disappointed that Paramount fumbled their flagship series so badly.

The DVD features a perfect 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and brilliant Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. There are loads of extras but Paramount fumbles again by not including an extended cut of the film. It's like they just don't care!",1137283200,3,3228,4.741532976827094

Frakes and Sirtis don't get the amount of airtime they deserved. Likewise, Michael Dorn's Worf didn't get the amount of attention he deserved as well. The Clone, as another reviewer stated accurately, doesn't even look anything like Patrick Stewart's Picard?? Plus, I WANTED TO FINALLY SEE THE ROMULANS ON THE BIG SCREEN AND WHAT DID I GET? REMANS!? While they were pretty cool and innovative, we really didn't get any Romulans?

This movie didn't resolve much for me. The Data death was unneccesary and despressing given that he has fought to become human through all those seasons and is a much beloved character that gets blown-up. That's it? And the whole B-4 thing? Yeesh. This movie is ""ok"" but so far below par for the Trek folks, it's a bit sad to see that the ORIGINAL TREK films had so much success with Wrath of Kahn, Voyage Home (the whales), and ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" and then each TNG movie was a flop.....I almost with TNG would come out with another movie just to make things right!!

I have watched every Star Trek movie and think this one is the second-to-worst one ever (the worst being Insurrection).  I was anxiously awaiting it's release.  However, upon seeing it, I wished I could erase it from memory.  Although it started off with more of a plot than some of the past films in the series, it quickly unravels into a sci-fi mess.  I kept thinking there were so many ways they could have enhanced the plot or even given the movie goers a surprise twist of an ending (especially with Picard's clone!) but it was boringly predictable.  I was also upset that a regular character was going to be killed off.  Riker gets married at the beginning of the film and then finds himself in dangerous situations throughout much of the rest of the story so you are start to believe that he will be the one to bite the dust.  He's not. That is the only ""twist"" in the entire film.  Add to that the fact that this film is very dark - literally.  Lots of shots in dark rooms, underground spaces, dimly lit space craft, etc. and it feels gloomy.  At least with most of the other Trek films there was always a sense of hope at the end of the movies.  Not so with this one.",1134518400,2,1257,4.347639484978541

There is also a lot of character development. There's also a lot of mythology included, especially in regards to B-4 from TNG episode, ""Inheritance."" I only wish they would have expanded the Romulan mythology more, by adding Tomalok or Sela or even Spock to the movie.

1463651,4,B00005JLRT,"This is the latest movie from the Star Trek TNG series. The interesting thing about it is that the director was not a ""trekkie"".

He was not familiar with the previous episodes of Star Trek TNG,

so he brought his own approach to the movie.

Of course, this film has all the features that make up a normal Star Trek movie: space travel, lots of action, shootings...

It has a funny scene in the begining, where Will Riker is is getting married to Deanna Troi. Lieutenant commander Data gets the chance to sing a jazz song by Irving Berlin:

""Never saw the sun shining so bright,

 Never saw things going so right.

 Noticing the days hurrying by...

 When you are in love, my how they fly...""

I really like that song, because it is so optimistic.

Unfortunately, there are some elements of a horror movie.

There is some virus that springs out from a sphere, goes up to the ceiling

and then falls down and poisons a room full of people. Their faces become

ugly as hell. Later, some ugly faces with almost vampire-like teeth appear

again. And Deanna Troi has nightmares, in which her husband Will Riker

is getting replaced with one of those faces.

The saddest thing is that at the end of this movie,

Data dies in a starship explosion. He dies without even saying anything,

or without making an effort to save himself. What is left afterwards

is his brother B4 (""before""). But unfortunately B4 is a prototype - an earlier model - and he is not as smart as Data.

Nevertheless, I recommend this movie. I can keep talking a lot about the other interesting characters - Praetor Shinzon, etc. But it is better if you see the movie for yourself. Just remember to close your eyes when the ugly faces show up. Otherwise, the movie's colors and special effects are spectacular. If you watch it on DVD (not on VHS) and on a brand-new latop (like I did), the experience is out of this world. It feels as if you are in space together with the crew of the Enterprise.",1132790400,,1962,4.449438202247191

Keep this in mind when you watch this movie and see how many different ways the Nemesis theme comes across or carried through. The Nemesis theme is almost overwhelming from the start but if we pay attention one can find beleifs and values that transcend all adversity providing hope for the future. This movie does not attempt to do more than what a movie is capable of providing.

Movies are comprised of 5 stars. Have them all and you have a 5 star movie.

1)Does the movie tell story?

2)Is the story easy to follow within the movie?

3)Was the director effective in telling of this story?

4)Did the movie accomplish this in the allotted time frame?

5)Did the audience leave the movie talking about the story they just experinced? If the answer is 'yes' to all 5 of these ?'s - the Movie is 5 STAR.

Nemesis is five star becouse it accomplishes all of these things.

Word of Caution: If you have your ""cool"" card in your wallet...this movie is sure to disappoint and if you are expecting this movie to be anything like the televison series, again it will sadly disappoint. Now, if we take out the cool cards, view with minds open - Nemesis is complex, exciting, and has all the elements of the previous nine Trek big screen releases plus the movie-making technology of today. If we look back to the previous movies they also had little in common with the TV series other than the familiar names and faces along with Star Fleet terminology. A well-done movie provides entertainment value regardless of prior exposure to the subject matter.

Try the other way around. This is undoubtedly the most difficult Star Trek film I have ever tried to watch. I've attempted to sit through it three times in the hope that maybe a shimmer of good would come through for me...alas, it is not to be I'm afraid. Everything ""N. Stock"" said is 100% true and on the money. This is, in my opinion, the worst of the entire series of films, O.S. and TNG combined. Most people seem to agree that Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was the worst, but at least there's a sense of adventure which is sadly lacking in Nemesis. Star Trek V also had, in my opinion, some of the richest character interaction between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a joy to listen to as always. Sadly, that is the only thing Nemesis has going for it. The characters aren't even fun to watch. These characters we had come to enjoy watching on ST:TNG are cardboard cutouts of their television selves. Rick Berman is either trying to save face or he's living in denial. I think it's time Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens took over the reins of the Star Trek franchise. It's a shame Enterprise was canceled just when it was actually getting interesting with them as writers, producers and story editors. Season 4 of that series is what season 1 should have been. But, I'm straying off subject...Nemesis is without a doubt my least favorite of all 10 films and in my opinion, the absolute worst of the lot.",1130457600,10,1598,4.4573378839590445
1463753,3,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis is far from a perfect film.  We've still got Wacky Picard, Action Hero and another gratuitous scene of Data singing, two constant blights on the TNG film franchise.  We're asked to accept that Remus is not, in fact, inhabited by Romulans, but evil devil goblins we've never heard of before, and that Shinzon wants to destroy Earth for no discernable reason.  And yeah, the movie ""borrows"" many of its best parts from The Wrath of Khan.  But you know what?  It's *still* the best TNG film.  Generations captured the spirit of TNG as it was on TV, but had a terribly lame rehashed storyline.  First Contact was marginally better, but still owed much of its storyline to old Trek episodes and jettisoned everything that made TNG what it was, turning Picard into a weak Kirk analogue and Data into Spock, Jr. while sublimating the rest of the cast.  We shall not speak of Insurrection.  Nemesis, in spite of its obvious weaknesses, mostly gets the characters right and resurrects several characters (Guinan, Spot, Wesley Crusher) and character dynamics (Geordi and Data as friends) that haven't been seen since TNG ended its TV run and made its inaugural voyage to the big screen in 1994.  The plot is somewhat rehashed and occasionally cryptic, but it's not aggressively bad the way Insurrection's was, nor as obviously recycled as Generations and First Contact were.

If you're looking for a real two-hour epic featuring the Star Trek:  The Next Generation crew, I suggest you seek out The Best of Both Worlds 1&2 or All Good Things...  But if you're just looking for a minor diversion with some old friends, you really can't go wrong with this film, IMO.

Now, I loved this film when I first saw it in theaters, before I was a very big fan of Star Trek, but now, after three years, I viewed it again after purchasing the Collector's Edition. Now that I have seen all of the other movies, and plenty of episodes of TOS, TNG, and DS9, I have to judge this installment as inferior.

The action in Nemesis is enough to placate non-fans, but the film lacks much substance. The underlying message is not pronounced well enough, dropped in favor of unnecessary action sequences, which also caused the film's creators to cut many scenes, with Rick Berman insisting basically that it was for the best.

There are some inconsistencies with previously-established canon and there are some things that are just ""out there"". In the finale of Deep Space Nine, we learn Worf is going to become the Klingon ambassador to the Federation, but here he is, becoming a member of the crew. Janeway we find has been promoted thrice in about two years. No mention is made of Data's original brother Lore. The Argo seems created specifically for a chase scene. The emergency transporter device...right.

This is a movie, they can't make talk fests out of them and expect them to be good.

The Captan seemed out of character too, what was the deal with him being so happy in the beginning? And Data, boring, he ceased to be interesting when half the movie was about him and him! Then you had Picard and Picard why didn't the writers think to bring in Will and Will?

All in all a very lousy movie. I thought the last one was bad but this one was really bad.

1463756,4,B00005JLRT,"I saw Nemesis 3 times opening day and hadn't seen it since until I watched it again today. And I must say it is a fine Star Trek movie, however it is not perfect.

First the good. The anti-Picard Picard or Shinzon is an interesting premise of a character. I do feel that his character is initially interesting...the first few chats with Picard are good. However, when the action picks up between the Scimitar and The Enterprise E I feel their dialogue becomes stale, as well as the movie. This big battle easily could have been edited down. It seemed the Enterprise E was at 10% shields 10 seconds into the fight, yet the fight lasts for 30 minutes!!! They should have taken out some of the fighting and put in some of the great deleted scenes in this package. Mainly the Data and Picard talk, the Wesley scene(apparently he is serving on the Titan...who would have known?) and a couple of others that seemed like they would have fit nicely...especially the last one where we get to meet a new member of Captain Picard's crew. A much better way to end the movie with his last line.

I haven't looked over many of the other special features but I'm sure they're informative and well put together like those on the other special editions.

Of course, I have a few gripes with the movie. The whole rape thing was pretty rediculous and pointless...nothing is really followed up on that or even why its happening. Then there's the whole ending where everyone could have lived if Picard just listened instead of ignoring one of his crew members comments. Very unPicard and just bad writing. Then there's stuff involving Romulus that could have been put to good use like what's happening with Spock's reunification efforts?

If this is the last TNG movie...then I do have to say I am disappointed, as I know they could have went out better with some great conflict rather than this more or less good vs. evil cliched storyline. If you liked TNG the show, you'll like Nemesis but it isn't perfect as it definitely leaves you wishing for a more complex problem for the crew to solve.

Hopefully Trek isn't dead. If anyone from Paramount is reading this...I say the best way for TNG to end is Picard/Federation vs. Section 31. The Prime Directive is what the Federation is based upon and that is exactly what is threatened by Section 31...it's the most appropriate way to go out.

1463758,2,B00005JLRT,"You know, for all of their blind loyalty over the years, Star Trek Fans really deserve better then this. 'Nemesis' is probably the pitiful death-kneel of a once-proud franchise that was driven into the ground by a group of people at Paramount (led by Rick Berman) that just have little or no idea what made Star Trek so endearing.

The acting is just terrible. Patrick Stewart just looks like he's going through the motions. I think it's clear that he wants to move on to other things.  Creatively, I think he's visibly bored.  Jonathan Frakes is a TV actor and still hasn't made a comfortable leap to the big screen, and Michael Dorn's Worf has basically become a Klingon stereotype. This brings me to the sad story of Data. First of all, you can't spend almost 16 years playing out the whole Pinocchio storyline with Data. All of those ""I don't understand humanity and yet aspire to be human"" moments have stopped being endearing quite some time ago, now they're just annoying. His big scene at the end of the movie (I'm really trying not to drop any spoilers) was just totally devoid of any kind of emotion (or emotional impact) at all. His dual role as B-4 (get it? ""Before"") is just terrible, clearly done just in case there's a sequel. The rest of the crew make a cameo, but are essentially given absolutely nothing to do.  Buried in the void of this film are also Dina Meyer and Ron Perlman.  You'd honestly never know they were there.

When 'Nemesis' was being made I had a glimmer of hope for the film.  I thought that bringing on director Stuart Baird as a fresh start was a good way to move off of a creative rut I saw the franchise in.  Baird was a long-time understudy of Richard Donner, so I thought, at worst, the film would be exciting.  It didn't work at all though.  One of the reasons that Star Trek works is because of its attention to detail and the ability to respect its own continuity and rules.  'Nemesis', unfortunately, didn't do any of that.

The plot is riddled with conflicts of logic. Shinzon is the double for Picard and explains that ""other then his jaw and nose being broken years ago, they look identical""? What? This guy's face is as smooth as silk! If anyone could have gotten away with that kind of a statement, it should probably have been Picard! Stewart, just be virtue of being older, could very easily have had those injuries in his youth.

How could the Enterprise have rammed a vessel when they had no shields and the opponent's shields were at 70%? Wouldn't the Enterprise have just broken up on the front of the other ship? I also love villains who cart around a Death-star caliber weapon and don't use it. I could actually keep going too; this is just the short list!

So far the Next Generation movies are just 1 for 4 with 'First Contact' being their only redeeming moment. Gene Roddenberry would be turning in his grave if he knew the state his beloved franchise was in right now. I'm actually praying that there isn't an 11th movie. If there is, there had better be a complete, top-to-bottom turnover in its creative team right up to Rick Berman. What they have now is just NOT getting the job done",1128384000,2,3150,4.493870402802101

And that's the truth.

I was expecting this movie to be something more epic, because it indeed had a great theme, and the possibilities for a great and explendid story, and great starships battles and character conflicts. But no, it stayed in a little square, not daring to venture even a little outside of it, and make it bigger, like an all opne conflit between Federation Starships and a fleet on Romulan Warbirds, and who knows, even a little special appearance by Spock.

Even though I really liked the battle scenes, and the conflict between Picard and Shinzon, I think this is one of the weakest Star Trek Movies ever.

1463762,5,B00005JLRT,"I am a little surprised at the hostility towards the film.  For all that it was I found it entertaining enough to get the DVD.

Stuart Baird wanted to take the film in a different direction which he succeeded but I guess for some change is a bad thing.

I would offer that probably the biggest problem was were the movie was going.  Is it an action film or one with an in-depth plot?  It seemed to try to do both and I think that is what caused problems for most people.

One aspect of the film I liked was the introduction of the Remueans.  I also liked the ship used in the film.

People have complained about Shinzon(Tom Hardy) but I kind of liked the character and I think the actor did a decent job at trying to have some of Picards mannerisms.  There is a feeling of a father son issue with the interaction between Picard and his younger clone.  I guess it was an attempt to ""humanize"" Picard by giving him nurture feelings as he never got married and didn't have children.  As he said at one point Star Fleet was his family.

One aspect that I think will annoy the faithful is the fact that most of the characters from the series really don't have much to do in this film.  It is about Picard and Data.  There is a little humor especially from Worf (mutters ""Irving Berlin"" groan).

It is the end of the line for Next Generation.  Some people wanted more.  I think the ending could have been better.  There is a deleted scene I think would have been nice if it was left in.  After seeing how they handled Kirks end, I guess they like going out with not a bang but a whimper.

The extras should be viewed at least once as you get an idea to what Baird was trying to do.

I guess if you never have seen this film, it might be a good idea to rent it first.  I would emphasize renting first for the hardcore followers.

One final note:  I don't get the comparisons to ST II and ST III that some of the other reviewers have made.  Those were actually pretty good films, II being one of the best.

The entire plot of Nemisis is borrowed from Star Trek II & III. And I am dead certain those who really loved this film probably never saw any of the two originals Nemisis lifts the majority of its plot from.  For those who have, this film will feel unoriginal and uninspired. And unlike Star Trek II, where we also lost a critical character, we feel almost no emotion as a main character dies in Nemisis.

For those who said Insurrection was bad because it had less action than Nemisis or First Contact and was slow because it was confined mostly to one set: this movie suffers the opposite fate. At the very least Insurrection deeply rooted in what Roddenberry referred to as the ""human conidtion"" which had not existed in Sci-Fi prior to Star Trek's creation. There is no ""human condition"" here. The film is so stale you feel almost nothing for these characters on their ""last"" voyage together. That's an amazing acomplishment.

Yes there are a lot of features left off the original Nemisis DVD. However, unless you buy this DVD for the extras it's not worth it {the original Nemisis already had enough extras anyway}.

It's funny to think that the best trek in recent years have been the garfield-stevens/shatner outings in book form.",1127520000,4,669,4.605042016806722
1463856,3,B00005JLRT,"never mind the pun.  He explained adequetly why he did what he did.  They hired 'em, that's what you get.  However by an audience stand point, nearly EVERY regular cast character acted OUT of character COMPLETELY.  It wasn't your 1980's style go-softly-yet-valently hero it was like a 21st C '02 b*** fest.  Picard was totaly out of element(I liked the driving that wasn't it at all, he needs some action)  Data's infamous heroism wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good either.  The other thing was just stupid.  It was like they were replacing Data with, well, another Data.  A moron version.  Which seemed to be the theme of the whole crew.  An IQ drop of 7 points and then some more later on.  The marrage scene(yeah that is pretty STNG BUT) was stupid and could have been done more in character.  The atmospere was not STNG in the ship at all.  The exterior scenes were very good and refreshing(more STNG should've taken place outside I think in the show and past movies).  what was wrong wasn't the actiion scenes as in a post nuclear holicost moive, it was what was MISSING.  The INTELLIGENCE behind those scenes.  A staple in Gene Rodenberry Star Trek.  The young picard wasn't half bad, the Remons and Romulans were.  Remons(counter parts) are just stupid brutes with no intimidation or ferocity at all.  Disappointing.  Not scary.  It is not the worst film in the bunch.  ST V was by far the worst attempt(not because of lack of SFX)  I was slightly annoyed by ""Generations"" as well as it should've just been named ""The Two Captains"" as in Doctor Who's ""The Two Doctors"" as that is what it implied.  You can't sue an american if yer a brit. ;)  I think this is a fun watch more for the action hero type than the Star Trek fan, but fun.  Watch!  Three Obsidian coins!

1463859,2,B00005JLRT,"Being a Trek fan for 30 something odd years I have seen 100's of hours of Trek from the time I was 5 until now so I think it's easy to see what works and what doesn't. This unfortunately does not. You have a movie that closely resembles the best Trek film Star Trek 2 but not nearly as good; The revenge storyline down to the sacrifice at the end of the film. Been there, seen that, but with out the humanity and adventure brought to the characters that was so evident in S.T. 2.

I remember reading a lot about the movie before it opened and was eagerly awaiting this movie but they cut quite a few scenes with could have enriched the film and given the characters more to do. Gone are scenes at Riker and Troi's wedding (If you look closely you can see the character of Wesley) which I think would have brought this up a notch. There was another scene between Data and Picard over a glass of wine that was cut and a longer ending which would have brought more closure to the Next Gen. Crew.

Why not reedit this for the fans that wanted to see it?

As these Special Editions are rolled out every few months they get less ""Special"" and seem to throw things out there for money sakes.

Why not a cast commentary?

And as one of my colleagues pointed out we get to see the Romulans, my favorite oponents. All in all it is my favorite Star Trek movie only second to Star Trek 1.",1127174400,,465,3.9468085106382977

But as I watched it on DVD, I began to see some good aspects to the film.  The one aspect of the picture I didn't like was the kid who played Shinzon.  His acting left much to be desired.  But as you look at the Next Generation characters, many of them look inside themselves to give good performences.  Although Data dying wasn't nearly as emotional as Spock's, it allowed the audince to realize how important Data is to the cast.  The film also has some fantastic special effects, and a killer space battle that rivals the Wrath of Khan's ending space battle.  Again, for those of you who are thinking, ""What's this joker taking about?"" let me state that I think Star Treks 2,4,6,7,8,and,9 are vastly superiour films, but at least this film is better than 1,3,and 5.",1126396800,2,921,4.376470588235295
1463929,5,B00005JLRT,I thought that this movie was better than any of the Star Trek movies yet. We finally had a movie about the Romulans and the battles were amazing. I don't know why so many people ripped on this movie. Porbably the same people who destroyed Enterprise. So don't let them scare you away from such a great film.,1126051200,3,308,4.327586206896552
1463930,4,B00005JLRT,"The plot of ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" comes down to three situations. First, and most importantly, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) discovers that he not only has a clone (Tom Hardy) who was created by the Romulans by raised by the Remuseans, but that the enterprising Shinzon has become Praetor of the Romulan Empire, which has a weapon that can destroy all life on Earth. Second, in an obvious parallel, Data (Brent Spiner) discovers yet another of Dr. Soong's prototype androids, named B-4 (also Spiner). Third, and finally in more ways than one, Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) are finally getting married. This 10th Star Trek film, and four in the STNG part of the series, has its moments but is ultimately less than satisfying.

Part of the problem is that even before the film's climatic death scene we are already aware that we have another Star Trek death that is not really death scene. Yes, this is certainly more plausible than the first one in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan""/""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"" but that it is at the expense of the shock and emotional impact the first time around. Consequently, the big payoff rings hollow, which is never a good sing for a major theatrical release.

Another part of the problem is that the cast is so large that few of them have much of value to do. Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton) has been standing by for several films mainly to ask Data what he is doing so the android can explain, Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) waits for casualties to show up in sick bay, and Worf (Michael Dorn) is at least good for a few laughs with the comments he makes in his cups while everyone is toasting Riker and Troi. As far as the movies go, STNG has boiled down to Picard and Data, and the rest are along for the ride, posing stiffly and formly in the background. That being said, ""Nemesis"" finally gives Counselor Troi the main supporting role and a couple of scenes when she proves she can give as well as receive. But overall there are two many cast members sitting around with little or nothing to do; compare this with the series finale ""All Good Things...""

Finally, there are just too many significant gaps in the thinking of the main characters. Picard and his clone think they understand each other as if in the future the nature versus nurture issue has gone the way of safety belts being required on alll chairs on spaceships. Yes, having a clone is creeping. Yes, having your clone serving in a Romulan slave pit is disturbing. But the idea that the result is a younger version of itself was never legitimated by novels/films like ""The Boys From Brazil."" This is supposed to be the future, but the ""science"" here is about on par with a 1950s film. If I, who know virtually nothing about science in general or cloning in particular can see the holes in this logic, than Picard's Starfleet Academy training should serve him in much better stead.

Now that we are apparently here at the end of the road for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" it might be appropriate to conduct a post mortem and consider the question of why the theatrical films were never as good as any of the two-part episodes of the television series. The short explanation is they went for bigger (e.g., the Borg rewrite human history) rather than better. What is so puzzling is why a creative staff that came up with several solid story lines almost every season for many years could not cut it when it was required to come up with one very good idea every few years. ""Star Trek - Nemesis"" has the characters of STNG but neither the style nor the substance; what does Picard driving a intergalactic dune buggy have to do with why we loved this television show? Plus, the lighting makes Data's skin look really weird. At least we have the complete ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" out on DVD now.",1126051200,,3861,4.599419448476052

1463934,4,B00005JLRT,"It was just a couple of years ago that Star Trek Nemesis, featuring the final journey of the next generation crew was released on DVD. Featuring the music of the late veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, it tells the story of how the Enterprise-E, led by Captain Picard is invited by the Romulans to commence final peace negotiations. Unfortunately it is all a ploy by a younger clone of Captain Picard to not only cripple the Federation but exterminate Earth altogether using their new weapon. The weapon is stored aboard Shinzon's ultra-predator-battleship that carries enough photon torpedoes to take out entire fleets of starships, and a perfect cloaking device making it possible to fire in perfect invisibility- unlike the klingon ship from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country that had a flaw. Complicating circumstances is the discovery of a prototype android of the Enterprise's Lt Commander Data.

There is definitely a sense of goodbye with this film, and although Star Trek Nemesis may not be the final Star Trek movie, it is most likely the final next generation movie. Partings in this film, as well as the loss of a beloved member of our senior crew, include Dr Beverly Crusher who is transferring to Starfleet Medical (as she did in Season 2 of Star Trek The Next Generation), Riker who at last has accepted his promotion to Captain and is taking command of another starship, and Counselor Deanna Troi who is going with him as his wife. In this final next generation movie we also get to see Lt Commander Worf who though leaving to be an ambassador at the end of Star Trek Deep Space Nine has returned to the Enterprise crew. Other minor appearances include Janeway who was promoted to Admiral after leading the crew from Star Trek Voyager home, Guinan who was last seen in Star Trek Generations and Wesley Crusher who we haven't seen since the final season of Star Trek The Next Generation.

As for my summary of the whole movie itself- I like it. Quite a few fans have berated it but I like it very much. Despite not being the most original story (just one ship battle really), the dark atmosphere (the darkest for a Star Trek movie to date) really takes our characters into genuine unknown territory. I'm also glad that some of the cheap jokes aimed at the very oldest of Star Trek fans is kept to a minimum here. A negative and a positive about Star Trek Nemesis is the realization of how old our crew have been getting, and indeed how Star Trek itself is. I think the biggest mistake was when the villain of Star Trek Insurrection referred to the Federation as being old. Star Trek is the Federation, and that reference makes Star Trek seem tired. I think that whole thought has connected with viewers, and quite possibly affected the success of Star Trek Nemesis, as well as the final season of Star Trek Deep Space Nine, the last three seasons of Star Trek Voyager, and most definitely the whole of Star Trek Enterprise. I hope that one day the producers of Star Trek move even further along in the Star Trek timeline to an all-new more positive future.

So now we have the new 2 Disc collectors edition of Star Trek Nemesis. New special features exclusive to this edition include the movie in more impactful DTS sound, an audio commentary by the man who has continued Star Trek within the 24th Century- Producer Rick Berman and a text commentary- regular to the collectors edition DVDs. New Production featurettes include Nemesis Revisited, Storyboarding the action, Build and rebuild, Four-Wheeling in the Final Frontier, Shinzon screen test. There are new Star Trek Universe featurettes including A Bold Vision of the Final Frontier, and The Enterprise-E. We also have featurettes studying the Romulan Empire including Romulan Lore, Shinzon & the Viceroy, Romulan Design, The Romulan Senate, The Scimitar. Other special features include new deleted scenes and trailers.

Special features from the first Star Trek Nemesis DVD are also included.

The story line would get slightly close to the edge of allowing the viewer to figure out what was actually going on but then, another turn in the plot would take the story to a different direction; ensuring that the viewer wouldn't figure it out until the director was ready for it to happen.

The whole ""dune buggy"" scene was cool as it allowed the Captain to have what I call -- ""a Kirk moment"" which I thought was due for the Captain.

1463937,2,B00005JLRT,"I don't know how to say this any other way but to come out and say it. Nemesis is a Bad Film. I have enjoyed Star Trek for almost thirty years. When did Star Trek go so wrong, and who is responsible. If you ask me Star Trek went wrong when it lost it's best writers people like Ron Moore and Ira Stephen Bare. The Next Generation had a rough start but when it got going was a terrific series thanks to people like Ron Moore who came along in the third season. Deep Space Nine was the Last good Trek series. Voyager was horrible it's first two seasons and while it got better in later seasons did more harm than good. Just look at what the series did to the Borg, a once menacing villain reduced to toothless jokes. The Only Time I enjoyed Voyaer was when barclay and the Dr. were featured at least they had character. If Voyager nearly killed trek Enterprise put the final nail in the coffin, I mean could there have been a duller show. The Entire cast was flat and devoid of personality including Scott Backula. He was wonderful in quantum leap, what happened. Bad Writing perhaps ?  Much of the Blame has to be with Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. If Trek is ever brought back jettisoning these two morons should be on the top of the list.

Nemesis is one of the most derivative films I have ever seen. It borrows heavily from Star Trek II, but has none of its charm. The only next Generation film I thought was fun to watch was First Contact. It was a roller coaster ride and didn't apologize for being so. Star Trek Generations had its moments, but was a very flawed movie. Insurrection was goofy and not in a good way.  It's painful watching a great cast of actors muttering through such poorly written dialogue in a story thats not going anywhere. I think what pains me the most when I watched this movie was here I was sitting in the theater watching the end of trek.  The Next Generation cast, people we have come to care about were hung up on the tracks and staring down a looming freight train.

There is no spirit of discovery left.  Berman and company have bled the turnip dry.  At least with the TOS films there seemed to be a desire to move the characters forward, despite the obvious and necessary commercial ambitions of the movies.  Berman seems content with just holding a record for spin-offs.  They tried to make this their Star Trek II with a black hat villain and heroic sacrifice in the end, but there's no emotional connection.

The biggest problem(despite a knuckle-headed decision to release it between Harry Potter and LOTR The Two Towers)was the story using ST II The Wrath of Khan as a template. The Next Gereration's final mission as they are led  into a trap by the new leader of Romulus who has a deep connection with Capt Jean Luc Picard. The sub plot of finding yet another Soong android didn't make things any better, as well as a cheat on the fate of Data.
The belief that Romulus would be controlled by not only their sub race,The Remans,but also make the Praetor,a human clone of Capt. Picard,as well as having an agenda to destroy the Federation(A repetitive,yet empty plot device).Nemesis has many great moments as well as the most exciting ship battle scenes ever seen in a ST movie. But as much as the TNG movies try,they are still big screen TV episodes.
Despite the many gapping plot holes as well as hearing fans rip this movie to shreds(It ranks above Search for Spock and Generations),Nemesis is still an entertaining movie(How could you top the collision scene!!!).",1122940800,7,1260,4.7272727272727275
1464010,4,B00005JLRT,"i have heard many people trash this movie, calling it ""khan lite"" and even worse things, but i wish to disagree. the major

differance between the two movies has to do with what was going on with each crew. in the time of ""khan"" there a long and uneasy

peace among the major powers (in part due to the organian peace treaty) and the crew of enterprise 1701, had all moved on with

there careers and were happy with what they were doing. that is everyone but jim kirk who had come to think the galaxy had passed him by. in fact one of the underlining currents of ""khan"", ""search for spock"", & ""voyage home"" was how much jim kirk could still do, could still be useful to the galaxy.

  in nemesis, the mood is much different. nemesis took place just 4 years after the end of the dominion war, the largest and most destuctive war to have occured since humans first went into space. the war almost brought the federation and the klingon empire to there knees, left cardassia prime looking like

berlin in 1945, and major federation worls like betazed recovering from invasion and occupation. in addition, after the

war there was the gateway crsis, the genesis wave crsis, plus many smaller actions to maintain and restore the peace. in this

environment even the best crew would be under great pressure. and so we come into nemesis and see that the crew is about to break up (to find out what extra pressures caused this to happen, you will have to read the 9 vol. a time to... books)

first is the wedding riker and troi, who will soon take command of the new luna class ship ""uss titan"", dr. crusher is going back to head starfleet medical, data is to become 1st officer and worf, having grown tried of being a ambassador, has his commission reinstated and is to become 2nd officer.

  so as you can see, the crew interaction completely diffent.

in addition, the release of ""khan"" from his prison world was a fluke, while the plot that brought ""shinzon"" to power was as cold and calulating as any romulan(or reman for that matter) plan. in addition, as to the deaths of spock and data, each was logical in it's own way. to quote spock ""the needs of the many outweigh the few, or the one"", and because the chareter of data

had gone about as far as it could in groth and still be a andriod it quite logical that data should save his crewmates, and it also logical that the chareter of data should end at this point.

  as to why this movie bombed at the box office and was the only ""star trek"" movie to ever lose money, i do not know. while it is not as good as ""khan"" or ""first contact"" it is much better than ""final frontier"". i hope there is a 11th movie out there soon, and i thing a mixing of ""next generation, ds9, and voyager"" crews would be great, such as seeing more of ""admiral janeway""",1122336000,8,2796,4.354527938342967
1464011,2,B00005JLRT,"Until this movie came along, the constant pattern had been: even-numbered Trek films good, odd-numbered Trek films mediocre or bad.

Alas, this even-numbered (10) Trek film is decidedly mediocre.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, I don't think the problem was a director who had no knowledge or love of Trek.  Nicholas Meyer had neither when he was hired and he did just fine.

The problem is that Baird isn't that good a director.  Or, rather, he's an ""action"" director, meaning that the focus of what he does tends to be action and not, say, characters or story.  Nemesis shows this clearly, as we are treated to a silly chase that doesn't advance the story one bit, with Picard gleefully speeding recklessly across the terrain.

It's also trying too hard to be Star Trek II (but then, aren't they all?).  Picard is given a suitable villain, and themes are woven so that the Picard/Shinzon conflict can explore them.  The difference is, Shinzon ultimately doesn't work because his origin is so contrived (and unnecessary), and the themes are touched on and abandoned.  Trek II, on the other hand, had a villain who was anything but contrived, and the themes were at the heart of the story, driving it, instead of just being along for the ride.

Finally, there's a needless death -- I won't say who, but it's pointless, and then immediately undermined.

Not all is bad.  Visually it's very well done, with some incredible effects, and there are some nice moments.  The cast, for the most part, falls into its comfort zone.  There are moments at the wedding that are downright hilarous.  It's not boring (Trek I), or silly and pointless (Insurrection), or completely incoherent (Trek V).  And I'll grab the SCE for the deleted scenes, and the text commentary (which is always brilliant).

1464013,2,B00005JLRT,"It seems oddly appropriate on the day of James Doohan's passing to say that ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" is a bad movie.  Just awful.  As much as the recently cancelled  ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", ""Nemesis"" is a symbol of just how far this once great franchise has fallen. It also dispels the notion that even numbered Star Trek movies do not stink.

It is obvious that the producers where attempting to make ""Nemesis"" the Next Gen's ""Wrath of Khan"".  Not only did they  fail miserably but it is almost insulting the extent to which they ripped-off almost every major plot thread from ""Wrath of Khan"".

This movie is cold, emotionless and lacks the passion and excitement of ""Wrath of Khan"".  Tom Hardy as Shinzon is supposed to be Khan to Picard's Kirk.  However, Hardy is no Ricardo Montalban  and Patrick Stewart, while a better actor than William Shatner, could not summon the requisite emotion to make this movie work.  The rest of the cast is no better.  Clearly tired of playing these roles the cast merely mailed in their performances.

The movies special effects and action sequences are  merely OK but do not come close to clearing the bar set by George Lucas and ILM.  Even if they did they would ultimately fall flat because the rest of the movie is so utterly horrendous.

The movies sole bright spot is the performance of Brent Spiner in a dual role as both Data and his Rainman like ""brother"" B4.  Spiner is so talented he simply never disappoints.  As a matter of fact the only scene in ""Nemesis"" that conveys any real emotion is Data's Irish wake at the end of the film.

Leave it to a movie this bad to leave an excellent scene on the cutting room floor.  One of the deleted scenes is an alternate ending where we would have been introduced to the Enterprise's new first office Commander Martin Madden, to have been played by first rate character actor Steven Culp (""Desperate Housewives"", ""JAG"", ""The West Wing"",  ""Star Trek: Enterprise"").  This light hearted scene which showed Riker leaving the Enterprise for the last time and ended with the Enterprise warping to where ""No Man has Gone Before"" was shelved.  In its place the movie ends with the Enterprise in an orbital dry dock undergoing repairs.  An unworthy ending to end what was once a first rate franchise known as Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Star Trek is in desperate need of fresh blood and a new perspective.  Rick Berman has run this franchise into the ground.  He should step aside but sadly I do not see this happening.",1121817600,13,2500,4.648401826484018

1.) Hiring a director (Stuart Baird) who had no love/knowledge of the Star Trek franchise.  Stuart Baird was not a good choice for the direction of this film.  Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton or David Carson would have been a good choice to direct this film.

2.)Dec. 13 release date.  Released less than a week before Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Star Trek: Nemesis did not stand a chance at the box office.  Maid In Manhatten did well only because of the hipe over Jennifer Lopez and her relationship, which was about to explode, with Ben Afflack.  Harry Potter and Die Another Day were also two other movies that posed a threat to Nemesis.

3.) 50 minutes of deleted scenes hurt the film.  Even though some were deleted because it dragged the movie out some should have remained such as the scene between Picard and Data after the wedding, extended wedding sequence scenes and more indepth scenes with Shinzon.

All in all I give this Special Collectors Edition 5-stars because Nemesis is a good film (even though it has problems)and deserves to be given a second chance.  This is a must have DVD for any sci-fi/Star Trek fan.",1121472000,5,1450,4.5482625482625485
1464015,2,B00005JLRT,"A lot like a simple episode of ST-TNG, only sillier... here are just a few examples:

At the start of the film, we have a ridiculous wedding scene between Riker and Troi, and then a bunch of dumb jokes about a followup nude wedding on Betazed.

Fairly early on, Picard, Data and Worf come across a disassembled early version of Data - and he just happens to have aged exactly as Data has aged... this makes absolutely zero sense - except, of course, that they don't have the special effects to be able to have B4 be like a young Data, which would have made sense.

Then, for some reason, the Reman Viceroy can penetrate Troi's thoughts... and when all appears lost in the battle sequence, Troi FINALLY figures out she can penetrate his thoughts to pinpoint the cloaked ship, and guides Riker's hand at the controls (CORNY!) - why doesn't she just do it herself.

Near the end of the film, Picard (but ONLY Picard mind you), beams over to the Reman Scimitar - and then sparks fly out of LaForge's control panel, and he declares that the transporter is down.  This scene is worse than anything from an actual episode on TV.

The stupidest part of all has to be the exceedingly lengthy time that the Scimitar's ""secret weapon"" needs to charge up - but, of course, the universe is saved at the last second... ho hum.",1121040000,,1312,4.468619246861925

I think it's because this movie spends a little more time developing the villian than the other movies do.

Unfortunately, you can't develop a villian in two hours that will match a cast of heros that were developed over seven years.  This film gives it a try though, and doesn't do a bad job.  The only problem is, so much screen time is spent developing this villian that not enough time is available to go to the familiar cast we all know and love.  It was a no-win situation.

But, honestly, it's not that bad as some say!

I went to see this with high hopes it was better than the last which was basically an episode of the Next Generation. How disappointing that the this was the best the writers could come up with.

I liked the character of Shinzon but he was poorly developed.

There was no chemistry between the crew members or so it seemed to me. The slap in the face was when they killed Data who became the best character in the series and the only one to hold my interest.

The writers seemed to just throw out another ST movie without thinking about a decent storyline and expect fans to accept it.

Most important was that the director never saw Star Trek before filming and never saw fit to watch any of it.  He wanted to make an action movie, which is what he did.  He cut out all the interpersonal relationships which make Trek what it is (check out the deleted scenes!).  He even wanted to cut the wedding completely out.

That said, the villain was more engaging than the cookie-cutter villains in past TNG films, the special effects were great and the ending was surprisingly touching.  Worth the money!",1118707200,,685,4.658333333333333
1464118,3,B00005JLRT,"Part of me really wants to be nice to ""Star Trek: Nemesis.""  After all, it could very well be the last Star Trek film ever.  However, this film has such major problems that it can't be viewed as more than a mediocre Trek entry.

The entire first hour of this film is borderline boring.  Star Trek film usually take a while to get going, but ""Nemesis"" takes this to absurd lengths.  Other than a shocking opening scene, very little happens in the film's first act, with the exception of the car chase (more on that atrocity later).  With the exception of Stewart, none of the actors here stand out.  The Trek regulars are obviously trying because they knew this would be their last gyst, but they still come off as dull, and Worf is turned into a comic sidekick.

The guest list in ""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection"" was impressive- Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Kridge, F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Zerbe, Donna Muprhey.  Here, we're instead stuck with Tom Hardy and Dina Meyer.  Hardy obviously tries as the villain Shinzon, but he's hampered by the fact that he bears no resemblance to Picard (who's supposedly his doppleganger) and that he spends half the film trying to imitate Khan (Trek villains really need to stop that; no one will ever again match Khan).  Meyer shows no energy whatsoever.  The only good guest star is Ron Perlman, but he's criminally underused (see ""Hellboy"" for what this guy is capable of).

The greatest flaw of ""Nemesis"" is that it is, at heart, a dumb action film.  This is Star Trek Lite.  I suppose it was inevitable.  Star Trek films have always been about ideas over action, but in the age of loud explosions and mindless thrills (after all, Jerry Bruckheimer is now one of the most successful producers ever), this formula has come to look like a dinosaur to mainstream audiences.  The Star Trek producers would inevitably try to make the franchise appeal to mainstream audiences again by sacrificing Star Trek's very soul, while at the same time trying to keep hardcore fans on board.  The result is a film that is still too talky and slow for mainstream audiences, but is dumbed down just enough to piss off Trekkies.

Case in point is the ""car chase"" early on in the film.  It has little importance to the plot, and it's downright stupid.  Of course, it is competently done, but you never get the feeling when you're watching it that this is a Star Trek film- it could have been pulled out of any Bruckheimer picture.  I'm not even getting into the flaws that geeks spot, such as how the Enterprise crew in this sequence basically ignores all Federation protocol.

If it sounds like I'm roasting ""Nemesis,"" let me say that it's not a BAD movie in the sense that ""The Final Frontier"" was.  Indeed, ""Nemesis"" can be lauded for doing one thing right- saving its best for last.  All of its memorable moments happen in the final 40 minutes, which contain such impressive and tense space battles that you almost forget everything stupid that's happened before.  Almost, that is.

I gave both ""Insurrection"" and ""Nemesis"" three stars, but ""Insurrection"" is the superior film, if only because it tries to stick to the Star Trek formula.  ""Nemesis"" is a misguided attempt to reshape Star Trek into an action franchise, and it simply doesn't fit.  Star Trek is supposed to be about more than space battles and explosions.  I don't know if there will ever be another Trek film, but ""Nemesis"" shows what happens to good franchises when their producers decide that they must be dumbed down for mainstream tastes (see the 1989-1997 ""Batman"" franchise for another example of this).  It is an enjoyable film with some great action scenes, but it has little else.  And Star Trek deserves better.",1118707200,5,3723,4.724031007751938
1464119,5,B00005JLRT,"If anything is to go by, Nemesis is speeding faster even before you can mutter ""Maximum Warp"". With its two other predecessors, Nemesis is just one notch above First Contact and two notches above Insurrection. The last action packed Star Trek was First Contact. So, it goes to show that even-numbered Treak movies are action based and the odd-numbered ones are more to storyline based. I, for one, was impressed with the dogfight scenes between the Enterprise and the Reman warbird, Scimitar. As this movie was directed by Stuart Baird(Executive Decision), he brought in a different kind of action (probably his trademark for action) to Nemesis, which was never seen before in all other Trek movies. And the ironic thing is that Nemesis is able to standalone as a gripping sci-fi thriller, in its own right, while at the same time linked to the entire Star Trek anthology. One of the reason Nemesis didn't do well at the box office is that it was shown a week before The Lord Of The Rings (I'm not sure which one of the 3). What a way to ruin a good Trek movie but I can't blame them as November is usually the traditional month when a new Trek movie is release. But, being a staunch Trek fan, overall Nemesis is the best there is. Just can't wait for the next Trek movie though. Bloody marvellous.",1118707200,,1298,4.575107296137339

1464121,2,B00005JLRT,I liked the really dark horrible look of some of this but I was not entertained by the story or anything. It was one of the worst Star Trek movies. Too bad. Everyone seemed tired of it.,1115078400,4,185,4.027027027027027
1464122,5,B00005JLRT,"""Star Trek - Nemesis"" was a huge failure at the box office, for reasons that no one really can explain. Obviously, people have seen so much Star Trek that they do not care anymore about a bit more or less of it. But, make no mistake, this does not mean that Nemesis necessarily was a bad movie!

In fact, Nemesis was a great movie. It had very tough moral implications by posing the question how much of you is really determined by your genetic material or heritage and how much you have to decide yourself. This was embedded in a dark and challenging plot, asking just that question concerning Picard and his clone, Shinzon, and concerning Data and his twin, B4. It also saw the crew going their seperate ways and leaving the Enterprise-family, pursuing their own careers and lives. The movie was filled with a suspenseful, political plot and taken to its climax by a great, long breath-taking space battle and the subsequent self-sacrifice of Data, reaching his goal of being human at that very moment.

Of course, Nemesis also had its flaws. Many secondary characters had very small roles and really not much but the usual to do, but after all this is a motion picture and not a super-sized TV-episode designed to develop each and every character. With Stuart Baird a non-Trek director was chosen, and that different attitude could be felt. At times, Nemesis veered off too much from the usual Trek-spirit into Sci-Fi action. Also, the writer John Logan crafted a sometimes slightly contsructed story conveniently ignoring some well established facts (Wesley Crusher, Data's emotion chip, B4). But in the end, this was partly in response to the growing criticism of Star Trek and a try to give it some new energy, which succeeded in some parts, but failed in others. Still, Nemesis was a great movie and a great addition to it's three predecessors. After all, you can't do everything in every movie, so this gravitated a bit into the action-thriller genre, but why shouldn't it? It is fine in so far as ""First Contact"" was a time-travel horror-adventure and ""Insurrection"" a Sci-Fi action-comedy, each and every one of them a fantastic movie, adding to the bigger picture of ""Next Genration""-movies.

The box office results made sure that this really was the final journey of the ""Next Generation""-crew, but I really do not accept the reason stated for that by most of the media and also many ""fans"". Nothing would have probably changed if the film was any different, because you first have to go and see it to call it bad, and if you didn'f see it in the first place, you probably would not have however good it was.

In the end, it was a fitting end for the crew and made a very modern, developed impression. Whether it will have been the last of the Star Trek-movies remains to be seen, but even if that is the case, the Star Trek movies will have gone out with a bang, not a whimper!",1112832000,8,2890,4.649706457925636

I thought it was an ok movie, but it didn't resolve as well as it could. I wanted to see Riker's ship and see where everyone went.

After seeing this film in theaters I was blown away at the fast paced action packed plot line.
The film does have a silly sub plot with the other version of Data but who can not love the battle of wits between the two men in the dead of space. Finally Picard has a real equal like Kirk had in Khan from ST 2. Picard also let lose and showed that he isn't really the thinking old man that the TV series showed him to be. Also the scimitar is the coolest ship ever to come out of the ST universe which felt like an homage to ST 6.
This movie with great sci-fi fun in mind and it hits home hard. Pick this film up and lose yourself in the phaser blasting light show or starship battles to save all of mankind aswell as themselves.

When first released I watched it in the theaters as a gift from my son and , although recovering from a massive heart attack earlier in the year plus being seated on the 1st row of the theater, I managed to enjoy a very profound movie. Granted the death of Data smacked of another death in the Star Trek family(Spock) and the revenge of the main villian smacked of another revenge seeker(Khan),I'm still found my interested peaked. The special effects were great as were the overall roles of all the characters. So the sales sucked and the movie panned out, but, no reason to kill the saga of Star Trek.

1464224,1,B00005JLRT,"This is certainly the worst of all the Trek films: I have no idea what they were thinking ($$?) when they made this one.

The plotline is illogical, unfocused, inconsistent, confusing and so poorly written that even some of the TNG season two stinkers (Samaritan Snare, anyone?) are more entertaining and satisfying to watch. Half the screen time you have no idea why the character is doing what it's doing. And the way they killed off Data was truly pathetic.

I cannot understand what would motivate the producers to make this movie. It has no sense of wonder that made Star Trek  great in Generations, First Contact or Undiscovered Country. Even Insurrection, though lame and laid-back, was true to the spirit of Trek - it was like an average season finale parts I and II combined. Nemesis plays like a cheap sci-fi B movie - avoid at all costs.",1108857600,9,848,4.677852348993288
1464225,3,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis, ostensibly the final huzzah for the long-lived Next Generation crew, has its moments but never quite gels into a cohesive, compelling film. The opening tone of the movie is perfect: Troi and Riker getting hitched (finally); Worf, Data and Picard off on an expedition to find the source of anomalous Data-like signatures; unrest on Romulus. Well and good. Unfortunately, the movie begins to hit the skids there. The story, written by John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator), is off his characteristically high standards. Logan has proven himself able to find the personal amid the epic, and Star Trek is often both, so he might seem an ideal candidate to pen this installment. However, this tone of this movie is too dour and too dark for most people to truly find enjoyable. This, I suspect, is more a direction problem than a screenplay problem (more on that in a minute), so I'll give Logan a pass. But you're on watch, Mr. Logan. The dialogue here is at its least memorable for Trek, all utilitarian, and although it mostly avoids cliche, it doesn't ever sparkle. There's no ""the line must be drawn here"" speech, sadly. There's an ""I would be this guy if I grew up like he did"" speech, in fact, there are quite a few of them. Cheer up, Jean-Luc, you'd probably have turned out like Idi Amin if you'd grown up like him. On an unrelated topic, I think Picard would have made a smashing dictator: imagine a planet full of bald, Shakespeare-quoting English-accented Frenchmen. Picardia. Rick Berman, give me a call.

This movie tries so hard to be the Next Generation crew's Wrath of Khan, with the obsessed, delusional villain, an outmatched and outgunned Enterprise, and a crew member's sacrifice. All that's missing is the heart. And a great deal of substance. Like Wrath of Khan, an outsider was brought in to direct this movie. Unfortunately, the outsider for Nemesis was Eurotrip and U.S. Marshals auteur Stewart Baird instead of the multitalented Nicholas Meyer. THE Nicholas Meyer (hereafter referred to as Saint Nick) had never directed a film before Wrath of Khan, but his outing in Khan was more than luck: this guy knew what he was doing. He managed to coax an entirely ham-free performance out of William Shatner, no small feat (and I love Bill Shatner, so don't scream at me). Khan was a seriously messed-up guy, but Ricardo Montalban played him with such magnetism and charisma you couldn't help but love the guy, at the very least love to hate him. Wrath of Khan was perfectly paced, technically marvelous, and full of touching (but not manipulative) moments. Saint Nick also co-wrote the screenplay for Star Trek IV and co-wrote and directed Star Trek VI, all the original series favorites. His resume speaks for itself. Let's look at Stewart Baird's resume. A quarter-remembered action flick from eight years ago, a raunchy teen sex comedy (coming in rated and unrated versions speaks for itself), and his magnum opus, Executive Decision, an inferior Air Force One copy. As a result of his action background, this movie often feels like a standard-issue thriller instead of a Trek film, with precious little thought and introspection in order to keep the action a-comin', and what thought there is becomes tiresome really quickly. In all fairness, the action is good, as are the special effects. But who cares? The story sucks. It is misdirected up the wazoo.  When it started, The Original Series had the most talented writing staff on television, and it had to: the shoestring effects were nothing special, and the budget was as empty as Scott Bakula's chair is now on Enterprise's bridge (cold, yes, but true). Well, Scotty B, it's time for a big Quantum Leap--to conventions! Okay, I'll stop, but I'll ask this question: Since when did the effects become more important than the substance? Why should I spend my hard-earned cash (in this case, my parents' hard-earned cash, because they treated) on a light show with an equally light story? Sadly, it seems, Star Trek is Trek as the producers have learned to play it: safe, unthreatening, but also soulless. Worrying about audience segmentation and profits does not a great movie make. Gene Roddenberry is, I hope, spinning in his grave, because his Star Trek was the other way around. Star Trek needed (and needs) a Deep Space Nine more than it could possibly know: if there is no new blood in the franchise, it will die of inbreeding. How many different alien names can you come up with, really? You're going to run out, eventually. As sad as it makes me feel, Nemesis is the future of Star Trek, not its past.

Say what you will about studio execs, but they can connect the dots:  most successful Trek pictures: Wrath of Khan, First Contact. Possible reasons: new directors, tension, excitement, epic action, substance. Lather, rinse, repeat. So, a great movie is a shopping list? If it's so simple, then why do so many movies suck? Apparently, the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy applies here--those factors were present in both films, but they weren't the reason they were great movies. These movies were spectacular because they spoke to timeless themes and gave the actors material to sink their teeth into, but also because they took extraordinary risks and succeeded wildly. Kirk is having a midlife crisis? Picard is obsessed with killing the Borg? These were quite bold risks to take with beloved characters decades in the making. Ultimately, for all the sermonizing and speechifying by Picard in this movie, this movie doesn't let him reject the thought that he could be the other guy, or be truly terrified of it. Data dies, but the B4 will probably take his place should another movie be made, and Riker not remembering the tune Data was whistling at Farpoint (Pop Goes the Weasel, by the way) doesn't nearly match the power of Kirk's final scene with his son at the end of Khan.  I would have liked to see what some really talented people could do with Star Trek: Paramount's got money, why not get great people to do this stuff (I fantasize about Aaron Sorkin writing a Trek movie), instead of second-rate action directors with portfolios consisting of fare that one sees during the summer, finds the ticket stub six months later in a coat pocket and can't remember the movie at all.

This movie, like most of the TNG movies was simply thrown together showing off special effects and blowing things up.  As other reviewers have noted, all the other characters besides Data and Picard have been reduced to background people.  Worf has become comic relief and a wimp compared to the Klingon with the warrior's heart in the TV series.  Nothing is familiar on the enterprise (it's just a ship like any other that they move around in and shoot things with)  The Borg are too emotional and ordinary with the introduction of the Borg queen as opposed to the cold mechanical unstoppable juggernaut of the TV series.  Now in this movie we come to B-4 the recently discovered and previously unheard of android that just came out of nowhere (the romulans just happen to find him laying around some planet).  If I remember right, Dr. Soong (Data's inventor) only created two androids.  Data and Lore (the evil prototype).  I could have written this story much better.  When I saw the preview and it showed two Data type androids, I suspected and was excited by the idea that they reassembled Lore for some necessary reason.  And finally, we have a movie about the Romulans that isn't about the Romulans.  The story is just thrown together.  I give it two stars just because it's mildly entertaining and worth watching just for the action....the only thing worth while that relates to the series is that Troi and Riker get married.

1464229,3,B00005JLRT,"One the one hand, it was rather refreshing to have a Romulan-themed story in quite a long time. The action sequences are super and the effects shots are great.
On the other hand, this latest (last?) Trek installment did leave this reviewer with several questions. Why did Wesley Crusher show up at First Officer William Riker and Counselor Diana Troi's pre-wedding banquet (see TheNextGeneration episode ""Journey's End"") ? What is Worf doing on board the Enterprise-E (see DeepSpaceNine series ender ""What You Leave Behind II"") ? And with Data ceasing to exist as a sentient being (he is said to have been killed off though he never in fact lived) and hence unable to assume the role of Second in Command, who then would assume Riker's role -  Geordi, Worf, or someone else?
Part of the blame for this movie's dismal box office performance must rest with the studio, both for releasing it up against ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" and deleting at least 41 minutes of filmed material. Having said all this, the movie itself comes up somewhat short indeed. The main flaw seems to be that it never sufficiently delves into the cause(s) for Shinzon's anger and enmity towards Picard and the whole human race. After all, was it not the Romulans who treated him so shabbily all these years?
It is far from certain if a feature-length story featuring DSN characters will be made, either with a few crossover characters from TNG or none. However, given the unexpectedly weak showing at the box office for this film and the less-than spectacular track record of its preceding films (only one is said to have reached the US$100M threshold) it is highly unlikely that there will be any more Star Trek theatrical movies; The Wrath of Khan, a film from which this one is unjustly accused of ripping off, nearly became a non-theatrical movie.",1106352000,,1833,4.782334384858044

We aspire to better ourselves, but that can not be reasoned by a clone. It is not real, it is just an echo. On the heels of Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan, this movie stands as the best of the Next Generation movies made. That right! When you think about how the Romulans are willing to act, when you think that you are going to be one to make diplomatic contact and be friends, when you find a foe that rather end everything else, instead of himself (as a clone) you as the Captain Picard are just presented with one of the weirdest battles a person would ever face. See yourself, and the other side of you, as presented by your clone. And as the real person, at all costs to normality, you can not let it happen, personally to the point of giving your own life to leave others to live, except for a robot, that aspires to be human, but can not, and sees himself with a B4 model, that drives it also drives this movie as a total experience. Unlike a human, a robot can sacrify his life, he is just a mere robot, and in the end, becomes more human just by that act, but will not realize it. The depth of this film demands full attention, as to all the details, such as the strife within the Romulans with some wanting peace and some willing to do anything for war and to win. With only one purpose in mind, what is your purpose in life? To aspire to be better, to be more, or to end it all, and be known throughout the Galaxy (or so you think) as someone who was really thinking that anyone is that important?

Also again, the crew of the Enterprise crash the Enterprise, like never before, because even if you just got married, you may end up dying, and only could live for the moment, and not perhaps, for the future of your dreams!

1464231,4,B00005JLRT,"Unless science fiction is very, very ""hard"" -- and sometimes even then -- there are always elements of fantasy involved, especially when it's presented onscreen. Whether on television or on the silver screen, Star Trek (ostensibly a science fiction series) has never been shy about using however much or little fantasy is required to make its point. The show has always been first and last a humanist morality play, a myth for modern times, and to critique it solely from the point of view of hard science misses the point.

That said, I liked this DVD even better than a DVD I saw first, Spider-Man 2 (likewise a morality play in the best Marvel Comics tradition) -- which is saying a great deal. Many have already commented on the plot of ST: Nemesis, so I need say no more here. But for me, at least, the Star Trek universe is more ""realistic"" than that of Peter Parker, even though he lives and moves (so splendidly!) in modern New York. I think it's because the humans and aliens in this film are not superpowered; it's their machines as extensions of (yet as separate from) themselves that have tremendous capacities for good or evil. Moreover, Picard and his nemesis Shinzon (thanks to the respective technologies at their service) are not nearly so equally matched as Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus apparently are. ""Doc Ock"", those mighty mechanical arms notwithstanding, has a human part vulnerable to Spider-Man's superior fleshly strength. Shinzon's Scimitar is a ""predator"" that eats Federation starships and Romulan Warbirds (not to overlook planets like Earth) for breakfast. Only great skill, character and sacrifice on the part of Picard and Data in particular can overcome Shinzon's advantages. If anything, I think that Spider-Man's dictum ""with great power comes great responsibility"" is even more one of the themes of ST: Nemesis than of Spider-Man 2 -- even if that theme is not one of the overt aims of the first film.

And now, let's hope that the next film in this series breaks the pattern of odd-numbered Trek films being of lesser quality...",1105747200,,2064,4.894285714285714

Some have conerns about the storyline.  I thought it was good enough to hold up the characters and I loved Tom Hardy as the evil Praetor Shinzon.  He was a physically and mentally impressive and a capable ""nemesis"" to our beloved Captain Picard.

Hardy takes away valuable screen time from some of our usual TNG characters, and the performances of Dr. Crusher and even Deanna seem perfunctory at best.  I grew weary of Deanna's uncharacteristically sad, tear-stained face.

Overall, it's a great TNG romp through the evil underbelly of the unknown and a showcase for good versus evil as well as Captail Picard and Data. Definitely worth seeing and a worthy film for your collection.",1105056000,2,936,5.006451612903226

1464322,2,B00005JLRT,"Well, the ""even"" numbered grace finally failed. First Contact is exciting, warm, humorous, and best of all, captured Rodenberry's vision of the future with near perfection. And while it had action, it was a Star Trek production, not just some action film. This one is not only is bereft of any kind of meaningful plot, but after the big action ""highlight"" - crashing ships in space, we then have Data needlessly killing himself (did they not recall those transporter bracelets from the TNG series? ""Timescapes"" was the episode, in case they wish to wiggle out of this one in any number of ways. I suggest that we have Data accidentally activate his dream program in the Holodeck, and thereby account for this mess, as he walks out shaken. After all, even he would bore himself to sleep with the plot!) Seriously, to end the Trek future with a deliberate and quite unecessary suicide would be absolutely anathema to Gene Roddenberry and all for which he stood. Suicide is never a ""sacrifice"" (especially when there are alternatives), and knowing that action films appeal to teen boys, is irresponsible in a way that Star Trek would never be. So it's just not a Star Trek film; it's someone's dull fantasy. And it is cruel to those fans who have adored ""Data"" for all the years. It is simply out of character for him to have resolved the situation this way, because Data's kind heart (which he ALWAYS had - this was always the in-joke that only he did not get) would never cause such pain to his friends, his family when all he had to do was grab a transporter bracelet (or similar device), set a phaser on overload, and return. I know, the actor was getting antsy, and hates the make-up, but minds can always be changed (as Nimoy knows) even in the worst of plot errors. The TNG characters are all too superb to just vanish in this distressing and violent way.

Let's face it: the only way for the TNG cast to make an exit is to bring back Q (and maybe a few others), have some fun, and leave the future to the audience's imagination. I would venture that they go to a cable mini-series for a proper send-off -thereby avoiding the ""odd-number jinx,"" and have a reunion of many dear characters. Is this not the time, when science fact and fiction are blurring at a blinding rate? And I am sure that with Frakes or even Nimoy himself directing -- either would do, the Trek family can move on to the future with heads held high and with Data's future still a wonderful stew of endless possibility. (And aw heck, if it's that important to the actor, we can have Dr. Crusher improve his skin color and free Spiner of that dread make-up!) Oh, and remember from the series, he does have an appearance aging program - that was the episode with his ""mom."" Heck, Patrick Stewart seems ready for some sort of sequel, and Spiner himself clearly is realizing what a bad idea this was, and well, it's time.

All the best to the future, real and imagined,

1464323,5,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis is one terrific movie! I'm a big NextGen fan, and I was verrry disappointed with their last outing (Insurrection was totally lame). What a turnaround!

Just the fact that Riker and Troi are married is enough to push this one up to the top, but there is so much more. With the exception of the early dune buggy scene the script is top-notch, the battle scenes are stunning, there's a bit of that Star Trek humor (but without being hokey), and the Nemesis surpasses the Borg Queen as the best of the Trek villains.

Tom Hardy's Shinzon is a multi-layered personality, and Hardy plays him with a subtle intensity and a great sarcastic edge. He gives us a villain that is both menacing and pitiable -- not an easy task to pull off.

I hope this isn't the last of the Next Generation films, but if it is, they've gone out with one to be proud of!! Don't miss it.",1101859200,4,876,4.361963190184049
1464324,2,B00005JLRT,"The tenth in the Star Trek movie series, Nemesis promises to be the last - I can only hope. Ever since Star Trek Generations, the first featuring The Next Generation (TNG) crew the series has gone from disappointing to bad to horrible. Generations was an awkward attempt to bridge The Original Series (TOS) crew with TNG. Its closing scene features the death of legendary Captain Kirk - a scene so bad it had to be refilmed after test audience practically rioted after witnessing the original version. The final cut was hardly better. First Contact followed and was a poor rehash of many already worn out themes from TNG such as the Borg and scarecrow boy Data's unending search for humanity. The inexplicable Insurrection was so bad my mind blocked out all knowledge that I had ever witnessed it like a traumatic childhood experience. Only intensive refreshing with Dave the movie guru was able to reawaken these troubling memories. Finally, Nemesis (aka The Final Insult) closes the Start Trek movie saga with a whimper of unoriginality.

Your humble reviewer is an old school trekkie who loves both TOS and TNG so there is no series bias here. I thought the TNG TV series was excellent, and remain extremely disappointed that the TNG movies are unable to even rival the quality of the old 60 minute TV shows. The TNG movie series attempted to win both the discriminating existing trekkie audience and still appeal to the general movie going public as well. Obviously, it has failed to appeal to any mass audience and has only further alienated existing trekkies. Nemesis scored a lousy 43% on the Tomatometer and has failed to take in any serious money at the box office.

The plot seems promising: a Picard clone created by the Romulans with the intention of replacing the real Picard rebels against his Romulan captors to lead the Reman slave race in a bid for control of the quadrant. The clone has built a super space ship with a super radiation weapon of some kind so powerful it could wipe out an entire planet with one shot - sound familiar yet? The Real Picard is drawn in and proceeds to confront his ""nemesis"".

The film opens with a ridiculously contrived action sequence in which Picard, Data and Worf fly a shuttle craft down to a strange planet and proceed to drive a dune buggy like vehicle around searching for what turn out to be chunks of a Data prototype. The party is ambushed by some Mad Max looking raiders toting archaic machine guns. First of all, you never take a shuttle craft when you could easily beam down to the surface. Second, there is no way the party could be ambushed by such primitive creatures, the Enterprise thoroughly scanned the area and would have surely warned the captain of such impending trouble. Heck, even their handheld tricorders should have picked them up! It's all really a setup for The Big Stunt where the dune buggy is driven off a cliff into the bay of the remote controlled shuttle craft as the party escapes the bad guys. The reason for the dune buggy is explained away as ""captain's prerogative"" and it is implied that Picard was just out for a little fun. This is completely out of the established Picard character. It's also completely unlikely that there would by many such thrill seekers left in Starfleet as they all have access to the way cool holodeck where any such fun can be had any time someone gets that daredevil itch. I never thought I would be accusing Star Trek of manufacturing such low brow action but there it is. Apply preceding criticism to almost all remaining scenes.

The film meanders on with many similar gratuitous action sequences. Phaser rifle shootouts in the halls of the ship. Unending volleys of phaser and torpedo fire between ships.

The crux of the story is this: the clone Shinzon is madly driven by vengeance and is determined to destroy the earth with his radiation weapon thingy. Yet the film never establishes his alleged hatred of mankind or any motive whatsoever that he might have against earth. If anything, he should be out to get the Romulans, who left him for dead in the Reman dilithium mines. Instead he is driven to help the very people who brought him true suffering.

There is also an underlying theme regarding Shinzon's status as a clone. There is an old scientific debate regarding the formation of a human personality and behavior patterns as being determined predominantly by genetics, or by environment. Shinzon believes he is a mirror image of Picard, being a clone and all, and that he is doing exactly what his environment dictates. He tells Picard that he would have done the same thing had Picard been in Shinzon's place. Aside from being massively irrelevant to the story presented (it would seem the only purpose for this fact is to give the movie a cool name) it ends up being very unrealistic in practice. Picard's character has been well established over the 7 year TNG series - and one thing is certain - he is a reasonable and rational man to the last, and would have chosen a very different course of action given Shinzon's environment.

There are more plot mistakes and glaring inconsistencies with the existing Star Trek universe that it's almost as if the film was intended to stand alone, separate from history. Taking such a stance would not improve my rating much.

The effects in Nemesis are acceptable. However they fail to inspire the awe and wonder of earlier, better films like the original Motion Picture, or Wrath of Khan in particular. The original model work was much better - the current Enterprise has gotten cluttered and lacks the simple elegance of the originals.

Nemesis lacks any sense of originality and rips off many better films in its muddled execution. In particular many have made reference to Wrath of Khan which Nemesis badly imitates in many respects, the vengeance motivated plot, the naval style duel between the two ships, and the tragic death of a key character who sacrifices himself for the ship. Needless to say, it is a poor imitation of a truly excellent film. As stated before, the vengeance motivation is very badly formed, there is no connection between Shinzon and Picard or the rest of humanity. Unlike the original battles in Wrath of Khan, the fight scenes in Nemesis are thoughtless, no brainers consisting of point blank shots volleyed back and forth. There is no tension or suspense created in these scenes. And finally, it was sad to see Spock die, and the audience truly rejoiced at his rebirth. The death of data was lame at best, I for one am glad to see him finally go, and I won't be rooting for a comeback which was also tacked on as a possibility.

It's sad that Roddenberry's creation has been so badly distorted. TNG was a cerebral series that focused on internal human conflict and the very nature of existence. The movies fail because they reject this premise in favor of tacky space opera style shootouts and cheesy formula plots. I don't know if there is any plan to turn Voyager or the newest series into movies, it could hardly get any worse though.",1101859200,3,7050,4.724390243902439

1464326,4,B00005JLRT,"I agree that Nemesis was not without some flaws and it carried on a more darker vision of the Next Generation series as did First Contact, but it was a good movie altogther. It certainly had a better plot than the previous Insurrection and even Generations which I felt had a very weak plot after all the publicity spent upon it.

Did anyone notice how the young Picard from the Next Gen tv episode ""Tapestry"" (5th season??) had ""hair"" during the fight with the Norsican and as they portray from pictures in Nemesis, Picard was as bald as he is now. Just a little nitpick there for Phil Farrand fans (wink).

The space battles with Shinzon's battleship, the Romulan cruisers and Enterprise-E were beautifully and flawlessly done, especially the ""ramming"" sequence.

I just found it a bit curious how the mainstream Romulans were apparently on Picard's side as was revealed in the ending battle. Isn't the Federation supposed to be on uneasy terms with Romulus?

I was shocked to see Data come to an end, but at least he went with a heroic cause. Of course the introduction of the B-4 android could easily be programmed to become another Data in time (with a little tweaking around from Geordi).

Nemesis ends with at least some sign that there may be a 5th Next Generation movie seeing that the Enterprise-E is in spacedock undergoing refit. Let's hope the next movie sheds some light upon the final frontier instead of remorse as did Nemesis..",1100908800,5,1444,4.714285714285714
1464327,1,B00005JLRT,"I grew up with the TNG crew, since I was quite young I watched the show religiously every week until it ended. I thought the series was incredible and definately one of the all-time greats. I'm a proud owner of all the Star Trek TNG season set boxes and I even enjoy star trek generations and insurrection! But this movie is just absolutely horrid. I feel like I'm wasting my time by writing anything more about it but since I'm here....

Why its bad: The Writing is simply horrible, the moron that wrote this screenplay didn't know the characters half as well as the average TNG fan. He simply got all of the characters WRONG. Picard does things he never would do, most of the cast is virtually ignored, Data isn't himself, etc etc. The actual storyline is laughable and seems like the plot was developed around the redundant action sequences rather than the other way around. This is the first piece of Star Trek that I would go as far to even call blasphemous. Every Star Trek movie from Trek 1-9 and all the shows including Voyager and Enterprise have atleast some element of the star trek spirit. This film is completely devoid of that spirit. If you are a self-respecting Star Trek (or TNG) fan avoid this like the plague. The story ends so badly for our beloved characters that it simply isn't worth seeing. I mean it, this movie will leave a bad taste in the mouth of any real trek fan. TNG ended with the masterful final episode of the series ""All Good Things"". That is the sendoff they deserved and the end that should be remembered. Trek movies 7-9 can be enjoyed for fluff but this movie should be AVOIDED.",1099267200,9,1618,4.4847457627118645
1464328,1,B00005JLRT,"This movie had the traditional sci-fi problem of producers who want more action and broader appeal. However, it had further issues: the writers of the movie apparently were not fans of the series at all. This resulted in  a plethora of extensive and glaring mistakes which fans who actually care about serialization readily noticed. Meaning that if one actually cares that the movie integrates into the star trek universe as laid out previously this movie is woefully inadequate and unworthy to be considered Canon of the ST universe.

The Romulans and the Federation fought alongside for three years yet the movie claims that the Fed and Romulans don't have proper docking procedures.... Then there are the defiant class collaborations with the Star Empire... among a lot of other Rom-Federation incidents that totally counter the retarded statement at the end of the movie about docking. When has a Star Trek Ship ever docked in space with another ship anyway... transporters and shuttle craft anyone?

In addition to the ludicrous ""docking procedure"" comments there is the issue of Picard supposedly having been bald when he was young... which is clearly countered by at least three cannon (TNG series) contradictions. The first is one of the episodes with Q, when we actually see Picard in his academy days. Dr. Crusher also in the series makes nostalgic reference to the ""young lieutenant who had hair"".

Further we have the question of Weasly Crusher. Crusher appears in a Starfleet Uniform... when we last saw Weasly he had abandoned his attempts to get into Starfleet academy and had taken up with the Traveler and was busy leaping time and space.

Then you have the data random whatever it is... Data's creator Doctor Noonien Soong clearly is shown in multiple episodes with reference to one and only one other Android in the style of Data. And that android would be Lore. The movie makes absolutely no attempt to reconcile this enormous fallacious hole in continuity and doesn't even seem to realize that the explanation for data's origins have already been provided by canon.

Then we have the creation entirely without basis of the so called ""Remus""  people... alright well i can deal with that ... Romulans would have been a whole lot more interesting given their established characteristics and extensive history dating back all the way to the Original series but the Remians were so shallow and not established as to create one of the most laughable villains in the entire history of Trek. Desiring to start an intergalactic war (see dominion war for how anxious all the powers involved would be to see yet another war in the Alpha quadrant) over something as freaking dumb as a blood transfusion has little appeal at all as a interesting story. Its a cop out from the writers from actually using the massive store of material available to generate an actually interesting story true to the canonized content already avalible.

The writers failed to learn the single most important lesson from the movie they stole their plot line from. ST TWOK (Wrath of Kahn) was a brilliant integration of the series character of Kahn into a unique and interesting story of revenge. What the writers stole was some lame combat idea which generated the action their producers wanted but left the plot both crippled and uninteresting to the aforementioned people who actually care that things relate to what has been established previously.",1096588800,5,3439,4.989528795811518
1464329,3,B00005JLRT,"At best, ""Nemesis"" is a decent Trek flick, though how much you like it will depend on how much you like TNG's band of Trek.

PLOT: The Romulan Star Empire suffers a militaristic coup.  (Romulans are perennial rivals of the Federation, and their background hints at the Chinese as well as imperial Rome).  Though Romulan generals are backing the move (in which the entire senate is killed by a mysterious radiation weapon that shrivels them), the real culprits are ""Remans"" - Nosferatu-looking denizens of Romulus's sister world.  Leading the faction is a young man who is neither Romulan nor Reman, but a cloned human named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  We learn that Romulans had cloned Starfleet Captain Picard years ago in hopes of substituting him and subverting Earth from within.  When the plan never panned out, Shinzon was discarded and sent to an almost certain death in the dilitium mines of Remus.  Big mistake - couldn't those silly Romulans have realized that Shinzon would survive the experience to become steeped in hatred of both Romulans and humans?  That he would rise to lead the Remans?  To build a monster super-starship that outguns and outruns anything built by anybody else in the Galaxy? And that he'd become everybody's problem?  Not realizing Shinzon's intentions or his origins, Starfleet dispatches Picard to Romulus to greet Shinzon - now the Praetor.  Before then, the Enterprise makes an unplanned stop on a remote pre-spaceflight world where they discover and activate an earlier model of Data.  Reaching Romulus, Picard soon learns the secret of their shared DNA and Shinzon's plans for Earth and the Romulans.

At best, Nemesis is okay - though at worst, it's got a loose plot that unravels quickly - richer than ""First Contact"", but inferior to that film which was more tightly plotted.  The Picard in ""Contact"" had some genuine character flaw - will he let his hatred of the Borg sway him from taking the right course?  Here, he's just compulsively noble.  Just about every scene raises questions, and not the kind that scripts should engender - Picard becomes a one-man fighting machine aboard Shinzon's ship; the Remans can snatch Picard off the Enterprise, but can't locate him on their own ship? Shinzon is supposed to be a clone of Picard - but was Picard bald at that age?  Also, he looks, acts and thinks nothing like Picard (though, in a thematic sense, the main characters are so interchangeable, they are largely clones of each other); the crew lands on a primitive planet whose backward inhabitants have otherwise matched Starfleet in the critical technology of dune-buggies.  Fans of Worf will lament his under-use hear (he seems snappy, like he knows that he's about to become somebody's punchline).  The script plays up the sentimental connections between main characters, even as it makes them as stiff as ever.  The story itself seems a pastiche of storylines from other Treks, especially the classic ""Wrath of Khan"" (the villain is an obsessed enemy with a painful past; a weapon that can render whole worlds lifeless; starship dogfighting inside of some nebula-looking thing climaxes the movie, along with an act of sacrifice by one of our heroes) and there aren't enough plot turns or twists to set Nemesis apart from the rest.

After two consecutive TREK films directed by ""Number One"" Jonathan Frakes, Stuart Baird takes the helm for this one, the 10th installment of the celebrated space saga. Baird, who had previously made EXECUTIVE DECISION (1996) and U.S. MARSHALLS (1998), is the first Briton to ever direct a STAR TREK film. That's neither here nor there; just a fun fact. The film he directs here is dark, much closer in tone to STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT (1996) than the lighter STAR TREK: INSURRECTION (1998). That's not to say that this film is as good as the incredibly amazing FIRST CONTACT; however, it's not any worse than INSURRECTION. In fact, I like it better than INSURRECTION. I really do not believe that this entry deserved all the bad press it received and all the bad reviews it still receives. However, I think that I can understand the reasons for the negativity: I intuit that, NEMESIS did not advance the story forward in the way that most TREK fans had wanted or expected.
I liked the beginning of the film, which has the entire crew celebrating the long-awaited marriage of Commander Will Riker (Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (a now curiously straight-haired Marina Sirtis---I liked it better they way it used to be). I also liked the surprising cameo by Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew from the beloved ""Star Trek Voyager"" series). I also liked the suspenseful setup with the Shinzon character; he seems evil, but seems to warmly treat the Captain, but he must have ulterior motives somewhere...I really did not know where the film was going to go till after the midway point, and that's a good thing. I do agree that the end result of NEMESIS is fairly disappointing, part of the reason being the death of a beloved character; however, most of the film contains a good mix of drama, action and even a little but humor (although not anything on the scale of the one-liner-laden INSURRECTION). I think the reason for the negative overreaction is that this will be the final TREK FILM featuring the ""Next Generation"" cast. I don't know what's to come after, but hopefully it will be as special as the STAR TREK franchise is as a whole...and hopefully, it will revive the now-sagging series.
Bottom line: Don't let the critics dissuade you; see this exciting film. In fact, you should add it to your STAR TREK collection. I have!

On the merits of the visual effects this movie does stand out. A lot of decent cgi work was done here, and the guys on that crew deserve credit. Though they alone could not save this movie.
I think the major problem was the story line and all that. This plot was so horribly flimsy that it could break like celophane on a window. There just wasn't anything remotely approaching interesting here. And adding a THIRD Song-type android was just...
THis movie was pretty terrible, and unfortunatly has killed off one of the best movie series ever. Berman has pretty much mutilated and slaughtered this series on all levels. Allas my old friend, I shall miss you.",1084752000,,888,4.6265822784810124

This statement held true for some 25 years (although I am rather partial to ""The Search for Spock"") until ""Nemesis"" hit the screen. This movie had lots of hype about the Romulans being in it, but it turned out to be full of plot holes and missed oppertunities. I ranted so much about what was wrong with ""Nemesis"" after I saw it that I ended up losing my voice.
Firstly, don't get me wrong - I love Star Trek, so much that even little things about ""Nemesis"" annoyed me. For example, how come Picard is bald in the picture of himself as a cadet? We've seen young Picard before - with hair. Also, what the hell happened to Wesley quitting the academy to go off with ""The Traveller""? Why does he show up at the wedding? And why isn't there any mention of Lore when B-4 is found - they don't even speculate as to how another android like Data ended up on some random planet! I also hated how the entire Romulan fleet could only muster up TWO lousy ships to help the Enterprise near the end. However the worst problem with the movie is the use of the transporter ""beacon"" - THE TRANSPORTER WAS DOWN! That's why a creative way of boarding the Romulan ship was required in the first place!! Surely that stupid little badge isn't a self-contained transporter...I hated the entire ending to this movie. I thought it was awkwardly written and directed - but I'll give ""Nemesis"" this: it's better than ""Insurrection"". The coolest thing about this movie ***SPOILER*** is the bit where the bridge gets blown apart, since I always wondered how it never got smoked before, being right near the hull and exposed to attack.
This movie was a huge dissappointment. Rent ""Wrath of Khan"" (especially to see a villain who isn't lame like Shinzon) or watch some TNG reruns instead of seeing ""Nemesis"". This movie serves mainly to remind the world that Rick Berman is finally starting to succeed in his apparant quest to destroy the Star Trek franchise via his ineptitude...",1083715200,7,2040,4.607142857142857

Here's a taste: The Romulans use expressions like ""Dead in the water."" Hmmmm, did it ever occur to the writer to at least try to make this comic book of a movie believable by having the Romulans speak as if they weren't born on Earth?
I would vote this as one of the worse Trek movies I've seen. Hopefully this will be the last movie based on the revamped series. Maybe it's time to resurrect Captain Kirk (along with a different director, producer and writer).
Not much as far as a story goes. Captain's evil clone out to rule the universe. Sort of like Austin Powers meets Trekkers. Story was utterly contrived and holes all over the place, for example, Data goes to rescue Captain Baldy, but only brings along one emergency transporter doohickey.

1464428,5,B00005JLRT,"This is actually the first Star Trek: The Next Generation film that I've found thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. Both GENERATIONS and FIRST CONTACT had significant instances where their plots seemed either outrageously unlikely (a Borg ""queen?"") or else outright contradictory (see Scotty's comments when he's discovered in ""Relics."") with the television series. INSURRECTION, although lacking the flaws of the earlier two films, watched - at best - like an overly-long episode of the show. NEMESIS, however, is noticeably free from these flaws.
The very act of featuring Romulans as the enemy in NEMESIS gives us a refreshing break from the now rather tired Federation/Klingon or Federation/Borg tensions that have dominated virtually all Star Trek feature films. On top of that, Shinzon is a three-dimensional villain. He isn't simply an incarnation of pure evil like the Borg Queen or Malcom McDowell's self-involved Dr. Soran. He's portrayed as a victim of his circumstances, with human weaknesses and curiosity.
As with drama, NEMESIS does exceedingly well with its comedic elements. It leaves behind the virtually slap-stick comedy of GENERATIONS (Data's repugnant ""emotion chip"") and FIRST CONTACT (James Cromwell's drunken Zephram Cochrane.) Instead, NEMESIS opts for a more sophisticated comedic tone. The crew enjoy a realistic camaraderie, poking fun at each other and dropping the occasional sarcastic comment without resorting to vulgarities.
Finally, the special effects and requisite battle scenes are most definitely well done. I frequently found myself anticipating most of the action in previous TNG films. NEMESIS, however, was full of pleasant surprises.
Overall, I think this is hands-down the best Next Generation film to date. It's funny, it's exciting and it's touching. It has, in fact, all the elements of good ""space drama,"" and they're executed perfectly.",1082160000,3,1893,5.576388888888889
1464486,4,B00005JLRT,"I used to love watching startrek TNG when i was a kid but after the tv series ended i kinda stopped watching it alltogether.. i did went to see Star Trek Generations & First Contact. I however after seeing 'first contact' realized that star trek isn't all what i thought it was.. not only that after getting into the X-files around the same time (actually i think i got into the Xfiles in 96-97'). To be honest with this is after going back to watching startrek again (after this dvd came out) realized that i mostly liked watching it for the action, not the drama..  Which basically thats what i base startrek on, not every episode or movie but its there.  Even though star trek: Nemesis does copy some elements from Star Trek II (which i saw way b4 nemesis) i still liked nemesis.  It doesnt make me like star trek anymore though then i already do, because really i think of it as another sci fi series. Alot of people were dissapointed & outraged about the death of a certain crew member & which is a copy off of ST II. However though this movie does have some really good qualities. The scene where data, la forge, worf & capt. Picard are looking for pieces of an android like data. Somehow during this scene i felt like i was having deja vu.. i don't know if it has anything to do with the series with Lor.. which by the way, what the heck happened to him?? I think when i saw previews of this movie i could have sworn Lor was going to be in this movie... i just had a feeling. Anyways one thing about Star Trek that i dint really like was the lack of action in it.. If u ask me even this movie dint have the action i wanted.. but im the type of person who would like to see action for like majority of the movie. Like any other movie this one is left open for another movie so don't just say that this is the last movie.. if they are going to do another movie its not going to be just a day to make so.. but if u havnt seen this movie yet.. at least rent it",1082160000,2,1963,4.093506493506493
1464487,4,B00005JLRT,"A fitting farewell to the Next Generation
Counsellor Troi and Cmdr. Will Riker finally get married, Data meets his other ""brother"" B4, and Capt. Picard meets a clone in this, the last film to feature the original cast of the second TV series to bear the Star Trek name. As it was planned to be the last movie, even Wesley Crusher {Wil Wheaton) makes a cameo appearance during the wedding sequence (he actually was supposed to have had more scenes, but they were edited out as the movie was initially overlong), when I first heard about this, I was very annoyed.  I hope someday Paramount will release a ""Collector's Edition"" of this movie, with the deleted scenes included.
The core of the plot has the Romulans finally proposing peace to the Federation, but it's all in vain as Picard's clone Shizon, (played brilliantly by Tom Hardy) has other plans.  It's also during this movie that a certain character finally realizes his goal of what it is to be human, but in a way you'd never expect unless you've already seen the movie.
Special effects again were outstanding, and this movie also has it's share of action.  The action sequences were top notch, especially the fight scene between the Viceroy and Riker. I really enjoyed the way they gradually revealed the relationship between Picard and Shizon and how Picard desperately tries to convince Shizon to become a better person than what he is now.  There were some slow parts in the movie, but not enough to ruin it.  In fact, I found the relationship between Capt. Jean Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Shizon very interesting and compelling.  Yes, the idea of a captain having an evil double or clone has been explored before in the original Star Trek series, but never to this extent.
Extras --  This DVD has the most extras, compared to the last two.  There are three documentaries on the making of the film, deleted scenes,  a commentary by the director (Stuart Baird) and a Photo Gallery, putting it on par with the recent ""Collector's Editions"" Paramount has been releasing of the first 6 Star Trek films on DVD.  As with the other editions, it is  Widescreen and digitally enhanced for 16:9 TV's.
I recommend this film to all Star Trek fans, but remember while you're reading this, that this is only my opinion, don't take it to heart.

I guess since I went into it with such low expectation, I was actually entertained.  I was less disappointed with this than I was with the Matrix 2&3 (although, to be fair, being in the sci-fi genre is about the only thing those to franchises share in common).  It may also be that I'm so far removed from my days of watching TNG that I'm not enamored with the characters anymore.  Either way, I was surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did.

1464491,2,B00005JLRT,"Only, this time the special effects are MUCH better.
Really, Nemesis is a spectacularly uninspired film that covers no new territory.  I myself, as a dedicated Star Trek fan, felt doubly cheated because the Romulans (otherwise ignored on the big screen throughout Star Trek's many films) played second banana to the weird Reman plot line and the even more improbable Shinzon story.
BEWARE, SPOILERS BELOW!
I can best sum up my problems with the film in the form of unanswered questions.  Like, how are the Remans at once slaves to the Romulans, but also capable of assembling, manning, and using the gigantic Scimitar spacecraft to basically take over the Empire?  Even if the Remans are part of the Romulan military industrial complex, and are able to create and man the Scimitar, why are there no Romulan officers onboard to maintain control and allegiance to the Empire?  If Shinzon is a failed Romulan experiment, why is he not simply killed, instead of being dumped into the Reman mines as a slave?  What use do the Remans themselves have for a weakling human, and why in the world do they take that boy, raise him up, and make him their leader?  How does Shinzon even know who Picard is, much less how he himself was cloned from Picard?  Why have the Romulans told him anything about his origins, and why does Shinzon then need to 'get even' with Picard, or destroy Earth and the Federation at all?
And so on, and so forth.  And I've not even touched on the ridiculous B4 plotline, which is a distraction all the way through the film, seemingly in place only so that Data can be killed off and then, in some future film perhaps, brought back into action as his engrams rise to the surface in B4 thereby turning B4 into Data all over again.  This deus ex machina robs Data's death of any significance whatsoever, because it becomes painfully obvious that if B4 has 'imprinted' on Data, eventually he will assume Data's personality, memories, capabilities, et cetera.  Or at least that was the impression I was left with.  Frankly, Star Trek has already been down this road once already with Spock; and it's a road Star Trek doesn't need to go down again!
Indications are that this is the final Star Trek feature film; or at least the final feature using the Next Generation cast exclusively.  Will some inspired person somewhere find a way to bring Nick Meyer back for a third outing, with an appropriately sturdy script?  He rescued Star Trek from its first feature film, then rescued Trek again from its fifth, and might be the perfect director to rescue Star Trek from its tenth.  We've got potential cast members from three television series that might be tapped.  The aftermath of the Dominion War has only been briefly touched upon.  A smart script might combine these characters and these elements into a nice movie, taking the Star Trek films in a new, necessary direction.
Or maybe Star Trek has simply run out of gas?  Speaking as someone who grew up on the old 60's Star Trek, then the first few films, and then eventually the new television series, I've been pleased with the overall longevity of the franchise, even if the individual parts that make up its whole are not always what I'd like them to be.  I could live with this franchise being put out to pasture, as it seems all good things must truly end sooner or later.  Especially if the future of Star Trek is as forgettable as Nemesis, better to let it die with honor than live on its knees, begging for an audience.",1078790400,10,3491,4.637987012987013
1464492,4,B00005JLRT,"I have a confession to make. I have to turn in my Trekkie credentials. It took me two years to watch the last Star Trek film, Insurrection. Now, it's taken me almost that long to watch the latest (and probably last) Trek movie, Nemesis. I hang my head in shame...
Last night, though, I rectified that by watching it on DVD. Was it worth the wait? Was it worthy of the name Star Trek? How did our illustrious Enterprise crew acquit themselves? And just what is it with bald men in the 24th century? The answers to all of these questions is: yes, yes, reasonably well, and bald is sexy (not to me, of course, but some women seem to like it). It's probably the second best Next Generation movie out there, after First Contact. It's a bit rough around the edges, a bit ""been there, done that,"" but overall it's entertaining.

When I first heard about Nemesis, my first thought was: COOL!! ROMULANS! Then, I watched this movie, and was a bit disheartened. There were hardly any Romulans in it! Instead, Nemesis introduces the Remans, a slave race from the Romulans' sister planet, who have decided that they've had enough. The make-up for the Remans was really cool, but I want my Romulans!!! I had to make do with a couple of iffy military types, Donatra and Suran (Dina Meyer and Jude Ciccolella). They got a few lines (Meyer more than Ciccolella), were able to sound suitably haughty, but that was about it. Neither had the chance to really stretch themselves (though Meyer was able to sport some interesting green bruises on her face when her ship was damaged).
A lack of pointy-eared enemies was not my only problem with this movie, however. The whole android sub-plot with B4 seemed shoehorned into the film. Yes, he is part of Shinzon's plan, but it just seemed like an excuse to get Spiner some more screen time and to give Data and Picard a way off of Shinzon's ship. While the whole B4 sequence can be defended, the execution of how they find him was ludicrous. It smacked of ""we're 30 minutes into the film and we haven't had an action sequence! Quick, go find Michael Bay!"" The whole dune buggy chase scene was completely ridiculous. The ""inventive"" way that they are able to escape was even more ridiculous (it's hard to be more than completely ridiculous, but this sequence manages it). Not to mention that it's against Starfleet policy of interfering with a pre-warp civilization. Just imagine what would happen if, in the early 20th century, a bunch of US soldiers were chasing a car and that car jumped into a floating spacecraft and took off. What would be the reaction? Yet our intrepid crew ignore other possibilities (sure, transporting a crew down there might leave them stranded, but how about beaming the sources of the signals up instead?).
My final complaint (just to get them all out of the way) is the fact that most of this stuff has been done before in Trek. Sure, there hasn't been a clone of one of the major characters done before, but the issues explored (identity, nature vs nurture, etc) have been. Nemesis seems like a souped-up Toyota Tercel. Sure, it's a sleek looking, motor-revving Tercel, but the old Tercel was just as good and besides, it's still a Tercel! Give me something new with my extra money.
After all that, you'd expect me to give this movie a really low rating. Right? Ok, no fair...the rating is at the top of the review so you've already seen it. 4 stars? Really? Why? It's simple. I was entertained by Nemesis and I love these characters. Patrick Stewart is simply wonderful with the material he's given. Tom Hardy makes a pretty good adversary for him, and I didn't have much trouble feeling like this was a Picard who had a horrible upbringing and is ready to lash out at everybody. He has the same sense of drama as Picard can have at times. Brent Spiner folds himself in his Data persona but also does a wonderful job with the nave B4 (despite the fact that I don't think he was necessary). The other regulars don't get a lot of screen time, but they are also perfectly in character and bring a warm, cozy feeling to the whole thing (though I don't think Sirtis did the greatest job in the mind-rape scene).
The special effects and the battle choreography were probably the best I've seen in a Trek movie. Everything had a greenish tinge, which matches with the greenish look that the Romulans have. I thought that was a nice touch. The collision of starships was simply brilliant (it's a wonder what you can do with computers!). By battle choreography, I'm speaking of the starship battles. I couldn't believe it when they all actually moved in 3 dimensions. Other than Wrath of Khan (where they make special mention of it), no other Trek movie (and only an episode or two that I can think of) has actually had ships zooming in different directions, over and under ships, etc. Everything's always been in two dimensions, and it's been annoying. It was a wonder to see in this case.

All in all, I found Nemesis to be an entertaining time-waster, even more so if you're already a Trek fan and have something invested in the characters. It felt nice to see old friends again. If I wasn't a Trek fan, this would probably be only 3 stars (or maybe even 2), but since I enjoyed it, I'll be generous.

1464553,1,B00005JLRT,"I really wanted to like this film. I really did. That's why it hurts so much to have to write this. But I must warn others. Do not see this film. I remember the excitement I felt when I discovered this film was going to be released. Alas.
There are possible spoilers below, so beware.
The film starts pleasantly enough, with Riker's wedding to Troi after showing trouble in the midst of the Romulan government. Wesley Crusher is finally given his due screen appearance. He is as gorgeous as always. I know that they cut out an entire 45 minute segment featuring him, which I was unhappy to hear.
Next, the Trek crew finds scans indicating posotronic activity on a planet, so they go to investigate, finding parts to an android almost identical to Data. They land on a desert planet and Picard acts completely unlike his character. The reserved French captain is now a high testosterone mini-dimensional fun lovin' bad cop kind of guy roving through the desert in a Jeep/Hummer-esque vehichle. I can't quite grasp how Data could locate this new android if only the brain is posotronic, which has been hammered into our heads since the series began. But forget all the rules made so far. To quote the Fantasticks, this movie ""defies logic and achieves ignorance!"" In the desert the crew meets nasty creatures that look like copies of Max Shreck's 1922 Nosferatu. Of course the vehichles are equipped with laser cannons and such and much F/X money was spent making loud booms.
After this lame adventure, the new android is put together. It is Data's mentally disabled brother. Blah blah blah. We already did this. It would have been much more interesting to do exploration with the Lor character. Hmm.. imagine doing battle with Lor. At least THAT would be a match for the Trek crew. Anyway, the new android is called B4. How tacky. A very uninteresting subplot altogether.
The ""story"" continues, if you can call it that. We learn the Romulan senate has a new praetor, Shinzon. Jean Luc gets an awesome cameo from Janeway.  Next, the Enterprise-E visits Romulus, and of course war breaks out, blah blah blah.
**end of obvious spoilers you already figured out from the preview**
The villain, Shinzon is underdeveloped. The story is too. It felt like echoes of Wrath of Khan were bubbling here. This is the first Star Trek I've seen that was simply a lame battle scenario. Half of the movie was spent at war. It felt felt the Matrix Revolutions to me. Pointless one dimensional buildup and buildup, huge battles, but absolutely no pleasure or satifaction in any of it.
Star Trek has been great because each episode/movie dealt with a moral dilemma choice, well built characters and intriguing situations. This movie has none of that. It's just a big battle. If you like explosions and loud sound effects, this movie is for you. If not, beware. Characters are altered for no reason whatsoever. There is no real emotional buildup, just constant fighting, so the climax is boring and uninteresting. It feels like this is the end of Trek, which truly saddens me. It feels like Star Trek is trying to reinvent itself. It was fine before, people! That's why there is still a fan base! Even the music felt similar to the hokey music from the first season of TNG - even with those crappy 80s synth sounds. I cannot say enough: avoid this movie.

1464554,1,B00005JLRT,"I can only hope 'Star Trek' can't get any worse than this.  A recycled and dumbed-down plot stolen from Star Trek II fails to awe me as the TNG casts supposed final mission.
This movie blatantly defies the even-odd rule of Trek movies, therefore requiring the rule to be modified.  I suggest the following:
""While even-numbered Star Trek movies are inevitably better than odd-numbered ones, every fifth movie is terrible, regardless of numbering.""
Anyway, this movie has very few redeeming qualities.  The special effects are very good, though they obviously can't be the driving force behind a movie (this must've been what Berman was going for).  I've read that Paramount dropped ILM for this movie; and if so, another thing it has in common with Star Trek V.  Though in that case, the result was awful effects detracting even more from an awful movie.  In 'Nemesis', the effects were the only thing that kept me awake.
The actors seem bored, and I honestly can't blame them.  You'll be bored to, if you have the courage to sit through the disgrace in the first place.  If they'd wanted to kill off Data, they should've done it in 'First Contact', where his death would've had more meaning (saving humanity from the Borg as opposed to a perverted, dying megalomaniac with the brains of a peanut).  Overall, this movie is a terrible entry into the 'Star Trek' series, and I hope never to see it again.
If Paramount decides to do another one (which I very much doubt, given how much this one bombed), they should attempt to recapture the spirit of the previous Trek movies.  Nemesis seems as if it was made in a desperate attempt to appeal to an almost non-existant mainstream audience.  Unfortunately, due to the stigma attached to the 'Star Trek' franchise, this audience simply doesn't exist.  If Nemesis had been made as a generic sci-fi/action movie, it may have done better.

1464555,4,B00005JLRT,"The main disappointment for any fan of ST:TNG is that the movies seemed to progressively get away from what made the show so terrific: a real team feeling (unlike the classis Trek with its triumverate and then the supporting crew), a sense of balance between action and wit, and the much-improved Enterprise-D.  The movies became dark affairs, including the ship(s), bathed in shadows and appearing cavernous and unsavory.  Data and Picard took one stage and the rest of the crew did whatever they could.  The films of the new crew are good .. they just don't have what fans loved about the show.  NEMESIS is really dark and unsavory, but there is some balance, and the feel of the movie is almost operatic in consequence.  It's good (Tom Hardy as Shinzon is amazing)and it contains stuff you've never seen.  But it has that dark feeling that the show, even at its most daring, never had.  Really .. would you want to serve aboard that Enterprise?  It's like the Munster's house?  But give NEMESIS credit for making a movie that tries to be unique and thoughtful and exciting.  It achieves, but at the cost of sacrificing what was loved about TNG crew and its voyages.",1075680000,2,1168,4.681372549019608
1464556,1,B00005JLRT,"How to ruin Star Trek The Next Generation.
Firstly,ditch ILM despite all the good work that they did with the special effects of six other Star Trek film.
Secondly,make a mean spirited film where the cast are absolutely helpless against the opposition-Troi is helpless,Data is helpless,Picard loses a fight with a dying man,even the Enterprise is helpless. What was the point?
Thirdly,have a villian that is pathetic rather than villianous- Shinzon is a frustated virgin that perves on Troi and wants to rape her. THIS is Rick Berman's idea of a great villian?
Fourthly,make a Romulan film that isn't really about the Romulans. How dumb was that?
Fifth,have a pointless battle where the Enterprise's weapons have all the impact of raindrops on a window pane- splat,splat,splat,thereby making the ""battle"" pointless.
Sixth-have a clone of Picard that looks nothing like him,laughable stuff really.
Seventh-have the Enterprise run out of ammo after just one battle. This ship is supposed to have 250 photon torpedeos.
Eighth-Kill off Data without giving him a decent goodbye scene(as ST2 did with Spock).
Let me point out how dumb this movie's plot is-if it really is that easy to beam aboard an enemy ship,then why not just leave a bomb there?
When Rick Berman decided to remake ST2,he should have realised that ST2 refilmed it's ending to make it warmer and offer some hope. ST:Nemesis does not refilm and so has a cold and flat ending,a finale with no hope or charm. Data blown to bits,the end(a huge mistake).

In fact, just having the Romulans and Remans being the big baddies for this movie is a great change, as none of the previous Trek films have used the Romulans as the main villains. Even with STVI, while the Romulans were part of the evil plot, they weren't running the show. Nemesis makes for a nice change.

Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew take to the galaxy again on a diplomatic mission to initiate peace with the Romuluns. But upon arrival on the alien planet, the crew is faced with a threat that could lead to the Earth's destruction, and Picard meets his most dangerous adversary yet.
Review
Love them or hate them, the Next Generation crew are back for what may be their last voyage - though rumour has it there may be one last trip before their retirement so don't get too upset just yet.  Well not at least until you have seen the end of this film which features a departure of a key cast member.
So what of the film?  Well it being an even numbered release, number ten to be exact, it bodes well as they avoid the curse this time around and provide one their better films to date.
While its not as action packed as First Contact, there is still enough to wet many appetites & to be honest this as true to form as the quality episodes that the Next Generation produced towards the end of its seven year run on TV.  Nemesis provides enough intrigue and drama so as not to patronise its audience yet it doesn't go to far as to isolate anyone that doesn't know their tricorder from their transporter.
For the Trekkies out there this is the first time I can recall that we have seen the Romulun home world, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong.  Tom Hardy plays the villain of the piece, Shinzon a being that is a clone of Picard and indeed the nemesis of the film.  Yet the Captain is not the only one with an opposite in the film as Data discovers an earlier prototype of himself who is appropriately named B-4.  While the various back stories run parallel with the action, the main thrust of the narrative comes from the interaction of the two pairs, indeed the competition, love and the way in which Shinzon & Picard eventually despise one another provides so perfectly matched a delivery that you could be excused to think that these were relatives caught in a long running feud rather than something that has been artificially thrust into existence.
The Verdict
It may not be your first choice for a Friday night out but to be honest this far superior to many of the popcorn Sci Fi or Action flicks that have been on offer in your multiplex in the past few months.  It caters for both the fan and those that haven't seen Star Trek ever before.  This film is a pleasure to watch as it combines both the action and drama to a pitch that neither falters or leaves you wanting more.",1073433600,2,2500,4.349785407725322
1464621,2,B00005JLRT,"In more than twenty-five years of watching Trek, from childhood on, I have never been so disillusioned with the series. Never before have I been so ... frankly, bored. The Romulans are my favorite villains and were completely wasted here. I expect some Star Trek fans (the minority who feel it is wrong to criticize any Star Trek story, any time) to therefore find this review ""unhelpful,"" which is too bad - I cared very deeply for this series, and for many of the characters, but the actors seem tired.
Given time - and by that, I mean time away, with the franchise hibernating for a while, kind of like Disney and their ""vault"" for animation releases - Star Trek will probably come back and regain the love and loyalty of both diehard fans and the average person who enjoys these adventures. Star Trek can get away with being goofy or politically incorrect, then too politically *correct* - and still tell a classic tale. Having rewatched ""First Contact,"" it still holds up years later, marvelously, and the Borg are if anything more menacing than they were on the TV show. But now the series needs time off.
While this will probably antagonize Battlestar Galactica purists, I recommend tracking down some web-based interviews with Ronald D. Moore, who left Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and discussed very candidly the problems accumulating with Voyager, Enterprise and this movie, and how televised science fiction could grow. Even if you hate Moore's version of Galactica, that interview will help you appreciate the tensions that went into the most recent incarnations of Star Trek, and why so many ardent fans have stopped watching. For real entertainment, of course, you could just get ""First Contact"" or ""Wrath of Khan"".

1464622,3,B00005JLRT,"Remember the Star Trek - Next Generation episode in which the crew discovered, trapped on a remote installation, a ""double"" of Will Riker?  And this individual actually WAS Will Riker, who eight years previous had been on a mission there, and unknowingly had encountered some sort of ray that split him into two individuals, both the exact same person.  One Riker returned to the Enterprise and continued his career, and the other stayed trapped at the installation.
Eight years later, the Enterprise crew discovered him.  Effectively on vacation for eight years, he had not really grown any.  His career was in suspense -- while the other Riker had continued upward, and was now first mate of the Enterprise.  The relationship between Riker #1 and Deanna had cooled, but Riker #2 still cared for her, and proposed to her... but she refused, since her feelings for Will (either of them) had changed in eight years.  Riker #2 departed, and took up his middle name (Thomas) to distinguish himself from Riker #1 (Will).
Now, in this final Star Trek movie, Will Riker marries Deanna.  Don't you have to know that Riker #2 Thomas, still out there in the Federation somewhere, had to be majorly hacked off when he heard about that?  Riker #2 was the one whose feelings for Deanna had NOT changed, yet old Riker #1 ended up getting the girl.

1464627,4,B00005JLRT,"There are 36 dramatic situations in the known universe. Every plot is a variation on these 36 dramatic situations. The Greek playwrites came up with all of them and honed them to perfection. What does this have to do with Star Trek Nemesis? Well a lot, actually. It isn't a remake of Wrath of Khan. Certainly there are some basic plot similarities but these are mostly superficial. Thematically the film has less to do with Trek 2 than with Trek 8. So if there are 36 dramatic situations (and everything, remember, is a variation on these)and there are 10 Trek films, what is the likelihood that there could be some plot similarities? A whole lot actually and Trek 10 in my humble opinion does it better in some areas and, yes, a bit worse than Trek 2 in others. It's not the worst of the Trek franchise that a lot of Trekkers claim but it's not the best either. For the worst of the Trek films featuring the Next Gen, I'd recommend avoiding Generations which was like an episode of the series (not a particularly brilliant one I might add but average)inflated into an epic film for the big screen.

What does work in Nemesis works extremely well. Picard celebrates the end of an era with his crewmates as Troi and Riker get married. As if that wasn't enough change, Riker assumes command of another ship (the Titan)with Troi at his side. Commander Data finally moves up in rank (and does so without anyone dying)to second in command of the Enterprise.
After celebrating their wedding on Earth, Riker and Troi embark back to Troi's home world for a ceremony there aboard the Enterprise. En route to the planet Betazoid, the crew picks up a signal that could only be from a positronic brain like Data's. Intrigued, the crew go to this planet unsure of what they will find. It's pretty darn close to the Neutral Zone so Riker, still Picard's right hand man, suggests caution. They discover another of Data's long lost relatives in the process.
Meanwhile, Star Fleet has received a communication from the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire. They've requested a Star Fleet representative come to Romulus immediately. Since the Enterprise is the closest ship available, Picard and crew are sent there where there are a number of surprises awaiting them.
Contrary to a previous review, the acting is solid throughout and hangs in there with some of the best in the Next Gen film series. I'm rather surprised that the director Stuart Baird elected not to reintegrate any of the cut sequences for the film. They would have actually strengthened the narrative and explained a lot (for example, why Worf was on the Enterprise after being appointed to a position on Klingon. Turns out the diplomatic life wasn't for him. That line of dialog was lost during the cutting phase of the film). The cut sequences consisted of interesting character moments and revealed quite a bit about Picard, his feelings about meeting Shinzon the new Praetor of Romulus.
My suggestion--give Nemesis a chance. It's an entertaining film that has a number of marvelous battle sequences and some nicely nuanced acting from the Trek veterans. While the pacing is a bit sluggish at times, the overall pace of the film actually helps the film achieve some of its thematic gravity and momentum. I'd also suggest lightening up a bit here--it's a film in a franchise series that attempts to entertain while examining a number of interesting themes (whether our decisions create who we are or if we are just a victim of circumstance and formed by these very circumstances).
The visuals are top notch. I had my reservations about the digital visuals used in the film (actually it began as far back as First Contact where the Enterprise was a virtual Enterprise and not a model) but I've been proven wrong. They look impressive and there are visuals that couldn't have been accomplished with models and animation that are accomplished here.
After 72 episodes of the original series, over 100 episodes of the Next Generation, ten feature films (not to mention the spin-off series DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all the novels spun off from the various series), sooner or later there was bound to be a dramatic situation that was repeated. It happened before (during Next Gen and the other series). I'm not quite sure what some fans were expecting but Nemesis is a fine (but far from perfect) addition to the Trek films.
 Remember, next time you think you've seen that plot before, you probably have so be kind in your judgment. Nobody has had any success coming up with a 37th dramatic situation yet and until they do, we're stuck with those same 36 over and over and over again. Remember, it's not the situation but the telling that really matters. With Nemesis, Baird, writer Logan and the veteran Trek cast turn an eye to the difficulty of being closer to the end than beginning. Nemesis touches on a number of emotional issues that will eventually face all of us and does so with candor, wit and grace.",1072051200,3,4959,4.745075318655852

1464630,3,B00005JLRT,"There is a lot of merit to Star Trek: Nemesis.  As a fan of the original show, I always approached TNG films with skepticism.  First Contact was, of course, the pinnacle of this series, and I (unlike many ST fans) really enjoyed ST:Generations.  Insurrection was a definite turn for the worse, and I expected little of Nemesis.  Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed the film, in spite of its many shortcomings.  It's certainly better than Insurrection, for example.
The good points: it's pacing and action are fantastic.  Director Baird is a respected action film editor, and the pacing and feel of the film is pitch-perfect.  The performances in TNG have always been uneven - Frakes and Sirtis, for example, cannot match the presence of Patrick Stewart - but the acting is uniformly equal to or better than any of the previous TNG outings.  There are Romulans - everyone loves the Romulans!  Finally, in spite of what others have written, the highlight of the film is the crewmember's death (I won't say whose, in case you haven't seen it) - it is startling in its speed and very effective due to the quick cutting.  The denouement following the death is short, but every bit as effective as Spock's in TWOK.
Unfortunately, there are a number of bad points.  As pointed out by others, the story itself is essentially recycled from The Wrath of Khan, and that makes it feel tired and dull.  Worse still, there are logical holes - where does Shinzon find this B-4 prototype of Data? how did the Romulans get Picard's DNA?  what has happened to the Federation head spy to Romulus (Mr. Spock)? why doesn't Troy sense Shinzon's lies? (there is an explanation in the cut scenes, but the actual movie ignores the issue.)  Even more annoying are the glaring and unecessary scientific errors.  I don't mind when Star Trek invents science to explain itself (transporters, shields, etc.), but I really mind it when they make scientific errors for no reason.  The explanation of the Reman weapon is particularly laughable - no electromagnetic radiation could have the properties ascribed to it, it's a physical impossibility.  Likewise, you don't need an android to generate positronic radiation - any idiot with a nuclear reactor (or a particle accelerator) can do that.  And don't get me started on the aftermath of the collision between the Enterprise and the Scimitar!  Newton is rolling in his grave.  The point is, all of these mistakes were unnecessary - B-4's planet was proto-industrial, so positronic radiation would be anomalous anyways; Data's spacewalk could still have been necessary if the two ships were still attached; and there's no reason the Reman weapon had to be ""electromagnetic"" - it could have been any kind of energy!
The average moviegoer is likely to forgive the defects in physics, but less likely to forgive the plot holes.  However, most of these you don't notice while watching the first time, because you're caught up in the action.  It's on reflection afterwards that such thorny issues appear.
This DVD is crammed full of extras, and I wonder how they all fit on one disc!  There are some little minidocumentaries that are fun and interesting, cut scenes, etc.  The director's commentary is somewhat dull, but there's some interesting info in there.  All this is stuffed on without (apparently) sacrificing the quality of the feature - it is clean, crisp, and sounds great.",1071360000,3,3409,4.907504363001745
1464661,2,B00005JLRT,"What a disappointment. Let me tell you that I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and that I think TNG is the core of the whole Star Trek universe. I've seen every TNG episode several times and loved the series for its philosophy, its actors, and its emotional factor.
Yet with Nemesis, everything is destroyed. You know, Generations was very good. First Contact was excellent. Insurrection was not so bad after all. But entry #10 is a disgrace for the franchise, battling with ""The Final Frontier"" and ""The Motion Picture"" for the title ""Worst Trek Movie Ever"".
Dear Lord, Star Trek isn't about space battles, evil aliens and blowing things up. It's about exploration of space and mankind, carried by good dialogue, good ideas, and good acting. Unfortunately, the people at Paramount don't seem to share that view.
They promised us a ""Generation's Final Journey""; a final journey for our beloved characters - Fine. The opening scene at the wedding even is quite touching. However, after this, everything wents downhill very fast. The boring and senseless Data subplot begins (Lore, anyone?), totally disregarding the emotion chip from Generations and First Contact. Worf's role has been reduced to that of a clown, getting sick of Romulan Ale and being concerned of showing up nude at a Betazed wedding. This character's main attributes used to be honor, valor, justice, and a constant struggle between Human and Klingon culture. Not so in Nemesis.
Worf? Wait a second... Worf? What is doing there anyway? Didn't the people at Paramount watch the ending of DS9? Why is Worf suddenly back on the Enterprise? Geez, that's the opposite of character development, really. In First Contact, Worf's appearance didn't feel forced at all. It was logical for him to fight there with the Defiant and being beamed aboard the Enterprise. In Nemesis, we don't even get to hear an explanation (I know, I should be grateful for this, since the explanation would have been hilarious anyway.)
Beverly, Riker and Geordi get nothing to do throughout the rest of the film. At least Deanna gets more screen time this time. As for Picard, his role is saved only by Stewart's brilliant acting, though Stewart obviously has a hard time fighting against the awful script. And THIS was the last time I've seen my beloved characters? Not how I had once pictured it. What a way to kill of my TNG crew.
The plot is essentially... well, boring. What do they fight for anyway? It all bodes down to killing the villain. Boy, they had the Romulans and did nothing with them. Instead, they invent another new redundant alien race. How imaginative. Besides, what about the Romulans from the series? They don't even mention Sela or Tomalak. Another huge disappointment for the fans.
In my phantasy, I picture an alternate Star Trek 10... The true ending of a generation, involving Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and Vulcans. Perhaps a fight for peace in the quadrant, a fight for Earth, for Starfleet and the Federation. A new era of Star Trek. Something revolutionary. Important roles for every member of the cast. Much nostalgy, cameos for Sela, O'Brien, Ro Laren, and Pulaski perhaps? Continuity with the TV epsiodes and previous movies, Worf being Klingon ambassador, Data having emotions, and so on. A big epos combined with something imagantive and groundbreaking... like the invention of Warp 10 or anything. *sigh* Unfortunately, this is all just a dream now, and it won't happen anymore. Nemesis has absolutely nothing of what I just tried to describe. Nothing. It leaves you with such an empty feel in your stomache you almost want to cry.
I give it the second star only because non-fans will probably like the movie a bit more, because the special effects are good, because of the DVD extras, and because Goldsmith's score is very nice as well (albeit a bit repetitive, isn't it?). Actually, I'd like to remove 1/2 stars for the infamous dune buggy scene (in which Picard consciously violates the Prime Directive for no obvious reason), but Amazon only allows full stars, so...

1464663,4,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis, the 10th (and possibly final) feature film based on Gene Roddenberry's seminal science fiction TV franchise, isn't as bad a Trek film as some would lead one to believe.  Sure, it isn't as good or satisfying as Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, but then again that film had Nicholas Meyer at the helm, which gave the Original Series' cast a worthy farewell.
Noted film editor-turned-director Stuart Baird isn't Nick Meyer, who gave his two Trek chapters its clever mix of Horatio-Hornblower-in-the-stars, literary allusions (Dickens and Melville in The Wrath of Khan and Shakespeare in The Undiscovered Country) and some outsider's irreverence to counter the first, flawed Star Trek film's pondering pretentions of grandeur.  But as a Trek outsider, Baird attempts to tell a dramatic tale which pits Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the Enterprise-E crew against Shimzon (Tom Hardy), a human who has been a slave on the Romulans' sister planet Remus and has become Praetor of the Romulan Empire in a deadly coup d'etat.  Cunning, ruthless and brimming with resentment, Shimzon is not only a fierce warrior and a veteran of the Dominion War, he's also Picard's clone.
For all its perceived flaws, Nemesis somehow plays better on the small screen than it does in the multiplex. It feels more natural watching this at home on a DVD player; screenwriter John Logan is an admitted Star Trek fan and blended elements from Star Trek II (which this movie's plot bears a similarity to in various respects) with an above-average Data-and-Picard episode from The Next Generation.  After all, Nemesis revolves around Picard and Data (Brent Spiner, who, with Logan and producer Rick Berman, co-wrote the story); each finds a mirror image of himself -- Picard/Shimzon and Data discovers his flawed prototype B-4 -- and each is forced to deal with his ""evil"" twin.
At the heart of the story, Nemesis is also about family and the many transitions families go through in life. We first see the Enterprise family celebrating the long-awaited ""conjugation"" between Cmdr. William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and ship's Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), who, like children leaving home for college, are leaving the Enterprise for the USS Titan, Riker's first command.  We follow the crew on this final trek across the stars, only to watch as they mourn the loss of a cherished comrade.
Star Trek: Nemesis' special effects are excellent, and Baird's experience as both an editor (Superman: The Movie) and director gives the action sequences a kinetic energy absent from the previous film, Insurrection.  The score by noted composer Jerry Goldsmith is also outstanding.  (Brent Spiner fans who know the actor is also a gifted singer should find his rendition of Irving Berlin's ""Blue Skies"" as a very enjoyable bonus.)
The Paramount Widescreen Collection DVD is above average considering it's not a 2-disc ""Collector's Edition."" It not only has a crisp digital transfer and clear sound, but it has audio commentary by Baird, deleted scenes and a handful of ""making-of"" documentaries.",1068940800,5,3097,5.169660678642715

The plot-twists, if they can even be called that, are predictable and downright ridiculous at times. Not worth your money....not worth your time.

1464666,5,B00005JLRT,"Yes, I did give this movie five stars. And considering all of the bad reviews I have read, I will probably be taken to task for it.

 So let me start by saying that I am, at heart, an unabashed ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" fan. I have been a fan of TNG since I started watching the TV series towards the end of the first season, and it would take quite a bit for me to be offended, dismayed, or even truly disappointed with the series.

 That being said, I also have to state that this movie is far from perfect. But I'll get to that in a moment.

 ""Star Trek - Nemesis"" is somewhat of an update of the original series ""Wrath of Khan"" movie. There are many similarities between the two. Considering that the previous movie is deemed by most Star Trek fans to be the best of the movie franchise, it is understandable why many were unhappy with this latest effort.

 However, there are differences. And it is these differences that set the movie apart, in my opinion, from its predecessor.

 Answering the Romulans latest call for peace, Captain Picard comes face to face with his clone, Shinzon. While Captain Picard has had a life full of opportunity, Shinzon has had a life full of slavery. These two men, identical DNA wise, have paved out different paths for their lives. Jealous, Shinzon has set out to destroy Picard first, and all of Earth second.

 As has always been with the Star Trek franchise, the special effects were terrific, escalating with the battle of Picard's and Shinzon's ships.

 ""Nemesis"" was made with the thought that it would be the final TNG movie (signing of the cast has been more and more difficult with each movie). As a result, the intention was to bring some closure to the cast of caracters. (Basically, it was made for TNG fans only. Non-TNG fans will not like this movie, as they will be lost from the very beginning.) While their intentions were good, someone was obviously asleep at the wheel during the writing and shooting of this storyline.

 The biggest story goof was with Wesley Crusher and Worf. Would someone please explain to me why they were wearing Starfleet uniforms? Wesley dropped out of Starfleet during season 7 to learn from the Traveler, while Worf left Starfleet to help with the rebuilding of the Klingon homeworld at the end of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine."" At no time during the movie were explanations given about this. To non-fans, this may seem petty, but to fans continuity has always been one of the shows biggest strengths.

 As I stated at the beginning, I am an unabashed TNG fan. And overall, I believe ""Nemesis"" to be a fitting send-off for this crew.",1067299200,3,2625,4.560767590618337
1464667,2,B00005JLRT,"Consider the vastness of the following Star Trek plot:  A demented, super intelligent madman has seized power.  The madman has a very powerful weapon that could be used to destroy a planet.  He hates the captain of the U. S. S. Enterprise.  A major character dies at the end of the end of the film saving the Enterprise and her crew.
 You know what movie I am talking about don't you?  Of course, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan.  Right?  Wrong!  I am talking about Star Trek: Nemesis.  This ill conceived, asinine remake of the classic Khan movie is both an insult to the franchise and the fans alike.  Please don't confuse my indignation for a total dislike of the film.  It does have some merit.  It has cool ships, cool special effects, an excellent ""ramming"" scene and good acting by most of the characters.  However, I think that the franchise has lost its way among the cogs and wheels of the cash machine.  I went to see this movie with little hope and expecting nothing.  I got pretty much what I expected.  The Next Generation, other than First Contact hasn't translated to the big screen very well.  It sickens me to no end to see something that I love reduced to the pile of scrap it is now.
Why oh why don't they let Jonathan Frakes hold the reigns of The Next Generation for a while?  Paramount and Rick Berman certainly have no clue how to deliver what the fans truly want.
 The power of The Wrath of Khan is insulted at best and diminished at worst by Nemesis.  In The Wrath of Khan when Spock died we all felt it.  It was a scene of power and full of emotion.  The exchange between Kirk and Spock is timeless and a beautiful example of the friendship that the two shared.  When Data saves Picard in Nemesis there is no exchange of emotion.  There is no power. There is only a ""too late"" goodbye delivered by Data.  The scene is drug out unnecessarily long to ""build tension.""  I was about as tense as I am in a hot tub.  I was not moved to tears.  I was not moved at all.  The movie does salvage some of its dignity at the end when the magnificent 7 now ""6"" stand around and lament for their lost friend.  The worst acting in the movie is here though.  Troy's tears do not convince me.  At least Riker gets his own ship FINALLY.
 In short, the Star Trek franchise has delivered a spoon-fed, thoughtless movie that stands on the pillars of former greatness.  I love these characters.  I hate to see them put into a spot that does not do them justice.  The cast members even seemed less than excited about the film.  Jonathan Frakes seemed disgusted or at least discouraged by the process.  Patrick Stewart saw a good paycheck.  Brent Spiner saw a chance to take care of his character finally.  I agree with his reasons, but I would like to have seen a bit more emotion behind it.  If there is another Next Generation movie, here is what I purpose.  Let Frakes direct it, and get someone in the writing community that has a true understanding and love for the franchise to write it.  I can think of many who could have done better than this...Straczynski, Ellison, me...  And of course one final note about the movie...I give them credit for not using any time traveling.  We are all sick of that.  I just hope that Berman and his lackeys can come up with something better in the future or else Star Trek may fall into the category of ""It was once great, but now it isn't worth the price of admission.""",1066953600,61,3414,4.346031746031746

The sad thing is it managed to edge out Insurrection from the bottom three. I can't imagine that they'll make another Star Trek movie after two bombs in a row and the latest series reeling (which I've also stopped watching). Now you may think I'm not a Star Trek fan but my favorite episode aired the day I was born, I watched Star Trek in german without knowing the language when I was five, and I'm slowly buying up the DS9 seasons as I can afford them.

2. No character I could recognize. Data seemed to be the only one that showed up, and they killed him for it!
3. I LIKE WESLEY CRUSHER! So there! I hoped his deleted scene would be on the DVD but alas Wes fans lost AGAIN!
4. Where the hell was Troi and Bev at? For that matter where was Geordi?
5. Riker=Kirk.
6. This is a PRIME example as to why a director and writer SHOULD BE A FAN OF THE SERIES! Gotta know what you're talking about. Stuart Baird directing ST? NOT!!! I would have a better chance of bringing peace to the Mid East, before he got ST right!
7. STAR WARS SUX! Unfortunatly the bushy brains behind this mid-air collison must be RABID fans of Lucas and Co.
8. The MUSIC BLEW COWPIES! Right in my ear!! Took over an hour to wash the BS out!
9. The Enterprise herself. The LCD monitors gave a very old ENT feel to the ship. Was it just me or did they change the scale of the ship? I read on the ST website that the Simitar was over 900 meters(2952 ft) in length. The Enterprise is just over 600M (1980ft) but when seen in close proximity, the Enterprise ""grows"" almost a thousand feet!
10. RICK BERMAN! MAKE A TRUE STTNG FILM PLEASE!!!!!!!!

I left the theater feeling like my friends had long since left.
I remember one late Sunday evening in September of 1987, I had just started High School and Star Trek was back. I had seen every one of the TOS episodes, all the movies (4 then)and was hungry for more. During my High School career, I was late MANY a Monday moring, as TNG was aired at 11PM.
I fell completeley in love with Marina, and the Galaxy Class Enterprise. They both should have been in this film. Thank you Brannon Braga or Ronald Moore or WHOEVER in thier infinite stupidity detroyed the ship at Veridian III!
All the TNG movies have left me wanting. Even First Contact, (ANTOHER example of writers block for a title, remember Riker getting it on with that HOT little alien...Oh never mind! This is a Family Website!)left me wodering who was in charge? TNG needs a REAL GOOD ENDING. Not this crap that was released.

1464719,2,B00005JLRT,"The art and music of this movie are really objectionable. The bridge is very cluttered and old-fashioned looking, clearly infected by ""Enterprise"" art concepts, leading one to believe that the technology of Picard's time has actually gone backward! I love ""Enterprise"" for what it is: a nostalgic look at the old days. But completely inappropriate to let the art direction of that series have such influence here.
The music in the beginning is cheaply melodramatic and really grates.
The overall effect is one of a show that has sacrificed the smooth, high-tech appearance that we have come to know as ""Next Gen"" in favor of an appearance that was out-of-date when Kirk was alive. Bad move.
The plot is inherently good, but poorly executed. Both the location of the final battle and the way it ends lack meaning. Having said that, the battle itself is quite interesting. Also, the lines given to the Romulan commander at the end of this movie are so inappropriately saccharine and phony as to defy belief.
It is also both true and sad that, as another reviewer noted, the ending of this movie completely invalidates the ending of the TV series, which ending was a vastly superior piece of work.
Final conclusion: go ahead and buy it for the extras, but the movie will disappoint. Too much ""Enterprise"", not enough ""Next Gen"".",1065398400,,1325,4.841409691629956
1464720,2,B00005JLRT,"I consider myself a true Star trek fan. I have followed to evolution of the series ever since i started to watch television (about 25 years ago). I always have seen it as more than an entertaining show but as a way of projecting my mind into the imagination. I have found this in every episode, some more than others. Even Insurrection is very exciting although poor in some aspects. But Nemesis is the worst possible contribution to the whole experience. As a Star Trek fan I can't help but watching it over and over again, and to look for something that will change my mind but I always come back to the conclusion that it is the most stupid story of all. There is no subplot, unless you consider B-4 a new story. The Picard revealing of his innerself is so weak and boring that I feel regret of ever admiring the man. There are so many plot sequences that are completly irrelevant that slows the story and action sequences that are plain dumb. I give it a second star because of the visual effects but I would prefer Star Trek V anytime.
About the DVD edition, you can enjoy more the plot after watching the deleted scenes, especially about the Reman and Romulan alliance and their plans. But the audio commantary is only informative in a technical level and it doesn't enhance your perception at all about the story. And the interviews are too positive and fake.
Nemesis ultimatly kills TNG and dosen't give me any hope about new Star Trek devellopments. It seems that Star Trek has become a buraucratic empire who doesn't offer more than American Junk culture and is out there just to try to compete with those horrible new Star Wars movies and to make a few bucks.
I wonder what happened to Ronald D. Moore, Michael Piller, Branon Braga and those who brought an ounce of vision to Star Trek.",1064793600,3,1797,4.4984709480122325
1464721,2,B00005JLRT,"I am a bigtime Trek fan, so bear with me. I've seen every TNG episode multiple times, and the final TV episode ranks up their with the best television I've ever seen.
But this film, despite moments of excellence, is a turkey. I rented the DVD, and was so peeved at various parts, including, in particular, the ludicrous (and unfaithful to longtime viewers) ending, that I immediately rewatched several extremely annoying scenes with the director's commentary with my wife. Our mutual thought: What were they thinking?
Fans have invested a lot into these characters, and it would not be a bad trek move to kill them off -- if it meant something. This end was so lame that it had us wondering ""he died for that?!"" It was as if a garden-variety blown fuse had electrocuted Geordi. And, it invalidates the final TV episode (Arggh!).
The movie does get two stars, only because the basic plot itself is simply brilliant -- that a clone of Picard, with a far different childhood -- turns into a monster capable of ultimate evil. It could have been high concept Hollywood at its best. The actor who plays Picard's clone gives a fascinating, poignant and very cool performance that nearly rescues this wreck of a movie. Picard, as always, is superb, but he's stuck with C-grade lines too much of the time. All of the other characters are in some sort of fog, including Data. Many of the named cast (Dr. Crusher, anyone), are nearly written out of the script. And, in the worst Trek tradition, the cheese factor on some of the special effects and fight scenes is simply Velveeta. The scenes on Romulus include laughably bad sets...
Bottom line: There is a reason why this Trek is so cheap on DVD and the TV episodes so pricey. Go buy ""All good things..."" on DVD, and revisit the magic that has so tragically gone out of this series that had been so dear to me, and let this turkey lie.",1064793600,4,1875,4.566765578635015

1464723,2,B00005JLRT,"I must've seen a different film from what some folks have written about here.  The Next Gen crowd is always fun to watch, but ""Nemesis"" was BAD.  I don't own the DVD, and I don't plan to, even though I own a copy of Star Trek V, which was just plain awful.  (Nothin' but love for ya, Bill, but that was a stinker.)
If you want a cool, interesting plot, this is NOT the film for you.  In fact, if you want a plot at all, this isn't the film for you.  There is something resembling a plot, but it may have been a cast-off episode for Leave it to Beaver.  This film just made no sense.  How has Shinzon lived this long without Picard's blood?  Makes no sense.  Why is there only one of those individual transporter gadgets?  Makes no sense.  Why is Riker having a knife fight ON the Enterprise, without a phaser, by himself?  Why don't they use the transporters to capture and subdue the intruder?  Makes no sense.  There are, indeed, acts of tremendous valor, but EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS POINTLESS.  You get the feeling watching the cast that they're hoping the next scene will provide some explanation of where this film is going (sorry gang, never happens.)
Finally, let's talk for a moment about the space battles.  The writers, director and production crew went back to what has become a staple of the Next Gen movies: let's blow up the Enterprise.  They crashed the Enterprise D.  They had the self-destruct set to pop in ""First Contact"" (which other than that cliche' was a fine film).  I have tried to block ""Insurrection"" out of my memory.  Maybe they blew up the ship then too, I don't want to remember.  They shoot the Enterpise to bits in this one for no discernable reason.
You know, Roddenberry had a concept about a future where humanity was struggling to better itself.  In Picard's best moments, he embodies that.  Kirk did, too (we've got a million years of savage blood on our hands, but we're not going to kill TODAY!"")  However, the entire franchise has gotten away from thoughtful science fiction and has turned into just another shoot 'em up.  The last two Trek films were no better than ""Wing Commander"" or the last ""Godzilla"" remake.  Don't even get me started on what the ""Trek Killers"" of Berman and Co. are doing with the ""Enterprise"" series.  Ugh.
Khan is great sci-fi in general, not just great Trek.  The Voyage Home was fun.  I personally think Star Trek VI was the best of all the films, because there were almost no space battles.  The one at the end was quick and purposeful, and the lion's share of the film is spent with the characters figuring out an interstellar conspiracy.  Heavens, a plot.  What an unusual thing.
Why can we not ask for more from good sci-fi?  This franchise has the support to pull it off, but the powers that be are intent on killing it.  Between the horror of ""Phantom Menace"" (somewhat redeemed by ""Attack of the Clones"") and ""Nemesis,"" our two most successful, most beloved franchises meandered off into irrelevance.  I can only hope there's someone with a fresh idea out there now.  Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith, James Cameron?  Are you listening?  Save us!",1064102400,4,3119,4.543165467625899
1464724,4,B00005JLRT,"I have been going over the comments left by most reviewers about Nemesis and being another die-hard Trekkie, I'll voice my two cents worth.
I think some of the allegations against the last installment for the TNG movie series are not fair. The biggest one floating around is that the plot is a rip-off of The Wrath Of Khan. I don't think that is necessarily true. I agree that it does inspire some dj vu but that hardly constitutes a true rip-off. There were tremendous similarities between the production and scene sequences of The Terminator and its sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day; did anyone accuse T2 of being a rip-off of T1? T2 was a blockbuster. Similarly, Nemesis is a pretty good movie and it is not fair to forcibly compare it to The Wrath Of Khan. If you are a die-hard Trekkie, you might very well appreciate the similarity instead.
If you critique the movie beside itself, you could say that the movie was too ""Data""-centered perhaps. Some characters, like La Forge, Worf or Dr. Crusher, did appear to be more of filler roles and did not get as much airtime and stronger lines as we would have liked. The production and effects were very good. The evolution of the characters themselves was excellent; the acting was superb. Picard was a bit on the mushy side but if you think in a frame of reference where they've become a family that has been together on a starship for 15 years, you begin to appreciate this side of his character and why it is so. Brent Spiner's acting was nothing short of fantastic; whoever did his script also did an excellent job along with the direction. Brent Spiner did justice to the role of Data. You could see the human evolution coming through in the android's personality over 15 years; the subtle smiles and winks in certain scenes, the smart jives and one-liners. He depicted just the right tones of humanness while retaining the rigidity of his android reality, which culminates in the ultimate (human) sacrifice in the end - a paradox carried out to perfection. The ending was bittersweet, which is what I personally liked.
All in all, it wasn't based on a strong standalone plot irrespective of the characters like ""First Contact"" was. ""Nemesis"" has a character-centric plot more like ""Generations"" did. That is probably the reason why people are so divided about liking it - you have to know the TV series and follow character evolutions there else you cannot fully enjoy a movie based on it; you lose the essence somewhere and then brand the movie as being bad. If you are a die-hard Trekkie or a fan of TNG, I think you'll be able to see beyond any weaknesses and read between the lines to appreciate the finer points of the movie and still enjoy it - including the dj vu element with The Wrath Of Khan.
As for the DVD, it is produced very well and contains lots of goodies, like commentaries, production notes and deleted scenes. It is worth adding to your Star Trek collection, if you have one. Cheers.",1064102400,2,2960,4.618595825426945
1464725,2,B00005JLRT,"I love Star Trek, but the director and Piller are at fault here.  Someone got the notion that they should go examine every other film that came before this one, and STEAL one good element from each of them, and make this mess.  The actors were walking through this film, just going through the motions.  I've worked in film, and have studied films for a long time, and it was obvious to me that the actors KNEW they were making a load...  As a viewer, and fan, you'll find yourself repeatedly thinking ""I've seen this before"" (because you HAVE), right down to the little unneccessary Jeep ride through the desert, reminiscent of the idiotic horsie-rides that Bill Shatner provided for us in a worse mess called Star Trek V.  THE DIRECTOR STUNK AND THE ACTORS PUT UP WITH IT AND IT SHOWS!  Picard freezing up like a tired old fool, right at the END when he's in a pinch? NONSENSE, this was completely out of character, as most of the characterizations were throughout this debacle.  Deanna Troi, a simpering, wimpering mess? BEEE-ESSSS!!  And hey, WE'VE SEEN DATA'S HEAD ON THE GROUND BEFORE!  Will Riker in a fight scene IDENTICAL to the falling scaffold scene that killed Kirk in Generations, right down to the rivets popping out of the walls? WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE THINKING??  Jeez.... I wish they hadn't done this.
Can I mention the blaring errors in continuity, right from the start?  RENT this thing, and in the opening scenes from the wedding (the scene was actually pretty good) you get to watch Wesley Crusher mysteriously seated at the wedding party head-table, wearing a uniform (didn't he become an intergalactic disembodied entity after leaving Star Fleet?) and aside from the fact that he gets not a mention, he keeps APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING depending on the angle of the shot!

Oh, and by the way... clones are a tired ""schtick"".

Perhaps, but overall, the outright thievery of plot elements from previous films is a sad disappointment, when there are so many other things they could've done.

1464726,2,B00005JLRT,"Following in the footsteps of recent Star Trek film DVD releases, Nemesis is packed with features (albeit on a single disc). For first time viewers I would advise watching the film before watching any of the featurettes, at least one contains major spoilers. In themselves the featurettes are interesting to watch but they don't add to the experience in any way. The deleted scenes are a mixed bag, some should have been retained in the film: Picard and Data after the wedding ceremony; Picard speaking to Beverly in sickbay; and Deanna in the turbolift. The ""original"" ending is awful and I'm grateful it ended up on the cutting room floor.
The picture quality is excellent, especially since a lot of the film features near-dark sets. The sound quality is very good. In all, an excellent transfer to DVD.
As to the film itself... The Next Generation is my favourite of the Star Trek shows (the original comes second). I was hooked from Encounter at Farpoint and have enjoyed all 7 seasons and the subsequent films. When I first heard about Nemesis I eagerly awaited this film - Romulans, a Khan-like foe for Picard, a script from one of the writers of Gladiator - wow!
It's the first of any of the films that really disappointed me when I saw it at the cinema. Nothing has changed now that I have seen it again on DVD. No matter what anyone else says, Nemesis does indeed rip off The Wrath of Khan - Shinzon is a product of genetic engineering, he has a powerful weapon in his possession that is deployed to devastating effect at the film's climax.
Sure, Patrick Stewart gets some wonderful moments in the film, but that's about it. The introduction of B4 serves little purpose other than to give Brent Spiner a new character. Troi's mental rape serves no purpose other than to act as a means by which Picard can finally strike back at Shinzon. The other members of the cast do get a look in but its almost as if they are playing different characters, never mind their shocking underuse. The fight between Riker and the Viceroy might have worked better and made more sense if it had been between Worf and the Viceroy.
Much as I want to see Star Trek 11 and for the series to continue, I am saddened that TNG has ended with a whimper. For me, Nemesis ranks tenth.

In order to appeal to a wide audience, there are certain things your movie must have.  Crazy action sequences with slow motion and car chases, gratuitous sex, whatever.  Basically all the things the Next Generation series never had.
What the writers/director of this movie don't seem to realize is that people who never liked Star Trek in the first place would probably not be lured to see this because of the blockbuster cliches it employs; the biggest fans of the TV show will be the ones who see the movies.  But with this movie, many of the people who never cared about Star Trek will still not care about it, and many of the diehard TNG fans will feel like their favorite show sold out.  I'm part of the latter group.
I feel bad for the actors from the series, who had to act way out of character for much of it.  They did a good job with their roles, which is why I gave this two stars.  The movie was also fairly entertaining, loyal to the series or not.  But the movie is stupid.  It was nice that Riker and Troi got married in the beginning, but that served to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  Picard speeding around in the buggy was awful.  The sex scene between Riker and Troi was totally unnecessary (even though they did manage to fit the story into it- but they could've done it without the sex).  And I've never been big into Star Wars, but even I could recognize what action scenes they stole from it.
I wouldn't recommend paying to see this movie, but if you want something light and it happens to be on TV, it's worth a viewing I suppose.  I just wish it had better writing.",1062028800,,1718,4.314641744548287

I once heard there is nothing more desperate and hopelessly optimistic than a Cubs fan. But watching these movies, I have to think that anyone who wishes more than uninspired nonsense from the Trek camp is worse.",1061683200,2,626,5.087378640776699
1464753,1,B00005JLRT,"An incoherent plot, a vague theme, shallow characterization, laughable action cliches, an utter lack of Star Trek conventions or congruity with past Star Trek films, and even plagiarism from Star Wars (e.g., the ship hallway gunfight) and the Lord of the Rings (e.g., the self-impalement at the end and the music) cannot be forgiven. Much of this nonsense is explained by the director when, in the special features, he admits to never having seen the Star Trek T.V. series or films; the undue focus on Data at the expense of all of the other characters, meanwhile, can be explained by Brent Spiner's position as script writer. This installment is among the worst of the STNG movies. And if this is in fact the last with the Next Generation crew, it is an even greater disappointment. Don't waste your money on this DVD; save your money for one of the complete seasons of the STNG television series, when STNG was still STNG--original, noble, intelligent, thrilling, and delightful.",1061596800,5,981,4.9156626506024095

A couple of those scenes added back in, coupled with a more emotional performance by Stewart, would have made this a fantastic TNG sendoff.  As it stands, the disc looks great, sounds great, and is just what you'd expect from a Trek film - it just isn't at the level of Trek II or Trek VI, or even First Contact.  The character development was a little lacking, and Stewart underplays Picard.  Otherwise a good, fun story that looks likely to be the final chapter of TNG.",1061596800,,625,4.456140350877193

1464757,4,B00005JLRT,"You could say Nemesis is a not-well-thought parody of ST2, and you could be possibly right, but the analogy serves for the moment, so I'll try to explain my feelings about this movie in that way. It begins with a remainder of our own temporal status in the universe: the Riker/Troi wedding is an exquisite way to tell us about family, friends and continuity. Just like in Khan Movie, Kirk's birthday reminds him about time and his friends remind him about family. That's a good and laughable moment (especially with Data's performance). and it is possible wedding... Worf married Troi in an ALTERNATE future, remember? Next, we encounter the nemesis element (ironic, but Khan's movie was about a ""Genesis"" project in the hands of a Nemesis character...) a weak plot? Don't think so. Picard is the captain of the most powerful starship of the fleet, the ""flagship"" of the Federation; it's the best target if you want a conspiracy. Changing and Admiral or a desk officer doesn't allow a swift attack on a colony for example... (None of this is on the movie of course... a shame...) Well, a clone is made... and marooned on the Remus planet (never heard of it? Think... the Rome founders: Romulus and...). Although no one explains more about this Shinzon (the clone), and why is he kept alive if he is of no more use, we need him alive! It's the reason of the movie! (C'mon folks...be a little flexible...) and he allows you to think many things: first of all, a person is a very complex thing, with multiple facets. You could create a ""nemesis"" with any of these aspects of the same character. I think Picard had many ""nemesis"" (just like Bond, Superman or any hero you could imagine...) and the best of them is, of course ""Q"" but... second thing: even twins are different in personality, desires and goals. Culture, environment and education mark a person for life, and this is not the first time you see an evil counterpart in Star trek (remember the mirror universe?) so... third thing: what if you have another life, totally the opposite? Could you blame yourself for your own acts? And going back to Khan's:  remember he was genetically created... Anyway, Picard's mind go through radical emotions: anger, compassion, and even paternal affection I think, all about Shinzon. In a certain key moment Picard freezes in front of Shinzon and you think ""this is it, they're all gonna die"" because this ""I can't blame him for being evil"" thing.
All in all, you need any subplot to make the end. (Or may be not everyone... for example the pre warp people in the sand planet watching ""aliens"": bye bye prime directive...) B-4, Data's dumb brother is an expendable character... but you see it's necessary, he can be funny reminding us of the old first season lieutenant commander positronic-brained-terahertz-powered-incapable-of-whistling android... and for other things... I regret deeply he wasn't a little bit smarter in the end... Finally, you have a ship battle sequence like no one in the trek saga of movies. In its time, Star trek 2 was the same thing, and of course you face a no-win scenario, with a sacrifice... and that's all I will say about it (like Gump says...)
My final opinion: Well, I have both movies: I prefer Khan's because of Montalban's performance: simply majestic! Khan is able to transmit you his wrath... Shinzon can't. You could even think he can be turned to the ""light side of the force"" for moments... (forgive me trekkies for I have sinned...) it's not a bad guy... just... uninformed (Xavier's words...)
But for the DVD version: this is the best made of the next generation movies: it has extra footage, an alternate ending (excellent but incompatible with the final cut) and documentaries. If you ask me about the best trek movie, I'd say Star trek 2, and if you think of an equivalent for it in next gen, this is your choice. But please, don't forget ""First Contact"", the second place of the saga. Nemesis is a movie for thiking fans, those who can read between the lines and say: ""the story is good, its way to be told is a little irrelevant. it's a fine good bye for Picard's saga... But, if someone of trek writers read these: please make more movies!",1060819200,,4184,4.723666210670315
1464758,4,B00005JLRT,"Let's face it, the story is basically built like ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" but in respect it's interesting to put ""The Next Generation"" cast in that type of plot which pretty much almost lives up to TWOK! To Jean-Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart)shock, he discovers that the Romulans somehow gained a sample of his DNA, and created Shinzon(Tom Hardy, who gives a good performance, but let's face it he's no Ricardo Montalban); his younger clone. However, when the Romulans abandoned their plan to use Shinzon, he's exiled to the planet Remus(which was established in the original series episode:""Balance of Terror.""), and soon creates his own army of Reman slaves. Now Shinzon, having seized control of the Romulan empire, plans on the detruction of Picard, and Earth all with the use of a very deadly weapon. ""Nemesis"" stands very much alone as a good ""Star Trek"" movie, but it wasn't as dark as some fans might have wished. It would have been interesting to see more of the villainy behind the Romulans, and to make them stand out some more. Plus the Shinzon character could have been more threating, and powerful a villain than just being a spoiled young kid who got screwed up really bad. Heck, if he's the clone of Picard, why couldn't Patrick Stewart perform as Picard and the clone? The movie was good on some more notes: the bonding of Riker & Troi, and Data finding a long lost brother. I think Brent Spiner(Data & B-4) had some of his best moments with this movie. Still John Logan's script, though a good one, could have explored more with the characters, and been more action-packed! Great special effects, and there is a truly awesome scene when the Enterprise rams into the alien ship. Trust me, you will get a lot from this movie, but I sort of feel that it could've have been done much more better.",1060646400,,1820,4.672897196261682
1464759,4,B00005JLRT,"In many ways Nemesis is best Star Trek movie and in others it is not.  For example, the SFX on Nemesis far outstrip First Contact or Inserecction whereas it lacks in storyline as opposed to The Voyage Home.

1464804,2,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis is better than its predecessor Insurrection.  It also boasts the most extended space battle scene of any of the Star Trek films.
Unfortunately, the plot suffers from serious logic gaps.  The Romulan generals grow impatient with Shinzon (Private Twombly in 'Black Hawk Down')for not attacking the Federation immediately.  Then, when he is engaged in combat against the Enterprise, two Romulan ships enter the fray to assist Picard.  Why would they turn against Shinzon after assisting his rise to power?  And would a Romulan commander use a slang term like ""We are dead in the water"" after her ship is knocked out of commission?
We can understand why Shinzon is mad at the Romulans, but his beef with the Federation is never made clear.  Star Trek fans deserved better than this lazily written story. A new creative team is needed to breathe life into this franchise.
Star Trek is supposed to be about exploring new worlds and meeting new life forms.. but the films appear to have strayed away from this concept.  If there is going to be another Star Trek film, let's hope the Enterprise returns to its original mission.",1060214400,,1127,4.869109947643979
1464805,1,B00005JLRT,"I awaited this film in great anticipation...I shouldn't have bothered. The script is ridiculous and is only surpassed in its mind-numbingness by the plot which plods along from one unexplained and ill thought out set piece to the next.
The film starts promisingly with a wedding scene which still manages to show some of the humour and a dash of sentimentality that are a hallmark of Star Trek films. It's downhill fast from here folks...
We are soon transported to another world where, as luck would have it, Picard and co stumble across the dismembered body of a predecessor to Data. Thereafter follows a completely unnessecary and totally unbelievable car chase / shootout with a group of aliens that looked suspiciously like the 'Sandpeople' from Star Wars. And guess what...they just happen to be driving ATV's aswell! I strongly strongly suspect that someone on the design team for this film has spent a great deal of time playing 'Halo' on the X-Box! If you have played it you will know what I mean.
The villian pops up out of nowhere and somehow manages to overthrow the Romulan government with the help of a few skeletal creatures with a deep aversion to sunlight (handy on the battlefield huh!). No attempt is really made to explain this properly apart from the fact that he spent years in slavery in a Romulan mine and now hates everyone. Oh, guess what, said villian also happens to be a clone of Picard who, wait for it, needs Picard's blood to survive. This whole episode is eventually explained away with a liberal dash of Star Trek uber-mumbo-jumbo, but by this time you don't even bother trying to decipher it as you have resigned yourself to the fact that you are watching an absolute turkey of a film that is an absolute disgrace to the memory of Gene Rodenberry.
Last and least we are treated, YET AGAIN, to the Enterprise crashing into something....snore. And I nearly forgot, after Data has sacrificed himself, we learn that all of his memories have been placed into his prototype 'brother' who is now crew on the Enterprise. Wow...I wonder what's going to happen there?! A cunning plot twist.
To sum up:- This is a lazy film, with a juvenile script and story that leaves you not giving a toss whether they ever bother to make another Star Trek film. It's more like ""The A-Team"" in space. The team on the next film, assuming they can find backers for a new one after this pile of tosh, should take a good hard look at 'Khan' and 'The Undiscovered Country' - easily the best films of the franchise. HUGELY dissappointing!",1060041600,7,2542,4.68903803131991
1464806,5,B00005JLRT,"I saw Nemesis in the theatre and purchased the dvd upon its first day of release.  From then probably have viewed it another 8 or so times.  So why the chills?  The final 30 or so minutes of this movie is worth everything.  The special effects and battle sequences are the best I have ever seen in anything trek to date - period!  In the theatre I found myself gripping my seat and unmoving for this period.  Even if the rest of the movie was horrible, it would still be worth it just to see the ship-to-ship fights.  As for the rest of the movie, it is far from ugly, as many viewers and especially critics have said.  I don't understand it.  Maybe if you are not a Trek fanatic then it isn't entirely appealing, but for any Trek appreciator, I strongly believe Nemesis will be nothing less of a thrill ride. The story revolves heavily around Picard and his younger clone, ""Shinzon""  There are some that knock this because the movie revolves around these characters so much, well, that's why they called it ""Nemesis"", it was suposed to.  Yes, Shinzon is scary.  At first I almost laughed in the theatre when his image was revealed, looking almost like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers.  Throughout the movie, in each scene, Shinzon becomes more angry, aggressive, and more ""evil and gruesome-looking"" (there's a part of the story that deals with why).  Then there's Shinzon's viceroy, played by Ron Pearlman who did such a fine job that he could play the role of the evil-villan in several of the scenes. The dark and resonant voice of the character just sets a very creepy effect that is really cool.  Back to the Picard vs. Shinzon deal; upon first watching I thought it was a bit of nonsense connected to a complete madman.  Well, in a sense Shinzon becomes a madman later in the film when his plans fall apart.  And there is more to this conflict than meets the eye.  Picard is faced with what he would be like if he had lived Shinzon's life.  He tries to resist the emotional attacks from Shinzon on the subject, but you can tell that Picard is really affected at times with the matter in a very deep, person way (naturally).  It makes for a pretty interesting story. Some of the scenes are hard to follow but that is due to the extreme editing for the final cut.  The deleted scenes included on the dvd ""extras"" allow for some things to make more sense.
The dvd itself is terrific.  The digital video and audio effects are excellent and even better than in the theatre (with a good home theatre system of course).  With the exceptions of the special editions dvds of Treks' 1 - 4, Nemesis has more extras than any other Trek dvd.
The big problem about Nemesis for everyone is that it is a copy of The Wrath of Khan.  It very much is similar in almost every way.  But the good news is that if you loved ST2, than Nemesis will not disapoint.  Think of it as a new and refreshing sequal to the best Trek movie ever.",1060041600,2,2914,4.4
1464807,2,B00005JLRT,"Oh boy, what a fuzz about this movie.
What was it? Number Ten? OK, so what? The Enterprise is going down and this time for good. Not like in The Search of Spock or Generations though. I am afraid the producers miscalculated big time.
First of all, I want to say that I am absolutely not against newcomers in the movie business. Actually it was time to have some pop up, but like this?
The Man simply cannot act. He mumbles his words. People told me how scary Shinzon was. Scary? He was mad, crazy, paranoiac, but scary? C'mon, give me a break here.
Dracula was scary, and I don't mean Gary Oldman. I mean Christopher Lee. When he appeared on top of a staircase, in his long draped cape, in half-shadow, without even uttering a word, you knew he meant trouble. But Shinzon, with his boyish ""puppy"" face?
I found Ron Perlman far more threatening than him.
The story too, is a disgrace. More a work out of a Star Trek computer game, than the excellent and more humane plots of the original series or even of The Next Generation series.
Here too, as in my previous review of ""Die Another Day"" I saw no imagination, no relation to the characters. They are all puppets set up in a game, rather than living and breathing human beings.
You cannot sense the concerns, the true frailty and the pain of the various characters. This was still all there in Generations, First Contact and even in the less fortunate Insurrection. But here?
Even the more than human android Data (Brent Spiner), whose struggle to be more like his companions, seems vanished, just to reappear briefly towards the end of the picture as a last minute afterthought.
What to say about Data's ""brother""? Well, Lore he is not and it is a wonder that Data ever became Data at all, viewed what a moron this new ""brother"" is. Besides, it makes no sense. In all the previous episodes and movies we were constantly told that Data had only one brother.
Watch out! Not anymore, now we have another one. A stupid one.
And all this for what, a sequel?
If the sequel is as bad as this one, I will have seen the last of Star Trek in my life and I will stick to what I own, rather than venture out there, ""where no sane mind has ever gone before"".
No, Nemesis, is a bitter disappointment. The special effects are OK, but they are not everything. The music is so-so.
The directing though, lacks knowledge of the true spirit that made the ""Big Bird"" create the series in the first place.
We don't need ""intellectualoids"" to direct a science fiction - adventure movie. What we need is people who know the series back and forth as the back of their hands and not a Kubrick-like visionary (I doubt that Kubrick even remotely, wanted to direct a Star Trek movie).
Where is Leonard Nimoy? He is a director as well. Where is Nicholas Meyer? Those guys knew what they were doing... Even Winrich Kolbe, who directed many TV episodes across the Star Trek spectrum, should have had a chance.
But no. Mr. ""allmighty"" Berman had to decide otherwise. I wonder if he really knows what Star Trek is all about, besides its money value.
Perhaps, Mr. Berman should rather go back to its roots, instead of playing on new territories in which he truly has absolutely no competence about.
No Mr. Berman. This is not Star Trek. I don't know what it should represent, but besides recognizing a Sci-Fi flick, I don't see the spirit of Gene Roddenberry in this one.
And then they said ""Star Trek V - The Final Frontier"" was bad.
Well, let me tell you, give me Star Trek V anytime, rather than this weak attempt at inner-psychology.
One more thing. At Star Trek XI, bring back some good old villains, rather than your new, dull ones. Anything, Cardassians, Klingons, The Dominion, even the good old Borg.
Or why not, a touch of Q gone bad. Or a mixture of them all, but spare us weak imitations, like Kazons (besides, who would really be afraid of villains in curlers?).
Last but not least, hire someone who can write an interesting mystery story and had some true, old-fashioned creativeness and imagination.
To the actors, my suggestion would be not to listen to the directors so much, but rather let your feelings go wild.
To you all, my word of warning, buy it if you are an absolute Star Trek fan and want this one to complete your collection. To everyone else I'd suggest a better use of your time.",1059868800,2,4325,4.4759493670886075

Usually I get the star trek movies on the day of release, but this time due to the two reasons I mentioned above, I delayed getting this one until just recently. And my initial thought was right, the critics were wrong. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good Nemesis is. I love the whole Picard ""Romulan as the human weapon"" Clone thing; and I liked the Death and rebirth of the beloved Data thing as well. The Clone of Picard reminded me somewhat of Luke Skywalker, finding out, Vader was His father, but it is still fresh in its own way. The death of Data, to save His crew and the enterprise, was both sad and yet comforting, knowing that his memories were transferred to B4. Very cool stuff.

1464809,1,B00005JLRT,"Worst Trek film ever.  I loved the Star Trek movies and series, well except DS9, but we won't discuss that here.  This film was the worst.
The story made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Why is a human clone in charge of the Romulan Empire?  That is never fully explained, or not believably.  Why does the villain not take what he needs from Picard early in the film?  He has ample opportunity.  What does the villain hate Picard and the Federation so much?  Again, not nearly adequately explained.
The special effects were acceptable.  Not great, but acceptable.  But without an adequate story line, the movie just degenerates into action movie with no plot.

1464810,5,B00005JLRT,"For physical reasons I was unable to see this movie at the theater.  However, the long wait for the video was well worth it.  Paramount went out and hired one of the best action directors in the person of Stephen Baird.  The escape scenes involving Picard and other crew members are scintillating and inventive.  The final encounter between the Enterprise and the Scimitar is even more thrilling than the crashlanding of the Enterprise-D in GENERATIONS.
Also brought in for this movie was the gifted screenwriter John Logan.  Through the dialogue between Picard and Shinzon he ratchets up the tension as the story progresses.  This effectively sets the stage for the action sequences that Baird has skillfully devised.  Logan fit in perfectly with Star Trek's philosophy that the characters should be the driving force in the movie and not just pawns in the hands of the director.
Many critics complained that the film was difficult to follow because of sloppy editing.  For what it's worth, I watched this movie with a friend and we never spoke until it ended.  We were so riveted by NEMESIS that we allowed nothing to distract us.  If there was an edting problem, I would think that my mind would have wondered at various points of the movie.  That never happened!  Recent movies like BLACKHAWK DOWN and LORD OF THE RINGS were so dominated by action and gruesome images that they grew tiresome.
When I realized that NEMESIS was going to be a disappointment at the Box Office, I initially felt sorry for the hundreds of people at Paramount who created this marvelous adventure.  However, I changed my feelings and want to salute everyone involved for giving us an excellent film to mark the end of the Star Trek movies (maybe!).",1059523200,10,1729,4.820338983050847

I started to realize I was in trouble when the crew arrives on a planet and finds the remains of a robot that ""looks just like DATA!"" um, wouldn't that be LORE? one of the most beloved bad guys on the series? nope, no one on the crew has ever heard of a Lore.

It's unfortunate that this movie, like the others before it, tend to focus so much on the captain that it ignores the other great characters.  It's nice to see Will and Deanna get married and Will getting his own ship.  It's also nice to see that Wesley Crusher was at the wedding.  What really frustrates me is the notion to once again try to create a deep and meaningful relationship between the Captian the lead villian, this time because he was cloned from him.  I understand Star Trek is supposed to be about more then just space and starship battles, but this aspect dragged the story down too much.  There should have been more focus on Data and Geordi's freindship, to make Data's death more potent.  There should have been a scene with Picard and Dr. Crusher stating how they would miss each other since she was going to Starfleet medical, y'know, build on the potential romance.  Wesley Crusher should have has some lines.  There should have been more interaction between the entire crew!  This was supposed to be a goodbye story where this stellar crew who are like a family and have been through Life and Death several times together, end up doing one last duty together to save Earth, the Federation and start a mending process with one of their greatest and most mysterious of enemies, where they end up saying goodbye to one of their own who DIES, AND INSTEAD THEY TURN IT INTO A POTENTIAL FATHER/SON EPISODE TO FILL THE VOID IN PICARDS LIFE BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN?!!  HE MADE THAT DECISION A LONG TIME AGO!  He's over it!  He should be saying goodbye to these younger crew members that he's nurtured for 12 years into the fine officers they are!  They should have treated Shinzon like the evil, dark, mind raping outcast that he is.  There would still be sympathy for him if you keep the final scene between him and Picard at the end.  Picard makes a fine speech about how his upbringing and surroundings made him what he is, that it wasn't his fault and he could still change.  Also, the scene where Data explains why he and Picard are different from their Romulan created counterparts, a very good scene.  But this is about it.  Don't let my rant totally turn you off.  This movie is good, very good.  Just a little slow paced between action scenes and not focusing on the right material...in my opinion.  I wish I could go and re-edit this movie, I think it would be more crowd pleasing and more sentimentaly based on the crew members we have grown to love.",1059004800,3,2641,4.513684210526316
1464860,5,B00005JLRT,"I was VERY pleased at how well 'Nemesis' turned out on so many different levels.  I was skeptical at first when I heard that Brent Spiner (Data) had a part in the script, after all, who could forget William Shatner's dismal storyline for Trek V The Final Frontier (I'll give him credit however, his novels have been surprisingly excellent).
'Nemesis' is about discovery.  We find out about a whole new race of humanoids known as 'Remens' who are basically slaves to the Romulans.  After hatching a diabolical scheme to eliminate the leaders of the Romulan Senate, one particular Reman takes over and has an ultimate goal of destruction on quite a grand scale.  The major twist to this story is his relationship with Picard (MUCH closer than you might think--unless you've read the novel or seen the movie).
Along the way we find yet another reincarnation of Data, an even earlier version, kind of like a Stupid Data--but likeable.  I found one part difficult to swallow--especially in light of today's special effects: the Superman scene with Data flying from the Enterprise to the Reman starship through space...sorry, but THAT looked cheesy.  Other than that, I must say this was a VERY good story which contained a reunion at the beginning which included Wesley Crusher and even Guinan (you'll have to see it to appreciate it) although it was cut TOO short and for the most part the cameo's were useless since they never got a chance to do or say anything, but it WAS nice to see them all together.
It's sad to think that this was the last of the Next Generations Movies, although if history is ANY indication, never say NEVER.  Will we ever see Data again?  I think they certainly leave it open for a return in the future should the cast ever agree to do an additional film, but I'm not holding my breath.  Action, humor and an all-around great plot make this superior in EVERY way to 'Insurrection' which was nothing more than a weak 60 minute episode stretched impossibly thin to create a feature-length movie.  I'd say overall, this was the best NEXT Gen movie and a worthy addition to the Trek Universe.",1059004800,,2111,4.696476964769648
1464861,2,B00005JLRT,This movie was like a big overblown STNG episode. I enjoyed it as long as I kept my brain turned off. Patrick Stewart was wonderful as Captain Picard but it seems like he was just going through the motions to get a paycheck. He is a capable actor and his talents were wasted on this film. The deleted scenes would've actually made the movie a lot better if they were included. Shinzon was not as effective a villian as Kahn no matter what Berman says! Shinzon seemed like some rushed into production character added to the Star Trek universe just for this movie. The Romulans would never have allowed the Remans to take over the Romulan Senate I mean it would be the same as The Borg being defeated by a horde of Jawas or the efforts of one federation captain (i.e. Voyager) which I thought was just as ridiculous. But we needed a movie to include the Romulans so they came up with this garbage! What a travesty!,1058918400,,912,4.402366863905326
1464862,2,B00005JLRT,"I've been a fan of Star Wars since my mother first showed me reruns and took me to see ""Wrath of Kahn"" in the theaters.  When ""The Next Generation"" came out, I don't think I missed an episode.  In 1991, the original crew was given a dignified, graceful exit in the form of ""The Undiscovered Country"".  So it was my hope, in waiting for ""Nemesis"", that the Next Gen crew would be treated with the same diginity and respect.  Sadly, the movie is a disaster of near ""Final Frontier"" proportions, becuase, although as not as bad as ""Insurrection"" or ""Generations"", it is the final appearance of these beloved characters, and that is the true crime.
The story is that the Remans, a never before heard of offshoot of the Romulans have taken control of the Romulan Empire.  Naturally, the Enterprise is the only ship in the sector, as always, and is sent to great the new head of the Empire.  Well, he's Picard's Clone, and tries to gain his trust, while his real reason is that he a)needs Picards blood to live, and b)wants to kill everyone on Earth for some reason involving revenge.(logically, as Earth never did anything to him, he should want to destroy all the Romulans, and he shows so much contempt for them that you wonder why he doesn't.  Of course, the movie wouldn't work, then).
Star Trek, despite the worst intentions of Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, has always been about the people.  None of the incarnations of the show would be popular if the characters weren't interesting.  Which is why ""Voyager"" and ""Enterprise"" are weak entires in the series.  In all of the first 6 films, and especially in the two best Trek films, ""Kahn""  and ""Undiscovered Country"", the characters were called upon to react to changes in their lives, to loss and to the consequences of their actions(or inactions).  In this film, well, Data sings.  Which he did in the last film.  Riker plays the Trombone and sucks in his gut.  Troi ""feels uneasy"".  Worf, so compelling on ""TNG"" and ""DS9"" is again reduced to comic relief.  And the whole crew is still together.  At least in the first 6 films the characters had moved on to other things.  Kirk, as Admiral in 1-4, Spock, dead for a bit, Sulu a Captain, Checkov on the Reliant as First Officer.  In the ""Next Gen"" films, everything is the same, it's jusy like one very long poorly written TV episode.  At the end of each of the films, after the enemy defeated, the situtation is pretty much the same as in the beginning, more or less.  Nobody learns anything or really moves on(Riker and Troi are leaving the ship, but it's handled very poorly, and the ""death"" of a character is treated almost as a punch line.)  The Screenwritter, John Logan, who penned ""Gladiator"", claims to be a fan, but you wonder what he was a fan OF, if this is teh sendoff he gives the characters he ""loves"".  This is why the film is unforgiveable.
There are many action scenes in this movie, but the only ones that work are the space battle ones, and they are about the only redeaming part of the film.  The first action scene which involves a Starfleet ATV, a ""road-warrior"" like gang of aliens, none of the laws of physics, and another Data-like android, is shot bleached out, ala the Mexico scenes in ""Traffic"".  Why?  I have no idea.  Maybe to hide the poor special effects, or to distract from the fact that the entire subplot is poorly written and illogical.  For instance, we are told WHY the Data-like Android is there, eventually, but we don't know where he came.  This contradicts so much development in the series that it's sick.  But it moves the plot along.
The biggest Special Effect in this film is the new Reman Warbird, the Scimitar, which apparently has more power than anything ever in the universe.  It's a BIG ship.  So when Picard and Data are running through the halls, you have to wonder why only about 10 people seem to inhabit it.  Plus, the hallways look so much like cheap sets that the Original Series looked futuristic by comparison.
The director is Stuart Baird, who made ""Executive Decision"", the Steven Segal/Kurt Russell terrorist movie that has the dual honor of being considered more offensive to the Arab community than ""True Lies"" and for thankfully killing off Segal in the first act.  Well, I guess the good cancels out the bad, in this case.  Anyway, he has no style, nothing special to bring to the screen.  Compare this to the Original Crew sendoff, in which they brought back the writer/director of ""Wrath of Kahn"", a man who knew how to make  Trek Film.  Baird is clumsy with exposition scenes, and his space battles, while fantastic looking, actually drag.
The only reason this disc gets 2 stars is that it has many deleted scenes that actually would have helped the film.  The commentary is self-serving, almosy a defense of the film, and offers nothing of substance on the process.  In the end, I actually have to call this the WORST Trek of all time because Shatner can at least claim that ""Final Frontier"" was edited out from under him and his budget was slashed.  Baird and Berman apparently worked together with a large budget on this mess, so they get no such consideration.  Avoid the film at all costs, and weep for the loss of a great franchise.",1058832000,,5213,4.5902702702702705

Patrick and crew put in an admirable performance despite their weak and sometimes pathetic dialogue. I thought that we would be treated to something great for their last effort together. I guess that this shows we can all be wrong sometimes. I hope that we will see them together at least one more time; so we can be treated to something more perfect. The television New Generation out does most of what we have seen on the big screen. Although this thought does not include ""First Contact,"" which is by far their most perfect endeavor.

This movie yet again focuses on Data, a completely uninteresting character with no personality, and the impressive Jean Luc Picard, who seems to be the only consistantly positive note in all the Star Trek movies only because of the superb acting of Patrik Stewart.  This movies weak plot centers around a clone of Jean Luc Picard, raising determinism and free will issues.  The clone doesn't seem like a real person but just a sadistic movie villain, evident in the random and pointless sensual scene between the clone and Dana Troi.  The ending continues to highlight Data's pursuit to become human in an act of unbelievable utilitarian sacrifice.  Unfortunately the tolerable Data is then replaced by a stupid spineless version of the android: no doubt Brent Spinner's attempt to write a more challenging acting role for himself in the sequel.
Previews make this film look like a big action blockbuster, but are decieving.
Lastly there are even more references to former Star Trek movies and shows in this movie which make this movie more like another episode on TV.

We have waited a long time to see Riker get his own ship and what do we get, a nice scene between Picard and Riker but no Captain Riker on his bridge taking the Titan out for his first voyage as Captain.

TNG will always be my favorite ST and to have it end on this note is truly sad. Finally breaking the tradition of even numbered movies being better - the responsibility of this disaster lies squarely on the shoulders of the director. They might as well have gotten John Woo - after all if you're going to destroy a franchise why not get someone with experience (ie. Mission Impossible II)
The cast is still the strongest of the ST franchises and is the only reason this isn't getting a one star review. There's also a nice cameo by Janeway. Pity they couldn't come up with a better script than this. Worst of all the deja vu ending (circa Wrath of Khan) leaves even the non ST fans thinking ""Hmm this looks strangely familiar""

I think the Next Generation movies have been a mixed bag just as with the original cast movies -- but even when they missed it was not this bad.

1464914,4,B00005JLRT,"I am a huge fan of Star Trek: TNG. The series made for compelling television. The movies, aside from First Contact, have been lackluster and seemingly lost in the mythos that they are trying to portray. Star Trek is about a journey, new horizons, and ultimately, family. Whereas Nemesis adequately protrays the latter element admirably, the rest of the story gets bogged down in continuity issues and lame attempts to squeeze every member of the TNG into every possible camera shot, whether they should be in the scene or not. This is not to say that Nemesis is a bad film, as science-fiction films go. On the contrary, it stands on its own when taken only as a ""science-fiction"" movie. Star Trek fans want more than that. But knowing that in ""All Good Things"" Troi actually marries Worf (not to mention that in the Star Trek timeline he was assigned to DS9 AND wound up being an ambassador in All Good Things) it makes the major emotional points of the film pale slightly. We can never invest in the Riker/Troi marriage knowing that it should not actually happen, but nevertheless, it is still a Trek film. Tom Hardy is more than adequate as the sinister Shinzon. And the special effects are very well done. I had just hoped that the beloved crew of the Enterprise had been granted a more graceful sendoff.",1058227200,4,1307,4.637931034482759

But it did not surprass Star Trek Generations.  I do not like how the Borg are depicted in the Next Generation.  I always saw them as Janeway's enemy, not Picards, so that's why I was dissapointed in First Contact. Perhaps one of my favorite parts of the film was the cameo appearance of Admiral Janeway (Voyager's former Captain) who gave Captain Picard his orders. This is an enjoyable film, loaded with action. But I would have to say it's time for the Next Generation crew to really move on, and so that's what this film depicted.

1464916,1,B00005JLRT,"In the tenth installment of the Star Trek movie saga, Star Trek: Nemesis tries too hard to atone for the lack of space conflict in the ninth film, Insurrection, and tries too hard to be what Star Trek is not, nor ever has been, about.
This film, focusing on the plot of an angry young Picard clone, presented an interesting villain, but an unrealistic concept backing said villain.  While genetically identical to the real Picard, Shinzon and Picard are virtually nothing alike, due to the differences in their upbringing.  The whole idea that they would be connected in terms of thought processes is preposterous, to say the least.  What's more, the plot focuses so much on Picard, that none but the second most interesting Enterprise crew member, Data, truly get any screen time.  For all intents and purposes, this film should have been called ""Star Trek: Picard and Data Have an Adventure with a bunch of other unimportant people.""  Each and every other character is wasted, with Riker and Deanna's wedding being virtually the only scene to feature the two in any kind of prominent role, Dr. Crusher and Geordi seeming to disappear completely, and Worf reduced to a drunk who doesn't like to hear singing androids.  In addition, with the film's mood being so dark, none of these characters could even get in any characteristic Trek humor.  The plot parallels between Picard and Data, in terms of Picard's clone and Data's prototype, is interesting, but beyond simply occuring at the same time, share no other connections.
The film tries exceptionally hard to make itself out to be an action movie of sorts, with nearly half the film filled with space battles, dune-buggy phaser fighting, and Picard and Data fighting the crew of the Scimitar, Picard's clone's ship, which possesses a bizarre, over-animated ""super-weapon.""  Star Trek was always about exploration, strange new life, and life's great journey- not about all the alien butts to be kicked at the end of that journey.
Seeing how the Enterprise, as a character in the previous film, was wasted, featured only in a few shots orbiting the planet and running like a scared dog with its warp nacelles between its legs, in Nemesis, the Enterprise is given a half-hour battle with a vessel of Picard's clone.  Not only is it overdone, but it's unnecessary for the sake of the plot- the real action takes place aboard the vessels.
Despite all of these weaknesses, the climax of the movie, and essentially the film's end, brought me to tears.  Data has always been my favorite Trek character, and this scene showed him at his best.  The ending nearly redeemed the film for me, but not quite.
If only for the spectacular ending, I gave Star Trek: Nemesis a single star.  See it once for the express purpose of the ending- and then never, ever see this horrid piece of Star Trek history again.",1058140800,27,2847,4.823408624229979

Continuing the trend of the even number movies being better, Nemesis (#10) is arguably better then Insurrection (#9).  Plus, many favorites pop up in cameos.
The Plot: An apparent coup d'etat occurs on Romulus, and the Enterprise is sent to investigate.  When Picard meets the new leader of the Romulans, he's shocked to see a striking resemblance to himself.  The Enterprise crew try to work with the new leader, but suspect treachery.  The special effects are not particularly impressive, especially in light of other recent sci-fi movies, but then Star Trek has never been just about the f/x.  The movie explores issues of cloning in a relatively interesting, but precursory, manner.  The DVD includes many deleted scenes, which help explain some of the underdeveloped plots (e.g., Troi's mind-melding) and underused characters (e.g., Dr. Crusher).
Overall, a pretty good Star Trek movie that is likely to appease fans of the series; non-fans are likely to be a bit bored and unimpressed.  Patrick Stewart has said that this movie is the last for the Next Generation crew, so enjoy!",1057363200,,1282,4.898148148148148

A few stupid things about the movie were, when we last saw Worf he became a klingon ambassador. At the end of DS9 everyone was sitting at the table and signed the peace treaty ending the Dominion war. The Klingons, the Federation, and the Romulans had joined forces and became allies to defeat the Dominion. Why were the Federation and the Romulans enemies again? And I can't stand it when they try to make a star trek movie something it isn't, what was the point of having Data sing at the wedding?
The whole entire premise of the movie was so stupid; a clone of Picard who wanted to kill him because he believed that he was an echo of the real man. How stupid is that, this whole movie was a joke. It was a disgrace. Insurrection would have been a better way to end the next generation's journey. I've read some of the other reviews and some of the people wrote that the movie was visually stunning; I thought that Insurrection and First Contact were much more visually appealing.
In conclusion, this movie was a waste. I've watched the show since the beginning and I've seen all of the movies and this was by far the worst TNG movie. I would hope that they don't let it end this way, and I would think that they probably won't.

Living in a country where the movie theaters are not so up to date as the ones in North America, I had to wait for the DVD version. The first thing that you would notice is how marginal all the characters are in the movie , as marginal as the plot itself. The whole movie revolves around captain Pickard and his romulan  raised clone (who by the way happens to own a powerful weapon), and how the captain battles with himself to finally decide to ram over his ""nemesis"" with the Enterprise (destroying yet another ship in the process)  to save the federation, and kill data in the process . I sat there and wondered, if the romulans had this wonder weapon to destroy practically anything and a spaceship to match, why did they need to replicate Pickard and then drag him half way cross the galaxy to tell him that?? They could have just shown up uninvited and destroyed earth, that would have solved their problem for ever wouldn't it?! I still wonder! The story is so unworthy of the history and effort that was put into the next generation for the past 15 years or so!
Most of the characters had only a few lines and hardly had a role. You would have to depend on your knowledge of the characters to imagine what they could be doing through out the movie. And even Troy who had more to say than the rest put together (except data and the captain) changed from this compassionate forgiving person to a vindictive character seeking revenge from some Romulan who invaded her mind! So unlike her!  Nothing in this movie reminds me of  Gene Roddenberry's STNG! Nothing of the spirit or the morality of STGN! Nothing at all!
I had to go back and watch several of my favorite STGN episodes and all 3 previous movies to wash out the bad taste this movie left behind.
In my opinion There are several star trek books already published that would have made wonderful movies, Nemesis is not one of them.
This is not the way I want to remember what could be the last of  Star Trek: the Next Generation, the Enterprise and all of it's wonderful crew. Star Trek was always about hope and how humanity should seek to better itself. always gave me something to look forward to and something to hope for. This movie killed all that.

1464961,2,B00005JLRT,"After watching this film I went back and watched First Contact and was amazed by how much more energy and snappy dialog it had.  To me this film felt full of plot holes and was tired.  Tired especially in its use of old formulae:  a threat to Earth, an outgunned Enterprise (they sure did better against the Borg!), the insipid weepiness of Deanna Troi, an alien device for Picard to figure out and defuse before it goes off (has anyone kept track of how many times he has done this?), the inability of the crew--Data this time, in the wedding scene--to quit singing and dancing and get off Broadway altogether...
And some parts were just silly.  The pronged metal thing that just happened to be on the Scimitar's bridge for Picard to use against his alter ego.  Another android, seemingly out of nowhere, found by chance in time for an insidious agenda.  Half the crew departing without even a heartfelt goodbye.  And a dune buggy with a phaser rifle and big tires:  this is the best the 24th Century can do in terms of new equipment?  Did Starfleet HQ move to Baja?
The film did have its strong points.  The bad guy could be whiny but was eloquent in places.  The exploration of cloning and individuality was timely, if limited.  Patrick Stewart is great in just about everything he appears in, even if he did scream too much in Moby Dick.  Same with Brent Spiner.
I've been watching STNG since its inception, and if this is indeed the last film, then perhaps it needs to be, although a more dramatically crafted finale--like ""All Good Things""--would have let the show depart the stage with a bang rather than a whimper.  After watching the film twice I told myself that perhaps a lack of closure said something essential and good about the series itself.  But in the end, I didn't believe it.",1056240000,,1795,4.565625

I heard more negative comments than positive ones before I saw it, so I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised to find it enjoyable after all.  It's not Star Trek:TNG going out with a bang, but I still enjoyed the movie all the way through.  It felt more like just another episode of Star Trek rather than a movie finale.  It wasn't as powerful as Insurrection, which would have been a better choice for the final ST:TNG movie.",1056240000,,494,4.455555555555556
1465010,1,B00005JLRT,"I learned two things from this movie that I found somewhat disturbing:
1.  There are still SUVs in the 24th century.
2.  Picard was bald as a teenager.
I love ST:TNG.  It's one of my favorite shows.  The movies, though, have tended to be very hit-or-miss.  Any movie that starts off with Patrick Stuart destroying fragile alien desert ecosystems in a 24th century SUV and ends with the Enterprise ramming itself into another ship is definitely a miss.
Our antagonist in this movie, Shinzon, is supposed to be a clone of Picard.  This is proven by showing us, the audience, a picture of a much younger Picard in his Academy cadet uniform.  They are physically identical.  And they are both bald, which I don't understand at all, because this belies what we learned in the ST:TNG episode ""Rascals"", where a teenaged Picard has a full head of hair.
In any case, Shinzon looked more like Dr. Evil from ""Austin Powers"" dressed in creaky cowhides than a young Patrick Stuart.  (If you listen carefully, Shinzon's leather outfit does in fact make squeaky noises whenever he moves!)
The plot was weak, the makeup for the Remans bizarre (aren't they, like the Romulans, supposed to be an offshoot of the Vulcans?  Why would living in the dark do that to their skin??), and the killing off of one of the senior staff members incomprehensible.
The only highlight of this movie is finally watching Riker and Troi tie the knot.  Even that was shaky, though, because you KNOW Lwaxana Troi would SO BE THERE at her daughter's wedding, even if she was going to have a Betazoid ceremony later. And apparently Wesley somehow got an invitation while dressing warmly on other planes of existence, because he was there.
Star Trek fans, by all means watch this movie.  You'll probably be sorry you did, but would you really be a Trekkie if you passed it over?",1056067200,,1837,4.688473520249222

The problem is a writer who hasn't written much and a director who is unfamiliar with the franchise and has little experience directing (though a lot of good editing jobs). It's an interesting story that centers around Picard and Data. Riker gets a good action sequence. Troi has a decent role. As does Jordi. But Worf was just overlooked in this film. They touched on all the different series in one way or another. I know that the Star Trek franchise won't end, even if it isn't the Next Generation cast anymore.

1465012,3,B00005JLRT,"What makes a Trek film? Well to start a fine, fast moving plot intwined with action and a fine balance of characters and their development, this is something that Star Trek II accomplished with flying colors and what Star Trek X had some problems with.
  The beginning with the Wedding was a nice way to get us back into familiararity with the characters we've come to know in the last 15 years, so we see anymore of them later, not really. I still don't understand why you hire 7 supporting cast mates if they aren't goin to do anything, Star Trek II primarily focused on Kirk but there was fine dialogue between Kirk n McCoy, Spock and Saavik, Scotty and the death of his nephew, all of this was contributed to the film. Dr. Crusher didn't do anyting, Riker was a lil overprotective but thats all he did, Data, since he had B-4 nobody cared, and Worf had his own set of problems.
  Something that Rick Berman hasn't caught onto yet is that Star Trek Fans are extremely acute at pointing out continuity problems, and Nemesis had alot, Datas' Emotions, What happened to Lore, Wasnt Worf an Ambassador, just to name a few, these issues totally ruin a Star Trek movie this is something that Treks don't have a problem with because they know it is extremely important. Also I fail to see y you would relese this right ontop of LOTR II that was a marketing problem and is why i beleive it did not perform well. The story started off nicely, totally died with the dinner with Picard and Shinzon, then picked up again, i hate to say it but part of that movie made me sleepy. People hark over Stuart Baird but all in all his directing was fine, John Logan on the other hand, his script was a disaster, pretty good story had a lot of continuity problems and he couldn't keep a balanced plot, and to make it worse they took out scenes which would've helped the transistions a lil better. the acting was superb by those who infact acted. not a bad movie, just not the best, not a good idea to hire two out f franchise people to helm your movie.

But anyone who knows Star Trek will notice something interesting. This particular movie has a feel similar to a previous Star Trek movie. To me, while the plot line is strong, and using the Romulans for the first time since we met the Borg, it feels a lot like the Wrath of Khan.
Still a good movie. I recommend it.",1055894400,,353,4.205882352941177
1465014,3,B00005JLRT,"As an avid fan of Star Trek the Next Generation I was really looking forward to the release of this film. It had all the elements of a really good Star Trek film but it was lacking something. The plot was sub par and it took me a long time to really get in to what was happening. The movie dragged and I couldn't wait for it to be over. If it wasn't for the fact that it is a next generation movie I probably wouldn't have even given it 3 stars.
The problem is that the storyline was one that could have been handled in a normal episode. In order for a story to be worthy of a movie it needs to have the complexity and drama of Star Trek First Contact (my favorite movie of all time). First Contact succeeded where Nemesis failed. Nemesis did not draw you in to the characters; I really didn't care what happened to anyone, including those that were regular next generation characters.
The marriage scene was premature; I think that something like that would have been more effective at the end of the film. Perhaps have some tension leading up to it. The entrance of the characters could have been more dramatic if it had not happened all at the beginning.
All in all, as a star trek fan you still must see this film but don't expect greatness. Its sad to think there probably won't be another next generation film to redeem this one and it will have to go out in such a dismal fashion.",1055808000,,1387,4.2377358490566035

1465016,3,B00005JLRT,"I must confess that I'm not a huge Star Trek fan.  I've seen about half of the movies, and used to watch Deep Space Nine and an occasional episode of Voyager.  But, when a Star Trek movie comes out, there is enough interest in me to want to give it a chance.  So, when Nemesis came out on DVD I rented it and gave it a spin.  I was disappointed.
Near the beginning of the movie there is an attack on the Romulan Senate killing everyone.  We shift to the crew of the Enterprise where Riker (Jonathon Frakes) is getting married to Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Picard (Patrick Stewart) gives a nice best man speech.  When this is concluded and everyone is back on the Enterprise, Picard gets a message from Captain Janeway (from Star Trek Voyager) to engage in a diplomatic mission to Romulan.  On the way to Romulan they discover an odd signal coming from another planet and the Enterprise stops to investigate.  The signal is a disassembled android that appears to be an earlier version of Data (Brent Spiner) named B-4 (clever, yes?).  The Enterprise continues on to Romulan and upon arrival they learn that the situation has changed.  There is a new power, and it stems from a Remen uprising.  The new power is a man named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  He is a human (not Remen), but was raised among the Remens.  He is also a clone of Picard.
This throws all sorts of possibilities for the rest of the film, and the diplomatic mission has changed completely because of the new circumstances.  There are scenes of action and some of fairly good.  Some parts of the movie were interesting, but as a whole it felt like the movie failed on some level.  As I said, I'm not a Trekkie, so I can't speak for how the movie fits into the larger picture of the Star Trek universe, but as a movie Nemesis just wasn't that good.  I wish that I could give more of a positive review, but the movie was not that interesting or compelling.  I cannot recommend Star Trek: Nemesis.  If you are a fan of Star Trek and absolutely must see everything with the Star Trek name on it, then rent with with no expectations and you might be pleased.  If you are only looking for a decent science fiction movie, look elsewhere.  The quality is not here.",1055808000,,2212,4.409876543209877

And they do in ""Star Trek: Nemesis,"" a good, but not perfect 10th entry in the ""Star Trek"" movie series. Director Stuart Baird (Executive Decision) keeps a dark, violent tone throughout the film, a welcome element after the decidedly too cheery ""Star Trek: Insurrection."" The story is about the Romulans being taken over by an evil human-reman experiment, Shinzon, who happens to be a clone of Picard. Soon it is discovered that Shinzon hopes to take over the Romulan and Human races and probably rule the galaxy. That is, if the only man who knows him best can stop him: Picard. There is tons of action and the best special effects in the series. Shinzon is a great villain and is almost up there with Khan and General Chang. The movie isn't quite as good as the other even-numbered Treks, but it's definitely better than the odd-numberes ones (for those who don't know, the even-numbered Trek movies are usually better than the odd-numbered ones).

I didn't like seeing Data decompiled so to speak, although if it isn't over (which out of all of us here I seem to be one of few)and I hope it isn't! that he will somehow recompile back into his normal old self and rematerialize again.

The only challenging element of 'Nemesis' is the challenge to decide which component of the ""creative"" process produced the worst contribution to the whole. The script was a convoluted, amateurish mess, producing (admittedly derivative) tripe that was not so much an homage to Trek's history, as it was hard evidence of how far the franchise has fallen.
Stuart Baird, a legendary film editor, shows us all why you should stick to what you're good at. His puzzling overuse of EXTREME closeups makes one wonder if he was playing with a new camera and didn't realize that it was ""on"", and the ""empathic trance"" scene with Troi was so poorly lit and photographed, it looked like an OUTTAKE from an Ed Wood film (""Nah, I'd be embarrased to have people see that!""). Of the ten Trek ""films"", only three (The Motion Picture, II, and VI) were made by actual FILM DIRECTORS, and it shows.
Save your money, and buy copies of the director's editions of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, or Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (the only two legitimate ""films"" of the ten entries in this
woefully underachieving franchise). If you already have copies of TMP and TWOK, buy more and ship them to the people who think that Nemesis somehow qualifies as good cinema, or even DECENT Star Trek.
If anyone wonders if this film franchise is dead, consider this: it began with Gene Roddenberry and Robert Wise in charge. 'Nemesis' gave us Rick Berman and Stuart Baird.

1465058,3,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis is a well plotted film and the exposition is laid out carefully as though it were an old fashioned film.  However, as infuriating as it may be to Trek fans and filmgoers alike, it does manage to the impossible even as far as Star Trek is concerned.  It's scored brilliantly by Jerry Goldsmith, Star Trek's musical god, this does the film justice because the score makes it appear as though the entire film from beginning to end is larger than life and makes it partially accessible to children only in some scenes though.  Data's counterpart B4 as pointless as this plot device is, Brent Spiner's performance in scenes with himself and himself provide another point of reassurance that the film is not completely bad while not being the best.  The film's best plotline interwoven in the story is the film's sense of family.  The family is growing and therefore growing apart which in a way makes this an acceptible swan song for the Next Generation crew.  The digital aspects of the film deliver and deliver well.  The film's true problem is the longevity of the Trek franchise, it has been beaten to death. The writers no longer emphasize the scientific and brain tingling aspect of Star Trek, they have fleshed it inside and out to make it an action exploitation film which does not fly well.  It's already got a narrow audience enough as it is that is narrowing even more.  Those intelligent aspects of Star Trek are the reason why we've loved it so hard and for so long once those things are gone, the franchise has lost its main fan base.  I remember being a small child when the Next Generation debuted and watching it all the way to its end and it was and still is an extreme pleasure to watch.  I even got the little kid kick from the beginning title sequence of the show and still do sometimes.  But, all the way through Nemesis, seeing how bad everyone aged and how it just all seemed so tired and run of the mill, was not an enjoyable aspect for me.  It is time for Star Trek to reinvent itself in a more up to date and intelligent fashion for secure survival of its future, should there be one.",1055289600,3,2125,4.488311688311688

We snuck into this film late one night after watching ""The Two Towers"" -- and you know what?  It wasn't even worth the money we didn't pay to see it.
This is by far the most slap-dash godawful mess of a film bearing the words ""Star Trek"" that has ever been made.  Whether it's Picard doing a Mad Max impression as he drives his land rover at breakneck speed to outrace the villians, or the long (very long) and boring (very boring -- the pacing of these scenes make you think the very first ST movie was an MTV video) sequences between Picard and his ""Nemesis"" you'll swear you're in some kind of ST hell.  Nothing makes any sense here: from supposed bright leaders of a country watching (and not otherwise moving) as someone sets a bomb in front of them, activates it, and then walks away (boy, do I want *these* guys as my enemies :>) to a ""sacrifice"" ending that you can see coming an hour or three away (the movie seems like it takes four hours) you won't believe a thing you see or hear.
Prior to making this movie Stewart was pooh-poohing rumors this was the last film: as soon as he saw the released product he promptly announced he wouldn't be playing Picard anymore.  I think that about says it all.
It's a pity the series is going to end with a whimper and not a bang, but I suspect completists are going to have to have this in their collection, just as I am sure they will never take it off the shelf to watch more than once.

1465062,5,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis, the Tenth and perhaps last of the Star Trek theatrical films, directed by Stuart Baird, focuses on the idea of what makes up ones own personality through the course of events and actions that effect our life?  If altered, can they be changed or are we bound by some unknown destiny we cannot foresee?  Patrick Stewart returns as Captain Jean-Luc Picard along with the rest of the original ""Next Generation"" cast.  His adversary: a twenty-four year old clone of himself named Shinzon (Tom Hardy), who was created by the Romulan empire in the hopes of killing Picard and taking his place.  But the plan was scrapped and Shinzon was forced to live out most of his life on the dark, desolate, dillithium mining planet of Remus, where he slowly began plotting his revenge: the total annihilation of earth.
  Strong performances abound in this truly grand epic, including Tom Hardy as Shinzon, who does a spectacular job going nose to nose against Patrick Stewart's legendary acting abilities, while still managing to hold his own in a scene together.  The film also boasts an impressive story, including a unique subplot about Data (Brent Spiner) and his newfound brother, B-4 (also played by Spiner).  Other highlights include the much anticipated wedding between Will Riker and Deanna Troi as well as Data's rendition of Irving Berlin's ""Blue Skies"" at the party afterwards.  And with strong character development, a tremendous score by Jerry Goldsmith (one of his best), some exciting action sequences, including an all terrain vehicle chase (with Picard behind the wheel) and an all out space battle between the Enterprise and the Scimitar (Shinzon's cloaked vessel), you've got yourself a film that's has it all.
  So then what happened at the box office?  Many people are still scratching their heads as to why Star Trek: Nemesis ended up becoming the lowest money making Trek film of the entire franchise, which was previously held by Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.  A major factor had to be the release date on December 13th (2002), which pigeonholed the film in-between the release dates of Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets as well as The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers, two of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.  It would almost seem like suicide to release a film anywhere near either of them.  Still others contend that the downfall occurred due to the franchise exhausting itself with all the different television series that have been released over the years, burning itself out in the process.  Some have even argued that there were just too many parallels between Nemesis and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.  But no matter if you're an optimist or a pessimist, the question remains:

  Can something be done to help save the franchise?
  A popular idea (which this reviewer happens to agree with) is to bring back the ever popular character, ""Q"" (made famous on the tv series) and make a film using him as the main focal point.  Played flawlessly by actor John de Lancie, ""Q"", an omnipotent superbeing, would be able to take the Enterprise on a journey the likes of which we, the filmgoing public, have never seen or imagined.  He also has the potential to appeal to both Trek and non-Trek fans alike.  ""Q"" is always at his best when matching wits against Picard.  Their chemistry together is just perfect.  With all his amazing powers (the ability to make anyone or anything appear as well as taking anyone anywhere in the universe), the possibilities are endless as to the kind of story that could be made for a possible Star Trek XI.  And although this doesn't seem likely now, one can remember a similar experience with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier when everyone thought it would also be the last installment.  Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker) has been saying for virtually every TNG picture, that ""Q"" will eventually show up in one of them.  ""Q"" could do for Star Trek XI what the Borg did for ""First Contact.  But is it too late?  Let's hope not.
  The Star Trek: Nemesis DVD also has some rather interesting extras, including an audio commentary by director Stuart Baird, who speaks in an almost soft whisper as he shares his thoughts about the film and what he was forced to cut out (such as Riker playing his trombone or more scenes with Data's cat, Spot).  Four featurettes and a photo gallery are also present, each discussing different aspects of the film, from directing, character development, action, special effects, and even a small possibility, by Patrick Stewart himself, for a potential sequel.  Many will find the nine ""deleted scenes"" section on the DVD fascinating.  Highlights include an intimate discussion between Picard and Data (who looks at the Captains flute from ""The Inner Light"" tv episode) about getting older, a second rape scene on Troi by Shinzon in a turbolift (which was partly shown in the Nemesis theatrical trailer), and an extended ending which shows a new first officer taking over for Riker (who is leaving with Troi to become Captain of the starship Titan), as well as Picard's Captain's chair finally being fitted with automatic seatbelts.
  So show your support and pick up this DVD today.  There are still many more stories to be told with the Next Generation crew of the starship Enterprise.  Let them be made into a reality on the big screen.

Aside from the brief wedding scene there is no warmth, no humor, no interesting locales or character interaction and the villian, who seems to have three-fourths of the film's dialogue, is neither menacing nor interesting, just an arrogant jerk.  I wanted more Worf and Riker!!!  There was a lot of action, but it amounted to nothing more than a prolonged space battle differing from episdodes only in that it was much louder and considerably longer.  In contrast to the exotic and colorful settings of the Star Wars films, the masterful action sequences of the Matrix, and the dynamic characters and villians of the X-Men, this dead in the water bomb makes Star Trek look tired, uninspired and down for the count.

 Judging it as a movie in general, I would have to say that it is pretty good with some great action scenes and interesting characters. Judging it as a Trek movie, I would have to say that it is not so great.
 The Trek universe is so large and yet the only story they could come up with is quite obviously a rip-off of previous Trek movies most notably ""Wrath of Khan"". There are so many other great stories that could have been done so much better.
 One of the things I love most about TNG is the relationships between the crew and this movie seemed to leave that out for the most part. It focuses mainly on Picard and Data, what about the rest of the crew? They are there, but not much. Since this was touted as the ""final generation movie"" you'd think they would have done something that involved the entire crew.

This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth.  Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly.  The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame.  One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome.  But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable.  And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin.

1465125,4,B00005JLRT,"The Star Trek movie franchise oscillates from high adventure to mindless action. This movie is partway between the two. As a small mercy, it hasn't degenerated in the ""dark sets"" tendancy of TV science-fiction yet. It is a weird mix of : mindless and pointless action (even pointless sex, which is unusual for a Star Trek movie), pulp fiction, Trekkian clichs, a couple of TNG ""best of"", and what I thought were some self-aware parodies of Trekkian clichs (unless the screenwriters are so absolutely braindead that they don't realize they've made enormous absurd clichs as part and parcel of their story, but even then it's still funny, just really sad too). It doesn't know what it wants to be.
Of course, there has to be plot holes the size of Quebec (why were the aliens on the planet where they found the android firing on them ? how can they detect positronic signatures this far away ? how did LaForge find the theleron radiation ? how did Shinzon get a ship like this ? these are not fatal plot holes, but need explanation), an archenemy, a new weapon, and stereotypical Romulan treachery.
To be fair, there are some great scenes. The first three scenes are hilarious, for this Star Trek fan anyway. The space fight scene is great (and parodies the two-dimensional space combat on Star Trek, once again if they are parodying). The photography is great, especially on the alien planet. And who can forget the flying Data ? Come on, that was just too much fun.
Its underlying theme of conditioning not being more influential than genetics is a refreshing one - against so many sappy movies that preach that ""all you need is love"" and that nature can be changed by a plot device, this more realistic view is promising. Too bad it is supported by no other sophistication, just action. On par with First Contact - at least its bastardization of the Romulans is not as bad as First Contact's bastardization of the Borg.
The director really likes ""German expressionism"", as he strenously tells us all through the commentary. Apparently the enemy vessel was made under that style. I have no idea what German expressionism is, and it looks kindof absurd in a science-fiction setting, but well.

1465127,1,B00005JLRT,"This movie was horrible. I put off seeing it in the movies and now I know why.
1) Spiner should have his name as the first one we see. He is the major character in almost all the Next Generation movies and the rest of the crew takes second fiddle to him, even the captain.
2) Poor scripting makes for bad comedy. Picard wanting to peel out in an 24th Century SUV is so out of character for him. Worf always finds a way to be aboard the Enterprise for all the movies even though he was assigned to DS9 and eventually became Klingon Ambassador to the Federation. Where does he find the time?
3) The Romulans used to be this enormous  threat and weary ally to the Federation and they simply bow down to Shinzon? Since when did they loose their backbone?
4) The space battles were the only redeeming factor abou the film. They looked great. But to believe that the enterprise lasted as long as it did against Shinzon's ship suspends belief.
5) Shinzon was not much of a baddie, he just wanted to be accepted  by Picard. But he was a bit better than F. Murray Abraham in Insurrection. Nobody beats Richardo Montobaun as the ultimate trek movie baddie with Christopher Plummer a close 2nd.

I could keep going, but you probably read some of the other reviews. It's a repetition of ST2 but without any link to the TNG universe. This movie rates just above the worst TNG episode ever ""Shades Of Grey"". I am disappointed in the way Trek is going.

1465130,2,B00005JLRT,"Few fans of Star Trek have been more rabid in the adulation of all things in the Star Trek universe than I.  What I have noticed is that the various television shows have uniformly showed better acting, scripting, and dialogue than the Star Trek movies have.  This is rather surprising since you would expect with the colossal budgets that the film directors and producers have that they could crank out better material than what routinely has appeared on the small screen.  Unfortunately, this has rarely been the case and in STAR TREK NEMESIS, the trend toward big screen bores continues.  It is almost as if the writers are fearful of leading the Enterprise into any of the novel territory that TNG, DS9, VOYAGER, and ENTERPRISE most often went. Instead, these writers seem content merely to borrow the ideas that proved hits on television, but have forgotten what it was that made these ideas hits in the first place.  In NEMESIS, a villain appears (Tom Hardy)who has a grudge against Starfleet (Khan from THE WRATH OF KHAN & Soren from GENERATIONS) and proceeds to show just why he fails to deliver his plans for revenge or conquest.  At least Ricardo Montalban (Khan) and Malcolm McDowell (Dr. Soren) had a penchant for allowing the audience to peek under the mask of villainy to identify the underlying motivation that must be there if the audience is to click with that villain.  Tom Hardy as Praetor Sinzon comes across as woefully unmotivated.  He can't seem to make up his mind whether he wishes to cross swords with Captain Picard or to destroy the earth for the glory of the Romulan Empire.  If the former, then the fact that he is a clone of a younger Picard does not in and of itself imbue his character with sufficient motivation to do anything with relation to Picard.  If the latter, then he ought to hate the Romulans since they had tormented him for years and should be thus unwilling to cover Romulus with glory.  As a villain worthy of boos and hisses, Hardy's Sinjon barely rates a single boo or hiss.  He comes across as a peevish schoolboy who seems singularly unsuited to lead a predator race.
The Star Trek writers on television had no problem coming up with exciting scripts for the many two part episodes that resonate even today.  If NEMESIS had been written as a straight science fiction outer space movie in a non-Star Trek setting, would it have even been made?  Possibly part of the problem is that the second generation Star Trek crew is showing their age, just as did Kirk, Spock, and McCoy when they made the leap from the small to the big screen.  Unless the writers can refrain from borrowing from a finite bag of used plots, then they might be better off shifting focus to the newest generation of Starfleet, Captain Archer of ENTERPRISE.",1054684800,2,2778,4.675564681724846

This Shinzon fella better be glad that he wasn't up against Kirk, because the movie would've only been about 5 minutes long.  Shinzon would've been dead after the first minute, and the last 4 minutes would be Kirk, Spock, and McCoy talking about how much of a joke Shinzon was.  There are a number of scenes that (if you're familiar with them) you can tell were taken from the other movies.  So to put it plainly, I would call it an average Star Trek movie.

Why was Wesley Crusher at the wedding sitting next to his mother in Star Fleet uniform no less? Everyone who watched the series knows he became something other then human and joined with the traveller. Right off the bat this unexplained cameo had me scratching my head.
What was the purpose of the whole dune buggy chase? If B4 (Data's new brother) was supposed to be found by Captain Piccard and company why would these unknown aliens suddenly attack? Who were these aliens? Why did this whole chase resemble something out of Mad Max? Where did the new android come?
Why was Data back to his old stoic self? What happened to the emotion chip? Why was he suddenly having problems understanding the human condition again? We all saw him cry for his cat when he found it alive. We all saw him show a big range of emotions in the last few films. The chip is never even mentioned.
Geordi does nothing in this film. Beverly does nothing in this film. Worf does nothing in this film (er uh'm he shoots a gun in the dune buggy chase). Riker does nothing in this film. Deana gets mind raped and somehow later uses her telepathic abilites to locate a cloaked Romulan ship, other then that, she does nothing. It's a very poorly thought out Data and Piccard show.
Hey Piccard clone.... you need a full tranfusion (of what is never quite explained) from Piccard to stop your accelerated cellular degeneration. Hmmm, here is an idea. Grow another clone, activate the aging correctly (so the problems you have don't occur in it) and then get your transfusion from it.  Might be smarter then bring Piccard all the way from the Fereration to kick your butt. I never could quite understand your beef with the Federation anyway. I think you would exact revenge on the Romulans first, then go after Earth.
The ships seem to be looking more like Star Wars vehicles and less like Federation ships. The Janeway cameo was really done poorly. Killing off Data was the worst descision ever, even if you did leave him a replacement in B4.
Even watching the deleted scenes didn't help this stinker make sense. In fact I think they could have cut much more, at least two hours worth. Oh, yeah, by the way, it's a two hour film.",1054598400,,2238,4.553349875930521

Nemesis, despite excellent effects and cinematography, and fine performances by the cast, falls into the latter category.
Villain with special link to one major character endangers Enterprise. Romulans may or may not responsible. Villain almost triumphs. Enterprise in dire peril. Picard pulls a brilliant last minute strategy out of the hat. Villain perishes on the bridge of his exploding spaceship. (I hope I'm not giving away too much here). Does that sound familiar?",1054512000,,681,5.2
1465180,2,B00005JLRT,"First, the good:
1. Special Effects were amazing, as always.
2. The acting was, for the most part, terrific.  It was good to see the cast cutting loose.  The melodrama present in the first few seasons was gone (it made a reappearance in the first TNG movie) which was also good.
3. The story could not fit in a single episode, unlike Generations and Insurrection, also very good.
Then, the bad (brace yourself for length:
1. Inconsistencies.  As I said, I am no fanboy, but I could pick out dozens of inconsistences.  The least of which being technology that is present in the Trek timeline, but not utilized in this movie. Convenient that the technology would have altered the present. This is lazy, lazy writing.
2. The villain was pointlessly evil and stupid.  A person does not rise to a position of domination over billions of people, and then gloat over a single ships destruction.  Again, lazy writing, as this EXACT SAME PREMISE is present in dozens of episodes.  Villain almost destroys Enterprise. Enterprise crew constructs plan.. you know the rest.
3. Troi gets weird.  She magically displays abilities far and away different than anything she has ever displayed before.  They were even conveniently made up AFTER the [stuff] hit the fan.
4. He looked nothing like Patrick Stewart. Lazy casting job.
5. Where did the Remans come from? Why is there no mention of them EVER?
6. The Super Ship of Death and Pain was a terrible, terrible plot device.  Come ON. Super Ship of Death and Pain is a too common a theme, why not something more sublte?
7. Speaking of plot devices.  The little transporter.  I didn't question it's existence.  I really, really didn't.  I am not a trek nerd, but this thing was a terrible, lame contrivance. Lazy writing, AGAIN.
8. Leader of Romulus? Please. A militaristic society doesn't kneel down like scared puppies like that.
9. Three on one and they still get the snot beaten out of them?

1465182,2,B00005JLRT,"As everyone knows this is the last TNG movie, so essentially the last movie in the best series that I've ever seen on television. The special effects are excellent; some of the action is really good; Picard is awesome as always...but other than that...
This movie was an incredible disappointment for me. The plot is thin, the notion of character determined by genetics, which has the potential to really become interesting, instead is reduced to triteness because it no one ever explores it beyond the basic ideas that everyone already has about it, and the whole thing basically feels dissociated from the rest of the series.
For some reason, all of the actors seemed fatter now.
And that would be okay, but it's just that there is nothing monumentally final about ""a generation's final journey."" This feels like an extended episode--admittedly, a criticism often brought against all Star Trek movies--but for this one I think it's spot on. It's a substandard sci-fi action movie that lacks TNG's affinity for philosophical discussion, deep plotlines on two-part episodes, and involvement of the entire cast. Generations was about paradise and expulsion, and finding one's self and the believable insanity of Malcolm McDowell, and Data finding his emotion and it had Klingons and space battles and the Nexus. First Contact was about sophisticated plotlines where the action was integral and where our knowledge of the characters was drawn from the show. It was about visiting the past and uncovering the oft-alluded to, but never explicitly stated, trek elements. Insurrection was about love and immortality, about the exile of family. I don't know what Nemesis is about. Genes? That hardly receives sufficient interesting treatment. Family? Shinzon is a tacked on new character that we've never seen before, with no history with Picard. Endings? True, the sacrifice at the end is powerful, but there is this feeling that it has been wasted...like it could have been done for so much more. Ships have been on the verge of exploding hundreds of times in this show, so why this time did someone we love have to die? And Shinzon, this character with no history and in which we are not invested at all, is to insignificant to deserve the title of ""nemesis"". Even if the idea of nemesis alludes to selfness--the nemesis inside Picard--it's still to small, since when we actually see that realized we have no connection to him. The nemesis in TNG is the Borg, or Q--characters with incredible power, and intriguing minds, and mystique. Not some young guy who comes on the show with no history, and whom we are supposed to believe is remotely comparable to either of those entities, which are both possessed of history and demonstrated futuristic omnipotence.
I just don't buy it. This story is too narrow for a generations final journey. It's an anticlimax, and that is just such a tragedy.",1054339200,2,2886,4.9896265560165975
1465183,5,B00005JLRT,"When I first saw Nemesis in the movie theatre, I wasn't extremely happy with it. When I first went to see it, I was a little tired, having come just after getting out of work. I'd been anticpating it something fierce, and I was mildly disappointed with the unexplained appearance of Welsey, and Worf. (Wesley left ST:TNG to travel through space and time, and hadn't been seen for something like a decade, and Worf became the ambassador to the Klingon Empire at the end of DS9.)Anyway, apparently, Worf's new job sucked, and he punched a few of the wrong people, and Wesley decided to pop in for a few moments. Oddly he vanishes right after the crew's first scene. I would have liked him included in the memorial scene, as he was very fond of... him. (I'm trying hard not to spoil anything. I'm sure most of you already know it though...)The story flows somewhat differently than previous outings, and this time there's some extremely excellent action shots of the Enterprise-E in battle. Most of the 'dog-fighting,' if you could call it that with ships this big, are breath taking and in a couple cases, jaw dropping! Digital Domain took over the special effects, as ILM is busy with the other 'Star' franchise, I assume, but they certainly did a hell of a job, and are to be commended for their fine work. And I certainly didn't feel the SE's took a lead role, the story is still very much character driven, with the SE's taking a supporting role, which is a good thing. Patrick Stewart (Picard) shines in the movie, with Sirtis, Frakes and Spiner (Troi, Riker and Data in order) all receiving some fine supporting work. Data most of all, of course gets a lot of time, and a huge scene, but Riker, Troi and LaForge all have some great scenes, but I felt the rest of the cast didn't have enough to do in the movie, Worf, most of all, seems to get shafted. Shinzon is a great villian, and his interaction with Picard is nicely done from beginning to end. The film looks great, and the transfer is crisp and smooth throughout. I didn't notice any flaws at all, honestly. (And with a film this new, there sure shouldn't be, damn it.) The 5.1 surround sound is great, as is Jerry Goldsmith's film score. The extras include several deleted scenes, and it would have been nice to see them in the context of the film, but I'll take what I can get. The documentaries are nice, showing some of the making of the film, and thoughts of cast and crew. I haven't listened to Director Stuart Baird's commentary yet. All in all, the film may have flopped at the Box Office, but it's really well worth another look.

1465184,3,B00005JLRT,"As I watched the movie I couldn't help but obsess on all the unexplained questions. This movie has some of the laziest scripting I've ever seen.
For instance:
The Enterprise crew seems baffled as to how a human could end up in charge of the Romulan empire. Guess what. So was I and it's never really explained. Are we to just assume the Picard's genes are so superior that if placed on Romulus he would naturally take over the whole planet.
Why would the Romulan's help Shinzon with his coup, urge him to follow through with his bizaare plan and then turn on him the moment he starts putting his plan in motion?
Shinzon spent his childhood being tortured by the Romulan's so naturally he holds a deep hatred for... EARTH????
What do the Romulan's hope to gain by destroying the Earth?
Who built the Scimitar? Was it the Romulans or the Remians and how did they suddenly make this technological leap to build the most powerful starship ever? Why would the Romulan's give Shinzon charge of this ship since he seems to have no experience as a starship commander.
Who designed the Phazon generator to sit on the Scimitar's bridge? Doesn't that seem like an accident just waiting to happen.
How in the world did the Remian's think they were going to capture the Enterprise by beaming a half dozen soldiers aboard?
Why would the Romulan's build such a massive space cruiser and then fill it with no defense forces? Picard had little difficulty storming the ship SINGLE HANDEDLY.
Why did the Romulan's attack their OWN SHIP knowing it's power after giving it to Shinzon? Naturally they got their butts handed to them but it makes no sense.
If the Romulans can just start beeming people off the Enterprise at will why not just keep doing it until you capture the whole crew?

It is a bit of a clich of previous Star Trek moves but that's what brings people back to moves such as this one you can always expect the expected and some times the unexpected if you catch my drift.
 The movie was way better than  Star Trek Insurrection but not quite as good as First contact and I am not even going to compare it to captain Kirks generation because you will never have moves as good as them but that's a different topic all together. Now as far as graphics they where by far the best I have seen in a Star Trek movie, the ships the phaser fire and the battle scenes where all flawless. As far as the action there was plenty of it and the fighting scenes that involved Picard and Praetor Shinzon where darn good considering Picard is getting old. I also liked the part where Picard rams the Enterprise into the Schimitar that was a bit unexpected and probably got people sitting on the edge of there seats I know I was. And last but not least the scene where Data blows up the Schimitar and dies was sad but the part that actually brought a tear to my eye was the part after that scene when Counselor Troy hugs Riker and starts crying
Right through to the scene where they are all standing around drinking wine and telling story's about Data.
 All in all I thought it was really good how ever I did feel that it was rushed a little bit just falling under 2 hours. But I would most certainly give it 4.5 stars.

It's great in the sense that the film is a really fun picture to watch (especially the very impressive third act), but it's also aggravating in the sense of pacing.
They go, they stop. They go, they stop. Over and over (INCLUDING in the aforementioned very impressive third act).
I liked this film in the sense that I could have nitpicked it to death, but it was enjoyable enough to suspend my disbelief. But I will agree with other reviews that I have read that say that John Logan and Brent Spiner were trying too hard to re-create the feel of Wrath of Kahn.
On the DVD front, I will say that I like this film as well. Having recently watched First Contact, I noticed that (at least on my Pioneer Elite HDTV) there is a noticable improvement in visual quality. Images are much more vibrant and have much less noticable grain inherant in film to digital transfer.
The audio is also (not surprisingly) impressive. The surround channels are constantly active, from the normal background rumble of the ship, to the zipping of quantum torpedoes flying by.
I was a little disappointed in the extended/deleted scene catagory. I was really hoping that these deleted scenes would be fully-finished scenes, preferably re-inserted to the film. Neither of my hopes was met, and I think it was a large detriment to the film itself. Two of the scenes included would have drastically helped the character development of the film and setup the recurring themes to a little more satisfying extent.
Overall though, I can recommend this film to pretty much any Trekkie (and no, I don't call them Trekkers...), and anyone who might have a passing interest in Trek. It's a strong action flick in it's own right, and it DOES have a sense of higher morals (not a big sense, but it is there).",1054080000,,1820,4.637770897832818
1465209,4,B00005JLRT,"When ""Nemesis"" came out, I went to see it on the opening day, expecting nothing less than greatness. After all, the last film had left me somewhat unimpressed, and it seemed as though ""Insurrection"" was a movie that, honestly, could have just been a two part regular episode. The franchise realized this too, and they decided that Nemesis was going to have to be much more of an action movie - a movie with a villain we can all hate.
Well, Shinzon plays that role quite well, although the fact that he is the clone of Picard is a bit ludicrious. Plot holes aside, Shinzon fills in the gap that had been missing from Insurrection. He brings a certain aura of darkness into the film, from his looks to his voice and actions. His people, the Remans, also look magnificently dark. His intent is to destroy Earth to cripple the Federation, and the Enterprise (specifically, Picard), has to stop him before he gets there.
Patrick Stewart must have been bored with all of the speeches that he usually gives, because there are a couple of moments in the film when Picard is out of character (riding around in a dune buggy, anyone?) Even so, his acting talents are still up to par and he adds the life needed to keep this movie interesting. While there are scenes in which he will stop to take a philisophical standpoint, most of the movie is him making gutsy decisions that seem a bit out of place.
Aside from the great Picard/Shinzon rivalry, however, the only other character with real time in the movie is Brent Spiner, aka Data. This movie seems to have forgotten that he does now have an emotion chip, but that's forgivable, as the ending seems more touching when he is shown as making an ethical, noble decision in his quest to become more human.
But here the problems start to set in. Every other character from cast and crew is probably around for only 10 minutes, max. Fans of Micheal Dorn or Jonathan Frakes, or Marina Sirtis or Gates McFadden, will be sorely disappointed that their favorite characters did not get more screen time. After all, if this is ""a generation's final journey"", you would expect to see more of the generation included. This wasn't a large problem for me as I am a fan of Stewart, and there is plenty of him in the movie. But for those looking for Worf to get into a hand to hand fight, be warned. Even Riker's fight scene is short, confusing, and ultimately forgetable as the audience becomes more interested in the fight between Shinzon and Picard than anything else.
In a way, this movie does draw some aspects of the Next Generation to a close - Riker and Troi are finally going to tie the knot (although we never see it) and Riker is becoming captain of his own vessel. Data leaves, but in his place is the B4, so there's still something that could be developed there. The long standing rivalry between the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire may finally be coming to an end, although it really does seem to be wishful thinking.
So, in the end, what does this movie really accomplish? Aside from a view little wrap-ups, nothing really seems to be resolved, and I, for one, believe there will be at least one more movie in the franchise (after all, the promo said ""A generations final journey begins"", not ends). If it were truly the final movie, I'd say it was a slight disappointment. If, however, it's not, then I'd say it delievers plenty of action for the audience and opens up new directions for the crew.
P.S: Should another movie be made, I suggest using Q as the villain. John De Lancie always was the best mysterious supreme being.",1054080000,,3575,4.535603715170279

1465212,5,B00005JLRT,"Did I unjustly help ring the death knell of the ST:TNG movie franchise?
So, I need to admit... I passed on seeing ST: Nemesis in the theatres... and I'm not quite sure why. I don't think it was because there were a myriad of competing movies out at the same time... I don't think it was because I didn't have any interest in seeing another Trek movie... I think it was because of 3 reasons.
1. Minor reason. OK, I was a ST:TNG fan. I will admit. I loved each character. I enjoyed the original series with Kirk at al, but, lets face it... it was campy. I never got into Voyager, Deep Star 9 or whatever, and now, at 28, I'm just too busy to really invest time into watching an hour long drama every week on a regular basis (ala Enterprise). But I digress... yes, I always loved TNG. And, well... before the movie came out, there were rumors that they were going to kill off a main character. Well, I just didn't want to see that happen.
2. Major reason. The marketing for this movie was AWFUL. If I recall, the trailors focused more on the ""dune buggy on a bleak sun-bleached desert planet"" scene, eliciting memories of some of the more awful contributions to the Star Trek film legacy (namely Star Trek:5, and Star Trek: Insurrection). I'm sorry, but when I think ""Star Trek Movie"", I don't want a lot of planet-side action... I want epic starship battles. I want explosions, and hull breaches, and torpedos, and monumental clashes.
3. On top of it, there simply was ZERO buzz about this movie. Paramount spent, what, $2.73 on promoting this movie? If any Star Trek film killed the movie franchise, it wasn't ""Nemesis"", but the previous installment, ""Insurrection"".  Movie sequels and franchizes need to feed of the buzz and hype off the one before it, and let's face it folks, ""Insurrection"" was an awful movie, and ""Nemesis"" paid the price for it.
So, why am I writing this?
I just rented ""Nemesis"", and, well... dare I say, it's one of the three best movies in the series!!!! (behind The Wrath of Khan, and First Contact).
I was totally engrossed in the story line! The dune buggy scene WAS actually hokey, but was only a minor little side-bar, the villain was menacing yet complex, and I even felt some sympathy for the character. The special F/X were really good, the directing was competent, the mood was dark (Star Trek with a David Fincheresque twist!), the visuals were stunning, the interplay of the characters with the emphasis of ""family"" was indeed touching, the ending sacrifice actually worked, and the ending space battle between the Enterprise and some of the Romulan/Reman ships were some of the best captured on film for the entire franchise... be in a movie or a television show. It was EVERYTHING I could possibly want in a Trek movie...
THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE STAR TREK FRANCHISE!
So, I am sorry I didn't go see this movie in the theatre. I'm sorry that this great movie did not do so well in the theatres, and I'm sorry that because of it, there may never be another Star Trek:TNG movie again. And for that, I'm rather sad.
So, if you are a Star Trek fan that stayed away like I did, or a sci-fi fan in general... buy the DVD. Support the franchise. Maybe we can now make up the poor box-office receipts and potentially secure another Next Generation film somewhere down the line.",1053993600,2,3312,4.529215358931553
1465213,2,B00005JLRT,"I am a star trek fan and this movie has so much cheque and usage of techo mumbo jumbo words that it clearly lost the one thing that makes the previous star trek its true stamp of approval, and that is originality. It is acceptable if this movie was made as a typical tv episode but not as a grand final to end the star trek movie serie. Let me tell you some of the scene i find strange.
1) When Data said to Wolf that the arm he was holding appear to be a robotic arm and Wolf said 'very astute'. Now when do you ever see a Klingon (Wolf for that matter) use words like that? Not likely. What Wolf should of said was 'You think?'. That would of been funny and acceptable.
2) When the 'away' team was given coordinate by that ugly remus vice roy that included just about every key member. Why does both Picard and Riker need to beam down? One of them should of stayed on board in case it was a trap. There was no discussion of what would happen if something where to happen to the 'away' team. I suppose the enterprise would be waiting forever because no one would know what to do.
3) The 'shooting' scene with Picard and Data on the Zinatar warbird. How come neither of them got hit in the open?  There were more enamies and they were being hit left and right yet neither of the good guys got a single nick. That goes for the 'shooting' scene on the enterprise with Riker and Wolf. Did you see Riker just walk up to that docking hole and just crawl in (in the middle of constant shooting back and forth. You would think he would of got hit. Not only that, it was crazy to even attempt to go thru that hole in the middle of constant fire. He told Wolf to give him cover HA. That is so funny when he said that. The only people that seem to gotton hit are the crew with no names. I find these fighting scenes to be totally unrealistic since none of the main crew got hit other then DATA in the end.
4) DATA sacrifice in the very end because Captain Pikard just froze in the end. What if Data didn't help him in the end?  Would that mean everyone in the enterprise would of died? Yes they would, and the blood would of been on Picard's hand because he didn't do anything but froze there in the end. Then again, if he did act, both him and data would of died, so i guess its better to lose one then both.
In the end, i was rooting for the Remus Warbird Zinatar over the Ramulian warbirds since it was the Remus who were being liberated from the cruelty of the Ramulan and i have no respect for them. They seem like good people who's real goal should of been to conquer the Ramulans and make them dig the mines to see how they feel about it. I am for liberating the Rimens.
Do i recomment watching this movie...Yes, if your a diehard 'trekkie' fan. If your not, skip it and watch First Contact, then Insurrection.",1053907200,,2807,4.111111111111111
1465214,4,B00005JLRT,"Die hard Trekers will pick this one to death, but for the casual and steady viewers of Star Trek, this tenth entry of the movie franchise is a pretty good way to kill two hours. The TNG Enterprise 7 return by coming together for the wedding of Commander Will Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi. On route to Betazed for the rest of the nuptuals, the Enterprise is diverted (so what else is new) to the Romulan Neutral Zone to meet with the new Praetor, Shinzon. Turns out that Shinzon is Picard's clone and was supposed to replace Piccard as captain of the Enterprise as a Romulan spy. Before the project really got off the ground, the Romulan government pulled the funding from the project (been there, done that) and exiled the young Shinzon to Remus, the twin world to Romulus. There he was abused in the dilithium mines and vowed to get revenge on both Romulus and Earth. The special effects are spectacular, the acting is typical Trek. As for this being the lowest grossing Trek in franchise history, I blame the geeks that started posting the poison in chat rooms ten minutes after seeing the flick. True, there were some points that could have been scripted better, such as why didn't the fleet come looking for the Enterprise when they didn't pass through the ion cluster in a reasonable amount of time, but I enjoyed this one better than the last, Insurrection.",1053907200,,1366,4.625514403292181
1465251,4,B00005JLRT,"I've read the other ... reviews prior to buying this DVD, and I agree with most every one. I must say that if you are expecting The Matrix or Star Wars, this movie might not be for you. It is, after all, Star Trek - a show known not necessarily for special effects and action scenes, but for the real tug-at-your-heart storylines. I admit that before I went to see the movie, my opinion was already tainted by the movie reviewers, and I also admit that when I first saw this movie in the theatre, I was bored and did not like it one bit. The fact that I was in a non-digital, non-THX moviehouse has a lot to do with it, I'm sure. The picture overall was dark and it was a very unenjoyable experience as far as movies go. With that being said, I take all of that back now with this DVD release. The visuals are stunning, the colors are brilliant, and the acting was up to Next Generation standards. The special effects will blow you away. The plot was suspenseful and very enjoyable. The DVD extras add to the overall experience as expected (Makes me reconsider waiting for the DVD in the future, instead of going to the theatre!) Being a die-hard ""Trekkie"", I rate this movie four stars instead of five only because I have seen Star Trek TNG episodes on TV that, on occassion, have been better than the movies.",1053907200,,1310,4.329268292682927

One thing i did notice is that a lot of star trek stuff lately (including nemesis) deals with ""what it means to be human, and 'human qualities'..."" Which is one of the climactic statements made in the very first movie when Vger merges with a human to become more than just a machine, which incidentally is what has been going on with data since the very beginning.  I am almost sure that there will be another star trek movie, and i hope they choose to go in a new direction with the movie.  Some work in the Delta or Gamma quadrants would be nice, and incorporating other characters in a grand scale would really bring in viewers and satisfy the fans.

1465255,4,B00005JLRT,"This film had lots of what makes a good movie. Emotion, special effects, and a decent storyline.
It was nice to see all the cast together for (at least) one last romp through the galaxy, even though one member doesn't come home.
There was lots of emotion in this film as we dealt with some issues that haven't ever been addressed in the next generation 'universe'. The characters grapple with change, and moving on with grace and dignity.
The special edition DVD contains deleted scenes which really showed this side of the film, it's a shame they were deleted at all. I think this would have made for a much better theatrical release.
The special effects shots were awe-inspiring, with the space battle a great workout for the home theatre. I had one bad thing to say about the space battle that seems to be a recurring theme in the star trek movies. Why do they always get their butts kicked and have to rebuild the ship every single time? I guess they think that we can't have good conflict unless we see lots of sparks and chunks of titanium being blasted off the ship and then floating around in space. Of course, the battle sequence is phenomenal, but I just kept asking myself that question.
To sum up, this is probably the best next gen film yet. I hope they make a 'transition' film that includes members from casts of next gen as well as Voyager, and maybe even DS9. It's possible that they could even include some of Archer's crew from Enterprise as well, especially since their main foe are timetravellers!",1053820800,7,1518,4.564102564102564
1465256,5,B00005JLRT,"Not unlike many Star Trek fans, when I went and saw Star Trek Nemesis at the theater the first time, I was a little blanched by it because it seemed to be a disappointment based on four years of anticipation and all the hype leading up to its release.  Upon a second viewing at the theater a couple weeks thereafter I warmed up to this tale a little more.  And now we finally have the DVD where a third viewing for me has clinched this as one of the better Star Trek movies.  Paramount has finally decided to not put the screws to us once again by releasing a DVD with just the movie and a trailer; they have loaded this one down with as much as possible.
Many fans have made reference to the writer John Logan who wrote ""Gladiator"" and someone who has been a long time fan of Star Trek that he embedded this film with way too many references to previously filmed scenes.  While this may be the case, I do not think it detracts from the film in any way.  Overall, I believe John Logan, Rick Berman and Brent Spiner who are all credited with writing this trek tale, did a wonderful job of dealing with the particular issues that they wanted included and tossing in some of the best Star Trek silver screen space battles ever done.
Credits to of course the entire Star Trek The Next Generation's cast for their usual high standard performances and to Tom Hardy for his wonderful performance as Shinzon of Remus.  We're even treated to a guest performance by none other than Kate Mulgrew as ""Admiral"" Janeway, which leaves many a Star Trek fan to wonder where Voyager will lead to in the future...
The premise:
Going into this film, the Executive Producer of Star Trek Rick Berman knew there were particular aspects that they had to include in this film as part of the premise that this would be ""A Generation's Final Journey,"" which they did quite well to include leaving a huge possibility at the end of the film for this to ""not"" be STNG's final journey on the silver screen.
Shinzon of Remus, The Romulan Empires second and closest planet has managed to overthrow the Romulan Senate to include the Praetor and is now its Praetor.  Having ties with Captain Jean Luc Picard and a need to meet him, he sets into motion a plan that will draw the Federations flagship and her Captain to Romulus for a fateful meeting that will possibly herald the destruction of Earth and the Federation.
The DVD:
As referenced above, Paramount really outdid themselves with this particular release.  In past Star Trek film DVD releases we've received only the film and a trailer or two and for the past year or so they've finally been re-releasing the films as ""Special Editions.""
The cover art for the DVD is perfect.  In addition to the wonderful cover art the DVD case itself is new and different as well, with two clips for keeping the case closed which is fairly innovative!
The on screen menus for this DVD are nothing short of spectacular and probably the best I've seen so far for a Star Trek DVD.

1465257,3,B00005JLRT,"""Nemesis"" is heavy on action, light on plot, almost the exact opposite of ""First Contact"" which is my favorite Star Trek movie. However, this is a watchable film, and the movie certainly highlights the fact that by now the TNG characters all have wonderful chemistry with one another, and some of the characters' acting skills have greatly improved since the inception of the series. Patrick Stewart (whose acting skills have always been excellent in my opinion) turns in a bravo performance, as does Brent Spiner. The ""dune buggy"" scenes in the desert are lots of fun. However, how does this segment of the film square with the ""Prime Directive?"" I suppose we are destined never to know, but that's Hollywood. This is a minor quibble.

My main criticism of the movie is that I found the plot to be murky and the evil protagonist somewhat unfocused as regards his motivations and purpose. I also don't like the idea of ""good Romulans"" (spoiler omitted here). The best thing about the film is that it deals with the Romulans/Remans who I have always thought are the best ""Star Trek"" villains with the possible exception of the Borg.

If you are a Star Trek fan, you will like this movie. Those who are not will likely be less enthusiastic. RJB.",1053734400,,1243,4.723502304147465
1465258,4,B00005JLRT,"I'd been so disappointed in what had become of the Star Trek movie franchise and had heard so many bad things about _Nemesis_ that this is the only Star Trek movie that I didn't make it a point to go see in the theatre.  I actually hesitated to rent the DVD, but I figured I'd be bound to see it some time, better get it over with.  Well, I'm pleased to report that ""A Generation's Final Journey"" isn't actually all that bad.  It's not original by any means, but it doesn't make the gross mistakes of the rest of the TNG movies.
As Riker and Troi celebrate their wedding (finally!) and prepare to go off to Riker's new command on the Titan, Captain Picard receives a message that the Romulan Empire is making peace overtures to the Federation.  The Enterprise is the ship closest to Romulan Space (big surprise there), so Picard & Co. are sent to see what's the what.  Of course, all is not what it seems -- in more ways than one.
In a nutshell, _Nemesis_ reminded me of ""Wrath of Khan"" meets ""Best of Both Worlds"" with a little of ""The Undiscovered Country"" thrown in.  But if you're going to be derivative, you should definitely do your deriving from good material.  Certainly it helped the TNG franchise here.  The plot was understandable, without the excess elements that have cluttered the previous movies.  The characters were used well, without the former attempts to give everyone an important screen ""moment"" that was not necessarily in service of the plot.  There wasn't too much extraneous action, or attempts to make Picard into a Kirk-like action hero.  All in all, it viewed like a 2-part episode of the series.
The thing that _Nemesis_ lacks more than anything is chemistry.  The original series may not have been so artful or socially relevant, but it was often chock-full of emotional impact.  TNG was always a more cerebral show.  _Nemesis_ is true to that form, but that cerebral energy, I think, just doesn't translate well to the big screen.  I couldn't help but compare the big battle with the Kirk/Kahn stalk through the nebula in Start Trek II and find the current film lacking.  There's a meeting of minds here, but they're both very cold minds, lacking the passion of the original series' characters that made that show so great.
_Nemesis_ is certainly the best of the TNG movies.  It doesn't compare to any of the Nicholas Meyer works, however.  I'm glad I waited for the video release.",1053734400,10,2413,4.6376470588235295

It's a very rare bird, and a delicious experience, completely unlike any other Star Trek movie and different indeed from any other science fiction movie altogether. Unjustly maligned upon its release, I hope that eventually Star Trek: Nemesis will find its audience.

Otherwise, Riker would have been a skipper years ago. Picard is also losing his shipboard shrink--the newlywed Danna Troi Riker is taking that job on her husband's ship. The Riker wedding gives to Picard a happier mood throughout the film. He loses the wise but stern personality all but demanded by his Roman coin face in other ""TNG"" material--he jokingly addresses Riker as ""Mr. Troi"" at one point. Well, The Missus has always struck me as having a Daddy's Girl relationship with her captain anyway. But now the Rikers have one last mission with their soon-to-be ex-captain. And it's a doozy--a diplomatic mission to the Romulans. I guess it was inevitable--look at the way they joined the Alliance in the Dominion War in the last few ""DS9"" episodes. There's a cameo here by Kate Mulgrew as Admiral Janeway, who gives Picard the orders. Funny, it hadn't occurred to me she was senior to Picard. Maybe it's a case just like with Riker--Picard being satisfied with his posting and not wanting to get stuck with flag rank. That scene also renewed my anger at my cable provider--I missed the last two seasons of ""Voyager"" because Fox stopped syndicating the series and my cable guys couldn't be bothered to come up with a UPN channel. So I didn't get to see any of the episodes in which Cap'n Kate and her Merry Men come home. But be warned--this movie has the grittiness of the ""TNG"" Borg cycle. Romulan Praetor Shinzon is a younger clone of Picard who has patricidal urges and a nasty way of dealing with opposition--a ray which renders organic matter biologically inert. It would have been a cliche to call it a ""Medusa Weapon"", but you literally get turned to stone. The ultimate target--Earth. A weapon of mass destruction used by a fanatical dictator, first on his own domestic opposition, then on a foreign target. Well, they do say that a lot of sci fi is current events imprinted upon the future. Oh yeah, Mr. Data, right? On the way to the Riker-Troi wedding on Betazed, they follow the trail of a positronic signature to a planet and find an early model of the android that the current one hadn't known existed. They find him literally torn limb from limb, they put Humpty Dumpty back together again, turn him on, and he works. Which gives Data a new family project to deal with--if you will recall, his ""daughter"" died before her time, and we all know what kind of paragon of familial virtue big brother Lore turned out to be. Fortunately, this elder sibling is innocent and naive, like we remember Data himself from the early ""DS9"" episodes. There's a lot of action here, things go kerblooey and kerblam, there's even a dune buggy chase scene on the desert planet where they find Data's big bro, in which everyone thunders around on machines you'd swear from the sound all have Mopar V-8s.

Anyway, I purchased the DVD and just watched it again. Wow. It's SO much better the second time. It's one of those movies that you just need to let sink in to enjoy. I now consider it to be one of the better movies in the set. Rent it, and you'll see or just buy it.
Much better the second time.",1053648000,,499,4.154639175257732
1465381,3,B00005JLRT,"The plot of ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" comes down to three situations. First, and most importantly, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) discovers that he not only has a clone (Tom Hardy) who was created by the Romulans by raised by the Remuseans, but that the enterprising Shinzon has become Praetor of the Romulan Empire, which has a weapon that can destroy all life on Earth. Second, in an obvious parallel, Data (Brent Spiner) discovers yet another of Dr. Soong's prototype androids, named B-4 (also Spiner). Third, and finally in more ways than one, Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) are finally getting married. This 10th Star Trek film, and four in the STNG part of the series, has its moments but is ultimately less than satisfying.
Part of the problem is that even before the film's climatic death scene we are already aware that we have another Star Trek death that is not really death scene. Yes, this is certainly more plausible than the first one in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan""/""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"" but that it is at the expense of the shock and emotional impact the first time around. Consequently, the big payoff rings hollow, which is never a good sing for a major theatrical release.
Another part of the problem is that the cast is so large that few of them have much of value to do. Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton) has been standing by for several films mainly to ask Data what he is doing so the android can explain, Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) waits for casualties to show up in sick bay, and Worf (Michael Dorn) is at least good for a few laughs with the comments he makes in his cups while everyone is toasting Riker and Troi. As far as the movies go, STNG has boiled down to Picard and Data, and the rest are along for the ride, posing stiffly and formly in the background. That being said, ""Nemesis"" finally gives Counselor Troi the main supporting role and a couple of scenes when she proves she can give as well as receive. But overall there are two many cast members sitting around with little or nothing to do; compare this with the series finale ""All Good Things...""
Finally, there are just too many significant gaps in the thinking of the main characters. Picard and his clone think they understand each other as if in the future the nature versus nurture issue has gone the way of safety belts being required on alll chairs on spaceships. Yes, having a clone is creeping. Yes, having your clone serving in a Romulan slave pit is disturbing. But the idea that the result is a younger version of itself was never legitimated by novels/films like ""The Boys From Brazil."" This is supposed to be the future, but the ""science"" here is about on par with a 1950s film. If I, who know virtually nothing about science in general or cloning in particular can see the holes in this logic, than Picard's Starfleet Academy training should serve him in much better stead.
Now that we are apparently here at the end of the road for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" it might be appropriate to conduct a post mortem and consider the question of why the theatrical films were never as good as any of the two-part episodes of the television series. The short explanation is they went for bigger (e.g., the Borg rewrite human history) rather than better. What is so puzzling is why a creative staff that came up with several solid story lines almost every season for many years could not cut it when it was required to come up with one very good idea every few years. ""Star Trek - Nemesis"" has the characters of STNG but neither the style nor the substance; what does Picard driving a intergalactic dune buggy have to do with why we loved this television show? Plus, the lighting makes Data's skin look really weird. At least we have the original STNG out on DVD now.",1053561600,124,3829,4.591240875912408
1465382,4,B00005JLRT,"Captian Picard didn't seem to be himself at all, and there's a few hard strives for comedy within the first twenty minutes. The set-up bothers me also though... Why would they want to piece B-4 back together AND give him all of Data's memories after how Lore turned out? I can tell you why, because that's the only way they could kill Data (Yes, Data dies *cries*) at the end and still have his legacy live on in some way.
Shinzon and his legion of Remans are obviously inspired by classic vampire literature (Shinzon gave off a distinct Dracula vibe in many of the scenes he was in). No really, look! Shinzon needs Picard's blood to live and he and his ilk are not fond of the light (not to mention a few smaller things that you'd have to see to figure out). I also received the distinct impression of a Weegie Board when Diana was probing the Viceroy's mind for the Scimitar's location.
None of this really made Nemesis a bad movie, although I was afraid it was going to be for the first thirty minutes or so. It does have a pretty interesting plot, along with some truly brilliant moments. But with the death of Data and the loss of Ryker and Diana, I fear we are coming to the end of Next Generation....

Date has a brother android that looks just like him and it's not explained too well where he came from either. What the film has going for is the special effects, action and the performances of Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. The under-rated StarTrek  First Contact is a much better film and the best of the next generation movies. If they couldn't of done better than that they shouldn't of made more Next Generation movies.

1465447,5,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek is one of those things that will never go away. And i pray it stays that way. After the extended 'episode' like 'Insurrection' one would definitely agree that this franchise needed to kick it up a whole batch of notches to redeem itself. 'First Contact' gave us what we craved and 'Insurrection stole it back from us. This time 'Nemesis' hands it back with all the fixin's. The plot and character development has been bashed by some reviewers who dwell on their preconceptions rather than reality. The 'Nemesis' plot was outstanding with twists and turns all over. We know Shinzon (Captain Picard's clone) is bad, but it is interesting to see his development as he struggles with finding out who he really is, and who he could have turned out to be. He wanted life and liberation, but found out that both would come at a great cost. The action sequences are astounding and makes any recent Star Wars battle look like a watered down special effects puddle. Tom Hardy (Shinzon), acted like no other. He made Shinzon his own, and it was good. His performance is probably the most under-rated enemy performance of all time. He was breath-taking in his ability to portray curiosity, hate, and lust. I can't wait for another Star Trek movie!!",1053475200,,1246,4.720183486238532
1465448,4,B00005JLRT,"The Romulan Senate has been usurped by an ambitious young leader from the planet Remus, a mining planet whose population has long been under the thumb of the Romulans. The new government of the Romulan Empire has invited the Enterprise to visit Romulus to discuss a possible peace negotiation between the Empire and the Federation. When the crew of the Enterprise reaches Romulus they find, to their shock, that the Romulans' new leader, Preator Shinzon (Tom Hardy), is not Romulan or Reman, but appears to be Human. He is, in fact, a clone of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), the product of an abandoned plot to place a Romulan spy in a key Starfleet position. Preator Shinzon is in possession of a cataclysmic weapon of mass destruction and has a new plan to defeat the Federation. Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must discover his true intentions and stop him before he is able to unleash this weapon upon humanity.

""Nemesis"" is darker in theme and in appearance than previous Star Trek films. The idea of characters struggling with their alter egos pervades the story. Both Captain Picard and Commander Data deal with characters who are in many ways identical to themselves, but have very different personalities and values. Preator Shinzon is genetically identical to Captain Picard, but is violent, arrogant, and sociopathic, supposedly due to an abusive and difficult childhood. Data is faced with an android that calls itself ""B4"", an apparent prototype version of himself. B4 differs from Data less in his temperament than in his intelligence. He is a mentally challenged version of Data, and his ignorance and naivete causes him act in ways that Data would not. ""Nemesis"" is a very good-looking film. The art direction is innovative and excellent, and the battles between spacecraft are stunning. ""Nemesis""' writers have made the very wise choice -long overdue in Star Trek movies- of making this film like a high octane episode of the television series instead of writing some overblown implausible save-the-universe plot.

""Nemesis"" is recommended for its good looks and its restrained story that manages to avoid complete absurdity.",1053388800,3,2170,5.109859154929578
1465449,5,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis was a good movie despite what everyone says about it. It most likely is the Next Generation's Final Journey and it a fitting end to a good series. because lets face it, only die hard Trekkie's are into DS9 and Voyager. Im my opinion, Star Trek ends for a while with the end of this movie. Enterprise is another avenue, but again is not as popular as The Next Generation. It would be nice if one final Next Generation was made, but I don't think it will happen. Star Trek needs to unfortuantely disappear again into deep space for another 10 or 15 years and be remember, but not forgotten and then a new series or movie can possibly come out with a good story that will enterain viewers yet again to the Star Trek saga. I think that is the only way it will be able to live long and prosper the future. Its been overdone and needs a slight rest. To watch Nemesis is sad because I think we all know deep down, this is the last Trek we will be on for quite a while. A job well done to the performances of the Next Generation crew. They get better in every movie and I grew up with this series watching it and they have given me more than most people I've met in my life. I'll miss the Next Generation crew -Mike",1053388800,2,1215,4.1308016877637135
1465450,4,B00005JLRT,"Ok here we go.  I just finished watching the film for the first time, and I can honestly say my draw jopped numerous times during my viewing.  I'll start with the special effects.  Great.  Next on the action, SUPERB!  The space battle at the end was absolutely breathtaking, and the characters seemed more ""human"" than your typical ""everything is dandy in the Trek universe"" that has been an element in TNG since the beginning.  The story, although sort of a [copy] of Star Trek II, is very well told with a menacing villain, tense situations, and some pretty wild action scenes (did I mention that already?).
This is a VERY different Trek than fans would expect.  But I knew it would be for two reasons.
1) The trailer - dark, mysterious, brooding...it hinted at something that had never been done before in Trek films.
2) The director, Stuart Baird.  If you are at all familiar with his work, you'll know his films are hardly light, and to be honest, if I were looking for a Trek director to continue the series, Baird would be low on my list.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing, as a revision was, in my opinion after seeing the film, what the franchise needed (box office take suggested otherwise, however).
The thing about this movie that really caught my attention was Picard's character seemed much different at the beginning.  Most Trek fans would label this as an atrocity, but I find it an interesting ""addition"" to Picard's personality not told in the series and films.  It makes him so less hardcore and we see the kid in him (interesting since this film is about his younger clone).
With that said, don't expect anything.  Go rent the movie and see for yourself.  But see it with an open mind, and no preconceptions.  Love the characters, but don't insist you know everything about them and are an expert in what they would or should do.  I, more than once, cheered out loud...that doesn't happen very often.",1053388800,,1926,4.623529411764705
1465451,1,B00005JLRT,"Once again this film (as does the DVD itself) has to be all about Brent Spiner.
Oh how I loathe his hammy acting and he just ruins this film. He co-wrote the script which pretty much gave him free reign to shut out other characters (Crusher, Riker, Geordi, even Worf!) while he, himself, got to play 2 roles! Data and B4! UNBELIEVABLE!
I purchased the DVD earlier today and was shocked to find that the entire packaging is centered around...you guessed it, Brent!
He appears on the front, the back, the side sleeve, the paper insert and even the disc! It would have been nice to have seen Picard alone, bit no..every picture of him either has Brent beside him or looking over his shoulder.
This last film by the TNG cast tanked at the box office. Maybe most fans, like myself, just got sick of the filsm always being about Data. Nothing kills a fun time better than an ego.
To save this film from a completly abysmal rating, I do give a major plus to Tom Hardy as Shinzon. That boy is talented & I would much rather have preferred screen time going to his character development rather than watching the horribly untalented Brent Spiner sing at Troi's wedding.",1053388800,5,1159,4.497630331753554

bad points in one of the most popular franchises in American and
World history the tenth film in the film saga and the fourth for
the next genration crew it either upset fans that were looking on
a great film because of the even luck in the series, or was liked
by fans , either way mixed opinons were for this film that takes
place in the begining of the film on Romulas the romluan empire
suffers an assasination of one of it's members of the councel of
Romluan ambassadors , meanwhile our next generation crew is at
reception for Commander Riker(Jonathan Frakes) and Concelor Troy
(Marina Sertas) who Troy was fomally involved with Worf(Micheal
Dorn)wich unfortunately the movie dosen't play on the rivalry in
Worf and Riker.
  When the crew arrives back on the ship they detect a variation
that is the same frequency that Data is putting out confronting
enimey and a long buggy chase scene they uncover what looks to be
a clone of data who is much more primitive that calls himself B4
wich Brent Spiner does what he does best in playing charachter
roles he get's to play two parts to his role in the film as the
crew resarches this further they have been told by Romulans that
a renegade ship is in the area of the darkside of Romulas known
as the Scimitar a hulking battleship that is ages old.
  Ivited by a mysterious figure named Shinzon who is played
brillantly and charming and evil by Tom Hardy by his vice roy
Remar played by unrecoknizable Ron Pearlman Picard leads an
away team aboard the ship , only to find that in Picards
curiousity Shinzon feels and knows everything that Picard does
this fuels a battle between them of wit and proweress to find
out anything that Shinzon knows about Picard  but while Picard
curiosity is holding him back to figuring out the real truth
that Shinzon only has very little time to live and he needs
B4 to deliver the plans that will make his huge Scimitar ship
into a huge radiation superconductor , no doubt also there is
a huge epic battle scene between the Scimatar and the Enterprise
E that is nothing short of awsome and and a sad ending that
fans of the next generation will not soon forget but the ending
ruiens the endind by being predictable for the only reason but
to make another sequel , Stuiart Baird is directing this film
but does not really take the fans and the film seriouly or to
hart wich made what could have been an excellent film into a
flawed film by showing not enough charachter development and
focusing to much on one charchter Picard(Patrick Stewart),and
no doubt he is one the best british actors but one charchter
is not enough to carry a Star Trek film this is a crew were
talking about here besides the fact that maybe a little more
between Picard and Shinzon would have made a diffrence in the
film to make the battle scenes more anticipated because what
an emimey Tom Hardy makes Shinzon into almost a tragic figure
from one of Shakespear's plays, the result in my opinon makes
this far better then the previous installment Insurrection and
not even close to being better then in my opinon and most fans
will agree with me First Contact wich was by far the best film
of the next generation crew.
  4 viginette's about the making of the film and deleted
scenes makes this better them some of the bare bones Star
Trek films other then first four two disk versions of the
first four Star Trek films. If nothing else if you have 9
of the previous Star Trek films there is no exscuse why
you shouldn't get Nemisis on DVD, even if you don't have
the 9 films and have seen the next generation televison
episodes it is a worth addition to your DVD library but

either Star Trek 2 , or Star Trek 4.",1053388800,,3853,4.425952045133991
1465453,5,B00005JLRT,"There has been a feeling among fans of Star Trek movies that the even-numbered movies have been much better than the odd-numbered ones.  While all of them have been fun to watch, this theory had been more or less true until the 9th movie, ""Star Trek: Insurrection"", which broke the theory with a great movie.  ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" makes it 2 in a row.
""Nemesis"" comes after a 4 year drought in movies, but the wait was certainly worth it after watching it.  The movie gives Star Trek fans something they've wanted to see for a long time in Will Riker finally marrying Deanna Troi - a relationship that was re-kindled in ""Insurrection"".  The movie also gives fans a glimpse into the Romulan Empire, (especially the planet Remus, first mentioned in the original series) something that has not been explored as deeply as the Borg or Klingons.  The DVD version will be a bigger treat for the fans, as it includes many scenes (including all of actor's Steven Culp) that ended up on the cutting room floor prior to release.  These scenes add to the overall dimension of the story, which may have blunted some criticism of the movie, had they been left in.
That is where the movie for fans ends & the movie for the rest of the public begins.  You don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy the action scenes as the Enterprise fights for survival.  But the real heart of this movie boils down to a simple question that any of us can ask ourselves:  What kind of person would we be today, if we lived & grew up under completely different circumstances?  Would we act the same, think the same? Is each person born with a pre-determined destiny, that no matter what, they will turn out a certain way?  Or is it simply that each of us starts out like a lump of clay and is molded by the environment in which we are raised in??
The original Star Trek was popular because of its ability to be very thought-provoking, yet entertaining us at the same time.  ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" follows that same tradition, beautifully!!",1053302400,,2007,4.483516483516484

Tom Hardy was good as Shinzon though and the space battle was done very well as well B-4 Data's retarded brother played so well by Brent Spiner. If you have seen Black Hawk Down Tom Hardy played Specialist Lance Twombly the soldier who got caught mocking the commanding officer. Data's sacrifice was nearly as good as Spock's was in Star Trek 2 and he was alot like Spock. Will I buy this movie? Yes I will so I can add it to the rest of my Star Trek videos and DVD movies.

1465455,4,B00005JLRT,"After the abysmal Star Trek film ""Insurrection"", the producers of Star Trek decided to take several years off from making Trek films until they could put together one that would trully shine.  After seeing ""Nemesis"", I would say they used the time wisely.  Star Trek Nemesis has an action packed, fast paced plot, that has everything that a good Trek film needs.
Many of the elements of this film are clearly inspired by aspects of past Trek films.  For example, having a single lead foe, a heavy, for Captain Picard to square off against, is very reminiscent of Kirk's face off with Kahn in Star Trek 2, and is plotted almost as well.  This face off between foes also has a unique twist involving Picard's unusual connection with his enemy.  The fact that one of the Trek crewmembers sacrifices himself in the film obviously also reminds one of Star Trek 2 and Spock's death in that film.  Bringing in the Romulans into the picture was an excellent move, as they are a major villain of Trek who has been around even longer than the Klingons (first appearing in the early Season One episode of the original Trek, entitled ""Balance of Terror"").  There are also parallels to Star Trek 6 in this decision, having the Enterprise sent to open a new diplomatic dialogue with an old enemy, only to be sucked into a crisis that threatens galactic peace.
The actors turn in excellent performances for the most part, and the main characters are plotted very well in this adventure.  I liked the fact that we had the customary Data quest for humanity stuff put in the film, but you don't get hit over the head with it as much in this picture.  Riker gets to play both romantic lead with Troi, and action hero when he takes on Remans who have boarded the Enterprise.  Picard is also given much more of an action role in this film, very reminiscent of how he was written in Star Trek First Contact.
The action sequences in this film are some of the best of any of the Trek films.  Nemesis has perhaps the longest ship on ship battle every put into a Trek film, and its one that will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense.  The special effects are superb, and the visual imagery of the battle is spectacular.
Star Trek Nemesis definitely shows that there is still life in the Trek film franchise, while at the same time providing an excellent last hurrah for the Next Generation cast.  Plotting the next Trek film may be difficult (mainly because they have to decide which Trek crew they will have in the film), but this film shows that they can do it effectively given the correct mixture of story elements and proper planning.  With Nemesis on the big screen, and the continued excellence shown by Enterprise on the TV screen, Star Trek continues to provide excellent science fiction entertainment.",1053129600,,2794,4.5843373493975905
1465526,2,B00005JLRT,"Would have give 2 1/2 stars if offered.  The story started off with a coup from the Remans, the race that has only been ever so briefly mentioned of in the Star Trek universe.  I found it a very unlikley plot to have a human of any type...even Picards clone to take over the Romulan Empire. The Romulan Star Empire was never written in Star Trek to be this weak.  They had a wonderful underground story established in the TNG series with Spock helping out that a civil war would have made more sense. Spock woulldn't had to even be in this series. Perhaps just some references of his work.
I was also very dissapointed at how little a on screen time that Beverly Crusher, Riker, and Worf and Troi had.  First Contact clearly proved that quality time could be allocated if a good
producer/director were running thinngs.
The film was riddled with inconsistencies.  How B4 come about is weak at very best.  Wesley's appearance in a Starfleet unform is ridiculous if you knew under the terms he left (he nearly started a war with the cardassians and left with the traveler and basically told Picard to stuff it). Picard did have hair in his youth. There are several more but I have said enough.  Add it to your collection to complete your set, but a good rental will cover it.",1053129600,3,1272,4.48051948051948

Just as Enterprise is slowly going down the tubes along with every other Sci-Fi TV show out there this film was not well recieved.  However despite that problem the movie is actually pretty good and is a good way to end the NExt Generation Saga.
The story here is that Riker and Troy have finally gotten married.  Before they leave on their honeymoon (and Riker to his new Ship) the Enterprise makes a detuer to a planet with a strange anomally.  After a brief exploration (in a Jeep like vehicle) they discover another Android similar to Data.  They take it aboard and it ends up being a Proto-type.  Meanwhile a group of rebeliouse ROmulans are planning an attack on Earth lead by a clone of Picard.  What then ensues is that they battle to the death with a sacrafice that not even I saw coming.
Overall this movie is for fans of the NExt Generation who have stuck with it through all these years.  This is the final film and it did end with some style.",1053129600,,1039,4.347150259067358
1465528,3,B00005JLRT,"I'm much more of a fan of the original crew than I ever was of the Next Generation, whom I've always felt were a little bland. I don't know if this is the last Generation movie or not -if it is, they certainly couldn't have done a more haphazard job of tying things up.  Troi and Riker's wedding comes out of left field (wasn't there a hint at something between her and Worf developing at one time?), poor Wesley looks like he was George Lucased into the wedding party, and isn't Worf a diplomat at this point and no longer a part of the Enterprise crew?  The Data plot is undercut by the existence of B-4.  Sure it was sad, but the drama is lessened because you know he'll be back in a sequel - in short, we've seen this already, in the far superior Star Trek II.
The one standout in this movie is Shinzon.  Hardy has got to be the most charismatic actor to appear as a villain in a Trek film since the sorely underused Malcom McDowell in Generations, and is nearly on par with the incomparable Ricardo Montalban as Khan.  He dominates every scene he appears in, even giving Patrick Stewart (who has always been the most honed actor on TNG) a run for his money.  The anti-chemistry between them crackles.  Despite his twerpish frame, something in Shinzon's scarred face and smoldering eyes sets him apart as very very dangerous.  His costume design is perfect as well - garbed in satantic black armor, he is every bit the Modred to Stewart's Arthur (note the climactic ... struggle -clearly a nod to Le Morte D'Arthur, but again, those Hollywood producers are too cowardly to let Picard [pass away]).
The space battle is great (and I really like the `telepathic sonar' concept with Troi - why didn't they ever have her do that before - it was really cool!), but FX are never enough to carry a film.  This movie is worth seeing mainly for Tom Hardy as Shinzon.  He plays the role with a ferocious intensity and underplayed criminal charm that is just riveting.  The man is a fantastically talented actor, and I hope to see more of him.

After the TV show TNG ended, Star Trek has been a monotonous and ridiculous franchise that is desperately trying to hang on.  The culmination of this is the ninth film, Star Trek Insurrection which was so bland and uninteresting I can't believe they didn't send it straight to video!  But wait, here comes director Stuart Baird, who has single-handedly breathed life into a dying series.
Star Trek Nemesis has everything you could want in a sci-fi film.  A cool-looking dune-buggy chase scene, an evil and interesting antagonist, awesome special effects, real characters and one of the best plots in the Star Trek series.  The look of the film is dark...just dark enough for the plot.  The cinematography...especially in the desert scene...is different from anything Star Trek has seen, but it's exactly what it needed.  The only thing that's out-of-place is where Data's clone came from, which ignores the possibility of Lore's return, but the rest of the film makes up for that (after all, they ignored the storyline of the Borg being individuals when they made First Contact).
All in all, this film is great!  For every sci-fi fan!",1052784000,,1197,4.95
1465530,5,B00005JLRT,"This latest installment in the Star Trek world is spectacular.  I saw it in the theatre.  It is one of the few films that:
A) Made my palms sweat
B) Occupied my mind for hours afterwards.
The writers and director were not afraid to go farther this time.  They weren't afraid to go 'dark', both in story and in moody dark lighting.  The villian actually seemed evil, as opposed to the utterly predictable villians in most films, including sci-fi.
The demise of a prominent crewmember was done tastefully, he died honorably in the service of his fellow comrades.  Touching.
There are punchy humor scenes, dramatic tension scenes, and hair-raising split-second actions that all add to heighten the experience of watching this film.  It is very good.
All films have things that can be picked at, but this one has fewer than most.  If you like Star Trek, buy this.  If you are not a Star Trek fan, you will probably still like this film as a movie all by itself.  My non-Trek friends did.",1052784000,,983,4.603448275862069

This film is probably my favorite Star Trek movie of all.  I, myself, am a die-hard ST:TNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation) fan and I believe this movie was a fitting end to a trully moving show.  Next Gen ran seven full seasons, but wasn't done there.  They went on to participate in many Star Trek films (Generations, First Contact, Nemesis...etc.).  This movie marked the end of the Next Gen journey.
With all the horrible things being thrown around right now such as the new TV show Enterprise (which, by the way contradicts almost every aspect of Star Trek, never mind the ship and crew never existed) it is good to have a wonderfull film such as this one come out and give Trekies a good show.
<<<If you haven't seen the movie skip this paragraph!>>>
To those who object to the loss of a certain crew member and only mention it to ruin the movie for readers, let me comment that you have totally missed the whole message of the action that the character's voyage towards humanity has finally reached its mark.  And if you are stupid enough to think he's dead you obviously didn't understand the importance of the last 2 minutes of the movie and the fact that B-4 is singigng the same song Data sang  at the beginning of the movie!
I say again, this is probably the BEST Star Trek movie ever made and it will live on as the best for a long time.  But to understand the movie and its powerfull message you must open up and see every aspect of it instead of closing yourself off the the actions.

The bad; and it's a whopper... Stuart Baird should be making commercials, not feature films.  Given his poor track record (""Air Force One"" and ""U.S. Marshalls"" are tedious films) Baird seems to have only read the script when he needed to shoot a scene, disregarding the story.  Bairds use (or lack thereof) of the marvelous sets and lighting provided by the ol' TNG group is nothing short of appalling.

1465534,4,B00005JLRT,"This film is not nearly as bad as people say. Yes, there may some small problems here and there, but let's try not to nitpick the movie like obsessed nerds. It has its problems, but it also has many high points--if only the script didn't betray them with unoriginality.
There is much to like about this picture, particularly in the realm of character development. There is a real sense that the crew is getting older and moving in, present in the marriage of Riker and Troi and Riker's promotion to captain--such developments add some much needed heart and soul to the franchise (though more were still needed--Picard and Crusher?). The production design and effects are top notch, and the battle scenes feature some of most inventive use of starship action in any Trek film (yes, it's true). Shinzon makes a good villain for Picard, and we even get a Guinan cameo for good measure.
The real problem with the film is that writer John Logan seems more content to blatantly copy ""The Wrath of Khan"" instead of crafting a new adventure. The Romulan angle is great, but instead of something new and different (possibly featuring Spock of Sela) we get a rehashed ""Khan"" complete with a personal, indistructable nemesis and the self-sacrifice of a beloved crew member. What's on screen is well done, but there's a sense that we've done it all before (a common Trek-ailment these days). And that, ultimately, is the final word on Nemsis--its an enjoyable movie, but afterward you just can't shake the sense that they missed some real opportunities here, and the movie suffers greatly as a result.
Still, its an enjoyable film, and to suggest its one of the worst Star Trek movies of all time is ludicrous. Trek is not dead, but it will be as long as those in charge keep trying to relive past glories.",1052697600,,1794,4.7165605095541405
1465535,5,B00005JLRT,"A sci-fi masterpiece. I've always found the TV shows to be very limited. The computer system was awkward. They never really fully used the weapons of their ship. While TNG was never bad about it, Voyager and Enterprise have always been filled with errors. This film really isn't. The ship is gorgeous, the technology more realistic for the time period. The plot is quite good, better than Star Wars, in my opinion.
The battle scenes are wonderful. They go all out in this one.
I know that many people do dislike this movie, but if you really read their arguments against it you'll see that they're almost as weak as an episode of Enterprise. Most people complain about how Data dies, but people do die. Get over it. I won't even address all the other complaints I've heard of the movie because almost all of them are nothing but nonsensical ranting. If you do your research, almost everything about this film goes along with Star Trek canon. The Reman planted WAS meantioned in TOS. It WAS stated that there were several prototypes before Data and Lore.

Why didn't the Aliens ever make it to earth???  Same goes here.  Why didn't the Borg make it earth, ala the Wolf 357 tv episode???  Or, if Deep Space 9 was along the same time line, why didn't the Dominion make it to earth???  I know some people will say they did that in First Contact, but that's NOT the same thing, nor is it what First Contact was all about.  I just hope they get some new ideas and make better movies.

If you try to dissect this film too closely, glaring plot holes and plot devices will jump out at you. Why were those Scorpion-class attack fighters on Shinzon's Scimitar? Answer: to get Picard and Data off of the ship. Why not use them against the Enterprise? I would assume that any sane military commander would use all of his available resources to win... Not Shinzon. This is the sort of ""fanboy"" idiocy you get with a John Logan script.
For anyone who wants to know what Star Trek: The Next Generation was really all about, watch the TV episodes. The Next Generation was arguably the most cerebral Trek series ever, though a case can be made for Deep Space Nine and its metaphysical threads. The series never relied on action to carry its stories, and very rarely practiced sloppy storytelling. Instead of building on the events of each film to craft some sort of coherent and thought provoking ongoing series, the Next Generation films have been little more than one-shot TV episodes - with Nemesis barely beating out Insurrection for third best Next Generation film, First Contact and Generations are my personal favorites.
If you want to see Patrick Stewart play Captain Picard as an intelligent, charming and witty explorer/diplomat, watch the TV series. To see Picard the action hero, pop Nemesis into your trusty ol' DVD player. I can only hope that a true ending to this great TV series will eventually surface.

Entertaining movies that would keep you in your seat for however long the movie was.  What the hell happend?  The last two movies have been disappointing to say the least.  But I'm only going to complain about this one.  Odds are if you are on line looking at this movie to see when it comes out, you have already seen it, so I won't go into the plot.  My question to people who saw this movie, and all the other Trek films is, did it seem like they were stealing ideas from other Trek films?
For example the dramatic battle at the end, where the Enterprise is fighting a cloaked ship.  Did that remind anyone of Star Trek 6?  Or when Riker kicks the guy off of the bridge because the bad guy has a hold of Riker's foot(Star Trek 3).  If you say, I have had enough of you (also Star Trek 3) while he is kicking, it fits perfectly.  Now the big one.  Data dies to save the crew of the Enterprise from a horrible death.  That should remind people of SPOCK!  And then, it looks like he could come back, because B-4 (the mentally ill robot) sings Blue Skies (which is the song Data sang at the wedding of Troy and Riker) it seems very similar to Star Trek 2, because it leaves you with hope.  Mr. Berman if you read this, please do something orriginal next time.  Oh by the way, I saw it three times.",1051833600,7,1434,4.194139194139194
1465614,4,B00005JLRT,"The darker Treks are by far the most superior of Star Trek. When I look at these types of Trek I usually see what Trek should have been on TNG (on TV), Voyager, and Enterprise could have been and should be. These ""dark Treks"" are Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, parts of Star Trek Generations, Star Trek First Contact and the subject of this review Star Trek Nemesis. While Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is hands-down the best Star Trek television show, Nemesis is almost the best film and the reason is that the producers took steps to go beyond the normal realms of television and family values. Deep Space Nine dealt with necessary evils, war, and realistic relationships, which include loss, and all the relationships had balance (like Kira and Odo...we know what happened!!! Can't be said about Worf and Troi in TNG). First Contact gave us realistic violence and touching issues. In TNG or Voyager, we usually saw our main characters misplaced in the past or future (and DS9 too) but in First Contact we get that ""human"" feeling of being lost and being thrust in a future universe. Nemesis, if not for intense cutting, would have been perhaps the most realistic, dark, and fascinating of the Star Trek films. What we are left with is almost on par with VI and First Contact (while none of the films can touch DS9) and is great entertainment despite what Trek fans know is not released.
 When I look at the DVD I see that the special features contain deleted scenes but what is truly lacking here (and I can say this though the release isn't for 18 days) is a ""extended cut"" of sorts (like the LOTR packages) in which all the deleted scenes are added into the film. This would make Nemesis the strongest Trek film ever. Some of the scenes cut are Data and Picard drinking wine, Crusher dancing, and explanations to why Wesley Crusher is at the wedding.
 I will admit that a lot of Nemesis and TNG lore in general is lacking. Troi and Riker have had a lot of build up but there have been so many holes in their relationship that the wedding seems inconclusive and unsatisfying. I also feel that Nemesis should have taken a DS9 approach with its characters by letting some of them go. Worf and Troi I could live without. I think Worf ended perfectly in DS9 by becoming an ambassador...but wait! he's back in Starfleet uniform. Just another large hole in the TNG plotlines. Besides, he has become the Gimli of TNG by providing old jokes and repetitive humor. One of the best things about the last season of TNG was Riker and Worf became very good friends but that diminished quick. What about Riker's ship... `naw', said Berman, `lets not bother showing it. I'm sure we'll make millions!' Millions less my friend! I digress. Nemesis is the victim of its own producing. They managed to produce a solid two-hour film but a fantastic film lie in its extra footage room. Beverly Crusher has always been a consistent companion to Picard and Ms. Gates has great chemistry with Mr. Stewart. There is one beautiful scene that had a lot of potential but is quickly forgotten as further scenes take it over.
 The truly fascinating thing about Nemesis is its villain. Next to all the movie villains, V'ger, Khan, Kruge, the God-thing from V, Chang, Soran, Borg Queen, and Ru'afo, Shinzon is perhaps the greatest of them all, and I expect a lynching for this, especially from Khan fans. But truthfully, what makes Nemesis great is that Picard finally meets someone who is his match. Picard always looks confused and taken aback by Shinzon when with every other villain from Q to the Borg, he can remain calm and defeat them with swagger. Hardy's Shinzon is amazingly captivating and though may be physically weaker then half the Enterprise-crew, it is his Picard like thinking and cockiness (from Picard's Academy days) that make him so threatening. Hardy and Stewart are amazing to watch. They shine with speeches of humanity, good, and evil. Though Nemesis is extremely action-oriented, the talking between Shinzon and Picard is the most captivating. Hardy is a great final nemesis for Picard. It is only fitting that Picard's final battle is against himself (essentially). All the characters endings are fitting except maybe Data's and if you haven't seen the movie I won't blow it for you but let's just say that Data's ""brother"" B-4 is a script saver just in case another film comes up, though the chances of that are slight. Riker gets one last fight, Worf gets one last fight, Geordi gets a very limited but special moment with his best friend Data, and even Troi gets to do something. That leaves out Crusher but what did the writers give her to do lately anyways. I see Nemesis as a fitting end to TNG that could have been better but still good in its own right though there are many holes and misplaced things due to editing that make the Trek fan and a casual viewer wonder, 'I wonder if Nemesis has more to offer'. The DVD might release some of that extra stuff but just like the Gladiator DVD, the deleted scenes could have made the movie thirty times better (at least from word of mouth for Nemesis) but the films themselves manage to stay on solid ground without the help of their wordy cut-backs.",1051833600,8,5234,4.644012944983818

One thing that they could easily have played off of from the series was character of B4.  In the series episode titled ""Inheritance"", Data's mother did indeed hint that there were more androids like Data than just Lore.  But for a few words, this easily could have given more die-hard fans somthing of what they wanted; An obscure reference to the series.  I do disagree with some other critisims about Picard in the area of him becomming an action hero.  There were plenty of situations where Picard demonstrated his physical prowness in the series (rock climbing, bar fights, tactical training, and so on).  But I do agree on the point that the movie was too Picard centered.  To be fair, however, if the general story of the movie had been an episode in the series, I think it would have been remembered as one of the best episodes (along with Chain of Command, and All Good Things...).  I close by saying that I hope very much that this is not the final movie with this cast, as there are too many loose threads and unanswered questions.",1051574400,6,1172,4.464788732394366
1465723,2,B00005JLRT,"This film was an brilliant essay on the end of twentieth century science fiction, as it regurtitates old archetypes in (what it hopes is) a new way. Take the Remans, for example. What are they but Nosferatu wearing leather coats from the Matrix? By stealing from the roots of sci-fi (horror) and the style of new sci-fi (currently, leather) Rick Berman's crew proves that they're creatively bankrupt. And the clone of Jean-Luc Picard almost exists as if to brag, ""So clones and baldness are cool now?  Well we did it first!""  Poor Brent Spiner in his pancake makeup proves eloquently that a new coat of paint won't fix the basic problem--that Trek is dead--a point further proved when they uncover his new ""brother"" in the stripmined desert wasteland of action movies (another false refuge for ailing sci-fi). Science fiction is good when it's about character--just like any fiction. Heck...it was Star Trek that proved that the science doesn't have to be good for the story to be there (way back when Bones declared that the self-replicating tribbles were ""bisexual""). Trek had some great moments, like Data defending his free will in ""The Measure of a Man"" and that time the doctor told Jeri Ryan he had to check out her ""implants."" But the sad desire to milk what was once good reflects what's happening to all outmoded space-ship driven Sci-Fi, and makes Nemesis embarrassingly bad. When Jean-Luc Picard is fighting a younger version of himself...what are we to take it for? Good writing? How about a metaphor for a sickly genre fighting its own old age? If you want to see cool characters wearing leather outfits standing against a hazy green backdrop, forget Trek, or even Patrick Stewart's other burgeoning franchise...Save your money folks. Buying Nemesis is like taking the blue pill--and choking on it.",1051488000,2,1812,4.937704918032787
1465724,3,B00005JLRT,"Having followed the TNG cast since day 1, I think Star Trek fans will find Nemesis as a very satisfying ending to what was by all accounts a wonderful series.  That being said, I doubt non-Trek fans will find this installment of Trek very appealing.
Producer Rick Berman was in charge of all four TNG movies (Generations, First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis) and as a fan I would rank this movie somewhere in between First Contact and Generations, with Insurrection being the worst of the four.
Berman and the Star Trek franchise got the formula right with First Contact.  It offered a solid story line with spectacular action, character development on all ends of the spectrum and an enemy that even non-Trek fans could appreciate in the Borg.
With Nemesis, there is somewhat of an appeal similar to that in First Contact, but it falls slightly short.  The B4/Data development should have had more time in this movie and the Picard/Shinzon conflict never materialized in a particularly realistic fashion.  Still, Trek fans will appreciate the action sequences towards the beginning of this movie as well as the battle between starships towards the end.  Fans will also appreciate the chemistry between Riker and Troi as they take a big step in their life.
I walked out of this movie depressed about the ending and I won't say why but you'll understand when you see the movie.  Overall, I would recommend that Trek fans purchase the DVD for its value as an action flick and the fact that its loaded with tons of extras.  As for me, while I will buy the DVD and I'm really hoping they use the actions scenes from the movie and turn it into something even more fun, a Playstation 2 game.",1051488000,12,1689,4.705084745762712

1465726,3,B00005JLRT,"The 10th Star Trek movie finally came, and as an avid Trek fan I waited for the occasion.  OK, let me say what I felt.  The film is not as bad as I was afraid, showing some good special effects and interesting cameos like Brian Singer or Kate Mulgrew.  And there is an ending that is clearly intended to surprise us, but ... yes, that is exactly the problem.  The fate of one of the beloved crew doesn't have enough impact to move us.  I think everything could be different with another directo like Jonathan Frakes, who surely knows and respects the world of Star Trek.
The story is a decent one, if not perfect or original.  Shinzon (Tom Hardy), ""nemesis"" of Captain Picard, shows up before the starship Enterprise to threaten the mass destruction of the whole universe.  This time he seems more powerful (and human) than previous enemies like Borg, and before we know it, he can control the politics of the Romulans, one of the most strong groups of the space.  Along this main plot, there are some about the long-delayed marriage of Riker, and the android named B-4, another ""alter ego"" of DATA.
Let us not talk about the coherence about the story.  Yes, we don't know why Worf is here while we think we saw him at Deep Space Nine.  We are glad to have him as long as the total result of the film is good.  To be fair, the film gives more actions enhanced by recent CGIs, so the battle sequences are better than anything you ever saw before.  At least writer John Logan (""Gladiator"") is a fan of the series, and he inserts some good in-jokes concerning the series.  And he didn't forget to give some lines to say to Beverly Crusher, who had been always treated as if she isn't there.
But ... I didn't like the film very much.  Sorry, but fans, how can you forgive it when you see Wesley Crusher in the opening scene, but doens't have any line to say?  You will miss him if you blink, and the scene looks as if the editor thought he is not worth giving some time to reappear in the film.  Or, see how the film ends, like I said.  Yes, the impact should be much, much more.  But what you see is just a hurriedly done wrap-up of the confused situation.  I cannot disclose much, but I can say this; they should have seen the ""The Wrath of Khan"" again, and how to make a truely emotional conclusion of the film.  Alas, but in ""Nemesis"" he is just wasted.
The greatest problem is perhaps the film looks very indecisive about whether or not the series should go on.  Some say the 10th installment is the last while others deny it.  I don't know which is true, but the film tries to satisfy the both views, and as a result lacks the courage to push the story further than on TV.  Director Stuwart Baird, it is clear, is trying to meets the needs from fans and non-fans, but as a result, though it is not a bad one like the fifth Trek film, it lacks the momentum to reach the best, namely ""Khan.""",1051228800,3,2891,4.283609576427256

Not a bad effort at all for the first time Director, Stuard Baird.  A movie that asked the question, what if the worst enemy is none other than yourself.  Would you simply give in & tell yourself that there is nothing that you do would make any difference or you push yourself to be a better person?  That's the question Jean-Luc Picard sought & the answer he found.  Bravery, loyalty, paternity, sacrifice for the common good, family are brought into light.  A definite vintage Star Trek.

1465729,3,B00005JLRT,"The Star Trek franchise (at around 10 movies and 5 series) is like farmland. It once produced bountiful and rich scripts, but has been so over harvested that story lines are increasingly stunted. Indeed, Star Trek Nemesis seems more like a rehash of the Wrath of Khan film, with additional plot elements from the TV series mixed in.
Without revealing too much of the movie, this film has a Federation's archrival suffering a crisis stemming from a mining planet (sound familiar?). A duplicate of Data comes into being and is subsequently used against the crew. From that point on, there are secret crew clones, mind melds, ship versus ship battles, the clumsily staged ""death"" of a major character who sacrifices their life to save the Enterprise, and so forth. All of these plot elements have been taken from earlier films or TV shows, reworked and repackaged.
Nemesis is clearly an attempt to replicate the successful Wrath of Khan movie. Unfortunately, the franchise has so focused on science fiction rather than traditional story elements, that the character identification and sentimentality that made up the original series, is absent for casual viewers. When the original Enterprise was blow-up in an earlier film or Spock died, the sense of loss that the director was trying to project, seemed tangible. Now, with a shiny new ship for each film or a multitude of duplicate crewmembers, it all seems contrived.
From an action standpoint, Nemesis is better than previous two or three films and is entertaining to watch. Nevertheless, this movie is a shadow of what the franchise once was. Perhaps if the producers let this series lay fallow for several years, it may bear fruit again.",1051056000,3,1690,4.99645390070922
1465730,5,B00005JLRT,"It's hard to determine just which one was better, Nemesis or First Contact. This can easily been one of the two best Star Trek Films of all time. Keep them coming Paramount.",1051056000,2,173,4.4375
1465731,3,B00005JLRT,"The problem with a franchise like Star Trek is that it has a very committed and opinionated fan base, and so these fans will tend to be overly-critical and aggressive about their feelings regarding anything new in the franchise. Star Trek has the benefit of being based in a very broad and immersive universe that is made up of a dynamic and diverse cast of characters. This is both a blessing and a curse: a blessing because in each new motion picture installment there is a lot to build from; a curse because it can be difficult to stay true to the characters and the spirit behind the universe.
When making a film from the Next Generation television series, one would be confronted with two problems: the first being that the series was at times uneven and muddled; the second being that there is a different expectation in a film than in a television show. That being said, it is the characters that made the series great, and the thing that made First Contact (Trek film #8) such a resounding success is that even though it had action, it was primarily character-based and the plot had all the things that make Trek fans salivate: time travel, tough decisions and a great villain(s). I mean, really, does it get better than the Borg?
My girlfriend (who is a die-hard fan) and I went to see this with high hopes, and left with mixed feelings. Overall, it was a pretty decent film. It was well-paced and the action was decent. The starship battle at the end was as good as the one in Wrath of Kahn (the best of the Trek films), and the special effects were top notch. Plus, to her delight, we got to see Riker and Troi get married.
However, there were some acute problems, the most glaring being the overuse of Captain Picard. The director, Stuart Baird, does not treat this like the ensemble cast-driven film that it should be. Furthermore, the carefree and loose attitude that Picard seems to have developed (a dune-buggy?) is not consistent with the character that the fans grew to know and love over the television series' seven years on the air. This isn't helped by the fact that his storyline feels contrived. The motivation that the Romulans have for building a Picard-clone (his ""nemesis"" in the film) is flimsy and almost laughable (kind of like America's own Missile Defense Shield). Furthermore, I felt cheated by the back-story of the planet Remus (they must really dig on Roman mythology).
Data's storyline is old-hat, and is merely a satellite to Picard's - and everyone else is just a peripheral. I found myself wishing that Picard would just die, just so we could see some more of the other characters. The wedding scene was ok, but too short. The romantic relationship that Troi and Warf began to develop in the series goes unmentioned (again!), and a chance for some great dramatic tension between him and Riker was completely missed.
Nitpicking aside however, it was a decent film and clearly better than the pile of you-know-what that was Star Trek V (as one reviewer asserted) or than its muddled predecessor, Insurrection. It was entertaining, and the plot holes, even if annoying, were forgivable. The drama on Romulus was interesting, and Shinzon's ship (can't remember the name) was threatening and scary. Despite my complaints about Picard, Patrick Stewart is still a great actor and the tension that develops between him and Shinzon is engrossing (could you kill a clone of yourself?). There are some great philosophical quandaries that are raised, even if they aren't explored much, and it was suspenseful. It was Trek film that was made with its eye on the passing fan and the general public rather than the die-hard fan - which brings me back to the point that I raised earlier about the expectations for making a film being different than for a television series. In order for a studio to green-light a big-budget film like this one, it has to have broad appeal. If the film were to depend too much on obscure references and be ensemble-cast centered, it would not be nearly as appealing to Johnny Public - even if it would make a better film.
What I would ask for is a longer cut: I would watch 2  hours of this film if it meant that I could see more of everyone else (not another dune-buggy chase). The rumored deleted scenes sound as if they would make a killer director's cut. In future Trek films I would ask for more Brent Spiner (he is a great actor, probably the best in the bunch), for Geordi to get his cool visor back, for Picard to be treated like the Captain of a crew rather than an action star, and lastly, for a plot that involves more of the rich Trek universe, thank you.",1051056000,52,4624,4.625304136253042

1465808,1,B00005JLRT,"IMHO, the Star Trek Franchise ran out of steam sometime around 1996. Voyager was lame, the TNG movies--which had some promise with ""First Contact""--fizzled out.
How could Science Fiction become so boring? This movie is like a checklist. Evil brother of an existing character that's never been seen before? Got it. A voice from the past threatens the future, done. Big space battle, check. Lots of special effects, got it. Evil looking BDSM-wearing bad guys who want to destroy Earth for some reason, check.
Watching this movie, you get the feeling that the actors feel the same way. As soon as one of them is about to do something different or intersting, the film cuts away. No wonder they all look bored.
With the focus on following the formula, you would think that they would at least try for some consistency. At the end of DS9, Worf became ambassador to Klingon but here he's back at his old post as security officer on board Enterprise. Wesley left starfleet to go with the Traveller, but here he is in Starfleet uniform. I guess we're supposed to pretend that the TV show never existed, which might be one way to make this movie watchable I suppose.
Watching this movie, you have to believe that Berman--or whoever's in charge--has no clue. Pick up any anthology of ten Sci-Fi stories and you'll find ten ideas more original than any of the ST:TNG pictures, doing a massive disservice to fans. (""First Contact"", the only watchable picture in the TNG series, relies on that boring old chestnut ""time travel"").
It is time to either reinvent the franchise (and ""Enterprise"" ain't gonna do it) or put it to bed. The well has been dry for quite some time now.",1050969600,20,1662,4.695205479452055
1465809,3,B00005JLRT,"I am at a quandry in this review.  This film is certainly better than some of its predecessors, but weaker by far than the best.  Basically, it amounts to an average Trek movie, and hence, I would rate it at 2 and a half stars if halves were allowed.
The film had its moments in purpose and in action, but spent far too much time and effort dwelling upon setting up for the climax.  Much too ""talky"" as the movie continues to reiterate the same points over and over again.  For instance, there is a scene where the villanous Shinzon makes a surprise visit to the Enterprise with an offer/request to Picard.  While the visual of Shinzon walking through the captain's desk was striking, his speech and Picard's response was precisely the same as was presented mere minutes before.  No new ground was explored in either the relationship nor in the conflicting situation.  Shinzon's presence left the chambers with still no resolution nor any progress toward the plot, making this scene one of those questions about why it wasn't edited out of the final cut.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk ... with nowhere to go.
Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Is it worth owning it on tape or dvd?  Ehhhh ... only if you are truly a fan.",1050883200,,1213,4.518348623853211
1465810,4,B00005JLRT,"I want to say something right off the get go, Nemesis was a great Star Trek story, one the Great Bird would have liked,  however, to people who aren't fimilar to the Star Trek way of thinking, this movie would seem slow and drawn out.  Star Trek TNG has all along dealt with humanity and ethics, this is no exception.  Patrick Stewart(Picard) and Tom Hardy(Shinzon) do a great job of playing the good versus evil and it truly relates to the series. Nature vs Nurture, a true debate in todays time, a scared Picard clone growing up in the worst possible conditions versus the great Captian Picard. I didn't like the character death but they did leave an out if they should prefer to make another movie.  Something had to deal with some Empire other that Borg or Klingon. And I am glad that they brought the Romulans into the mix finally and they way they did was brillant.  Not a bad story for a mailed scrpit from an amatuer.  A true Trek movie start to finish.
P.S. we have waited for 15 years for Troi and Riker to hook up, its about time!",1050796800,,1041,4.34020618556701
1465811,2,B00005JLRT,"Folks, ""Nemesis"" is little more than a remake of ""The Wrath of Khan.""  Think about it.  A villain from the past (sort of), a weapon of mass destruction, a climactic space battle, and the death (sort of) of a beloved character while saving the Enterprise.
Why does Paramount continue to do these movies on the cheap?  Yes, the special effects are spectacular, but the makers continue to compartmentalize Trek movies.  They do it so they don't have to spend a lot of money on sets.  You have the ship, and then you have the various wastelands/wilderness ""sets"".  Don't believe me?  Nemesis:  wasteland dune buggy chase.  The Final Frontier:  wasteland ""Paradise"" outpost and El Capitan climb.  The Search for Spock:  wasteland planet destroying itself.  Generations:  desert planet for Soran's launch site.  First Contact:  wilderness missile launch site.  ENOUGH!!!
Just about everything else in the movies is aboard ship.  Mind you, I don't object to that, per se, but why can't they spend some money on some futuristic sets and try to make at least one epic Star Trek film???
As for the movie, Shinzon is adequate as a villain, but I certainly don't believe he would have it in him to wipe out the entire Romulan Senate.  Sorry, that's just too farfetched.  The wedding and B-4 plot diversions are enjoyable, but that's all they are--minor diversions.  The special effects are fabulous, but they should have thought about developing a story that looks beyond CGI.
It's not hard to see why this movie was a box-office disappointment.  It also apparently was a disappointment to a great many fans considering some of the reviews here.
Overall, a poor way to end a legendary series of movies.  They should have made a movie to remember rather than one to forget--this movie was as weak as the first one.",1050192000,11,1801,4.8519736842105265

It's not just because the script relies on cliched sci-fi plot elements without contributing anything fresh.  It's not just that the script is dull, illogical, and poorly paced.  It's not just that every actor seems bored with her or his amateurish dialogue.  It's not just the lame close-ups of hands and faces, the poor lighting, terrible score, the cheap sets and corny special effects.  And it's not just that they needlessly kill the best character unceremoniously.  It's that this isn't Star Trek.  The science is bad (Trek used to pride itself on its accuracy), it is untrue to character types, it doesn't follow the established Trek rules for technology (holograms can be generated anywhere at random, it seems), and, perhaps worst of all, it has the main characters break the Prime Directive, the number one rule of Star Trek, without thinking twice, all for the sake of an unexciting, traditional shoot-'em-up chase sequence with no purpose in the overarching plot.  Thankfully, this should be the last TNG movie, ending a great TV series and a very poor movie franchise (save First Contact).",1049846400,13,1276,4.985849056603773
1465815,4,B00005JLRT,"...is that they have to sell. Yes, that's right. While for the TV shows the producers have the liberty to play with really wonderful SF ideas (like the episode where Dr. Crusher gets trapped inside her own universe, or like ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and there are so many more) and truly explore new worlds -- in terms of imagination at least, when they make the movies for the big screen, they have to compromise in order to satisfy the tastes of a broader audience, and that's how you get fist fights, Picard with a gun, chases through places with pipes etc, Data singing... True, all these are elements that were seen occasionally even in the TV series, but not all together at once, in an obvious attempt to make the movie SF, action-movie, occasionally funny all at once. Oh yes, and the ugly aliens. Why do they always have to be so repulsive??? The Romulans were always OK (our luck that we already knew them from TV and they couldn't change them), but the Remans just had to be as ugly as they can get. It's not believable, either... just think that the viceroy had nails so long that he couldn't press the buttons right. For me, these elements ruined the movie in parts. Also, some inconsistencies: what was Wesley doing at the wedding in a Starfleet uniform when we know clearly that he has left Starfleet years before with the Traveller?
Well, all these being said, you may wonder why it gets 4 stars. First of all, it's still Star Trek -- and definitely better than Insurrection. Then, if you leave aside the above, the movie does have its good parts. The Shinzon/Picard conflict is good -- even if it deals with cloning, but then, doesn't everything these days? -- and I loved the space battle. Thumbs up for ST on this one -- I was so dissapointed in SW II, where they had so much money but not a single space battle was shot... Also, the emotional development is good... except that I didn't quite sympathize with B4, he was never sufficiently developed.
And there was an aspect which reminded me of ST VI: there, in the end, they make peace with the Klingonians... here, in the end, they make peace with the Romulans. Feels like a nice closure. And a new beggining.",1049673600,11,2180,4.535532994923858

Stuart Baird's direction makes this one a tautly-paced, exciting adventure with fantastic special effects and a great score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. Both Patrick Stewart as Picard and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker turn out great peformances, and the added gravitas fills the void left by previous Trek movies.

Brent Spiner's 'Data' was by far the best portrayal of Data ever.

Finally, a TNG movie allows some change--actually, quite a bit of change--in the lives and circumstances of our characters rather than returning them all to the kind of eternal stasis that is common to episodic television.  This is a quality that always made the classic Trek films feel like events--Kirk was promoted off his ship, Spock died, the Enterprise was destroyed, etc.  TNG films have always gotten that wrong, right from the first one, in which they were still flying around in the same ship and wearing the same uniforms from the TV series.  Now Berman and Co. seem to have finally clued in to that fact, but it feels like too little too late.
Final verdict: this is a passable but disappointing adventure.  Some good action is undermined by dark sets and a stagy feel to the proceeding.  And what's up with Worf?  He has been returned to duty aboard the Enterprise without explanation, although the finale of the Deep Space 9 series showed him becoming a liaison between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.

1465888,1,B00005JLRT,"This supposed ""final chapter"" of the TNG crew was nothing short of an abomination. It's obvious the cast just showed up for the paycheck, because the acting was tired, and most of the lines that were meant to make fans cheer and laugh were met in the theatre with groans and silence. To make matters worse, the whole film looked as if it was shot in a very dark room.

The villain Shinzon, instead of being a truly formidable foe, turned out to be a whiny, bald-headed brat in charge of a gaint killer starship. Why, after all this time, has ""Q"" never been the subject of a Star Trek film? He is almost as popular as the Borg and yet he's passed over for inclusion in a TNG movie time and time again!

It's a shame that the magnificent journey of the ""Next Generation"" crew had to be tarnished with garbage such as this. Apparently the film was slashed to pieces, judging by all the cut scenes available on the DVD, but sadly the film wouldn't have been any better had it been unabridged.

Why Rick Berman and the producers felt obligated to kill off one of the main characters is beyond me. The only reason I can think of is that the actor who played this character WANTED to be killed off, since in Star Trek, heroes ALWAYS figure technical ways out of every life-or-death dilemma. Maybe like the franchise, he felt worn out and tired of it all.

If you're a Trek fan, don't bother with this film, and pretend the whole thing never happened. Great casts should go out with a bottle of Dom Perignon, but sadly, this film can't even measure up to sour grape juice.",1047945600,18,1564,4.364261168384879
1465889,4,B00005JLRT,"One thing is certain in Star Trek that seems to have been forgotten - the chemistry of the cast and story. Nemesis was a failure at the box office and I'm scratching my head as to...why? The 10th installment brought back the chemistry of the cast and brought forth a story rivaling, although not succeeding, The Wrath of Khan. There's no Borg this time, no deadly Klingons, or any probe that wants to find whales. However, we have realism.
Commander Riker has just married Counselor Troi and has been promoted to Captain with his own ship, but before they can get to Troi's homeworld, a call comes in from the Romulan Empire. A lot of people thought with some news on the marriage that it would be this gigantic portion of the movie, albeit it is not and takes up only 3 minutes worth of screen time. Schinzon, a clone of Captain Picard, has eliminated the Romulan Senate and seeks peace with the Federation from the dark side of Remus. Of course, we can all gather that peace is the last thing on this guy's mind. What develops is a story reminiscent of The Wrath of Khan, yet very dark and twisted...what I mean by that is clearly, everything is not on the table at once and the gorgeous locations are...well, shot in an eerie light.
You'll find here some throwbacks, a Genesis-type device that actually is an entire ship, some Spockism's, and an ending fitting to the nautical nature of what Star Trek really has been, only sidelined in the past few movies. If you like drama mixed in with one of the best space battles I've seen in recent memory, you'll want to see this. I don't want to give away the spoilers, but the depth of the battles and twists of fate are worthy of high appreciation. This isn't like #9 where you could go the restroom and sit for 20 minutes and come back. It pins you to the seat. I would venture that if you miss, aside from the marriage, a few minutes, you'll need to catch-up with the person next to you or watch it again.
The characters have different roles this time. Riker is the outgoing First Officer and Data has been chosen to replace him. Although, during the movie, Riker is still Number One due to the situation. Worf plays a minuet role in this film very much like Uhura in ST: III and Dr. Crusher doesn't have the onscreen time she did in the previous 2 movies. There is an interesting appearance by Admiral Janeway of Voyager fame.
Ok, so now you may be wondering why I'm reviewing a DVD version of the movie. Simply, I caught a last run of this in a small theater and it's fair to say the movie has all but finished the theatrical run. Other than the deleted scenes and extra's they put in as fillers for a DVD, I have not seen a movie drastically changed from theatrical to video. My review is of the movie. The Motion Picture, Wrath of Khan, and Search for Spock have their additions, yet they're Director's Cuts. I hope you enjoy this movie when you get to see it, or see it again, because I was inclined to go in with an opinion not to like it. The reviews were horrible for it when it was released...and after seeing it, I cannot understand...why.

As to the DVD itself, I just read on startrek.com how the 45 minutes of footage of film that were cut for the theatrical release will be on the disc...as extras. With the exception of one set of scenes (an earlier introduction of Shinzon, which would have detracted from the impact of his first encounter with Picard), the scenes SHOULD have been edited back in for the DVD release. Especially a conversation between Picard and Data at the wedding about life, loss, choices and consequences, which would have made the conclusion considerably more powerful than it was.
Fiscally, the film was a failure. It performed horribly at the box office and will likely be the last Trek film, at least for a good long while. After Berman's mangling of the Trek universe, it's probably just as well.

So far all the movies have just been attempts at writing episodes and stretching them to film length. This has failed repeatedly, though 'Generations' was worth watching simply for Malcolm McDowell's Soran and 'First Contact' managed to captivate because it introduced a new bad guy (to the films, that is) and showed us Trek history.
Having said that, 'Nemesis' ranks second to last in the TNG film series (with 'Insurrection' easily ranking last) because of its truly unimaginative story. Sci-fi clones. Star Wars, anyone? New focus alien to the films. Didn't we do that with the Borg in 'First Contact', the Ba'ku in 'Insurrection'? I'm all in favor of doing more than just Klingon-oriented films, but don't base a whole movie simply on some under-represented alien race making an appearance. Yet another sibling to Data? All I can say is that Soong must've been a Catholic, if you know what I mean.
However, as much as I disliked the movie, I felt it would've been a very good science-fiction movie had it not been 'Star Trek.' I expect a certain level of quality when I go see something bearing that title. Unfortunately, 'Trek' seems to be in a bit of a slump. The TNG movies, 'Voyager', and now 'Enterprise'? Are we ever going to be rewarded with another 'Trek' experience worth our time? We've watched for so long, why must they continue to disappoint? If you liked this movie, I'm glad. This was just my take on the most recent outing from the TNG cast.
Being a hypocrite, you will find this DVD in my collection when released. Being a film student and a long-time 'Trek' fan, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I didn't own all the movies.",1047168000,8,1800,4.64576802507837
1465978,2,B00005JLRT,"Hey, I'm not a trekkie.  Let's get that on the table right away.  But I have seen the movies and some of the series, so I had high expectations for this film.  My biggest problem was that, in the end, I just didn't care about the villain.  This film had the opportunity to be a great one, but it didn't take enough chances.  For instance, if they had chosen to kill off one of the original series' scared cows, like Sulu or Uhura, suddenly I've got a vested interest in nailing Shinzon.  But in the end, a Villain set on destroying the earth is a bit old hat for 2003, and for that matter, given the ease with which one can slip in and out of time travel in the series, what does it really matter? :)
But seriously, I like the TNG crew, Patrick Stewart is a fine actor and I care about the rest as characters.  What this series needs is a director/writer combination that aren't afraid to take risks.  Re-invent the series a bit and come up with a quality journey that audiences will enjoy.  I want to like these movies, I really do, but First Contact is where it ended for me.
High marks on the special effects, and the sound was terrific.  Other than that, I just couldn't get excited.  We deserve better, and the cast deserves better scripts.  I fear that this may be the last of Star Trek for a while, given the poor box office performance and the television series lull.",1046995200,6,1375,4.2664092664092665

1465980,3,B00005JLRT,"I really hoped Berman and Co. would have learned from the previous mis-steps which littered the previous TNG films. It was not to be.
My trepidation began while reading an overview of the film and subsequent interview with Rick Berman. During the hype session, Mr. Berman purported that his writing team had come up with the Ultimate Villain (UV). I remember thinking, ""Gee, more ultimate than the Borg?"" I always thought ultimate meant the best of ... seems Berman really didn't mean it when he called the Borg the ""Ultimate Villain"" for Star Trek: First Contact. Why Paramount insists on creating a single entity antagonist is beyond me. I think this is Wrath of Khan-itis. With the exception of First Contact, none of the TNG films are distinguishable from each other. Ridiculous crazed villain, with insane idea runs across Picard and crew and is thwarted.
I'm not going to over-analyze or take pot shots here (okay, maybe I am), but the performances in this film were not terribly well executed. Even Patrick Stewart looks flat and over-facinated by the whole Shinzon issue. There wasn't this much rue in the First Contact movie. Further more, was this intended as a comedy? I can't remember the last time I heard so many startled guffaws (many of them my own) at a non-comedy billed film. The destroyed viewscreen and subsequent Starfleet crewmember being sucked out into space, anyone? You cannot tell me that you watch this sequence without laughing out loud. Any too many ridiculous action movie cliches; from Data's final act, to Riker's ""tense"" fight in the bowels of the ship ... it was too predicatable and not well executed. I couldn't help feeling this film has such a narrow and isolated scope, despite the nefarious aims of the UV.
Another gripe was with Shinzon's desire to destroy Earth. I couldn't get why this was so important. How this plan would make the universe better for Reman's was far beyond me. It reminded me of 1950's sci-fi where the evil menace just HAD to destroy the world just for the sake of doing so.
""Ultimately"", this film seemed just as contrived and shallow as Insurrection, which at least had better performances by the cast. There was absolutely nothing for the actors to do. They visit Romulus. Meet Shinzon. Picard gets warm and fuzzy with the UV. UV snaps, wants Picard's life essence. UV also wants to destroy Earth. Enterprise and crew chase down UV and his Ultimate Weapon. TNG crew prevail. That's it! Mildly entertaining stuff, but not even close as the best Trek adventure.
And before anyone feels that I'm an outsider looking in, this is not so. I can go toe-to-toe with anyone when it comes to Trek. I just prefer not to wear rose colored sunglasses.",1046649600,5,2706,4.796573875802998

Picard, who has spent a lifetime committed to the high ideals of the Federation, meets his clone - a clone who has spent his formative years in tortuous, merciless surroundings.  Wonderfully played by Tom Hardy, the clone despises the Federation and its ideals.  He also depises Picard for his weakness in following those ideals.  Picard's faith in himself is challanged, as he wonders if his principles and ideals would have survived the upbringing that his clone endured.

1466069,4,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis was a really good movie but it was nowhere near as good as the old-school Star Trek films. There was just not enough emotional closure in the film. This is billed as the ""Final"" trek film but we don't really see Picard truly say goodbye to his ""family"" on the Enterprise and we don't get the feeling that anyone cares that they will be split up. I would have liked to see Picard finally end up with Doctor Crusher and I would have liked a more sincere and heartfelt goodbye scene with Picard and Riker. Data's wake was also kind of emotionless and rushed and the crew didn't really seem to be that sad that he was gone. The continuity in the film was also poor. Worf became an Ambassador to the Klingon Empire in the end of Deep Space Nine but he somehow ended up as a Security officer on the Enterprise once again. There was no mention of his Klingon post at all. It was like we were just forced to pretend that Deep Space Nine was not part of the Trek Universe in that aspect. Wesley Crusher's appearance also affected the Trek continuity negatively because he left Starfleet in the final season of the series yet he was in a uniform at Riker's wedding. He was also given incredible superhuman powers that would make his appearance at a mortal wedding ceremony impossible. Tom Hardy, on the plus side, was excellent as Shinzon. He truly made the film worth watching. The scenes with Picard and Shinzon were great and I wish there were more of them. I hope the DVD fixes the timeline errors and I look forward to buying it. It's not a great Trek film but it is not the worst in the Trek series. It's nowhere near as bad as one and nine.

1466076,2,B00005JLRT,"In this 10th installment of the Star Trek franchise we are lucky enough to be graced by the presence of Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Levar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, and last but certainly not least the beautiful Deanna Troi now turned Deanna Troi Riker at the beginning of the film played by Marina Sirtis.  This film while attempting to cater to a general audience, is still a film about family.  The crew of the Enterprise has become family as well as part of our television heritage over the last 15 years.  So naturally the beginning of the film focuses on what's going on with the family, and also more importantly how they are beginning to part.  It has been 4 years since we last saw them in the anything but perfect ""Insurrection,"" the 3rd in the Next Gen series of the franchise.  This time we are not in the trusted hands of Jonathan Frakes who can take a script like ""Insurrection"" and make it watchable using technique and getting solid performances by his fellow cast mates.  This time we are in the hands of experienced action director Stuart Baird, who tries to generalize Star Trek and make it accessible to everyone forgetting the material is very limited in audience span to begin with.  Therefore, in the process delevers us some bologna on wheat direction as to where this film is going and the essence of what it is suppose to be...  A Star Trek picture.  This film does not work anyone hard and that is the generalization of it.  The cast's talents are not being displayed to their fullest, at least not their most important talents that would be crucial to the film.  Brent Spiner who plays one of my personal favorite characters Data, sings a dreaded song called ""Blue Skies.""  A song that I have a painful memory of, being an actor myself.  Through the rest of the film, he proves to be the bright and shining point playing Data the android who has reached the end of his quest for humanity in this film and now understands and behaves more like humans than ever before.  Data and B4 were in essence the same except for technological advances between them making Data more advanced.  I thought that the idea of making another android other than Lore from the TV series was a juvenile ... attempt at creating hope for a fifth film role reprisal from Spiner now 53, who is getting too old for the part.  Star Trek is truly ending and the signaling for the end was the beginning of ""Voyager"", the fourth television installment of the franchise.  We know longer get fed intelligent situations that involve ethical and moral dillemnas, we now get fed [a movie] that involves monsters that are computer rendered and sometimes makeup assisted, and CGI ships that look totally unconvincing as opposed to motion control that was used in the earlier days and was much more costly, we get these big behemoth looking enemy battle ships that look as threatening as my 9 year old little brother on a motorized horse ride.  Star Trek has boldly gone where no one has gone before...  In the past.

They hired the writer of ""Gladiator,"" the master of the multi-layered epic film and then filmed his long complicated script.  Then the studio insisted that they cut the movie down.  This left many plot threads dangling and questions unresolved.  I know from reading various articles there were more scenes developing B-4's character, explaining the political dealings on Romulus, expanding upon the mental violations of Troi, giving Worf some more to do, looking into Picard's psyche, and expanding the one-second cameos of Wesley and Guinian.  These scenes would have addressed many of the fan criticisms toward the movie and made the storyline feel more complete.  Why hire the ""Gladiator guy"" if you don't want an epic film.  Show the full thing.  Fans would much rather see a longer epic film than a short choppy one.  This is probably why there is not much repeat view.

The problem, for me, was the execution.
A machine gun fight with racing dune buggies?
A StarWarsEsqe corridor Blaster Battle?
A HuntForRedOctoberEsque metal catwalk chase scene?
This is not Star Trek, folks. This is a desperate studio hiring a ""non-Star Trek"" director to try and make this more ""accessible"" to non-fans. But you see, the non-fans don't go to see Star Trek. And the fans that went, well, didn't get to see it either.
The ending... like I said, I had no problem with the concept of the ending. But they didn't do it right. They didn't give any sense of completion, or reality.

1466122,4,B00005JLRT,"I went into this movie with expectations at floor level. 9 critics out of 10 had dissed the film to some extent, and the plot (from what I knew of it) didn't sound too promising. I was expecting to be disappointed. Pleasantly, I was in for a small treat. While most certainly not the best film in the Star Trek canon, ""Nemesis"" serves up some good dialogue, moody effectiveness, action, and philosophical angst.
The story starts within the Romulan senate, and the exterior view of the senate chamber, panning down from the sky above, looks like something straight of the Star Wars prequels. The senate is assassinated, and a new leader emerges. His name is Shinzon, and he proves to be the namesake of the film. Meanwhile, on Earth, Wil Riker and Deanna Troi are getting married. The nuptials are overseen by Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and many of the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" regulars and semi-regulars are in attendance. Soon, the crew is underway to Troi's home planet, so that they can stage a Betazoid version of the wedding. If you do not know who Romulans, Riker, Troi, Picard, or Betazoids are, then this movie isn't for you. The film does not explain it to you. This one's for the fans. Just letting you know.
Aboard the Enterprise, Picard and Co. hear a strange signal emanating from a planet, investigate, and find a duplicate of their android crew member, Data. News soon reaches the Federation that the new Romulan leader wishes to make peace with them, so the Enterprise is sent to extend an olive branch. Shock of all shocks, Shinzon is actually a human clone of Captain Picard, and is bent on making war, not peace (this is all given away in the previews). Shinzon also hates the Romulans, as they had exiled him in his youth to their sister planet, Remus, a cold, desolate place enshrouded in darkness. With a Reman band of desperados, Shinzon plans to destroy the Romulans and the Federation with his super warship and its massive, devastating new weapon. Picard and crew must, of course, stop him.
""Star Trek: Nemesis"" is, in many ways, a paler version of an earlier Star Trek movie, ""The Wrath of Khan"", a film considered by most Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike to be the best in the series. There is a villain with a personal vendetta against the protagonist (Khan vs. Kirk / Shinzon vs. Picard). There is an emphasis on great ship-to-ship space battles. Both films feature the climactic battle scenes inside conveniently-placed nebulas. And both films feature the death of one of the main characters. I must say that, like ""Wrath of Khan"", ""Nemesis"" delivered somewhat of an emotional wallop for me. The inclusion of old familiar characters such as Wesley Crusher, Guinan, and Admiral Janeway make for nice touches. There are nice ""talkie"" scenes, where the characters explore the undercurrents of what drives them, and what makes them unique. All in all, it works. This is purported to be the final film featuring the cast of ""The Next Generation"". If so, it is a fitting end.
You're going to have to overlook some things about ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", and just kind of 'go' with it. Yes, there are some plot points that don't make sense. Yes, the wedding scene is excruciatingly hammy. And, yes, Shinzon is rather reminiscent of Austin Powers' own nemesis, Dr. Evil. But perhaps it is because I grew up watching cheesy British sci-fi that I can sidestep some of these issues, and try to focus on the general story at hand. We are given some good food for thought regarding cloning (timely, to say the least), and the uniqueness that makes up who we are as individuals. There is also humor, camaraderie, and sacrifice.
""Star Trek: Nemesis"" is a dark film in many ways (set design, lighting, plotline), but it does feature one startling positive message: that we can change ourselves for the better. This sort of unequivocally bright outlook is what helped define the seven year run of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". I'm not sure what the future holds for humans, and our possible exploration of the stars, but this particular incarnation of ""Star Trek"" has always been the way that I would look to see it turn out.

Tom Hardy and Patrick Stewart did excellent job's portraying there characters. I wish the other members of the Enterprise had more involved roles and sub plots.

How inexcusable is it that after a four-year big screen hiatus that Trek returns with another exercise in mediocrity? Isn't it bad enough that the once-vibrant television franchise has been destroyed with an inferior spin-off (""Enterprise"")? With this tenth movie effort, long-time TNG fans were finally given another chance at an epic moviegoing experience. Instead, they got laughable dialogue, boring villains who existed only to generate space combat, a mind-numbing first hour, and a jeep chase, for God's sake. Are the writers/creators really that sophomoric? This is ""Star Trek,"" after all. Forgive me if you disagree, but a jeep chase hardly seems fit for inclusion in this once high-brow franchise.
Come to think of it, that's the entire problem with the current state of Trek. The writing used to be top-notch, the characters used to be provocative, and the voyages used to be inspiring. They ceased to be that in May of 2001 when ""Voyager"" ended. ""The Next Generation"" used to excite our imaginations every week with inventive and sophisticated plotlines, engaging characters and a great sense of adventure. Sadly, ""Nemesis"" had none of that. Our beloved characters were given laughable dialogue, everyone except Picard and Data were window-dressing, the villains were cliche, and the hackneyed plot was a tired retread of your average outdated action movie.
Speaking of action, some people give far too much credit to this movie simply on the basis of the space battle in the second half. Sure, phasers and photons are nice, but can they really make up for the first half of the movie? And try as you may, you'll never convince me that the first half was even mildly interesting. Considering that this movie was touted to be the final one featuring the TNG crew (and most likely will be due to its poor showing at the box office), I really can't imagine a more lackluster conclusion to a once-great legacy. For those of you who thought ""Generations"" and ""Insurrection"" were bad, here's another piece of average Hollywood tripe derived from a television series that was anything but average. But then again, all good things must come to an end...",1044230400,2,2258,5.040106951871658

Most movies we have liked, the artsy fartsy critics did not. If we have any complaint, it has too much Data and not enough of the others.",1043798400,7,307,4.368421052631579
1466246,5,B00005JLRT,"I feel disappointed by the poor performance of ""Star Trek Nemesis"" at the box office, and the fact that is going to do more poorly than ""Star Trek V-The Final Frontier"" makes me uneasy.  I even went to see the movie three times to see if I could help in its box office run.  You may think I'm crazy, but I couldn't help it because I found this film excellent.
The movie presents interesting events such as the marriage of Commander Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) -at last.  Then you have Patrick Stewart's remarkable performance as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who discovers that his nemesis is a clone of himself; Brent Spiner also shines as Lieutenant Commander Data, the best Trek character after Spock, who sacrifices himself at the end of the movie (but is he really...?  You know).  And there is Ron Perlman (of ""Beauty And The Beast"" fame) who always gives his best, no matter if he is wearing make up; only this time, he plays the viceroy for Picard's clone, Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  Let's not forget the fantastic music score by the great Jerry Goldsmith and the visual effects from Digital Domain.
But then again, it appears that not only do the average audience didn't go see this film, but also the fans appear to have lost interest.  But I still believe that ""Star Trek Nemesis"", as directed by Stuart Baird (""Executive Decision"", ""U.S. Marshals""), is one of the best movies in the franchise after ""Star Trek-The Motion Picture"", ""The Wrath Of Khan"", ""The Voyage Home"", and ""First Contact"".  As a fan, it's a shame to see the Trek films go down.  Honest.",1043452800,4,1600,4.685714285714286

Wrath of Kahn: Kirks Birthday
Nemesis: Wedding of Troi & Riker
2)We are soon made aware of a weapon capable of destroying an entire planet using illegal technology
Wrath of Kahn: Genesis Device & protomatter
Nemesis:  Remen terror weapon using the newest form of illegal technology

1466248,3,B00005JLRT,"STAR TREK X: NEMISIS is the supposed last of the Star Trek films in the 36-year history of Star Trek originally conceived by Gene Roddenberry (Andromeda, Earth: Final Conflict) back in 1964. Directed by Stuart Baird (Executive Decision, US Marshals) the film has a dark tone. This film is definitely more interesting than the last installment (Insurrection), but not quiet as good as First Contact. I think the tone of the film is what missed its mark for me. There was too much talking between Shinzon played by Tom Hardy (Band Of Brother, Black Hawk Down) and Captain Picard played by the always-brilliant Patrick Stewart (X-Men 2, A Christmas Carol) and exposition and not enough for the other characters to do.
The star for this film was Data, played by Brent Spinner (Out To Sea, The Master Of Disguise) playing a duel role as the ever-misfitted android and a duplicate brother called B4. The scenes of his light-hearted humor, curiosity, quick wit and heroism make this film very enjoyable. Problem because Brent was also one of the three who came up with the story idea as well with producer Rick Berman (Enterprise, Deep Space Nine, Voyager) and screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The Time Machine 2001, Any Given Sunday).
The story is simple  but a little weird. Captain Picard was cloned by the Romulans (the Bad Guys) in order to be replaced in the Federation an infiltrate the Good Guys. Due to a change of politics and governments  the plan was abandoned and the clone grew up under hardship to become the future destructor of planet Earth. Yawn.
Now the real action takes place more than halfway into the movie where the Enterprise rams Shinzons ship. From that point the forward the movie is a roller coaster. And, thanks to Data, who destroys the most deadly weapon known in the Universe  the Earth is saved. Data even has a moment where the audience cheered!
The supporting cast gets second seat in this film and even Jonathan Frakes (Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds) gets a decent fight scene in this, but not a great contributor to the plot overall. Mr. Frakes did a great job directing First Contact.
There are cute scenes, wedding reception scenes, love making scenes, there is even some off-roading too   but over-all it takes the last 40 minutes to get you involved. Also there is an emotional ending that may shock Star Trek fans  the two who didn't know anything about it.
The score is by the incredible Jerry Goldsmith (Logans Run, Explorers, Patton) and the special effects are top notch and completely believable. Overall Star Trek fans should be satisfied and the non-Trekker will enjoy the detailed ending  just wished it had me humor and more for the other characters to do.

1466249,3,B00005JLRT,"Unfortunately not the greatest Star Trek movie, in fact of the 10 Trek movies i'd rank it #7. There are too many similarities with other movies i.e a madman with a doomsday weapon (see also The Wrath of Khan et al)a main character sacrificing himself (ditto spock in The wrath of Khan), the Enterprise getting beat up (virtualy every film)a countdown to the launch of the weapon (Insurrection, Khan) and so on. A pity and i felt let down. If this is the last Trek movie i won't be sorry.

1466250,5,B00005JLRT,"I LOVED IT!  Countless others will disagree with my opinion that this movie is a wondeful Star Trek flick, but I don't care.  Anyone who watched the entire seven season run of Star Trek The Next Generation, as well as watching all the ""TNG"" movies (Generations, First Contact, Insurrection), should love this movie.  And if you've been reading the Star Trek books that fill in the gaps between movies, you'll love it even more.  To me it's just the next installment in a great television phenomenon and I am very happy with the movie.  If you're a true fan of Star Trek The Next Generation, you won't be disappointed.
Plot-wise, it was very clever.  Wesley Crusher was in the movie after all (I had read his scene was cut, but lo and behold he makes an appearance anyway).  So was Guinan.  And, I think I even saw Ro Laren (that Bejoran trouble-maker who defected to the Maquis, remember?) at one point.  I think they should have used Admiral Necheyev (a recurring TNG admiral) instead of Admiral Janeway, although it was a nice homage to Star Trek Voyager having ol' Janeway in there, plus we sort of get to find out in part what has happened to the VOY crew since the ship made it back to Earth.
I really don't have any complaints at all.  I didn't see in glaring plot holes.  Every time I think of one, I come up with a reasonable explanation.  My wife wondered why Worf wasn't in Klingon Ambassadorial garb, since the last time we saw him he was still Ambassador to Kro'onos (did I spell that right?).  I explained that since he wasn't on the Klingon homeworld, and he was still in Starfleet, that he should rightly be in Starfleet uniform.  The other Worf-ism was why he was stationed at tactical.  Shouldn't the Enterprise have had a full time tactical officer?  Maybe Picard put Worf there for good ol' times' sake, after all Worf's saved his hide countless times.
The end of the movie was bittersweet.  I keep thinking about it.  I think everyone who's heard about the movie already knows that the main bridge crew is split apart in one form or another.  For that reason, any future TNG movies will be interesting.  How will they work in the various characters into one plot since they're no longer on the same ship?  They've sort of dodged the issue cleverly with Worf the last few movies.  But recall in Star Trek VI, they worked Captain Sulu into the film very nicely without too much plot contrivings.  One thing that will be interesting will be to see if anything becomes of B-4.  Will he stay on the Enterprise or be shipped off to Starfleet HQ to be studied and/or have certain memories extracted for posterity's sake?
Overall, a very strong movie.  If it's the last one, as the commercials and posters suggest, it's a good one to finish on.  If it's not the last one, there's still many adventures they could have that would make sense, and not leave the viewers wondering when the cast will retire.  After all, they're still quite young compared to the final movie the original series crew was in.  Go see it while it's still on the big screen!",1043020800,2,3061,4.526411657559199
1466251,2,B00005JLRT,"Once upon a time Star Trek movies seemed fresh and exciting.  They could be purely cerebral sci-fi stories like The Motion Picture, intergalactic mystery thrillers like Star Trek VI, or even outright comedy, like Star Trek IV.  They often quoted great works of literature knowledgably, touched upon current events and even featured wry comments on American history ( ""On Vulcan we have a saying: Only Nixon could go to China."")  They were intelligent movies made for an intelligent audience.  They presumed that the audience had read Dickens, Shakespeare, D.H. Lawrence, Arthur Conan Doyle, Melville and others.
The rankings of the characters also changed and the introduced new ones.  The movies with the original cast did things which took real risk with the characters.  Kirk was an Admiral for the first four movies, Chekov was not serving on Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II, and Sulu was Captain of Excelsior in Star Trek VI and never set foot on Enterprise.  This is in addition to killing off Spock, blowing up the Enterprise, spending one full feature flying around in a stolen Klingon vessel (until the last scene) and finally retiring the crew.  They did not exist simply to have space battles.  In point of fact some of the movies managed to get by with few or no space battles.  The original series and much of the Next Generation had similar standards of quality.
The Next Generation movies, in contrast, have been little more than extended episodes of varying quality.  No new recurring characters have been introduced and you can always count on seeing the original cast back on the bridge.  A great opportuninty for development was lost in Insurrection.  How cool it would have been to have Picard decide to retire on the planet right then and give Riker a field promotion to captain. Nemesis attempts to give us some development, unfortuneately it involves the death of a character at the climax whose potential for resurrection is made extremely obvious.  When Spock died in Star Trek II it was a moment of Tragedy which left me feeling cathartic, as well as extremely excited about Star Trek III which would be released in 2 long years. When a character died in Nemesis I felt like they were just imitating without understanding. I never had any feeling of loss or suspense.  Just a strong sense that I had seen it all before.
This may be the worst of the Trek films as it is little more than an extended space battle.  It was made by people who seem to have only seen the previous movies, found themselves most engaged by Star Trek II, and decided to repeat it.  These sequences have become so routine that, with a little more humor, I could compare it to elements of a James Bond movie.
In terms of topical discussions, it touches lightly on the theme of Cloning, just with a tad bit more seriousness than Star Wars Episode II.
Continuity is effected in terms of the rest of the series which makes me wonder if perhaps the film should be regarded as non-canonical, like the novels and, according to some, Star Trek V and the excellent animated series.  Perhaps in the next movie Picard or Riker or Data will wake up and all of this will have been a bad dream.",1042934400,14,3192,4.700179533213644
1466252,5,B00005JLRT,"Being a Trekkie, and holding The Next Generation as my favorite of the five series', of course I loved it.  But not just Trekkies would enjoy this movie.
Nemesis has a condensed plotline that isn't stretched with all-over-the-place extra details to confuse you.  It's plot, though new twists are added, follows a few select themes.  Yet, it is still deep and entwining.
I found myself on the edge of my seat the entire time.  I was excited, worried, anxious, happy, sad, hopeful... the whole she-bang.  It seems that the first two reviews I saw on this page were negative.  I, however, absolutely LOVED this movie.  That may be my Trekkie genetics (it's a family thing), but I seem to be far from the only ohne, Trekkie or not, to really like the film.
I think it's definitely worth it.  I am familiar with the characters bcause of my long-time addiction to the television series, but a lack of familiarity wouldn't, in my opinion, detract from the enjoyment.
There were, of course, a few things that could have been better.  But, overall, I think it was a wonderful film.
I'll stop here because if I continue, the way I say it may not get across without basically repeating that which I have already stated.  I find it hard to describe it, really, but I really loved this movie and I think that it is definitely worth every bit of time spent in its viewing.",1042761600,,1358,4.551440329218107
1466253,3,B00005JLRT,"On the plus side...Good performances (as always) by Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart. Fast paced plot, with no meandering subplots.  Better than average special effects.  Good ending.
On the minus side...Not much for the other stars to do except stand around.  Quite a number of absurdities (next time Captain Picard decides to ram a Romulan warship head-on he should remind the crew to fasten their seatbelts).
The biggest problem for me was the bad guys just weren't bad enough.  Considering how the Enterprise destroyed the Borg almost single-handedly, it's hard to take a pack of Romulan-Reman renegades seriously.  Maybe that's why the Next Gen movies are ultimately disappointing: it's tough to top the TV episodes!",1042761600,,721,5.234782608695652

Was I disapointed NO!. The film had everything from the battles to the marrige of riker and troi(something we all wanted to see). But like all films to wasn't perfact(like any movie is) some of the characters were underused but it would be very hard to make a story that would allow all characters a fair go.
The Character of shinzon was one hell of a bad guy, much better then Ru'afo from Insurrection, shinzon is more like the borg queen, my fav. Rom Perlman as the reman viceroy was exalent.
So the film way not have done so well at the Box office but that does't make it a bad film just underrated, if more people just started to ignore the critics and just go and see the movie then I think it could have done much better.

1466368,3,B00005JLRT,"This is another ST:TNG episode write large, and unfortunately it's not one of the better ones. There is a bit too much action and the moral of the story is kind of clunky. The opening in the Romulan senate is kind of interesting, but you don't feel that you're penetrating deep into the heart of the Romulan empire the way we've seen the workings of the Klingon empire in the past. Shinzon, Picard's clone, is a single note character, and it's distressing that his mouth looks so different from Patrick Stewart's. Since he's supposedly ill that must be the explanation. Meanwhile Ron Perlman plays Shinzon's ""Reman"" vice-roy, but he's got so much make-up on you wouldn't know it was him. His main role is to make one of those psychic sexual attacks against Deanna Troi, can't have a TNG movie without one of those. She meanwhile is marrying Riker. I missed the part where she broke up with Worf, and for all the jokes about nudity at her Betazed wedding, her mother is not even at the earthly wedding. (It's also ironic that Riker's doppelganger, Thom, isn't mentioned in a movie that's essentially about clones.) Kate Mulgrew makes a cameo as Janeway; she's an Admiral now no less. Again, I have no idea how she got from Captain of a lesser class vessel to Admiral, but she's there. This movie made me feel like I paid too much attention to the series and not enough. It pushes a lot of buttons, and it's pretty mediocre, but it is Trek .",1042502400,,1439,4.538461538461538
1466369,4,B00005JLRT,"If I said this movie was better than Generations or Insurrection, that wouldn't be saying much - most movies are. If I said it's not as good as First Contact, that's also not saying much - most movies aren't. So calling this movie the second best of the TNG movies is pretty pointless.
It's a good movie. It has some room for improvement, the fight scenes could have been more intense, the plot could have moved faster, blah blah blah... but overall, this is a pretty good movie. It's one of the VERY few movies in which you can sympathize with the bad guy, and I love that. It's not just ""Oh, I'm gonna go kill stuff because I'm so evil,"" the bad guy actually has realistic motives and very human virtues and flaws. Basically, this story is all about Picard and Shinzon, with Data providing a really minor subplot. There is much discussion about really deep stuff that I can't remember right now, mixed well with a slight and creepy feeling that something's not quite right. The plot holds more than a few surprises, the new Romulan ship looks cool inside and out, and... well, I really want to talk about Shinzon some more. This is totally his movie. He's the perfect tragic villain! I still have to wonder why he's bald, though. Isn't that something that should set in later in life? And his tight rubber suit is just funny, how it's so ultra-shiny and squeaks whenever he moves, so he moves really stiffly... it's just kinda funny when you think about it. There's also a lot of other cool stuff in the movie, like when the Enterprise smashes right into the Scimitar, and the part where people on the bridge get sucked out into space because part of the bridge is actually GONE. The fights on the interior of the Scimitar are really cool.
The flaws are very noticeable, but really minor. The Remians look like vampires that got assimilated by the Borg (in terms of skin tone and wierd veiny stuff), and no explanation is given for their appearance. The radiation on the Scimitar... where did it go? And WHAT'S WITH SHINZON'S RUBBER SUIT?
Nemesis has more depth than most Star trek movies, just the right amount of action, really cool visuals, and enough illogical details to satisfy most Trek fans. It's a very well-rounded and nice movie, but not exceptional.",1042416000,,2263,4.590123456790123
1466370,3,B00005JLRT,"WHAT I LIKED:
1)The interaction between the characters was first-rate. Character interaction has always been a hallmark of the Star Trek franchise. While Insurrection lacked it, Nemesis made up for it. Well done.
2)Characterization. Happily, Troi seemed like Troi, Riker seemed like Riker. Many of us have been following these characters for years. When we tune in, we want to see these characters, not reasonable fascimiles.
3)The action sequences were outstanding.
4)Tom Hardy worked as a young Picard.
WHAT BOTHERED ME:
1)This was hailed as the beginning of a new generation. All right? Where was it? From what I've heard, we were supposed to get a new First Officer. Where was he? It would have been nice to have seen him. Also, Dr. Crusher was supposed to have left the ship at the end of the film. Did I blink? Without these elements in place, it didn't seem like the beginning of a new generation.
2)The movie seemed to end suddenly. It didn't seem done. One minute we're mourning a crewmember, the next we're all smiling again.
3)There were apparently scads of missing scenes. Wesley Crusher was at the wedding, but he had no lines. What was the point? If he did film a scene with...you know...lines, it would have been appropriate to include it.
4)What was Worf doing on Enterprise? At the end if DS9, he was supposed to have left Starfleet. Don't get me wrong, I like him, but I don't appreciate unexplained slips in continuity.
5) Some time ago, the Enterprise discovered a prototype of Data---Lore. He turned out to be rather---loony. Yet nobody mentioned this when Enterpise discovered B4. Instead, they slapped B4 together, plugged him in, and then gave him Data's memories. You would think someone would have said ""Remember Data's other brother?""
All in all, it was a good movie. But not great. If they hadn't cut some of the scenes they cut, and if they had not left so many holes in continuity, it would have been brilliant. By the way, the missing scenes (the new First Officer, Crusher's goodbye) are in the book version.",1042329600,2,2040,4.798295454545454
1466371,2,B00005JLRT,"Perhaps the huge salary they paid to Patrick Stewart made the studio determined to figure out some way to make the fate of the cosmos depend upon him being in ever scene.  Do not get me wrong, Patrick Stewart is a wonderful actor, however this plot bordered on the ridiculous.
The movie will remind you of the very first Star Trek movie with V-Jer.  A very long, very slow build up to an unexciting climax.
The thing that made movies like ""The Wrath of Khan"" work, was an exciting plot throughout the movie, supported by understandable motives and good character development, when needed.  This movie struggles to introduce a new villain with a silly motive, all filmed in a dark gloomy sound stage.
the enterprise is summoned to Main planet of the Rommulan Empire because the new Preator wants to start negotiations.  They are suprised to hear that the new leader is not from the Planet Romulus but from it's sister planet Remus. (Fans of the books take note, this movie COMPLETELY departs from any continuity with the books, in which Romulus and Remus were twin planets jointly governing the empire and were colonized together.  In Nemesis, Remus is a locked in an orbit giving it a perpetual dark side, on which the remunds, a Pale, romulun subspecies resembling vampires, are used as slaves to mine the surface.
Picard and the crew meet the new leader, who strangly enough is human, and even stranger looks just like Picard 30 years earlier.  It is at this point that the movie completely withers, falling into a mass of cliches such as ""Shields down to 40% Captain""
I hope that the rumors of this being the last Star Trek movie are false as it would be a true shame to end the movie on such a sour note.",1042243200,3,1708,4.583606557377049

1466375,2,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis is a better movie than Star Trek: Insurrection and Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (or so memory serves, I haven't seen V in years).  Of course, that's hardly saying much, but at least it isn't as gag-inducing as the former and as laughable as the latter.  Rather, what we have here is the perfect opportunity for a rip-roaring actioner set in deep space, full of phaser combat and fight scenes, but all we get is a mostly dull thriller.
The reason is simple: the premise simply isn't that interesting, and this is a problem that has marred the films featuring The Next Generation crew.  No fresh or intriguing concepts are introduced or expanded.  All we get is the typical nature vs. nurture debate that's clumsily inserted into the dialogue on an occasional basis.  In case you have no idea what the story is, it's basically The Wrath of Khan with a Picard clone instead.
But such a premise could still set-up exciting action sequences, right?  In theory, yes, but director Stuart Baird doesn't really pull it off.  There are a few big action setpieces, including a pretty cool car chase on a desert planet (visually inspired by Pitch Black, given the sepia-tones and all), a firefight inside the warship Scimitar, and the all-out climactic space battle, which isn't as exciting as it may sound.
It's definitely the space battle that gets the most attention, and it runs for a little over twenty minutes, but how exciting can such a sequence be?  Watching two gargantuan starships taking shots at one another is pretty stagnant, it lacks the sense of mobility and speed an all-out aerial dogfight would have (a la Return of the Jedi).  That's not to say those twenty minutes don't have their moments.  There's another brief firefight on board the Enterprise (there should have been a lot more of these, as they prove to be the most exciting segments of the film) and an absolutely spectacular scene where the Enterprise rams into the Scimitar.  But for the most part, it's a long action sequence that's too talky (we're apparently supposed to be in suspense when ensigns shout that the shields are collapsing) and marred by a psychic link subplot that really slows the battle down.  If they plan to make a sequel and make it an action-oriented one, my advice: more firefights (or suspenseful situations a la First Contact), less starship stand-offs.
But complain as I might, there are still a few things I enjoyed.  Patrick Stewart is easily the best actor of any of the Star Trek series and it's always a pleasure to see the man reprise his role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  Brent Spiner is always reliable and convincing as Data, and once again, the film focuses primarily on these two characters.  The rest of the crew is left short-handed, given little to do other than perform what's required of them (Worf and Riker shoot down a few badguys, Geordi works on the engines, Dr. Crusher makes a few analyses, and Troi establishes a psychic link).  Tom Hardy makes for a really good villain, despite the fact that he sounds nothing like Stewart.
In the end, though, this is a mediocre film, with a few highlights here and there.  Even a major character's death is clumsily executed; the fact this one person happened to be my second favorite of the crew still didn't change the fact that I was quite unmoved by his passing.  It goes to show how a stilted delivery can really mute the emotional impact.

1466376,5,B00005JLRT,"Three years of anticipation and expectations have finally given way to Star Trek Nemesis.  For months now, we've had some truly wonderful trailers setting us up for this story, which by all accounts, the trailers looked extremely exciting.  Along with some great trailers, fans have been reading and hearing about some of the more interesting aspects of the plot.  Along with these and other factors, the producers have been raving about the fact that the author of ""Gladiator,"" a huge Star Trek Fan, is writing Nemesis and the usual excitement about the even numbered movies.  Put all of these ingredients in the pot and you have Star Trek Nemesis.  Included is a wonderful guest star appearance by the ever beautiful Dina Meyer of ""Starship Troopers"" fame.  This movie has some very wonderful moments in it, to include the long awaited marital union between Will Riker and Deanna Troi; some very humorous gibes between the crew and some stunning visual effects during the ""titanic"" battles between the Enterprise and the huge Reman and Romulan ships.  Credit to the designers of the new Romulan Warbirds, the Scimitar and the upgrades made to the Enterprise-E.  After seeing Nemesis a second time, I would have to say that, like Star Trek V, it takes a couple of viewings to fully appreciate this movie in its subtle and intricate details.
The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS
  Shinzon of Remus is a clone created somehow by Captain Jean Luc Picard's DNA.  Apparently sometime during Captain Picard's time on the USS Stargazer a Romulan agent pilfered his DNA in some form.  This, in and of itself, would make a great story in Michael Jan Friedman's Stargazer series!
Remus is the second planet in the Romulan Star Empire.  Apparently, due to its lack of rotation as it revolves around the Romulan Star, one side of Remus is continuously bathed in sunlight and high radiation.  Its inhabitants only live on the dark side.  They have also become subservient to Romulus.  Shinzon, a human clone, originally part of a Romulan plan to replace Captain Picard has been abandoned by the Romulans and left to the mines on Remus.  He is taken in by the Remans and as he grew up, he inspires a revolution by the Remans.  This revolution has culminated in his taking over the Romulan senate.  Now in charge of the Senate, he desperately needs something from Captain Picard, so he invites Picard and the Enterprise, under the flag of peace, to Romulus.  Once Captain Picard gets over the initial shock of meeting his clone, he must decide whether Shinzon is being truthful or preparing to do war!  {ssintrepid}",1041724800,7,2593,4.85876993166287

But who could miss a chance to spend a couple of hours with Warf, Jean Luc and the gang?  When our most faithful Trekkie friend decided to go, we all piled in the car and off we went.  I am so glad we joined her!  We all agreed -- it is by far the best of all the Star Trek films.  It's fast-paced, exciting, moving, gripping; it will have you clinging to the edge of your seat, whether you're a teenage boy or...a little older...

1466455,4,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis, in my opinion, was an excellent movie, in the sense there were lots of action scenes and angles that the viewer could focus upon. Despite all the informative comments concerning how this fared in comparison with the previous nine Star Trek motion pictures, as well as the Star Wars box office blockbusters, there were some holes in the story I could not quite fill in.
The part that bewildered me by far was where upon the destruction of the core of a massive ship that contained several doses of radiation that were to be used to destroy an entire planet, there was set off an explosion comparable to that in either Stargate or Independence day, and after that incident, the Enterprise, which seemed to be in close proximity while being in a dire predicament of no warp capabilities and virtually no shields, somehow remained intact. How could this be possible, even in the Star Trek universe?",1041465600,3,903,4.75796178343949
1466456,4,B00005JLRT,"Overall, I enjoyed STAR TREK: NEMESIS. If this is indeed the final film featuring the Next Generation cast, it is a fitting swan song. The film brings together the cast in a way that the other movies did not. It is also probably the 2nd best Next Generation film (FIRST CONTACT being the best).
The film opens with the wedding of Riker and Troi. Wesley Crusher is seen (wearing a Star Fleet uniform nonetheless!), but only at the wedding table. Riker gets command of his own ship, but he doesn't get to helm it in this movie and his honeymoon is delayed because of the discovery of the quartered B-4 (the prototype for Data) and a new leader on Romulus. The film has some fairly interesting fight scenes and most of the main cast members get some decent screen time. However, the movie parallels (among other films) THE WRATH OF KHAN a great deal and that unfortunately makes the essential elements of the plot predictable. I don't want to give anything away, but will say this: Lear just won't be the same without his Fool.
A fairly decent sci-fi movie and one of the better Star Trek films. I doubt this will be the last Trek film, but if it is, the song ends with a sweet melody.",1041465600,5,1182,4.426605504587156
1466457,5,B00005JLRT,... The movie I thought was very good. Action seens were a lot better. It would be nice to see a good enhanced DVD since they did horrible at the box office.,1041465600,,157,3.9375
1466458,4,B00005JLRT,"My thoughts about Nemesis when I left the theatre was of being unfullfilled by what happened in the film. It was a good idea I thought to use the Romulans and Remans. Using the controversy of cloning as a theme of the movie was a good idea. The special effects were good. But what bothered me were the things that were not in the movie. Having read the novel before I went in to see the movie may have been a bad idea, but it also let me know some of the things that were removed from the movie. I understand about 40 minutes were cut from the film and much of it was things the fans would have liked. I highly recommend to the powers that be at Paramount that they reinsert the missing pieces in the DVD to satisfy the fans. I also thought Data's death was unnecessary. It would perhaps have been much more interesting to see how Data would have handled becoming first officer of the Enterprise, seeing how his interactions with Picard and B4 would change due to his promotion and becoming B4's mentor. One omission that perturbed me was when in the middle of the battle the Enterprise ran out of photon torpedoes, but nobody mentioned anything about the quantum torpedoes. Also, what kind of ship was the Titan? Was Riker getting a Sovereign,  Galaxy or Prometheus class ship to command or an old rust bucket?
Personally, I'm hoping it's a Prometheus class. One thing neither the book nor the movie addressed is what is Wesley doing back in the picture. These are fan items of interest that the fans would have liked to know, and I suspect the 40 minutes of additional footage would have answered at least some of these questions. Nemesis was good, but could have been so much better.",1041465600,,1686,4.456310679611651

They then get invited to Romulus for talks.
Turns out it is all a ploy and the real reasons are uncovered by the crew. At this point all hell breaks loose.
The story line of the movie is very well done. But I think that the challenge of this adversary as challenging as say the Borg. The movie is very action packed but for being the last next generation movie I think that it could of ended it with a real challenge.",1041379200,2,734,4.25
1466460,4,B00005JLRT,"After the vast disappointment Paramount gave us with ""Insurrection"" (one of the worst of the series), they make up for that loss with #10 in the long-running series of, in my opinion, the best sci-fi movie series ever.  The plot is pretty imaginative, all except for the clone part, which seems pretty run-of-the-mill sci-fi stuff after ""Episode II"" and the ""Austin Powers"" movies.  But, the plot simply wouldn't be as good, or work as well, without it, and it is handled very well.  The plot is, however, at times somewhat confusing and underplayed, but not much.  And one can easily spot some similarities between this and other previous Trek films; ""The Wrath of Khan"" most of all, as well as ""The Undiscovered Country"", and even a dab or two of ""The Search For Spock"".  But these aside, it's a highly enjoyable movie, and makes a worthy end to the big screen voyages of Picard n' crew.  The whole Enterprise (which, by the way, looks better than ever) crew is in top form, of course.  The guy who plays Shinzon gives a highly entertaining, and different, performance.  While not trying to be as menacing as a Klingon or Khan, he gives a stand-out performance as the ""Nemesis"" of the title (and he really does look like a younger Patrick Stewart).  The ending is exciting and tense; yet, there is a sense of sadness as well (especially ********* to ruin it would be futile), but also of hope...........as with ""The Undiscovered Country"", which was the last voyage of the original Enterprise crew.
""Star Trek: Nemesis"" is well-worth seeing on the big screen, and is certainly tied with ""First Contact"" as the best of the Next Generation film series.  Well worth the 4-year wait!
(Now I wonder if they'll make a film series of ""Deep Space Nine"", which I think would be interesting to see;  I haven't seen more than one full episode of that series, but what I remember of it was really boring.  but it had a great theme!  And after that, maybe films of ""Voyager""?  ""Enterprise""?)",1041292800,2,1979,4.682080924855492
1466461,4,B00005JLRT,"""Star Trek: Nemesis"" reteams the crew from the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" TV series and ensuing feature films. Once more, we enter the sci-fi world of the intrepid crew of the Starship ""Enterprise."" This latest installment in the ongoing ""Trek"" saga opens with turmoil on Romulus, the homeworld of one of humanity's perennial foes. The ""Enterprise,"" still under the command of Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), is sent out to deal with the situation. The film introduces a new alien race: the Remans, who hail from Romulus' sister planet. Key to the story is Shinzon, who grew up on the Reman homeworld yet has a strange and very personal connection to Picard.
""Nemesis"" certainly has a lot of good elements going for it. The Remans, who reminded me of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" type demons, are a visually impressive alien race, and equally impressive is Shinzon's massive warship. There are some well played action sequences, and it's great to see the Next Gen crew together again.
But I felt by the film's end that its makers had aimed for an epic scope and emotional resonance which they never quite achieved. While the film is certainly a great improvement over the last Next Gen feature (the limp ""Insurrection""), it never achieves the heights reached in the best of the Next Gen films (""First Contact"") or in the best of the TV episodes.
Maybe part of the problem is the villain Shinzon, played by Tom Hardy. He too often comes across as a petulant schoolboy. I didn't fully buy him as the brilliant, battle-hardened military commander he allegedly is. He's not in the same league as Trek's best villains, like Khan or the Borg Queen. Also, while the Remans are visually striking and as a species have a compelling history, I felt that in the end they were underdeveloped as a new alien race. And while Ron Perlman brings a commanding presence to his role as the Reman Viceroy, I felt the filmmakers seriously underutilized his great talents.
Other aspects of the film struck me as gratuitous or clumsily put together (particularly some sexual innuendo that seems stuck at a junior high mentality). And, like ""Star Trek: Insurrection,"" some aspects of the film had a ""been there, done that"" feel to them; Hardy's Shinzon in particular felt uncomfortably like a rip-off of a certain blonde nemesis already faced by the Next Gen crew during their TV run.
These gripes aside, I must still say that I enjoyed ""Nemesis,"" and I do hope that this film is not the end of the line for either the Next Gen crew or the toothy Remans.",1041292800,2,2534,4.761363636363637
1466462,4,B00005JLRT,"As a Star Trek feature film, ""Nemesis"" is at least in the top five (of ten). As a stand-alone science fiction movie, however, it is probably average.

Screenwriter and self-described lifelong Trekkie John Logan (""Gladiator"") indulged in a bit of wish fulfillment by shaking up things among the characters and trying out new toys. This is both a help and a hindrance in ""Nemesis"" case. The script has smatterings of inside jokes that aren't very funny and characters utter lines they'd probably never say in their television incarnations. And the introduction of a space dune buggy was distractingly embarassing, to put it kindly.

But - all in all - the positives still outweight these negatives.

The villain Shinzon is more than a two-dimensional psychopath. He's a three-dimensional neurotic! A clone of the Enterprise's captain, Jean Luc Picard, Shinzon is a case study in nature versus nurture. Possessing Picard's intelligence, passion, and strength, he is saddled with fears and pains that create a horribly vengeful and destructive man. Picard's face-to-face dealings with his double provide a ""there but for the grace of God go I"" mirror to his own life. Picard was raised by a provincial jerk but at least his childhood wasn't spent on a perpetually dark planet working as a slave. This is no excuse for bad behavior, however, and it's made clear that Shinzon does have the power to choose.

Logan also purposely made the empath Deanna Troi useful for more than having unsure feelings about things and looking good in a revealing top. His solution was simple (maybe even implausible) but it had the virtue of novelty and poetic justice.

The greatest hindrance is the Data subplot, which unnecessarily parallels the Picard story. Data finds (yet another) long-lost prototype for himself, the B-4 (aka, Data Gump). But it provides a back door for possible future stories.

There won't be any future stories, however, if ""Nemesis"" gets even worse box office overseas than it did stateside. I hope that's not the case. This one was pretty good.",1041206400,3,2051,5.035398230088496
1466562,2,B00005JLRT,"Moronic.  That about sums it up.  But it would be unfair to fellow Star Trek fans to leave it at that.  The one positive thing I can say about Nemesis is that the villain reminded me of Dr. Evil.  That at least gave me a reason to crack a smile.
Make no mistake.  This is the worst of the Star Trek movies.  (I am well aware of just how bad Star Trek V was.  But at least it had decent special effects.) The main problem is a bad story.  Not too many ways around that, unfortunately.  Not even Patrick Stewart's wonderful way with a phrase can dig him out of this silly story line and just plain bad dialogue.  This is the kind of script that would get you laughed out of any screenwriting competition.
Now, the ""idea"" behind Nemesis could provide nice fodder for a decent storyteller.  Indeed, the movie's timing couldn't have been better with the core plot device resonating in the headlines.  Without giving away details, it's a story of a clone, but with not a shred of originality, coherence, and provocativeness about it.  In the right hands, it could have been turned into a fascinating study on the Manchurian Candidate, or a wrenching moral drama about human identity and the issues raised by genetic tinkering.  But no.  This is a story that probably was written by a sixth grader.  And not a smart one.
Indeed, even retaining the basic plot structure, it is possible that a good writer might have made this at least into a compelling drama--the rise of a young Reman slave, the intrigue of a rebellion within the shadowed hallways of Romulus, the conflict borne when a Federation captain cannot bear to betray his duplicate.  But, it's all wishful thinking from a Star Trek fan who has just watched butcherous slobs hack a long-running saga to pathetic ribbons.  (If I could include an audio clip here, it would be the sound of a thousand rhesus monkeys wailing.)
Aside from sending the writers and producers to a penal colony in a distant galaxy, it's also time to retire the crew.  Will Riker, looking as plump as James Doohan in his final outings, appears to be morphing into Burl Ives.  Troy looks almost as decrepit.  Data?  Let's just say that he's been reduced to bad singing and bad jokes, but fortunately he finds a decent cure.  Worf?  He's marginalized and emasculated.  If he were  a real Klingon, his brother would have hunted him down and put him out of his misery.  Of the entire lot, only Picard acquits himself passably.  And we're forced to suffer cameos by the equally insufferable Guinan and ""Admiral"" Janeway.
Am I urging you not to see this?  Absolutely.  Go rent First Contact, or even Insurrection.  Or better yet, grab a few DVDs of the ORIGINAL Star Trek, when they had great writers and great stories.  With this kind of tripe, I'm sure Gene Roddenberry is spinning in his grave.  Let's not make it any worse for him by lining the pockets of the greedy and untalented thieves who coopted the Star Trek franchise and turned it into moron-ville.
Finally, the special effects and editing are poor, too.  Everything gets foggy and disjointed where it shouldn't to cover for a lack of technological skill and attention to detail.  This is short-cut and cheapskate stuff, ladies and gentlemen.  And even the aliens are cardboard cut-outs.  Ugh.  Which only makes it worse, since you know that the big budget is only going to make the swine behind this film richer, not into a better looking movie.",1041120000,14,3429,4.625207296849088

The biggest surprise for me was the newest villain: Shinzon.  In spite of it all, it was so hard to dislike him: his pain and suffering, his bitterness and anguish were all too understandable.  In addition, he did not look like a villain but like a hopelessly lost tormented soul.  I even found myself hoping that Picard could find a way to help him. If one looks beyond the movie and its trappings, this movie can give a lesson in humanity. Did Shinzon deserve his fate in the end or was he a helpless product of his environment?

The film has some fine comedic moments. The special effects are superior. The plot is not the strongest in the series of movies produced under this dynasty. I agree that it draws from many other movies from the series. Not bad in and of itself but you can certainly tell that the screenwriters have seen a lot of Star Trek movies in which to pattern this one from. The Data storyline is almost laughable and of course leaves the door open for sequals. Just wait and you will see! Overall the movie was not bad.,1041033600,,653,4.45
1466566,5,B00005JLRT,"After anticipating the release of Nemesis for more than a year, and then reading what critics had to say about this film (which was a lot of negative), I went into the theatre with excitment yet dissapointment.  When I came out, it was all excitement.  The story in Nemesis was not very strong, but the action in this movie blew me away - if you like what Star Trek is famous for, which is huge ship to ship battles in space, this movie has one of the best ever.  As for the actual story, it's all about Picard vs. his younger clone, Shinzon.  I think Shinzon has a weak intro in the movie (if he is to be presented as a great villan) but as the movie progresses, he looks and acts more aggressive. I love the Remans also, especially Shinzon's viceroy (Ron Pearlman).  He has this deep, dark voice and a way of getting into other people's minds and tormenting them.  If you would like to compare this to any other Trek movie, this is the best ever for special effects and the ship battles.  As for story and best villan, that it is not.  Star Trek II is always going to be the best, no matter what.  It really is impossible to beat a classic.  But Nemesis is the best TNG movie after First Contact.  If you want a story that makes you think and is interesting, this probably isn't it but if you want to relax and not think about the movie but just enjoy what it has to offer, you really need to see Nemesis.",1041033600,,1407,4.193308550185874
1466567,3,B00005JLRT,"I had never been so excited or in such anticipation as I waited for ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" to start.  It had been four years since my favorite crew had graced the big screen and I was [eager] to find out what happened next.  So after all the hype, all the waiting and waiting and WAITING, here's what I thought.
As with every Star Trek film, the special effects were fantastic, the score was powerful, and the acting was good.  Stuart Baird did a fairly decent job directing his first Trek as well.  But we all know there is more to making a good film, and this fourth TNG installment lacks in these other crucial areas.
First of all, the story (and I won't give away what hasn't been seen in commercials) was weaker than other Trek films.  It seems the sci-fi cinema world has gone clone-crazy.  Gee, if filmmakers had stuck to the ""every two years"" schedule of generating Trek movies, they might have beaten ""Attack of the Clones"" to theatres instead of having the plot that says, ""Been there, done that.""
Secondly, there were considerable gaps between action sequences.  And if the dialogue is not interesting enough to maintain audience fixation (and in many places it unfortunately wasn't), the movie will tend to drag.  It started to seem like a very long two hours in some places in the film.  Suspense did start to build around big moments, but it almost always led to nothing too spectacular.
Small pet peeve note:  Why in the 24th century does a ""new"" vehicle have wheels?
I did like the character of Shinzon ...but he's no Khan.  However, the more I watched him, the more I believed he would pass for a younger Picard.
But the biggest problem I had with this particular installment was the characterization of Captain Picard.  Throughout these four films we have seen him kind of loosen up in his stringent ways.  But why is he suddenly a rebel space cowboy?  Trek fans respect Picard because he has a sense of order and duty, but now he wants to be part of every away-team mission and live dangerously.  One can't help but make Kirk comparisons, and I really hoped that Picard would always be a foil for the original captain.  Shame.
Don't get me wrong, I always enjoy Trek movies and this one was no exception.  I just hope it's not the last one.  I don't feel like the TNG crew went out with the bang that they deserve.  I have an idea:  Let's bring the Borg back for one final showdown.  Let's reunite the crew with their favorite annoyance, Q.  And let's fill in all the gaps, answer all the questions, and give each character a respectful send-off.  Name the date, I'll be there.",1040947200,6,2594,4.51931330472103
1466568,4,B00005JLRT,"Not hardly. ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" is, in my opinion, the best ""Trek"" film since ""Star Trek IV."" Now, I was never a fan of the 'Next Generation' series, however I have always been a fan of teh ""Star Trek"" movies...why? Who knows, probably my undying love for science fiction. Anyhoo, I thought that this film attempted to recapture the energy of those first set of films that featured Kirk & Spock. In fact, one could almost draw some, although thin, comparisons to ""Trek II & III."" I wasn't expecting much from this film going into it, as the critics had harpooned it and called the franchise 'dead.' I tend to disagree. I think that this film was quite different from any ""Trek"" film in years, mainly due to the fact that there was a new director on board - Stuart Baird. The movie packs quite a bit of action, some fantastic space battles, clever dialogue and an emotional gut-punch of an ending. Admittedly, the plot was very complex and at points hard to follow, however if you know anything about ""Star Trek,"" you know that you are in for a great thrill ride of a movie. Great sound, a really good looking new ship - the Enterprise-E, and a trailer before the film for the best show on TV - ""Enterprise.""

The franchise is not dead, and I can not think of any reason that a ""Star Trek"" fan should be upset or disappointed by this film.

Once again, the biggest ""nemesis"" to Star Trek is the over-analyitical and impossible-to-please fanbase. The truth is, this is a fun and interesting film...which is all a movie audience can ask for!
This Star Trek film is not perfect, but is among the best of the series with a great deal of genuine emotion, action, suspense, warmth, and a worthy villian. Screenwriter John Logan has given the franchise a new feel and direction with his script. This, combined with Stuart Baird's fresh, cinematic direction, has resulted in the first ""Next Generation"" film that doesn't feel as if it belongs on television.
The film's plot involves a political coup on the Romulan homeworld. A race that had been slaves to the Romulan Empire for centuries, the Remans,  have risen up behind the prestige and leadership of a human slave-warrior named Shinzon. As it turns out, Shinzon is calling for peace and the Enterprise is sent in to open negotiations. It soon turns out that Shinzon is not what he appears to be and that the Romulan / Reman alliance is interested in anything BUT peace.
The plot is secondary to the warm reunion of the cast of this celebrated series. It is truly a joy to see the crew back together again. There is a warmth and comradere that comes across on the screen that is genuine and impossible to fake. As many have mentioned, there were several character scenes cut from this film (over 50 minutes apparently) that will hopefully make it back into the DVD version. The wedding scene and the scenes between Picard and Riker were particularly good. Essentially, to boil it down, the film is about family and the acceptance of personal change. This type of character interaction and the friendships of the crew have always been the greatest appeal of ""Star Trek"", and ""Nemesis"" realizes this and successfully capitalizes!
Another prime ingrediant to a successful ""Trek"" is great, meaningful conflict. Again, the story provides this in earnest. Shinzon turns out to be a twisted and murdering clone of Picard. The question of genetic pre-disposition versus upbringing and ""learned behavior"" is brought up to the fullest. In one scene (one of the best in the film) Picard confronts Shinzon, telling him that he has the potential and capability of being a better man. He pleas that he is incapable of comitting mass-murder. The beauty of it is, that somewhere behind actor Tom Hardy's eyes, you can see the brief flicker of indecision as he considers the possibilities. This outlines the other basic theme of the picture: the idea that to live is to struggle to make yourself a better person. The chemistry between Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy's charismatic villian is electrifying.
The action is easily the best and most suspensful since the classic ""Wrath of Khan"" film. There are some fun hand-to-hand (and phaser-to-phaser) battles, a ""Road Warrior"" syle dune buggy sequence, and a fabulous ship-to-ship battle that leaves the viewer with the impression of two heavyweight boxers slugging it out in the 15th round, fighting with their last ounce of strength.
Despite what the nit-picking hardcore fans will have you believe, each character is given ample opportunity to shine. Data is, of course, the other primary along with Patrick Stewart's Picard. Riker is pivotal and has some great action stuff to do, as well as some meaningful character evolution. Getting equally good treatment is Deanna Troi, who is essential to the plot as well. Geordi and Worf have fun moments and Dr. Crusher is more prevailant than in other films, but still somewhat ignored. The idea needs to be gotten across to the fans that there simply isn't TIME to give everyone an ""Academy Award worthy"" role.
Essentially, this is an intellegent action film that raises the typical intellegent Star Trek quesions about the nature of humanity and growth. The plot is actually fairly simple, and works only to serve the emotions of the characters and the action-packed final 45 minutes. The film plays appropriate tribute to what has come before, while at the same time appearing fresh and challenging the future. Ignore the professional critics and the ""fans"" who have their own agenda in mind. If you want to be entertained with that old ""Star Trek"" magic, put your cares behind and buckle-up...because it's back in full force with ""Nemesis""!",1040947200,3,4444,4.973118279569892

1466657,4,B00005JLRT,"I've been following the adventures in the trek universe as long as I can remember.  There are times when I think ""I could have written that better"", but then again, who couldn't?  There isn't a movie or book in the world that couldn't be improved upon continueously when you really think about it.
The fact is that trek is fun to watch, and there is always some lesson to learn about humanity and it's hang-ups.  When someone gets upset about a seeming inconsistency between stories---I tell them to remember that there are always the gaps between the stories that are ripe for exploration.  Instead of complaining about it, why not write a book about how Worf came back to the Enterprise from his Ambassador's post?  Or a book about how Wesley came back home to Starfleet after time with the Traveler.  I'll be the first one to admit that I'd like to see some of Janeway's D Quadrant experiences reflected in Earth's evolution---but we don't even know whether or not the Reman ship would have penetrated Earth's defenses or not, because they never made it even close to Earth.  Had Shinzon destroyed the Enterprise and continued on to sector 001, we might have seen a few surprises from Janeway's corner.  Picard simply didn't want to risk letting the deadly weapon get any further.
Bottom line, Trek is always fun to watch.  Forget the harsh critiques and enjoy the show.  Maybe even write some ""gap"" stories of your own.  At least in this world of cookie cutter culture it gets us thinking and talking about something other than those so called ""reality"" shows!",1040860800,,1564,4.713235294117647
1466658,5,B00005JLRT,"This was a good movie.  The starship battle scenes were well done and Picard had to fight a formidable foe.  But the central message of the movie -- that we are the product of a life experience rather than our genes could not have been better illustrated.  Picard has to fight a clone of himself who grew up in a horrible environment.
In other words the movie is about making yourself better despite your bad upringing.  But there is a problem with that -- how can you make yourself better if you don't know what is wrong with you?  Or if you are about to die?  Picard's ""brother"" does not have a family, and so there is no legacy.  Thus there is nothing really to pass on.  His death means nothing because his life is meaningless.
If we try to better ourselves, we have to do it for a purpose.",1040688000,4,794,4.246666666666667
1466659,4,B00005JLRT,"I have mixed feelings regarding this movie. Overall, it was better than the odd numbered Star Trek movies, and a few of the even ones. I enjoyed the fact that the Romulans finally get involved in a theatrical Star Trek episode. However, it is a clone of Picard that steals the Romulans potential thunder in this one. Instead, the Federation is fighting against the Remans, who have taken some control of the Romulan Empire.
Shinzon, albeit young, plays a good Nemesis to Picard. During the movie, we see Shinzon suffering pain, which is his main reason to lead Picard to Romulus. He tries convincing Picard that the new Romulan Empire wants peace with the Federation. Of course, Picard doesn't fall for his subterfuge.
This leads to the action of the movie, and falls in line with space action scenes in other Trek movies.
Very good dialogue especially between Picard and Shinzon. Data plays a very big role, and early in the movie discovers an android similar to him called B4. B4, will probably be seen in the future, but do not want give away the surprise ending.
This movie could have been a two parter on the TV series. It appears that the TNG crew is done. Stewart has announced that this was his last the other day. The Trek movie I'd like to see would be to have a mix of all 4 series tied up to one movie, similar to the Dominion Wars in novel form. That would make a better theater experience",1040601600,5,1402,4.5019607843137255

Star Trek has arrived at its tenth Silver screen movie and hasn't lost its fire yet. Being an avid Trek fan myself, I found much entertainment value even in the heavily-edited-for-time release of Nemesis. From Enterprise crew advancements to some appearances by a few favourite characters (Guinan, Wesley, Janeway - Admiral mind you), the intricacies of the Romulan Empire as well as the main battle sequence, Nemesis doesn't let up.
Some movie (over)analysts might blast Nemesis, however, at some point these individuals seem not to understand either the continuity of Trek or the fact that all movies have a time and budgetary limit. All things considered Nemesis is a must see, even if only to be part of a particular watershed event for the TNG crew (not revealing it just in case...).
Shinzon, the villian of the piece, is topped in dark presence only by Khan (Kirk's arch foe) or Locutus (the other version of an ""evil Picard""). Stellar performances by our usual crew.
My final word for this movie: ignore the critics, watch it for fun.",1040515200,4,1136,4.891191709844559
1466661,5,B00005JLRT,"I may be a little partial in this review since I am a huge fan of Star Trek, especially TNG, but I must say it was an excellent movie. If this is the last movie with the cast of Next Generation, what an ending. Fantastic final journey.
Everyone who's ever watched the series has come to expect only the best from this cast.  And this was no exception. Quite possibly the best Star Trek movie to date.
First, the entire cast is present to take the part in this adventure, including Mr. Crusher, who has a cameo in the beginning of the film.
Second, the story line is brilliant. It is a lot richer complemented by excellent performances.  One to mention here would be Tom Hardy portraying Praetor Shinzon, one of the best villains the crew of Enterprise had to face. After all we are all used to seeing brilliant performances from Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner.
Visual effects and action scenes are excellent, as expected. But not to be misleading, Enterprise does not blow up everything that comes across.
Only down side was an extraordinarily fast pace of the movie. Filmmakers must have been determined to keep this movie under 2 hr.  Lets hope all deleted material will be present on DVD.
All an all, great movie with great ending. Simplicity of the ending is probably what made it so good. Too bad it was released less then a week before Two Towers. ...",1040515200,8,1359,4.538775510204082

The movie features good acting from Stewart and Hardy, a decent Goldsmith score, state-of-the-art effects, but the story is somewhat recycled from earlier films in the franchise.
Yeah, it works for Bond, but Trek was always more about originality. Sadly, while enjoyable, ""Nemesis"" brings nothing new to the table, with the exception of the Picard-Shinzon connection.
But, loyalty is hard to break; thus, I will be buying the DVD, reported to have some additional footage.",1040428800,,602,5.28125
1466663,3,B00005JLRT,"I'm a lifelong Trek fan. The Landru episode aired on the night I was born and I've been watching Trek ever since. So, naturally I went to see Nemesis. There is good and bad news. First the good stuff: This movie is 100% better than the icky Insurrection.
 Now for the bad: Nemesis suffers from inconsistancies and bad writing. Shinzhan, who makes an excellent bad guy and is a bright spot in the film, has never seen a human woman before and is fascinated by Troi. Instead of using that to the Federation's advantage Troi acts like a schoolgirl when he asks if he can touch her hand.  Wesley Crusher is wearing a Star Fleet dress uniform. Why? Didn't he leave Star Fleet years ago? Worf is back on the Enterprise. Didn't he return to the Klingon homeworld at the end of the Dominion War? Riker, in a crucial fight scene stops, stares and watches a Reman escape down a chute. That made not a lick of sense. The Enterprise is still vulnerable to the cloaking device. Why? After all these years why hasn't the Federation come up with a cloak of its own? Where is the rest of the fleet? Throughout a serious confrontation nobody from Starfleet sends even a short message to the Enterprise. Shinzhan's motivation for going after earth is so weak that Piccard should've been able to talk him out of it.
Ultimately, I enjoyed Nemesis but it should have been better. Trek people like me will go see and some of us will grumble but I don't see this one pulling in non fans.",1040428800,,1464,4.438661710037175
1466664,4,B00005JLRT,"Nemesis had its moments, it was great to see most of the cast still functioning. Even though they were on the 'chunky' side. Alas, Star Trek has run its course, and there does not seem to be another mission, except into that black hole that awaits all over used franchises. New stock, new worlds, new blood. else we are just simply following a weekly episode of  Lost In Space.
I can say these things as I am an avowed Star Trek fan, and it is with great pain that I would say 'cut the series', but its gone on too long.
The Jean Luc clone was a twist that I had not forseen and I really liked the idea and the way it was worked out.
Tom Hardy (Black Hawk Down, Band Of Brothers.) as Praetor Shinzon did an excellent job and the close up of Shinzon and Jean Luc, looking deeply into each others eyes to see who would blink first was a great scene. Picard searching his enemies mind for a resemblance of his own youth, not unlike a Narcissistic love affair....  The Alien's were great and the action was there but so was long scene's of trite dialog with #1 Troi and Picard.
With the loss of one of the crew , but the gaining of another, the loss will not be profound.

There are no weak points to this movie and the movie was well written and presented. This movie does have the same emotions and style as ""The Wrath of Khan"" and is well worth spending money to buy or go and see in theaters.
While reading other reviews for this movie, I feel that people who write most of these reviews are not true Star Trek fans or can not understand the true meaning behind Star Trek. Star Trek is definetly not like Star Wars. One difference being is the fact that Star Wars does not have Teleporters.
This movie had the Star Trek soul to it and for the people who are not Star Trek fans, then I would have to tell you to not go and see it. Because, it is hard to gather the emotion to understand the characters if you have not watched all the Star Trek movies. For the people that have never seen a Star Trek movie, it may be wise to learn first what Star Trek is all about, rather then deciding a bad review for a movie that has characters you can't understand.

The plot of star trek nemesis is nothing new clones new starships its all been done before.

All in all I would NOT AND I ME NOT recommand this movie to any one looking for star wars type space battles. for people turning to star trek looking for big space battles I recommand the following movies. The first one is star trek first contact.
The only star trek movie I bought I own the dvd version. the other star trek movie is the tv movie star trek deep space nine the way of the warrior and star trek voyager scorpion both were two hour specials these movies can be enjoyed by any star wars fan or babylon 5 fan.

1466750,4,B00005JLRT,"I found Nemesis to be an enjoyable movie. Many have been critical of the film for its lack of a creative story line.  I am in agreement with that criticism. Although, I'm sure the critics would be praising the flick if it were an ""Arnold"" or ""Bruce"" film.  As shootem-up space cowboy films go, this is a good one.
BUT, I think we are long overdue for a real scifi adventure.  Surely, there are enough interesting story lines from any of the Trek series upon which to develop a real scifi adventure. One that has imagination and the feeling of the awesomeness that only scifi as a genre can bring.
I'm not tired of Trek.  I watch the reruns of all the series.  I tune it faithfully to see Enterprise.  I will continue to do so, because its the best viewing on the tube.
But, scifi films in general are suffering.  The last movie to step outside the ""cowboys in space"" formula was Mission to Mars.  It borrowed from a lot of different films.  But, at least it was an attempt to do something different.  (Although it seemed everyone hated the flick.  I didn't!)
TNG needs a new, younger crew!  Maybe draw some members from the other series to feel the roles on the Enterprise. (I wouldn't mind seeing 7of9 on the big screen!)  But, most importantly we need some real innovation in the story line.  The best episodes from any of the TV series are the ones that made the viewer think and wonder.  Don't stop making movies.

1466751,3,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: Nemesis is definitely not the worst Trek film to date (That distinction would go to Insurrection or Final Frontier). But it's also nowhere near the best. Falling smack dab in the midst of mediocrity, this film is crying to be great but feels like a paint by numbers Van Gough.
Centered on the story of a subclass of Romulans gaining control of its council with the intent of taking over the Federation, the film follows the generation crowd at a time of change as second in command Will Riker and his new wife, ship's counselor Deana Troi, ready to leave the crew. It seems like the over-all theme of the film is supposed to be endings and new beginnings, but that bittersweet concept seems lost in the mostly uninteresting Romulan plot line. What is most frustrating though, is while Nemesis is better then the last Trek film, Insurrection, it had potential to be one of the best of the series. Instead the great scenes are hidden behind the tedious plot. Excellent character moments are screaming to get out, but are replaced either by boring plot developments or ill-placed comedic relief.
On the flip side, the special effects are probably some of the best Trek effects yet. But as is becoming more and more evident in modern film, effects don't make a good movie. There are also some fun cameos early on in during what is probably the best scene. In fact, the first fifteen minutes of the movie seemed like it was headed in the right direction. But that was all before the plot took a death grip on it.
If Nemesis' story could be related to any other Trek film, it would be that of The Wrath of Kahn, with its similar plot and structure. But this latest seems to be only a pale imitation of Kahn's brilliance. Definitely worth skipping until the video is released, except for the die-hard Trekkies.",1040169600,,1814,4.601851851851852

Plus, when the bad guys sneak up on the good guys and are 10 feet away and fire and miss, and this happens over and over in this movie, it takes any sense of realism out of the picture. Plus, the dune buggy sequence is also ridiculous and totally detracts from any sense of real danger or realism.  Patrick Stewart is a great actor, but he said in interviews that he had a hard time ""finding"" Picard for this movie.  I'm not sure he ever found him.  A great disappointment and one of the worst of the Star Trek movies, if not the worst.  The ""friction"" between Picard and Shinzon was nothing compared to that between Kirk and Khan.

A Very bad weapon:  Genesis and the Planet Destroyer Romulan Ship
A Space Cloud that hinders sensors and communications:  Mutara Nebula and the green cloud that Nemesis takes place
A Death of a major character:  Spock and Data
The Death of the major character saving the lives of everyone else:  Spock gets Warp engines to work, Data destroys the ship that was about to fire.
The possibility that the major character will be resurrected:  Spock doing the mind meld with McCoy, Data doing a memory duplication with B4
A death scene of the villan with some a vengeful line of dialogue:  Khan quotes Moby Dick and Shinzon was happy that Picard and him would die together
Realization of someone that was related to you: Kirk meets David, Picard meets Shinzon

I think there were some other minor things but I can't recall them.  Anyway, after saying all that, I would still recommend this movie for people as some good matinee entertainment.  I liked the battle sequences and the acting, for the most part, was okay.  The wedding sequence didn't work for me (it seemed very forced), Riker leaving to his own command didn't have the emotional impact that I thought it could have, and I was slightly dumbfuddled that no mention of Lore was to be found when B4 was first discovered.

There are many parallels, but I believe that Nemesis stands by itself.  I don't know if there will be any more TNG movies, but this one felt like it was an ending.  The one thing that impressed me was the level of emotion in this film. At first, I felt a sad nastalgia as the characters met for a wedding, then I felt nervous as the characters meet the villain. Next came excitement as the action picked up.  By the end, I was actually squirming in my seat from the tension.  I have never seen a Star Trek movie that has struck my emotions like this.

But the concept of an evil Picard clone was a great idea and there was some good dialogue between the two.
The cast looks great - I can't reveal the ending but it just can't be as it seems - MAKE IT NOT SO!  There are some wonderful shots of the Enterprise and the special effects are terrific.  If you're a fan, you won't miss seeing this one.
I can't help but reveal that Whoopie Goldberg makes a brief appearance as Guinan!

There might have been a time when the command deck of Starship Enterprise looked exciting and futuristic, but these days it looks like a communications center for security guards. Starships rocket at light speeds halfway across the universe, but when they get into battles the effect is roughly the same as on board a World War II bomber. Fearsome death rays strike the Enterprise, and what happens? Sparks fly out from the ceiling and the crew gets bounced around in their seats like passengers on the No. 36 bus. This far in the future they wouldn't have sparks because they wouldn't have electricity, because in a world where you can beam matter--beam it, mind you--from here to there, power obviously no longer lives in the wall and travels through wires.
...
I tried to focus on the actors. Patrick Stewart, as Capt. Picard, is a wonderful actor. I know because I have seen him elsewhere. It is always said of Stewart that his strength as an actor is his ability to deliver bad dialogue with utter conviction. I say it is time to stop encouraging him. Here's an idea: Instead of giving him bad dialogue, why not give him good dialogue, and see what he can do with that? Here is a man who has played Shakespeare.
...
There is a scene in the movie in which one starship rams another one. You would think this would destroy them both, and there are a lot of sparks and everybody has to hold onto their seats, but the ""Star Trek"" world involves physical laws which reflect only the needs of the plot. If one ship rammed another and they were both destroyed and everyone died, and the movie ended with a lot of junk floating around in space, imagine the faces of the people in the audience.
I think it is time for ""Star Trek"" to make a mighty leap forward another 1,000 years into the future, to a time when starships do not look like rides in a 1970s amusement arcade, when aliens do not look like humans with funny foreheads, and when wonder, astonishment and literacy are permitted back into the series. Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy.

I encourage you to check out other reviews Ebert's authored... They're typically really brilliant and add to the entire film experience.",1039996800,,2693,4.493877551020408
1466838,4,B00005JLRT,"First, I have actually seen this movie in theatrical release. This review is not based on film clips from trailers or on speculation or fantasy. Second, I am a huge Star Trek: The Next Generation fan, both the TV series and the movies. Third, I am a great fan of Patrick Stewart. As my rating indicates, this is a very good movie (although I don't think that it is the equal of some of the best episodes in the TV series). And just as importantly, it encompasses the sense of adventure concerning the unknown, the unconquerable optimism of humanity, and the examination of human nature itself that has made the Star Trek franchise so durable.
The cast includes all the major characters from the long running series: Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Data (Brent Spiner, who also plays Data's ""brother""), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Worf (Michael Dorn), Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis), Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and introduces Shinzon (Tom Hardy) and his Reman Viceroy (Ron Perlman).
During preparation for the wedding of Riker and Counselor Troi (yes, at long last), the Enterprise is diverted from its journey to Betazed by unidentified signals from the planet Kolarus III.  They discover that these are emanating from parts of an android including a severed head which is identical in appearance to Data. After a wonderful chase and escape scene they are requested by now Admiral Janeway (Kate Mulgrew in a cameo appearance) to divert their course to Romulus and act as federation ambassadors to the new government. The head of the government is Shinzon, who is a younger clone of Picard. The Romulans had initially planned to secretly attempt to replace Picard with Shinzon in order to subvert the Federation from within; when the plan was abandoned he was exiled to Remus and saved from death by his Viceroy.
Shinzon claims that due to his human heritage but Reman upbringing, as the leader of Romulus he can be the link to broker a peace between the Federation and its enemies. Soon, however an intricate plot is discovered involving Shinzon's attempt to renew his failing health while planning the complete annihilation of earth. While the details are very elaborate, the basic story line becomes the continual struggle of good versus evil. And, of course, the interest is heightened because both Picard and Data engage in detailed introspection and self analysis in order to decide what makes them uniquely who they are and how they should deal with ""their other selves"". As you may guess, while the conclusion is ultimately uplifting as the human spirit and the ingenuity of Picard triumph and the earth and humankind are saved, it is not without considerable cost, including the willing sacrifice and complete annihilation of one of our old friends .
The final battle scene is very long and more in keeping with the action adventure nature and special effects of the movies than of the TV series, but does have some spectacular sequences during the final moments. I enjoyed the movie a great deal, and believe that it compares favorably with most of the other movies in the series. If the current intentions of Paramount to make this the final episode in The Next Generation serires are not altered, this is certainly a fitting way to remember these old friends, but they will be missed.",1039996800,,3340,4.932504440497335

1466840,4,B00005JLRT,"It has been four years since the last Star Trek movie so fans (myself included) have been eagerly awaiting the release of Nemesis.  I'm happy to say the film does not disappoint.  As most fans know, the basic plot involves the Romulan's overture of peace to the Federation.  The Enterprise is dispatched to Romulus at the request of the requisite bad guy Shinzon, played nicely by Tom Hardy.  Suffice it to say Shinzon is not actually Romulan, but has engineered an usurping of the Romulan government as a means to an end for his grand plans.  The premise for his actions is sometimes hard to believe, but Hardy is convincing in the role.  My only complaint about the film is that sometimes the story felt a bit hurried.  At a running time just north of two hours, I guess there was no choice.  The action level of the film has been kicked up a couple of notches.  At times it plays like a Star Wars movie.  While it works for this movie, I would hate to see the future films go down the action road at the expense of plot development.  The epic space battles are nothing short of excellent.  Some fans have criticized the film as being too much like Wrath of Kahn.  Indeed the similarities are there, but is that such a bad thing?  I submit that in this case it is not.  The entire TNG cast is present along with a few cameo appearances, but the spotlight falls on Patrick Stuart and Brent Spiner.  You don't have to be a ""trekkie"" to like Nemesis, but it helps with the nuances of the film.  Still, there is enough action and story development to please even casual Trek fans.  Highly recommended for Star Trek and science fiction fans alike.  Worth the full price of admission.",1039996800,2,1680,4.431372549019608
1466841,3,B00005JLRT,"As an avid Trek fan, of course I had to make the movie! Nemesis is probably the darkest Trek of them all but it could have been better. There were too many holes to allow me to give a full five stars such as: why put Wesley Crusher and Guinan in the wedding scene to never show them again (very brief cameo)? The story lines didn't always transition smoothly; the development of Picard's clone could have been done more effectively; etc.
However, the movie was entertaining, particularly for Trekkies. A few friends went with me that are not Trekkies and they thought it was ""okay"" but nothing earth-shattering.
Go see the movie or get it when it comes out on DVD - I'll certainly add it to my collection.",1039996800,2,705,4.4728682170542635
1466842,3,B00005JLRT,"STAR TREK NEMESIS is the big 1-0 for the Trek movie francise.  Past history would show that the even numbered films are the better of the bunch.  This one is better then the other odd number films of the bunch, but not by much (Hence the title of this review).  The cast wanted some time off so that they could pursue other interests.  Time away hasn't diminshed the casts appeal but something in the movies was lost in the absence as this movie doesn't feel so much of a Star Trek movie but more of some snazzed up sci fi action blast.
  The story does focus on the Romulans, who short of a few appearances in the movies, never got their just due as the villians in a film.  Thats different here.  The Romulans are itching for a conquest of Federation space and a mysterious new Leader has made the promise of an assault under a guise of peace talks with the Federation.  Picard and the Enterprise are sent to Romulus to talk, but it's all a trap.  The crew learns that the leader, Shinzon has constructed a radiaiton weapon which is capable of encompasing any area he wishes, even a planet.  While Picard races home to join the fleet, Shinzon follows to stop him.  What follows is a space battle to beat just about any seen in a Trek show or Feature (Yes it even beats the one seen in movie VI).  Sacrifices are made, The Enterprise takes a tremendous beating, new friends will arive, and some move on.  This will definitly have a change on the course of the Next Generation crew in the future.
  Hey, I made it sound good didn't I?  So why not a better rating then the three stars?  Well it's all about style.  Take for instance when Picard lands on a planet in the ARGO, a nifty Starfleet jeep (First time anything with wheels ever shown in Trek), after finding the pieces of a puzzle, the crew is attacked and chased by other jeeps in what is something that could be seen in almost any other action film.  Also, if you saw FIRST CONTACT, you saw that the ship has an armory for the weapons, here the phasers are revealed from rotating panals in a wall, it reminded me of Batman.  Another minor nuonce is the naming schemes of the enemy vehicles.  A Scorpion Fighter and the Scimatar cruiser aren't very Romulan sounding are they?  Maybe for the Federation they would be.  Finally, the psychic attack that Troi recieves, is more silly then scary, sorry but it was.
  This movie didn't make me challenge my taste for my favorite trek movie like others have.  Maybe if Frakes were put back in charge of directing things will be better in the future (if theres another film, Patrick Stewart has allueded in many interviews that it might not be the last one).  The director here wasn't bad, but Frakes having been a member of the whole francize has a better grasp on the material.  Like I said before, it's not bad, but it certainly didn't measure up to previous Trek movies.  If your a big fan, of course go and see it, a more casual fan should consider waiting for a second run theater or the rental market.",1039996800,,3009,4.38878842676311
1466843,5,B00005JLRT,"The long-awaited tenth film in the Star Trek movie series combines some of the best elements of the previous movies, along with elements of the Star Trek: The Next Generation TV series. If it seems a little too familiar at times, that's really okay with me, because director Stuart Baird offers such a complete vision of everything great Star Trek can provide its viewers.
Reportedly, the studio asked Baird to trim the movie to keep it short enough for multiple showings on each screen. That would explain the extremely brief appearances by some supporting characters. Their roles still work fine, but I hope the DVD will include a restored director's cut. Further, I hope Paramount won't repeat the past gimmick of releasing this Star Trek movie on DVD, then releasing a ""special edition"" or whatever edition after Trek fans already bought or rented the first one. I absolutely hate that, but the other studios practice the same marketing technique.
Back to the movie itself. The actors all give perfect performances, with some of the regular characters showing new sides, or sides they rarely revealed before. The special effects, though frequent, never look like special effects. Everything looks completely real. The action scenes alternate nicely with the emotional ones, keeping the movie from becoming either boring or mindless. In fact, I would call this one of the most emotional and exciting films in the series. I would also call it one of the best.
Now, can Paramount please make a movie or mini-series of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine?",1039996800,,1546,4.996124031007752
1466844,5,B00005JLRT,"I thought that ""Nemesis"" was perhaps the best Star Trek ever made; the story line was well done, the acting was strong, and the graphics were very good. I walked away very pleased with having seen this newest episode, and expect at least one more with all/most of the same members of the cast. I did see some ideas in this story that originated in other SciFi films, so I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't completely new and original, but I was entertained beyond my expectation. This is a must-see... and one that I think will be viewed many times by me, as Star Trek endures in the hearts of SciFi fans everywhere.",1039996800,,620,4.4
1466845,4,B00005JLRT,"It's about friggin' time!  After 20 years and 7 mediocre films in the series, Trek FINALLY delivers the goods!  Undeniably the best of the Next Generation era films and arguable the best one since Khan,  Screenwriter John Logan and Director Stuart Baird are unequivocally the best thing to happen to Trek since Nicholas Meyer was brought into the fold.  The result is an entertaining installment that finally elevates the cast of TNG from the television series and solidifies their position to feature film status.  My biggest complaint of the post-classic Trek films is that they have always come off as 2 hour long episodes of the television series, and not even the best episodes of the show at that.  There have been much better episodes of the series that should have been made into theatrical films like ""All Good Things"" or ""The Best of Both Worlds"".  Until ""Nemesis"" came along, the Berman-era films have failed to distinguish themselves as theatrical contenders.

Although the plot of Nemesis may seem a bit like a ""clone"" of Wrath of Khan, it definitely has the chemistry to make it an enjoyable and entertaining [copy].  For instance, the scene where a crippled Enterprise backs away from the Scimitar to escape the ""Doomsday"" weapon (see Genesis Device), you can practically hear the sinister Shinzon uttering ""No Picard, you can't get away!""  The references to Khan are unmistakable, but scribe John Logan knows his audience and he knows exactly what they want to see and he knows these characters and injects the franchise with the right dosage of action and humor to resuscitate life into the dying franchise and keep the crew of the good ship Enterprise trekkin' a bit longer.

As always, Patrick Stewart delivers a first class performance with Shakespearean benediction no matter how bland the script or dialogue may be.  Here, Picard has truly met his match in the form of a clone of himself.  This clone is younger and more agressive and mirrors his younger self in every flawed detail.  The whole time I kept thinking of the brilliant episode ""Tapestry"" where Q sends Jean-Luc back to change the mistakes of his past and we meet that arrogant and brash younger version.  Here, Shinzon is literally an example of Youth versus Wisdom and the themes are remakably explored between these two diametrical characters.  Khan he is not, but Tom Hardy delivers a diabolical performance as the calculating villain.  I still would like to have seen Shinzon complete the blood transfusion and jump 30 years in age in which we would have seen Patrick Stewart playing opposing roles against himself but perhaps that would have been too much like the classic Trek episode ""The Enemy Within.""

The supporting cast are all present and (somewhat) accounted for.  Gates McFadden is basically ""On Call"" as Dr. Beverly Crusher making the house calls as needed.  As usual, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi serves basically one function, that of a psychic Ouija Board, but her engagement scene to William Riker was befitting.  Levar Burton once again holds the ship together as Chief Engineer Geordi LaForge delivering all of the technobabble and suffering from Scotty Syndrome.  As for the loveable Klingon warrior, Mr. Worf, it seems Michael Dorn is unfairly given the smallest part to play in this film.  During the film's climax, he seems to disappear from sight while Jonathan Frakes' Potsy-looking (see Anson Williams from Happy Days) Riker is manhandling the Reman Viceroy (Ron Pearlman) down a laundry chute while Jean-Luc Picard is fighting with (himself) and the Enterprise is taking a pummeling.  One must assume that either Worf is still too hung over from the Romulan Ale served at Riker and Troi's reception, or that he must be curled up in Ten Forward lounge with a bottle of Saurian Brandy getting drunk with Guinan.  I find it amusing that he only shows up again at the end for the free booze in the Captain's Ready Room during the toast to ""absent friends.""  I'm surprised that they didn't cut back to Worf during the corridor firefight with the Reman thugs.  I would love to have seen him break out the Bat'Leh and take them out in honorable Klingon fashion as it would have provided another element of suspense.

Brent Spiner reprises his role as the charming android Data and once again explores his humanity through the presence of a doppleganger brother in the form of the childlike B4.  This could have been the perfect opportunity to bring back his evil brother Lore had they not written him out on the show.  Perhaps B4 was designed with the intention of giving Spiner an oportunity to explore new facets of his character having reached a redundant impasse with the development of his role Data.

It is a shame that it took them 4 films with this exceptional cast before everything finally clicked on what may be the last film to feature the TNG crew although the door has been left open for possibly another voyage.  If they can continue with this level of dramatic intensity then by all means ""Make It So.""  And if they do decide to make another, I would love to see them bring back John DeLancie as Q.",1039996800,2,5123,4.831615120274914
1466846,2,B00005JLRT,"The curse has been broken. The even-odd rule that said even-numbered Star Trek movies were better than odd-numbered Trek movies has been shattered. This film, the tenth in the long-running sci-fi series, is the only even-numbered outing that doesn't hit the mark.
""Star Trek Nemesis"" (there's no : in the title) looks and feels like a pedestrian action film that somehow found its way into the Trek universe. The spice that made the earlier nine Star Trek movies feel special is gone. The characters we know and love are there, but they're void of zest and personality. Patrick Stewart as the venerable Captain Picard, and the rest of the crew (including Jonathan Frakes as Riker, Brent Spiner as Data and Mirina Sirtis as Troi) are sleep-walking through their parts. There is not one remarkable performance in this film, least of all Tom Hardy as the latest Trek villain, Shinzon.
Like the other Trek films, ""Nemesis"" is silly, but in a bad way. Listen for the way Shinzon's rubber suit squeaks as he walks in it. Notice how the plot lacks any exposition, going straight into the action a-la ""First Contact"", but how oblivious Picard and the others seem to what ought to be staring them in the face. ""Nemesis"" has more plot holes than any other Trek movie, and although the premise is intriguing enough, the script is so patchy that a five-year-old kid could point out the inconsistencies. Also watch the climactic battle scene for the way it liberally borrows from previous Trek films (most notably ""Wrath of Khan"") and blatantly steals elements from the original ""Star Wars"".
It's time for the Star Trek film series to reinvent itself. ""Nemesis"" seems tired, and is the worst Star Trek film to date, thanks largely to the lumbering plot, which seems apocryphal to Trek canon. Producer Rick Berman is the most blatant problem. I've never much liked Berman's style (it's ok for TV; inappropriate for cinema), and it's time for him to finally get the axe (at least as head of Star Trek feature film production) and let the Big Boys handle the next film.
What's happened to Jerry Goldsmith since 1998 (when he scored ""Star Trek: Insurrection"")? The music in this film is deplorable and lackluster, sounding (as it often does on the television series) thin and minimalist. And what's going on with the electronic keyboard-sounding instrument on the soundtrack, which makes a ""buzz-whoosh"" sound at the beginning of every scene in the film? It sounds like a teenager making homemade sound effects with his battery-powered Casio keyboard.
Although ""Nemesis"" had some effective and entertaining moments, especially when Riker fights the Reman soldier, I felt like everything I'd watched amounted to nothing, like the whole film dissolved after it was over. It seemed hollow and unsettled. Unconvincing. Unsatisfying. The sex scene--the first in any Trek film--is cruel. The action scenes are hollow and unremarkable.
Trek movies usually have a certain kind of campy endearment about them, and ""Nemesis"" completely lacks this quality, lacks any sense of fun or excitement. With Berman's producing and Stuart Baird's direction, this film seems like an ordinary action picture set in outer space. The characters don't ring true like they did in ""First Contact"" and even ""Insurrection"". I hope (for Star Trek's sake), they get rid of Berman and hire a real producer for the next movie.",1039996800,7,3376,5.0088967971530245

If Janeway can have a command title above Picard then the federation is dumb enough to be destroyed by one rogue vessel (in reality it was a suicide misson anyway).

The ROM-boy can be a youthful adversary against the old codgers; especially since he is dying faster than the film. And his willingness to expend anothers resource to put on incorruptibility was commom enough

This movie combines the best elements of Star Trek storytelling. It has humor, drama, surprises, cool tie-ins from previous Trek episodes and movies,and a stunning sacrifice. The comraderie between the cast, always good, has never been better. Patrick Stewart leads the way with a comfortable, focused performance that makes you wish they'd start shooting the series all over again. In fact, everyone in the cast does an excellent job. And the special effects and music are spectacular. (Just an aside here: if you're like me and have experienced frustration over the skimpy battle scenes in previous Trek movies, have no fear. Enterprise fights with every ounce of energy she has, and then some.)
The ending, although difficult to bear, contains hope. Nevertheless, be prepared for tears. As Patrick Stewart said in a recent TV Guide interview, this movie simply screams for a sequel (that's a paraphrase), and I hope that happens.
The story is excellently written. Cast members have hinted that if the movie does well, there may yet be another. Please do yourself and the cast a favor: ignore the reviews of critics who don't like Star Trek in the first place. This is a great movie. If it's truly goodbye, they went out with style. But it could be the doorway to bigger and even better things.

1466940,4,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation made names for themselves by bringing speculative fiction to prime-time with a serious, long-running, and engaging series about a multicultural crew in a future where Earth's problems had mostly been solved.  Unfortunately, that formula never translated to the big screen.  The best Star Trek movies (what fans refer to as the ""even-numbers"" - Treks 2, 4, 6, 8, and now 10) are the ones that sidestep serious SF issues in favor of action and camp.  Look at the history: the odd-numbered, SF-oriented Treks involved V'ger, the Genesis Planet, God, and whatever was going on in Generations.  Every one of those films are almost universally reviled by fans. On the other hand, fighting a psycho, visiting the 1980s, making peace with Klingons, and defeating the Borg queen are the Trek movies everyone likes - and the Trek movies centered on action, camp, and outright humor.
Nemesis follows in this splendid tradition by offering the next ""even"" Trek, supposedly the last voyage of the Next Generation crew.  With everyone assembled for Riker's and Troi's wedding, the Enterprise-E picks up a strange signal on a pre-Warp world close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.  Of course, the investigate.  On a pre-Warp world, using the transporter violates the Prime Directive (don't interfere in stuff that ain't yours), but galavanting around in a shiny laser-equipped dune buggy is OK.  Picard gets a moment of pure joy as he tears around an alien desert, picking up parts of what turns out to be a prototype of Data.
No sooner does everyone get back to the ship than Admiral Janeway call Picard on the Interstellar Network, both establishing the nonexistent future of Voyager movies by revealing her new desk job and establishing the plot of the movie by ordering Enterprise to go to Romulus and discuss peace with the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire.  The new Praetor is Shinzon, a Reman.  Until Shinzon assassinated the entire Romulan senate, the Remans were the slaves and whipping boys of the Romulan Empire, a mix of 1920s-era Nosferatu-style vampires and modern, brooding high-school Goths.  Now, the Remans are a force to be reckoned with, because not only do they have an enormous battleship that fires Enterprise-sized torpedoes and has a new kind of radiation designed to wipe out entire planets, but they managed to build it all while they were miners and slaves.  Any race that can accomplish that deserves to rule the galaxy.
But the fun doesn't end there.  It turns out that Shinzon is a clone of Picard, who was at one time going to replace the good Captain. When the Romulans abandoned that project, instead of killing such a politically sensitive creature, they instead sent him to grow up bitter, resentful, and free of morals in a harsh mining environment.  Oops.  At any rate, Shinzon isn't interested in making peace - as if this wasn't obvious by his menacing visage and the sinister music that follows him around.  In fact, he's out to attack the Federation and use his nasty radiation on the unsuspecting inhabitants of Earth - and who better to stop him than Picard and company?
Nemesis follows the even-Trek formula to a T.  Yeah, it's campy, and there are some plot holes large enough to park Shinzon's ship for a little shore leave.  But that's what makes a good Trek movie, and Nemesis is better than average.  The only movie to successfully combine the SF elements of the show and the action of the films was The Undiscovered Country, and Nemesis doesn't come close to that, but for fun value and action sequences, it's right up there with Wrath of Khan and First Contact.  Fans who recognize the limitations of the Trek films should be duly impressed; the fanboys will no doubt pan it and complain.

As for the movie.. well it's got substance. Some of the acting seems forced, especially the Romulans. Picard's nemesis 'Shizone' (sp?) is a good actor, thankfully. His alien friends though seem typical of Trekkie aliens; cannon fodder! Reiker's acting is subpar. But that's okay because the only actors that get any significant amount of screen time are Data, Picard, and Shizone. Everyone else only show up for a few minutes here and there. Picard's acting is spot on. Data is great as well.

For the first twenty minutes the movie seems rushed to setup the stage. Even Captain Janeway appears and suddenly Picard meets his old friend from Voyager (the acting here seems forced), ... The whole stage setup is very forced, but the acting saves it all. Some of the battles with the Romulan vessels and the Scimitar seem forced but do provide some needed action entertainment. It seems that ever since the Enterprise E entered the fleet it's been demolished, smashed up, taken apart. It never seems to be the formidable war machine that is was made to be. The Romulans new ships are bigger than it. Same with Scimitar!

Oh well... The good points of the movie are Picard and Data's acting, as well as Shizone's. Their is excitment that channels the film to it's end. So it is a pretty good film. It's just that a lot of it seems forced. Hopefully we can expect a good Deep Space Nine movie, next time.",1039910400,,1507,4.657894736842105

There are enough big events and big moments in this show to make two good movies.  John Logan said in TV Guide that there is 50 minutes of edited footage that was cut from the movie in order to get it under two hours.  I think the lost 50 minutes hurts the movie.  They should have made two movies with this story or left in some footage.  Let's not forget that Attack of the Clones was nearly two and a half hours long. I did like the movie, and I hope they make another.  Logan and Stuart Baird seem to be a good combination, but I would get another editor.  The action scenes were frequent but seemed over nearly before they began.  On the plus side, the humor in the movie was very natural and was in character. I would rate the movie a solid B.

1466945,4,B00005JLRT,"When I first saw the theatrical trailer for this film, it surprised me greatly; It looked like the ""Star Trek"" equivalent of ""Attack of the Clones"", only with better-looking performances.  However, when I saw the movie (on opening day because I'm a geek..heh), I was a little startled to find that the action that is shown in the commercials and trailers are actually the only action scenes in the film.  This time around, Captain Picard and his gallant crew stand around and talk a lot.
Now, had I known this before I saw the movie, I would not have been so disappointed on opening day, hoping for the Next Generation crew to transport me into a world of intrigue and non-stop excitement.  Instead, we are actually presented with a richer storyline, and some surprisingly strong performances, most notably from Tom Hardy as the evil Shinzon (I think I spelled his name right).  This time around, we are actually presented with multi-dimentional characters as opposed to the rather 2-D, rather boring villains of the previous movie.
Now that what I saw has really had time to sink-into my psyche, I can honestly say that ""Nemesis"" is really one of the better, if not one of the best ""Star Trek"" movies you'll see.  However, this movie does seem to be a bit odd at times, mostly with the editing and pacing of the film.  Even with its grander scale, the movie still races along like a television episode, and the characters seem to be trying to shove as much info and dialogue into a small amount of time, almost as if they're anticipating a commercial break.  This movie is cut to move fast, which seems to work against it, rather than for it.  Longer pauses, stronger beats -- these are what separate film from television, and the filmmakers seemed to be unaware of this...but that's just me ranting as a film student in college, pretending I know what I'm talking about.
All in all, this movie really seems to be a success, finally portraying progress in the lives of the Next Generation crew.  This succeeds in elevating the film to a new level.  It's just a shame that it won't make any money, what with the second Lord of the Rings film being released a week later.  Gee.  Smart move Paramount.  So, go see the movie and hopefully you will be captivated by the Next Generation crew finally being the explorers and adventurers they were long, long ago.",1039910400,2,2356,4.634615384615385

I don't think that the cast or the ship itself have ever looked better. We also get a villian that ranks right below Kahn in substance.
Without giving up the plot I can say that there is a great twist involving Picard and the Remen leader who now rules the Romulan Empire.
The battle scenes in space are the best I've seen in Star Trek.  The ship can finally take more than one or two shots but not too many to be unbelievable.  The manouvering and tactics in the scene have not been seen since Wrath of Kahn.

Accompanying the main plot is a sub-plot, usually less exciting, and mostly dedicated to character building. Nemesis fills in the blanks very well.
  There is enough new Star Trek technologies, character drama, and battles to satisfy your average USA human. But this may not be a good thing. Some trekkies want to see the old Star Trek formula tilt on its axis. Perhaps a story about the Dominion wars, or even the Cardassian conflict; with blood, battle and heroism. This should replentish software trekkies with new technologies and FX. Certainly filling in some of those wide open spaces in the Star Trek time line might satisfy some folks.
  Nemesis is worth your money. But I only gave the film 4 stars. Why? Well, If you ask a software trekkie, Hollywood really has to work hard to make the shows and films with cutting edge special effects. It must be visually spectatular to ""stay par"" with todays' home PC game graphics and mods.
  It was good to see more Romulans, and the Remans, a horrid caste of the Romulan Empire. Nemesis rates somewhere towards ""First Contact"" with respect to the other TNG movies.",1039910400,,1303,4.71806167400881

Well, it didn't disappoint me one bit.  The movie had a good mix of the humor from Insurrection, the darkness from II and VI and all the battle scenes we've come to expect as Star Trek fans.  This movie most likely will not win over any new fans, and for those who don't know a lot about the Star Trek universe, some things may seem strange and not logical.  Well, the movie isn't dealing with Vulcans, and logic isn't a strong point of the Romulans.  This movie does try to make you think about humanity, society, and what is inane, but it doesn't provide a completly fulfilling answer.  Take this movie more on an action basis, don't think too much, have fun with the amazing battle scenes, enjoy the interaction between the characters, cry when so-and-so dies, and enjoy the trip back into the Star Trek universe.

1467034,4,B00005JLRT,"Star Trek Nemesis is number 10 in the Star Trek series, and continues a trend that Star Trek II started twenty years ago, continued by number IV number VI and number VII.  That trend, for those of you who aren't Trekkies like myself, is the Even Phenomenon.  Every Star Trek movie with an even number has been good.
That said, a lot of pressure was on the cast and crew to pump out a good movie, particularily if this is to be the final adventure of Picard and his crew.
And they came through magnificently with Nemesis.
The first half hour is all that stands in the way of this movie recieving five stars, but the corny dialoge ends quickley enough and we are thrust back into the Star Trek Universe aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise once more, and once again we are on a mission to save Earth.
The cast dilivers a stunning performance, the effects give new light to Star Trek warfare, there are plenty of suprises and one pariticular factor that was absent in the last movie returns - humor.
Nemesis is not just a good Star Trek movie, nor just a good science fiction movie, its a good movie period.  The only thing that could ruin this movie is if they make a Star Trek XI.  The ending was a perfect farewell to the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise-E, it may even bring a tear to your eye.",1039824000,,1284,4.3153526970954355
1467035,5,B00005JLRT,"This review isn't just in anticipation on Star Trek: Nemesis, I actually did just go out and see it!  I must say that I'd read an early version of the script nearly a year ago, and thought to myself, ""Oh geez, another one of these stories that has little or no point.""  And when the film was reviewed on Dec. 13, the film's release date, I must say I was inclined to agree with the critics, based on the script I read.  I thought it was going to be another film like Insurrection, kinda neat but with very little relevance to the Star Trek universe.
Well, after actually seeing the final version, I must say I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was blown away!  I'm not going to give away a single thing about the film; I'll just say it was very nicely atmospheric, the performances were outstanding, especially that of Patrick Stewart (Capt. Picard), and the visual effects were enough to leave me sitting in the movie theatre with my mouth hanging open!
The rest of the crew were used more than in the previous two films, to round the cast a bit more this time, and the bad guy, Shinzon, was given some very real depth, which is rare lately in the Star Trek universe, especially for characters who are in a single episode or film.
I will say this about the story, still not giving anything away:  the ending is actually a very pleasant was to end the Next Gen cast story, a bit happy and a bit bittersweet.  Very nicely done.
This film is living proof that you can't always believe the critics, even when they seem to come to a general consensus about a film.  I learned a sore lesson with Nemesis:  make up your own mind about films, and don't believe what the critics say overly much.  If you do, you'll miss a treat of a film",1039824000,,1732,4.320987654320987
1467036,1,B00005JLRT,"The biggest Nemesis here is that Trek has been around so long that is lost steam.  Granted the production value of this film is far greater than Final Frontier, or Generations. Ans it was well-written enough that I wasn't physically cringing in the theater the was I was when I saw Insurrection. However, this film was total bore.  Only go to see it if you are willing to snooze through a slow-moving, aimless feeling movie that produces no excitment, suprises or emotion. It essentially just relies on the usual Trek trick of recycling old Trek plots and plot devices. This film is a total ""clone"" of Star Trek II,  however as we have all learned from science fiction, the clone is never as good as the original.  If you really want to see a good Star Trek film, see Star Trek II, the Wrath of Khan.  This film was just a lame re-make of that awesome flick. I guess the Trek writers have just run out of ideas and are not excited about the franchise anymore.",1039824000,8,959,4.426136363636363
1467037,5,B00005JLRT,"This movie has it all.  Even First Contact, which many believe to be the best TNG movie, only had one short (but very cool) battle between ships.  After that it was all tension within the ship.  This movie is action-packed from beginning to end.  It starts off with heart-warming and appropriately humorous interactions between the regular characters and has some cameos from cast members you don't normally see in the films.  But it gets right down to some intriguing plot developments and some great fights.  The director really gets back to some of the basics of great space battles from Wrath of KahnIf you're a Trek fan, don't miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.",1039824000,8,683,4.745762711864407

I saw the movie the other day and it was not that bad. But this film looks basically much like a two hour star trek special you would see on TV, but that is not a bad thing. But I really hoped that they would make an epical film. Plus if you did not watch the Tv series then you will hate this movie.
CAUTION SPOILERS
One more thing the way this movie ended shocked me. It is worth a look
SPOILERS END
So if you are a Star Trek Fan than you will like this film if you are not a fan then you will hate this film.
Hopes this review helped",1039824000,,621,3.8217054263565893
1467039,3,B00005JLRT,"Okay, there are SPOILERS in this review, though I'm sure all the fanatics know what's going to happen based on the previous reviews.  The promotional campaign seems to indicate that this will be the final 'Next Generation' movie, and events in the movie seem to mark this as the end -- Riker leaves the Enterprise for his own command, and another important character apparently dies (I'll preserve the mystery for those who still don't know), although they leave things open-ended enough for a reunion to occur.  If it is the end (and I can't see them continuing the movie series with 'Voyager', 'Deep Space 9', and certainly not 'Enterprise' characters) it's a rather disappointing one. Like nearly all Star Trek movies since 'The Wrath of Khan', the science fiction element of the show takes a back seat to space battles and action/adventure.  This movie takes that trend to an extreme.  There is very little in the way of plot, and the classic Star Trek sense of adventure, exploration, and reaching out to alien races and ideas is replaced by the 'good guys' shooting ugly aliens. The fight between Riker and a Reman in a Jeffries tube at one point in the movie seems particularly pointless and gratuitous violence, with no real connection to the story. I don't think the script for this movie would ever have even been considered for an episode of the T.V. series.  Basically, this is dumbed-down Star Trek for the masses.  On the positive side, the 'Next Generation' crew still works together well -- the character chemistry is still there, and there are some fun moments shared between the crew.  Fans of Geordi LaForge's character might be disappointed by his limited role in this movie, though.  And if this is the best they can give us after four years or so, maybe it's best that this is the end.",1039824000,12,1807,4.7507987220447285
1467040,2,B00005JLRT,"The central theme of this one seemed to be to strive to be a better man. Picard, at one point, relays this moral lesson to his clone who is bent on destroying the Federation to satisfy his own personal demons. Picard's message should have been directed towards the producers, writer, and director to strive to make a better film. Has Star Trek, I wonder, suffered from severe overkill and attrition with TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, comic books, books, conventions, geeks that dress up in Federation regalla, and not to mention 10 films(the first SIX of which are excellent especially TREK IV-Voyage Home)? The trend of how the even films are superior was broken with this installment. I will continue, however, to rock on with my personal favorite Voyage Home. I was ten years old in 1979 when Star Trek-TMP premiered, and that one actually aged like wine. I think this one will age like vinegar. BRING ON STAR WARS EPISODE III! By the way, the only reason I did not give this one 1 star was that the effects and sound were redeeming enough not to place it in a category with other 1-star failures like Heaven's Gate!",1039737600,2,1120,4.661616161616162
1467041,4,B00005JLRT,"First and formost this is a good entertaining film.  A little above par to most Star Trek films. See it. You're going to have fun, but if you Star Trek fans feel like you've seen it before that's because you have.
Nemisis slavishly follows the Wrath of Khan formula to a degree that boggles the mind.
The similarities are almost too numerous to count, but I'm going to try anyway.
One, self sacrafise of a major character with potential for reincarnation of a sort.
Two,  ship to ship battle in a conveniently placed area of irregular space.
Three, secret communication between captain and crew as he says one thing and does another.
Four, presence of  a planet destroying device.
Five, personal vendetta between captain and villian.
To go on might reveal the story and that's not my intention.
If you think I'm panning this film please see that I gave it 4 stars.
While it lacks the originality and humor of Star Trek 4 and the whimiscal joy of Star Trek 6, it does have the grudge match intensity of Star Trek 2. Which it should, since it has Star Trek 2's plot structure.",1039737600,4,1074,4.525773195876289
1467149,3,B00005JLRT,"I'm a pretty big Star Trek fan going back to the original series and all subsequent TV series and movies.  The way the movies have gone, there are some strong ones like ""Wrath of Kahn"" and some weak ones like the one Shatner directed.  Nemesis is one of the weaker ones, certainly the lesser of the Next Generation movies.  There are some real swell special effects, and some fun scenes, but also some fairly major flaws.
The scene where Picard and Data escape from the enemy ship is great (to describe it would give away part of the story).  The space battle scenes are relatively cool -- although perhaps too much shield status reporting.  (""The dorsal shield is at 30 percent!""  ""The starboard shield is down to ten percent!"" et al)  The threat to the Earth is never fully explained -- exactly why does the villain want to destroy the Earth?  And the villain himself is poorly developed -- his relationship to Picard never really feels right.
I'm definitely glad I saw this film, but it never really ""engaged"" me.",1039737600,,1016,4.605555555555555
1467150,3,B00005JLRT,"After the lacking ""Insurrection,"" fans would wait an abnormally long four years before the tenth installment came to be.  With Rick Berman still producing, he would select John Logan, acclaimed screenwriter of ""Gladiator"" (and Brent Spiner's friend), to write the screenplay which would feature the Romulans as the adversary.  However, due to the debacle in the previous film, Jonathan Frakes declined to direct.  In his place would be Stuart Baird, veteran editor of many films and director of ""Executive Decision"" and ""U.S. Marshals.""
Would this be the film that fans waited so long for?  My personal opinion is rather mixed.  John Logan's script certainly has a lot of heart (in fact, some of the best scenes from his script were edited out for time constraints).  The major problem for me was the ending.  Data's death was rather unemotional and uninteresting.  It even paled in comparison to Captain Kirk's death in ""Generations,"" and THAT was a poor way for a character to go out.  Also, I felt the goodbye scene between Picard and Riker was unemotional as well.  These guys have known each other for over 15 years and all they do is say ""It's been a pleasure serving with you.""  Nothing else.
I really do think they should've chosen a different director.  I was never a fan of Stuart Baird's style of directing.  Nicholas Meyer, Jonathan Frakes, Leonard Nimoy, even David Carson could've directed this with a little more flair.  Baird directs it as an action film, nothing more.
On the plus side, the humor and camaradarie between the characters is well done.  Lots of people complained about bad dialogue but I really didn't think the majority of it was.  The acting was also quite good (especially Ron Perlman as the Viceroy, he is the man!).  There's a real sense of ""old Trekness"" that this film possesses.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is also good (although he could've made it a little better).  It resembles ""Logan's Run"" and other older sci-fi films.
Overall, this film is a definite mixed package.  Since this might be the last Trek TNG film, I felt like the makers and cast didn't take a chance in making this great.  Baird is an action director, nothing more.  Goldsmith produced no new musical themes.  The Romulans are never really explored here.  And finally, Data's death didn't make a definite impact (even less so because of B4, the android double).  All in all, not a terrible film... it's just not great.  I do place it higher than ""Generations"" and ""Insurrection,"" though.",1039737600,,2495,4.866983372921615

received by the mainstream. I don't have  a perspective on that. I felt that the plot, the acting and the special FX were all very well done. The only possible negative for me is that there were some similiar plot devices as STII ""The Wrath  Of Khan"". Of course there have been so many stories told it's difficult to create situations of danger that do not have some duplication. I stayed away from spoilers and was surprised at the end. Very emotional family feeling to it.

Tom Hardy put in an astounding performance as Shinzon and the space battle between the Enterprise and Shinzon's ship was adrenaline-pumping to say the least. The suspence is great. There is plenty of action and the special effects do not dissapoint. There are also powerful emotions in the film which has not really been seen much since Star Trek: Generations. The death of Data was truly painful to watch much like Spock's death in Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan.

1467156,5,B00005JLRT,"This is billed as being the final journey of the Next Generation crew, and it definitely IS the final journey for one of them.  Any time a major character dies, you have to wonder about how they're going to bring them back, but this character's death isn't a ""Mr. Spock"" kind of death...it's definitely a ""Captain Kirk"" dead-and-gone way to do it.  While I hate to see a character develop for 15 years and then be wiped clean in an instant, in this case the character's death makes sense, and they go out in the most heroic manner I've seen through any of the films or tv shows.  It's hard to believe the new crew is gone, but I guess the Paramount folks figured it was best to give these folks a rest and move on to their other two major ST franchises of Voyager and DS9.  Maybe for the next film we can see the remaining characters of all 3 series (Enterprise just doesn't count) get together to find Sisko or something.  Yes, this movie has it's cameos from Wesley Crusher (non-speaking, thank goodness) and Guinan too just for good measure.  And it's good to see Ryker finally taking a ship of his own (I didn't give anything away - that's revealed in the first 5 minutes of the movie).  The villian in this one is so subdued with that inner smoldering anger that he's almost comatose.  He definitely ain't no Khan, that's for sure.  I highly recommend this movie though and I eagerly await the next one in the series!  Way to go guys, and goodbye ______ (I'm not going to give it away).",1039737600,,1491,4.369565217391305
