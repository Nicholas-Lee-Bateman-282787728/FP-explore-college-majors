3035353,3,B000YV2184,"Eventually, this is a story of generational exchange as following a then-young-lovely-joking husband, an England's cabaret artist came Down Under just to divorce and grow up two sons, a semi-spastic younger and baby-faced twenty-year-old truckie shy and knowing nothing in bedroom activities his girlfriend pushed persistently him in.

Perhaps, produced in a last year of a Howard era, this comedy is a copy-cat of the ""family values"" movies of the fifties (Tim, for instance), during a last decade Australia had artificially been pressed in, as explicit sex scenes resulted in a happy wedding finally, where a same gender couple dances joyfully.

8234096,5,B000YV2184,"Very heartwarming movie about the relationship between mother and son, and of course a new lover into his life. A great film for those who can relate to those parents that can be somewhat controlling.",1508630400,,200,4.742857142857143

8234101,5,B000YV2184,I happened to see a movie some time back that introduced me to Brenda Blethyn. She is a joy to watch and I have enjoyed everything I've seen her in since.,1378425600,2,154,4.0

Then you stop ... and discover that you have landed in a story that grabs you heart, reminds you of something in your life , or someone you've known.. In any case you stay, you watch, then you start looking for when it will be on again.. Then when you miss it for a while.. you want a copy.. and you find it on Amazon... And the rest is history, or so they say...",1367193600,2,447,4.090909090909091

8234104,5,B000YV2184,"considering the awful state of american movies today (compared to the explosion of thought-provoking, culture-changing films of the '70s and '80s), thank goodness countries like england and australia still insist on making unique, frightfully well-acted, all-around terrific movies, probably on the same budget hollywood studios use for tom cruise's doughnuts on set. movies like this, and stunners like 'secrets and lies,' 'the last executioner,' 'strange bedfellows'(the hilarious predecessor to adam sandler's flop 'i now pronounce you chuck and larry'), 'ladies in lavender,'and too many more to list now, make movie watching a pleasure again.",1248048000,5,647,5.8936170212765955
8234105,5,B000YV2184,"This funny, touching and thought provoking film is an Australian coming of age film, which surely is one of the best independent films of the past year. When one thinks of a coming of age movie, it typically involves an angst ridden teen, and while the excellent Khan Chittenden plays that role, it is Jean Dwight, portrayed by Academy Award nominee Brenda Blethyn, who truly comes of age. Emma Booth is a revelation, and the earnest and authentic Richard Wilson completes the ensemble cast.

Brenda Blethyn turns in a bravura performance, as a stand up comedienne and single mother, struggling to balance her desire for the footlights with one foot firmly planted in smothering her children's maturation. After seeing this film, and laughing and crying, I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Australian or British tragicomedies.",1216944000,3,840,5.086956521739131
