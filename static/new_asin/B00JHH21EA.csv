8651008,4,B00JHH21EA,"Just got this today. I'm not going to rehash the content of the films, I'm just going to write about the the aspects of the set I was concerned about. Here's the low-down on this set, and it's a mixed bag;
This is a Shout Factory/Timeless Media bargain-priced reissue of
previously released MGM titles; Attack, Attack On the Iron Coast, and Beach Red. All three films are squeezed onto a
single disc and they are not remastered, so there are some minor compression issues and artifacts, but
they all quite watchable. Attack is listed as 1.66:1 anamorphic. Beach
Red is 1.85:1 anamorphic. Attack On The Iron Coast is curiously listed
as ""Fullscreen Letterbox,"" 1.78:1, but is non-anamorphic. This set
really cries out for a blu-ray set where all the films can get proper
treatment. Kind of ridiculous to release Attack On The Iron Coast in a
non-anamorphic transfer. I paid $7.99 for this, so I'd have to say you
can't really go wrong for the price.",1494028800,2,948,4.716867469879518

8651010,4,B00JHH21EA,"I wanted to get the film ""Attack"".... It has an old family friend, Steven Geray, acting in a brief part in the film. (He played roles in many movies and TV series.  The other two movies were a bonus, all 3 of them were good.",1464134400,2,224,3.977777777777778

8651013,2,B00JHH21EA,"This review is format only as I have not watched the films. All three are available alone. They are all sub-titled or closed captioned or both  and sell for a total currently of $59.00 . When this triple combination became available in June for an August release @ only $9.00 I thought ""what a bargain"" and bought it. It came as promised and sat in my 200+ W.W.II collection until yesterday  when I tore it open, put it in the player and discovered not one of these movies is sub-titled or closed captioned! Getting stuck for $9.00 is a minor problem. The uselessness of this DVD is not. Can anyone explain MGM's logic in releasing an anti-hearing impaired product when the captioning has been done and is in the marketplace. Disgusting.",1416441600,6,737,4.6183206106870225
8651014,4,B00JHH21EA,"Good video quality.  Interesting plots all around, with good actors and plots, if a bit depressing.",1415664000,5,99,5.1875
