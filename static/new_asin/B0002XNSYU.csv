2136994,4,B0002XNSYU,"Giovanna is married with two children and having a hard time getting by. Her husband is in a low-paying job, the two seem to always agrue, and the love in their life doesn't seem as strong as it once was. Giovanna i fact finds herself at night spying on their neighbor, Filippo. It is a formof escape, and while, perhaps we are not entirely sure if she would ever cheat on her husband, we can still the problems she faces.

 ""Facing Windows"" is directed by Ferzan Ozpetek (""Turkish Baths"", ""Harem Suare""), written by Ozpetek and Gianni Romoli, and was the winner of five David di Donatello Awards (Italy's Oscar) including ""Best Picture"", ""Best Actor (Massimo Girotti) and ""Best Actress"" (Giovanna Mezzogiorno).

 I saw this film back when it first opened in theaters some months ago, but Amazon didn't have it. Since that time I have been praising the film to anyone who will listen to me. It is so far one of the year's best films. And it has turne out to be a pretty good year at the movies.

 ""Facing Windows"" to some might seem like a comedy\romance version of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"". But I don't think Ozpetek is out to make a Hitchcockian film. The movie brims with passion. It is one of those movies that just manages to carry you away with its charm.

 But there is more to the film than I an leading you to believe. There is a dark side to the story. Massimo Girotti (Best known in Visconti's ""Ossessione"") plays ""Simone"", an old man who seems to have lost his memory. Soon he starts to get flashbacks to a haunting past. And a love that never was.

 To me it is Giovanna Mezzogiorno who keeps the film going. She is a pleasure to watch. ""Facing Windows"" will prove to be a good time to those who enjoy foreign films and light romance films. I have not forgotten about this film since I first saw it, hopefully the film will have the same effect on others.

 Bottom-line: Wonderful blend of good old-fashion romance, and a darker drama. The romance part keeps our attention and Mezzogiorno is a delight. So far one of the year's best films. I loved it.",1094342400,6,2065,4.477333333333333
2136995,5,B0002XNSYU,"The trailer can be misleading, but none-the-less, it is a beautifully shot film and compelling story of love, desire and a bit of mystery.  Not so much about cooking...

The story slowly unfolds, revealing more than expected.  An amnesiac elderly gentleman is found on the streets of Rome and brought into a young and slightly chaotic household (but typical from my experience).  The wife's lost direction becomes more frustrating with the arrival of the amnesiac.  Soon the search is on for his identity, causing her to eventually realize her potential.

Thrown into the mix is her helpless husband and an admiring neighbor who has seen her through the kitchen window.

The hidden love story here, in my opinion, is not about the wife, husband or neighbor, but rather the old man who still feels the love he felt when he was young.

I saw this film in a theatre, and was so immersed that it took me several hours to come back to reality.  View with an open mind from the start.

The soundtrack is completely mesmerizing.  The CD is hard to find, so listen carefully to the beautiful music while watching. Search for the Italian title on the CD.",1093910400,5,1145,4.675
2136996,5,B0002XNSYU,"""Facing Windows"" (La Finestra Di Fronte) is about the mis-connections, the social and personal things that keep us apart, keep us from loving how and whom we really want and doing what we really want to do.

Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) is living a life that she doesn't want: she loves her children and her job pays well but her husband Filippo is irresponsible; jumping from one job to the next: he's the proverbial child-man never accepting responsibility for his actions.

One night when Giovanna and Filippo are out for the evening they come upon an old man, obviously not a bum, who is disoriented and speaking of things long gone by. Over Giovanna's objections, Filippo takes the man Davide (Massimo Girotti) home with them. However grudgingly she does, Giovanna comes to realize, through the course of the film, that it is fate and good luck really that has brought she and Davide together. And more to the point it is Davide who snaps Giovanna out of her self-imposed ennui by telling her: ""Your problem is that you've turned your passion (making pastry) into a hobby when it should have been the foremost thing in your life.""

""Facing Windows"" operates on several levels: as a detective story, as a love story and as a story of family and of marriage. But more importantly, it is about Giovanna waking up and realizing her potential and her dreams of fulfilling it; things like many of us, she has squandered and suppressed for a thousand ""good"" reasons.",1093478400,11,1467,4.790513833992095

2137018,5,B0002XNSYU,"Facing Windows is a classic, the essence of modern Italian filmmaking by Italy's premier director Franz Ozpetek.  Of course, you expect everything he does to be superb.  And this is a superb production. The characters, the plot, the scenery, the dialogue are outstanding.

2137020,5,B0002XNSYU,"The most ""Liked"" of the reviews here on Amazon says it all.  This is a beautiful movie.  It is beautifully set, the people are beautiful, the stories (story within a story within a story) are beautifully told.

I'm not going to repeat telling you what the film is about, I'm just going to tell you that you will like this movie.  And you will get to learn some key Italian phrases. ;-)

The movie has food (baking) and have you ever seen a bad movie that has food as one of the stars?

I will leave you with the advice the elderly gentleman gives Giovnanna:

You still have a choice,
You can change, Giovanna,
Don't be content to merely survive.
You must demand ... to live in a better world -- not just dream about it.",1376265600,2,719,4.242647058823529

2137022,4,B0002XNSYU,"Davide is a man lost in the streets of the Roman ghetto searching for a lost love. Giovanna is lost in her marriage searching for the love of life. These two characters meet and tell a story where, in my opnion, the message, without turning the movie into after school special, is ""live; don't just exist"" and stop making everybody a priority when, obviously, you're not their priority. I liked how the film is a mixed of suspense and drama without being pretentious or over the top.

Facing Windows is a film about the decisions we make in life, about living and not wonder what would've happened. This is the fifth film I watch by Ferzan zpetek and, after ""Mine Vaganti"" (2010) and ""Magnifica Presenza"" (2012), the third of his films that I like. I have watched many films starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and, except for the Oscar nominee ""La Bestia Nel Cuore"" (2006), she seldom disappoints.",1362873600,,892,4.717948717948718

2137024,3,B0002XNSYU,"""Facing Windows"" (La Finestra di Fronte) (2004).  In this 107 minute, full color contemporary Italian romantic drama, directed by Verzan Ozpetek, we find Giovanna, (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a Roman housewife and mother, stuck in a dull marriage, to a man who loses his jobs often; a dull job, at a chicken packing factory, and a dull and hopeless feeling life.  But she finds some interest in Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), the handsome, well-built man who lives across from her, and whose window faces hers.  And she, surprisingly, begins to rebuild her life by learning to care for Simone AKA Davide Veroli, the internationally-famed fine baker and senile Jewish Holocaust survivor who has wandered into it one day.

Simone appears to be obsessed by the long-ago happenings of Autumn, 1943, the waning days of World War II, when Rome was occupied by the Germans and the lives of many Jews were in danger.  But, as played by the veteran actor Massimo Girotti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Art-of-Love/dp/B002LFPAOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Art of Love</a>), he functions as the heart of the movie, and has many life lessons to teach Giovanna, not least in the areas of love - and fine baking.  The film is dedicated to Girotti, who died shortly after its completion; before casting him, director Ozpetek.(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steam-The-Turkish-Bath/dp/B005P2BLC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steam - The Turkish Bath</a>), considered casting the better-known Jean Rochefort(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Bean-s-Holiday/dp/B003ZSHLT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Bean's Holiday</a>), and Serge Reggiani (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casque-d-Or-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0006HC0GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casque d'Or (The Criterion Collection)</a>) for the role.

The movie was filmed on location in Rome, and shows it as the lively bustling cosmopolitan city it is today.  The Holocaust theme, which is at the core of the movie, is an original, powerful, graceful and moving one that I've not seen or read of before.  But, apparently, the film makers didn't trust it to carry the film, and so chose to utilize a flashback and frame structure to tell their story.  And, unfortunately, the contemporary romance that frames the evocative wartime romance is predictable.  We've seen it, many's the time.  Worth seeing, for those who care about the subject matter.",1336780800,,2537,6.364431486880466
2137025,5,B0002XNSYU,This film is a perfect example of a masterful portrayal of the lives of ordinary people.  It conveys the emotions and struggles that the characters went through so beautifully.  It also showed the choices we make can affect the rest of our lives.  I love that the story had a happy ending.  Everything worked out in the end and it was poignant.  The acting was superb.  I really enjoyed this movie.,1288656000,,398,4.535211267605634
2137026,3,B0002XNSYU,"A haunting film on memory, love and loss. Giovanna Mezzogiorno humanizes this film.  Massimo Girotti offers a mesmerizing final performance.  Don't dismiss your dreams ~ Demand them!",1280880000,,182,5.703703703703703
2137037,3,B0002XNSYU,"I purchased this because I loved Giovanna Mezzogiorno in The Last Kiss. She totally nailed that role and made me forget that she was an actress. That's how good she was.

I'm not loving her performance here, but putting that aside, the overall movie wasn't too bad. I like how baking was used as a metaphor to her outlook in life. The film may seem a bit random and disoriented at first, but everything is related to one another. The letter in the amnesiac man's pocket, for example, is describing more than the relationship between him and his lover. It also describes Giovanna's relationship with Lorenzo.

Spoiler:
I think things could have worked out better for Giovanna, though, if she had took Emine's advice about sleeping with Lorenzo. I think the fact that she didn't sleep with him made her continue to live in the fantastical, idealistic image of having an ""exciting"" extramarital affair. I feel sorry for her husband. As attractive as Lorenzo is, I'd be asking myself why a financially secure, good-looking man is still single. Maybe because he spends his time spying on neighboring married women.",1270944000,5,1109,4.862433862433862
2137038,5,B0002XNSYU,"I liked this Italian movie directed by Verzan Ozpetak so much that I saw it a second time a few days after I first watched it. You miss the surprises as the plot unwinds with the action going from 1943 to the present and then with flashbacks to the earlier time. On the other hand, you get to see how the whole film fits together as it all makes more sense the second time you see it. All four principal actors-- Massimo Girotte, Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Flippo Nigro and Raoul Bova-- give really memorable performances. Giovanna Mezzogiorno as Giovnna, a prettier Jody Foster, is in a marriage that has gotten a bit stagnant with her husband  Flippo played by Flippo Nigro, who works the night shift and cannot seem to get ahead financially. She works in a chicken plant but has dreams of being a pastry chef as she bakes for the local pub to earn extra money for their struggling family. Raoul Bova as Lorenzo is the handsome man whom she watches in his apartment at her window at night. Flippo and Giovanna's lives are changed when an older man Simone (Massimo Girotti) who is suffering from memory loss and whom they befriend comes into their lives and home. There is not a bad character of the four. They are all ultimately decent and sympathetic. You will care for them tremendously. Simone's story is both sad but life affirming as he instructs Giovanna in the delicate art of pastry making and gives her sage advice the he has learned from his own tragic past. She should do more than just exist and follow her dreams.

This is one of those films that you should not know too much about before you see it or the events will be spoiled for you. The movie, however, makes a powerful statement about the longevity of love and following one's dreams in order to have a full, richer existence. Parts of it will break your heart but you will be glad you saw it.",1238716800,,1860,4.4676470588235295

From beautiful faces, to mysteries of plot, to the sweetly understated ending, I found this film to be quietly heroic.  What a shame that the manufacturer has discontinued production of this DVD.

2137044,3,B0002XNSYU,"'Facing Windows' had a lot of promise and, in general, is a pleasant enough viewing.  But the early reviewer who I think has it spot-on is the one who says ""Turkish-born director Ferzan Ozpetek...often loses his way."" Exactly.  That encapsulates the issue.  Some here have praised this film's ""multiple levels,"" but I think instead it's a lack of focus - it is, by turn, a portrait of a marriage, a detective story, and a story of new love.  I don't see a dexterous intermingling of these threads; instead, it appears Ozpetek has trouble committing to one theme or another.

That said, I do recommend seeing the film.  The beautiful Giovanna Mezzogiorno is a talented actress.  And the core tale involving mystery man 'Simone' - of his heroic actions towards the end of WWII and his love that dare not speak its name - is the film's most intriguing and well executed thread.",1187827200,5,874,4.7105263157894735

2137046,5,B0002XNSYU,"Admirable and ambitious movie, that recreates the life and times of woman trapped by the boredom of the quotidian, married with a conformist man; who will experience a sudden but powerful turning point with a man of dark past and loved by a shy peeping tom journalist who lives in front of her home, and spies her day by day.

This woman will experience and finally will understand the meaning of the existence, when she notices the awful truth that underlies beneath the painful experience of this old man; whose origins are in the middle of the WW2.

A movie who immediately connects us with that classic film of Ettore Scola ""A special day"" and ""The rear window"", where the bitter existential solitude of a unsatisfied woman will find out its real significance, when she knows, exudes and breathes, the awesome dragons that still nestle in the human soul.

2137067,4,B0002XNSYU,"First, I must say that I found FACING WINDOWS (or ""La Finestra di fronte"") deeply affecting. It combines elements of history, suspense, romance, and sentimentality in a very polished and effective fashion. In fact, because of its sentimental heart, I would say that the film is quintessentially Italian, except the writer/director Ferzan Ozpetek is Turkish.

I appreciated the layers of storyline that Ozpetek created, and the film has such a lush sheen, it makes lower-middle class Italian life look pretty good. In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much, here's how far I have to stoop to find something to criticize:

Why do marketers insist on giving movies asinine taglines? In this film's case it is: ""Desire has no bounds."" This is so stupid, it would have put me off the movie had I been aware of it beforehand. (End of needless tirade.)

Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) lives a good though dull life of husband (Fillipo, played by Filippo Nigro), children and a job she dislikes. Giovanna is actually quite mean to and unforgiving of her loving husband, Filippo who obviously adores her but has a hard time pleasing her on all fronts. One day a confused older gentleman, Simone (Massimo Girotti) stumbles into Giovanna and Filippo and inadvertently changes their lives.
Ozpetek exhibits a deep understanding and sympathy for his characters and this humanity shines through every frame of this film. Windows work two ways: they allow you to look out at the world but conversely windows also allow the world to observe you.",1148688000,,1092,5.2457142857142856
2137069,5,B0002XNSYU,"This is the best film I've seen in perhaps six months or more.  The direction by Turkish/Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is consistently interesting, intriguing, beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually.  The film is beautifully cut, and the acting, particularly by the fascinating Giovanna Mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also Giovanna, is first rate.

The story begins in a bakery during World War II when Davide Veroli (Massimo Girotti) is a baker's apprentice.  We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment.  But he is pounced upon by the baker.  They wrestle, a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on Davide's hands as he runs out into the streets.

Cut to modern times as Giovanna and her working-class husband, Filippo (Filippo Nigro) are crossing a bridge in the city.  They meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented.  He can't remember his name and he has no identification.  Filippo takes pity on him and against his wife's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment.  We know because of the man's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from World War II.

But his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about Giovanna's brief affair with the man next door, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whose apartment window faces hers.  This is a love story, a bitter-sweet one--which all great love stories should be in some sense, since life itself is bittersweet.  It is framed by, and contrasted with, another love story, that involving the older man from many years ago.

The tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married Giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city.  Will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man?  Because the police can find out nothing about the old man, and because Giovanna's heart softens toward him, and because he is an elegant man of refinement, especially in the pastry arts--Giovanna's dream is to be a pastry chef--the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship, the old man and the young woman.

That's enough of the plot--the development, the denouement, and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense.  Instead let me say that the feel of modern Italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present.  The dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films.  This is the first film directed by Ozpetek that I have seen, but it won't be the last.

But see this for Giovanna Mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen.",1134518400,4,3023,4.729007633587786

2137071,4,B0002XNSYU,"After watching the movie you'll wonder if it was the simplicity of the movie or the overwhelming charm and beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno that captivated your attention. I guess it is a combination of both (however, I am tempted to give more marks to the sparkling beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno).

Giovanna and her husband run into an octogenarian (played by Massimo Girotti) suffering from partial amnesia on the streets of Rome. Reluctant to leave him alone, they bring him home for the night. He doesn't speak much, but after some coaxing by Giovanna's kids, he reveals his name as Simone. For some inexplicable reason Giovanna's husband does not take Simone to the police and Simone lands up staying with their family for a few days. In the mean time relationship between Giovanna and her husband gets strained and in a trite twist, Giovanna gets attracted towards a smart looking man living across the street (and has facing windows).

Simone's memory relapse continues and he mysteriously wanders into old city, knocking on the doors of an old shop (Simone has a number etched on his forearm, which is a tell-tale insignia of a Nazi prisoner). One day, Simone goes missing and Giovanna embarks on a mini investigation to track him down. She manages to locate him. Simone is actually a very well-off ex-baker (and also a queer) who had rescued many prisoners from the Nazis. Simone teaches Giovanna some trade secrets of baking excellent cakes/pastries and indirectly advices her to avoid succumbing to temptations of an extra-marital fling with the neighbor. Giovanna overcomes her temptations, starts her life anew by starting her own bakery and accepting her husband again.

The story is very simple, but the execution is wonderful. Watch it ... you won't be disappointed.",1120608000,6,1781,5.030508474576271
2137072,5,B0002XNSYU,"Windows have often have a symbolic value that some connect with looking towards the future, curiosity, opportunities, hope, and much more.  This means that the title Facing Windows could suggest a number of different allegorical interpretations, which is for the audience's own analysis.  Nonetheless, the title also proposes that a person who is looking through the window must take initiative by facing the window, or a symbolic interpretation would be futile.  The Italian film Facing Window presents a visual experience that plays with the notion of dreaming and taking the initiative when opportunity presents itself.

On the way home, Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) and her husband Filippo (Filippo Nigro) come across an old disoriented man who wants to give Filippo some money.  Sympathetically Giovanna expresses that the man should put the money away and she tells her husband to leave the man alone.  Despite Giovanna's plead to leave the man alone Filippo insists on helping the man, as they bring him to their home.  Under Giovanna's protest, her husband lets the man stay at their home overnight without consideration of the children at home.  The following day Filippo promises to bring the old man, who they learn goes by the name Simone, to the police station, but to Giovanna's irritation, the old man is still at home when she returns from work.  However, there is the second scene in the film while the initial scene will make more sense after the end credits.

During the stay, Simone sits and observes the family, as if he is trying to recognize something.  On one occasion, he watches Giovanna bake some pastries while giving her some good pointers.  This is the first time she makes a connection with Simone who she is supposed to bring to the police station after she has sold her pastries at a local bar.  She leaves Simone in the car while dropping off the pastries when her neighbor Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whom she has been secretively studying from her window, informs her that the Simone has wandered off.  With the help of Lorenzo, she finds him, but she is more interested in Lorenzo.  Her connection with Lorenzo explores another more figurative meaning of what windows can produce through voyeurism, which is something Hitchcock dwelled over in Rear Window (1954).

Instead of bringing Simone to the police station she brings him back home, which is Giovanna's first initiative that will affect her future.  She learns that Simone is a survivor of a concentration camp, as he has tattooed numbers on his forearm and she wants to help find someone who knows him.  Simultaneously, Lorenzo intrigues her while her friend encourages her on to have an affair with him.  Her marriage with Filippo also seems to hit rock bottom, as her husband is nothing like Lorenzo.  On top of this, she has to take care of two children and work at a poultry factory as an accountant due to her husband's inability to keep a job, which has hampered her from pursuing her dream of being a pastry chef.  Despite all her obstacles, Simone will help put things in perspective, as he becomes the catalyst that ushers her over the hurdles that obstruct her full potential.

Facing Windows displays several symbolic ideas through terrific mise-en-scene and cinematography that visually suggest hope, opportunity, and dreams.  In addition, the cast performs with genuine emotions that brings out the individuality in each character.  All of these intangibles are tied together in a fantastic script that cleverly produces authentic highs and lows.  Through the ride in between these highs and lows the audience will find a captivating story that offers both contemplation and drama at a very high caliber.",1118880000,6,3709,5.001628664495114

There lives a handsome man who eventually ends up becoming the incarnation of Giovanna's unfulfilled dreams, those she had to give up in order to ""grow up"". She wanted to be a pastry chef, and instead ended up becoming a supervisor in a fabric. Now, she just bakes some cakes in order to make some extra money: her passion has turned into a hobby.

Everything changes when an unknown quantity enters the scene. While walking in the street, Giovanna and Filippo meet an elegantly dressed old man (Massimo Girotti), who seems to have lost his memory. Giovanna feels pity for him, but not enough to do something to help him. Filippo, on the other hand, talks Giovanna into allowing the old man to sleep in their house at least for one night, until the police can discover who he is.

The couple has two kids, who immediately like their new ""guest"". That one night becomes more time, and as Giovanna discovers new things about the old man, she starts to like him more. He remembers his name, Simone, but not much else. Despite that, he knows that he can cook quite well, and even gives some cooking tips to Giovanna.

Thanks to ""Simone"", Giovanna will also meet the man of the facing window, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), and join him in a quest to discover who Simone is. They only know that the old man has some numbers tattoed on his skin, showing that he was in a concentration camp during World War two. Another clue is a beautiful love letter, that gives Giovanna and Lorenzo a big surprise, and a good lead.

In a way, Simone allows Giovanna to see her life from another perspective, and to realize that her dreams can become a reality. As he says, ""Io non posso fare pi niente ormai. Lei invece pu ancora cambiare, Giovanna. Non si accontenti  di soppravvivere. Lei deve pretendere di vivere in un mondo megliore, non soltanto sognarlo"" (loosely translated, ""I cannot do anything anymore. You can still change, Giovanna. Don't be content to merely survive. You must aspire to live in a better world, not only dream about it"")

But what ultimately Giovanna has to ask herself is what she really wants, above all. ""Facing windows"" is a film about choices, and life, marriage and routine, reality and dreams. It tackles difficult subjects, for example infidelity and homosexuality, and has some scenes that are not apt for minors. But mostly, it is a film you probably would like to see.

Of course, ""Facing windows"" has its faults. For example, the ending didn't make me completely happy, but all the same I think that this movie is excellent. While I was watching it in my dvd player, I remember reviewing some scenes I liked quite a few times, and thinking how great it was to be watching the movie at home and not in the cinema, in order to be able to do just that. When something like that happens, you just know you have found a movie worth watching and recommending  :)

2137074,5,B0002XNSYU,"The opening scenes of a bakery and the violence that ensues draws you into a tangled tale of lust and survival. Not only does the director deal with difficult decisions, he seeks to draw on your sympathy for all humans caught in the clutches of love.

As a young man runs from a bakery in fear of his life, a bloody handprint starts to fade into the future. We are taken into the present day as a woman and her husband walk home, arguing about life and seemingly insurmountable problems. Instantly you can recognize Giovanna's desire to be protected, loved and desired. She is unfulfilled and seeking adventure. To be honest, she is ripe for an affair mostly because her husband is not meeting her needs and seems to be lost in his own world of employment hell.

Suddenly she is talking to the sidewalk, because Filippo is talking to an elderly gentleman (Davide) who is suffering memory loss. After taking him to the police station, they all end up back and the noisy apartment complex where people hang their clothing out the window. It is all so romantic.

Then, we notice the facing windows. This becomes a focal point throughout the movie and is where most of the action occurs. Giovanna distrusts her husband's ability to look after the family, but it actually turns out she distrust herself and must meet Davide who will lead her to her destiny. He shows her how to transform her hobby into her life.

The entire plot seems centered around choices people make to survive emotionally and physically. We see flashbacks of Davide's life and he also has many hallucinations due to his past experiences.

The eyes in this movie are especially revealing. The director focuses on the eyes in many instances and the results are almost a terrifying intensity that I've never seen in any movie. The actors convey their emotions so well, it was stunning. There is one scene where Filippo is feeling his life is completely inadequate and the look on his face almost made me cry because you could imagine a man feeling that inadequate and desperate to not only please his woman, but provide for his family.

The cooking is especially wonderful and kitchen scenes and chocolate cakes dripping with dark chocolate icing are delicious moments in the movie.

In the end, we can see this is a movie about two individuals trapped by circumstance and overwhelming choices. Do they make the right choices in the end? Oh, the torment...and the beauty. I watched this four times in two days because this movie will take hold of your heart and I loved the kitchen scenes and Giovanna lurking about in her dark kitchen looking into a life she wanted to live.

2137088,3,B0002XNSYU,"I rented this film because it featured Italian actor Raoul Bova, who was in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", yet I wasn't sure what to make of his character in this film.  Was he an obsessed stalker, who dreamed of having the married woman in the apartment across from his?  He pretty much told the lady so, and she didn't react in the way that I expected one would act when they find out a stranger watches her every move through the window.  Creepy!

This film completely rests on the acting ability of Giovanna Mezzogiorno, and she is simply amazing!  She physically resembles actress Debra Winger, so I kept thinking that it was her, speaking Italian, but no, this actress is just as great in her own right.  When her husband decides to help a lost elderly man with amnesia, she's ambivalent at first, especially when they have two young children and the man stays overnight.  There are lots of arguments between husband and wife, as her husband is constantly fired from jobs, and Giovanna is in a job she doesn't love (working at a chicken processing plant).  As a side hobby that pays some money, she loves to bake pastries, and it just so happens that the mysterious strangers knows a lot about baking.  The film tends to be slow moving, which only proves to me the quality of European films over American films that offer a lot of bang but little beneath the surface.  This film, however, has a lot going on beneath the surface and an unpredictable twist that really changes your perception about some of the characters.  I thought that was quite brilliant and had to watch it again to see how the knowledge would change how I viewed some scenes before the twist.

What I love most about this film was the performance of Giovanna and to see Italy on screen in a way that I remember most fondly from the three years I lived there.  I loved how this movie tested my patience and really added layers of meaning between several characters (Giovanna and her husband, Giovanna and the mysterious guest, and Giovanna and her handsome ""peeping Tom"" neighbor).  I could watch Giovanna in many films, as she really is a remarkable actress, with nuance and emotion expressed on her face without uttering a word.  The film's epilogue was brilliantly done, as it incorporates an earlier flashback scene of the elderly man's young life.  It all works incredibly well.

So why the three stars?  Because there were some flaws in the film.  There was a strange scene where Giovanna and Raoul are at an outdoor cafe and the elderly man asks Raoul about his job, so Raoul talks about it, and then the focus shifts between Raoul and Giovanna in conversation while the elderly man looks pensively at a mysterious younger man who inexplicably appears at the table.  Of course, this is a visual trick, meant to show that the man is in his own world, reminiscing about his past, but it just seemed odd to me that Giovanna and Raoul would get so caught up in conversation with one another that they completely ignore the elderly man as if he weren't there.  I didn't like that scene.  I also didn't like the friend of Giovanni who encourages her to cheat on her husband.  The friend is a dumpy looking woman, and in a film that seems to focus on beautiful people, why is it that beautiful people have such ugly friends?  The extremity seemed superficial to me (as I have lived in Italy and don't recall seeing too many ugly people as that supporting actress).  And a friend who encourages you to commit immorality isn't much of a friend.  For whatever problems occur in Giovanna's marriage, the solution doesn't reside in another man's bed, no matter how good looking and available he is.  For one thing, we never get to the heart of his obsession for Giovanna.  The film is obviously about forbidden desires and the transparency of windows.  I loved the metaphorical underpinnings of the movie, but there was something missing from the film.  It is worth seeing though, but a word of caution...be patient, for the film's pace is reflective of the Italy I know and love, which is often at odds with our American character of instantaneous combustion.",1111017600,3,4124,4.63273727647868
2137089,3,B0002XNSYU,"Love is a complex emotion.  From youth to old age, it constantly changes colors, with shades manifesting when least expected.  Perhaps this is why the cinema has maintained an immense fascination with the subjects of yearning, sexuality, passion, and comfort.

Turkish-born director Ferzan Ozpetek continues the curiosity with 'Facing Windows,' a dissection of unrequited hope in unhappy marriages.  Its central character, Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), is in the midst of discontent both at work and at home.  When an aged, decrepit man turns up out of nowhere, she discovers in him a story of similar yearning between him and another man during the chaotic Holocaust.  Giovanna investigates and along the way meets the man who lives in the apartment across from her own.  They become infatuated and she sees her sexual and romantic yearnings now have the potential to be fulfilled.

As the story unfolds, Ozpetek often loses his way, forgetting pieces here and there, losing focus, thus confusing his audience; this is a pity, considering the intelligence of some of the writing, which is appropriately passionate.  In the acting department, only Ms. Mezzogiorno stands out, inhabiting her role with utmost complexity, saving a film from its own confusion.  It is ironic her performance is the only sign of clarity and refinement in the film when her character is anything but sure.",1105920000,2,1386,5.230769230769231
2137090,4,B0002XNSYU,"This is a haunting film that tries to blend the sadness of a man's later years, where no hope remains, with the sadness of a young mother's life, where there is yet hope for the future.  The mother has a less than perfect marriage, has a frustrating job, and fantasizes a new life with the man with an an apartment with a window facing hers.  The older man has a complex and checkered past, but has been able to provide for others.  Although he can no longer find happiness or even peace in his own life, and reverts back to those times in the past where he did have love and meaning, he is still able to inspire.  The movie deals with the questions of long vs. short-term goals in one's life, moral responsibilities to a spouse, ones children and ones self, different kinds of love, and more.

2137092,4,B0002XNSYU,"This prize-winning 2003 Italian import has a lot going for it.  It's real.  It's modern.  And there's a haunting surreal quality to it.

There's a young couple with two children whose marriage is undergoing strains.  They argue a lot and the romance seems to be gone from their marriage.  There's a mysterious stranger whose window faces theirs.  The wife secretly yearns for him.  And then there is a old man found wandering in the streets.  He's lost his memory but we soon discover he's a holocaust survivor with secrets of his own.

The plot is complex, the acting is excellent, and I applaud the filmmakers for the great realistic dialog coupled with the immediate need to resolve the mystery of who the old man is.  The young wife finally meets the stranger whose windows face hers and a romance ensures.  All seems to be moving quickly with deep character development and an intriguing story.

And then, about three-quarters through the film, it turns ""post modern"".  In other words, the plot takes some implausible twists and turns, necessary scenes to develop the plot are missing,  and the audience is forced to suspend their sense of reality as basic questions go unanswered.  This disappointed me because I had really been getting into the story and there was no foreshadowing of this sudden turn of events.  And this is what holds this film back from getting more than my modest recommendation although film buffs who enjoy exploring the unusual will probably like it.",1102118400,2,1481,4.86
2137093,5,B0002XNSYU,"FACING WINDOWS  is a quiet little Masterpiece of  a film.  Director Ferszan Ozpetek and writer Gianni Romoli have plucked a bit of everyday life in a non-descript Roman sector, found ordinary people at the usual discontent with their static lives and then introduces moments of serendipity that awaken them to the meaning of being Alive.

Two apartments on the same level of neighboring buildings share window views that suggest the lack of privacy created by contemporary living styles in the cities - this city being Rome.  In one apartment lives a family of four: two children usurp to waking lives of the mother Giovanna (the radiantly gifted Giavanna Mezzogiorno) and father Filippo (Filippo Nigro, an actor of presence and depth).  Both are employed in menial jobs: Filippo works the night shift unable to progress in the work place, Giovanna is an accountant in a coarse and somewhat demeaning chicken packing plant.  Their stretch to survive leaves little room for the magic that was once romance.  The facing window of the apartment across the way is the home of the elegant, somewhat mysteriously desirable Lorenzo (Raoul Bova, as beautiful as Italian men come!).

Serendipity #1: the couple encounter an amnesiac Simone (Massimo Girotti, in his last and finest role) in the street who Filippo befriends and ultimately brings home, much to Giovanna's chagrin. Serendipity #2: Giovanna notices the man across the way (Lorenzo) who appears to have a genteel life that Giovanna secretly covets.  It is the way these two incidents intertwine and reveal the identity of Simone (who becomes known as Davide, a casualty of the concentration camps of WW II who is seen in the opening of the film in a flashback to 1943, stabbing a fellow baker who has discovered his precious love secret and leads to choices that have haunted him until his encounter with Filippo and Giovanna) that bring about the self discovery of every character in ways that will alter your views of unfounded prejudices and thwarted dreams in a way few films have.

The pacing of this mesmerizing story, the sumptuous photography, the consistently high standard of acting, and the fearless  and subtle manner in which homophobia is addressed make this a landmark movie.  When released in 2003 it won Italy's best picture, best actress, and best actor (Girotti) for very good reasons.  This graceful film deserves a very wide audience: this film is one of the great ones!  In Italian with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, November 2004",1099785600,4,2507,5.019323671497585
2137094,5,B0002XNSYU,"""Facing Windows"" is without a doubt the most beautiful film of last year... that nobody got to see. Despite winning the Italian Best Film Award in 2003, the movie went virtually unseen in the US. But it's a haunting, lush tale that, once seen, is virtually impossible to forget.

Kindhearted and scatterbrained Filippo (Filippo Nigro) encounters a befuddled old man in the streets, and takes him home to be cared for by his young wife Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno). It's the last thing Giovanna needs -- aside from two young children, she has a rotten job and a fraying marriage that has lost its spark. She also is falling in love with the handsome young man (Raoul Bova) in the window facing hers.

But the old man, Simone (Massimo Girotti), has problems of his own, including flashbacks to a violent murder in 1943. He and Giovanna start to become friends, as he teaches her how to bake pastry like a true chef. The old man's memories start to unfold in a tragic story during the Holocaust, giving guidance to what Giovanna wishes to do with her life.

""Facing Windows"" is a heavy movie -- it tackles marital problems, responsibility, Alzheimer's disease, homophobia, infidelity the Holocaust, and having your passions as the center of your life. But at its heart, it's about a woman waking up from a half-life, and reshaping things to the way they should be. Not to mention that the mountains of pastry will make viewers drool.

Ferzan Ozpetek draws viewers in as the movie becomes ever more mysterious and intriguing -- it starts off mundanely, with a flashback and a vision of a couple bickering. But the dramatic intensity begins to build, Ozpetek weaves a spiderweb of tension around the four people -- the old man, and the love triangle. His use of enigmatic flashbacks doesn't spoil the mysteries of old Simone/David's past, but rather enhances them.

Giovanna Mezzogiorno is superb as the same-named character -- she has that rare presence that fills up the screen and spills over. Her restrained performance is worshiped by the camera, which lingers all over her face. Massimo Girotti gives a subtler, but equally good performance as the old man, kindly and haunted by his tragic past.

""Don't be content to merely survive"" -- nobody knows that lesson more than someone who never really got to live his life. Passionate and poignant, ""Facing Windows"" is a lush, beautiful look through the soul's window.",1098057600,70,2417,4.868613138686132
2137095,3,B0002XNSYU,"If you are a fan of indulgent European cinema- or just films that work more through tense ambiguity and insinuation, rather than propulsive dialogue and action- then you will love this. If you loved 'Chocolat,' 'The Hairdresser's Husband,' or any of the red white & blue trilogy, you will dig this movie.

Part Love-Triangle/dissatisfied & yearning woman- part Holocaust survivor story, part overcoming the everyday staleness of life/investing it with meaning. The film tries to stand on three legs and is overbearing/ awkwardly balanced. Precarious. At least to me. I still recommend it over any of the crite love-films/romantic comedies taped up and airbombed on the american public, weekly. yes it was better than Raising Helen, but not better than Raising Arizona.

I wanted to love it, and it has a great deal going for it, mainly the main character's face (more on that below) but ultimately I left the theatre last night, more than a little dissatisfied. The film tries to accomplish too much (the holocaust survivor tangent that doesn't really get anywhere- it simply serves to heighten Giovanna's sense of personal crisis- needing to act upon her dreams and not let them dwindle), and much of the action is just a bit unelievable (when Giovanna and Lorenzo finally embark upon their...). My suspension of disbelief was pulled taut- almost to breaking.

Too much insinuation, too long, the ending was too neat (I would have ended it at the conclusion of the 'running down the stairs sequence').

However, The characters are grounded authentically. The opening scene with Giovanna and Fillipo- her being a tad bitchy and him being a big-hearted bear, it set them up well. The neighbor, Ermine, was a nice touch. The dilemma that Gio faces at work was a nice tactic to expose her timidity which she begins to work through.

I will say this: Giovanna Mezzogiorno gives a superb performance, working well with what the script gives her. Also- DAMN. What a face. Her countenance more than made the film worthwhile and enjoyable, and (since this is European film) the filmgoer is treated to myriad shots of her, looking out the window, staring into space, pensively daydreaming... The camera works lingers on her eyes, lips and brow, never tiring... She has a magnificently expressive visage- the kind of face that probably won't turn heads on the street, at a glance- but lures you in, more and more. I can't say enough about her.

Nice film score, I'll be considering picking up the soundtrack once it's dropped a few bucks and isn't special order any more. The musical theme reminds one of the Kronos Quartet's strings n' beats from ',Requiem for a Dream,' though less scarred by loss and anguish, more wishful and understated. It worked well.

All in all, I probably won't see it again, but I'd recommend it to my artier friends.",1097539200,7,2835,4.918410041841004
2137096,5,B0002XNSYU,"""Facing Windows"" realistically depicts a modern young Italian family, frustrated in lives that have much potential by are going nowhere. Giovanna (subtly portrayed by the lovely Giovanna Mezzogiorno) hates her job as an accountant in a poultry factory; her true love is baking, and she bakes pies and cakes in the evening to earn a little extra cash. Husband Filippo (Filippo Nigro) is stymied by family politics in his low-paying job and can't even make it off 3rd shift. The household's tension and unhappiness is leavened somewhat by its two young children. Whatever spark once existed between husband and wife is dampened by the rigors of parenthood and lack of job mobility. In a window across an alley, Giovanna spies on the carefree antics of Lorenzo, independent and sexy. It's seems only a matter of time before Giovanna makes fantasy a reality and escapes the confines of her unfulfilled life.

One day, the couple meets ""Simone,"" a confused old man handing out wads of cash. Simone doesn't know who he is. Filippo kind-heartedly takes him in, supposedly just for the night. The old man has his own secrets and soon turns the couple's life upside down, bringing additional craziness and surprising sanity into the chaos of their lives.

The movie is outstanding. It has terrific writing, believable and sympathetic characters, a story with odd twists and turns and the beautiful Roman cityscape as its background. The soundtrack is terrific as well. One hauntingly beautiful song, ""Gocce di Memoria,"" is repeated throughout the film. Take the R-rating seriously.

8034223,4,B0002XNSYU,"It's difficult to decided whether this is a 3 or 4 star film. I'll go with grading up and saying that it is a good modern story with elements of some mystery and romance brought into the life of an Italian family with a focus on the female lead who is a mother and wife who also works in a managerial job. The film uses the form or plot element of the lost old man who comes into contact with a family and causes people to stop in their routines a bit and respond to him. I'm an American who is in the process of learning some Italian, so my 4-star rating is due in part to my enjoyment of watching the social cues and listening to the language. Giovanna Mezzogiorno is an attractive actress, and she performs well in the lead role. The visual device of the act of looking through windows and characters watching each other at different times gives a slight nod to Hitchcock's classic film Rear Window. The story also contains references to historical events in a way that deepens the story a bit.

8034226,5,B0002XNSYU,"Facing Windows is about Giovanna,a bookkeeper in a company which packs chickens. She is married to a man who has a precarious job. First she starts being curious about a young man who lives in the block opposite hers, and then she falls in love with him. The relationship between the two becomes much stronger when she starts to find out more about him from an old man who bursts into their lives. The old man, obsessed with the memories of some things that happened n the long past autumn of 1943,has lost his memory and finds refuge in her.

In the film that touches marriage,sexuality and holocaust,young married couple Giovanna and Filippo have been married long enough to have become almost completely jaded by their lots in life, with most of their individual aspirations having been set aside some time ago. As their marriage begins to fall apart, the two encounter a strange old man who calls himself Simone since he can't seem to recall his real name or much about his past history. Filippo brings the man home to stay with them, which initially irritates Giovanna. Over time, she gradually befriends the confused old man and eventually notices a tattoo on his arm indicative of his being a WWII Holocaust survivor. Taking ""Simone"" to an old Roman ghetto, she helps him remember his name and his time spent in that very ghetto -- which includes recalling the very painful memory of his lover Simone's capture and murder at the hands of the Nazis. Meanwhile, Giovanna has been spending her free time impulsively peeping across the street at her attractive neighbor Lorenzo -- who in turn has been spying on her. Giovanna is thus forced to decide between Filippo and Lorenzo, as well as possibly realizing a long dormant professional dream that her new friend Davide may be able to help her undertake.

This Italian film is one great one that it has many characteristics that would satisfy the viewer. The characters are compelling enough to make it worth the view. Aside from that,the brilliant cast generated fine performances and the screenplay was absorbing as well as it blends romance, mystery and fantasy to in telling the narrative from beginning to end. The only thing that would probably considered the film's weakness is its tendency to be melodramatic in some scenes that it needs to be.
