5722362,5,B00CHYSQQC,"Everyone has their coping mechanism --- that THING they do that helps them deal with some of life's harshest realities. Some may call the people featured in the Rick Springfield documentary, AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART ""scary, over the top fans"" and they'd totally be missing the point. I had the pleasure of seeing AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART at the Florida Film Festival in April 2012.

The filmmakers have made themselves a gem with this film. From start to finish, they managed to capture the energy that you feel when you go to one of Rick's shows and the beauty is that this movie is not about Rick but about the unique connection he has with his fans. You get that feeling when you go to his shows and for the Rick Virgins out there who fancy themselves too cool for a concert, they will be left wondering why they ever doubted Rick's talent for rock-n-roll and his ability to woo an audience. If you're still skeptical, then you haven't seen Rick take on a hostile crowd of heavy metal rockers in Sweden. You'll get to in this movie  -  just one of many wonderful moments captured on film.

As previously mentioned, there are a set of fans featured in this movie that run the gamut between twitterpated 40-something housewives to those who literally survived heartache thanks to the bond they have forged with Rick Springfield. This selection of fans embody the human spirit that is alive and well in the Rick Springfield family of fans where the stories of triumph are thanks the devotion to a rock star who he, himself has battled some of the same challenges and lived to rock another day. I find it ironic that for a man who is haunted by his demons, he finds the will to share himself with each person he meets and give the very best of himself at every show. You could see it in this film and it's no wonder that so many have taken him into their lives",1373587200,,1855,4.415204678362573
5722363,5,B00CHYSQQC,"Any Rick Springfield fan would enjoy this and want it for their collection.  After seeing this, it converted a friend of mine who now loves Rick just as much as I do.  Can't go wrong with this purchase.",1373587200,,202,4.2894736842105265
5722364,4,B00CHYSQQC,"This documentary looks into not only the success of Rick Springfield but what truly makes the man successful, his fans. You'll meet die hards and hear about their lives and how being a Rick fan has changed or helped them or just gives them a girls night out. It's so great because it's a very personal look into the life of the fans and their favorite rocker, right down to the husbands having to go to a show to see what this guy is really about. It's a heartwarming piece and of course full of Rick music and interviews. It's a must have for the Rick fan.",1373587200,,557,4.214953271028038
5722365,5,B00CHYSQQC,"I have seen a screening of this documentary & if were not already a fan, this documentary would certainly make me one. Seeing the effects this artist/musician/man has had on so many lives is an incredible journey. Plus he has a beautiful soul. Kudos to everyone involved in this project. I cannot wait to receive the DVD and watch it again.",1373587200,,340,4.590163934426229
5722366,5,B00CHYSQQC,"I saw An Affair of the Heart at it's theatrical premier in New York City this past October and I absolutely loved it.  It also just had its TV premiere on the Epix cable channel on May 15th.  It's a touching and heartwarming film that focuses on the connection between Rick and his fans. It features several fan stories and gives great insight of the man who loves his fans as much as they love him.  It shows how genuinely grateful and humbled Rick is when he talks about his fans, some of whom have been following his career for over 30 years!  There is absolutely no rock-star ego here.

 You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll be inspired ...and if you're not a fan before you watch the film, you will definitely be one once you've seen it!  I cannot wait to get my DVD so I can watch it again as well as see all the extras that are included on it.  It's a must see for everyone and I know you'll love it.  I sure do!!",1373414400,,920,4.123595505617978
5722367,4,B00CHYSQQC,"Emily at BluntReview (dot)com says: Music, for some, is just a nice kind of background cacophony of notes strung together that they use to invigorate, stimulate, unwind or get through. For others, a group, or a song, absolutely grips into a part of the brain that would otherwise seek pharmaceuticals for such wild reactions of visceral happiness. The rush of endorphins creates a bond. In many cases, a loyal bond that spreads over decades - and Billboard popularity.

Being of the later group myself (I had/have""The Keiths"" - Moon and Richards), I really enjoyed the look into pop star Rick Springfield's current going ons, and those who are still following his creations. Admittedly, I'd (sadly) dismissed this real talent, as a bubble gum sort of McCutey. I glanced, gave a listen, and pinned him as a marketing campaign wrapped into an - obviously - handsome shell with a perfectly sellable song or two. Well, yes, and no.

Here in An Affair of the Heart Springfield - who by the way is aging stunningly - is what every fan girl (or guy) wishes of their idols. He gets up in the rain and plays, comes down to great - even sets up cruises where he hangs out with a few die hards.

Okay, a few humbled rockers now feel safe enough to do a meet-and-greet post show, but Rick truly gets into the minutia of a few of his fans' lives.

There's not a lot of behind the faade here. He does have a `newish' memoir book, and I am guessing one would want to get that for ""the dirt"" so to speak. But, the film makers introduce us to a few at-every-show gals - who are happily married and very normal. They just need their fix, and will drive, fly or sail for that specialized shot. Then there is a warm Unitarian Universalist Minister who used the words and music of Springfield to bring a terrible event to pass (as much as she was able). Another, deeply devoted woman was ""introduced"" to Rick and his music as a `tween who was facing a surgery that would save her life or not...his music helped her cope and feel viable. Then there is the child, Dustin Walker. Rick drags a three-year-old on to his stage to sing for the crowd. They stay in touch. Now, years later, the young man is a guitar player and at 14, hits the stage to play with Rick.

You'll see the wife of thirty years, and Springfield admits he went through that rock star dick phase; she must be one helluva catch to stand by and wait for the maturity to catch up to the Adonis-y coating. But, this man has come through to the other side with - what appears to be - genuine warmth. And, he can play some rock and roll. At a rock festival concert along with Aerosmith, where even attendees had the RCA dog head tilt, Ricky came out and rocked it up. Remember he had 17 songs on the charts back when...

The documentary is touching and telling. Truly impressive for those who had the bedroom walls dressed with images of a stranger you adored without knowing exactly why as the frontal cortex struggled to settle down. And don't fear...he gets to ""The Song."" Jessie's Girl. One of the most memorable time snapshot singles ever made. The video for the hit now looks like the guy's a weird-o stalker re-enactment for DateLine...but dig those crazy prints and puffed up hairdos.

See this. It reminds you that beneath the music, every once in a while (unlike say ruder-than- you-could-have-ever-imagined Simon Townsend) you meet another Rick Danko sort. A creator of music that loves what they're doing, and appreciates those who give a s***.",1370563200,22,3496,4.522151898734177

I wish that non-Rick fans would take the time to watch this to FINALLY see why we die-hard fans love Rick so much!  Not only is he amazingly talented musically, and pretty easy on the eyes - - Rick makes his fans feel that they just as important to him as he is to us!

5722394,5,B00CHYSQQC,"The last few months I've been going through a documentary phase, partly
because I plan on producing one myself, but mostly because I always
found them fascinating. A friend suggested that I watch ""An Affair of
the Heart"", a doc about 80's pop-star Rick Springfield. While not a
die-hard fan like the ones featured in the film, I appreciated his
music and relevance at the time.

I have to say first and foremost, the film made me care about Rick; he
was forthright with his issues and demons and I feel he and the
filmmakers presented an honest perspective. At one point the film cut
to personal stories about people facing adversity and I was ""what does
this have to do with Rick Springfield?"", but that soon turned into some
of the most touching footage of the film. I know how important it is to
touch someone and have them resonate with you, and the film showed us
that Rick has compassion towards people and his fans...when they need
him.

I thought the pacing was excellent, with the right amount of
interview/fan segments and concert footage. I was never bored and don't
think I picked up my tablet once during the film. Some of my favorite
segments were on the cruise ship with just Rick and his piano, pouring
out his heart. I met my best friend in an Elton John chat room on AOL
20 years ago, so I could relate to the Rick Springfield fans meeting
and bonding for life as well.

From a technical perspective, it was shot well...no shaky, amateurish
looking shots and the concert footage was excellent. The sound and
editing were top-notch as well and I appreciate all the work that goes
into a production of this magnitude. Great job!",1426982400,2,1644,4.547297297297297
5722395,4,B00CHYSQQC,"I happen to believe this DVD is exactly what it claims to be. This was promoted as a film made by Rick fans about Rick fans. They seemed to focus on a smaller group of fans than they should have, but I'm sure they have a limited budget, so I understand. I do wonder about some of his fans unhealthy addiction to him. I am a fan, and thought I was a huge fan.",1426118400,,358,3.8513513513513513
5722396,4,B00CHYSQQC,"Very interesting!! IFor me however I wish it had more concert footage, but I must be honest. That is not really what this DVD was about, I still enjoyed very much....  Also I am a big Rick Springfield male fan and the film did not cover us male fans very good at all. I like Rick Springfield because of his raw talent in the number of instruements he can play and just how well he can do it. And his vocal abilitys and so much more. His writeing ability's are so awesome, and this is coming from a huge KISS Fan / 70's / On the edge Rock Music Fan!!  Not a One Direction Fan!!!!",1424736000,,578,4.017391304347826

5722402,3,B00CHYSQQC,"I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I watched this on AmazonPrime. This is more about fanatical Rick Springfield fans than it is about Rick Springfield. I think the DVD was well done -- the interviews were genuine and the footage was strong. It's obvious that Springfield himself believed in the project, and that really helped it shine. The performance footage was strong, too. Just be prepared to hear more about the everyday person who is obsessed with Springfield. There are some touching stories as well as some headscratchers.

5722415,3,B00CHYSQQC,"First off I have to start off this review by communicating that Rick Springfield was and still is my first childhood crush. I fell in love with him and his music in 1982 and have been in love ever since, luckily my hubby is very understanding. :-) Anyhoo, so you can imagine how badly I wanted to get my hands on Rick, oops, meant the DVD.  :-)  I finally bought it and hubby and I watched it and frankly we were not completely impressed.

The parts of the DVD with Rick are extraordinary. What I did not like were the attention put on ""the die hard fans"". Sorry but these women were bordering on stalker-ish. There was one in particular who is married with kids and is perfectly fine going off to see Rick on tour regardless of what upsets this creates for her Husband and kids. Her husband is obviously disturbed by his wife's childish behavior but she thinks nothing of it. This is the kind of reality tv drama that I could have done with out. I would love a DVD that just featured Rick now that would be more pleasurable for a Rick fan. :-)",1399939200,2,1044,4.262626262626263
5722416,5,B00CHYSQQC,"This movie really gets to the heart of what it means to be a true fan.  The variety of people who candidly tell their stories throughout the film makes it possible for everyone who sees it, to see themselves in some way.  This documentary shows the powerful, human connection between Rick Springfield and his fans, and it's a rare gem that shows how a popular musician's success is not just about his talents but instead, it's about the people who find solace in his music and support him.",1399680000,,489,4.545454545454546

I have seen him in concert ten times but never once have met the man, but I know just how much his music touches his fans all on a different level. No matter the age or the person, the songs he writes leave a lasting impression on your soul and it was so nice to see the different fans interviewed and how he has impacted their lives. Seeing this was very heartwarming and made me tear up in a few spots of this documentary. I liked how the focus was on this instead of just the hearth throb label. What was left out that I thought we would see was maybe his love for animals, but since this was a fan focused film, that is what we got. For the real fans out there who want a glimpse of Rick's life as it affects his fans as he travels around and performs, this is a nice treat. If you are looking for only live concert footage, even though there are some inserted here and there, this would not be something you would want then.

5722420,4,B00CHYSQQC,"I'm going to risk angering a million wonderful Rick fans.... and I include myself in that group as well as my fiancee.  Don't just mark unhelpful because you don't like my lower than 5 star review, I'm trying to give a realistic view to many potential buyers who love Ricks music.  We've met Rick and seen his show several times so I'm NOT a hater.

The reason I can't rate this any higher is I view this as a missed  opportunity at a stone cold 5 star mega hit.  While the film is very fun, and shows a unique relationship Rick has with his fan base, or the super fans to be more specific, it is not something a music fan of Ricks would want to watch over and over.... it's just too FAN heavy and too MUSIC light.  To make things worse they do cut away to some incredible HD, high volume rockin' tunes during this documentary but then back to the stars of the film, the fans... and the story of the doc which runs the gambit from sweet and touching to creepy imho.  For me, instead of a bonus disc of more super level fans... a bonus disc containing a full tilt music only show either from one night or culled from the excellent footage we music fans of Ricks get teased with during the documentary would have made this a desert island collection.

If you are like me, a fan of Ricks music , and I am a big power pop fan and consider him a true musician , not a soap star wannabee rocker..... you run the risk of being tantalized by music used as a link to more fan following, than you may want to sit through. The second disc.... unless you're on it , and many many fans are... is superfluous.

Just keeping it real for the folks who may be music fans and want a clear picture of this film.... hoping for a concert video on blu ray.. heck his most recent was on the HD network, why not put it out on BR?",1393632000,4,1805,4.105113636363637

5722430,5,B00CHYSQQC,"Rick Springfield is an amazing musician and his lyrics are so relatable to me now that I am older.  I have enjoyed his music since I was 13, and as a 43 year old mom, I still enjoy going to his concerts (3-4 per year) and getting my Rick fix.  I've met him twice and had photos taken with him and he is just as nice as could be! This DVD really captures why we love Rick and why it really is our own Affair of the Heart.  You will see him perform in large venues and smaller venues, even in the rain and he still gives top notch performances each time!  I thoroughly enjoyed this video and I can't wait to get my next Rick fix!!!",1385769600,,629,3.9291338582677167

I was so looking forward to seeing a lot of Rick on this DVD.  Unfortunately, this is mostly about his fans.  There is much too much time spent following around two star-gazed women with jealous husbands, and not enough of Rick for me.  He does perform some of his music, but mostly in 30 second clips from concerts.  He is still gorgeous, so any time on screen is great.  There are some good moments he spends talking to his fans, and you can tell he really does care about us.  That being said, fewer fans and more of Rick would have been better.",1384300800,2,674,4.2109375

5722442,5,B00CHYSQQC,"This was such a pleasant surprise.  I was expecting some concert footage and lots of female fans expressing their love for this criminally underrated singer/songwriter.  But the filmmakers offer so much more.  They show the stories behind the adoration which prove there is much more to all this than meets the eye.  The extreme fascination with Rick Springfield and his music is so often deeply rooted in people's own demons, their own tragic backstories.  And Springfield, himself fighting daily battles with depression from an early age onwards, understands this all too well.  Therefore he not only encourages the contact to his fans, he clearly enjoys bringing down the barriers between artist and fan in order to share his music as a way of communication.

The filmmakers not only make this point in a very touching and persuasive way, they also have created a hugely entertaining film that is funny, sad, interesting and wonderfully fast-paced.  These 90 minutes fly by, with the perfect rhythm and heart and intellect that the performer's songs have themselves.

Highly recommended!",1376956800,,1090,5.182857142857143

I found myself smiling through the majority of the DVD - and there were a few tears.  I liked the story of Justin - how great for him.  The trading of the airline ticket.  The Wisconsin and cruise performances.  But I especially liked seeing Rick at the piano, with his wife sitting behind him, while he sang ""Ordinary Girl"" (her song).  I could see how much she truly loves him (and that's why she stayed, if you have read Late, Late at Night).  Good work!!",1376870400,,603,4.321428571428571

5722445,1,B00CHYSQQC,"sure, you'll see that I don't own this.  so why am I writing about it?  so that I can encourage people to buy it somewhere else.  find a place, any place, as long as it's not amazon.  target dot com has the Blu-ray version for less, although they are backordered.

I placed an order, with the item in stock.  2 weeks later, it still hadn't shipped.  when I saw it finally processed authorization on my card and still didn't ship, I called in to see what was going on.  oh, it'll ship on or before next Mon?  what?!?  it's already been a full two weeks and they've processed my card.  I advised that if it didn't ship by the end of that day that I'd just cancel and go elsewhere.  6 hours later, I get an email from the person I spoke to saying that she couldn't cancel the order.  what?!?  I didn't ask her to.  so the next morning, when I saw it was still 'shipping soon' and not 'shipped' I tried to cancel it but the option for the cancel button that was there the previous morning (prior to calling in) was gone.  they wouldn't let me cancel the order!  what?!?

so each day since then, I go back to try to cancel.  it kept showing as 'shipping soon'.  finally the day she told me it would ship passed and the ship date was pushed back another day.  what?!?  I still tried to keep on with the cancellation, but nothing solidified.  so I'm closing down my amazon e-mail preferences and removing my payment info and getting ready to shut down my account once this outstanding order is cleared up.

then I get an email that my card was denied.  what?!?  I look at my card and there's no problem there.  it's just another juvenile delay tactic from amazon.  I call in and even that lady doesn't understand why it was in stock but still hadn't shipped. she said maybe me removing all my CC info might've been why it was denied.  no way!  there was an authorization on my card and the order on the amazon site even showed the last 4 of the CC.  nothing but a bunch of baloney.

so I'm certain this is a fine product.  I've heard a lot of good things about it.  but I won't be getting it from amazon.  whatever company I do buy it from will get the solid review that will focus only on the product and nothing else.  if I were you, I'd search a little longer and find it somewhere else to buy.  I've been an amazon customer since the 90s and they wanted to dig in their heels over this matter.  fixing a $20-something order being shipped in a timely manner has not only cost them a long-time customer but I'll be sharing this anytime the amazon name is brought up so that it will impact the decision of others to make sure they are finding the best service they can get...hopefully somewhere else.",1375833600,,2694,4.230314960629921

After buying and watching the DVD Friday night, I fell even more for the man who I have long since viewed as my favorite musician, and one of my favorite people on the planet!  I respected Rick even more after reading his wonderful book LATE LATE AT NIGHT, but watching AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART helped me see him as a super nice everyday person, who faces his demons and wants to give back to others, while making amends for his personal regrets.  It is obvious that Rick's quest through is heart and music is to make people happy!  The stories of how Rick has personally touched the lives of everyday people going through their own journeys is something to behold... A true affair of the heart for his many fans and friends!  One tear, one note, one lyric, one heartbeat from that man heals many!! This is a very worthy watch!  My hubby even liked it!!  :)",1375574400,,1027,4.407407407407407

I was very lucky and honored to meet him for the first time in 2011.  He was so friendly and sweet that I knew I had to go on the last cruise he did that year.  I saw first hand how Rick and all his staff go out of their way to make sure we all had a wonderful time.  I was able to go backstage again at a recent concert and I was so touched when he remembered me.  I didn't have to tell him my name when he signed my guitar and pics.  He even drew a picture of his beloved dog Gomer for me.  The love we all have for Rick and he for us is truly An Affair Of The Heart !,1375056000,,764,3.6503067484662575

5722462,4,B00CHYSQQC,"I just watched this on EPIX.COM. I have to say that I am blown away by how immature some of these women are. Leaving their kids for who knows how long to follow him on tour. The two friends from NJ who one has a bobble head doll of herself that Rick has signed, are clearly hurting their husbands by going to these concerts. One even wrote a song titled The Man, about how he wants to be the man getting his wife's attention.
Apparently they have no idea what this is doing to their husbands. I like Rick, saw him in concert in the pouring rain, in Florida in 84, and followed his limo to his hotel. He waved at us from his balcony window. I was 18. I watched him on GH, and even watched during GH's 50th anniversary to see him. But there is no way I would leave my husband and children to travel to see him. I would not want to hurt my husband in that way.

Regardless of those women it was a good documentary that any Rick Springfield fan would enjoy. I think it is horribly sad that they put this above their families, and act like he is a god.",1374192000,4,1047,4.033653846153846

If you are a fan of Rick Springfield now or back in the 80's when it all began, you must buy it. It shows the relationships that fans have with Rick and the bond that has lasted over 30 years. Rick is a great man and very talented as a musician, songwriter and author. He is REAL you won't find a celebrity that has the loyal fan base that Rick has, it is because he cares.  He still tours and does over 100 shows a year.  Rick has helped thousands of fans get through some pretty hard things in their lives just through his music, I am one of them.

His pictures plastered my walls in the 80s, hands down my favorite artist with good reason for over 30 years. This documentary by Melanie Lentz-Janney and Sylvia Caminer was clearly made with much love, respect and honesty. Rick Springfield would probably be the first to admit that he's not perfect,but he is always trying and NEVER gives up. He and has music have lifted me up out of many trying times. To see this feeling repeated in the heart's and emotions of many other fans,as this film shows makes me ecstatic. I can honestly say it offers something to everyone, not just die-hard fans. It shows you shouldalways reach for the top, keep striving. An Affair of the Heart warms the heart, and makes you laugh out load. It brought me back to my childhood, what more could you want?

This movie gives Rick Springfield's fans a glimpse in to the heart of this rock legend - which is very tender indeed - especially toward his loyal fans.  Rick has matured into more than just an accomplished performer, actor, singer, artist, writer, and amazing guitar player, he has arrived at that spot in life where he loves what he does and realizes that the deep connection with his followers is the reason he continues to thrive as an artist.  The tenderness with which Rick interacts with his fans explains why he continues to succeed!
One also sees Rick through the eyes of his adoring fans.  Cult following would not be the correct description... but faithful and maybe a bit obsessive.  Heartstrings are pulled and one can't help but laugh out loud or maybe, more appropriately, giggle like a school girl alongside some of Rick true fans.
I honestly didn't know what to expect from this movie.  I loved it!  Enjoyable, fun, and very touching.",1373932800,10,1008,4.693181818181818

5722478,5,B00CHYSQQC,"This really brings back memories of my daughter and great friends, both the ones I knew and the ones I met at Rick concerts. Rick fans are the best!  There are many stories I could relay about chance meetings with Rick and the band after shows and how kind and caring he was to all of us. My daughter and two friends were amazed when he lifted them up on stage to sing with him one night.  He really loves kids. One time he even came to visit a friend, who had developed a medical problem at a concert.  He was so concerned about her and wanted to make sure she was going to be ok.  What a gentle spirit he is, not to mention the talent he possesses.  If I had ten thumbs, they would all be up for this great addition to Rickdom!!",1373846400,3,730,4.006896551724138
5722479,5,B00CHYSQQC,"I have been a long time Rick Springfield fan, and thanks to the Internet, have become friends with so many people.  This documentary is a testament to the wonderful fans that Rick has, not just here in the US, but all over the world.  It makes me so happy watching this and seeing how much his music has affected so many people over the years.  It did the same for me during my fight with breast cancer over two years ago.  My doctor allowed me to listen to Rick's music while I was undergoing my lumpectomy and my double mastectomy. After my surgeries, I listened to Rick to help me heal and to get through the rough times.  I got the chance a few months later to tell that story to Rick and it was awesome...
Thanks Rick for all that you have done for so many of us over the years!!",1373846400,3,784,4.131578947368421

5722492,5,B00CHYSQQC,"This documentary doesn't bore like some do - it has fun footage from concerts and highlights the unique relationship that Rick Springfield has with his very diverse fan base. Though the first thing that you may think of is ""Jessie's Girl"" you will come away from this with an appreciation for the body of work and - well, HIS fantastic body - they will surpass your expectations. A must see!",1373587200,,391,4.6
5722493,5,B00CHYSQQC,"I must say Rick Springfield is so much more than ""Jessie's Girl"" and his fans will be the 1st to tell you that. He has an amazing fan base and they LOVE this man, music and will stand by him any day of the week. His Rickumentary proves what a special person he and his fans are.

5722496,5,B00CHYSQQC,"A must see documentary for anyone who has ever had an idol or just loves music. This shows how Rick Springfield in particular has influenced the lives of a few of his legion of fans. The relationship between a person and their idol can mean so many different things to each person. Rick and his music has influenced so many. Its not a movie about Rick Springfield, its a film that shows what a special influence he has has on the lives of ""real"" people. Its real and its honest. Watch it today!",1373587200,,494,4.32258064516129
5722497,5,B00CHYSQQC,"I have been a Rick fan since ""Working Class Dog"" so, of course, I had to watch ""An Affair of the Heart"". I know a lot of women are crazy about him for his looks and the thrill of hearing him perform, but this documentary goes way beyond all of that. It was so inspiring to see the lengths that people, both men and women, were and continue to be touched by Rick. I am in awe by how much Rick loves his fans and has the desire to connect with them on a personal level. For me, at age 11, Rick started out as a heartthrob, now 31 years later, I find myself using his music and his personal struggles to get through some of my own challenges. Watching ""An Affair of the Heart"" showed me there are so many others that have also been touched in a very personal way. This doc will make those that love him, love him more and those that thought they knew what he was all about, see the real Rick.",1373587200,,889,4.0

8581915,5,B00CHYSQQC,This is excellent. Shipping was good. It does have a minor skip. I didn't bother to return it. It is a fun movie and Rick grew up a alot. At first I was like RIck is getting older  then I had to remember Rick is somewhere around 70. I was a 8 year old kids watching him. Rick looks amazing for his age and in fact sheds alot of wisdom in the fun dvd.. You have to see it. Happy watching,1511222400,,386,3.765432098765432

8581919,5,B00CHYSQQC,After watching this documentary I appreciate Rick's music more now than I did decades ago. It was fun to watch some of his over the top fans. They stuck with him since the 1980's and he has gained new fans like 14 yr. old Dustin. I don't understand that level of obsession but Rick is talented & charismatic. He still looks good in his 60's.,1484697600,,341,4.2615384615384615
