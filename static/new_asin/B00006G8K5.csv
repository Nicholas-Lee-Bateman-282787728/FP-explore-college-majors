1755794,4,B00006G8K5,"At this point in time, I believe that only a fraction of the history of submarines has been written.  One thing that is not a Cold War secret by any means, however, is the fact that being a submariner is a dangerous job indeed.  If something ever goes wrong, your odds of surviving the crisis are very low.  This documentary looks back on four such disasters, two American and two Russian/Soviet.  Remarkably, a number of men lived to tell the tale of two of them.

The documentary opens and closes with the Kursk disaster, which was still a fairly recent event when this video was released in 2002.  Most people are familiar with the Kursk, as it was a huge international story - made even more memorable by the initial attempts by the Russian government to downplay the severity of the accident (and with it the embarrassment of losing the most prominent sub in their navy).  All 118 men onboard died, 23 of whom could have been saved if Russia had accepted international offers of assistance in the immediate aftermath of the accident.  A second Russian (Soviet) sub also makes the list, and that would be APL K-19, also known as The Widowmaker.  Having narrowly avoided a collision with an American sub weeks earlier, K-19 fell victim to a radioactive coolant link.  Unable to send any distress signal due to a damaged antenna, many onboard survived thanks to eight heroic volunteers who exposed themselves to deadly radiation in order to rig up another cooling unit.  This documentary states that these men knew they were accepting a suicide mission, but I have read other sources that say the men were not informed of the danger.

The other two submarine disasters chronicled here are American.  One of them, the USS Thresher in 1963, remains the deadliest sub disaster in history.  The Thresher was lost during deep-diving trials when a valve failure ultimately led to a nuclear reactor shutdown.  There was never any hope of saving the 129 men onboard this sub because it literally imploded after sinking below its maximum depth.  The story of the USS Squalus, which sank in 1939, is not so tragic a story, as 33 of its men were rescued (some 30 hours after the accident) by the brand new and untested Momsen Chamber (or McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber).  All these decades later, it is still the greatest submarine rescue in history.

This documentary doesn't attempt to analyze what went wrong in these four submarine disasters, but it does offer a very good overview of the events themselves.  It also makes you respect all the more those men and women who risk their lives for months on end inside these gigantic tin cans in service to their country.  As the Cold War secrets of submarine warfare continue to be released, I believe we will have more and more reason to honor all of the men of the silent service - but especially those who never got to come home.",1290729600,2,2874,4.698602794411178

  Which one is better between Human Right
  or Patriotism? !!!!!

 ""Saving crews, As soon As possible"" is vital benefit compare with
  ""Seeking,by their own techniques first,but in failure,then seeking
  other's help without benefit of Patriotism !
  1) USS Squalus(SS-192): on23,May,1939, a Diesel-Electric oriented Submarine
  sunked to depth of 243feet(74m). Cause: Flood of Aft. Torpedo Room Compartment

  33 Crews were saved.

1755796,5,B00006G8K5,"Being a Navy veteran ( I didn't have my Dolphins), I am keen on Naval disasters, and I remembered the incidents related to this video. Like all National Geographic productions, it is top-notch. I wish it were even a bit longer, as this held my interest from credit to credit. I can watch this video more than once, and enjoy it, and learn from it. I heartily recommend this film for historians, those who love the sea, and those who see the drama and human interest involved with such happenings.",1236384000,,496,4.522222222222222

Information about the subs, films of the wrecks when possible, interviews with family members, are all interwoven into a good story.  My only complaint is that they only picked a couple of subs and could have done a lot more.",1199232000,3,312,4.654545454545454
1755798,5,B00006G8K5,"Captions for ""Lost Subs"" were, at least, attempted, unlike ""Pearl Harbor,"" but they weren't very good. Many of the captions were cut off, much like typing off the edge of a page, which ruined much of the legibility.

1755800,1,B00006G8K5,"I am a fan of the National Geographic series, but the poor quality of this relatively new issue was a deep disappointment.  Rather than tracing the flaws in design, production, or emergency procedures through the evolution of the submarine (as I had expected), the documentary spent a huge amount of footage on filler, including a lengthy bit of fluff about the fun-loving antics of a current submarine crew.  The facts that led to the demise or near-demise of each submarine were glossed over, while the camera dwelt at great length on the anguish of a few of the survivors. The incidents were presented nearly free of scientific content or historic context.",1045008000,54,659,4.927927927927928

1755834,5,B00006G8K5,"Excellent documentary. I would not recommend loaning it out to those who have a father, son, brother, etc. currently in the Silent Service though.  Which means I will not be loaning it to a history buff whose son is serving on a Virginia class attack sub. If you do not meet that criteria, this is worth your time and money. It includes information on K-19 (the so called Widowmaker of the movie), THe Kursk (both Soviet subs), and the USS Thresher. It includes other sub disasters as well and a short history of methods developed to rescue the souls of those on downed subs if such rescue is possible.",1415577600,2,602,4.522935779816514

1755836,5,B00006G8K5,"You can why this type of profession would be shunned by most folkes.  It's very hard to think of a worse way to lose you're life, than underwater.  The Kursk disater was especially trajic, as the russians stubbornly refused international offer of aide.  Although that crew may well have been doomed right from the moment the sub left the harbor.  I guess it must take a particular type of person to go down into those tin cylinders, and do their jobs.  My hat's off to them, not just for their patriotism, but for their courage in the face of a very dangerous task.  JRV",1399852800,,570,4.4326923076923075
