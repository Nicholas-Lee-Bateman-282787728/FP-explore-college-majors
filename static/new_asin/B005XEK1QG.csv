8639872,5,B005XEK1QG,I had seen the trailer for this DVD several times and finally had the chance to see it. I thought the actors did a great job portraying the message and it was well written.  It was well written and I feel that Winstead Barnes did an excellent job!! I will definitely watch other films from this director and with Winstead Barnes in it!!,1340841600,,336,4.333333333333333
8639873,4,B005XEK1QG,"Great performance and good luck on many more. The play portrays real issues and topics that mirror reality...issues that should be discussed more often. Thanks for being courageous enough to tackle these issues in love, friendships, relationships, and all the drama in between.",1329523200,,277,5.465116279069767

8639875,5,B005XEK1QG,A Player's Last Play was an awesome play! All the character's displayed great talent! The play wasn't what I had expected but BETTER! It was a reminder of real life consequences that the majority ignores or don't take seriously in life. The play had me on the edge of my bed the whole time..Loved it...and yes it was a Player's Last Play!!! Will add future plays to my collection! Great Job Everyone!,1325289600,,400,4.569444444444445
8639876,5,B005XEK1QG,"A Player's Last Play really kept my attention the whole time, was very easy to follow, and I gained so many important messages from the play including- DON'T take your life for granted, don't take someone ELSE'S life for granted, and most of all- understand the HORRIBLE repercussions that can come of sleeping around with random people. Winstead played his part SO well as did many of the other actors. GREAT JOB EVERYONE!!! :-D",1321315200,,429,4.8108108108108105
8639877,4,B005XEK1QG,"The play was a interesting written play, and the acting for most of the characters were excellent. The main character Mr. Barnes (aka) Sean, and the demon possesed girl/low self esteemed girl,loved it. One thing that didn't sit too well with me was the cameras used, one was better than the other upon my initial viewing of the dvd. Other than that technical issue, it was a well thought out and presented.",1320710400,,406,4.652777777777778
8639878,5,B005XEK1QG,"This play was phenomenal. As indicative of Mr. Dillard's plays, this production illustrates a compelling moral issue that is permeating our present day society. Upon viewing this play it stimulates one to analyze their sense of moral justice. It demonstrates how our life decisions directly effect and affect the lives of others. Ultimately, those decisions have reciprocity.",1319414400,,375,5.5964912280701755
