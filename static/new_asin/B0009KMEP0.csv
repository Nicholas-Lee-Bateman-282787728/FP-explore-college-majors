8062674,5,B0009KMEP0,"Well, in the beach party movies sense of rocking at least. This is really a horrible movie, which is what makes it so great. From the bad acting, to the horrible monster costumes, to the plot that makes little sense (blow up sea creatures with sodium??). Get the uncut version for the extra gory ketchup blood scenes, it is worth it. The songs and dance routines are unforgettable, especially the zombie stomp, and wigglin wobblin.",1342310400,,431,4.76
8062675,5,B0009KMEP0,"One of the worst of the monster beach party flicks of the 60s. If you are like me and love cheesy monsters, terrible acting, illogical plotlines (a creature that lives in salt water can only be destroyed with salt!) and whacked out music, this is for you! I do, so 5 stars!",1265932800,,273,4.269230769230769
