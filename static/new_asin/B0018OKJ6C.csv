3418072,5,B0018OKJ6C,I had to order this DVD after my young daughter saw it at a friend's house and wanted one of her own. Now my daughter is teaching her little brother Spanish! Love it. Great for all ages. The music keeps the children engaged. Can't wait to see if there will be more in this series.,1210723200,3,280,4.109090909090909
3418073,5,B0018OKJ6C,"I love ""Frank and Paco"" video because it targets to the beginning of a child's vocabulary.  It is engaging for little ones and for adults too.
I like the grammatical information that the DVD provides (easy to select from the menu).",1210464000,3,231,4.634146341463414
3418074,5,B0018OKJ6C,My four-year old loves this video and sings along in both Spanish and English.  It really engages her attention and is introducing her to Spanish vocabulary.  I hope there will be follow-on videos that will focus on conversation!,1210377600,3,229,5.0
3418075,5,B0018OKJ6C,My sons fell in love with this DVD - they want to watch it over and over again.  My 3 year old loves singing along with the theme song and is already picking up some Spanish words after only a few viewings.  We will definitely be purchasing the future volumes as they come out.  I recommend this for parents who want their kids to have fun and be entertained as they learn.,1210204800,3,373,4.152777777777778
3418076,5,B0018OKJ6C,"This DVD is a real groundbreaker when it comes to finding tools to teach our children new language skills...and entertaining, too! My granddaughter and nieces and nephews enjoy it tremendously and are hilarious when they sing along.",1210204800,4,232,5.297297297297297
3418077,5,B0018OKJ6C,"Our 2 year old can't say ""Frank and Paco"" yet but he asks for this DVD by name, calling it ""Pagu""!

He's a little young to pick up on the Spanish, but he loves the bright colors and happy music.  And he matches the English words he does know with the images on the screen: ""Milk,"" ""Eat,"" ""Fruit,"" and so on.

An extra bonus on this DVD is that, after it ends, it starts right over from the beginning.  So we adults don't have to keep selecting ""Play"" from the menu!!

I give this DVD five stars!",1210204800,4,495,4.061855670103093

8270366,4,B0018OKJ6C,"I don't agree with some of the reviews that says it does not get attention from kids older than 2 years old. My daughter watches it over and over and repeats the words. Because she can read in two languages by now, she reads the words and it helps. I bought it at a lower price at some famous toy store after I bought one expensive one (the Whistlefritz Spanish for beginners) from amazon. It is impossible for a toddler or a kid to learn Spanish from the previous one that I bough from amazon. It doesn't show the word, there is this little mouse and the narrator for example is looking for the mouse. She calls it and probably asks where he is, but even I do not understand or clearly hear what she says or what exactly she asks. I am a teacher but I am not teaching language. I was never good at learning foreign language either. It may be right that in order to learn a foreign language you must hear it and must not use your mother language. I get it because English is not my mother language and that's what some teachers used to teach English to me. However, I would still like to hear and see what the narrator is talking about. So, picturing what's going on or at least visualizing it helps to me. My daughter did not like the previous dvd at all. The fact is that someone is speaking in a language about which you have no idea and it is on DVD, not someone near you, so you never exactly know what is going on there. Think how boring it is.
She likes this one though. Actually, we all like it, and we sit down in front of the TV and watch it as a family. We have no idea about Spanish, but we have learned some basic and simple stuff already. I agree that the idea that two puppets teaching something bothered me when I was buying the DVD, because the puppet thing is old fashioned and may not be attractive for kids (if the puppet is not Elmo or Abby:)) I also agree that the DVD is not really fun or entertaining. That's because that's not what it aims. But in my opinion, it uses a better way of teaching for those who really know nothing about Spanish, at least for us. Well, you can never expect a kid to sit and enjoy and educating DVD alone for a long time whatever the topic is. You must enjoy it with her or him, too, so that you encourage her or him. That;s what we do and we like it. I will definitely buy the second chapter of this DVD.",1293494400,,2358,4.106060606060606
8270367,2,B0018OKJ6C,My daughter did not like this DVD.  It is really cheaply made.  It sounds like they used a computer generated voice to say the spanish pronunciations.  We had fun repeating the monotone voice.  But I am guessing that is not the point of the DVD.  It is really bad.  Save your money and let your child watch a small amount of TV in Spanish.,1251158400,,339,4.21875
8270368,5,B0018OKJ6C,"Both my 2-year-old and 5-year-old love this video.  My 5-year-old now speaks his Spanish with an ""accent"" like the video.  Very easy for him to pick up.  Sweet and simple.",1235952000,2,171,4.633333333333334
8270369,5,B0018OKJ6C,"I was so disappointed to see such a negative review come up when talking about the Frank and Paco series.  I found many opposites when I viewed this with video with my nieces and nephews.  They took to it so quickly!  They were singing songs, dancing and saying words immediately after the video.  And, what's not to love about a Texas accent--friendly, welcoming and easy to understand!

8270370,5,B0018OKJ6C,"Below is some direct feedback from a friend who received Frank and Paco as a gift from us.

""My girls give it a thumbs up.
They viewed it first on the way back from Houston, and were disappointed that rather than being able to watch Toy Story 2 , they were going to be subjected to an ""educational"" video.

After the first couple of minutes tho, I heard both of them engaging in the participatory parts of the video. I mention both girls since as you know, Trinity being 6 and Isabella 3, their attention/attraction to videos tends to vary significantly. For purposes of this review then, I concluded that it does a good job of engaging a notable range in age focus.

Content and Format:

I found the content basic but solid (as it should be for an introduction to any language) and the format seems to engage the little viewers. I should mention that I have observed my 3 year old to be hesitant to engage in participatory parts of such leading videos like Dora the Explorer"" but observed her readily participating during Frank and Paco. This too I found of relevance to the review as verbal participation is key to cementing language skills.

I also conclude that the length is appropriate as both my girls remained engaged for the duration of the video (I have observed them ""tune out"" on longer leading programs).

Quality of Spanish

I definitely see the effort put in the use ""international"" Spanish (Castellano) as opposed to regionalized. I believe this is the right approach as it this is the Spanish that is understood across the Spanish speaking world and in business and broadcasting.""

8270371,3,B0018OKJ6C,"For this type of dvd (translation as opposed to immersion), I think they did a good job. It was nice to hear native Spanish speakers which I think is very important for children to be exposed to when learning a new language.

I liked the Rapid Review option at the end. It's a good way to go over the vocabulary without going through the entire dvd. Also, the grammar explanations will be quite helpful to monolingual parents who want to introduce Spanish to their children. That was impressive to me.

On the other hand, I still think there was too much English in my opinion. Also, I think it would've have been nice if Paco the rooster had been more lively. He talked in a monotone voice.

My 5 year old son said he enjoyed it, but hasn't asked to see it again. My eight year old was less than enthusiastic about it.",1217548800,7,819,4.339869281045751
8270372,5,B0018OKJ6C,"I thought this video was excellent.  My daughter is 5 years old.  After she watched this video for the first time she began calling her little brother ""hermano"" without prompting.  She found it entertaining and very easy to understand and follow.  What was ideal was the repetitive words in both english and spanish.  I speak spanish but my husband does not.  I found this DVD very helpful in validating what I am trying to teach her at home.  I cannot wait for the next follow up video.",1217203200,2,487,4.528735632183908
8270373,1,B0018OKJ6C,"I'm always looking for new ways to keep my kids (ages 5 and 7) interested in learning Spanish.  Based on the glowing reviews for this DVD, I was hoping for a lot more.

First, the Let's Learn Spanish with Frank and Paco says it is intended for children ages 2-10.  It will definitely NOT hold the attention of kids above the age of 2.  The main characters are hand puppets in the shape of horse and chicken (Frank and Paco).  All the visual elements look amateur and children nowadays will not be impressed.

If by some strange chance it does hold your child's attention, whether anything will be learned is doubtful.  Most educators recommend immersion or near-immersion as the most effective technique for teaching children a foreign language. The main language in this DVD is English (around 80%).  The Spanish is taught as standalone words or phrases that are repeated after the English.  They are not put in use so we don't learn how these words are used in actual conversation. Furthermore, the Spanish is not always clear because 1) sound quality is not good and 2) words are repeated by a group of children and/or young child who pronounces the word in an awkward fashion.

The format is extremely repetitive and tiresome. It goes like this: the annoying narrator (a horse hand puppet with a Texas twang) introduces the word in English, and then the chicken hand puppet says the word in Spanish. A woman pops up and asks in English ""How do you say (word) in Spanish"" and is answered by children's voices. This continues for the entire length of the video.

Finally, there's a song at the end of the DVD which reviews the words.  It's probably one of the most obnoxious songs I've heard in a while (think old western tune with poor rhyming).  In summary, this DVD is just awful.  There are much better products in the market.",1216598400,31,1832,4.631578947368421
8270374,5,B0018OKJ6C,My kids love this. They have watched it many times and have learned all the Spanish words already. Great product.,1210723200,4,113,4.7
