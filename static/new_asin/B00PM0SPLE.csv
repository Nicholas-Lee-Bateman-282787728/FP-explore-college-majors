6818118,5,B00PM0SPLE,"My girls love Doc. This DVD contains five episodes from the Disney Jr. cartoon. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. My Huggy Valentine / Dusty Bear - Lambie is jealous of new toy Val and Teddy B. is sad when Donny doesn't play with him.
2. Awesome Guy's Awesome Arm / Lamb in A Jam - Awesome Guy hurts his arm and Lambie gets sticky jam all over her.
3. Kirby And The King / Bubble Monkey, Blow Your Nose! - The Wicked King and Sir Kirby get glued together and Bubble Monkey sneezes soap everywhere.
4. A Day Without Cuddles! / Collide-o-scope - International Cuddle Day is almost ruined and Kiara the kaleidoscope gets a bump on her head.
5. Mirror, Mirror On My Penguin / Hide And Eek! - Waddly's mirror tummy gets dirty and a new toy monster scares the other toys.",1422316800,25,857,4.257668711656442
