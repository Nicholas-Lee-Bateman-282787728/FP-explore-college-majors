8244868,4,B00129FES6,The Raymond Burr video is a classic used by the USN for reference. Great summary of USN small boat operations. The individual clips give a good picture of life aboard PBR's. Good addition to your library of the Viet Nam conflict.,1306368000,,229,4.609756097560975
8244869,4,B00129FES6,"This is one of the best collection of videos I have ever seen for the brown water navy, especially the PBR's. Give you a glimpse into a rare and little known part of the U.S. Navy. The only thing I could complain about at all is that this video came on DVD but the case the DVD is in is a cheap clear plastic case with no label or picture. I would have hoped to have seen a better case and label but no big deal. I just created my own from old pictures I have.",1262822400,,460,3.8020833333333335
