8346509,5,B001VJ390C,"In 2007 Historical Productions released the movie Johnny The True Story of a Civil War Legend starring Cody Piper in the role of Johnny Lincoln (Shiloh) Clem. The movie is filmed in a documentary narrative way with many U.S. Civil War reenactments. The movie is filled with interesting information and tidbits of what life was like as a Union soldier. By using actual photos the viewer gets a new understanding of how this horrible war caused so much pain.
I highly recommend seeing this film, as I remember seeing Walt Disney's ""Johnny Shiloh"" starring Kevin Corocran and being fascinated by the story. Johnny is a wonderful movie of the courage, determination and the love of his country a young boy had.

8346512,5,B001VJ390C,"As a young Captain, I was stationed at Rickenbacker AFB, Columbus, Ohio (now Ohio ANG) and Newark AF Station, in Newark Ohio.  Young Cody Piper who acted in the role and narrative of ""Johnny Joseph 'Lincoln' Clem is superior; he is exceptional and gifted.  Any boy can relate to him.  I am the descendant of those
who were blue and gray as soldiers in the Civil War. On both sides, there were thousands of boys who were in uniform for both the South and the North as couriers and drummer boys. This DVD documentary emphasized how Officers both North and South were chivalrous with such youth; Officers both North and South, sent those young boys back to their own lines rather than hold them in prison?!  Johnny Clem was born in Newark, Ohio, and ran away to serve in the Union Army.
This narrative separates myth or legend from fact. True, Johnny Clem went to join the 22nd Michigan Vol. Infantry, and, despite opposition from Officers, he struggled and prevailed due to his exceptional behavior and character to be accepted by the men in the regiment.  He was in terrible battles such as Chickamauga, and was stationed with his regiment in Nashville, Tennessee. This is a heroic story of a boy who was not born into social or economic privilege, but struggled by his own merit and accomplishments to prevail despite disease, death, destruction in the American Civil War. Whether Boy or Man, Girl or Woman,
the viewer shall benefit from this documentary of a boy who became a national hero and a true-to-life legend in his own life time. In his adult life he became
a General Officer in the U.S. military.  There is another excellent feature in this DVD.  I have been to several civil war re-enactments for battles and history.  Always, I am left with the unrelenting disturbance about Americans killing Americans, which this DVD does not glorify at all. Johnny Clem as an Adult, met the Adult Southern Officer whom he wounded in battle as a boy. In adult life, both of them became good friends.  This DVD is outstanding!",1381363200,,2022,4.6892655367231635
8346513,5,B001VJ390C,I found this DVD when looking for another DVD.  It's a great story about the history of the United States.  Thanks.,1368057600,,115,4.428571428571429
8346514,3,B001VJ390C,"This is a credible first effort by indy movie makers.  Their choice of the Johnny Clem story was smart and the videography was very well done.  As an indy Civil War video maker myself, I appreciate all the challenges of trying to make a ""war movie"" on a miniscule production budget.  I would respectfully and constructively suggest that in their next production actors and the narrator should slow down delivery of their lines.  As a viewer, I felt ""rushed"" by the voiceovers.  Hopefully, they make enough from this first effort, or obtain enough sponsorship, to acquire field audio gear that will enable less use of voiceovers.  Also, the use of green screen came off as too obvious in a couple spots.  I'm not sure it was even needed in those spots to support the story line.  But overall, it was a noble first effort and we encourage our kindred spirits at Historical Productions, Inc. to press on with more productions.  Indy rules!",1255996800,4,936,4.728395061728395
