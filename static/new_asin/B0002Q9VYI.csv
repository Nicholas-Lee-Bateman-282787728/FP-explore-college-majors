2115813,3,B0002Q9VYI,"The Popotan anime seems to be one of those series where the makers assumes that the viewer has played the game as well as read the novels or manga. That's not to say that the basic storyline of the anime isn't clear, but I couldn't help but feel like there was something I was missing out on. (The original games were sexually oriented & while you can sort of tell that from the oodles of fanservice, that's really not what the ""something missing"" seems to be in this anime.)

Popotan follows the adventures of three sisters & their maid as they travel through time in their mansion to various places in Japan in the hopes of finding a mysterious person. In each location they meet new friends as well as new problems to help solve. However, they never seem to be any closer to finding that special person...

The series is very cute & the animation is fairly decent. The animation does seem to occasionally lack in certain areas, most notably when it surrounds a character that isn't a cute or handsome. The three sisters & their maid are the most detailed of any, which is to be expected- after all, they're who the viewer is wanting to see. There's a lot of filler here, with the real meat of the story taking up only a fifth of this twelve episode series.

Something I do have to warn potential viewers on is that there's LOTS of fanservice in here, with all four of the main characters appearing naked. It can be a little overwhelming on occasion, what with some of the fanservice seeming a little over the top. Plus I also have to warn you that some of it is loli fanservice- I know some people don't like watching it, so I thought I should mention it. However, none of it is really all that sexual in nature & most of it is pretty innocently done. It's just that once in a while I was just confused as to why it was necessary- at one point in the later episodes a character stands up & drops trou for no apparent reason other than to be naked. Rather than being erotic,sensual or even cute, it just seemed a little ridiculous & I longed for fanservice with more style. I emphasise all of this because the type of fanservice given in this series just seems to be at odds with how the series was trying to portray itself as. It just didn't match up & felt a little out of place.

It's just that in the end this seemed to just be a little lackluster. The original games & novels supposedly included a love interest & I can't help but feel like the series would have been strengthened if that love interest had been kept with the anime or if more of the backstory from the games had been included. (An adult romance game shouldn't remove the love interest when adapting it to other formats.) This anime isn't terrible, but like some of the other animes I've reviewed it is more of a rental title than something I'd really recommend purchasing straight off.",1275264000,10,2859,4.378531073446328
2115814,5,B0002Q9VYI,"This is the first disk in a three-disk series, and the first four episodes mainly set up the series and introduce the characters. The first episode centers on Ai, the older sister, the second on Mai, the second sister, the third on Mii, the third sister, and the fourth on Mea, their robot maid. These four episodes are a little weak because of the ""intro"" being spread out over four episodes, but the whole series needs to be viewed to appreciate the emotional depth of the storyline. The story suffers from confusion over who the series is targeted to. It has major elements of a little girl ""Magical Girl"" series, but there is too much ""fan service"" for a young audience to appreciate. Then again, it has major elements of a hentai or lolicon series, but the ""fan service"" are too light hearted and innocent for the anime to fall into that category.  In the end, it is the emotional depth of the series that rescues the work. Few other anime reach into such depths of feeling - only Grave of the Fireflies tugged at my heart strings harder. If you are expecting a kids anime, watch this first before showing it to your kids. If you are expecting a hentai series, you will be disappointed. And keep in mind that the whole series forms an entire story arc - if you only watch these first four episodes and give up on Popotan you will be missing a treat. The animation and voice acting are first rate and the stories are wonderful. I suspect that this will be a series that people will either love or hate, with no middle ground.",1181347200,4,1529,4.4412811387900355
2115815,5,B0002Q9VYI,"I bought this anime on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised to find Popotan to be much more than it appeared to be at first glance. Popotan has a great storyline! That is of course in addition to the fan-service and comedy. I have watched a lot of anime in my time, and honestly Popotan has by far the best story I have ever seen crammed into 12 short episodes. For that alone, I strongly reccomend Popotan for anyone who wants a fun and enjoyable Anime.

If that's not enough for you however, Popotan also has hilarious comedy in every episode and some steamy fan-service. Please note there is a lot of nudity in this show, but none of it is sexual. They managed to do a scene with the girls bathing in almost every episode!

Again, I strongly reccomend Popotan for everyone who can handle a little nudity, wonderful characters, brilliant storyline, good music and funny circumstances. Buy Popotan now!",1179100800,2,903,4.60248447204969

2115836,3,B0002Q9VYI,"This Japanese Anime is typical of the Japanese output of he last 30 years.

A cynical yet fresh look at life and relationships, from the standpoint of a fa,ily of three sisters (ranging in age from 10 or so, to 20 something), who time travel in an old house, and spend a brief period interacting with the locals, while the oldest sister Ai, communicates with the local flowers (called Popotan, a nonsensical word in Japanese) to seek information related to their ""quest"" (we never learn what that quest is or who gave it to them).

This is not suitable for kids under 14 or so, but if well supervised with an adult watching with them, the only issues are that there is some nudity and  mild sexual references, There is little violence other than an occasional outburst, and no one gets hurt.

The series only runs 1 season (12 episodes), and I must admit, I was feeling let down. The plot is very appealing on an emotional level, but all logic goes out the window too.

For more mature pre-teens, teens with a sense of humor, and adults who are still kids at heart,

2115863,4,B0002Q9VYI,"Note: Might contain spoilers.  Please read at your own discretion.

I'm a fan of anime since way back and I like it kind of light and funny (or at least with tastefully done violence ala Ghost in the Shell), with some eye-candy thrown in here and there.  This show isn't always light and funny, and it has a LOT of (non-sexually based) nudity, but the storyline was unusually compelling for something that seemed so fluffy to begin with.

The story centers around Ai, Mii and Mai, sisters in a house that seems to be part living quarters, part Christmas advertisement.  It travels from place to place, jumping through time as well.  The main theme to it seems to be that the sisters are on a ""quest"" to find a particular woman.  Why they're doing that isn't mentioned.  Along the way, they make friends with, and then have to leave, a lot of people - which as others have noted drives the drama in the story.  A man named Kiet (or Kieth - hard to tell) serves as a moody and arrogant protagonist/""guide"" while Mae serves as the sister's (probably cybernetic) guardian/maid.  (Who, oddly, was MY favorite character.)

If one can overlook the unexplained reason for the sisters being on the quest in the first place the series is relatively engaging.  It's only 13 episodes long and has an ending that could lend itself to more should they ever go about doing it.

But the main thing I want to point out is that once you get it, you can watch it through Amazon's streaming video service.  Unfortunately, the aspect ratio is messed up in the streaming side (and yes, I tried all different ones to get it to be correct).  This isn't the fault of the show.  It's a fault of Amazon for not checking the aspect ratios of its streaming service (It's not a problem on Netflix, but Popotan isn't available on their streaming as of this writing).  So if you have Prime and watched the show and aren't getting the DVD's because the aspect ratio is messed up, I expect the DVD's are probably OK.  A lot of Amazon's streaming anime shows have really awful aspect ratios for some reason.  This makes some of them just plain unwatchable (Not so much for this show).  But both Japan and America have the same video standards, so a DVD should be fine.

Four stars because of the lack of reasonably clear explanation behind the motivation for the sisters being on the quest in the first place.  Since staying on the quest was the reason for all the drama in the show, it would have been nice to know what was really compelling them to complete it besides (from all appearances) stubborn curiosity.  Otherwise it would have been five stars.",1373846400,4,2620,4.539445628997868

But the constant priority given to boob-meat and risque situations would seem to be aimed squarely at the lonely male 20 sumthins. I guess only a select few anime creators can (or even want) to bypass their cultures obsessive need to be perverted when making shows anymore. Honestly I'm not sure why they even bother with it, their fans would make and sell their own home brew porn of the characters within minutes anyway.

2115875,5,B0002Q9VYI,"Hello Everyone,

Highly recommended. Wonderful story, sentimental.

At first the nudity seems gratuitous, but after a while the way this family of young women holds important conferences in the large bath becomes part of their story as an extremely close-knit, emotional relationship between sisters.

Near the end of the series, when the overall plot becomes forefront, the nudity in these scenes actually becomes irrelevant.  The discussions in which they try to decide their individual futures are cases in point.

I suppose you could call this a harem anime with an actual plot. Not only does the plot elevate it far above the usual harem story - there's no middle-school male idiot anywhere in sight.  With the exception of the requisite bad guy, the men and boys in this series, even if they start out a little on the smarmy side, eventually develop into thoughtful, mature individuals.  They're certainly a lot less smarmy than that last sentence, anyway.

There's been a little confusion about the language options in this release by Sentai.  At least one Amazon reviewer has reported that it's Japanese audio with English subtitles only, no English dubbing.

I just received a copy of Popotan from Sentai's store at Rightstuf.com The back of the case is the same as the image shown in this Amazon product description. For languages it says: ""Audio: Japanese 2.0, Subtitles: English"".  There's no indication that it's been dubbed in English.

However, when I played the first disc, there was a ""Languages"" menu item with the following options: ""Japanese with English Subtitles"" and ""English"". English was selected by default, and the characters were all speaking English.  I also noticed English subtitles for Japanese labels and signs, such as mailboxes and storefronts.

So it IS dubbed in spoken English, with English subtitles for Japanese text (nice touch), even though the DVD case doesn't indicate it. For those who still prefer spoken Japanese with English subtitles, that option is available too.  You can have it both ways.

Here's the pertinent data:

Hope this info helps resolve the languages issue,

If you check that person's other reviews, she seem to randomly pick anime releases and complain about a lack of dub, even when there is one.  In this case, just like her ""review"" of Kurokami, there is a dub.  In fact, it's a fairly competent one.  It's not one of the best I've heard, but far from the worse.

As for the show, it's a lot of mindless fun.  Don't go in expecting a deep plot and significant character development and you should enjoy it.  The show is simply fun and that's about it.  It's also got quite a bit of fan service, if you're into that.",1316995200,,619,4.186440677966102
