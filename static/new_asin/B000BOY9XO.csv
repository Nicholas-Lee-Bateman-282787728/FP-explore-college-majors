8090312,5,B000BOY9XO,"'Black Arrow' is based on the classic Robert Louis Stevenson adventure tale. Stephen Chase plays the title character, a good-doing and heroic swashbuckler who tries to avenge his father's murder during the War of the Roses, a series of wars for control of the throne of England fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: the House of Lancaster (associated with a red rose), and the House of York (whose symbol was a white rose), a conflict that lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, and slightly before and after this period between the two houses.

The Stevenson original was previously adapted for the screen in 1948, with Louis Hayward in the lead. 'Black Arrow' made its TV debut on January 6, 1985. Character-actor Donald Pleasence cast as Oates; Oliver Reed starring as Sir Daniel Brackley and Fernando Rey starring as the Earl of Warwick, to name but a few in a great cast. Though Stephan Chase as Black Arrow carries the bulk of the action, top billing is bestowed upon the film's villains, Oliver Reed (as Sir Daniel Brackley) and Fernando Rey (as the Earl of Warwick).

You will find no spoilers in this review. For more details of the story line, please see the Plot Summary or Synopsis.

I found this film to be a rare, interesting, and very entertaining glimpse into 15th century medieval life in England in general, and the conflict of the War of the Roses specifically.

Produced for cable TV by The Disney Channel, it was not a big budget production, but it more than effectively suffices in its story in the swashbuckler and adventure genre, offering several well-done, historically-accurate action scenes including an action-packed finale.

Definitely worth seeing; great acting and replete with action, drama, and historically accurate costumes and weaponry of that era.",1487808000,,1852,5.0

8090316,5,B000BOY9XO,"As a younger girl I adored this film.  It was high quality, great acting, great costumes, a lot of adventure (a la Stevenson), and romance.  I watched it over and over again.  It bothers me that I can't share this with my own daughter now.  We no longer have a VHS player, and the prices are growing higher and higher for the old copies as is.

Come on Disney.  Can't you accomodate anybody with your film sales?  What is with the delayed releases and non-releases?",1314403200,,465,4.4
8090317,5,B000BOY9XO,"STORY: Not to be confused with the 1948 film starring Louis Hayward. Set during the English War of the Roses between the Houses of York and Lancaster. The Black Arrow is actually a character in the film (Stephen Chase), a Robin Hood-like swashbuckling archer with his own group of supporters. In the story, a rich and powerful English Lord with the York faction, the Sir Daniel Brackley (Oliver Reed in a stellar performance), is tyrannizing the peasants and plotting to manipulate the fates of a woman, the Lady Joanna (Georgia Slowe)that is supposed to be in his care as a ward or pupil.  His plans include theft of her property, and forcing her to marry. The Lord is helped by his toadie Sir Oliver Oates (Donald Pleasance). Only the Black arrow can stop them but Brackley has branded him an outlaw and wants him dead. Terrific action fight scenes, fun for all ages.

TRIVIA & BEHIND THE SCENES: Directed by John Hough. This made for television movie was produced by Walt Disney Studios, and aired for the first time on ""The Disney Channel"" on January 6, 1985. It was quickly released to the VHS rental market later in the same year, and most copies available are former rentals. Since it has not been re-released in 25 years, copies can get pricey. The screenplay was written by David Pursall and Peter Welbeck, based on the classic adventure book from 1888 by Robert Luis Stevenson, who wrote Treasure Island, and Kidnapped.  Filmed on location in Spain.  The exciting musical score was composed by Stanley Myers for the film. 90 minutes long.
Terrific action fight scenes, fun for all ages.",1270771200,5,1596,4.750902527075812
8090318,2,B000BOY9XO,"It's hard to believe that Disney could miss the mark as much as they did on this one.  Even with the great cast.  The book, 'The Black Arrow' is fantastic and I recomend it for fantasy, adventure and English history (War of the Roses) readers.

What disney did with the story is uncomprehensible and is the reason, I'm sure, that this movie by such a big studio is of such little reknown.

My suggestion is to pass on this movie and read the book!  This is especially true if you have read the book already...just read it again.  You aren't missing anything and you'll only be disappointed.

Best wishes and better adventures,

8090319,4,B000BOY9XO,"Black Arrow is another great classic and by today's standards, not a flashy movie but when it was released it was at the top of Disney's game. Once again a great writer of stories from childhood days has his story brought to life by skilled movie makers.",1232323200,2,254,4.425531914893617
8090320,5,B000BOY9XO,"I never thought I would buy another movie on VHS, but I made an acception with the Black Arrow. I had taped it off the Disney Channel many years ago and it was accidentally taped over. I was hoping to someday see it on DVD, but with not much luck in that direction, I was glad to be able to purchase this copy on VHS.  It is a wonderful  movie, full of action, treachery and a touch of romance.  If you like sword fights, crossbows and jolly old England, you'll love Black Arrow.
