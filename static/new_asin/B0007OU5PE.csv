They told me they did not and they only had the one VHS tape. I returned to the museum about once a year, taking friends, relatives, and international exchange students to see it. Every time I watched this video it gave me chills. After the museum closed (artifacts were moved to Kalamazoo to a new museum) I started searching the internet to find the video. Finally I located it, paid the $29 and have been happy to finally own it.  I continue to show it to others every chance I get.

It is only about 15 minutes in length, but it is very powerful, very inspirational, and priceless!",1202342400,2,713,4.313432835820896
