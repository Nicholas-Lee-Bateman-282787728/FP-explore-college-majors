4262867,5,B0045HKF1I,"This movie is done in the documentary style of ""First Decent "", but does a much better job of holding your attention and respect for the players. The cinematography is quite good as well; though there isn't much difference between BD and standard DVD on this one. Overall, this is definitely worth watching and gives you an appreciation for what Jeremy Jones is trying to accomplish.",1330732800,3,383,4.818181818181818
4262868,5,B0045HKF1I,"I hope that Deeper starts a new trend in shred videos. What makes Deeper unique is that it offers the viewer a chance to see some amazing big mountain riding without having to sit through the usual embarrassing, self-indulgent, 10 minute long slow-mo montages of helicopters filming snowmobiles, helicopters filming other helicopters, etc. that you usually see in the big mountain videos. None of that stuff here. The riders in Deeper earn their turns, hiking and camping deep into the wilderness to get some of the most amazing lines ever captured on video. This video will really appeal to people that have a love for the mountains and enjoy things like mountaineering and backpacking in addition to snowboarding. But it also opens up a whole new world to all snowboarders, and sends an awesome new message to your average shred: you can find and crush epic lines, even right here in the lower 48, without the international flights, chartered helis and sleds that only pro-bros can swing...if you're willing to take on the hard work and research that it takes to get out there.

I don't want to dis anyone that loves to get out on the snow in any fashion. But there are a lot of different kinds of riders out there, and it is nice to see some much needed variety in shred videos to reflect that. It is great to see a big mountain snowboard video that isn't just a Warren Miller rip off, or (worse) a self indulgent fantasy of technology ogling and European alpine luxury to live vicariously through. Those videos are satisfying in their own way, but snowboarding is a diverse culture and we all benefit from there being more options out there. I hope Jeremy Jones is making Deeper 2 as I type, and I hope others will make more ""earn your turns in uncharted territory"" videos...and many other new styles too.",1297382400,12,1809,4.670846394984326
4262869,5,B0045HKF1I,"I received this movie in the mail and was awestruck with the cover, so much so that i shed a single tear of joy, placed the movie on my T.V. for one weeks time and prayed that i was worthy to watch it.  Turns out i am, i think, so yeah this movie is freakin awesome, so much more than just your typical snowboard movie. It is truly an in depth look at what it takes to pull of a big mtn expedition, with all the climbing and hiking and camping.  On a serious note, more than 170 babies a year are effected by Infant restless leg syndrome and we need to be working to find a way to forget about them, or at least block them from our thoughts.  I haven't written many reviews and i feel like the first time my mom let me stay out all night,  btw this review was typed while i was drinking a beer in the shower.  MOMS NOT HERE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT",1293926400,5,848,3.878612716763006
4262870,5,B0045HKF1I,"If your a fan of skiing, or snowboarding alike, you'll love this movie.  Jeremy Jones takes snowboarding to a whole new level in this film.  With segments in Utah, Chamonix, and Alaska, this 2 year TGR project is exciting and awe inspiring.  The movie has spectacular mountain views and places that have never been seen in a ski film before. You'll be on the edge of your seat from the very beginning.  This is not your typical ski movie with Terrain park jumps and Helicopters.  Jeremy Jones, Travis Rice, et al. hike every single one of lines, many times with technical mixed climbing gear like ice axes, crampons, and rope.  So if your looking for crazy ski lines with un-tracked powder and good music.  Definitely buy this DVD/Blue-ray.",1293494400,2,740,4.734375
4262871,4,B0045HKF1I,"This movie was okay...there is some old footage that is in terrible quality that through off the whole BluRay experience. But since it has Jeremy Jones in it that makes it watchable.

Thanks to ""Gaper"" for correcting me. I knew it was Jeremy Jones, ""Damn you autocorrect."" I have ""That's It That's All"" on BluRay also and the quality surpasses this in leaps and bounds. However I will give one more star due to how awesome the riders are in this movie.",1293408000,3,452,4.512195121951219
4262872,5,B0045HKF1I,"As opposed to several boarding flicks out there, Deeper delivers the goods in spades. Finally here's one that inspires us to get out there, push the limits, and make things happen.  Well, OK, I'm probably going to make it happen on resort terrain around the Lake this year...but the footage contained in Deeper was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Who wouldn't want to get away from the mechanized lifts, head out into the backcountry, bust hump all day long, slog up some of the committing terrain for one epic run after seeing this film?  You will absolutely get vertigo as Jones or one of his buds peer over an insane face and drops on some of the biggest terrain this planet has to offer.  God, I wished this flick would never end...  Jones is an unassuming visionary for our sport, and one of the very few celebs I would probably gush over if I ever get the chance to meet him.  If you've never heard of the guy, Deeper shows you what he's all about...from his ""Protect Our Winters"" movement, to his riding, to his board company.  Here's wishing Jeremy Jones many more happy winters!",1386460800,,1075,4.510309278350515

4262874,5,B0045HKF1I,Takes backcountry riding to the next level. Intense stuff being up on the mountain for almost a month. This sport is becoming legendary.,1380240000,,136,4.956521739130435

4262877,5,B0045HKF1I,"Just amazing what these guys are out there doing. This isn't a park or big mountain free style sick tricks kinda vid, thou Travis Rice does provide some of that. More its a collage of crazy, one mistake gets u killed kinda lines in the most secluded mountain ranges in the world. Awesome. They hike, rope n scale, Splitboard ski to every summit and shred it back down.",1358121600,,368,4.426470588235294

4262879,4,B0045HKF1I,"It's a mountain climbing video with snowboarding.
I really enjoyed it and will buy ""Further"" as well.

The climb and ride approach is inspiring and adds a lot to the film

Nice mix of telephoto and POV filming.  The POV shows just how desperate some of the lines were.
None of the brilliant aerial steady cam in Art of Flight, but the old school telephoto is well done and is in line with the self support ethic of the project.  You also get a better sense of scale with the long shots.  The lines they are riding are HUGE!",1353715200,,523,4.242424242424242
4262880,5,B0045HKF1I,I like documentary style films rather than just pure action which can get stale after awhile.  This was right up there with First Descent as my favorite snowboarding movies.,1337040000,,173,4.9655172413793105
4262881,5,B0045HKF1I,"Classic Jeremy Jones, always bigger and better. This is well worth the money. If you like back country, powder, and EXTREME you will like this.",1334102400,2,143,4.76

8416695,5,B0045HKF1I,It is an excellent movie about big mountain snowboarding but responsible use of fossil fuel and earning your turns. Jeremy Jones is an inspiring athlete who does not seem effected by his fame and success.,1388620800,,204,4.857142857142857
