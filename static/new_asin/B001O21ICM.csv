Given the stellar cast, and the somewhat unusual plot, the acting could have been a lot less melodramatic.",1344124800,,250,4.340425531914893

3725763,1,B001O21ICM,"This movie had been panned everywhere and most gave it a 2 out of 10. I thought I'd risk it as they said teens might like it, the lead was know for his music and he had a vaguely cute look on the cover - and it was a reincarnation story which are interesting. This time it seems I have to concede their lack of connection with this movie.
Two of us of different age-groups sat to watch it and both decided to ditch it after 30 or so minutes. The lead was lacking charisma and the plot and direction seemed awkward.
The reincarnation flashback was sort of flooded through in a rush . He then landed somewhere on holiday in a helicopter without batting an eyelash when his past life death was going down in a plane and he was meant to be having flashbacks. Om Shanti Om handled this infinitely better as a theme - check that out instead if you haven't already.
The music seemed very repetitious and flat, and the lead didn't seem to dance much either. He seemed to be balancing a Beatles-look wig precariously as the new rock star self so that his 'Mum' seemed careful when brushing his head so as not to dislodge it - odd!
Hard to know what to rate something you couldn't finish so will just make it a '1'",1234051200,,1204,4.216450216450217
8328818,1,B001O21ICM,"The summary sounded interesting but we have to wonder if it is accurate. After a seemingly interminable time of musicals, singing, more music, singing, dance numbers, we gave up for it did not appear that the promising beginning was going anywhere. Not only that, but the point about the love interest was made and then made and then made again. Indeed, it seems as though the movie is a talent showcase. If the summary is accurate, guess we didn't have the staying power.",1453939200,,472,4.698795180722891

8328826,4,B001O21ICM,"I really do not think anyone would confuse the two. haha

My friend suggested this movie to me because I am such a fan of Om Shanti Om. If you have seen that one, this one has a similar storyline. This is an older movie, so the effects can be cheesy, but that is part of what made it so endearing to me. I genuinely enjoyed this movie more than most. If you do not like Bollywood movies, or reincarnation stories, then it might not be for you. But, I think unless you are totally against Bollywood films and/or reincarnation stories you will still enjoy it.",1372982400,,557,4.254716981132075
8328827,4,B001O21ICM,"It's a thrilling story of re-incarnation. I love the songs of the movie composed by great duo Laxmikant  Pyarelal especially ""Om Shanti Om"", ""ek haseena thi"" and ""Dard e Dil"". Rishi Kapoor is awesome. Simi Grewal is convincing.",1372723200,,227,4.973684210526316
