2804323,4,B000OYCMLM,"I saw this back in January of 2007 or perhaps it was last fall in '06, and the director attended the screening and answered questions afterwards. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was very well done in a self aware, wink to the audience, breaking the fourth wall kind of way. Very funny for the first half or two thirds of the movie as a film crew follows ""Leslie Vernon"" around, documenting why and how a serial killer/slasher does what he does. There were so many in-jokes for fans of the genre, you won't be disappointed, it's very funny.
  Around two thirds of the way thru the film, the director switches gears and actually turns the movie from mockumentary into straight forward slasher flick, no more shaky camera work or wise-cracking. As the killer has set things up for the viewer in the documentary portion, you figure you know what's going to happen once the killing begins, but not so! There are still plenty of surprises left in store!
  Nathan Baesel as the title character is the perfect mix of humorous, spastic, and creepy as a wanna-be killer who idolizes the likes of Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers (who incidentally are all real live killers and not fictional creations in the context of this movie).  Baesel reminds me a bit of Jim Carrey. My friend who attended the movie with me and who dislikes Carrey disagreed on the similarity but still found Baesel's performance enjoyable as well.
  The movie has a different approach to it than other satires or homages to the slasher flick in that the movie worked better separating the serious portion of the film from the humorous element, in order to maximize both (or at least the humorous element). At least, I thought so. I'm not sure what this film would have turned out like had it been set up to mix the mockumentary portion with the ""live"" killing scenes - I think the humor would have needed to take a back seat to the action and overall the movie would have been less enjoyable?
  Bottom line, if you liked Scream for its mix of humor and horror, you'll like Behind the Mask, too. Just be prepared that you won't get humor and horror at the same time but rather one after the other.  I will be buying this one on DVD (and I don't generally buy a lot of movies).",1181865600,14,2273,4.521951219512195
2804324,5,B000OYCMLM,Best horror mockumentary ever. Nathan Baesel does an awesome job as Leslie Vernon. The film does a great job making a turn from dark comedy to straight out slasher film. Great cameos from horror icons. This is a must for all horror fans.,1181433600,7,237,4.534883720930233
2804325,4,B000OYCMLM,Let me just say that I heard about this movie early in the production and wanted to see it from the beginning.  First off don't go into it expecting anything and this movie will deliver.  There is something in it for everyone ... there is comedy and horror.  I think that fans of slashers will definitely get a kick out of the cameos in the movie and the way that they make fun of slashers the way Scream should of.  Overall a great movie with a great performance by the lead.  Run out and buy it!,1181260800,5,497,4.135416666666667
2804326,4,B000OYCMLM,"More like 3.75 stars.  This film works very well as the mockumentary style it portrays through the first two thirds.  There is some very funny stuff for horror fans with many references to all the 80's horror films many fans of the genre have grown up with.  The last third of the film is an ok attempt at a slasher movie which we knew was happening all along.  No need to go into anymore detail and ruin the experience.  Be sure to stay for the end credits to ""understand"" the full meaning of the subtitle...ha ha!!!  A worthy look behind/through this mask.",1180828800,6,558,4.421568627450981
2804387,2,B000OYCMLM,"The joke works quite well for about that long.  Instead of ending it there, though, they stretch the increasingly tedious joke part of the movie out to about an hour and then tack on another half hour of just a straight up mediocre, generic slasher movie.",1519430400,,255,4.543478260869565

2804394,5,B000OYCMLM,I usually hate mockumentaries and found footage horror.......but this was a funny and creative twist on the slasher movie. They play with horror movie tropes and add some great humor into it. The actor who plays Leslie Vernon was hilarious. Definitely worth the watch for any horror fan.,1516060800,,287,5.0
2804395,1,B000OYCMLM,Extremely boring and slow paced. Anything but clever. Generic 101. Avoid this at all costs. The poster art is the only thing redeeming.,1515974400,2,135,4.913043478260869

2804413,5,B000OYCMLM,..i thought it would be just kinda silly tongue n cheek humor like what we do in the shadows but it was clever with an interesting twist.. and hes quite likeable for a killer..,1502496000,,176,4.205882352941177
2804414,5,B000OYCMLM,"Brilliant. This movie manages to merge dark comedy with genuine suspense and horror. It is a take on the 1980s slasher horror genre, but it approaches it in an ingenious way. I will not spoil it: if you like Nightmare on Elm Street and the like, you will love this movie.",1500336000,3,271,4.333333333333333

2804430,5,B000OYCMLM,"I love this movie! My husband had to explain it to me before I wanted to watch it. I am glad that I did. It's funny to watch the ""mind"" or a serial killer in action, as well as the twist of the story. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to watch a ""scary"" movie with someone that may not be into the gore or regular movies. It's a very down to earth, honest movie.",1479772800,,372,3.844155844155844

2804433,5,B000OYCMLM,Great,1477612800,,5,5.0
2804434,4,B000OYCMLM,"Great twist on the oh-my-god-please-stop-using-found-footage trope - and the lead actor really makes the whole movie much more palatable.  In a word, he's awesome - you're not sure whether to love or hate him, trust or run from him... and honestly, it's best that way.  The common sense practicality with which this film handles our favorite american horror elements is off-putting and charming at the same time.  For chop hounds, no fear, once the blood starts, it runs freely - and yes, we still question the IQ of the main protagonists ala every 80s horror film ever.  Definitely worth a watch.

Watch if you liked: Tucker and Dale vs Evil (2010), Creep (2014), The Cabin in the Woods (2011)",1477526400,3,694,4.798319327731092

2804469,5,B000OYCMLM,fun spoof.  understands the genre.  good slasher flick.  fun not stupid like so many others manage to be.  Any slasher fan will love.  would've loved a young jim carey to be Leslie.,1476662400,,181,4.53125

2804473,2,B000OYCMLM,"Don't waste your time!!!!  Save your money and wait to watch for free.  Stupid documentary on a serial killer with news team following killer around and watching him set up a killing of several teens, etc.  Boring and predictable.

Just watched this.
I gave it 5 stars.
Refreshing!
A totally different take on the overplayed ""documentary horror"".
I almost canned it when I saw it was a documentary, but have it a try.
Really glad I did.
If you haven't seen it and you love all the cult classic slasher films from our childhood, this is a must.",1473552000,,345,4.242424242424242
2804476,2,B000OYCMLM,"Didn't like it. It's like some crappy tribute to Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St and other horror movies. Not scary and not really a horror movie. If you like movies where they a filming on shaky hand-helds then you watch them going back and watching the footage they filmed, then I supposed you might like this.",1473292800,,317,4.482758620689655
2804487,3,B000OYCMLM,I gave this 3 stars because it literally  didn't get good until the last 35 minutes. It took way to long to get interesting. But I think the end made up for the boredom... Mostly,1472169600,,178,4.085714285714285

2804492,5,B000OYCMLM,"I can't believe it took me ten years to discover this film. It's good. It's original. A comedic homage to horror movie cliches. As well as a thorough dissection of said cliches. It's reminiscent of Cabin in the Woods, only it came years before.",1466467200,,244,4.568181818181818
2804493,4,B000OYCMLM,Movie came early . I had the movie built up from previews I had seen on other movies. It was OK . Just one of those movies that when you fight to the end you think hmmmm.,1465257600,,170,3.6216216216216215

A lot of this movie didn't make sense to me. For example, why would these kids want to film a documentary of people dying and if they were able to find/hangout with this serial killer, why couldn't the cops find him? The movie wasn't as cleaver as it wanted to be, working on the clichs of the slasher genre. ""The Final Girls"" did a much better job of mixing comedy with horror.

To make it even better, the original Freddy, Michael Myers and Jason are mentioned throughout the movie and they exist in this universe.

I've spent a lot of time telling people about Behind the Mask. I've also spent some time re-watching it.

I have some issues with it, and it's not perfect, but I love this movie.

The brilliant conceit of this film is that it takes place in a world where Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers are real, and a whole subculture of such serial killers exists.  The best sequence in the film involves a visit to a retired killer (Scott Wilson), who waxes philosophical about the simplicity of the old days and how the younger generation has upped the level of the game.  However, director / writer Scott Glosserman and his co-writer David J. Stieve make the unfortunate decision to abandon their concept for the films final act, and thats where it goes right into the toilet as a substandard slasher flick.  Otherwise, it was well on its way to being a five-star film.",1451433600,,905,4.895424836601308

I liked the idea of it--one of my favorite movies of all time is Man Bites Dog, so the similarity of having a documentary crew follow a serial killer around and developing more and more empathy for the murderer certainly held appeal for me.  However, this movie failed to follow that arc all the way through.  About 2/3 of the way into the movie, the documentarian (mockumentarian?) became too much a part of the story for my taste, and eventually they seemed to abandon the premise they had set up, and devolved into the all-too-familiar tropes of slasher films.  As soon as that happened, my attention drifted.  I watched it all the way to the end, but I couldn't care less about the last 15 minutes.  Now, a few weeks later, I can't even remember how it ended.  I don't recommend this unless you are a fan of slasher films and are looking for a comedy slasher that doesn't really add anything new to the genre.",1442016000,2,1082,4.396984924623116

The way the movie plays with the clichs is funny, but without reaching the unnecessary laughter (as many teen comedies of today), breaking the flow of the plot or falling into the sameness of repeated jokes.
The story of how Leslie Vernon became a ghost legend in the town of Glen Echo has no trace of originality, but this does not diminish the work, as if it follows old patterns in some questions, makes up for in originality in many other points. In fact, the script often we are led to question what is real and what information can be invention of the Leslie's mind, although he seems to have a great self-control emotional front of the cameras, he is still a lunatic.
In addition to the mockery with the cliches, there are some valuable tips of Leslie Vernon how to survive a situation in which we find a serial killer who follow the molds of which he is a fan. This is a treat for people who, like me, love and sometimes perceive themselves spending hours debating horror movies.

Nathan Baesel does a great job as Leslie Vernon and really holds your attention as this charismatic character who you kind of love by the end of the film, but then you realize he kills people.

The the same way that ""Scream"" used the conventions of 1980's horror films, ""Behind the Mask"" does much the same for the slasher film.

In a world where the events of ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" are real, as film crew is in Glen Echo, Maryland to document and interview the next killer ready to terrorize small town America, Leslie Vernon. We meet Leslie as he's making his plans to stalk and kill the viriginal Kelly. As Leslie lays out his plans, using all of the 80's horror cliches viewers will be familiar with, we see the documentary crew begin to second-guess their decision about following Leslie around. As Leslie's plans unfold, the film crew finds themselves caught up in his game, and once the bodies begin piling up, the real horror begins.

Just so much fun, a perfect blend of comedy and horror. Some great cameos by genre favorites and truly unique way to present new slasher. Highly recommended.",1398297600,2,1109,4.711340206185567

I was surprised and delighted by this flick. It was very refreshing, it's done in a quirky style. The mockumentary, although similar to 'found footage' horror films, was just different enough to really capture my attention. This movie is great if you love old slashers. Lots of cool cameos from some horror actors like Kane Hodder and Zelda Rubenstein. Nathan Baesal who plays Leslie Vernon was a real treat. He's got a presence on-screen that I don't think enough actors manage to capture.

overall I found this film to be very entertaining vs actually scary. Personally, I think being entertained is more important and being scared by a movie is an added bonus but not everyone feels that way. Don't watch this expecting a super scary movie if you're more of a horror veteran.

2804711,4,B000OYCMLM,"Wow, what a refreshing film in what has become a stale genre as of late. Along with ""Cabin in the Woods"" this is one of the few new horror films which I thought was genuine and smart. I hesitate to call it a spoof because while it does mention other horror franchise and take light humorous jabs at cliches of the genre, it really attempts to stand on its own, with it's own unique story.

The film is set in a small town where a young man named Leslie (last name in question.) who has chosen the career of a haunting serial killer, to in his mind, balance out the eternal good of the war, which needs an inherent evil to fight. You would think a man of this mind frame would come across as disturbed, unsettled and probably unpleasant to converse with, yet this is quite the opposite. Leslie is a kind, polite and hilarious individual and while he might have trouble feeding his pet turtles he seems like a genuinely nice guy......Well as genuine and nice a person can be while stalking in the shadows and planning to kill over half a dozen teenagers. Along on his life journey of disemboweling sexually active teens smoking weed, he picks up three grad students who make a documentary about him and through the first hour of this film we see the other side of the horror genre. Instead of seeing the killer among the fog and darkness of the wilderness, hunting his prey, this film shows him in the days, hours and minutes leading up to that point. Giddily plotting his ""art"" and setting up some demented ""Home Alone"" type traps. This completely flips the script on the horror genre and it is executed well, it avoids cliches by facing them head on with a smirk.

Yet Leslie isn't fully happy until he finds his ""Ahab"" an eternal figure of good (also his therapist) whom he can duke it out in the finale of Good Vs. Evil. This character is ironically played by Fred Krueger himself, Robert Englund in a character that should remind any horror fan of Dr. Loomis from the Halloween franchise. So along with the help of a dear friend (a retired serial killer who seems to miss picking up the ole' axe and going on a spree or two) Leslie seems well off on his mission and extremely joyous about it. However, the film flips its switch as soon as it lets the light in and plays out well in the third act. In conclusion this is a well acted film for fans of the genre and general movie goers alike. As a horror film released post early 90's this is easily a five star within the genre, buy without hesitation.",1342224000,2,2503,4.380645161290323

2804715,3,B000OYCMLM,"This got overall good reviews so I thought I'd give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't thrilled either.

Here's the scoop. Leslie Vernon wants to make a name for himself as an iconic serial killer. He knows the tricks of the trade in regard to his predecessors Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, et al. He trains and works hard to set scenarios up so he can work them just like they do in the movies. He hires on a college film crew to document everything but not everything is as it seems.

I was of two minds while watching this. It certainly is a clever idea. They poke fun at the genre and it's cliches. The mockumentary style is handled well with the use of two hand held cameras. The viewer does get the sense of being there with these people. What bothered me was that, not only were these people Okay with the idea of Leslie killing people, some of the characters were thrilled. I didn't believe it and it kept me from enjoying it fully. I doubt anyone, serial killer or not, is thrilled with what they do.

What really works is the hairpin turn in the story. When this shakes loose things begin to light up. As clever as most of the movie is, this really works. Things turn dead serious and I liked the way it was handled and the resolve. The acting was generally decent and the production values were good enough. Overall this was a good effort. It's maybe more three and a half stars as opposed to the three I gave it. I can recommend seeing this. It's a good movie. It just might not be THAT good.",1318204800,5,1515,4.2717770034843205
2804716,4,B000OYCMLM,"When Hollywood writers finally caught on to the reality television craze, it became fertile ground for horror movies.  Dozens of horror films featured a gimmick where the ironic hipster protagonists were unable to distinguish between the gruesome murder of a serial killer on film and what lurks in the bowels of the Internet.  But it was always precisely that, a gimmick: victims were still stupid, the police were never clued in until the end, and all that supposed media scrutiny changed little. The progeny of The Blair Witch Project are few and far between. Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon is a worthy successor.

Behind the Mask takes a faux documentary approach, but instead of featuring know-it-all protagonists it thrusts the viewer into a surreal universe where movie slashers are real.  Freddy, Jason, Michael - they're legendary magicians who practice sleight-of-hand, meditation, and rigorous calisthenics all for the sake of committing mass murder.  Our chatty subject is Leslie Mancuso (Nathan Baesel), who is hoping to make it to the big leagues with his slasher debut.  Like a professional wrestler, he reveals all his secrets to a film crew that consists of wide-eyed Taylor (Angela Goethals) and cameramen Doug (Ben Pace) and Todd (Britain Spellings).  They won't be observers for long.

Mancuso takes the crew through his preparation for the horror that is to come, ranging from how he capitalizes on local legends to increase his mystique to his use of computer graphics, fire retardant gel, bullet proof vests, and booby traps to protect himself and waylay his victims.  Along the way director Scott Glosserman brilliantly deconstructs the slasher genre, covering the role of the Final Girl, the violent male vs. female showdown between Final Girl and slasher, and a host of fabricated insider industry terms.

Mancuso has a parent/child relationship with retired slasher Eugene (Scott Wilson) and his younger wife Jamie (Bridgett Newton).  They're a post-horror movie happy couple who dole out parental advice to newcomer Mancuso and their ""go get 'im tiger!"" pep talks are a humorous injection into a pretty dire subject. In fact, it's easy to forget Macuso is there to murder actual human beings until midway through the film when he starts killing people.  Then the fun really starts.

Our film eventually crew grows a conscience, only to be tripped up by the assumed stereotypes of horror films not quite working out the way we expected.  Glosserman switches to a different film speed to show the horror film within a horror film, which eventually includes the film crew. It's all very meta.

If there's a flaw, it's that the film crew's sudden concern for the victims seems completely disconnected from an earlier murder of librarian Mrs. Collinwood (Zelda Rubinstein of Poltergeist fame).  The plot may be a casualty of the editing process.

But logic was never the slasher genre's strong points, and if you can overlook that hiccup, Behind the Mask is a love letter to serious slasher fans who appreciate the genre.",1317772800,,3056,5.092184368737475
2804717,3,B000OYCMLM,"First off let me state that I love this movie, but as has been pointed out by other reviewers the lack of special features really hurts this release.  I would recommend getting the DVD version that has all the special features and hope that in the future anchor bay releases a BD edition that is worth the purchase.  On a side (ish) note, I'm really kinda peeved that this edition WAS listed as having at least a few special features.  The fact that it has NONE is at the least borderline false advertising.

2804719,5,B000OYCMLM,"I loved loved loved this movie. but be warned its really not a traditional slasher movie until the last third.

The training setup etc. portion that makes up the first hour of the film is fun, and shows clear affection for the genre. The final third is essentially a Friday the 13th/ Halloween film at mach speed and is a utter blast.

I was surprised the film actually managed to work some unexpected turns in the plot in that final third, considering how thoroughly it had been layed out before. The switch in shooting style really helped sell the transition.

By the Way there are a few reviews on here that complain about a lack of blood and gore. Evidently they were starin at the ceiling during the grisly bit with the post-digger. Its not one for the Eli Roth Fans but it has a couple instances of good gore and blood. The Story is the real shining part of the film.

The sympathy generated for Leslie is truly astounding, but one thing must be made clear, this is NOT a movie set in the real world, nor is it the jokey but deadly atmosphere of the excellent Scream series, It is set in a unique world where these assorted slashers are a real part of the cultural landscape. He is not a realistic serial killer, and thinking of this movie in the mindset of our world can sap the joy right out of it. This is not Henry: Portrait of a serial killer. its something much different and a worthy part of any Slasher fan's library",1303171200,3,1430,4.344569288389513

The Blu-Ray edition is garbage.  Beyond the lousy packaging, it has no extras: no commentary, no deleted scenes, no bonus features of any sort.  There isn't even a *menu*.  This isn't because there are no extras for the movie.  They're all only on the DVD edition.  I don't know how this makes any sense, but there it is.  Buy the DVD.

2804742,3,B000OYCMLM,"This ended up being a frustrating viewing experience. I was sold right up until the pivotal scene where the point of view changes. After that, it was a generic SCREAM or SCARY MOVIE rehash. The title character, who is fascinating in the ""documentary"" half of the film, becomes a cypher after that, and if this was an intentional statement, it was not clearly communicated. It just felt like an incredibly layered and nuanced performance had suddenly been lobotomized. What a drag.

However, up until the radical shift (which, I'll admit, few genre film directors seem to be able to pull off) in tone and point of view, this movie owned me. Wow. Chilling and hilarious and thought-provoking and quite moving, in a strange way. One scene in particular, where Nathan Baesel's ""Leslie"" reacts swiftly and brutally to a comment made by another character, is one of the most impressive and admirable jump moments I've seen in a long time. I ended up rewinding that part 6 or 7 times, realizing I'd been charmed into letting my guard down just like the character.

I also wish they'd either done a bit more to establish that in this ""universe""- Freddie and Jason and Michael Myers are REAL. The scenes which dealt with this were fascinating and left me wanting more.

One criticism of the better first part of the movie- it was a serious misstep to include Zelda Rubinstein in the silly information-dump scene. It seemed like the actress was reading from cue cards and her timing was ridiculously awkward. One genre-veteran (Robert Englund, who's actually not bad in this)is sufficient, especially when trying to ""sell"" the whole thing as being ""real"".

I recommend this film, but with serious reservations.",1280102400,,1700,4.892361111111111
2804743,1,B000OYCMLM,"As a person who views many films, and personally owns a huge library of movies, I have to say this is not a film that should have made it to DVD or any other form of viewing. The acting was terrible. So was everything else. This is the first time I actually could not sit through the footage. The writer may of had an idea of some nut case taking a cue from slasher movies, to go around murdering people, but at least get people that can act, or at least want to try and act the parts. I say to all ; Save your money !",1279065600,4,518,3.850467289719626
2804744,5,B000OYCMLM,"In a world where Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers were real-life terrors, Leslie Vernon is a young man aspiring to follow in their footsteps. What's so different about Leslie is he's bringing a film crew along for the ride and filling in student journalist Taylor Gentry on all the juicy ""how it's done"" details. Leslie shows Taylor and her crew the tricks of the trade as he stalks the girl of his choice, high school hottie Kelly Curtis, around whom his legend is set to revolve. He also introduces Taylor to the retired killer from which he learned the ins and outs of the business, and they both are surprised when another character gets involved, psychologist Doc Halloran, who is determined to see an end to Vernon's emerging reign of terror.

A truly different addition to the slasher genre, ""Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon"" is a fun, entertaining breath of fresh air. The story is inspired and the cast is great; even Robert Englund in his few but important scenes manages to remind us more of Doctor Loomis than Freddy Krueger, and Nathan Baesel is brilliant as the title character. The film is often called a horror/comedy or spoof, but that's really not very fair. It's humorous in its ideas, but at its heart, it's a horror movie, it's simply from the killer's point of view. Or from a journalist's point of view as she gets the killer's point of view. It's ludicrous, and you may find yourself wondering just how a documentary on how a person becomes a legendary slasher can come together and reach the public without ruining the legend, but in the end we find this is more the film crew's overzealous mistake. To sum it up, to all those horror fans who DIDN'T like ""Scream"", this may be one tongue-in-cheek horror film you can get behind (don't get me wrong, I loved Scream, but I still feel this is to Scream what ""Kickass"" is to ""Mystery Men""). Anywho, final note, props to Angela Goethals for being hilariously reminiscent of Heather from ""Blair Witch"" in this film's opening, and props to whoever chose Kate Lang Johnson's costume for the library scene. Very nice! And, Mr. Glosserman and Mr. Stieve, we eagerly await ""Behind the Mask 2: The Return of Leslie Vernon""!

Now, about the Blu-Ray, one can hardly complain, considering the price this Blu-Ray can be found at if you catch the right sale, but I was shocked that it didn't even have a menu. I've even bought homemade DVDs that have menus. This Blu-Ray is nothing but the film, which runs on a loop until you hit stop. So, be forewarned. The real reason this bothers me though, is I've heard there are bonus features on the standard DVD. I don't know what they are or how many, but that's rather annoying for the Blu-Ray purchaser like myself. Nevertheless, great film that you won't regret purchasing, whatever format you choose.",1274140800,2,2817,4.665995975855131
2804745,4,B000OYCMLM,"It's kind of hard to describe what kind of movie this is. On one hand, it is very much a mockumentary of horror films. On the other hand, mockumentary usually means that it is supposed to be funny, which this really isn't. There's one or two moments where you might get a chuckle, but this really wasn't all that funny. It doesn't really fit into the horror category either. Despite having some decent talent & Robert Englund in it, this really wasn't scary in the least. (At least not to me, anyway.) So yeah... I can't really describe what this is supposed to be.

The film surrounds a film crew comprised of a cute journalist & some camera men. Their job is to film Leslie Vernon as he prepares himself for a big night, a night that should land him in the ranks of Freddy, Jason & other famous horror names. (In this movie they are all real.) With the help of a serial killer from the olden days, the crew initially sets upon their task with glee. However, as the big night approaches they begin to grow more hesitant of their task & begin to wonder if they should warn the potential victims of what their fate has in store for them.

The acting for this was decent. Not the greatest performances I've ever seen, but good enough that I managed to get into the film. The premise of this is great. The idea of a crew doing a documentary of a serial killer is a novel concept, one that really hasn't been done before. It's just that at times it kind of felt like it could have been better done. It's enjoyable enough for me to give it 4 stars, since I know I'll be watching it again, but I can't really see non-horror fans really getting into this. Unless you are familiar with the horror cliches, much of the film's subtle jabs will be lost on the viewer. (These jabs still aren't funny, but knowing what they're trying to poke fun at makes them more entertaining.)

I really think that this is a film that you will either like or you will hate. I don't really see anyone being in between with this movie. I really recommend that people rent this first before buying it, for just that reason.",1272326400,,2093,4.334183673469388

He takes them all over and shows them how he chooses his vitems and how it will happen, and then the killings actually happen as planned out and the film crew decide to stop him and save everyone. It's a good film to watch for people who want to become killers. But really, it's a fun comedy joke.

I was definitely pleasantly surprised. Behind The Mask, is probably one of the most fun movies I've watched in sometime.

It's about turning those classic movie killers into real people that do exactly what Leslie was doing, setting everything up to be perfect. While yes it doesn't have the gore of a slasher, that's not the point of this movie because this isn't your quintessential slasher film which is what makes this movie perfect. Everything you expect doesn't happen and everything that's planned is planned to the ultimate climax. I rarely go out of my way to review a movie because I really don't see the point in it, everyone is going to just have to make their own opinion, but this was a great film. I recommend it.

2804751,3,B000OYCMLM,"At first I thought Behind the Mask- The Rise of Leslie Vernon was going to be similar to the Blair Witch Project when I seen the direction of the storytelling in the very beginning with the whole ""film documentary"" thing going on.  I'm not a fan of that movie so I didn't expect much.

But the film actually turns into a pretty decent horror flick starting somewhere around the halfway point.  It's at *this* point where the whole documentary gimmick goes out the window and the movie then presents itself as a regular horror movie.

The movie is not perfect by any means.  It's supposed to be a fictional documenary on the life of a young guy who goes around carefully planning his strategies showing how he successfully kills his victims.  The only problem is that, the planning ahead on the part of the killer makes this film seem like nothing more than a mockery of all the slasher films of the past.  It basically disects every single step that a killer must take to successfully kill his victims.  This takes away from the horror and the surprise factor.

The guy who played the killer was smart and logical, but he didn't really fit the category for a heartless killer.  He came across more like a young guy who liked having fun which made his character hard to take seriously.

Also, some of the writing was questionable.  The entire library scene was incredibly cheesy and out of place.  I hated it.  The acting was exceptionally bad here.  Maybe I'm alone here.

Perusing through the horror variety proved to yet again be a great choice as we came across Behind the Mask, which has been on the waiting list for some time now. After reading great reviews a while back this one was a welcomed surprise. It's a fantastic mockumentary which pays homage to the Horror classics we all know and love. It's more of a black comedy then actual horror but extremely entertaining.

The movie is shot as a documentary where journalist Taylor Gentry and two camera men follow a man named Leslie Vernon around as he prepares to become the next great supernatural killer. With lots of comedic value he walks you through step by step how his murderous evening will go down in perfect connection with the horror films we've come to love. As the documentary moves forward the crew comes to realize Leslie isn't who he says he is and his murderous documentary is an actual reality. A really great story with a perfect twist.

So naturally Sid simply loved Behind the Mask-The Rise of Leslie Vernon as a comedy-horror that actually works. It wasn't even b and still earned 5 stars, which if you know Sid then you know that's no easy task. There was even a brief couple appearances by the old boy Freddie Kruger where he played a take off of Sid's favorite Dr. Loomis. Fantastic! Overall Sid gives this one a strong recommendation and believes that despite it lack of nudity a young elf would have enjoyed this one years ago. It probably would have put Santa to sleep, but what doesn't? Well besides a game featuring uber redneck Brett Q and whatever team he's on that current season.",1252368000,2,1764,4.5266457680250785

If you are looking for a gorefest..well, you won't quite find it with this, however there is a very interesting scene with a post hole digger.

2804755,4,B000OYCMLM,"A group of grad school journalism students join Leslie Vernon to make a documentary about his profession.  His profession is not typical and causes some ethical dilemmas for the group, but they forge ahead as Leslie entices them, as well as us, to see what it takes to be a serial murderer in Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon.

In a parallel universe, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, and Freddy Krueger exist.  Not only do they exist, but they also inspire.  Leslie Vernon is an up-and-coming serial murderer, out for the typical prey: teens of all kinds: virginal, drunk, high, scared, slow, and dumb alike.  And lucky us, we get to see how these creepy villains train for their nights of terror in this candid ""behind the mask"" look at serial murder as a profession.

Preparation H to restrict blood vessels and slow bleeding, flame retardant make up, sensory depravation chambers to slow breathing and give the appearance of being dead, and intense cardio to outrun and outlast that pesky teen prey are just of few of the hilarious tricks of the trade you will learn from this film.

2804758,4,B000OYCMLM,"Most modern horror movies fall into a trap of following a simple blueprint of whatever is successful at the moment. Japanese horror remakes, torture porn and generic slasher flicks run rampant at movie theatres and video stores. If you want something unique you're probably going to have to go out of your way to find it. Let me tell you, go get a map and figure out how to find the hidden gem that is, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon.

This movie gleefully deconstructs the modern slasher film and in the process makes one of the best horror movies to come out in years. Behind the Mask takes place in a world where Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are all very real. In fact, to would be psycho slashers, they are icons to look up to.

Leslie Vernon is next in line for slasher greatness. Leslie (Nathan Baesel) has hired a documentary crew to follow him around to capture the physical and mental preparation that is required to become a homicidal maniac. Now this sounds utterly creepy, but Behind the Mask has some morbidly dark comedic moments, and trust me, you'll laugh. It's all possible thanks to Baesel's charming ability to make Leslie such a likable character. As he bounds around screen he entertains like a young, energetic Dane Cook (before he began acting and started to suck). You can't help but become enamored with Leslie. Yet you have to remind yourself that he is a sick man that is fully intent on murdering a bunch of teenagers. That underlying fear is what makes the movie work. It's almost impossible to believe that this charming guy is actually a killer. However, once the beguiling Leslie turns it on, the movie pulls a one-eighty. It goes from lighthearted geeky satire to full on horror slasher. Of course you think you know how it will turn out because Leslie painstakingly walks the film crew through his plans...however things go awry and you get to see Leslie live up to the slasher icons he worships.

There are so many reasons to love this film. My only real complaints are that it's not quite as frightening as I would have hoped for and some more unforgettable deaths would have been nice. Those are forgivable though since the constant nods to horror movies and ""business"" terms like ""Ahab"" and ""Survivor Girl"" make my inner geek giddy. Also be on the lookout for cameos from horror vets, Robert Englund, Kane Hodder and Zelda Rubinstein. I watched Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon with a group of friends and we all loved it. I think every horror fan needs to own this soon to be cult classic.

2804803,5,B000OYCMLM,"Part mockumentary, part straight-out horror film, ""Behind the Mask"" tells the story of Leslie Vernon (Nathan Baesel), America's next big serial killer who is eager to follow in the footsteps of his heroes Freddy, Jason and Michael.

""Behind the Mask"" takes the central premise of ""Scream"", that is, a tongue-in-cheek, self-aware horror film populated by characters who have seen too many horror movies and know all of the ""rules"", and takes this premise one step further. The characters in ""Behind the Mask"" are not only aware of the events of other horror movies (in the world of ""Behind the Mask"", the events of these movies are treated as real), but Vernon even explains how much hard work is required for a horror villain to make all of the seemingly supernatural cliches of other horror films a reality. Ever wondered how psycho-killers can manage to keep up with those screaming teenagers, even though they seem to be walking while the teens are running? This film explains that and more.

""Behind the Mask"" is a low-budget, independent film starring few actors whom you have ever heard of (Robert Englund's appearance is little more than a cameo), but in spite of this, manages to put many high-budget studio horror films to shame. The script by first time writer/director Scott Glosserman is creative and funny, and even works well as a horror film, when the shift comes towards the end of the film. Lead actor Baesel is also excellent. This is the sort of film that's success depends entirely on the lead making his character both believable and charismatic. Although Baesel's prior credits comprise simply a few television appearances, he proves himself to be just as effective a horror villain as many of the horror greats who have gone before him.

Being a long-time horror fan myself, I am not sure how someone unfamiliar with the various horror conventions would respond to this film. Then again, how many non-horror fans would be considering watching this movie in the first place? For horror fans, however, particularly fans of ""Scream"", this is a great film, packed with in jokes, that is certain to become a cult favourite.",1231113600,3,2141,4.925207756232687

Nathan Baesel stars as the title character; a mild-mannered, seemingly good-natured guy who is really a would-be homicidal maniac.  The catch here is he's allowing himself to be filmed by a young documentary crew (led by Angela Goethals) as he prepares for his night of slaughter to unfold.

With some great cameos and small roles from genre stalwarts including Scott Wilson, Zelda Rubinstein, Kane Hodder, and Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund; Behind the Mask ends up being an entertaining take on the slasher, even though it really isn't as clever as it thinks it is.

The movie starts as a Documentary about the next ""Supernatural Serial Killer.""  They mention Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers.  Now...Leslie Vernon.  This movie is truly made for the fans.  They cover every cliche in the Slasher sub-genre.  Leslie Vernon is so funny and charming.  The documentary crew follows him as he sets up his own legend.  They interview him about all of the tricks of the trade.  It is wonderful dialogue and acting. You learn about how a supernatural serial killer makes it look like he is walking but somehow keeps up with his victims.  They even talk about all of the symbolism that occurs as the lead girl becomes the heroin.  Absolutely brilliant!

The movie actually changes tone drastically at a certain point.  I will not spoil it for you though.

Like I said, the movie is for the fans.  Someone accused this movie of being unoriginal and cliche.  I must say ""yes, it is.""  That is the point!  They created a movie about the cliches in Slasher Films.  Therefore it is original.  Watch this movie and have fun!  It is truly amazing if you watch it carefully, you find all sorts of throwbacks to Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm St.",1224720000,18,1401,4.560483870967742

However, with this one involving Robert England (Freddy Kruger) and Kane Roberts (Jason Voorhees) it was able to get more publicity then it needed and all of a sudden fans are saying, ""it's original, it's fun"" - it's far from original, and not even done as well as other movies like it. It just got a helping boost from Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm st fans hearing that there heroes where in a new film together.

It seemed like an interesting idea at first glance, but it really lacked in the last few sequences when it became too predictable. It just lacked in actual horror or comedy. It did not know if it wanted to be a horror movie, a suspence movie or a comedy, and it needed more of one or the other.

Tho this one does try to go with a more realistic approach to some similar movies, and not the slapstick kind of ""Freak Out"", it still felt a lack of just that something was missing.

Also, in the beginning of the film, they are comparing Leslie to Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger and even Chucky gets a mention... something tells me the name Leslie Vernon will never come close to being remembered by anyone.

Before you say it, I know already, it wasn't meant to be taken all that seriously and was meant to be a fun movie based on the horror genre, well, why wasn't it funny then?

Either way, I suspect this is the kind of movie you have to see for yourself to find out if you like it or not. I may have given it 2 and a half stars, but that was what I thought of it.

The flick takes place in a world in which Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are real and (in some places) admired for their killing sprees. Leslie Vernon is either a wannabee killer or a killer who's looking for some fame. He invites a film crew to come document his life, his friendships (including his now-retired mentor and his wife) and his plans for his next developing murder spree.

Maybe this is just a function of age; watch a movie at the age of thirty that scared the bejeezus out of you at age thirteen, and you may find yourself wondering what the teenage you was thinking.  Maybe, also, it's simply a matter of unoriginal and uncreative filmmaking.  Horror movies stand almost no chance at all of winning any kind of serious awards or acclaim, so their aspirations are limited, and most of the time they try to bank on the things that have worked before, and over and over again.  It's a safe bet to say that the bulk of horror writers/directors are no longer interested in actually trying to frighten their smirking audiences.  Instead, the genre has devolved into two basic factions: gross-out movies (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Saw-trilogy/dp/B000UO4F8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Saw trilogy</a>&nbsp;or either of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostels/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostels</a>) where all of the creative energy is focused on finding new and interesting ways to slaughter peoiple, or movies that run on pure snark.

BEHIND THE MASK and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hack/dp/B000WC38GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hack!</a>&nbsp;are NOT scary movies, nor were they meant to be.  If you have any doubts about this, they are dispelled from the first frames of both films.  Both flicks were written and produced in the same spirit of cheeky playfulness, and both of them work in direct proportion to the number of horror movie references the viewer is able to catch.  These are not horror films; they are homages.

BEHIND THE MASK is the smarter of the two, which also means it's the talkier one.  Capitalizing on the supernatural serial killer subset of horror films, BEHIND THE MASK seeks to show the genesis of a new killer: Leslie Vernon.  Jason, Freddy, Michael -- the movie demythologizes the dark, demonic roots of these unstoppable murderers by analyzing in detail just what it takes to become one of them.  Leslie, in the midst of his training in terror, has agreed to allow a documentary film crew follow him around as he plans and schemes his reign of blood.  With the help of a mentor (a nicely underplayed Scott Wilson), Leslie sets in motion all of the tried and true totems of any good horror movie: the target virgin, the Ahab (who, in this case, is a straight-faced Robert Englund), the drunken frat boys.  He even expounds on all the ways ""invincible"" killers manage to stay alive, keep their quarry in line, and (seemingly) be in two places at once.

It's a remarkably smart film (my favorite is the deleted scene where Leslie proves that he can, like all hellish fiends, catch up to someone in a foot race without ever actually running).  The film mostly has the faded, grainy quality of the documentary camera, but when Leslie is about to accomplish another horror movie cliche, it changes to the sharp, pre-planned film shots of your average scary movie.  It's a trade-off that's both rewarding and funny; after successfully navigating through another of creepdom's old chestnuts, Leslie grins and dances and jabbers his excitement to the documentarian.  Not the behavior you imagine from a supernatural serial killer, but these are his off-hours.

The film is not without its flaws.  It tries to be a little too smart, and stumbles over its own set-up.  The film crew that's following Leslie begins to feel compunctions about documenting the murder of innocent teens and librarians, and they start getting involved in the action.  This turn of events throws back at the audience the concessions they've already been asked to make, but it also gives the movie a chance to really explore the outer limits of its truisms.  It takes a sharp eye to catch 100% of what BEHIND THE MASK is doing, and some might not think it's worth the effort.  Still, it's at least as clever as any other horror film you might find out there, even if it's not as scary.

BEHIND THE MASK and HACK! are both homages, but HACK! is more openly satirical.  It doesn't go whole hog with the parody until the last fifteen minutes, when the script's self-deprecation becomes equally self-congratulatory, but it doesn't take a viewer of much discernment to see the gears at work in the opening scenes.  The dialogue and acting are so incredibly awful, they're funny in a way that must be intentional.  And, again, audiences educated in horror movie lore should catch dozens and dozens of filmic references, some of them overt, some of them less so.  It's basically what you would get if the makers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Simpsons/dp/B00009N80Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Simpsons</a>&nbsp;sat down to write a scary movie.

That comparison isn't an accident.  A group of inanely stereotypical college students travels to a secluded island as part of some ludicrously vague field trip.  Among the island's inhabitants is a Scottish groundskeeper named Willy (played perfectly by William Forsythe).  Also on the island: a young couple who are crazy about horror films.  The annoying students trade some of the cheesiest banter in movie history, take part in a few gratuitously nude scenes, and get dispatched in gory but decidedly unscary moments.  The characters don't hesitate to announce (over and over) that they feel like they're living in a cliched horror movie.

The only real problem with HACK! is that it works so hard to be cheesy and stupid that it ends up being legitimately cheesy and stupid.  The denoument is the smartest and cleverest thing about the film, when the dialogue gets some punch and when the reflective veneer of the script shines its brightest, but before this you must endure some of the lamest scenes ever committed to horror-film.  True, the scenes are self-consciously lame, but that doesn't make them any less of a chore to watch.  There's only so many times an audience can roll its eyes before its eyes get tired of rolling.

I applaud the effort, though.  Much like BEHIND THE MASK, HACK! turns its final screws during the credits, and provides at least enough giggles to partially make up for the lack of screams the genre as a whole has failed to create in recent years.  At the very least, both films give due credit to the fans they honor.  Horror movies may have gotten pretty stupid in recent years, both flicks seem to say, but that doesn't mean the audiences have, too.",1202601600,3,6688,5.197761194029851

2804852,4,B000OYCMLM,"Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (Scott Glosserman, 2006)

Okay, I have to say this first. All you other actors and actresses for whom I have harbored unbridled lust in the past? Pack your things and get out, 'cause there's a new sheriff in town-- Angela Goethals. Holy cow. Holy jaw-dropping tongue-lolling-on-the-floor-picking-up-dust-and-cat-hair-and-I-don't-care cow.

But even if you don't pop this disc into the player and immediately develop the world's biggest crush on Angela Goethals, there's a lot to enjoy about this flick if you're a fan of the modern horror film. Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon is a fantastic satire of a number of recent horror franchises. It's surprisingly well-acted, well-directed, and a great deal of all-around fun.

Taylor Gentry (Goethals, best known for appearing on the TV series 24) is a grad student working on a video project about serial killers. She hooks up with Leslie Vernon (Invasion's Nathan Baesel), an aspiring serial killer who's planning out a gruesome night at a local house reputed to be haunted by the ghost of, yes, Leslie Vernon, who was supposedly killed years ago by his insane parents. Leslie, however, is very much alive-- or is he? The mysterious Doc Halloran (Robert Englund) thinks differently. Regardless, Taylor and her camera and sound guys, Todd (Britain Spellings) and Doug (Ben Pace) respectively, tag along with Leslie and interview him and those close to him as he works out the details of his night of mayhem. Everything goes wrong, however, when Leslie's final girl (termed ""survivor girl"" in the movie) turns out not to be the girl everyone thought she was...

While I don't think you need to know the Friday the 13th/Halloween/Nightmare on Elm St./etc. movies intimately to get a kick out of this flick-- it's enough to know they exist, and the basic formula behind them-- there are a bunch of in-jokes and sight gags that might not make sense to you if you don't. That said, they'll just look like pieces of atmospheric scene decoration, so it's not like you'll know you're missing anything. Glosserman (and I must note this is the only film I've ever seen where the director's own character is listed at IMDB as ""scenes deleted""-- that in itself is funny enough to warrant checking this out), while obviously interested in injecting little things to amuse the hardcore slasher-franchise fans, concentrates on simply amusing the audience with a good, old-fashioned satire, and he does it very well. The casting, even when it's not someone who should obviously be here, works well, and the script is pointed and funny. Leslie Vernon is a great character-- exactly the kind of combination of sociopath and obsessed fangeek you'd expect to find, while Taylor mirrors him in many slightly uncomfortable ways. Technically, as is to be expected, Glosserman did exactly what he needed to-- took a small budget and made a professional-looking (though not too professional-looking) movie with it, in the same way Cunningham did with the original Friday the 13th or Craven did with the original A Nightmare on Elm St..

Behind the Mask comes off as a labor of love-- not only love for this movie, but love for an entire genre of really, really bad sequels. And how great is that? ****",1199318400,3,3276,4.970802919708029

2804854,5,B000OYCMLM,"Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon is a 2006 horror film / mockumentary directed by Scott Glosserman. It stars Nathan Baesel as Vernon, Angela Goethals as Taylor Gentry (the host of the documentary) and  Robert Englund, who is better known for playing the legendary horror film icon Freddy Krueger of A Nightmare on Elm Street series fame. It follows a film crew documenting a supernatural serial killer who terrorizes the small town of Glen Echo, Maryland. The film starts of as a documentary of a self professed serial killer. So you believe you are watching a comedy and that there is going to be no serious harm to anyone. The reporter and the cameraman possibly think it is not seriously going to happen that's why they possibly go along for the ride until they realise that it is for real. The town of Glenn Echo has a legend of the ghost of a boy who was thrown down the falls for mudering his mother. Leslie vernon believes or wants every one to believe he is the reincarnation of this boy. On every anniversary of the death of the boy, teens from the town dare each other to stay at the suppossedly ghost infested residence of Leslie Vernon. The first half of the movie seems like its going to be pure comedy. The next half slowly transformes into a darker movie ultimately turning out into a proper slasher movie. I haven't seen a mixed movie like this before. Thats what makes this movie so unique. I did not care that much for the trick ending. But I was more sucked in by the duality of genre in the movie. Nathan Baesel and Angela Goethals's amazing performance really suck you into this movie. Bonus features section is exhasutive and includes a casting section documentary, ""days in the life of shooting"" documentary, ""on location"" shoots and table reads by the actors featuring rehearsals. Having a  bloopers section would have been cool.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect but my partner warned my that it wouldn't be like anything we'd watched together thus far.  I laughed through the whole thing.  The documentary feel to the beginning of the movie REALLY worked for me.  Our killer has a sense of humor, a personality, and seems like such a sweet guy.  When he jumped out of the closet to commit the murders, my jaw just kinda hit the floor.  I guess I knew he'd go through with his plans but it was still kinda shocking...  I LOVED IT!
The music was well done, it was just spooky enough at the end.  The juxtaposition of the two moods were perfect.  It wasn't a gradual change which made it even more noticable.
Basically, I thought it was well done.  Great characters, great mood, great everything on this one.  I definately recommend this one with a solid two thumbs up.  :-)",1191715200,32,917,4.457831325301205

2804879,5,B000OYCMLM,"Spinal Tap for the slasher movie genre....this gem starts off as a pseudo documentary of the emergence of the next big name in mass murder, and then gradually metamorphoses into that which it parodies. If you have ever wondered about the motivation, physical conditioning, and careful planning necessary to become the next big infamous, mass-murdering psychopath, then Leslie Vernon is only too anxious to provide insights into this misunderstood profession. Through hilariously clever, beautifully written and presented tongue-in-cheek dialog, we are steadily guided through the exhaustive training and planning necessary to rise to a lofty position in the slasher hall of fame. Indeed, I fear that much of the clever and sophisticated humor will go unappreciated by viewers who are simply looking for another trite slasher flick. This gem is a profound surprise, combining piercing wit with spot-on insights into the conventions of all slasher movies....the doors that slam behind the innocent victim, the ""somebody is watching me"" feeling, the absolute invulnerability of the slasher, etc. etc.

Please listen closely to the complex dialog and enjoy this movie for what it is.....an incredibly clever parody that makes Scary Movie and other humorous homages to the slasher genre seem juvenile by comparison.",1186963200,7,1310,5.517412935323383

2804881,4,B000OYCMLM,"This is one of those movies I wound up watching just to try to see what all the fuss was about. I was incredibly happy that I did. ""Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon"" is an incredibly inventive mockumentary/slasher flick. Most of the film is from the point of view of a group of a grad student named Taylor Gentry who is filming a documentary about Leslie Vernon, an up-and-coming slasher hoping to make his name along with the greats like Krueger, Voorhees and Myers. Leslie is far from your typical slasher, though -- he's clever, funny, charming and extremely pleasant. It's not until he puts on the mask that his slasher persona takes over.

In the ""film within a film"", Leslie details for Taylor exactly how he goes about constructing his ""legend,"" choosing victims and even stages his murders in meticulous detail, all the while keeping that good-natured charm. The movie is funny and disturbing at the same time: funny because of how carefully the filmmakers parody the conventions of the slasher genre and disturbing because of how genuinely likable Leslie is even as he's explaining how he's going to slaughter innocent teenagers.

The few weak points come towards the end, after the film within a film is dropped and we go into the real slasher parts. While the writing is still just as smart and clever, some of the effects are a little weak. Still, this is a lot of fun and well worth it for fans of slasher movies looking for the next Freddy or Jason.",1186012800,15,1473,4.639846743295019
2804882,4,B000OYCMLM,"Having mixed feelings about ""Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon"" strikes me as being inevitable since the movie itself is a mixture of mockumentary and homage.  The conceit of writer-director Scott Glosserman is that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-Vorhees/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason Vorhees</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-Krueger/dp/0780626966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy Krueger</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Meyers/dp/6305546789/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Meyers</a>&nbsp;are all real and that with a combination of brains and luck Leslie Vernon (Nathan Baesel) could be the next great serial killer. But these days if a tree falls in the forest it better be captured on film so Leslie allows young documentary filmmaker Taylor Gentry (Angela Goethals) to interview him and film his preparation for his official ""return.""  The obvious point of comparison here is to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/B00004W20F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>,"" but whereas director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson were interested at playing with the conventions of the horror film from the outside, Glosserman and co-writer David J. Stieve take more of an insider perspective.  Taylor might not know what an ""Ahab"" is, but Leslie and his mentor Eugene (Scott Wilson) can explain such terms and why having an ""Ahab"" is a cause for celebration.

My favorite running gag in this 2006 film is that Leslie meticulously plans his death scenarios, choreography the path his victims will take and anticipating areas of concerns.  Baesel's performance is at the heart of this film because he manages to make Leslie seem like a merry prankster one moment and the next turn him into a menacing figure who sooner or later is going to turn on Taylor and her crew, including Britain Spellings as the affable Todd Best, even if she never picks up on the inevitableness of that point of no return.  Meanwhile, Leslie is on the lookout for the young woman who could be his survivor girl, and thinks he has found one in the virginal Kelly (Kate Lang Johnson), especially since she has the requisite cast of ""supporting characters"" as friends, such as Stoned Guy (Teo Gomez) and Slightly More Stoned Guy (Matt Bolt).  The script was also enough to entice Robert Englund to play Doc Halloran and get Zelda Rubinstein to show up for one day's work as mistress of exposition on the legend of Leslie Vernon (you have to love a slasher with a name that is associated more often with women than men).

I was rather surprised that in the end Glosserman turns his film into a flat out splatter flick, but unlike ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" his characters reach a pont where they have to put down their cameras and try to escape with their lives.  If this is some sort of rejection of the inherently voyeuristic nature of P.O.V. shots from the perspective of the slasher you will have to decide for yourself.  My inclination is that Glosserman loves the genre too much to do anything other than embrace it, even given his comic approach.  It is that affection along with both his creativity and Baesel's performance that make this film come out ahead in the end for me.  Keep an eye out for little details in ""Behind the Mask,"" but Glosserman was not content just to score Englund as Doc Halloran.  That is Kane Hodder who played Jason in several movies walking into 1428 Elm Street (Nancy's home), and Eguene owns a Lament Configuration puzzle box.  The DVD extras included deleted and extended scenes that flesh out the documentary part of the movie and a nice look at Baesel doing lines over and over again in readings to cast other characters.  Final note: be sure to watch the credits at the end, although as soon as they start you should know what the payoff is going to be at the end (not that there should be a sequel because Glosserman needs to be given the opportunity to make a ""real"" horror film and not milk these ideas dry).",1186012800,2,4303,5.629057187017001

Unfortunately, the director couldn't keep a straight face and ruined such a great setup almost immediately.  First of all, why is there another camera filming the film crew if there's only one cameraman in the movie?  If they had followed the example of Blair Witch and at least pretend that the whole thing was real, this could have been a little gem.

Another advice to the director:  If this movie is pretend to be a documentary, don't hire actor that's well known in the genre.  Once he shows his face, everyone know that the whole thing is a fake.  As much as it might have been the director's wet dream to work with such legend, his presence destroyed the entire movie.

Overall, the movie isn't scary and I wonder if it would have been better as comedy.  No, I guess it wouldn't.  They borrowed great deal from many films and there was hardly anything original about the movie.",1185494400,4,995,4.628571428571429
2804917,4,B000OYCMLM,"I was really misled about the content of this film, so it took me a few minutes to begin appreciating what I was watching. The first three quarters of the film was a mockumentary that would have made Christopher Guess proud, and the last quarter a thriller that any one of the Friday the Thirteenths wished they would have been.

The plot: Leslie Vernon is an up and coming serial killer (more like slasher) being profiled by college film crew as he refines his art. We even meet his retired mentor (who, along with his wife, I found to be a real hoot)who treats the art of murdering mass numbers of people as a type of corporate endeavor. We learn about Leslie's backstory, his attempt to create his own legend, and hear him imagine being like his heroes (Michael, Freddy, Jason). We discover some of their tricks and how they select groups of victims. Later, the film evolves into a slasher movie of its own, and one well day even as it follows the same format (intentionally) as the villains it so gleefully parodies.

The real treat of this movie is the obvious affection for masked stalker and slasher flicks of the 70's and 80's, and it's probably helpful if you've at least lived through one of those decades. There are numerous references to the films and their conventions, many of which are at least amusing, sometimes downrigth funny.

I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and would recommend it to anyone who has ever been fascinated enough to sit through good and bad slasher flicks. This will make sense to you.",1185494400,3,1519,4.618518518518519
2804918,4,B000OYCMLM,"Behind the Mask - The Rise of Leslie Vernon is a smart comedy for the horror film enthusiast. If you've seen all of the Halloween movies at least twice (I won't tell anyone that you don't include the third film), or the Friday the 13th movies at least twice, or the Nightmare on Elm Street movies at least twice, then you're bound to enjoy this film. If you're a hardcore fan, you'll get especially excited when you get to enjoy cameos from several horror film veterans (I won't spoil the surprises). While it does capture references to other horror movies (Hellraiser devotees should catch one), Behind the Mask is really about the intrinsic, yet detailed, life and 'rise' of the cinematic serial killer. Scary moments are few, despite what some reviewers have claimed. This movie is purely for laughs, and a look at how ridiculous the history of hollywood supernatural serial killers can be. This most rewarding part of Behind the Mask is that the characters take themselves very seriously throughout.
Behind the Mask starts off a little slow at first, but picks up in the second half. I'll admit that my second viewing was far superior to the first. I found myself laughing far more the second time through; perhaps because I noticed more, and I picked up on the humor of the film better the second time through. But if you bore easily, Behind the Mask may not be worth your time. The film isn't boring in any respect, but it does take a while to really get a grasp of the type of film that Behind the Mask is selling itself as.
The acting is excellent, although the lead is somewhat reminiscent of a younger Jim Carrey, with a very well-written script. The movie is shot in both documentary-style cinematography (shaky camera), and then occasionally changes to a very professional, high quality image for ""dramatic horror"" sequences (another humorous aspect of the film).

It takes the ever typical repetiveness in virtually slasher film that has been around and that's including the many sequels including the poorly made ones....and even paying a direct homage to them.  I found it to be a bit laughable having Robert Englund doing the typical horror movie and portraying the ""Dr. Loomis"" character from the Halloween flicks, as well as having the same sets like the Krueger house being in some of the early shots.

Some of the humor was there....although it could have used a bit more here and there but I do think that they were also wanting to strive for the slasher/horror aspects more.  I was a bit surprised towards the end....it was the plot twist I didn't expect although looking at it now after just watching it I could have almost seen it coming but probably wasn't close.

2804924,2,B000OYCMLM,"Slasher films, a horror movie sub-genre, have devolved far beyond clich.  They are so narrow in there premises and void of originality that many seemingly follow the same screenplay in a different setting and on the surface different characters.  There are only about five or six of these films I would consider good movies and only one or two of which I would call truly original for their time.  In other words, basically all slasher films are directly influenced by one or two movies.  A mockumentary on this subject is an obvious choice and a great idea.  But there are far too many hardcore slasher movie fans and unfortunately for Behind the Mask one of them became its director and lost grip of what should've been the film's goals.

Taylor is a documentary filmmaker who meets a wannabe murderer named Leslie.  Leslie knows all the ins and out of how to become a legend like Freddy Kreuger, Jason Vorhees, and Michael Myers.  Taylor is going to be allowed to document his plan to murder one specific group of kids.  Leslie goes over explanations for all the clichs in slasher movies and indicates many clichs as his kind of unexplained goals, and he even explains a few in comedic detail.  These are the best parts of Behind the Mask and act as a solid commentary toward the dying sub-genre.

I have many issues with this film but mainly my problem is that the premise fails to mock and instead turns into a slasher film itself.  It seems to have fun laughing at how ludicrous slasher movies are and then essentially becomes a celebration of them and in an instant goes the opposite direction I thought the movie wanted to go.  I went from thinking this was a unique movie by a smart filmmaker to thinking it was less than mediocre and directed by nothing more than a fan of slasher films.  Another related issue I had with Behind the Mask is that it was predictable when the film transitioned toward the end, and it definitely shouldn't have been.  When Wes Craven created the satire of slasher films Scream, it surprisingly worked because we suddenly realized that the film is far more intelligent than the subject of its satire.  Behind the Mask is by no means smarter than its subject.  It actually becomes its subject.

Also, my biggest gripe of all is the acting of Nathan Baesel.  I think it was important that his performance work and for me it didn't.  I thought his performance was overdone and too enthusiastic, especially his interactions with Eugene, a retired slasher legend who also talks about murdering as if it is a science.  Director Scott Glosserman is accountable for the film's performances as well but these people are new so I'm sure we will see more quality from them down the road.  Behind the Mask, at the very least does showcase talent from some of those involved.  At least more so than I Still Know What You Did Last Summer or Jason Goes to Hell.

It was recommended to me by my brother, who appreciates slasher films and even said to me that I have to like slashers to like Behind the Mask.  He was absolutely right.  I love horror films and the slasher sub-genre to me has betrayed real horror and negatively effected the quality of horror films we see made today.  So I guess I don't like slasher films overall.  Take my brother's advice here and don't bother if you thought Friday the 13th parts 3 through whatever were lame.  If you like slasher films you will appreciate Behind the Mask as a celebration of the sub-genre.  It just doesn't work beyond that.",1183852800,9,3501,4.6

2804956,1,B000OYCMLM,"Leslie Vernon is a wannabe.

I mean that on two fronts:

1) he's a garden-variety psychopath who wants to be a top-drawer Fiend like Jason, Michael, or Freddy. So ""Behind the Mask"" is all about the nutcake getting into breaking training to prepare for *his* Night in the Woods. *That* I can dig.

2)First-time director Scott Glosserman (whose only other writer/producer credit is---ahem---""No Escape: Prison Rape"") sorely wishes he was an edgy, hip, happening director. Hell, I bet he'd settle for being Eli Roth right about now.

Here's the real deal: I really wanted to like ""Behind the Mask"". I was weaned on hackers, slashers, maniacs, stalkers, & bogeymen: I dig the crawling kingsnake vibe of the mist rising up off Crystal Lake, window-lights like willow-wisps on those lonely Haddonfield streets. The Tropes, man, that's what I'm talking about: the horror movie tropes I mean, the conventions of the genre.

The masked Killer with no face. The way the Killer keeps coming, no matter the drillings, stabbings, bullet-riddlings, or de-guttings he has taken along the way. The Monster's history: spawn of a thousand maniacs, revenant come back from his sea-worm encrusted tomb; liberant from the asylum. Good times.

So when I heard about ""Behind the Mask"", the concept seemed devilish: a documentary film crew setup camp around a Monster-in-Training, recording his exploits as he gets in shape (lots of cardio!), suits up (it's all about the mask!), picks a weapon of choice (scythe, all the better to tie into the 'Leslie Vernon' urban legend), stalks his prey (all about that potential survivor-girl!), and prepares the ground pre-Hunt (it's all about getting rid of those flashlight batteries and sawing halfway through any tree branches that might be used as an escape route).

""Leslie Vernon"" wants to be that movie; wants it badly. But it just doesn't work. It's talky. It's tedious. It offers zero scares; potential, no payoff; sizzle, no steak. It doesn't even offer the shrill little frisson of the Killer as a kind of human landshark with no regrets---it would have been deliciously eerie if, once the Mask was on, the Humanity winked out completely. For the entire movie. But it doesn't work that way.

Yuck. That ""Behind the Mask"" never really gets its travelin' boots down to the Roadhouse---well, it's too bad. But it's surely not the fault of the actors: Nathan Baesel, as our titular affable pychopath, is utterly convincing without overplaying the role. When he keens ""it's gonna get wet in here"", I got pretty excited, because for a second I believed him.

It didn't.

Like Lucky McKee's atrocious, pretentious ""May"", ""Leslie Vernon"" feels like it has been made by, and for, people who have contempt for horror movies. It comes across in the arch, prissy dialogue between our hero and his biographer, in the stilted battinage between the Killer and his aging mentor (the corny stuff about getting an 'Ahab' made me want to stab my eyes out), in the film's inexplicable, nearly nunnish refusal to deliver the horror movie goods: buckets of blood and gore.

We don't get a drop.

For docu-horror done better, check out the Belgian ""Man Bites Dog"" for a descent into the totally depraved, or even ""The Last Horror Movie"" for the same theme with real bite. For a glimpse of the dead sharkeye banality of Evil, there's always the grainy porno-horror of ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"".

But avoid this one: even the nods to classic fare (like the haunting strains of ""Midnight & the Stars with You"" from ""The Shining"") just serve to remind you that you could be watching a *real* horror movie.

As for this thing: do what you can't do to Jason, Freddy, or Michael.

Bury it.

which I enjoyed! I cannot believe it? I have been
having to watch the CLASSICS or been lucky to have
friends recommend horror I have not seen but it was from
the 80's(does not count)this film I am PROUD to say is NEW!
DIR.Scott Glosserman gives a SPINAL TAP MEETS LEATHERFACE
approach to this refreshing look on my fav. genre of film.
Here we get a look at Leslie Vernon a 26yr.old unstoppable
killer with a sense of charm and wit. You follow him from
step 1 on his picking victims to where they will end up
shagging for the night to there demise. You will either
love this movie or hate it(some of my friends did???)I
thought it was VERY funny at times and loved the whole
documentary feel of it. Nathan gives a WILL FARREL approach
at times to this movie which does not hurt the film at all
believe it or not?And he is VERY serious when need be(the
killing's,the blood,the mayhem)Dir. Scott Glosserman gets
HUGE KUDOS from me for I thought it was going to be a looong
time till I saw a HORROR film I would like in 2007!Again
you will either love this movie or hate it. This is a HORROR
movie make no mistake about it! It just has alot of comedy
which I found refreshing and witty. Give it a try Leslie Vernon
ROCKS!!! Also a plus Scott Glosserman say's his FAV.HORROR
film is THE SHINING(not a bad one to pick!)and thru out the
film you will see references to that,from Robert Englund's
character being named HALLOREN to the ending 1921 song MIDNIGHT
being played while Leslie puts on his make-up(MIDNIGHT was the
song on the closing credits of THE SHINING)I really recommend
this film and enjoyed it 100% Nathan is going to have a great
career in front of him and the cast was very good ROBERT ENGLUND
SCOTT WILSON and a great performance from the ever beautiful
ANGELA GOETHALS(moochie-moochie)...AMAZONERS THIS JUST IN..SEPT
7TH 2007 they are saying the movie...""HATCHET"" is not only
going to be the best HORROR film for 2000-2007(to tell the truth
that don't impress me much)but it will be along side the likes
of THE SHINING-HALLOWEEN-JAWS-NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST.-HELLRAISER
CARRIE-TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE...NOW THAT WILL IMPRESS ME!

  ....MIDNIGHT..BROUGHT US SWEET ROMANCE..I KNOW OH MY WHOLE
LIFE THRU...I'LL BE REMEMBERING YOU ALL MY WHOLE LIFE THRU..

2804959,5,B000OYCMLM,"This movie gets horrible reviews by people who do not appreciate horror movies.  I grew up with the slashers (Halloween, Friday the 13th, TCM).  Knowing that, it's cool to see a movie where those guys were real, and it's an important key to society to have a killer.  How they shoot the movie was beyond great.  The film holds true to the comedy/mockumentary that it tries to reach, but also sticks true to horror, given there are a few scenes that are jumpy.  The mask is creepy, too!  Watch this is you appreciate everything the 80s spewed out at us.",1183248000,7,552,4.47
2804960,1,B000OYCMLM,"I love my horror movies.  Straight to the point stalker/slasher/murderer/hauntings, etc., but this documentory type horror movie was totally boring.  I think the plot of the story was stupid and then unfolding the movie was even worse.  Don't waste your time buying this one.",1183248000,7,275,5.204545454545454
2804961,5,B000OYCMLM,"Some places have called this film 'Scream meets The Blar Witch meets Best In Show'. A better description there could never be. This hybrid mix of spoof/drama/horror/ that splits between documentary style tape and slasher film is all over the place. Amazingly, it never loses itself. The acclaim and good word of mouth is most appropriate. BTM delves deeper in the horror cliches than ""Scream"". The movie follows a documentary film crew led by Taylor Gentry(Angela Goethals) as they film a nice, young guy named Leslie Vernon. Leslie is not normal. The film takes place in a world where all of the shenanigans Jason, Freddy, and Michael pulled at Camp Crystal Lake, Springwood, and Haddonfield all really happened. Leslie wants to be a part of it and to be the next great serial killer. He lets this film crew film his every move and shows them just how he is going to pull it all off. We see Leslie take the crew thru every imaginable horror film cliche step by step. It's amazing how well thought out the script is, and how the writer seemed to get every cliche in there. The movie, by Scott Glosserman, is undeniably clever, inventive, and darkly twisted. Jokes and gags are strewn throughout, and they all work. I was never disappointed with any of it. You will get a fair share of laughs with your screams. Like 'Scream', the comic aspects are funny and spoof-like, but when the horror and terror sets in, it's all real. It turns deadly serious, and this is when the movie turns to actual film. The movie may be funny and comical, but it also takes the horror aspect of it seriously. By then, no one is laughing. Robert Englund is along for the ride as Dr. Halloran, who is basically the 'Loomis' to Leslie's 'Michael'. Having him in a film that mentions Freddy and his exploits as real is another hoot. Horror fave Zelda Rubinstein also has a small part as a librarian. Besides showing the filming sites for the already mentioned horror classics, there are other nods if you look closely, as when Taylor is standing next to a sign familiar with Haddonfieldians and girls all in white jumping rope, ala 'Elm Street'. The performances are great. Nathaniel is a real find. Funny, charming, and with a real presence. He gives a knockout performance as Leslie. Angela Goethals turns from Diane Sawyer in the beginning to horror movie heroine by the end. Scott Wilson is another plus as a retired serial killer named Eugene, who provides some of the best moments in the film. Horror fans will be pleased with the blood(it's there, but not a whole lot of it), as with the gratuitous nudity scene and sex scene that also seems to go along with the type. With it's sly, knowing script, sharp comedy, real horror, great direction, and electric performances, Behind The Mask is a film that delivers it all in spades. One of the better films of it's kind I have seen in many a moon.",1182902400,5,2875,4.6171875
2804962,4,B000OYCMLM,"Behind the Mask is a real gem in the usual costume-jewelry junk pile of ""horror/comedies"" in that it is able to make fun of the clichs (as well as geek out, without alienating a less-than-knowing audience), while proving that these clichs became such for a good reason: they work. For the first hour, the movie is a straight-on mockumentary, then it takes a turn and becomes a classic stab-and-slab old-school horror movie.",1182902400,9,423,4.888888888888889
2804963,5,B000OYCMLM,"Actually, the most creative since Scream or the Blair witch project.  This could be a tribute or homage to horror films like Friday the 13th, Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm st like Shaun of the dead was to Zombie films and it is but then creates something original and stands alone.  Your saying come on now Mike, those are legends what would Freddy say, well Freddy or Robert Englund stars as Doc Halloran, Leslies opponent much like Dr. Loomis in Halloween was to Michael Myers.
This movie is like horror film school or serial killer school whichever you prefer.
The acting was great the director Scott Glosserman told Jim Hemphill from reeldotcom that they all got wasted together to bring them closer.
The next great psycho horror slasher has given a documentary crew exclusive access to his life as he plans to terrorize the town of Glen Echo, all the while breaking down  the conventions of the horror genre.
The movie is also funny as Leslie makes preparations for his night of carnage like nailing down the windows because they only jump out of the second story windows for whatever reason.  Doing tons of cardio to give the appearance your walking after the victim who is running.  Sawing the weapons in the shed so they'll fail when used against him.  It's all good stuff.
If you want to watch people get tortured go watch any horror film over the last three years, if you want to see something original and your a fan of the horror genre definitely check this out.  Director Scott Glosserman is a fan himself of 80s slasher films and credits Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and The Shining as influences and inspiration to make Behind the mask.
The more horror you've seen i think the more you'll appreciate this film.
Hope people check this out, let me know what you think.",1182816000,8,1781,4.634920634920635
2804964,5,B000OYCMLM,"A must see for any fan of slasher films. Good acting. Good script. This movie works.

8187494,5,B000OYCMLM,I watched this movie actually thinking it was something completely different... and never have I been so pleasantly surprised! I loved the dark comedy in the film and the cameo's are both surprising and amazing. Psycho Killer. Qu'est-ce que c'est. Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-far better run,1526774400,,289,5.744186046511628

8187496,5,B000OYCMLM,A modern classic as far as I'm concerned. Part comedy/mockumentary part slasher. Nathan Baesels nails the role of Leslie Vernon. The man should be an A-listen. If you like slashers I can't recommend if enough.,1523059200,,209,5.0
8187497,5,B000OYCMLM,"Imagine a horror movie about about horror movies... much like Scream there is the story that is told on screen but another story that comments about horror as a genre if you pay attention to the breaks in the fourth wall.

This asks us to imagine a world where deranged slashers Freddy, Chucky, and Jason are all real.  Within this world there is a documentary crew following the next big killer plotting his night of revenge in a small community.",1522886400,,447,4.575
8187498,4,B000OYCMLM,We gave up on this one about 30-minutes in because it was billed as a comedy and we didn't find it humorous and the woman doing the documentary was too hard on the eyes. We came back to it a few weeks later and it got much better though the hair and face on the woman doing the documentary didn't get any better. The way Leslie sets up his night of murder is worth the price of admission and it explains almost every horror movie that has a group of people in a place where they will be killed off one by one. There is some humor in it and its a dark comedy that Im glad I didn't totally give up on.,1522540800,,599,3.8780487804878048

Maybe he was in the interview for just one portion and I missed it. I really wanted to hear from him (one of the most underutilized actors ever imo, just love his talent). That was the only disappointment I had. I've been a fan of this movie for a while and was lucky enough to get a preorder from Scream Factory that came in early.",1521158400,,466,4.188888888888889
