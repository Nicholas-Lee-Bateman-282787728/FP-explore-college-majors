8747637,4,B000UMSALY,I have only used DVDs 1&2 for a short time but I find them to be worthwhile. I would have liked a written & photographic explanation of each of the moves accompany the DVDs.,1287705600,,173,4.117647058823529
8747638,5,B000UMSALY,"I bought this series for my husband who is in a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury.  We have practiced the first DVD a few times together and we are both very satisfied with the purchase.  The emphasis on breathing awareness is so important for exercise and meditation.  The instructor on the DVD uses such slow, fluid movements that the exercises are relaxing yet refreshing at the same time. (Is that possible?)  We are looking forward to viewing the rest of the levels in the series.  Thank you Dr. Chen.",1199664000,,511,4.571428571428571
