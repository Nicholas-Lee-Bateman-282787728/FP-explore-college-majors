Well, sexy, no - the Asian star was not utilized at all except for looking on as things happened - she was definitely attractive but it seemed as though the filmmakers were afraid of her sexuality, so much so that they didn't consider using it to make the film something to remember.  As it is, it is a lot of fluff without a bottom line.

As for Karzan, the 2nd feature, it may actually be more enjoyable because it's low-rent enough to provoke a lot of laughter, whether intentional or unintentional.  Overall, these two films are nothing worse than the usual jungle dreck that has been previously released over various decades.  They just fit right in with the dreck and let the viewer down, instead of keeping him, well, up.",1349654400,4,788,4.4825174825174825
8171127,4,B000MRA56U,"This one is campy, funny and cute.  Luana the female Tarzan character saves the animals and is the living embodiment of the Jungle itself.  In reality she is a sexy, petite asian actress who doesn't say a word.  Pure camp and good for a laugh. I like anything that protects the animals and shows some boobies so this film is aiiiight with me.",1250208000,17,342,4.396825396825397
