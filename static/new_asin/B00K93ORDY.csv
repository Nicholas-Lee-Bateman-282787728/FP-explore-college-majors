This movie is a faithful rendering of the Shaw play. No color, glitz, or music as in My Fair Lady. The acting is superb, and Wendy Hiller is the perfect Eliza Doolittle. This film is a delightful dramedya filmed version of the classic playa cinematic treasure that is must see viewing.",1479859200,,432,4.538461538461538
