7420265,5,B014PAI7A0,"Excellent documentary. This was made with full permission and cooperation of the band, and you can tell. It shows extremely rare early live videos from the band's club days from the band's vaults, and tracks their rise to stardom. You don't need to be a twisted sister fan to enjoy the movie- I have heard from others who loved the movie and never listened to the band. A must watch.",1456704000,10,383,4.485714285714286
7420266,4,B014PAI7A0,"I enjoyed this because it had alot of classic footage ive never seen before. It was good and long and had me interested. Ive been a SMF for as long as i can remember so when i seen this i had to get it 1st day!
The only downside is is it only covers the 1st ten years of the band in the clubs. I expected an Overview of Everything the band has done to this point. Would have been nice to see Rare Come out and Play and Love is for Suckers footage and thoughts on those Albums. But again i did Enjoy it as they are one of my all time favorite bands. It was good i cant really complain. SMF 4 LIFE!!",1456531200,9,597,3.784
7420267,5,B014PAI7A0,"If you want the ""Stay Hungry"" era TS, probably not for you.  This is an awesome look into the early Twisted Sister days, when they were a relentless club act that took no prisoners.  Lots of archival media, which is very impressive considering how much seems to have been lost from the 70's.  An amazing look into the machine that ""built the bandwagon"" of glam/hard rock.",1465948800,2,371,4.590909090909091

7420270,4,B014PAI7A0,"Saw this on Net***x and liked it. If you are a fan, and from New York/Long Island you will love this, as the footage from the clubs will bring back the memories as it did for me.  I take off 1 star because the concert footage is in very short snips so you don't get to see even one full song, plus there is an interview going on over the music almost all the time.  What would make this perfect is to include about 15 to 20 minutes of actual concert film from a few venues.  As an interview documentary, this rocks, as a showcase of their performances, it rolls over.",1465430400,2,567,4.09009009009009

7420274,5,B014PAI7A0,"Absolutely fantastic. Great documentary by Andy Horn. Even if you aren't a music fan...even if you've never heard of Twisted Sister...this was an incredible story about what it takes for a club band in the 70's to make it to the big leagues.  Funny, engaging and entertaining!  Highly recommended.",1464220800,,297,5.040816326530612

7420276,2,B014PAI7A0,This band always sucked. They were thrown off Atlantic as soon as they got on it....  Yeah the one thing they did have was they could play. But the songs were stupid. I remember Stay Hungry well. A joke.  Interesting on the history on a band on how they developed a following without a label. It was a cult freak show that's what it was about. And Dee Snider just kept pushing this till  luck struck them but in the end they got what they had coming... The reality that they were not good in the song writing department. Yeah you can rock rock rock but if that's it you don't have it.,1463529600,,584,4.150442477876106
7420277,4,B014PAI7A0,"I am someone who really only knew their popular 80's hair-metal music, so I appreciated learning about their extensive early history. As a filmmaker, I thought the film had a choppy flow and it could have been edited down to well under 2 hours. And the lack of any cinematic style -- all the interviews were shot with no eye toward cohesion-- gave it all an amateurish vibe; though to be fair, I imagine this is partly due to limited budget and a long production schedule. Thankfully, all the band members and fans are real and honest and funny and likeable which is more important in a music doc than technical wizardry.",1463184000,,621,4.553571428571429
7420278,5,B014PAI7A0,"Very cool documentary about this history of the band.  This documentary focuses primarily on the early years.  However, they leave it open for a second documentary and I really hope they do one.  I would love to see and hear about Mr. Snider taking on the PMRC and if there were any consequences or impact for his intelligent and candid testimony.  Especially toward Al and Tipper Gore...lol.",1463184000,,392,4.8059701492537314

7420282,5,B014PAI7A0,"The movie was of course fantastic, funny,informative, and really gave the details of the trials and tribulations of the greatest rock band that played the tri-state area in that decade and possibly  the greatest that ever came out of the whole east coast. I gave it five  stars because the documentary deserves five  stars, enough said!",1461369600,,336,4.964285714285714
7420283,5,B014PAI7A0,Fine flick here. Just wish they would have covered more of the 80's. We can hope for a volume 2.,1461369600,,96,3.85
7420284,4,B014PAI7A0,Cool to get the story behind the making and breaking of the band. Just wish it would have continued through the success and downfall and return of the band. Maybe there will be a sequel.,1461369600,,186,4.3428571428571425

7420289,1,B014PAI7A0,"This is great if you want the inside scoop on TS's struggle in the early days. However, if you are only interested in the popular , 'metal' version of the band, i.e, post 1982, this is useless.",1460678400,,193,4.243243243243243
7420290,5,B014PAI7A0,"OK, so I was disappointed that they didn't cover TS's MTV-and-after days. But in truth, that's the only quibble I have with this movie. This is no 45 minute, watered-down Behind the Music b.s. This is a serious, 2+ hour documentary on a great Rock and Roll band. When it was over, I wanted more. And that says a lot about the band, and this movie. Highly Recommended, especially for any other SMF's out there.",1460505600,,409,4.466666666666667

7420292,5,B014PAI7A0,"Great documentary on Twisted Sister! There are some really great insightful stories in here. Even after knowing and listening to Twisted Sister for 32 years there was stuff I never heard or knew about them. Definitely a must watch for any SMF. I thought this would cover the band up to current time but the documentary ends right at the point where the band gets their big break. I would love to see a ""part two"" covering from Stay Hungry up to now.",1458777600,2,449,4.421686746987952

7420294,4,B014PAI7A0,"This blu-ray is viewable in region B (well at least mine is).

Picture quality is awesome, sound is awesome (evaluated from the stereo speakers of my TV), and the disc has almost all you could want from these guys. There are loads of extra material.

My only grievance is that there is very little about ""the fall"" of Twisted Sister. Nothing about how the band was torn apart and how they later reconciled their differences and got back together. I guess I had hoped for the ultimate documentary on Twisted Sister, but it mainly focuses on the struggles the band went through to get a record deal. This is a tale of how insanely and absurdly jinxed the band we all know today, really was.",1458345600,3,688,4.496

7420301,4,B014PAI7A0,"I thought the doc was good and Im glad that theres a Twisted Sister doc finally made, but I almost knew everything in the doc. I understand it had to be made for non-TS fans. There were a few things about the lineups before Dee joined that I didn't know, there's also silent footage of the early TS before Dee. Im glad that the doc was over two hours. From the Dee years forward, the only thing I really didn't know was that they used to hang Barry White in effigy. I thought there should have been more concert footage featured in the film, and the concert footage should have been labeled. I've never seen some of the footage. I was surprised that they only found a few fans to in interview. There are no interviews with people from famous bands who saw them. Ive heard that 3rd drummer Tony Petri wasn't a good person, but they should have explained more about why he was fired, which is in Dees book if they didn't want him interviewed in the doc. The interviews with the band were too laid back. It didn't seem dramatic. The extras were pretty good on the blu-ray. If you own all of the Twisted Sister dvds with the commentary and have seen their VH-1 Behind the Music, then you pretty much know everything in the doc.",1457136000,,1223,4.321739130434783

Over the years I myself would drag people to a show and plant them right in the front and say GET READY TO GET YOUR HEAD BLOWN OFF!
I have the DVD and Ive watched it a few times already. Even if you have never seen Twisted get this DVD, and see the struggle of one of the best live bands ever!!! Thank you Twisted Sister for so many great times!",1456963200,3,659,3.8529411764705883

7420306,5,B014PAI7A0,Great documentary. Full of old footage and the story of what really was going on before MTV. I am a proud father of passing the heavy metal torch to my kids. This is one of those films that give a history lesson for them...  Great job guys...  \m/,1456704000,3,247,4.125

8731484,4,B014PAI7A0,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Andrew Horn, ""We are Twisted F***ing Sister!"" documents Twisted Sisters slow rise to fame from 1972-1983, focusing on their energetic club days in the New York City region, culminating with their first two albums UNDER THE BLADE (1982) and YOU CANT STOP ROCK AND ROLL (1983).

Twisted Sister were outrageous (or eye-rolling) with their make-up shtick, but they were one of the most dynamic live bands and, actually, had some great songs, like Burn in Hell, The Beast, Horror-Teria and The Price, all from their best and most popular album STAY HUNGRY (1984).

The movies edited excellently focusing on interviews with numerous band members, managers, agents, club owners, wives (i.e. Suzette Snider), fans, producers, etc. Guitarist Jay Jay French and front man Dee Snider are, to be expected, the focal point of the interviews. Theres also a lot of raw footage from these years, the best being their 1982 debut in England opening for Motorhead with Lemmys (much needed) blessing. Dee learned from years on the club circuit how to engage an audience and demand nothing but the best.

Personally, Id be more interested in what happened WHEN they were famous for five years and quickly fell out of vogue circa 1983-1987, but thats another movie. This one is compelling and entertaining throughout, despite its length (2 hours 15 minutes). It goes without saying, skip it if you don't like the f word, lol.
