My son loves watching the video and everyone in the family now knows the proper names for the construction equipment lol.",1357516800,,260,4.285714285714286
8196545,5,B000QJLLYY,"My Two year old grandson just loves this video! He loves trucks and I noticed that when his dad was watching it with him, he also seemed to enjoy the close up view of how the trucks perform.  Great buy!",1265328000,,202,4.05
8196546,5,B000QJLLYY,"My 2 year old son has had this video for about six months, and he adores it.  It's not an exaggeration to say we've probably watched it about 100 times since we purchased it.  The quality of the video is great, and the explanation of each of the diggers keeps his attention.  He can name every digger now and has really developed a love for construction equipment.  I highly recommend this video for any little one interested in machinery.",1249862400,,439,4.518987341772152
8196547,5,B000QJLLYY,We got this for my son when he was a year old and he loves it.  My son ended up learning (and can recognize from a distance) all the different construction machines in the video.  There was some road work outside of his classroom at daycare and he was telling the other kids and teachers what all the machines were.  It's pretty cool and seeing any of these machines still makes him happy even though he's 30 months now.,1248912000,,420,4.291139240506329
8196548,4,B000QJLLYY,"Forget the Wiggles and Thomas the Tinkering Tank Thing... if your kids are into diggers, they'll really dig this video! In fact, they'll be able to recognize Front Loaders, Water Trucks, Back Hoes and Tractor Scrapers before they learn to say Momma and Dadda... well, almost. But seriously, it's light-hearted entertainment that's great to put on when trying to prep dinner or just relax for a few minutes, and certainly more tolerable than listening to Elmo squeal about going Potty or whatever it is he's up to these days.",1212451200,,524,4.898876404494382
8196549,4,B000QJLLYY,"Our two year old loves tractors and construction vehicles so we got this video. He loves it. We don't watch alot of tv or videos in our house, but this keeps his attention when I am nursing his infant sister and can't play with him.",1211846400,,232,4.177777777777778
