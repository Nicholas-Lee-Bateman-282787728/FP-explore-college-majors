7671627,5,B01C0BXFIU,"This is one of the most amazing, informative and educational presentations on the whole human process of inception to birth. Should make one think a few times before playing roulette with casual sex or considering an abortion. This DVD is the real deal. Should be mandatory viewing in middle and high school.",1472515200,,308,4.9423076923076925

7671631,5,B01C0BXFIU,"In this amazing and fascinating documentary, you will get to discover the thrilling story of how you were made, from the moment of conception to the moment of birth 280 days later. You will follow the gestation process, one of the most exquisite biological choreography found in nature__ probably next to the unbelievable butterfly gestation__ where scientists have had centuries of research and study to present the facts in this documentary about human gestation process. If you appreciate health and would want to know about certain biological gifts that you may possess where others may not, then this documentary will thrill you immensely since you will witness humans with deficiencies where you may have never heard of or seen at all. Infact, you will get to appreciate the fetus much more than you have before and you may even look at abortion much differently. Extremely useful and informative documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

The First 8 Weeks: Episode one tells the story of the first 8 weeks when a single cell, no bigger than a speck of dust, transforms into the most sophisticated organism on the planet  a human fetus. The clock starts with the moment of conception, but days after our story can take the most unexpected turn.

One of a Kind: Episode two continues to follow the incredible journey focusing on the middle months of our time in the womb when we become unique individuals. For the first ten weeks of pregnancy our biological sex is hidden. Meet the remarkable village of people in the Dominican Republic where the sex determination process in the womb doesnt always run to plan.

The Final Countdown: Episode three journeys through the final months in the womb  a time when we grow strong and develop our vital survival tools for our first breath. For most, this is when our cartilage changes to form a skeleton of over 200 bones, but very occasionally it doesnt.",1467763200,4,1894,4.88785046728972
7671632,5,B01C0BXFIU,"I just watched this on LPB (Louisiana Public Broadcasting), and it was fascinating! Beautiful pictures of life in the womb combined with the stories of people with different conditions that formed early in development.",1467158400,7,218,5.4411764705882355

7671636,3,B01C0BXFIU,"This is well done, but not what I expected.  I wanted more biological focus and not the human interest examples of what can go wrong and why.",1489276800,,141,4.222222222222222
7671637,5,B01C0BXFIU,"I saw part 1 on our PBS station and was so enthralled by the production.  Sadly, I missed the rest of the series.  I decided it was time to see the rest and share if needed.  Absolutely fantastic.  I learned so much already.  Plan to share it with others",1488412800,,254,4.1020408163265305
7671638,5,B01C0BXFIU,This is a wonderful tape.,1487980800,,25,4.2
7671639,2,B01C0BXFIU,"Not a bad film, but not quite what I expected.  I was hoping for more biology and less human interest story.

Almost all of the stories are related to genetic/developmental disorders, some of which are very rare.  So if you are not so afflicted, this is not exactly the 9 months that made you.

The animations and photos of human development are disappointing.  Many illustrations are used over and over---some in almost every segment.  It looks as if the producers had a  limited supply of such animations and illustrations.

Some of these video portions are vague, and many are rendered with sparks and  flashes and ""zzzzzitt"" sounds to make them ""interesting.""
I'm quite sure that most of the students who viewed this didn't have an idea of what they were looking at.  It wasn't very clear to me at times---and I teach biology.  Some of the animated pieces seem to be randomly inserted just for effect---unrelated to the processes they attempt to illustrate, and not very accurate.
.
""Miracle of Life"" still outclasses this video in terms of explaining and illustrating what happens in the womb.

My students did find some of the stories interesting, but the video itself is not particularly exciting or compelling.",1487116800,5,1218,4.88780487804878

7671644,1,B01C0BXFIU,"Don't buy this item, because it is not what it claims to be. Rather that present the normal process from conception to birth,  it is almost entirely abnormalities instead.  I'm sending it back!",1482537600,4,193,4.818181818181818

7671657,5,B01C0BXFIU,I absolutely enjoyed it and am passing it on to my family to enjoy it also.  It's so informative.  I had tears in my eyes at the very end after watching it.  I have six children and just amazed of what was happening inside my body.  Thank you.,1473724800,2,243,4.0
7671658,5,B01C0BXFIU,This is an excellent and current DVD production on the nine months prior to birth.  Outstanding photography plus very interesting information on how genetics work and can take take a different path. Worth the money and time spent watching it. It's also available on public television periodically as a three-part series.,1473206400,,320,5.2745098039215685

7671661,5,B01C0BXFIU,"After watching this on television, I decided I had to get the DVD. I will be teaching high school biology this year and thought this would be a great resource for the class. Production values are high, the human side is very tastefully done and very sensitive to those people featured as examples of embryonic development going awry.",1472774400,,333,4.758620689655173

8752025,5,B01C0BXFIU,"So you think being gay, a transgender, or whatever sexual function that is being labeled as a mental problem, then you need to watch this PBS documentary to understand that sexual identity has more to do with our development than our environment. Besides touching on that issue, this is a great documentary about the entire process of what happens from conception to what emerges as you or me months later!",1531180800,,406,4.814285714285714
8752026,5,B01C0BXFIU,"Everyone over the age of 17 should watch this. The wonder of the way life starts and prepares to live on his or her own is explained.
Also explained the mechanisms required to make the baby who he or she will be. If you don't understand why some folks are heterosexual
and some are not, and some are somewhere in between on gender assignment, you must see this. There are a number of factors that are involved in gender assignment. It's NOT a choice!",1531094400,,450,4.369047619047619

8752032,1,B01C0BXFIU,"This should not be called the ""9 Months That Made You"".  It should be called ""9 Months That Made A Very Small Percentage of the Human Race"".

I bought this movie to watch with my newly pregnant wife so we knew scientifically what was happening inside of her.  We made it through two parts before we were both terrified of the pregnancy.

If you are expecting, I recommend not watching this.  While a lot of the deformities are interesting and heart breaking... it's not necessarily something you want to see at this time.

Way too much time is spent on stories of individual people who had a deformity or other statistical anomaly.  Very little biology and science is involved here.",1515110400,,682,4.633333333333334
