7855860,4,6303937470,"Owen Hart, British Bulldog, and New Rockers VS Doug Furnas, Phil Lafon, and The Godwinns: Phil Lafon puts on a helluva show in his first WWF outing alongside Doug Furnas. Lafon hits an awesome move from the top rope on Cassidy and the annoucers have no idea what it was. I don't know why they didn't push these guys harder. LaFon and Furnas are the sole survivors in there debut in a great opening match,

Undertaker VS Mankind with Paul Bearer suspended in a cage over the ring: Undertaker dominates the first half of this brutal match, stomping on Mankind's fingers so he cannot use the mandible claw but Mankind comes back. A very good, brutal match as Executioner saves Bearer from getting a beating. Anybody remember Executioner?

Triple H, Goldust, Jerry Lalwer, and Crush VS Marc Mero, Rocky Maivia (his debut), Jake Roberts, and Barry Windham (Named The Stalker with an excellent moustache): Mark Henry was injuried before this match and couldn't compete. I cannot belive he has been in the company for almost 14 years. They replace him with Jake Roberts. Sunny is doing guest commentary and trying to be a heel replacing Lawler, who is in the ring. Jim Ross is hitting on Sunny pretty bad and it gets annoying. Rocky is the last man in the ring against Crush and Goldust. He does look good in his first match as both men double team him. Rocky ducks a heart punch and pins Crush with a flying crossbody block and then beats Dust with a shoulder breaker. He looks good in his debut in a decent little match.

Steve Austin VS Bret Hart: Not much to say about this match, a true classic and the ending looked great.

Faarooq, New Razor, New Diesel, and Vader VS Jimmy Snuka, Yokozuna, Flash Funk, and Savio Vega: New Disel pins Vega via power bomb and then everyone brawls in the ring to a double disqualificaton. A crappy ending because the match was actually going good.

Shawn Michaels (with Jose Lathiro) VS Sycho Sid: A long but good match. Sid wins the belt in the end but I thought the ending sucked.

Overall, a must see WWF PPV. It included a debut of a tag team that never was (Furnas and Lafone) and the debut of The Rock. It featured two of the hottest feuds Hart/Austin and Mankind/Undertaker at there very start, at least before the famous Hell in the Cell between Undertaker-Mankind and WrestleMania submission match between Hart-Austin. It featured some old legends return-Jake Roberts, Barry Windham, and Jimmy Snuka even though none really stood out. The elimination match before the main event could have been good but it was ruined by a crappy double disqualification finish. The main event was very long but Shawn Michaels was in the prime of his career but the ending sucked. A must see event.",1258416000,,2721,4.646569646569646
7855861,4,6303937470,"Thanks once again to WWE's ""Classics On Demand"", I relived an old PPV in the 1996 Survivor Series which was the first Survivor Series coming from Madison Square Garden.  This Survivor Series was history making as it was the WWF debuts & returns for so many various superstars...but there was one ""electrifying"" individual who stood out more than everyone else.

Elimination Match: Doug Furnas, Phil Lafond, The Godwinns (Henry & Phineas) vs. Owen Hart, British Bulldog, New Rockers (Marty Jannetty & Leif Cassidy a.k.a. Al Snow) - This was the debut of Furnas & Lafond who made their names & reputations in Japan along with a minor buzz in the United States working for ECW (along with Furnas having a small run in WCW back in '90).  This match was really nothing more than a showcase for them as a tag team in a good average opening match but one moment that really stood out was this suplex that Furnas gave Owen that had a nasty landing.

Undertaker vs. Mankind - This was Undertaker's first appearence since the Buried Alive match the previous month along with the debut of his latest look (all leather).  This match had the stipulation that Paul Bearer would be above the ring in a cage so he wouldn't get involved in the match.  This was a different match than we're used to seeing in the Taker/Mankind series as Taker took a different approach here & actually did more wrestling here than what is expected from him including doing various moves like a drop toehold & armbar while working on Mankind's fingers to eliminate the mandible claw.  This wasn't their best encounter but it was definately standouts out in a positive way as a different encounter than the rest of the ones in their series.

Elimination Match: Marc Mero, Jake Roberts, The Stalker (Barry Windham), Rocky Maivia vs. Hunter Hearst Hemlsley, Goldust, Jerry Lawler, Crush - Before the match starts, pay close attention to the interaction between HHH & Marlena during the prematch interview as that planted the seeds in the issues between Goldust & HHH that would evolve at the beginning of the next year.  It should also be noted that Sunny joined Ross & McMahon on commentary here that resulted in some bickering between her & Ross while Jake Roberts replaced an injured Mark Henry (the first of many injures in his career).  The main story of this match was the debut of the man we now know as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson but here, he was Rocky Maivia & built as WWE's first 3rd generation athlete taking the combining the names of his grandfather & dad...and it's also ironic that there are 3 other generational wrestlers in this match as well.  This was one of those matches that told various stories such as Hunter avoiding Mero throughout the contest & the issues between Jake Roberts & Jerry Lawler but this was just like the opening match in that this was ultimately a showcase for Rocky but a solid encounter overall.

Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin - Bret Hart's return to WWE after WrestleMania 12 resulted in a lost classic that always gets overshadowed by their submission match at WrestleMania months later. I can try to describe this but this is one of those matches to me where words can't & it's actually my favorite encounter between these two as they put on a wrestling clinic here.  Eventhough Austin winning the King Of The Ring was the match that history says put him on the map, I think this was the match that started to elevate Austin into a superstar.
(Also available on ""The Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin"" DVD)

Elimination Match: Flash Funk, Savio Vega, Jimmy Snuka, Yokozuna vs. Vader, New Razor Ramon, New Diesel, Faarooq - This match featured more debuts & returns than any other match before as the former 2 Cold Scorpio debuted here as the Flash Funk character dancing with his Funkettes, Faarooq debuted his new character & stable called Nation Of Domination complete with Clarence Mason as his manager, Jimmy Snuka returned to the WWF & Madison Square Garden the night after being inducted into the WWF Hall Of Fame the night before, and this would also end up being the last appearence of Yokozuna.  The only things that stood out here was the performance Jimmy Snuka gave at his age (similar to Ricky Steamboat in early '09) along with Yokozuna botching a sidewalk slam that injured Vader (you saw him grabbing his shoulder right away).  Past that, this match wasn't anything special & the ending was just really poor to say the least.

WWF Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Sysco Sid - Shawn Michaels goes against the man he brought into the WWE (twice) & with the NYC crowd always being as vocal as they are, they cheered Sid & booed Shawn who was the top babyface in WWF at that time.  As Jim Ross said during the commentary, ""Shawn Michaels made his money facing bigger guys"" & this was no different as Shawn was WWF's version of WCW's Sting in that he could bring out better performances in bigger men.  He tried to outwrestle Sid & take his legs out at various points while Sid used his power & brawling style.  The big story in this match was the involvement of Jose Lathario & how Shawn sacrificed his championship for Jose resulting in ""The Master & The Ruler Of The World"" becoming ""The Man""...again, to the delight of the MSG crowd.

In the end, this Survivor Series did it's job in establishing, showcasing, and elevating their new talent and with the exception of one of the elimination matches...they were all solid encounters so this is one event worth taking a look at but unless this tape is available at a reasonable price, it's not worth going of your way to see since the match of the night is already available on another DVD set & with WWE starting to release volumes of the Survivor Series Anthology, I would just pick this up as a part of that.",1258329600,,5773,4.634671890303624
7855862,4,6303937470,"Another old tape that I found in my collection as this event always holds dear to my heart as this was the first event that I went to see live. Quick story, while I went to New York to see this event, my dad recorded this event back in Boston in an attempt to see me. Anyways, this was during the time that the WWF was problems against the competition known as WCW but things were really picking up here. There were many wrestlers making their debuts here but the real standout was the return of the legendary Bret ""Hitman"" Hart to battle the man who had been calling him out for months in Stone Cold Steve Austin.

Survivor Series Elimination Match: Doug Furnas, Philip LaFon & The Godwinns vs Owen Hart, The Brtish Bulldog & The New Rockers. This was the debut of the New Japan Pro Wrestling tag team in Furnas & LaFon as they made a good impact in their WWF debut match. A good opening contest with the highlights for me being the interaction between these two along with Owen & Bulldog along with Owen taking a nasty suplex in the end where he literally lands on the top of his head.

The Undertaker vs Mankind. After being Buried Alive the previous month, The Undertaker makes his return with a new outfit to add to it. The stipulation here was that Paul Bearer would be held above the ring in cage & if Taker wins, he would be able to get his hands on Paul Bearer. Undertaker used a much more different style than their previous matches as he did a great job of actually wrestling & breaking Mankind down by using moves like a drop-toll-hold & even attacking Mankind's hand to prevent the mandible claw to the point where he used an armbar while pulling back on the fingers. This was their more unique encounter but a great match nonetheless as this feud was highlight during this time.

Survivor Series Elimination Match: Rocky Maivia, Marc Mero, The Stalker & Jake Roberts vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Goldust, Crush & Jerry Lawler. Jake Roberts was the replacement for the injured Mark Henry as his feud with Lawler was revisted here along with HHH/Mero feud for the Intercontinental title was still being pushed here with one more moment to check out is the interaction between HHH & Marlena that would begin Hunter's new feud with Goldust. However out of all those things, the real highlight was the debut of Rocky Maivia who would gone to greater fame as The Rock. Anyways just like the first Survivor Series match, this was a solid encounter from start to finish.

Bret Hart vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. The return not just to the WWF but to Madison Square Garden for Bret Hart to battle a man looking to make his own piece of history that night. This was my favorite match of the night & one of the best matches of the year as these two put on a wrestling clinic that started off a little slow but gradually began to pick up as time went on with the story being that Austin was trying to beat the energy out of Bret while Bret was able to return the favor in his own right. This is also the match where the moment that Bret was sling-shotted onto the Spanish Announce table that lead to Austin beating him down into the floor. Even though their classic Submission match a couple of months later at WrestleMania is the match that everyone remembers, this was an awesome wrestling match that I think is just as good as that encounter.

Savio Vega, Flash Funk, Yokozuna & Jimmy Snuka vs Vader, Faarooq, fake Razor Ramon & fake Diesel. Another match full of debuts as 2 Cold Scorpio debuted in the WWF as Flash Funk, Faarooq debuted his new faction in the Nation of Domination along with the return for one night only in ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka. One thing I want to mention is that the reason I wrote fake next to the names of Diesel & Razor is that they are not the original characters from Scott Hall & Kevin Nash. This wasn't better than the previous elimination matches as the only highlights here were the performances of Jimmy Snuka & Flash Funk along with Vader actually getting a legit injury at the hands of Yokozuna.

WWF Champion Shawn Michaels vs Sycho Sid. This match clearly proves that Shawn Michaels is capable of a great match with almost anyone & give them one of the best performances in their career...this was no exception. This was one of Sid's best matches in his career as they told a great story of how HBK was trying to use his speed to his advantage along with working on Sid's leg at various points of the match to Sid just using his power to manhandle HBK. However, the real highlight here was the reaction that Shawn got from the MSG crowd to where they completely turned on him to cheer for Sid to the point that the fans cheered despite the way that Sid won the belt that involved Jose Lothario getting hit in the chest with a camera to Shawn getting one as well.

Overall, this was one of the better Survivor Series events that I have seen as most of the matches here were solid & did a great job in pushing all their major storylines for the next PPV. I would recommend this one as this was one of the best events from 1996.",1210550400,,5064,4.398078975453576

Live from Madison Square Garden in NY City

Announcers: Vince McMahon, Jim Ross & The King

1. Survivor Series Elimination Match

Owen Hart, Davey Boy Smith & The New Rockers vs Doug Furnas, Philip LaFon & The Godwinns (***)

- Rockers and Godwinns were eliminated quickly. Basically became a tag match between the 2 good teams in this match. Furnas & LaFon made a nice debut here. Owen was good as always.

2. The Undertaker vs Mankind (**1/2)

- Paul Bearer was in a cage above the ring for this one. Standard UT/Mankind match with the normal sick bumps from Mick. On par with their KOTR 96 match. Crowd was not really into it, which seemed weird.

3. Survivor Series Elimination Match

Rocky Maivia, Marc Mero, Barry Windham & Jake Roberts vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Goldust, Crush & Jerry Lawler (1/2*)

- Unlike the first match, all the good talent was eliminated early in this one. That left Rocky, Goldust and Crush. At 25 minutes, this was very boring. I also hate to see Windham, one of my all-time favorites, looking so terrible. Worst match of the night.

4. Bret Hart vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (*****)

- I almost like this match better than WM 13. The buildup for this was great, the match was great, and of course, the feud that followed was legendary. I'd recommend this show just to see this match.

5. Survivor Series Elimination Match

Faarooq, Vader, Fake Diesel & Fake Razor Ramon vs Yokozuna, Flash Funk, Jimmy Snuka & Savio Vega (*)

- Snuka replaced Mark Henry in this one. Lucky us. Considering the lack of talent here, the match was not as bad as the previous elimination match. Too Cold, er, Flash Funk makes his debut here and pretty much carried the match. DQ ending sucked.

6. WWF Title Match

(C) Shawn Michaels vs Sid Vicious (***1/2)

- Amazing match considering Sid was in it. HBK proves again why he's one of the all time greats. The crowd reaction here is similar to whats been happening to John Cena lately. Shawn got booed throughout while Sid was cheered, even when he cheated. Great ending when Sid used the camera on Shawn and Jose Lothario! Nice way to finish the show, oh wait, Sid is the champ. Oh well, at least it was a good match.

Average match rating was **1/2 which was helped by the fact that there were only 6 matches. But when 4 out of 6 are good to excellent, it's really hard to complain.",1144281600,,2358,4.480093676814988
