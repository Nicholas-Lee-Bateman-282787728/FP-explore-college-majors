5451072,3,B00AMHFMZ4,"I was really impressed with this movie. The movie was good and it had a lot of blood shed. The movie was not what I had expected, especially since I watch a lot of low budget/unknown producers. The quality was also good. I cant remember the guy's name, but he was the guy who was trying to save Cream in the movie. I remember him starring in one of David E Talbert plays. I thought he was a pretty good actor and cute. Really liked the movie. Not appropriate for children.",1367020800,3,472,4.197802197802198
5451073,4,B00AMHFMZ4,"I was really surprised by the quality of the film fist. Most films in this genre are horribly produced. Second, the storyline was actually really good as well. I'd definitely recommend this film.",1366675200,5,195,4.9393939393939394
5451074,5,B00AMHFMZ4,"I saw this when it premiered in Houston. I was blown away. The music, the acting, the story. Wow! It was also cool to see Chico Benymon play a bad guy because he's always playing someone goofy like he did in ""Half & Half"" and ""Steppin'"". He did a great job, though. I would like to see him in more roles like this. Look out for Tonyai Palmer as Vanilla, too. She was so funny. She has a ""memorable"" scene in this movie. Also, the director, Joseph A. Elmore Jr., was fantastic. He knows how to write a compelling movie that makes you want more. His style is urban, but it's fresh. For instance, there's a scene where a guy is getting felatio with a gun pointed at him, and the girl is still going in! Who thinks of that? Joseph A. Elmore Jr. does! He's also a joy to work with.",1362182400,4,776,4.1118421052631575

5451092,2,B00AMHFMZ4,"Predictable and in some scenes unbelievable. I have seen this story before and it was poorly played out in this movie. I applaud the effort to get more African American stories out on film, but don't sell your soul to the devil to do it. All strippers aren't meant to be actresses.",1389312000,,281,4.423076923076923

5451096,3,B00AMHFMZ4,Okay however a long lengthily one. It is not realistic  some sick thoughts went into this one. I watch when I had made time for this one  and that was during a pedi feet treatment. DW MD,1379635200,,186,4.0
5451097,5,B00AMHFMZ4,"Good movie, worth the watch! I may be a little biased, because I know one of the actors, but I enjoyed it nonetheless!!",1378166400,,119,4.217391304347826
5451098,4,B00AMHFMZ4,The acting is sort of bad but the storyline saves the movie.  Better actors and this would have been a hit!,1377302400,,107,4.095238095238095
5451099,3,B00AMHFMZ4,The movie could have been more defined with better character development but overall pretty good story with above average acting considering experience of cast.  Can't wait to see more from this camp.,1376697600,,200,5.25
5451100,4,B00AMHFMZ4,"I enjoyed the Movie! Different concept on a mother (Courtney Cameron) doing what she has to do to care for her child! Single parents have to go thru so much to support our children! This movie touches on that and goes more into the horror of the young mother being kidnapped and herself abused while fighting to get back to her daughter Cookie (Aliyauna NyKol)! Mean while at home the daughter gets to know her father more while being cared for by her other family members. For an Independent Urban film it is done in good high quality, and good story line with some humor thrown in! I loved ""Cookie"" and ""Vanilla"" was a Hoot!

5451101,3,B00AMHFMZ4,"This movie is ok. I enjoyed it. Good story line even though it is too predictable, there was not enough suspense otherwise an ok watch!",1368835200,,135,4.44
5451102,2,B00AMHFMZ4,"Cream (Courtney Cameron) is a stripper involved in a custody battle for her daughter Cookie (Aliyauna NyKol). One night, the place is robbed and she is kidnapped and raped. Adam (Chico Benymon) one of the bad guys is sweet on her and tries to care for her while is is a captive. That's pretty much it.

There isn't much of a story line or message, except maybe killers need love too. The acting was bad and the dialouge was stale.

5451103,1,B00AMHFMZ4,"Bad story line and poor acting (and no nudity if that means anything to you :-).  Story line was simple, predictable, improbable, and just all around bad.  Acting may be better than high school movie projects, but I wouldn't call it good--even when compared to acting in other low-budget independent movies.

I feel like I was tricked into ordering this movie by those with 4-5 star ratings.  This is 1-2 star materials, and it is hard to imagine anyone in their right mind would give it a 3-star.  So I am confident that those that rate it 4-5 stars are those that have stake in movie themselves (i.e. producers, actors/actress, their friends and family, etc...)",1367884800,2,663,4.730434782608696
5451104,4,B00AMHFMZ4,Good story for Indie flick. Had MenaceIISociety feel. Nice action sequences. Enjoyed the striptease. Loved the Cray dude & Vanilla chick. They were very funny. Vanilla even made me wanna to go pee. Ha! Now that's classic.,1367193600,5,221,5.0

I wonder can you tell me how I can get some with bless and faith and love and forgiveness , cherish one another, trust God, never give up, cherish every moment on socks let's take it to another level.
