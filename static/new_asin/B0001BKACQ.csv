8009610,5,B0001BKACQ,"I've been a Ritenour fan since the GRP All Stars at the Record Plant came out in the late 80's.  I have several Ritenour video/dvd's and most of his cd's.  This early concert does not disappoint.  With the welcome talents of Abe Laboriel on bass, Don Grusin on keys, Ernie Watts on sax and a wonderful flute solo by Dave Valentin - there is not a lemon in the mix.  Great camera, great audio, and a great selection of masterful performances make this concert timeless!",1237680000,2,468,4.470588235294118
8009611,5,B0001BKACQ,"This DVD is excellent. The video and sound are very good for 1991. Abe Laboriel on bass is awesome,and Gary Novak on drums is too. I recommended this dvd. Is the best of Lee. Buy it.",1121644800,7,182,4.083333333333333
8009612,5,B0001BKACQ,"This is one of the most enjoyable concerts you could ever ask for!. Recorded in 1991, this DVD is awesome not only for the music itself, but the sound and image. At last a Rit's concert in DTS!!!!
It's really nice the title of the DVD because we can find the best muscicians.
Lee Ritenour (Guitars)
David Benoit (Keyboards)
Don Grusin (Keyboards)
Ernie Watts (Sax)
Abraham Laboriel (Bass), personally I'm very proud of Abe because he plays extremly extraordinary and he is mexican like me!!
Gary Novak (Drums)
This DVD features 8 incredible songs, 5 of them are Ritenour's originals.
1. Night Rhythms (Lee Ritenour).
Opening track, his Sadowsky Electric/classic guitar sound perfect, Rit show his skill with his instrument and show why his nick name is ""Captain Fingers""
2. 24th Street Blues (Lee ritenour).
Really nice song.
3. Solo Flute (Dave Valentin) and yes, Image had a mistake, is Awakening.
Well, Dave Valentin is for me the best flutist in the entire world and we can see and hear a lot of his flutes here.
4. Zephyr (Don Grusin).
5. Rio Sol (Tim Landers) Yes, again Image had another mistake, it's not a Rit's original.
Rit used here his Gibson ES335 and changes a bit the song by adding some rock instead the brazilian flavor it had back in 1988 on the Festival album. For me is one of the best songs in this concert.
6. Etude (Lee Ritenour).
Wonderful as always this particular song, a really complex song for be played lived.
7. Uptown (Lee Ritenour).
Excellent song.
Captain Fingers again, jaja!
8. Rio Funk (Lee Ritenour).
Wow, incredible song apropriated for incredible muscicians. All of the guests play in this song that misteriously appear in almost all the lived performances.
This DVD is a must have for all Rit's fans.",1081209600,34,1741,4.749174917491749
