7991830,5,B00009MGGA,"Hopefully you know the story of this film. If not, I am sure you have heard of the Hollywood version ALIVE. This Mexican version from 1976 blows away the glossy Hollywood version! It is interesting that this clocks in right under two hours and when released here in states as SURVIVE! it ran under 90 minutes. I am sure that back in '76 American distributor was cashing in on the exploitation element of the film. It was popular at drive-ins here in the south, for its cannibalism elements. But this version from Urban Vision seems to be the better choice when viewing this classic (although its long running time) it just seems more complete in this form. It is in original Mexican dialog with English subtitles burned in the video (so you can't switch them off). The video is presented in 4x3 full frame format. This doesn't' really hurt this presentation in any way (in fact, it gives it more of a documentary feel to what you are seeing). If you can get it cheap enough, and if you know the story, this is a good find. Wouldn't waste my time on the truncated version, now that this version is out there. Grab a copy while you can!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survive-Supervivientes-de-los-Andes/dp/B00009MGGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survive (Supervivientes de los Andes)</a>",1298073600,,1322,5.153488372093023
7991831,3,B00009MGGA,"I've always enjoyed this film and my hope is that one day sooner than later someone reissues this DVD in the correct aspect ratio. I would've rated this Rene Cardona, Jr. film at 4 or 5 stars if I felt the ratio and quality was correct.",1208822400,4,236,4.1521739130434785
7991832,5,B00009MGGA,"WOW I remember watching Los Supervivientes De Los Andes as I knew it like it was last night, been at home having dinner and watchin this back home, I remember I couldn't sleep that night after I watched this, and never able to find it or watch it again till now, I also watched the documentary about the survivers and was great then I saw ALIVE what a piece of crap don't waist your time watching ALIVE... This is a great movie just don't forget that they didn't have the budge that a studio have now in days for its time is a great movie!",1191283200,4,539,4.142857142857143
7991833,1,B00009MGGA,"Like most people I remember this film as a Sunday night movie on A.B.C. and at the time I felt it was OK, but after watching this disc I have questioned my own taste. this should be called ""The National Enquirer Presents Survive"" as it wallows in the most debased, sick, and horrible part of the story. There is an almost loving scene of the group slicing meat off the dead that is horrible. The story is better told and better acted in the movie ""Alive""! Skip this trash.",1185148800,4,472,4.314606741573034
7991834,1,B00009MGGA,"I have only seen bits and pieces of this awful piece of trash,but that's enough to scar you for LIFE!!!I'm warning you,in the first 15 minutes you see an unfortunate soul get a metal rod impaled in his stomach,which another survivor must pull out immediately,and you get to see the wonderful image of his stomach popping out through his skin. The acting is terrible,the music sickeningly maudlin and the cannibalism is absolutely tasteless and gross. If you enjoy this movie you might have serious psychological problems. In my opinion,this film should be banned. God Bless America!!!",1177718400,3,584,5.09375
7991835,1,B00009MGGA,"If, like me, you enjoyed the 1977 ABC movie, co-produced by Robert Stigwood, with a snappy, catchy music score by Gerald Fried, and DUBBED INTO ENGLISH, including fascinating geographical and aeronautical narration about flying over the Andes, you will be disappointed. This is the same made-in-Mexico movie, but a vastly different edition. It is in Spanish with English subtitles, all narration is stripped away, and instead of Gerald Fried's gripping music score, there is merely whooshing-wind sound effects by a musical mediocrity named Raul Lavista. What a pity, the nicely trimmed-up, filled-out, tuneful 1977 ABC version replaced by this dreary, boresome ain't-cannibalism-groovy pseudo-novelty. I say skip the purchase and hope that Singa Home Entertainment brings out the ABC broadcast version.",1142208000,9,803,5.7
7991836,4,B00009MGGA,"The print on the new DVD of ""SURVIVE - Supervivientes de los Andes"" is the original uncut version of the film. The case indicates the running time as 103 minutes, but the film actually clocks in closer to 112 minutes(!). That's almost 1/2 hour longer than the original dubbed US version. I noticed several extra bits without doing a side-by-side - I think the initial skinning scene is slightly longer, there's another quick shot of a different body being skinned later on as well as some nasty business with an infected leg, and some of the trekking scenes and segments with the parents seem extended. This is all from memory, however - a researched breakdown of all the differences would definitely be a worthwhile undertaking. I was also surprised at how well the film actually holds up (especially in this original-language version) - definitely not as 'exploitative' as the American print always felt. Unfortunately, the low-budget still mars the crash scene as well as all the studio-shot scenes outside of the wrecked plane (can that snow be any more fake?), but the scenes shot on location are quite good as is the editing, music, and acting.
The print used on the DVD doesn't appear to have been 'remastered' in any way, but it looks decent enough. There are some lines here and there and some other flaws, but nothing really distracting. It's presented full-frame only and the english subtitles are burned-in. The DVD has the original spanish-trailer for the film, which does not shy away from indicating that it's about cannibalism, as well as two other trailers for other Urban Vision latin films.
Definitely a worthy purchase for fans of the film. It would still be great to get the modified American version some day, as well.",1082592000,16,1740,4.861952861952862
