7814874,5,6301699548,"Focus on the Family always has great story lines.  This one is high adventure, live action - combined with animation!! In The Big Lie, Nicholas and McGee discover that telling lies is not a convenient way to make friends.  Instead, it's a sure way to hurt other, especially if the lie is mistaken from the truth.  Finally, entertainment with the excitement kids love to watch and the biblical values parents want their kids to learn. This is a MUST HAVE!!",1207267200,2,455,4.6625
