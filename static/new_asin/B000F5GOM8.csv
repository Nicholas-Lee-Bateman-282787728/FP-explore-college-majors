8176672,1,B000F5GOM8,"One of the worst films of an opera production I have ever seen. The self-important video director Chloe Perlemuter thinks that close-ups of fabric or hands are more significant than a view of the stage or the movement of the singers in relation to each other.  This production is directed by the great English theatrical director Jonathan Miller which is why I bought it.  But Perelmuter, calling his production ""minimalist"", apparently thinks she need pay no attention to it.  Great arias are filmed as though they were about details of costume.  Pasha Selim played by the actor Klaus Maria Brandauer is treated to innumerable and boring facial close-ups while his bodily movements and gestures are almost always out of the view of the cameras--a real disservice to him and Jonathan Miller.  The performance is well sung and played but from my point of view almost unwatchable because of the willful self-involved video director. You can find very similar comments about the inept video direction of Perlemuter in her version of Wagner's Tannhauser from Zurich.",1437955200,,1062,5.080459770114943
