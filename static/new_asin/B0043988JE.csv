8414378,5,B0043988JE,"Guyver is an anime adaptation of a 1980's manga and an early 1990's Mark Hamill movie. Sadly the movie was dumb. Imagine Mark Hamill as a power ranger. That's pretty much the size of it. The anime is a different story. I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.

I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored. It's not exactly one of the better anime titles out there, but it's still a lot of fun. I recommend giving it a try. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1353369600,,781,4.241610738255034
8414379,2,B0043988JE,"The series comes in a neat package. Four discs in a regular dvd case with cool art work. The series itself is okay, but only if you're like the biggest Guyver fan ever. It relies heavy on drama and most times it feels like nothing really happens between episodes. I don't know about you but I wasn't expecting this from a series advertised as THE NEW FACE OF ULTRA VIOLENCE! Sure, we're treated to a few action scenes but they're too few and far between.

Then theres a list of pointless and annoying characters. Tetsuro has this homoerotic relationship with Sho, the main guy, similar to that of Samwise and Frodo. You see him overreacting to everything and overprotecting Sho, THE FREAKIN' GUYVER! The guy acts like he knows about stuff but you really get a feeling that he's a dumb@$$. His sister and our hero's love interest, Mizuki, cries and cries and cries about everything. That can be quite annoying. Especially if we spend a whole episode watching her cry and her brother trying to act tough. Then there's an oldman and some chick who used to work for Agito, Guyver III (that's the darker Guyver that appears in the background of the cover art. They're as useful as the apendix.

My advise, try to get the original 12 part OVA series. Definitely a lot of fun. It's incomplete, but then again, so is this series. That's another thing I've never understood. Why start something if you can't finish it? I know the manga is ongoing but it's just ridiculous to leave us hanging like that. On second thought, I don't really care anymore about this snoozefest. Heck, even the live action movies are better.",1294790400,4,1609,4.6223776223776225
