5974461,2,B00FBQQN1I,"Love The Newsroom. Piers Morgan asks a lot of useless, self serving questions. Olivia Munn is wonderful as she tries to keep her grace even as she seems to really want to tell Morgan what a tool he is.",1384473600,22,201,4.17948717948718
5974462,2,B00FBQQN1I,"Although I am a fan of the Paleyfest sessions, and a fan of The Newsroom, I was very disappointed in this session. Rather than talking to the actors about their roles, the production, etc., the host treated the actors as if they were real journalists and presented questions that should have been reserved for journalists, not actors. I did not watch the video to completion because it simply was not what I thought it should have been.",1384387200,16,436,4.675324675324675
5974463,5,B00FBQQN1I,"It's fascinating watching the moderator constantly forgetting that he's interviewing celebrities and not news people. It's also fascinating watching the celebrities endure his ridiculous and self  serving questions. But if you endure you'll get some nice moments with the great cast, writer, and producer. Worth your time.

The only drawback to Paleyfest is having a character crush destroyed (yes, Abbie, I'm looking at you). No problem here.

Now go watch some of The Newsroom.",1384300800,,479,5.445945945945946
5974464,5,B00FBQQN1I,"Watching the cast, the producer, and Mr. Sorkin being interviewed by Piers Morgan was delightful.  Morgan does his usual good job and managed to get around to everybody.  My only observation/complaint:  I just wish they had had more time.",1382918400,2,238,5.051282051282051
5974465,4,B00FBQQN1I,"These guys spend a lot of time being critical about the media, saying that they should just report the news, yet isn't being an actor and speaking out about how the media is being a hypocritical?  I agree with the thought, but then I thought about that and it seems to be true.  I do think that these actors were selected correctly for these roles-- they fit them well even off character.",1382486400,,388,4.375
5974466,5,B00FBQQN1I,Love anything that has to do with The Newsroom.  Especially Sam Waterston.  Can't wait until the second season is out so that I can buy it too.,1382140800,,143,4.2592592592592595
5974467,4,B00FBQQN1I,"If you are at all  ""Newsroom"" fan, well worth time to watch Pierce (?) Morgan's moderation of cast in the major roles.",1382140800,,118,4.363636363636363
5974468,5,B00FBQQN1I,"This program brings all of the key characters plus the writer (Sorkin) and the director to the stage.  Piers Morgan is far too interested in what he has to say rather than asking questions of the assembled group, but even so, the session is very interesting and informative about what has gone into making the show.",1381708800,2,315,4.625
5974479,5,B00FBQQN1I,Loved this show more than anything.  Was devastated that it was cancelled.  Just listening to this show reminded me of how incredibly smart Aaron Sorkin is and what talented actors were on this show.,1465084800,2,199,4.823529411764706

5974484,4,B00FBQQN1I,"Piers Morgan certainly could have asked better questions in many cases. However, if you're a big ""The Newsroom"" fan and own all the episodes, this makes a good addition to that collection.",1461024000,,188,4.90625
5974485,5,B00FBQQN1I,"The Brit was more interested in talking about himself, his show, his network.  It was only when members of the audience were allowed questions did it truly become about the cast, producers, writer, etc. Rather than Mr. Morgan.",1457654400,,226,4.947368421052632
5974486,1,B00FBQQN1I,"Absolutely loved the show, was very sad that it ended so soon.  So I had high enough hopes that this would be enjoyable to learn more of the thinking behind the show.  However I do not think there was room on the stage for the actors after Piers and his ego!  It was a horrible display of ""look at me"" and the actors were unfortunately dragged into this.  Not worth the time unless you love a 'good' ego or Piers.",1457049600,,413,4.125

5974500,5,B00FBQQN1I,"Absolutely one of the best shows I have had the pleasure of viewing over the past few years.  I am a big fan of Downington Abby and this TV series ranks right up there with Downington Abby.  The acting is excellent, the story line keeps me coming back for more.

5974505,4,B00FBQQN1I,"It was nice to see and hear interviews with the cast members. This was an intelligent bunch of cast members and their respective takes on how they viewed their roles and felt about their characters  made for interesting viewing especially since I have seen the complete seasons and knowing how it concluded. I really miss the series and hope that HBO will consider bringing it back,",1449014400,2,382,4.787878787878788

5974524,4,B00FBQQN1I,"As a fan of The Newsroom, I found this fun, interesting and entertaining.  But host Piers Morgan seemed to forget that these were basically actors he was interviewing, not journalists.  Many of his questions focused on questions of journalistic ethics and behavior that were inappropriate for the assembled cast.  Jeff Daniel (characteristically) seemed to note this when he responded to one such complex question by basically saying, ""Gee, I have no idea.""  Still, lot of good dialogue and fun to see some of favorite actors talking about their craft.",1444953600,3,552,5.168539325842697

5974540,5,B00FBQQN1I,"Love the cast, and their tidbits about behind-the-scenes and their experiences with working on the show.
The only thing about this session is the interviewer (ahem, Piers Morgan), sometimes focuses too much on the characters of the show, rather than the actors themselves. I think he was really looking for their opinions on him as an anchor or CNN as a network. It seemed as though Piers wanted to justify himself through this interview session, speaking a lot more than the actors. In any case, he was polite and clearly loved the show himself.",1442966400,,546,4.819148936170213
5974541,5,B00FBQQN1I,"We enjoyed streaming The Newsroom, and couldn't get enough!  The next ""must watch"" was Paleyfest for it.  Loved finding out about the series and listening the actors that did such a wonderful job portraying the characters on the series.",1442361600,2,236,5.0256410256410255

5974546,4,B00FBQQN1I,Not quite as good as Sorkin's West Wing but still a good series. Maybe a little too much silly romantics but the basic cable news story line was good.,1441584000,,150,4.206896551724138

5974568,5,B00FBQQN1I,"If you loved The Newsroom you will love this Paleyfest DVD of the cast and Aaron Sorkin discussing the show. Insightful and entertaining, it was a great addition to my DVD collection of the three seasons of the show.?",1439337600,,217,4.589743589743589

5974581,4,B00FBQQN1I,"This was a great watch.  You get to know the actors a little better, and then you get to listen to Aaron Sorkin and learn more about his process of writing and story-telling.  Aaron Sorkin is the best at what he does.  I don't believe he has a peer.  Other reviewers should just get over Piers Morgan.  Everyone who interviews has an agenda, and why shouldn't he.  His questions about how the actors would handle actual so-called news situations, was generally because this TV show is itself about the so-called news.  The actors, handled his questions and the topic brilliantly, and this was worth watching.  I didn't realize from the show, how intelligent each actor is, but each has an incredible depth of understanding.  I will watch season 3 from a different perspective, due to this interview.  I wish it were longer, so there was more time with each actor.  I am very happy I bought it.",1428796800,10,893,4.624203821656051

5974592,3,B00FBQQN1I,"Love The Newsroom and the cast, buy unfortunately Piers Morgan is horrible.  He single handedly ruined this panel session.  He tried to make the session about him, and his views on the news, not making it about the show and some of the behind the scenes processes.  Piers, this is meant to be fun...

Despite all that, many of the cast do great hobs answering his horrible questions.  In particular Olivia Munn, she is a very aware intelligence woman.",1424390400,,451,4.658227848101266

5974614,3,B00FBQQN1I,"Wow, Piers Morgan really exemplifies the egotistical self-serving type of news personality that he claims to be trying not to be. His questions to this panel so often had precious little to do with the production of the show, incredibly asking the actors to comment on his profession in detail. It was as though he were saying, ""But enough about me, what do you think of me?""
In spite of that, this is a show I am a great fan of, produced by talented and interesting people all working at a very high level within their professions and what little of that information about them that leaked through is worth watching this for. It must be a challenge for Paley Center to get good moderators because they fail so spectacularly sometimes; on the other hand, I would have expected more of a professional of Mr. Morgan's stature than he delivered here, so perhaps they did too. Next time I hope they get a moderator who understands the Paley Center panels better, e.g., Matt Mitovich whom I feel did an excellent job at the recent NYC interviews.",1414713600,,1041,4.602150537634409

5974619,5,B00FBQQN1I,"If you like the Newsroom, you will love this panel discussion.  If you think the creator of this series, as well as The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin, is a genius, as I do, you will love hearing him talk about the cast of this show.  The eight actors who make up the regular cast are all talented and lovable!  The issues in the  actual news in previous months make up the ""reality"" of this cable news program.  For those of us who watch cable news, it is a fascinating look behind the scene of how a program is put together.  And while real issues are broadcast, the romances and problems of the news staff give it originality and levity.

5974622,5,B00FBQQN1I,"This is a great chance to hear Aaron Sorkin talk about his show, and a great chance to hear the terrific cast acknowledge their characters.  Oliva Munn is a stand-out, very articulate and interesting.  I know someone groused about the questions posed as if the ACTORS are actual newsmen instead of merely actors, but there were only a couple of those questions (which I blamed on Piers Morgan and not on the cast) and the actors seemed to do a good job of redirecting the conversation.  Very enjoyable!!  Definitely added to my pleasure in watching The Newsroom.",1398988800,5,562,4.762886597938144
5974633,5,B00FBQQN1I,"I have only lately become a fan of the Newsroom series, and when I found this show on the cast and creators, I was eager to watch it.  I found it to be beyond my expectations.  I already love the characters in the series, and to see ""behind the curtains"" was a true delight.  One gets a good view of how the cast members interact with one another, their sense of humor, and, above all, the dedication of both cast and creators to the subject matter.  It is an inspiration to find an intelligently written script that is both absorbing and fun to watch.",1397260800,,552,4.278846153846154

Great quality DVD, almost looks like a BluRay.",1391212800,,264,5.285714285714286
5974638,2,B00FBQQN1I,"The Newsroom is an all-time favorite show. But this interview with cast members was frightfully dull, uninspired, and unenlightening. Even if you love the show, skip it.(I wonder if Aaron Sorkin was as embarrassed by his smug self-satisfaction as I was embarrassed for him. Most cast members didn't come off as looking as intelligent as they thought of themselves, either.)",1389398400,,373,5.233333333333333
5974639,4,B00FBQQN1I,"I too feel that Pierce Morgan is such a narcissist that he could only see the actors through HIS lense of a newsman and therefore asked inane questions based on their knowledge of cable news instead of their skills, understanding of their roles as actors!  That unfortuately is the burden that this wonderful show and these amazing actors face regularly due to the ""civil war"" polarization that is rampant presently in America and does not allow viewers, reviewers to wrap their brains around the fact that this is a TV Show! and not a documentary.  That said, theses actors and actresses rose to to the occasion and at times reminded Pierce about the fact that they are actors or broaden their answers to get to the heart of the matter: the extraordinary writing, superb acting and amazing connection between them on and off camera! God bless the woman who asked the best question of the night, i.e., Why is America....?  Newsroom brings a Broadway level of acting and writing into your home every episode.  Waiting very impatiently for Season Three!!!",1388880000,,1053,4.833333333333333

5974641,1,B00FBQQN1I,"Piers Morgan was the WORST choice for an interviewer EVER.  He could not get into his head that they are ACTORS, not real news people.  All he wanted to talk about was the news instead of letting us get to know about the behind the scenes of the show, personalities of the actors, etc.  Piers Morgan is very self indulgent, and talks too much.  It was very boring, and it could been so good with someone else doing the interview.  Since I am a Prime member, it was free.  I would've wanted my money back if I'd paid for it.",1387152000,24,523,4.18

8614179,5,B00FBQQN1I,"Anything about The Newsroom, I love. It's a shame the show ended as it did. I don't think Sorkin will ever have a better collection of actors to do it the exact way he wanted it. These actors really put in the time and it's great to listen to them speak about it. Every time I rewatch the series, I think, what could have been? Honestly, this is Sorkin at his best.

Bring The Newsroom back!",1520121600,,391,4.144736842105263
