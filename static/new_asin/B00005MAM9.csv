1624210,5,B00005MAM9,"At first blush, Nero Wolfe seems the very reincarnation of Sherlock Holmes' smarter brother. Wolfe's corpulence, indolence, sagacity, and appreciation for the finer things of life can come only from the model of Mycroft Holmes.  But Wolfe is more complex than that.  On a second look, he might be Dashiel Hammet's Continental Op, finally grown too fat to continue field work.  (The Continental Op is the Man With No Name, who served as the model for Bruce Willis' character in ""Last Man Standing"").
It's easier to recognize the complexity of Archie Goodwin's antecedents. He has the energy of Sherlock Holmes, the loyalty of Dr. Watson, the wit of Philip Marlowe, and the gritty toughness of Sam Spade.
In ""The Doorbell Rang"" these two do something that was unheard of in 1965 when the story was written--they take on the FBI. Their client is being stalked by agents of the FBI, and they must stop it. Incidentally, they have to solve a murder in which the prime suspects are three FBI agents.
They solve the mystery, cage the FBI's dogs, earn their obscene fee, and nobody but the viewer lives happily ever after.
This video was my second taste of Nero Wolfe, the first being ""Cop Killer,"" an audiobook from Durkin Hayes (available on Amazon.com).  It appeared on A&E as a two part serial.  I viewed the first episode and missed the second.  The mystery so intrigued me, I could not wait for the rerun.  I bought the book on Amazon.com and read it in one sitting.  You can bet I had my VCR set for the rerun.
Wolfe in print takes a little getting used to.  Wolfe on video is loveable from the start.  The fine nuances of Wolfe's character, and his admirable qualities, are not as readily discernible from the books as they are from the A&E productions.  It takes at least three written Wolfe stories to get the reader hooked, one video will do.  Long may the A&E series run.",1027036800,7,1875,4.614457831325301

7945026,5,B00005MAM9,"This was a great deal and a very good value!!! I enjoy the Nero Wolfe series, and I have to say this is one of the best episodes and is a great addition to my collection.  The seller was excellent; I received it quickly.  As Nero would say this was, ""very satisfactory""!",1367625600,,270,4.173076923076923
7945027,5,B00005MAM9,"I lost a copy of this video during a move and realized it quite a while later. I searched about for a replacement copy and found this on Amazon. I have some other A&E dvds and at least one of them was a poorly cut version of another series title, so I was conserned about the quality of the story, itself. But this one seems to be quite nicely cut. The DVD itself was as described and I am quite pleased with this purchase. It shipped rapidly and arrived well packaged, safe and sound.",1341532800,,485,4.170212765957447
7945028,5,B00005MAM9,"I have read the majority of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe mysteries.  Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin are excellent actors for the character's of Archie and Wolfe.  (Chaykin will be missed)  I watched the series and was very impressed.  I have VHS tapes of some of the installments and wanted DVDs.  This initial production is well done, sets the characters, and follows the book well.  If you like Stout and Wolfe - excellent adaptation.
Prior to purchase I wanted to ensure I would be receiving a DVD and not a VHS tape.  Easily identified and accepted. Other productions are available but this start is PRIME!",1334275200,,606,4.769230769230769

7945030,5,B00005MAM9,"A&E was foolish in failing to keep this series going.  It was, with little exception, excellent.  The first in the series, ""Golden Spiders"" was a little clumsy but by the second story they were up and running.  ""The Doorbell Rang"" was one of the Best.  Leg man extraordinary, Archie Goodwin, and his rotund genius of a boss, Nero Wolfe, lock horns with the untouchable FBI.  Many is the time when a great book is turned into a disappointing movie.  Not so with ""The Doorbell Rang"", it is an excellent way to spend an evening.",1309651200,6,525,4.531914893617022
7945031,5,B00005MAM9,"When this series first aired, I quickly became hooked, and it inspired me to read some of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe mysteries.
""The Doorbell Rang"" is great entertainment, and a great example of what to expect from the rest of the series. It is faithful to Stout's novel.
If you are unfamiliar with Nero Wolfe, and are looking for entertainment that is more cerebral than the car crashes and explosions that pass for entertainment today, I think you'd be satisfied.",1211500800,14,461,4.775
7945032,5,B00005MAM9,"This is the first selection in Volume One of the two-part Nero Wolfe series.  I do not know why it was issued separately.  For those who want a taste of the larger series, here is an inexpensive way to see Wolfe at his very best.  First class in every way.",1128211200,11,256,4.08
7945033,5,B00005MAM9,"Everything about this episode (as with all the others in the series)--from the music to the cinematography, the set to the costume design, the casting, the directing, and certainly the acting--is absolutely great. The attention to detail is wonderful. Like a fine painting, it bears re-study time and time again. Upon each return, one is likely to discover yet another detail, yet another facet of this rare and precious gem. Timothy Hutton (Archie, director, and co-executive producer), Maury Chaykin (Wolfe), Michael Small (music) and everyone involved should be very proud.",1044230400,3,576,5.411111111111111
7945034,5,B00005MAM9,"In this, the second of A & E's adaptations of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe mysteries, the cast and crew settle in and really deliver the goods.
Maury Chaykin is, as he was in the first adaptation, The Golden Spiders, perfect as the title character.  He can do wrong on screen (one wonders what Rex Stout would make of this were the author alive today?).  Timothy Hutton has really discovered what makes the character of Archie Goodwin tick and the chemistry between the two captures the essence of the relationship as seen in the novels.  Wolfe and Archie are classic detective characters. Wolfe has his roots in the English ""Drawing Room"" mystery and Archie with antecendants in the American ""Hard Boiled"" school...but these characters, and their multi-layered interactions, grew far beyond that into something truly unique.  And it's all up there on screen for us to enjoy time and again.
The telefilm also features one of Stout's most complex and intense plots as Wolfe is hired to tackle J. Edgar Hoover's FBI on behalf of a wealthy client.  Can Wolfe's genius prove greater than his hubris?
Watch out for a classic scene between Inspector Lionel T. Cramer (well played by Bill Smitrovich) and Archie!",1037577600,4,1199,4.886699507389163
