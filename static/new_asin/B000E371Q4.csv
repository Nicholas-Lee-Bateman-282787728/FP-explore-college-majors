A rip off
Typical shoddy History Channel work.",1382572800,,196,4.157894736842105
8104704,5,B000E371Q4,"I love this video and use it in my WWII class.  It does a wonderful job of encapsulating the Great War into a usable video.  Playing off the theme of glory in warfare, the writers show how modern warfare, tactics, and industrialization stripped the concept of glory away.  The video moves quickly and picks up key events and has lots of good pictures and film.  Since it is a short film, it lacks the grandeur of other videos such as PBS's The Great War and some of the other longer series.  But for classroom purposes, this is a keeper.  I have a worksheet I use with it for my class.",1363651200,2,585,4.2727272727272725
8104705,5,B000E371Q4,"""The Death of Glory"" should be judged on what it is, not on what it is not. It is not a social history of civilians during World War I. It is a diplomatic and military history of that war, and as such, succeeds completely.

It is full of the little anecdotes and memorable phrases that personalize the story for the viewer. The producers have made use of an impressive array of archival footage, although it should be noted that some clips are used multiple times. They have called on a panel of well-regarded and highly qualified experts for analysis and insights. These commentators do a remarkable job of making the war come alive. ""People were full of the notion of sacrifice,"" says Robert Cowley right at the beginning, ""and God did they sacrifice."" He sets the tone for the film: honest outrage at bungled operations and lost opportunities balanced with a sensitive, thorough and detailed retelling of the war itself.

Many of my students enter the university with a deficiency in their knowledge and understanding of World War I. This is the film I have them watch to make up that deficiency. I recommend it in the highest terms.",1243900800,6,1136,4.703517587939698
8104706,1,B000E371Q4,"The Death of Glory was disappointing in that the human side of the conflict, not just the soldiers in the trenches, but also the impact on the civilian population and the tremendous changes in the very culutre of European did not come through.  We are within five years of the one hundreth anniversary of the war that still resonates in the 21st century.  Some of the hotspots today are all too familiar or had their start in the world war that opened the 20th century.  The Middle East is a perfect example.  The creation of the present nation-states were the direct result of the war.  The struggle over natural resources and strategic geography concerns both major and minor powers.  To a great writer, an imaginative doumentary producer, and with the dedication to presenting the color, heartbreak, dramatic changes, and the enduring legacy, World War I remains an area that has not received its proper representation.",1239148800,4,922,4.916129032258064
