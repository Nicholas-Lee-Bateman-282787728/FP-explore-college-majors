6041275,5,B00FZ5DMM8,"Beautiful animation and biblically sound.  The theology is deep but right on, probably appropriate for age minimum of 4 but my 3 yr old daughter loves them. I really don't think she grasps all the teaching but that's quite alright, she probably soaks in more than what I realize as kiddos usually do!",1454371200,4,300,4.660377358490566
6041296,5,B00FZ5DMM8,My kids absolutely love this. I only wish the episodes were longer. I've already bought it as a gift for my God son.,1488585600,,116,4.086956521739131

6041301,5,B00FZ5DMM8,I think the Theo series is a wonderful series.  It teaches God's word well without watering down or missing the point of scripture as many biblical cartoon series do.,1478649600,,166,4.724137931034483
6041302,5,B00FZ5DMM8,"These are truly the best kids videos!! My husband and I love watching them with our kids! They are Biblically accurate, and hold your attention really well. Only 10 or so minutes each, with 3 per dvd. We can watch these for free online with a Christian movie subscription we have, but loved them so much we wanted our kids to be able to watch them anytime. Also, because of how clearly they represent the word, we have used them every now and then with our Sunday school students to get a better, more clear picture of what we're teaching!! I highly recommend them!!",1475625600,3,566,4.451923076923077

6041304,5,B00FZ5DMM8,"Love this series! Mother of 4 ages 5,8,10,14 here.
The younger three really like the video, I have always done a bible study of some sort with my kids so it wasn't hard to make my 14 yr old join in.
My kids love it , they ask every day when can we watch it. When I sampled the DVD on YouTube my 8 year old begged me to get it. I'm a homeschool mom , so I'm a tough critic we have a pretty busy schedule between school and sports during The week, so when I find something that I feel is time well spent  I get excited about it.
The videos are about 11 minutes long , each video is a lesson with a study guide for a 6 day study complete with discussion topics and devotionals. With the suggested bible reading we can spend up to 45 minutes each morning on the study . I have my kids watch the same video each day for 6 days, the repetition helps them to become familiar with the truths of the gospel that are being taught, the teachings are biblically sound And I'm learning and gleaning from it too.
My kids are excited to move on to the next cartoon, but are waiting patiently. There are also extras on the DVDs that shares with you how the cartoonist draw the characters and, a step by step to follow if your kids want to try to draw Luther or belfry the mice. I would recommend this to anyone with children age 10 and under.
With all the hype that Disney brings for our little ones with cute little characters to fall in love with I'm excited to see such great quality here to compete with, I even bought the plush dolls at theopresents.com for my 5 year old. I love that it's making a big deal of the gospel.
And if you fear your kids will reject it don't , your kids tend to love what you love so just go for it! And they will follow their leader.
