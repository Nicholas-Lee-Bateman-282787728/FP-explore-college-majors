8334468,3,B001PRP8RM,"Great Movie! Unfortunately very low quality video and audio and the movie is Spanish only (no subtitles or audio options) . I remember seeing this movie in an art house and it stuck with me, Goitia is one of my favorite Mexican painters and well deserves a Bio movie, but no Bio movie is perfect and this is has its flaws. I would give the movie 4 out of 5 stars and the A&V quality 2 out of 5 stars. I would love a better quality version or a remastering of this movie but I'm sure that's not going to happen so for now I can at least enjoy this copy.",1503100800,,552,3.981981981981982
