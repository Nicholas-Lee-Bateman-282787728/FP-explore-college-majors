8621415,5,B00G9A7986,"""Hats off, Gentlemen..."" Flawless, engaging, educational and scholarly. These Exhibition on Screen series by Phil Grabsky and Tim Marlow are an important way of seeing the great art masterpieces through the media of High Quality DVD's at the comfort of your home. The most important thing is that these masterpieces of art can be revisited again and again. The more one sees these series, the more one learns and finds out always something new. Superb. I just waiting in anticipation to see Leonardo Live. Thank you very much.",1407715200,2,526,4.988636363636363
