2909035,5,B000TR7ZKC,"I just saw this a couple of nights ago. I've seen Brian live twice and have loved his other recordings (DVD and CD). This is right up there with the best. Some completely new things and some familar things too (but changed up just enough to be fresh - I liked the new twists on a couple things I have seen/heard him do in the past).

""I Walked on the Moon"" is a great addition to his collection. Highly recommended.",1215734400,3,415,4.1875

2909037,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Its not because he is funny as hell. Its not because your entire family can watch and laugh. Its not because his mannerisms are LOL funny. Its not because of his delivery.

Its all of the above.

I visited my eye doctor last year and almost cracked up laughing. I know from now on, its going to hard for me to shop for a refrigerator, visit my doctor, have a normal conversation with my phone company, let alone look at an ironing board again, without chuckling to myself.

Cannot wait for a dvd of ""All by Myself""",1375660800,,217,4.023255813953488
2909057,4,B000TR7ZKC,"Four stars! Two enthusiastic thumbs up!

This review is for people who already know that Brian Regan is hilarious. In fact, you've probably already seen this hour of standup and know it's one of the best comedy specials ever recorded and are considering buying the DVD. As far as content goes, this special gets five stars.

As for the DVD, I'm taking one star off for a couple reasons. First, the DVD has no extras. You can watch the whole special, or you can watch individual bits. This isn't a huge deal, but for $30, I was hoping for something extra. The DVD does come with a paper insert that includes short descriptions of where each bit came from, written by Mr. Regan. If you're a big Regan fan, this is ""a very nice touch."" The DVD case and artwork looks nicer than that found on most comedy DVDs and you can tell he was proud of his work and took the time to make everything about this DVD look nice. The video quality of the DVD is, for the most part, great. Almost every minute of the special looks near blu-ray quality on my TV, which has a good DVD upscaler. However, there are a few shots that seem to have gotten messed up and look a little blurry - they don't last long, but it is distracting and could be a little disappointing if you were hoping for perfect video quality. The sound quality is good and the man in the audience with the annoying laugh (some of you may know what I'm talking about - he sounds like he's forcing laughter out of his body at gunpoint) is less audible on the DVD than it is on pirated versions of this special.

Overall, there's no reason not to buy this DVD. The product isn't perfect, but the comedy will someday be considered classic, Mr. Regan's best work to date, and one of the funniest hours of standup that exists, clean or otherwise.

*(Note about buying from his website) It's true that you can buy this DVD from his official website for cheaper, but they charge a ton for shipping and you only end up saving about two bucks in the end. Also, there's no expedited shipping through his website so you have to wait up to 10 days. If you have Amazon Prime, I would recommend just buying it from Amazon because it's only a little more, you'll get it right away, and you don't have to put all your information into a new system.",1374451200,3,2280,4.320093457943925
2909058,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Zero swearing or foul subjects AND a laugh riot? YES. I had never heard of this guy so when my sister suggested watching it at her house I was worried about enduring an hour of torture. However, I laughed myself crazy. Had to be careful not to choke on my snacks. Bought this copy as soon as I got home and have shared it with many friends that loved the humor too.",1373241600,,365,4.083333333333333
2909059,5,B000TR7ZKC,Brian funniest show ever - although I like them all. I really like the fact that he has a vocabulary and does not have to feel like he has to resort to cursing because he doesn't know a word to use. Love how he gets into his jokes with his visuals. Thank you Brian!,1372032000,,265,3.925925925925926
2909060,4,B000TR7ZKC,"Why I paid $30+ for this when his other DVD's are about $8 and just as long, just as funny.  I'm a die hard Regan fan, so had to have it.  But, would highly recomment Standing Up and The Epitome of Hyperbole before buying this.",1369094400,,227,4.022222222222222

2909064,5,B000TR7ZKC,This guy is a comic genious.  I laughed so hard I cried.  His comedy is very clean and self depricating.  No one should feel uncomfortable watching and enjoying the show.,1366243200,,170,4.6
2909065,5,B000TR7ZKC,I'm always on the lookout for great comedians that don't have to resort to filthy language or topics to make me laugh.  Brian Regan is one of those comedians.  His material and expressions are originally hilarious.  I rate him up there with Jim Gaffigan and Jerry Seinfeld.,1365033600,,273,4.76595744680851
2909066,5,B000TR7ZKC,"If you only watch one Brian Regan performance in your life, this is the one you have to see.  My family and me watched it over a whole weekend over and over, and each time we laughed so hard, our stomachs hurt...great ab workout!  Brian is my favorite comedian and he is clean and family friendly.  I relate so much to his sense of humor.  Bravo!",1363132800,,346,4.196969696969697
2909067,5,B000TR7ZKC,"I saw this video about 7 years ago and laughed til I cried.  When I found here, I couldn't resist seeing it again.  And again, laughed til I cried.  Brian Regan is hysterical without being profane or dirty.  My whole family can watch it and every one gets his humor.  I love him!",1361750400,,279,4.188679245283019
2909068,5,B000TR7ZKC,Brian Regan is the best of the best. He doesn't need crude humor to get you to bust out laughing. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.,1357430400,,131,4.5
2909069,5,B000TR7ZKC,Brian Regan is hilarious! It's tough to find a comedian who is as clean and funny as he is. We really enjoyed this comedy act.,1350604800,,126,4.08
2909070,5,B000TR7ZKC,"I don't usually write reviews, most likely due to laziness. However, this one I have to rate.  I can't thank Brian Regan and the producer enough for the production of this dvd.  Let me tell you why.  Because of our awesome Labor Day weekend that I had the other day. This dvd was truly the highlight of the entire day. Everyone was starting to get tired and then I popped this dvd into the player. My daughter said, ""Oh brother mom this better be funny and not corny""  We all laughed so hard. Everyone complimented Brian Regan for making such a clean but extremely laugh out loud funny dvd. I usually do not watch comedian blindly much purchase.  I took a chance and I am so thrilled I did.  I can now play this when my in laws come to visit and not feel nervous.  I hate profanity, it's just unnessary. This DVD 2 thumbs up!  If you're like me believing that laughter is good for the soul and you want to laugh ALOT (never a dull moment), get this dvd.  There are a few hell words and 1 d (amn) word.  If you can't handle even those words, then don't purchase.  However, let me say, this is clean compared to 95% other comedians.  If Brian Regan keeps producing these kinds of dvds, I will be his biggest fan forever.  He is truly amazingly funny.  Thank you so much!",1346716800,4,1268,4.2510460251046025
2909071,5,B000TR7ZKC,"This is Brian at the top of his game.  ""I walked on the Moon"" is incredibly funny with absolutely no lulls or silence... It's nonstop gut busting laughter.  It is my opinion that Brian is the funniest man currently in stand up.  He is so incredibly polised in his craft and he manages to do all of his material in a clean, curse free manner.  I don't mind cursing if the comedian is funny, but usually comics use it as a crutch.  Brian needs none of that.  He's simply hysterical.",1340323200,2,480,4.277777777777778
2909072,5,B000TR7ZKC,"It is so hard to watch comedians any more after seeing this DVD.  Every single bit on here is hysterical.  This is Brian Regan's ""perfect album.""  You will never mail UPS, switch your phone service over, go flying, or many other things without laughing inside.",1327968000,,260,4.733333333333333
2909073,4,B000TR7ZKC,"I already had ""Standing Up"" and ""Epitome of Hyperbole"" before I got this earlier one, and ""I Walked on the Moon"" is definitely on par with those.  Very funny, clean, and well-produced.  However, if you already have ""Standing Up"", you will find out that a lot of the same routines/bits are found on this one as well.  (I guess, technically, that would be a hit on ""Standing Up"" since that one came later, but I saw them in reverse order.)  So, if you already have ""Standing Up"" and think it is only okay, you may want to skip this one.  However, if you consider Brian Regan to be one of the best comedians ever (like I do) and are willing to have some repeats to get the other gems (like I did), get this DVD!",1327363200,10,708,4.214814814814815

2909075,5,B000TR7ZKC,Brian Regan is the funniest commedian I know of. I Walked on the Moon is as good as anything he does. Clean comedy is a must for me which is why Brian Regan is the best. He puts on clean shows that I could take my mom to.,1324339200,,221,3.625
2909076,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Brian Regan is one of the best stand up comics working today, and has been for the past 15 years or so. He is extremely funny, a master with timing, gesture and word choice. As if that weren't enough, his act can be enjoyed by everyone in the family, because he doesn't resort to cursing/vulgarity/adult humor/etc ... and he riffs on everyday situations we all encounter, finding the absurd/funny elements in them with his sharp wit. I recommend this and his other DVDs, as well his live shows. Go see him if he ever performs in your town.",1321660800,3,539,4.510204081632653
2909077,5,B000TR7ZKC,"The last time I laughed this hard was sitting in the first
row at a George Carlin show. Except Regan doesnt need
the f-bombs. He talks about things we are all thinking
but don't always question. Turned several friends on to
him..and they are now die hard fans. My friend called
day after we watched ""I walked on the moon"". Said she
couldnt figure out why her stomach felt like she had done
sit-ups! Laughing that hard has to be good for you!",1321315200,2,441,4.325301204819277
2909078,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Brian Regan is a family favorite.  This video has many, many of his classics, those first seen on his earliest Comedy Central Presents. We quote and text lines from his act, almost as often as we do with passages from the Bible.

Brian's is timeless humor, much like Bill Cosby's ""Himself.""

The DVD playback quality is excellent. No problems.

His combination of physical expression and intelligent comedy are a masterful blend that will be sure to have you laughing throughout the entire video.  After reading other reviews and watching his other offerings as well, I have to agree that if you get only one of his DVDs, definitely get this one!!!

2909083,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Brian Regan is amazing in many aspects of his performance. Not only is he a master with words and their timely delivery, but he also knows how to use his facial expressions to bring his act to an even higher level of hilarity. Best of all, his act is clean and expletive-free, making this video one I can play in front of children and pastors alike. I now own all three of Brian Regan's videos and look forward to future productions. I had the privlege of seeing him live in San Diego a few months ago; again, what an experience, to see a civic center packed with people of all ages listening to a very talented performer who can hit the truth hard and leave you holding your sides while leaving your ears unscathed by foul language or dirty jokes. ""I Walked On the Moon"" is my favorite thus far, and I highly recommend it. It's a perfect decompressant at the end of a stressful day, and you will sleep with a smile on your face.",1303862400,2,929,4.284090909090909

I also appreciate that he doesn't get vulgar or sexual.  That's not necessary for good comedy.  I can share this video with friends or family without concern about the content.

My entire family all are major fans of Mr. Regan and his brand of comedy that does not require any profanity in order to be funny. This is an earlier performance and is absolutely hilarious. If you really want to get the full effect you have to go see Brian in a live performance. I laughed so hard I was sweating and gasping for air! Does that sound like fun, or what? Seriously, Brain Regan is funny, funny, funny.",1234656000,3,466,4.367816091954023

2909101,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Brian Regan is a fantastic stand-up comedian, his jokes are clean but still hilarious so it'll have everyone from a 5yr old to a disgruntled teen and even gramma laughing. His goofy take on everyday activities will have you in stitches. This is definately one of my fave dvd's, enough so that some of my friends have tried to steal it for their own collections. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1225584000,6,383,4.731343283582089

8210433,5,B000TR7ZKC,Brian Regan is the type of comedian that just makes you feel good after you watch him. No dirty jokes. No put downs. Not even any sexual innuendo. How is it possible that he can make you laugh without using any of the low comedy techniques that virtually every other comedian has to stoop down to? It takes a unique talent that has a special outlook on life.,1491004800,4,358,4.279411764705882

8210438,5,B000TR7ZKC,"Brian Regan is a keen observer of human behavior and delivers his observations with an insightful, ironic wit. Richard Burton once said the only woman who has ever intimidated him was Elaine May. Like Elaine May, Brian Regan is someone who can spot phoniness and narcissism in a New York second. He's has the whole package--charm, acute observational skills, a first rate comedy mind, stage presence, verbal chops and good taste, A great bonus is that he works clean. He's coming to Denver in a couple of weeks and we plan to catch his show. This DVD is not new. I saw him a few months ago as a guest on one of Seinfeld's ""Comedians in Cars Having Coffee"" podcasts and he's probably a decade older than he is on this DVD.",1440547200,,721,4.46969696969697
