8622158,5,B00GCEEBHQ,Very Pleasant transaction....these drills will improve your balance and consequently your tango/lead.,1463443200,,101,7.5
8622159,5,B00GCEEBHQ,"Really good basic exercises in my opinion.  May not be apparent if you're first starting Argentine tango, but from what little I've done this is what's missing in a lot of classes.  One of the better tango instructors (now retired) in Seattle used to start off his classes regardless of your level with basic exercises in balance and foot work.  Though not the same, these too are to help you have more fluidity in dance.",1445644800,,421,4.586666666666667
8622160,5,B00GCEEBHQ,"Anyone who has started down the road of the Argentine Tango will know, that it is a dance, that can take a lifetime to master. No matter how good your level is, you can always find something you want to improve on. Yet another fancy move you'd like to incorporate into your dancing repertoire. Not necessarily to use them often, but just to have the confidence in knowing them and knowing how to perform them well - And every once in a while, there's a true delight in performing a flawless 360-degree-plus colgada or a Pulpo-style sacada-gancho-enganche-combo - when the moment is right and the music calls for it, (and when you know your dance partner is up for it!)

Eventually, however, you'll get to a point in your dance, where it is your own balance, and your own body control, that imposes the limits on how much further you can improve physically.

And then you'll start looking into how you can work on these two restrictions. And that is where this DVD comes in - ""tango""-exercises, that you can do on your own. Physical exercises that are aimed at improving your balance and body control, and specifically aimed at the skills used in tango - hopefully allowing you to take your tango proficiency to a higher level.

If you can recognize yourself in what I wrote above, then this DVD should definitely be of interest to you. However, if you cannot recognize yourself in what I wrote, this is definitely not for you.",1403308800,,1426,4.606299212598425
8622161,5,B00GCEEBHQ,"The concept of Argentine Tango exercises done in gorgeous artistic surroundings sounded intriguing enough to make me want this DVD. Turned out that my instincts were correct and the DVD is even better than I imagined. Argentine Tango does not come easily to me but this inspiring and creative DVD makes me want to work harder in my journey of learning the dance. The locations such as the Chateau de Versailles and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are so much nicer than a dull studio with a bland background. The exercises presented range from beginner to more advanced and cover the topics that improve the tango dancer: balance, speed, posture, elegance, and technical fluency.

Do these exercises and you will become a significantly better Argentine Tango dancer. There are months of challenging material on the DVD to help you become better and lessons that you can practice for years to keep you at the peak of your dancing abilities. I suspect that the wonderful ladies that I dance with will soon be commenting on the improvements that they will enjoy in my dancing. It's all about making them happy.",1393891200,,1106,4.851851851851852
8622162,2,B00GCEEBHQ,Anton Gazenbeek is a superb tanguero but the dvd did not suit me. It consisted of exercises for advanced dancers but beyond the needs and competence of  struggling amateurs like myself. So has its place but not much help to us lesser mortals.,1391990400,,242,4.627906976744186
8622163,5,B00GCEEBHQ,"This is smart. The exercises, there so many, are for building your tango skills when you don't have a partner. This DVD has made my balance better; I am faster in my execution of boleos, gauchos, and ochos; and I am getting compliments at milongas about how my dancing looks better. The exercises are beginner to advanced. There is something for everybody. Each exercise is shot in a different location (all magnificent and inspiring). There is this long sequence shot in front of a marble water fountain, I love working at this exercise, I haven't mastered it yet, but it is beyond amazing and memorable. Everything on this DVD is memorable.",1390953600,,642,4.792792792792793
8622164,5,B00GCEEBHQ,Wow!  I'm still learning from Anton's other videos so I knew I would like this one.  It is just what I was looking for and more.  A lot of the moves I was trying to learn from YouTube videos are explained and made clear in my mind.  These moves are also great to practice when you don't have a partner at hand.  I've been told I need to work on my speed but never offered help in how to do that.  This DVD does.  I like movies that are filmed in different exotic locales.  What a great idea to do the same for a tango DVD!,1387670400,,522,3.858490566037736
