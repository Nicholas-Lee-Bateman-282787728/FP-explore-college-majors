8049210,5,B0007NC9Y0,"I love this movie - it's madcap humor, a bit like turning the Marx Brothers loose on the shores of the Danube. But although we have ""Underground"" (which is also a wonderful film) and a couple of others in Region 1 encoding, so far, no ""Black Cat, White Cat""! Would some studio/distributor PLEASE give us a Region 1 release of this?? It deserves a wider audience in the U.S. and Canada.",1122940800,2,385,4.436619718309859
