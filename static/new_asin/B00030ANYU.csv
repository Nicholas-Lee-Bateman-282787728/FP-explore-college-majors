2155408,5,B00030ANYU,"I caught a glimpse of Bob Hope's 1967 TV show on a set in the transient terminal at Cam Rahn Bay. I thought that I was in one of the audience close up shots and I've wondered since then if indeed it was me. A small mystery to carry through life. So, I bought this DVD and--question answered last night--it wasn't me.

  But it was a treat to see the 1967 show and especially Raquel Welch again. She was gorgeous (and still is).

  A lot of the humor was corny, and seems even more so now. But I remember sitting down by myself after catching the show in person at the air base in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, and just feeling good. That feeling didn't return watching the show again, but the memory of it did and with it a feeling of gratitude to Hope and everyone who traveled with him.

  There are shows in this set from Korea, Germany and other places far from southeast Asia. But none of the people in any of the audiences shows signs of regarding themselves  as pitiful victims, which might surprise people who only know about the war or service to country from the media and what they are told in school. Particularly noteworthy is what is revealed by the audience wideshots in Vietnam: the number of young black Americans in Vietnam was not disproportionate, including in combat outfits like the First Infantry Division.",1099958400,42,1324,4.479166666666667
2155409,4,B00030ANYU,"Along with his usual studio Christmas specials, the thing I remember most about Bob as a kid was his shows entertaining the troops in Viet Nam in the 1960's.

Filled with his usual brand of self-depricating humor and the usual 1960's starlets, Bob brought holiday joy to all those young men.

This will be a 3-DVD set.  It includes 9 full shows he did annually for the troops in Vietnam. This, along with the holiday material, have been the most requested material from the Hope/NBC archives.

Makes you feel like a kid again!",1098230400,11,526,4.623655913978495
2155410,4,B00030ANYU,"Brought back memories of when I was growing up. I was disappointed because it was a synopsis of various stops along the way. None of them had a complete show.

2155416,5,B00030ANYU,"I went to Vietnam in 1965 ,saw the show in ChuLai, and when it was broadcasted in the states, my family saw me for the first time since I had left.  I looked for years for a film of this show, and when the DVD came out, purchased it, and saw what they saw for the first time.  It's a wonderful collection from Bob's collection, and if you were there and attended one, it will bring back memories.  In the ChuLai show, several people pictured in the audience never made it home.  During the performance, they stop for a moment, then continue on.  Too many people were sitting on top of an outhouse (6 hole) and it collapsed.  This is a wonderful collection for those who remember..........",1393027200,2,688,4.377952755905512

I remember the guys in my unit asking if they could go see the show, but were not able to because our officers said they could not be spared.

2155429,4,B00030ANYU,"Show business legend Bob Hope (1903-2003) began performing for members of the armed services in 1948, and continued to do so for over forty years.  Hope's appreciation and love for America's armed service personnel, was amazing.  Although a labor of love, entertaining the troops involved not only personal sacrifice, but many times called for putting his life at risk in an active war zone, or other dangerous situation.

Bob Hope: The Viet Nam Years 1964-72, is a collection of nine of Hope's Christmas specials.  These specials feature excerpts from Hope's performances during the holiday season, at military bases predominantly in the south Pacific, and southeast Asia, and even on various US Navy aircraft carriers.  Hope's troupe would typically include bandleader Les Brown and the Band of Renown, the current Miss World, various novelty acts, and a collection of mostly female entertainers.

At the time they were originally aired, these specials were not intended as strictly entertainment, as Hope also wanted to pay tribute to America's military personnel, as well as give those safe and sound in America, a brief view of what those overseas in the military were actually going through.  In his own wonderful way, Bob Hope was doing his best to bring an end to the fighting.

Narrated by Hope, the specials have a pseudo-documentary travel log style, as they follow the tour's itinerary from place to place.  They feature a good dose of Hope's topical humor, as well as clips of a few of the supporting acts.  Also included are interesting and unusual events, like recognizing soldiers for their heroism, meeting dignitaries, experiencing enemy gunfire during a show, landing on a carrier, performing in rainstorms, flying to shows with fighter escort, and most importantly, visiting the sick and wounded in various medical facilities.

These specials provide just a taste, of what the over two hour long performances were like.  The audiences were often massive, and conditions were usually far from ideal, as Hope, who traditionally opened each performance with a golf club in his hands, and dressed in some wacky military outfit, attempted to provide a little laughter.

During the Viet Nam conflict, when some were not willing to openly support America's presence in Viet Nam, Bob Hope and those who joined him on his many USO sponsored tours, bravely lent their full support to the troops, giving their time, enduring hardships, and occasionally putting their lives at risk.  Among those featured in these nine specials are Kaye Stevens, Anita Bryant, Joey Heatherton, Phyllis Diller, Raquel Welch, Ann-Margret, Vida Blue, Lola Falana, Connie Stevens, Neil Armstrong, Jill St. John, Redd Fox, and Jerry Colonna.

Each of the three DVD's in the set contains three specials.  Shot under less than ideal conditions, the image quality often isn't the greatest.  Viewing these nine programs in chronological order, it's striking and sadly poignant, how similar they are, as the years pass, while the futility of war remains.  The supporting cast changes, but the iconic Hope remains a constant benevolent presence.  Seeing the troupe repeatedly visiting the same places year after year, and hearing the same jokes about things like the failure of the Paris peace talks, the draft, and the traffic on the Ho Chi Minh trail, even those who never lived through these times, may begin to get some impression of how terribly long the war has dragged on.  Only in the final years, is there happily some evidence of US troops finally being withdrawn stateside.

This compilation may rate five stars for content, however it will not be relevant to everyone.  While anyone can probably appreciate the song, dance, and novelty acts, those without some knowledge of these particular times, will not understand most of the topical and political references, and some of the humor will be lost.  While those familiar with this turbulent period in time may be best prepared to appreciate the Bob Hope Christmas specials, most  of the laughter is tempered by the realities of war.  I you do like these specials, you might also take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Hope-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B000UFIYQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Hope Ultimate Collection</a>, although there is some repeat content from this set.

Bob Hope was a true friend to almost every American serviceman, and one hell of a good guy.  Memories fade with time, but this set provides a nice reminder of the kinds wonderful things that Hope and his troupe did for so long.  As America continues to maintain a strong military presence around the world, it serves to put Hope's efforts in perspective, as there would seem to be no one today who comes anywhere close to displaying a similar level of support for the military.  Thanks Bob, for so many memories.",1340323200,3,4882,5.215108834827145
2155430,5,B00030ANYU,"This series covers all 9 Bob Hope USO shows he did in SEA. Although a few of the jokes were carried over each year, these shows remain fresh after many years. A must have for the Hope fan in everyone!",1327881600,,200,4.025
2155431,5,B00030ANYU,"I have always enjoyed Bob Hope, and since my husband is a Viet Nam Vet I purchased this item as a gift. What was so special, my husband actually viewed himself in one of the shows and it was a great walk down memory lane; and as the saying goes - It Was Priceless!!",1321315200,,265,3.925925925925926
2155432,2,B00030ANYU,"Ordered this DVD because I was on the USS John F Kennedy when he was aboard. I was kind of disappointed as they only did a very quick out take on all of his stops that year and only 3 or 4 of the skits were even shown and only one performance of one of the people with him.. We all loved and appreciated Bob and the people with him. This DVD will only give one a very brief look at his performances. Apparently this is a copy of his tour that was edited for release to the TV audience and trying to get 8-10 stops in to an hour was just too much to be really good. Just wish someone would put together complete shows for each of the places he visited. To Bob, Thanks for the memories.",1303776000,,684,3.9280575539568345

2155435,5,B00030ANYU,This is a great collector's item for Vietnam Veterans and their families.  These are the complete Christmas shows (minus the commercials).  If you were privileged to attend one of these Bob Hope U.S.O. shows they will bring back a flood of memories. I actually found myself in the 1971 show!

2155436,5,B00030ANYU,"I watched these dvds of Bob Hope's Christmas Vietnam years, and they did a lot to cheer the troops who were so far from home, and who would give anything to spend Christmas with there loved ones.

But now that Bob Hope is GONE, who has taken his place to entertain the troops during the CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY SEASON? I think its time for entertainers who say, we support the troops and put their money where their mouths are. Spend a Christmas with the troops it would probably be the best Christmas EVER.",1258848000,6,501,4.445652173913044

I can't believe it was cut! I also got tired of Bob Hope's championing of the war.",1256256000,3,240,4.127659574468085
2155438,5,B00030ANYU,"As a Vietnam Veteran; I happily recommend this DVD collection to anyone who was there, or has an interest in either Vietnam or Bob Hope.  Bob Hope was one of those rare individuals who was able to entertain without being too ""edgy"", too offensive, or too political.",1251504000,16,265,4.638297872340425
2155439,5,B00030ANYU,"Bob Hope's Christmas show was an American tradition from the 40s to the 70s.  Thousands of people far from home enjoyed these shows in a variety of conditions.  They are a visual history of entertainment and the way we were that is not often available.  Each year, NBC edited the footage into an hour-long TV special.  This DVD set is the nine shows from Viet Nam 1964 to 1972.
Bob Hope was a great comedian and his jokes while they might be dated are never stale.  He pokes fun at the brass, the war and the men sitting or standing everywhere.  Jill St. John, Joey Heatherton, Raquel Welch, Ann-Margret, Connie Steven, Lola Falana and Miss World provide both eye-candy, songs and a foil for Bob's jokes.  This is a variety show aimed at young men with nothing they could not talk about during Sunday dinner.  Even today, the shows are entertaining and enjoyable without considering the history involved.
A montage of ""Silent Night"" ends every broadcast.  This always reminded us of the reason for these shows providing faces to the names in the newspaper.  My show was 1967 at CamRahn Bay; it is an enjoyable now as it was 42 years ago.  This is a DVD for veterans or anyone who enjoys the humor and songs of the era.",1249257600,10,1218,4.5159817351598175
2155440,4,B00030ANYU,"Even though Bob Hope is not part of my generation, I laughed all the way through. As a patriot, I also wanted to own a video from a great comedian who, along with other celebrities, supported our troops during an unpopular war in Vietnam. Totally opposite of today's stars who have denigrated our troops in Irak and America with it.",1232496000,3,332,4.55
2155441,4,B00030ANYU,"These shows are great!  Bob was a wonderful entertainer.  I saw the show at Clark AFB.  I hope that someone will gather the other shows from 1948 on and put those out.

I cannot understand why someone would rate these 1 star just because there is a problem with a disc.  You should be reviewing the show, not a production problem.  A product problem gets resolved by getting a replacement, this does not affect the content which is what people want to read about.

SOMETHING IS MISSING - I do note that even though the shows should be 90 minutes, they are actually closer to 70.  The musical numbers from the guest stars have been removed among other things.  I presume they could not get clearance for the performances.  Too bad.  It would have been nice to get the complete shows.",1220227200,21,782,4.475177304964539

2155443,4,B00030ANYU,"I wasn't born until 1966, but I remember watching lots of Bob Hope specials over the years. This set covering his Vietnam era travels is great. True, some of the humor is dated, but it is great to watch as a time capsule. Especially great (in both a sad and happy way) is being able to see the troops and how they were able to forget the war for a little while. It was great of Bob Hope to give of his life to serve the troops.",1196467200,9,427,3.9195402298850577

There's a juggling act in the show that, if done today, would leave people wondering if it was CGI or some sort of editing trick, but it was all talent and heart.  The guy was simply amazing, we could use a bit of that showmanship nowadays.

Bob Hope, as always, was charming, funny, and a complete vaudevillian.  I just wish we got to see more of him and Redd Foxx.  Those two have incredible chemistry together, it's like they've been doing those kinds of bits for years-absolute professionals.  I just can't seem to get enough of Bob, as I have his Comedy Collections on order!",1164931200,,789,4.52112676056338
2155447,5,B00030ANYU,"It was like watching a home movie as I had been at four of the performances and could relate wholly to them.  The coverage of the shows that I was at was some of the shorter coverages, Long Binh, Dian, and Lai Khe.  I have yet to make time to see the one at Clark Air Force Base.

I have only watched two dvds because they were such a disillusionment.  Once again, these dvd's are only highlights of each show.  Whoever edited and produced these, did so at their own personal taste and view.  It's a shame they couldn't have produced dvds of each year containing complete shows; obviously they had the rights to the shows.  A big disappointment.
As mentioned I purchased years ago when first was offered so didn't spend that much money ( I believe $29.99)  I wouldn't waste the $100, which is currently the sale price.",1460678400,,689,4.691666666666666

Bob Hope didn't forget them like their own country did when for years they were not acknowledged as heros because they couldn't win the war in Vietnam which was dreadful for these soldiers who put their lives on the line and thousands never made it home alive.",1425859200,,692,4.3307692307692305
