8358584,1,B0029YF2FS,"I could not think of one thing redeeming about this film; it is just a bad movie and to me a complete waste of the money i spent to purchase it. Having seen the other Ryuhei Kitamura films, it led me to believe that this was just a payday to him and nothing else, Sort of like when John Woo did ""Paycheck"". A facade and a caricature of the style with no substance.",1315353600,,364,4.0
8358585,5,B0029YF2FS,"This film has very zany characters and a zany plot. The film tends to come out of left field with some of the scenes and its characters. Nothing is sacred in this film. Everything from chopped anatomy to questionable ""guns"" is ever present. From the director of ""versus"" and ""azumi"" I was definitely not expecting any less from him. Definitely not for the squeamish or people expecting any actual plot progression. Recommend for fans oof anime.",1288137600,,444,4.855263157894737
8358586,4,B0029YF2FS,"""Love Death"" is the last film that cult film director Ryuhei Kitamura made in Japan before heading to the USA to make the criminally underrated horror flick Midnight Meat Train. Well, nobody can say he held back with this one, that's for sure. Kitamura pulled all of his influences out, laid them on the table, and then crafted a bizarre 2 1/2+ hour homage/mockery that will exhaust all but the most insane film fans. Take a little (and by ""a little"", I mean ""a lot"") of the Tarantino/Rodriguez influence that he's known for, dip it in Hot Fuzz, toss in every modern yakuza film ever made, and then drop the resulting love child squarely on it's head at a very young age and you've got Love Death in a nutshell. This film is so wild and zany and utterly nonsensical in it's approach that it can only be viewed as a pure spoof of the genres it is paying homage to. And it does that extremely well. The film is laugh-out-loud funny on several levels, and has plenty of references to other films to be caught as well as a whole lot of blood to be spilt. But good god, is it long and self-indulgent.

 The Mickey and Mallory of this little slice of crazy are Sai and Sheila. Sheila (played by sultry pop singer Nora, who was also in Midnight Meat Train) is the girlfriend of a yakuza boss. Sai is your typical stoic, too cool for the room anti-hero. A year ago, they had a 3 day whirlwind romance that ended with a bodycount and a typical shot of the couple walking side-by-side as a car explodes in the background. Then she just up and left. Now she's back in his life with a hilariously exact amount of stolen mob money, a police officer with a chunk of his skull missing in her closet, an analogy about deep sea wildlife, and fishnets. Are you game? Sai is. After shooting off the mob boss's dick, he makes his escape with Sheila onto the open road. Sent after them is the most flamboyant/incompetent hit squad you've ever seen. The film's best recurring gag involves the assassins being too ADD to actually attempt to find or identify their targets. They only remember they are looking for a man and a woman, so every time they see a couple they shoot them dead and then pull out the picture they were given for identification and scratch their heads for a while at how different the picture is from the people they just shot. These bits cracked me up. In another subplot, the cliche cop archetypes are juxtaposed with one being the typical corrupt officer who literally does whatever he feels like fearing no retribution and his partner representing the awkward and hapless loser cops that seem to occupy the films where these yakuza gangs have free reign and only our lone hero can stop them. There's also a bowling subplot. No joke. I told you Kitamura didn't hold back on this one.  It seems like every doofy thought he had in his head wound up in the film. Then again, it was based on a comic so perhaps he was just following the source material.

 First, the good. Love Death was Kitamura's most polished effort prior to his move to The States. It brings to mind films like Smokin' Aces and True Romance along with the others mentioned before. Kitamura differs from most Asian filmmakers in that his primary influences are American which give his films a wonderfully unique East-meets-West identity. The dialogue is often very funny and I have to say that the cast was wonderful. Nora in particular is just an utterly captivating onscreen presence. A man really wold do anything in the world for her character even knowing she was insincere in her intentions. Even some of the bit parts really stood out and delivered on this one. The ladies of Love Death are to die for and there is a lot more sexual content than in the director's previous works. Not actual onscreen sex or nudity, mind you, but there's a ton of sexual humor and some definite steaminess in some scenes. Naturally, the action is very stylized and violent with a lot of bulletholes in various body parts. The smoke coming out of the wounds was a nice touch. Not much CG either, which is good. And as I said, the film's sense of humor in it's parody is pretty dead on. At one point, the heroes stage a classic ambush to counter the inevitable yakuza double-cross and as the backup bursts out of their hidey-holes the movie flashes back to the very unglamorous preparation for the big climactic moment before resuming the action. That is damn funny. The music is exactly what you'd expect from a straight-faced spoof of action movies. No complaints there.

 Not so good: the length.  This movie is exhausting. Even though it was consistently entertaining, I still felt like it should have ended an hour earlier than it did. This thing had endings like Return of the King and none of them were anything to write home about. It was a fun journey, but in the end it had no real destination and just drug on and on. For a film with an epic length, it's scope was closer to an episode of a television show. Watching Love Death feels like watching a whole box set of a yakuza/cop show in one sitting. I really felt like a lot more could have been done with the running time. Now none of this makes the movie something to pass up, but it did dull my enjoyment of it quite a bit. This style of film just works better at a shorter running time. A lot of viewers expecting Versus 2 will definitely be offput by the zany tone and more serious film fans will be annoyed with the self-indulgence. This is a movie that ends with a full-length rock karaoke party playing over the end credits for godsake. The entire presentation is just ludicrous.

 Alright, so fans of yakuza films looking for an Asian version of Hot Fuzz will love Love Death to death. Of this I am sure. Violence fans should find plenty to like and ogling Nora never gets old either. The laughs are numerous and I think most Asian action film fans will have a good time with this one.  Casual moviegoers maybe not so much.
