8050783,5,B0007R5L5U,I absolutely LOVE Jon B. even after all these years. I've seen him in concert so many times and always left the shows smiling from ear to ear. I didn't even know Jon B. did a DVD so I had to get it. I really liked it! It could have offered more into his personal life maybe like who he's dating! But overall I'm glad I got it. Hope he comes out with more products like this for his fans too!,1328486400,,391,3.8395061728395063
8050784,2,B0007R5L5U,"I was expecting more music and insight in to Jon B, but it fell short.  This DVD is badly produced and didn't do Jon justice.  Jon B is one of the most underrated musicians around, but this DVD won't help elevate him.",1207958400,2,217,4.142857142857143
8050785,4,B0007R5L5U,Was not able to hear his new music but i am a fan of Jon B's and I am glad to see he is back in the game. His voice is the bomb!,1201478400,,128,2.909090909090909
8050786,1,B0007R5L5U,"As a diehard Jon B fan, I was skeptical about purchasing this dvd. After reading mixed reviews on cdnow, I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. I was so dissapointed. First of all the dvd says that it gives you details on his life that he never disscussed. Well, I didn't hear anything new, all the things he talked about you can easily read on the internet. Also the interviewer was horrible, she didn't ask many good questions at all. She also annoyed the heck out of me nodding her head in agreement. The dvd also said that he gives a tour of his home. All I saw was the pool area, and the kitchen, and what looked like a living room of some sort. Anyway, the only thing I enjoyed was him singing ""They Don't Know"" accapella. This really saddens me, because I think that Jon B is a really talented aritst and it is a shame that this dvd didn't turn out better than it did. For any real Jon B fans out there looking at buying this dvd, thinking that you will get a bang for your buck, you can forget it. I don't reccommend this at ALL!",1168473600,4,1040,4.102941176470588
8050787,1,B0007R5L5U,"This entire dvd is unprofessionally put together. I gave it one star because such a talented artist as Jon B took art in it.  The truth is that it isn't JB's fault that this DVD is so horrable.  I blame the production company! The audio is HORRID!; really low and staticy at times. At one point, when they are all outside, the audio is dissrupted by wind.  The ""interviewer"" should have been more creative in her questioning.

The artist seems to be a bit reserved, but if you'd like to see him on more of a personal level, I would recommend purchasing this dvd...Or better yet ***Please borrow it****please have low production expectations.  I enjoyed hearing ""they don't know"" acapella, so one good thing came of this purchase.",1154908800,,729,4.6640625
8050788,5,B0007R5L5U,"After reading both possitive and negatives reviews of this film, I decided to go ahead and try it. I have to say that it's a pretty good DVD. I like all the information and songs Jon B does. My only complaint is that the sound is kinda low in one part of the DVD, but other then that it's a nice film. I like the way Jon B had ""costume changes"" during his interviews -- he had one interview outside and one inside. Plus, I liked seeing how he lived too. That was pretty cool. To sum up, I have to say that I recommend this film to everyone who likes Jon B.",1127088000,5,556,3.9292035398230087
8050789,1,B0007R5L5U,"I bought this dvd, because I thought it was going to tell me something new about Jon B.  I was sorely disapointed. The only positive thing I can say about the dvd is that it arrived from America quickly and in good condition.  It had Jon B singing snippets of his songs and a small glimpse into his home.

The dvd was like watching a home video then selling it to the public under the guise of a professional production company; going to tell you something new about Jon B's music, life and struggles.  The dvd kept on showing hightlight of what was on the dvd, I can only assume to fill space.  A few seconds of different videos or performances (not with sound) again to fill space. Having an interview with Jon B and not being able to hear a word the interviewer or Jon B are saying.  Showing footage of I presume are Jon B's friends, while the interview is going on or when he's playing music. Videoing a photographer taking pictures of Jon B and getting into the shot of Jon B singing.

The only reason I haven't sent the dvd back is because I got a good exchange rate of the pound to the dollar.

It does make me wonder if Jon B has seen this dvd.  I wouldn't want a product like this contected to my name out in the public.  Jon B fans beware, DON'T BUY!",1126915200,3,1260,4.169421487603306
8050790,5,B0007R5L5U,"This is the best artist DVD around! Jon gives a tour of his home (looks like a mansion), sings songs live while playing on the piano and then gives a lot of interviews on the DVD. Great DVD!",1107993600,6,190,4.026315789473684
