8188146,5,B000J3E3YW,"The True Glory is one of WWII's lost masterpieces.  I had never heard of this film before, but after watching it, I think it's safe to say I'd seen huge pieces of it on TV -- diced and sliced by the History Channel.  Anyway, what you are getting here is the original, uncut, hour and a half version of this Academy Award winning film about combat in Europe.  It's hosted, I guess you can say, by Dwight Eisenhower who introduces it and provides some narration.  Joining him are dozens of people in the voice-over, in their own words, describing things that happened as they fought to bring down Hitler and Germany in 1944-45.  Also on the DVD are two neat films, one about the Airborne assaults prior to D-Day, and one about building artificial harbors in Normandy.  All in all this is a really interesting DVD that puts you back in the ""feeling"" of WWII.  It was made, after all, just after it happened!",1164412800,7,904,4.475609756097561
