Apparently those versions are already out of print. That girl on youtube, (who has no contact info), must have have found it in a second-hand asian shop since she is asian herself.",1452297600,,325,4.344262295081967
8303101,5,B001FYJ3OY,"I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE AND I WANT IT ON DVD SO BADLY, PLEASE SOMEBODY RESTOCK THIS. Along the sane vein, this movie is an incredibly fresh take on the story of Cinderella, with amazingly surrealistic scenery, and a fantastic cast. If you get the chance to watch it, DO SO.",1414281600,2,274,4.392156862745098
8303102,5,B001FYJ3OY,"I caught this on t.v. after the show had already started and it took me years to find the title (hey, it wasn't obvious!).  I would not really have been attracted to it thinking it would be a traditional Cinderella story.  It is wonderfully far from that.  As another reviewer has said in some ways it looks like it is  set in the 30's but it just has so much more going for it.  Two of my favourite scenes involve Maab and the phrase ""positively piscatorial"" to describe the dress she conjures and then the music that the hip, bored prince and his band produce.  Want to see it again!!!!!",1304121600,4,589,4.3090909090909095
8303103,5,B001FYJ3OY,"Kathleen Turner plays the stepmother to perfection!

This, originally televised, version of the Cinderella story is fresh and (somewhat) updated, taking place in a kingdom that's somewhere just outside of anyplace I know, in the perhaps 1930s or 1940s, which I'm guessing based on the vehicles and trains used in some of the scenes. I don't know where exactly it was filmed, but the outside scenes are stunning and the new take on Cinderella's godmother was interesting and somehow, almost believable. If you're a Cinderella fan, and ever get a chance to watch this one, make sure you do so.

This has got to be my favorite version of Cinderella, and I've collected quite a few. I watched it when it aired on television and managed to catch it on tape at the time, but that included commercials, and everyone knows vhs tape and even homemade dvds have a habit of going bad, so I've been waiting ever since for a release of this version for sale. For all that this listing shows it in a case available for sale, I've never seen it available and greatly fear that if someone who maybe did manage to get one put it on the market, the vast 'it's not available anywhere' price would put it well above my ability to buy. So...powers that be, remember the lowly fans that keep you in business, and put this wonderful  version of Cinderella onto a dvd and let us buy it.",1279324800,14,1362,4.528455284552845
