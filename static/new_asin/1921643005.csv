7801209,5,1921643005,"I like to learn about how scientific research is done, and I enjoyed the way Dr. Geoff Downes explains dendrochronology, which he's an expert on.  I didn't realize before watching it that tree rings are influenced by lots of factors.  His main goal in the presentation is helping people see that it's a more complex science than is generally thought, and that it doesn't lead to simple conclusions about how old the earth is or how climate change will affect the world in the future.  There are many factors affecting growth rates, and some ring structures can falsely seem to be annual.  He touches briefly at the end on the global warming debate by explaining that climate change is real, but it's unclear whether carbon dioxide is a cause of global warming or colinear (correlated, happening at the same time, related but not a direct cause).",1404172800,2,845,4.767123287671233
7801210,1,1921643005,"This film was produced by Creation Ministries International.
The film consists of a lecture with slides giving a highly technical picture of tree growth.
As a starter the lecturer makes some seemingly snide remarks about models. He also refers to creationism-- comments I did not understand. But throughout the lecture he shows and refers  to modeling. At the end he says the ultimate key to the past, present and future is the word of God, who happens to be the protagonist and author of it all.

He talks about population control, saying that what is pushed (e.g Paul Ehrlich) is that man is a plague, a disease, and that the world would be better off if man were pushed off the earth. The bible tells us that abortion is a sin, that licentiousness...it is not a sin to have a rv or burn an incandescent light bulb. That  increase in co2 will not cause unpleasant climate shifts... That is where religion overshadows science.

So I don't know where the lecturer is coming from. What is the motivation for this lecture? I am confused.",1322179200,3,1035,4.639344262295082
