8393198,1,B003AU46Q6,"It's REALLY bad.  First of all, this looks like it was filmed at the CES Adult Convention in Las Vegas by an amateur.  There are a couple of lame interviews with people you've never heard of and will never hear of again.  But what really irritates me is that Tori Black (2010 AVN Performer of the Year) is listed in the credits.  The only view we ever see of Tori is from a safe distance in the aisle, and you can hardly tell it's her since she doesn't want to be photographed.  Tori Black is basically hiding behind another young woman in her booth.  Also, Kayden Kross (a remarkably beautiful adult film actress) is also photographed from the aisleway for a few minutes, and there is no interview.  Essentially, Kayden is oblivious to the fact that she is being filmed, and that's probably how the people who slapped this crap together got away with filming her without permission.  The technical aspects of this video document are laughable.  The sound just disappears and the film goes black for about 10 minutes in the middle.  Then, it starts again from the first interview with some stripper you will never see again.  (That's quite alright, IMHO.)  This flick ends after about 40 minutes.  The only interview which is mildly interesting is with Alexis Ford who looks extremely hot.  That's it.  The rest of this DVD is pure junk.  Save your dough, and spend it somewhere else.  The people who made this film should be ashamed of themselves.  I wish I could post negative stars for this product.",1281052800,8,1502,4.625
