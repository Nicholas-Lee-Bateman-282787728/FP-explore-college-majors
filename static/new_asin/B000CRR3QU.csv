8101410,4,B000CRR3QU,"I watched this movie primarily to see Raymond Burr in an early role, and while he only gets ninth billing, he gives by far the most interesting performance.  As was usual for him at this point in his career, he portrays a villain, but plays him against type, i.e., though evil, he's an amiable and charming fellow.  This was ten years before Burr achieved fame as Perry Mason, and it's great to see him so young (about 30) and in a very different role.  Otherwise, this is a typical Hollywood western, nothing much to distinguish it, but entertaining nonetheless.",1295049600,2,563,4.666666666666667
