3428402,5,B001993YCW,"Yes, it was a fabulous show. Great acting, fine cast, etc. And it nearly broke the bank, so any release would dig up old debts. From what I know (I worked on it briefly), it's in permanent limbo. A true loss.",1235779200,14,208,4.097560975609756
3428403,5,B001993YCW,"Please bring this series out on DVD. Golems, mechanical mole machines, rocket-powered vampires, a sinister, secret brotherhood and a steam-powered cyborg, this series had it all. Although the series suffered from a low budget(which show in the SFX),the racing plots and witty dialogue made it easy to suspend disbelief. The great pity (besides not being available on DVD)is that this series only ran a single season.",1233360000,26,416,5.318181818181818
3428404,5,B001993YCW,They are taking way to long to release this item on DVD. Great fun and awesome effects for the times. Definitely draggin their feet on this one. Only complaint on the actual series is young Jules should have been written in with a French accent instead of an American one. Would have made it more believable.,1226880000,5,308,4.517857142857143
3428405,3,B001993YCW,"I think this show was great fun. It had adventure, wit, and great looking guys! It was just a lot of fun and I hope it is put on DVD soon.",1211155200,5,138,3.4838709677419355
8272894,5,B001993YCW,"Read the other 5-star reviews as they are correct but also be aware that there are scenes in TSAOJV that are unique and incredibly powerful.  SPOILER ALERT:  There is a scene where Michael Praed is on the ground holding his dead fiancee in his arms absolutely no movement (except the celebrating around them), no facial expression, no words, no tears he literally radiates grief and anger.  I have never seen a more sexual scene as when Rebecca puts her forehead on his and rubs her cheek on his. There is a look of such love and pure physical pleasure in those few seconds it is orgasmic. The Russian Roulette dynamic and the scene where he orders her to kill him. Actors (and directors) get awards for over emoting but the thought and performances of such (TSAOJV) scenes far out shines anything else I've ever seen.",1347408000,,818,4.627586206896551
8272895,5,B001993YCW,"To ""the powers that be""--PLEASE release ""THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF JULES VERNE"" on DVD!!!  This show is a science fiction CLASSIC and is well-loved by fans worldwide!!!",1335657600,,167,5.185185185185185
8272896,5,B001993YCW,Amazing detail on the ships and gadgetry!  Great show!  Absolutely riveting.  You will not be able to turn the channel.  Please release it soon!,1326672000,,144,4.875
8272897,5,B001993YCW,"This is an outstanding series. It appeals to fans of science fiction, action and horror. Clearly they spent a lot of time on the costumes, sets and props. It's funny and exciting, too. Amazon, please release the series on DVD!",1320105600,2,226,4.675
8272898,5,B001993YCW,"I just re-watched my off-air copies of this series and I absolutely loved it, just like the first time I saw it.  Unlike a lot of Science Fiction, because the series is set in 1861 it doesn't look dated watching it now. And it's great fun, well-produced, with exciting, well-told stories, and some great acting.
In this, Jules Verne is a struggling want to be author, with a few plays to his credit but years before he would become the Father of SF.  (Yes, they are off in their dating, but oh well).
Jules also has visions of the future, visions he records in his stories and drawings -- which brings him to the attention of the sinister League of Darkness, and their horribly deformed leader, Count Gregory (a wonderful Steampunk villian more machine than man).  But Jules also meets a small group of people destined to be his friends:  the gentleman gambler and ex-secret service agent Phileas Fogg, and his cousin Rebecca Fogg (Now a current secret service agent).  In the pilot, Phileas acquires the Aurora, a dirigible airship, and Passepartout the Aurora's pilot and his new valet.
But the characters all have their quirks, that make them fascinating to watch:  Phileas, having just lost his brother, Erasmus on a deadly secret service mission gone wrong, has quit the service and is wracked by guilt and horrible depression (to the point of not caring if he lives or dies) -- meeting Verne changes his life, bringing him out of his melancholy.  Passepartout is not your average valet -- he's an engineer capable of making many of his own inventions as well as creating items Verne sees in his visions.  Rebecca is a 19th century Emma Peel -- secret service agent, complete with gadgets and disguises.  Verne, himself, is portrayed as an enthusiastic, idealistic dreamer, not so confident in his ability to become a real writer.
The plots borrow from the novels of both Jules Verne and HG Wells -- featuring time travel, other dimensions, rocket-power vampires, giant mole machines, ghosts, and golems.  In short, 19th century gothic fantasy and SF fun.
Please bring this series out on professional DVD.  And please use the longer Canadian versions as masters, not the horribly cut-up version (missing 5 or more minutes) from the US SF channel.",1312675200,14,2251,4.8359375
8272899,5,B001993YCW,"I was surfing one morning about 3 am..and by chance caught the show..I was immediatly smitten within 5 minutes..especially of Philias Fogg ie..Michael Praed..as well as the rest of the wonderful cast..it was so inventive, beautifully filmed..the costumes unbelievable...I since then have gone over to england many times to meet and watch Mr. Praed in many shows..from musicals.drama,dark farces ect..I wish this show would come out on dvd..in blue ray too...I do not care the cost..I want this show...as many others..as we only have really bad copies of the show..I would also love to have Nick Glennie Smiths soundtrack to this show..the soundtrack is beautiful, full and rich...the music of Mr. Smith I do have several of his..and all are just the same..thanks..please get this dvd out for the rest of the world to see a truly inventive show..at that time..it was ahead of so many other shows...and it was the first show shot in HD...I even heard that Mr. George Lucus came up to see the filming ect on HD...Geraline K.James",1278720000,7,1026,4.97093023255814
8272900,5,B001993YCW,"While not for everyone, The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne provides action, history, and science fiction.  It is regretful that financial and legal problems block the release of this artistic show.  This is where artistic creation is hindered by the realities of law and economics.  This is a situation where some sort of bankruptcy proceeding would help get the show released to DVD so those of us who want to buy it can  do so and would also allow the creditors to recover something.",1272758400,2,487,4.761904761904762
8272901,5,B001993YCW,"I understand that this was the first show to be filmed entirely in HD, was privately funded and was just fun all around. I have lousy copies that don't do it justice. The acting, scripts, the wonderful stage sets...it's occasionally corny, but always fun and any show that combines steampunk tech with zombies, ghosts, vampires, World Dominating Leagues and aliens, all set in the Victorian era is bound to sparkle. This does. Can't wait for the DVD and am praying they'll sort out whatever problem is keeping it from being released. I will most certainly buy it and many of my friends will too. Just waiting with fingers crossed.",1260057600,12,630,4.7889908256880735
8272902,5,B001993YCW,"This is one of those rare tv programs that is thoughtful and well written.
It is done in the manner of the new Dr. Who series, and could have been
just as popular with the right promotion.  The producers would do
well to release it on DVD !  (then I could get rid of all the VHS tapes
in my library...yes, we all taped ""Jules Verne's Secret Adventures""
every week when it was on TV, anxiously awaiting the next episode !)",1245628800,5,421,4.185185185185185
8272903,5,B001993YCW,"I absolutely loved this show and was sad but not surprised when it was cancelled. I will snatch up the DVD of the series as soon as it appears; which I expect will only be in ""on demand"" release.

The one and only thing I didn't like about the show was that Rebecca Fogg was a proto-feminist (yawn) who just happened to be a martial arts expert and extremely experienced in everything imaginable despite being only about 24. This pandering crap gets so old.

I can believe in steam powered space vehicles before I can believe in Victorian era politically correct stereotypes.

I don't need after-school-special type sensitivity and diversity lessons injected into my escapism.",1244073600,3,676,4.860869565217391
