This collection is for any Rambo fan!

The new movie ""Rambo"" is awesome. Like other reviewers mention, it is very realistic. The movie takes place in Burma, where events depicted in the movie are happening daily.

The collection includes Rambo 1,2, 3 and 4. Plus a digital copy of the new Rambo and a special features disc.

This is the ultimate Rambo collection for your DVD library!",1212105600,31,455,4.87012987012987
3147630,4,B0015XHP4A,"This review will not focus on critiques of the Rambo films, but rather on the details of the various digital home video releases.  Since there have been three Rambo complete collection DVD sets and a blu-ray set so far, the contents of the various releases can be a quandary for fans.  In 2002, Artisan originally released all 3 movies in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-Trilogy-Special-Edition-DVD-Collection/dp/B0000640RX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo Trilogy Special Edition DVD Collection</a>.  This was an incredible set put together as nothing short of a labor of love.  Not only were the movies digitally re-mastered, but the set came with an abundance of special features including commentaries, documentaries, and trailers, most of which were included in a bonus 4th disc.  In 2004, Artisan released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-Trilogy-Ultimate-Edition-DVD-Set/dp/B0004Z33G4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo Trilogy Ultimate Edition DVD Set</a>&nbsp;after the Special Edition DVD set went out of print.  The Ultimate set was primarily a waste of money for many fans, as most of the Special Edition DVD features did not carry over.  Instead, the 'Special Operations' interactive features were offered up as a poor substitute.  The only notable inclusion to this set was found on the 'First Blood' DVD, which featured the alternate ending and a commentary track by Stallone.  This was later released in 2008 as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-Trilogy-Blu-Ray-Box-set/dp/B0015XHP4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo Trilogy Blu-Ray Box set</a>&nbsp;featuring the same bonus content as the Ultimate Edition DVD set but with improved picture and sound.  Also in 2008, Lionsgate released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-The-Complete-Collector-s-DVD-Set/dp/B0015XHP4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: The Complete Collector's DVD Set</a>&nbsp;featuring all 4 movies.  This set carried over most of the bonus features from both of the previous DVD collections, although the advertised 'First Blood' commentary with author David Morrell from the Special Edition was erroneously missing.  The individual movies were identical to the Ultimate Edition set but the bonus disc from the Special Edition set was also included, along with a few featurettes found only on the individual Special Edition movies.  In 2010, Lionsgate released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-The-Complete-Collector-s-Blu-Ray-Set/dp/B003KV3E3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: The Complete Collector's Blu-Ray Set</a>, which reinstated the David Morrell 'First Blood' commentary but had many of the featurettes found on the DVD set's bonus disc inexplicably omitted.  Below are the specs for the Lionsgate 2008 Rambo: The Complete Collector's DVD Set, which is the most comprehensive release to date in terms of bonus features.  Any differences with the 2010 blu-ray collection has been noted in parenthesis:

Theatrical Trailers for all 4 Films

To recap, those who have the 2002 Special Edition DVD set are probably better off buying the individual release of the last Rambo film.  Those who own the 2004 Ultimate Edition DVD set might consider upgrading if the features on the 2008 bonus disc sound appealing.  The 2008 Complete Collector's DVD set is probably best suited for those who don't own either of the previous DVD collections.  And for those wanting the best video and audio experience, the 2010 blu-ray collection is clearly the best choice, even though some of the bonus features from the 2008 DVD release were omitted.  Whatever set one decides to purchase, the constant re-release of the Rambo movies, although frustrating to many, can also be seen as a testament to the enduring legacy of a pop cultural icon that refuses to die.",1209772800,365,6130,6.940182054616385
3147631,5,B0015XHP4A,"Hi All,

I just Pre-Ordered this item and I think it deserves ""5"" shiny stars ... I watched RAMBO in theatres ""4"" times in one day in Dubai-UAE last February ... it is more than great .. and I think it is the best RAMBO yet because it is very simple and close to reality more than 150% .... I like the last 10 minutes in the movie ... and also I like how Stallone end this saga.

Regards,

Ibrahim",1209513600,14,397,3.9375

3147901,5,B0015XHP4A,"Rambo - The Complete Collector's Set consists all four Rambo films - First Blood,Rambo:First Blood Part II,Rambo III and Rambo - that was based on David Morrell's novel's First Blood character,John Rambo,who was a troubled Vietnam War veteran and a former Green Beret who has many military skills particularly in aspects of survival,weaponry,combat and warfare.

First Blood involves the story wherein John Rambo becomes a country drifter for the last 10 years as he had difficulty adjusting to civilian life due to the psychological ill-effects he got during the Vietnam War. Then he got involved law enforcement and authorities in a particular town that led him to become violent. As for Rambo:First Blood Part II,it involves the story wherein Rambo is taken from prison and was asked to rescue American POW's from Vietnam. Meanwhile,we get to see Rambo becomes involved in the Afghan War to save his Colonel Trautman in Rambo III.Finally,Rambo becomes involved in the war in the Burmese territory when he tries to save American missionaries that were held captive.

There are plans for Rambo V. But nevertheless,having the complete collector's set is a good purchase. It consists of a lot of special features that a fan of the series will get to know more about the making of the films and the music used as well as Rambo character. Added to that,we also get to see an excellent picture and sound quality in all films in the series. This contains from the David Morrell's novel First Blood as well as Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo, a troubled Vietnam War veteran and former Green Beret who is skilled in many aspects of survival, weaponry, hand to hand combat and guerrilla warfare. Overall,it was a great collector's set for people who are Rambo fans.",1408838400,,1758,4.95593220338983

3147915,5,B0015XHP4A,Now if ever heard of Sylvester Stallone you think of his hit movies Rocky or Rambo now to me Rambo is the best of the 2 i mean in the first one he's walking along going into town going for a bite to eat and then that's when the cops come in and let me tell you they messed with the wrong guy but they didn't know what he's cappable of well they do now in the movie the first one was the best in book and then there was first blood part 2 and then it was Rambo 3 where he had to rescue the col. and then it was Rambo the new one which was awesome because of all the gore and plus that's the way they should all be so this set is one awesome Rambo set because it has all 4 in it i wish the directors cut would be in it but it isn't so if you love Rambo get them in HD it will blow your mind,1404345600,,788,3.560693641618497

3147931,5,B0015XHP4A,"From a time when movie companies knew how to make a film with lasting appeal and saleability. In the pursuit for bigger opening weekends, modern action films soften off and dumb down for the teen market and 12-15 ratings, but that means these films don't stand up to the test of time. All the certificate 18 blockbusters from the 80-90's still sell on DVD/Blu and are still loved. I can barely name one film from the last decade that can compare to Rambo, The Terminator, Alien(s), Robocop et al. OK, the third Rambo was a dog, but Sly returned with form on the last film, and seems on a one man crusade to reinstate the genre with The Expendables too.

Part II is hands down my favorite mindless action movie. Its a shame that they kill his hot girlfriend but how else is he supposed to muster the energy to carjack the copter and destroy the POW camp? Part 1 is a classic. Lets face it , I'd rather watch Part II twice than watch Part 3 once. The fourth one is a modern classic. Thank you Mr. Stallone.",1388102400,,653,4.030769230769231

This was one of two iconic roles for Sylvester Stallone (along with Rocky). This set does not include the recently released 'Rambo' Extended Cut. The films get 4 stars but this release gets 2 stars. It is even lighter than the bloated Rocky BD collection (though there are six films in that franchise). Ignore the Amazon editorial review which refers to the 6-disc DVD collection; this Blu-ray Collector's Set is 4 discs.

In terms of bonus content, Lionsgate shows the most attention towards 'First Blood' and not all of the supplements for that have even been ported over from DVD. A total of over 2 hours of bonus content for 4 films doesn't cut it. The main problem is that an additional 2 hours of vintage features and documentaries that were available in the Special Edition Trilogy BD set and the Complete Collector's DVD Set released earlier are missing. Deleted scenes from Rambo III are also absent. That could have made this a deluxe release. Fans who already own the BD Trilogy will find nothing new except for the 2008 film and a few more trailers.",1378512000,11,1185,4.72463768115942

You will notice that the disc says DISC 1, but there is no DISC 2.  Is it that hard to create a new label?

The presentation of the DVD's is compact and attractive. When playing the DVD's you have several modes to play them in(one is plenty). You get Rambo First Blood. You get Rambo First Blood II. You get Rambo III. You get Rambo (the 4th Rambo movie). Then you get Rambo the digital copy that you can download to your computer and then to I-tunes ect. And you get a DVD with several short films on several different topics (all are interesting). That is 6 quality DVDs for $23.00. That is a deal.

3148014,4,B0015XHP4A,"The movies speak for themselves. From First Blood to Rambo, we have a iconic and genuine character being put through hell both emotionally and physically. He's a trained killing machine with his own moral code (which in many ways is better than those he's served under). Everyone can sit and debate over Stallone's acting ability, but many really can't discount his writing ability. He tends to have a way with his characters, no matter what movie it is, where the dialog/scenes all work to bring to life a fictional character with both pathos and humanity. So with that being said, I want to speak more on the packaging/features of the film, as everyone who is reading this is probably wondering if this all-in-one is worth it or not. Before I do that I wanted to say that the last Rambo movie, though Rambo is older, is more realistic and just as good as the predecessors. And the documentaries describing how this movie both was true-to-subject matter and a gripping action vehicle is worth watching. Especially when you hear the backstory of Burma and the trials and tribulations that went with getting the film made and getting it seen.

now onto the packaging. It's a regular sized case with all four movies. All look/sound great. They did a great job with the audio/video that's for sure. The extras are on each disc and are definitely worth checking out. I used to own the four dvds that came in a tin and I believe these are the same special features as that set. My only gripe is: (and this is a major pet peeve I have concering complete collections of franchises) The fourth disc says ""disc one"" on the label. I am a collector of movies so I want the best collection I can have, and part of me wanted to go for getting these individually, for one reason it makes my collection seem bigger. I use a cataloguing program to list my dvds, and well it's the difference between one and four. if I buy the complete saga that's just one title etc. However if a good deal comes along where I can get them all together without sacrificing quality then I am all for it. I understand this is easiest for them. But Can't they just press more copies without the ""disc one"" on it? since it is now part of a set and not a standalone. From what I understand this is from a two disc set where the second is just a digital copy. That's fine. I do not lose any special features so I don't feel cheated in that respect. But everytime I look at the discs that extra printing always stands out, and I just know if someone is looking through it they'll wonder where the fifth disc is of the set. I know this is a minor thing to quibble about. But I am picky with my collection. But I wanted to let others know in case this does bother them too.

Also I'd like to point out that First Blood did not work on my pc (which had updated firmware for the drives and the latest cyberlink Powerdvd installed. It worked perfectly on my standalone player though. All the other movies played in my pc without issue. I know part of that is a cyberlink thing and I might just need another patch, but for about three years I have not had to update any of my dvd playing software. So I am not sure what made this one so different. But it plays well in a blu ray player just not a pc drive. I have a big flat panel monitor with logitech thx certified speakers and a thx certified creative sound card, so I like playing it through my pc first and formost. This isn't a major issue either. I just wanted to let everyone know before they bought it. But all of the other played perfectly on my pc without issue. So I'd highly recommend this to everyone basically. It's action with a heart. Yes, it's over the top in some parts, but when Rambo takes out the chopper from hell with a tank, it might seem unbelievable but it's totally cool just the same. Fun to watch and you might learn a few things along the way (like Bill Cosby used to say). The special features are definitely informative not just on the movie but of the political climates of the time. One reason Rambo works is that it's fiction but it's fiction set in real life conflict and in real life facts. So it's great to watch and I'd highly recommend this set as you get four movies at a great price.",1350172800,4,4230,4.332912988650693

My favorite is First Blood (Part 1) because it has the best storyline (if you can have a solid story in this series), but the action is also top-notch.

Rambo (Part 4) is a close second.  Stallone goes out with a bang in the series.  I was hoping Stallone would make a prequel (obviously he would be too old to play Rambo in Vietnam), but still I think a trip to Southeast Asia back in Vietanm could be extremely intense!

I can never grow tired of watching Rambo movies!

Unlike all the other senseless violence on Hollywood screens, Rambo's
actions make a lot of sense and are fuelled by Justice and Compassion.
I see these 2 important themes played out more than the external
actions of his self defense.

Rambo always fights for a Higher and Greater Cause, unlike the usual
mindless solider in any war that seeks only to suck up to his puppet-
masters dressed in shiny buttons.

Anyone who can transcend the useless ""values"" of the modern world
will always have my admiration. Rambo is one of these admirable
on-screen figures.

Anyone who has ever lived like a poor commoner for years outside
comfortable America can see how a hero like Rambo can really change
things for the better!

Anyone who has ever been betrayed by once trusted authority figures
and evil government agencies can relate very well to Rambo!

I highly recommend Rambo movies to anyone who wants Justice done in this
evil world!

Rambo is much worthy of real life emulation!

I read reviews about the original special edition discs of the first 3 Rambo flicks and that set was good. Then the Ultimate Edition set came out. Artisan must have really been on drugs to release that set because that set was a pure waste of money (I never said that I bought any of these sets, just heard about them). I saw the Collector's set at a Wal-Mart and I bought it for less than 30 dollars. Great deal since it does have the Ultimate Edition versions of the first 3 films with the new one in a 2-Disc Special edition with a digital copy. The set rounds out with a bonus 6th disc with most of the extras incorporated from the original special edition set. The only thing about the Ultimate Editions that suck are the interactive options features on all three original films. The stuff that is there is not that informative. The commentary tracks are definitely more informative. The new Rambo got the best treatment of them all with all the extras on one disc with disc 2 being the film's digital copy. It should've been on the movie disc and not on a disc of it's own. Stupid. All-in-all, this set is recommended and it is very cheap too. If you cannot find the original special edition set then this collector's set is the one to have. 6 discs at a price less than 30 dollars makes a great deal. Worth it all the way.",1238544000,,1414,4.339622641509434
3148069,5,B0015XHP4A,"Boxset comes with all 4 Rambo movies! In my opinion 3 of the 4 Rambo movies are really good or excellent, it's just Rambo 3 which lets the franchise down a bit. Still this boxset is definitely worth getting.

Rambo 1 is a classic, Rambo 2 is a great sequel (a lot of people don't like this one but I think it's slightly underrated), Rambo 3 although, not as good as any of the other 3 still worth watching even though you'll probably find yourself watching the other 3 more than you would this one. Rambo 4 is very good as well, a good way to end the franchise (or is it the end?)

This is the only place I found it and just in time for Christmas (I got a pug as a gift and I named him RAMBO!) The movies are great and the presnetation is well done. I know these flix are always on TV, but it's nice to just sit and watch all the way thru without editing and interuptions. ;)",1231286400,2,405,3.776470588235294
3148072,5,B0015XHP4A,"There's nothing more I could add to how great the ""Rambo"" legacy is.  These movies are all very important to what are Hollywood ""must-haves.""

But, what really makes this collection better than all the previous box sets is the sixth disc.  The loaded ""special features"" DVD.  You get to hear from former special forces agents and retired Vietnam vets and what their take was and what missions they've participated in while in Vietnam.  Plus you get a documentary on Ronald Reagan and his take on his admiration of the John Rambo icon.

But, what I really found interesting is what the war in Afghanistan was all about.  How we went in to get the Russians out, but then left the country poor, devastated, and helpless which allowed the Taliban to finance it's future in away that promoted the ""axis of evil"" yet to come.

This was a very interesting ""Veteran's Day"" for me.  These documentaries were a wealth of information of subjects about war that many of us never really understood before, and therefore, never fully understood why Bush keeps this war alive in Iraq.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not backing Bush. He still failed our nation in many ways (the economy, poor war planning, securing his re-election by tampering with the voter ballots in Florida, supporting the profiting oil industry, etc.) but I wish he never started this war the way he did.  (Remember, it all began with Saddam Hussain, which is no longer a concern).

I didn't mean to drift here, but John Rambo represents a very important icon in pop culture.  As a hero, and as a man in great emotional pain.

I'd even welcome a ""Rambo V"" if they ever thought about it.",1226361600,,1638,4.642361111111111

Overall I was very pleased!
The only thing that is weird is that the 5th disc, which got its own panel, is the digital copy of Rambo (2008). I understand why, because we're getting the two disc Rambo (2008), but it just seems odd - overall. If Stallone really does release this Director's cut of Rambo (2008) he's been talking about, then I'll take that disc and put it on panel #5!!!! HAHA! And throw that digital copy dvd away.

3382127,4,B0015XHP4A,"This review will not focus on critiques of the Rambo films, but rather on the details of the various digital home video releases.  Since there have been three Rambo complete collection DVD sets and a blu-ray set so far, the contents of the various releases can be a quandary for fans.  In 2002, Artisan originally released all 3 movies in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-Trilogy-Special-Edition-DVD-Collection/dp/B0000640RX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo Trilogy Special Edition DVD Collection</a>.  This was an incredible set put together as nothing short of a labor of love.  Not only were the movies digitally re-mastered, but the set came with an abundance of special features including commentaries, documentaries, and trailers, most of which were included in a bonus 4th disc.  In 2004, Artisan released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-Trilogy-Ultimate-Edition-DVD-Set/dp/B0004Z33G4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo Trilogy Ultimate Edition DVD Set</a>&nbsp;after the Special Edition DVD set went out of print.  The Ultimate set was primarily a waste of money for many fans, as most of the Special Edition DVD features did not carry over.  Instead, the 'Special Operations' interactive features were offered up as a poor substitute.  The only notable inclusion to this set was found on the 'First Blood' DVD, which featured the alternate ending and a commentary track by Stallone.  This was later released in 2008 as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-Trilogy-Blu-Ray-Box-set/dp/B0015XHP4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo Trilogy Blu-Ray Box set</a>&nbsp;featuring the same bonus content as the Ultimate Edition DVD set but with improved picture and sound.  Also in 2008, Lionsgate released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-The-Complete-Collector-s-DVD-Set/dp/B0015XHP4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: The Complete Collector's DVD Set</a>&nbsp;featuring all 4 movies.  This set carried over most of the bonus features from both of the previous DVD collections, although the advertised 'First Blood' commentary with author David Morrell from the Special Edition was erroneously missing.  The individual movies were identical to the Ultimate Edition set but the bonus disc from the Special Edition set was also included, along with a few featurettes found only on the individual Special Edition movies.  In 2010, Lionsgate released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-The-Complete-Collector-s-Blu-Ray-Set/dp/B003KV3E3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: The Complete Collector's Blu-Ray Set</a>, which reinstated the David Morrell 'First Blood' commentary but had many of the featurettes found on the DVD set's bonus disc inexplicably omitted.  Below are the specs for the Lionsgate 2008 Rambo: The Complete Collector's DVD Set, which is the most comprehensive release to date in terms of bonus features.

To recap, those who have the 2002 Special Edition DVD set are probably better off buying the individual release of the last Rambo film.  Those who own the 2004 Ultimate Edition DVD set might consider upgrading if the features on the 2008 bonus disc sound appealing.  The 2008 Complete Collector's DVD set is probably best suited for those who don't own either of the previous DVD collections.  And for those wanting the best video and audio experience, the 2010 blu-ray collection is clearly the best choice, even though some of the bonus features from the 2008 DVD release were omitted.  Whatever set one decides to purchase, the constant re-release of the Rambo movies, although frustrating to many, can also be seen as a testament to the enduring legacy of a pop cultural icon that refuses to die.",1209772800,365,6130,6.940182054616385

I just Pre-Ordered this item and I think it deserves ""5"" shiny stars ... I watched RAMBO in theatres ""4"" times in one day in Dubai-UAE last February ... it is more than great .. and I think it is the best RAMBO yet because it is very simple and close to reality more than 150% .... I like the last 10 minutes in the movie ... and also I like how Stallone end this saga.

First Blood involves the story wherein John Rambo becomes a country drifter for the last 10 years as he had difficulty adjusting to civilian life due to the psychological ill-effects he got during the Vietnam War. Then he got involved law enforcement and authorities in a particular town that led him to become violent. As for Rambo:First Blood Part II,it involves the story wherein Rambo is taken from prison and was asked to rescue American POW's from Vietnam. Meanwhile,we get to see Rambo becomes involved in the Afghan War to save his Colonel Trautman in Rambo III.Finally,Rambo becomes involved in the war in the Burmese territory when he tries to save American missionaries that were held captive.

In the pursuit for bigger opening weekends, modern action films soften off and dumb down for the teen market and 12-15 ratings, but that means these films don't stand up to the test of time. All the certificate 18 blockbusters from the 80-90's still sell on DVD/Blu and are still loved. I can barely name one film from the last decade that can compare to Rambo, The Terminator, Alien(s), Robocop et al. OK, the third Rambo was a dog, but Sly returned with form on the last film, and seems on a one man crusade to reinstate the genre with The Expendables too.

Part II is hands down my favorite mindless action movie. Its a shame that they kill his hot girlfriend but how else is he supposed to muster the energy to carjack the copter and destroy the POW camp? Part 1 is a classic. Lets face it , I'd rather watch Part II twice than watch Part 3 once. The fourth one is a modern classic. Thank you Mr. Stallone.",1388102400,,653,4.030769230769231

This was one of two iconic roles for Sylvester Stallone (along with Rocky). This set does not include the recently released 'Rambo' Extended Cut. The films get 4 stars but this release gets 2 stars. It is even lighter than the bloated Rocky BD collection (though there are six films in that franchise). Ignore the Amazon editorial review which refers to the 6-disc DVD collection; this Blu-ray Collector's Set is 4 discs.

In terms of bonus content, Lionsgate shows the most attention towards 'First Blood' and not all of the supplements for that have even been ported over from DVD. A total of over 2 hours of bonus content for 4 films doesn't cut it. The main problem is that an additional 2 hours of vintage features and documentaries that were available in the Special Edition Trilogy BD set and the Complete Collector's DVD Set released earlier are missing. Deleted scenes from Rambo III are also absent. That could have made this a deluxe release.

The presentation of the DVD's is compact and attractive. When playing the DVD's you have several modes to play them in(one is plenty). You get Rambo First Blood. You get Rambo First Blood II. You get Rambo III. You get Rambo (the 4th Rambo movie). Then you get Rambo the digital copy that you can download to your computer and then to I-tunes ect. And you get a DVD with several short films on several different topics (all are interesting). That is 6 quality DVDs for $23.00. That is a deal. If you watched the Rambo movies as a kid, get this package. It is worth every penny. I bought this because my kids love the Rocky movies and I wanted to introduce them to John Rambo.

3382511,4,B0015XHP4A,"The movies speak for themselves. From First Blood to Rambo, we have a iconic and genuine character being put through hell both emotionally and physically. He's a trained killing machine with his own moral code (which in many ways is better than those he's served under). Everyone can sit and debate over Stallone's acting ability, but many really can't discount his writing ability. He tends to have a way with his characters, no matter what movie it is, where the dialog/scenes all work to bring to life a fictional character with both pathos and humanity. So with that being said, I want to speak more on the packaging/features of the film, as everyone who is reading this is probably wondering if this all-in-one is worth it or not. Before I do that I wanted to say that the last Rambo movie, though Rambo is older, is more realistic and just as good as the predecessors. And the documentaries describing how this movie both was true-to-subject matter and a gripping action vehicle is worth watching. Especially when you hear the backstory of Burma and the trials and tribulations that went with getting the film made and getting it seen.

now onto the packaging. It's a regular sized case with all four movies. All look/sound great. They did a great job with the audio/video that's for sure. The extras are on each disc and are definitely worth checking out. I used to own the four dvds that came in a tin and I believe these are the same special features as that set. My only gripe is: (and this is a major pet peeve I have concering complete collections of franchises) The fourth disc says ""disc one"" on the label. I am a collector of movies so I want the best collection I can have, and part of me wanted to go for getting these individually, for one reason it makes my collection seem bigger. I use a cataloguing program to list my dvds, and well it's the difference between one and four. if I buy the complete saga that's just one title etc. However if a good deal comes along where I can get them all together without sacrificing quality then I am all for it. I understand this is easiest for them. But Can't they just press more copies without the ""disc one"" on it? since it is now part of a set and not a standalone. From what I understand this is from a two disc set where the second is just a digital copy. That's fine. I do not lose any special features so I don't feel cheated in that respect. But everytime I look at the discs that extra printing always stands out, and I just know if someone is looking through it they'll wonder where the fifth disc is of the set. I know this is a minor thing to quibble about. But I am picky with my collection. But I wanted to let others know in case this does bother them too.

Also I'd like to point out that First Blood did not work on my pc (which had updated firmware for the drives and the latest cyberlink Powerdvd installed. It worked perfectly on my standalone player though. All the other movies played in my pc without issue. I know part of that is a cyberlink thing and I might just need another patch, but for about three years I have not had to update any of my dvd playing software. So I am not sure what made this one so different. But it plays well in a blu ray player just not a pc drive. I have a big flat panel monitor with logitech thx certified speakers and a thx certified creative sound card, so I like playing it through my pc first and formost. This isn't a major issue either. I just wanted to let everyone know before they bought it. But all of the other played perfectly on my pc without issue. So I'd highly recommend this to everyone basically. It's action with a heart. Yes, it's over the top in some parts, but when Rambo takes out the chopper from hell with a tank, it might seem unbelievable but it's totally cool just the same. Fun to watch and you might learn a few things along the way (like Bill Cosby used to say). The special features are definitely informative not just on the movie but of the political climates of the time. One reason Rambo works is that it's fiction but it's fiction set in real life conflict and in real life facts. So it's great to watch and I'd highly recommend this set as you get four movies at a great price.",1350172800,4,4230,4.332912988650693

Alot of the color and music are now perfect. This is a must own if you love stallones films. I cant wait to get the rocky set to see how well they transfered. Four big stars for this set.

Sound is awesome in surround sound and seems cleaned up over the dvd boxed set. Plenty of bonus features to dive into as well. Awesome packaging keeps the case thin and compact unlike some other sets that feel the need to take up ""book-sized"" space on your shelf.

The Bad: Only thing I don't like is that the version of Rambo(2008) included is simply disc one of the collectors edition. If like me, you like your bonus features you may want to grab the Rambo Trilogy [Blu Ray] instead and opt for  the 2 disc version of Rambo.

My favorite is First Blood (Part 1) because it has the best storyline (if you can have a solid story in this series), but the action is also top-notch.

Rambo (Part 4) is a close second.  Stallone goes out with a bang in the series.  I was hoping Stallone would make a prequel (obviously he would be too old to play Rambo in Vietnam), but still I think a trip to Southeast Asia back in Vietanm could be extremely intense!

3382553,5,B0015XHP4A,"Rambo is the world's greatest hero!

I can never grow tired of watching Rambo movies!

Unlike all the other senseless violence on Hollywood screens, Rambo's
actions make a lot of sense and are fuelled by Justice and Compassion.
I see these 2 important themes played out more than the external
actions of his self defense.

Rambo always fights for a Higher and Greater Cause, unlike the usual
mindless solider in any war that seeks only to suck up to his puppet-
masters dressed in shiny buttons.

Anyone who can transcend the useless ""values"" of the modern world
will always have my admiration. Rambo is one of these admirable
on-screen figures.

Anyone who has ever lived like a poor commoner for years outside
comfortable America can see how a hero like Rambo can really change
things for the better!

Anyone who has ever been betrayed by once trusted authority figures
and evil government agencies can relate very well to Rambo!

I highly recommend Rambo movies to anyone who wants Justice done in this
evil world!

Rambo is much worthy of real life emulation!

A great collector's set this is!

I read reviews about the original special edition discs of the first 3 Rambo flicks and that set was good. Then the Ultimate Edition set came out. Artisan must have really been on drugs to release that set because that set was a pure waste of money (I never said that I bought any of these sets, just heard about them). I saw the Collector's set at a Wal-Mart and I bought it for less than 30 dollars. Great deal since it does have the Ultimate Edition versions of the first 3 films with the new one in a 2-Disc Special edition with a digital copy. The set rounds out with a bonus 6th disc with most of the extras incorporated from the original special edition set. The only thing about the Ultimate Editions that suck are the interactive options features on all three original films. The stuff that is there is not that informative. The commentary tracks are definitely more informative. The new Rambo got the best treatment of them all with all the extras on one disc with disc 2 being the film's digital copy. It should've been on the movie disc and not on a disc of it's own. Stupid. All-in-all, this set is recommended and it is very cheap too. If you cannot find the original special edition set then this collector's set is the one to have. 6 discs at a price less than 30 dollars makes a great deal.

Rambo 1 is a classic, Rambo 2 is a great sequel (a lot of people don't like this one but I think it's slightly underrated), Rambo 3 although, not as good as any of the other 3 still worth watching even though you'll probably find yourself watching the other 3 more than you would this one. Rambo 4 is very good as well, a good way to end the franchise (or is it the end?)

3382569,5,B0015XHP4A,"There's nothing more I could add to how great the ""Rambo"" legacy is.  These movies are all very important to what are Hollywood ""must-haves.""

But, what really makes this collection better than all the previous box sets is the sixth disc.  The loaded ""special features"" DVD.  You get to hear from former special forces agents and retired Vietnam vets and what their take was and what missions they've participated in while in Vietnam.  Plus you get a documentary on Ronald Reagan and his take on his admiration of the John Rambo icon.

But, what I really found interesting is what the war in Afghanistan was all about.  How we went in to get the Russians out, but then left the country poor, devastated, and helpless which allowed the Taliban to finance it's future in away that promoted the ""axis of evil"" yet to come.

This was a very interesting ""Veteran's Day"" for me.  These documentaries were a wealth of information of subjects about war that many of us never really understood before, and therefore, never fully understood why Bush keeps this war alive in Iraq.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not backing Bush. He still failed our nation in many ways (the economy, poor war planning, securing his re-election by tampering with the voter ballots in Florida, supporting the profiting oil industry, etc.) but I wish he never started this war the way he did.  (Remember, it all began with Saddam Hussain, which is no longer a concern).

I didn't mean to drift here, but John Rambo represents a very important icon in pop culture.  As a hero, and as a man in great emotional pain.

The only thing that is weird is that the 5th disc, which got its own panel, is the digital copy of Rambo (2008). I understand why, because we're getting the two disc Rambo (2008), but it just seems odd - overall.

3382603,5,B0015XHP4A,"This set is for any die hard fans that either did not see the first three installments or saw them. This is the best set out there, sure you can get all the movies on single DVD sets. But for $36 dollars, figure. This is a very good investment. It comes fully loaded that will keep you in your seat for some time.

It even has the new ""RAMBO"" film in ""DIGITAL COPY"" that makes you take it where ever you need to go. Simply instruction booklet inside. Also all 6 discs are housed in a metal case, which looks cool on the outside.

It also has a alternate ending to the first film, which I was totally shocked when I saw it. You need to pick this up if your a Rambo Junkie. The replay value on this is phenomenal.

The new ""RAMBO"" will keep you on the edge of your seat as it has the most amazing special effects and gun fights I and friends have ever seen.

Rambo it! John Rambo! A must buy.",1212796800,3,890,4.011299435028248
