3088177,4,B0012EM5CO,"I personally enjoyed this DVD. It had a lot of fun clips from various Mike Douglas shows and brief biographical sketches about Mike and his life and career. I especially enjoyed it on a personal level as my Father was a camera man for the Mike Douglas show when it aired on KYW in Cleveland, OH when I was just a kid. I used to visit the studio during a lot of the shows too, so it brought back a lot of memories. I wish I had known this was being put together as I might have been able to contribute some photos from my Dad's photo file. The only thing I wish would have been different is if they had done it in more chronological order rather than skipping around from earlier to later shows and vice-versa. All in all it was entertaining and good to see more of what happened to Mike after he left Cleveland. P.S. - If anyone knows how to get in touch with Mike's wife or there are more clips from the KYW Cleveland shows available please contact me.",1229040000,,953,4.1567567567567565
3088178,5,B0012EM5CO,"When I saw that anything on the Mike Douglas Show was coming on DVD I can't even explain my joy!!  I remember so fondly watching 'Mike' as he was called in our house every afternoon- 'Mike' was on when my mom was cooking dinner, when I set the table, and lucky for us my dad came home from work about 6 p.m. so we got to watch all of 'Mike' before sitting down to dinner! My mom used to quote him as if he were a personal friend...but then again he sort of was our friend. Mike Douglas brought family entertainment into our homes for two decades. His show also introduced the younger audiences to the likes of Totie Fields, Vincent Price, Marty Allen, Pat Cooper and how about the weekly guest hosts? Who can ever forget the week that John & Yoko hosted!
Even the BeeGees made three apperances! I loved this DVD but....I want MORE!!! Please give us more of Mike on DVD....pleeeease!!!!!!",1225756800,9,887,4.375757575757576
3088179,5,B0012EM5CO,"This DVD is exactly what its title indicates: Moments and Memories.  Many future stars perform in their relatively fledgling careers and the ever present Mike Douglas smoothly transitions from one segment to the next.  One is reminded of the graciousness which permeated his shows.  Anyone who is interested in hearing wonderful songs, sung on pitch, not screached or drummed to the nth degree should enjoy the music.  Anyone interested in good fun will enjoy the more comedic segments.  Anyone who thirsts for good clean humor and honesty of performance should enjoy this DVD.",1211587200,4,577,5.161290322580645

3088181,5,B0012EM5CO,"I saw parts of this video on a PBS special, and loved it and wanted to see the whole thing!  I don't remember ever watching the Mike Douglas show when I was younger.  He was a daytime talk show host like Johnny Carson was a night time talk show host.  As I watched the video, soon my husband and 17-year-old daughter were watching with me, and we were all really enjoying it!  There are great interviews, some funny, some poignant.  In a way, it's a tribute to Mike Douglas the man, using those who knew him and interviews and clips from his show to illustrate their impressions of him. It's only about an hour, and we wished it were longer!  We'll be watching it again with our other children when they come home to visit.",1209427200,7,723,4.318518518518519

The transfer of these tapes isn't quite as good as I had hoped for, for instance the John and Yoko sections look so much better on the old VHS box set I have from Rhino. The Rolling Stones is a highlight for me since I'd been looking for a clip of it for 30 years.

3088183,5,B0012EM5CO,"There's some stellar material on this disc. We see a complete song performance of the Stones in their prime, a youthful rocking Mick and a harmonica playing Brian, doing Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away. There's the fabled hosting of the show by John and Yoko, with a lovely rendition of Imagine by John, who then joins with Chuck Berry in Johnny B. Goode. A two year old Tiger Woods shows his precocious skill, flanked by Bob Hope and Jimmy Stewart. Great clips of Alfred Hitchcock, MLK, Alex Haley; Rodney Dangerfield; it's a huge list of performers and prominent men and women who really made a difference, in marked contrast to the People Magazine celebrity, designer fashion, can't-write-or-play-but-is-a good-dancer present day line up of those in the public eye.

Mike Douglas was a great guy; calm, warm, hip, open-minded, aware of what really mattered in his day. This PBS special is a wonderful testimonial to him and his times; perhaps they'll come again, who knows. At the moment it's looking fairly promising!",1206489600,21,1017,4.947368421052632

While it was a great tribute to Mike Douglas' life, clips seemed random (who decided to show only seconds of several stars' acts but an entire song by John Lennon which is on its own DVD anyway?) - This DVD was over and I was wondering where the rest of it was.

3088229,5,B0012EM5CO,"One of the best things that Mike Douglas ever did on his shows was to let his guests speak while we all listened. The best part was that it began with him, how he approached his guests, how he appreciated his audiences, and how he let us listen in - as though we were in the front room sitting there with him.

We are treated to a rare insight into the master files of a master interviewer, a thorough story teller and exceptional entertainer. Mike Douglas' mix of humor, courtesy and pure interest in his guests comes through time and again. Unlike other talk-show hosts who oft times appear to be caught up in the clock and seemingly distracted by what's coming next, a viewer gets the sense that what is happening at that moment is what is important; to Mike Douglas great credit, that was each of us.

Mike Douglas' Moments & Memories should be mandatory viewing for any would-be journalist or broadcast host because this man really was the Dean of the School of the very best interview techniques. - Prof Mike Haller",1278633600,4,1021,4.513513513513513

It was about 56 minutes long. I saw an Amazon.com ad that said it was 115 minutes long, so  ordered it, expecting to see an expanded version. It was 56 minutes long.  There was an option to view an ""extra"" which merely allowed for viewing clips from the show individually.  If you count this as additional video, the total is 112 minutes.

This DVD brings back lots of good memories of when TV talk/variety shows were worth watching.

Most of the shows best years and highest ratings were done in Philadelphia 1965-1978 though the DVD fails to make that clear.

Wish that the clips were identified by year but they are not.

Technical quality shows the amazing evolution of TV technology from 1961 black and white and the relatively new medium of videotape (then just 5 years old) to super sharp broadcast color done in Los Angeles.  It's also curious to watch how the show developed from a very low budget local show in Cleveland to a nationally syndicated program shown in 170 markets and watched by at least six million people 5 days a week.
