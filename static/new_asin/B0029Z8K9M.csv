8358620,3,B0029Z8K9M,"This DVD was just ""okay"". My husband loves watching cooking shows, so I thought he would like it.

Pros:
There are several very simple dishes that are made, in the video. None of them call for exotic ingredients, or elaborate preparation.
It is short enough to keep one's attention.

Cons:
The Margaritas made by Ming, did not seem to fit with the rest of the video.
The orchestrating was extremely obvious.

Husband did like it, though...",1424044800,,439,4.75
