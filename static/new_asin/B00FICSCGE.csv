5993283,5,B00FICSCGE,"I've been away from step for a while, due to some foot and hip injuries.  When this workout arrived, I just had to try it.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

Cathe is doing a great job at giving something for everyone. The workout as is clocks in at 53:42 and consists of a warm-up, 6 step combos and a cooldown.  There are many premixes ranging from 30 - 74 minutes.  The longer premixes include the Bonus Step routine.  I can't wait to try that one.  I've been doing the original workout.  Since I workout at 5 am, my brain isn't quite ready to take on the bonus step routine as well.

Why I liked this workout:

* Cathe.  What can I say; she is a master instructor and motivator.  Since I have every workout she has ever made, I feel like she is an old friend.

* The combinations were dancey and made you think, but they weren't impossible to get.  I compare this workout to Amy Bento step workouts.  Amy does lots of complex moves and I keep having to replay the sections.  This gets tiring after a while and I give up.  Cathe is very good at breaking down complex moves.  Of course, it will take a few tries to get all the moves, but it gives me something to work toward.

At first, I didn't find this workout too intense, but that's okay. It's funny, about halfway through the workout I realized that I was breathing hard and I didn't even notice it!  I was so engaged in figuring out the step routines.  Now that is fun exercise - when you don't even realize you are working out hard.

I didn't particularly care for the music; it was back to the annoying whining music.  But, that's easily fixed with this DVD since you have 3 music options - normal, instrumental and no music.  So, I can deal with the music issue.

One thing I didn't like about this workout was all the moving and stepping lengthwise across the step.  I was afraid that I would trip over my feet and fall flat on my face.  For those that are more coordinated, this will not be a problem.

I do recommend this workout for those who like choreographed step.  It's fun and it will make you think.  You'll be smiling all day long after you do this workout.",1380758400,38,2139,4.2227722772277225
5993294,5,B00FICSCGE,It took a few times to get the steps down but now that I know the routine it is a blast!  I love bench step aerobics and Cathe makes it so much fun!  She is a very talented and inspiring individual.  I love all of her workout dvds I have purchased.  I just bought Party Rockin Step 2 and very excited for it to come!,1494547200,,316,3.8153846153846156
5993295,1,B00FICSCGE,I use to love step so decided to purchase a step and this DVD. I could not follow along it was to fast and she does not break it down. Unless you do step daily I would not purchase. I was very disappointed.,1493251200,,206,3.813953488372093
5993296,5,B00FICSCGE,I too have been doing step for over 10 years now and this by far is the most interesting step workout I've ever seen in my life. I can't wait to try this video! I've been going to a gym for years and always thought the step routines were a little boring. Kathy definitely brings step workouts to the next level for me!,1492128000,,318,4.063492063492063

5993301,3,B00FICSCGE,"You will need to watch and do this video a few times before you will feel like you are getting a good workout. Cathe does not break down any of the moves and it can get frustrating trying to figure out what she is doing at full tempo. I wish Cathe would have an option of the seeing the moves broken down. I take step class every week and am not a slow learner and I had to play portions of this DVD in slow motion to figure out what the moves were supposed to look like. I felt like I fumbled around half of the video. I got very frustrated and finally turned the the DVD off. I am so disappointed, as I love Cathe's workouts.",1472256000,,627,3.9448818897637796
5993302,3,B00FICSCGE,Very advanced.  The only reason I gave it three starts is because I couldn't keep up.  I do Billy Blanks Tae Bo - and wasn't familiar with the moves she was doing and there was no introduction - just jumped right into the moves.,1470614400,,228,4.159090909090909

5993307,5,B00FICSCGE,"This video seems overwhelmingly complicated at first but if you are familiar with Cathe's choreography at all, you'll catch on quicker than you think.  Once you get it down, this workout is crazy fun and a great calorie burner.",1453075200,,227,4.82051282051282
5993308,5,B00FICSCGE,"Cathe makes me feel like I am dancing, so the workout passes quickly.  She gives great cues, so I can follow easily.  Not that this is an easy workout.  It took me several times of going through it and replaying to get it all down, but the time was well worth it.  And I can do a premix when I don't have a full hour to devote to my exercising.  Thanks, Cathe.",1447372800,,360,3.9444444444444446
5993309,3,B00FICSCGE,"I've done step for years & always loved it. I saw Cathe's videos came highly recommended & praised so I figured I purchase this video & give it a try. I could see how this could be a great workout, if she would give a tutorial in the beginning of the tape. However, that's not what happens...the video starts off with a warm-up aka full blown cardio mode & Cathe references moves I have never ever seen or heard of in my entire stepping career.  By the time you have rewound the dvd a few times & finally learned 1 of 3 interesting unheard of moves, Cathe has jumped onto the next one. Very challenging especially if you're not a dancer who can pick up steps in a split second...Anyhow, so all in all okay....one day in the future when I have time to study each move, then I might get in a good workout in with this video.",1445558400,2,822,4.169811320754717
5993310,1,B00FICSCGE,"I recommend not purchasing this workout. It could have been a fantastic cardio and toning workout.  But, sadly, the instructor Cathe is very poor at cueing up the next exercise and instructing on the movements.  Either while or just before moving into the next exercise, she calls out the name and/or the movement. And the exercises are NOT simple, but very complex foot work. Also, as she moves into the next exercise, she does so at the regular pace, rather than slowing down the movements the first time through.  So the person exercising is immediately behind and playing catch up.  It becomes very frustrating and discouraging.",1440460800,4,632,4.933962264150943
5993311,1,B00FICSCGE,"I've only done one Cathe Friedrich step video before, this being several years ago, and remember it as being a good workout. I've been doing step for almost 10 years and thought I'd give this video a try for home workouts. Mistake! Several other ladies are working out alongside Cathe, but no one is doing modifications as far as I can tell. I can usually create my own modifications even without an example stepper on screen, but was unable to do so in this case because the moves were so complicated. Cuing is minimal, and she uses names that I've never heard of for some of the steps. I've always avoided twirling/spinning moves because they make me dizzy...and found almost nothing but in several of the workouts. The warm-up was hardly a warm-up -- more like jumping right into full cardio mode. My goal with home fitness DVD's is to be able to jump right in and get a good workout instead of having to rewind or stare helplessly at the screen for minutes at a time. Cathe at one point introduced a new move by stating that the viewer would probably have to rewind several times to be able to understand what was going on. I wasn't able to get through the whole video because it was so hard to follow. This was a waste of money.",1439078400,3,1233,4.412280701754386
5993312,4,B00FICSCGE,"I really like it although not for beginners. I do get frustrated since she doesn't go through the steps slowly enough and it will take awhile before I can actually get through one set without stopping to try to figure out what the heck she's doing. That said, I know once I figure out what the steps are this will be a favorite and I probably won't get tired of it for quite a while. But I sure wish she would go through each step at half time just once. Maybe she has a beginner DVD that I can start with.",1438560000,,506,4.01980198019802
5993313,1,B00FICSCGE,"I was excited to get this DVD for what I expected to be a fun hour long step workout. However, the moves were too complicated from the beginning and not well cued. The thing is, a step is already a little dangerous because of the height. Add complicated moves and poor cues, and your attention is scattered when you really need to be focused. I truly believe there is a high probability that people who do this workout will hurt themselves.",1437004800,,440,4.444444444444445
5993314,3,B00FICSCGE,"Way out of my league. It's been a wile since I stepped so in trying to get back into it, this is definitely not that way to go. HOWEVER, I look forward to enjoying some time in the future.",1433116800,,188,3.8461538461538463

5993319,3,B00FICSCGE,"This workout will definitely get your heart rate up, but it will also test your patience. Cathe doesn't slow down to teach new moves or combos, which makes for a frustrating workout. I think if she offered a preview or, again, slowed down the initial introduction of combos, I would be more inclined to rate it 4/5 stars.",1425254400,,321,4.551724137931035

5993325,5,B00FICSCGE,"This is a great workout, but it is definitely full of dance moves that you have to practice to get, especially if you are a beginner to step (and exercising), like I am.  I have done it over and over and still haven't gone through the whole video--partially because I get frustrated, but also partially because I am not in shape and need to build up how long I exercise.

Anyway, I definitely think it is worth learning to do.  Once you get the moves, it is a ton of fun and the time flies by, which is why I keep doing it!  Despite the learning curve, I recommend it.",1417651200,,568,4.136363636363637

5993331,5,B00FICSCGE,"This is an awesome workout. I agree with other reviews that it moves fast and is a bit more complicated than other step workouts; I played it in slow motion and repeated as needed till i figured it out. Now that I have it all down, however, I am glad it moves fast and doesn't have a ton of instruction because it helps make it a better and more intense workout. It's just the initial process of learning the moves that is difficult. I love this video and also bought the second one which I am excited to start learning.",1408320000,3,520,4.21

5993334,5,B00FICSCGE,"I love Zumba!  I love the Firm!  I love Plyometrics, Squats, planks (well, not so much), lifting weights, hiking, mountain bike riding, blah, blah, blah.  Let's face it.  I generally love it all!  But sometimes, I just want something basic in moves but still challenging.  That is where Cathe Friedrich: Party Rockin Step Workout #1 comes in.  Step aerobics is what I used years ago to bring me into shape.  I loved it so much, that I purchased another stepper recently after my friend accidentally threw out my first one years ago.  I just received this video the other day and have been using it along with my other workout dvds.  I usually work out twice per day and like to mix up my routines for maximum results and so that I do not get bored.  So don't give up on step aerobics.  Sure, it may not be as challenging as some of the newer workouts out there; but it's still fun and still good to incorporate to avoid boredom.  One last thing.  My friend, who is only 40 years old, lost all of her vision in one eye and most of her vision in the other eye (due to diabetes) at the age of 37. She works out with me now, often complaining that she is not exactly coordinated, which is why we never do Zumba together.  However, I noticed yesterday, that she is mastering a great deal of these moves on this video, which is wonderful.  I thought this video might be too advanced.  Therefore, if you're not exactly coordinated, step aerobics might be the thing for you.  This is moderately advanced for most; but you'll get it.  And don't be appalled about me sharing my friend's story.  She asks me to share her story often to help educate and motivate others.  Get this video.",1403136000,28,1675,4.390879478827362

5993339,4,B00FICSCGE,"Once again Cathe kills it, but, you have to move along quickly as she does move along, you have to pause at times and practice the basic and then play and pause again, after just playing four min over and over again, it comes to you and you can move along, she goes along quite quickly.",1392422400,2,286,4.125
5993340,5,B00FICSCGE,"I gotta admit. The first time I did this workout it was very very frustrating. I didn't think I would ever play it again. I have done step workouts for years, but this was my first Cathe Friedrich workout video. I had never seen any of her ""usual"" moves before or was use to her style. I decided to give it another shot and after about the 3rd time (with a lot of slow mo playing) I finally got all the moves. She does use some moves that are complicated and that I feel are almost awkward at times, but the time does fly and you really do have fun doing step. If you are looking for a no thinking step workout or not willing to put time into learning the moves, I wouldn't get this DVD.

My only other complaint is that I can't believe the lack of adequate cool down. Almost baffling. I have to pause the workout before the cool down and do a little on my own.

But overall you do get a lot for your money and I enjoy the workout. There are even bonus step sections and I really like all the premixes.",1392249600,24,1002,4.030150753768845

I haven't been doing step since childhood or teenage years, I just started about 10 years ago, on and off. But I did start with cathe. I've learned that you grow with her. If I were to start with her newer stuff I wouldn't know what over face in and over was, around the world, etc, and I wouldn't be comfortable with spinning. Since I started with her older stuff I've gotten more comfortable with all that. Basic step, body fusion, low impact step, etc taught me the basics, then I was able to move to her Imax dvds and to rythmic step.
