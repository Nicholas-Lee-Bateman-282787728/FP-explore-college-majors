6078102,5,B00GIARSV0,"The processing and shipping of this product from the seller was amazing.
Arrived ahead of time and in excellent condition. The movie itself was alright, it's a low budget film after all. It was an impulse buy after I started watching The Tomorrow People staring Robbie Amell.
It was defiantly worth the watch.",1395273600,,309,4.849056603773585
6078103,3,B00GIARSV0,"I knew I was in trouble when the DVD opened up with previews for ""Space Camp."" This is the story of a family of Indian Jones types who hunt artifacts from fairy tales, legends, and history. In this story they introduce the characters as they search for the shards to the broken mirror from ""Snow White."" The film had promise in the beginning with exotic scenery, but then quickly switches to exotic places like Boston. The plot was a bit confusing as the shards were hidden so they couldn't be found, so they go find them before the bad guys can find them...making it easier for the ""Krugen.""

There is one scene where we see a bathtub Porsche filled with blue Walmart reusable bags which had me shaking my head. Does Walmart really need the product placement? The film was an ""Eh-Okay"" production, most likely a company composed of Amazon reviewers. Who gives themselves a title of mediocrity? Oh, they're Canadians. My bad.

I haven't figured out why no one used a real gun. They used single shot arrow-guns instead, which are bulkier. The acting was so-so. Alexa Vega, the eye candy wasn't convincing as the best lines were written for Tripp (Keenan Tracey) something parents name their kids when they conceive on acid.

Kids might like it. This is similar to ""The Librarian"" series which I thought was infinitely better.",1384646400,14,1324,4.7229437229437226

TO RESTATE WAKKYWABBITS REVIEW>>
This is a movie directed at a younger audience but one older people can enjoy. It reminds me of a Disney movie, kinda like SpyKids. It is very G rated.

This is not a B movie. Everything is well done. Filming and audio are excellent.

Premise: Two teenage boys, sons of famous treasure hunters, plus cute girl, are off to find Mom and Dad and the missing pieces of Snow White's mirror.

Action is good. Well choreographed fight scenes, nothing harsh. Again, very G rated.

Acting: If there is any part where the movie lags, it is in the acting. It is not bad acting, but a movie geared toward younger audiences. The way the mother acts/talks came across as a bit ""different"" to me.

Family friendly: Yep, very family friendly. Just a few fight scenes. No bad words. No nekkid people. One cute kiss.

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was fun. It kept my attention the entire time. This is a movie I will rent again when my nephew is over for projector movie night when Grandma, Grandpa and little Sis are visiting. I think everyone will enjoy. There may be a sequel.<<<",1435104000,2,1269,4.559471365638767
