8501570,5,B006O2L1X8,Another of an very old movie of 1947 with hit songs and family drama of love triangle and the sacrifices which accompany even in real life. Excellent original poster. Suraiya was a great actress and a talented singer and often acted with the legendary Noor Jehan. Diamond entertainment also added a set of movie at no charge but out of appreciation and goodwill and I am ever grateful for the real treat out of Indian Hospitality.,1457481600,,430,4.671052631578948
