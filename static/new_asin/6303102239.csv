560883,4,6303102239,"The script for this movie was apparently rumoured to be one of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood. At times, I can see why. The best scene in the movie as far as acting and screenplay go is when Gary Oldman and Annabella Sciorra are sitting on their front porch at night. The conversation begins as small talk and,imperceptibly, quite beautifully unfolds into a deep talk about love, happiness, and the overall meaning of life. Kudos to the actors and screenwriter Hilary Henkin for an outstanding moment.

What hurts the movie most is the combination of director Peter Medak and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski. The flashy and cluttered visual style--though certainly very accomplished at times--obstructs the flow of the narrative.

Probably the one thing to tip the movie into the must-see bin is the presence of Ms. Lena Olin. I can't say she's a great actress, but at 5 feet 11 inches tall with buns of steel and a real talent for malice, she fits the part of assassin perfectly. All the other actors are respected and professional figures--Oldman, Sciorra, Scheider, and Juliette Lewis--but Olin tears through the movie with wicked glee as if she's having the greatest time wrecking everything and everybody in her path.

In sum, this is one of those cult movies that's good but not great. The problem with many such movies is that many lovers of cult movies insist that cult movies fail at the box office because we Americans don't appreciate true art. Truth is, lots of ""cult"" movies just aren't that good. They're a step out of the mainstream which is refreshing now and then, but that's it.",1437436800,,1605,4.850364963503649

560932,1,6303102239,"***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Love the song by Tom Waits (and later) MC 900 Foot Jesus.  Unlike the song, which is about an anti-hero who avenges his brother's killing by a presumably crooked cop, this movie is ABOUT a crooked cop.  Huh?  That aside, for me it was pointless, an exercise in futility.  Dramatic, well-filmed, well-acted- it falls down on characterization (there was little), and plot (he's a slimy guy dealing with even WORSE guys- you can't trust anybody, and it's going to turn out badly- SURPRISE).  His women, who are supposed to be either good, dumb and predictable, or of use, anyway, turn out to be fickle, useless, disloyal, even deadly.  The women are like a dim-witted 13-year old kid's idea of what women are like.  Good, bad, sexy, devious, stupid, smart.  Such extremes, such a WASTE of talent.  I could just HEAR Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra and Juliette Lewis unloading to their SOs at the end of the day about the CRAP they had to endure to get a paycheck.

Gary Oldman is a favorite of mine, with endless depths, and pro that he is made this paper-thin guy seem more complex than written- Oldman magic.  But even he couldn't overcome the witless script.  The Roy Scheider business was skin-crawlingly of the jerk-your-chain variety- ""Look at this- isn't it shocking- Lena Olin is REALLY BAD.""  I like sex and violence fine in movies when they advance the plot or reveal characters' inner truths, but not when they're purely gratuitous and there to DISTRACT you from the fact that the movie is a flash package with zilch inside.  Or maybe the point went right over my head. What was it? Life sucks, people suck, bad (or stupid) guys finish last?  And..?

For some reason, I'm not sure why, I kept thinking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywoodland/dp/B002BU11UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywoodland</a>&nbsp;while watching this- with similar themes and film noir-ish, but for me, intriguing, mysterious, sad, affecting, important somehow.  It too was peppered with bad guys, violence, and desire- gave no definitive answers but I felt I'd learned volumes about the characters, whether good, bad, successful, scheming, second-rate, yearning, whatever.  Somehow it seemed the opposite of Romeo is Bleeding.  (Maybe it was the fact that it was a true story, and easier to root for Superman than a slimeball cop out to screw anybody he could.)  FINALLY, at the end he blubbers because things didn't go his way. MAN UP, for godsakes!",1421884800,,2506,5.155940594059406

561224,5,6303102239,"I admit my 5 star rating seems generous, but considering all the factors I think this film deserves it. For one thing Romeo is Bleeding is filled with its own style and is always original. There really is no movie you will ever see at all like it. It never goes where you expect it to and manages to suprise you every step of the way. Films nowadays just don't do that much anymore. Though it has a very familiar plot its still very unique and extremely interesting. So a corrupt cop can end up making a real mess out of his life if he is not careful. For Gary Oldmans Jack Grimaldi, his biggest stumbling block is his own romantic dreams and his complete lack of common sense or control. This film was a real strange one. One minute you think it might go in one direction but it takes you on a most bizzare ride. Moody, gritty, complex and dark. Though the film has a very low budget feel to it, I really found it hard to forget. Oldman was pitch perfect with the script, which pretty much called for him to play this role rather understated and dull. But hes so good at it that you just love to watch him do his magic onscreen. This guy is really an amazing actor. Along for the ride are Lena Olin who was masterfully psychotic as a russian mobster who you just know is as evil as anyone could possibly be, but she knows how to push all of Jacks buttons to bewitch him and she utterly ruins his life in the end. And Juliette Lewis who is just cute as a button as Jacks girl on the side. And Roy Schieder as a mob boss is always great and I liked him here as well. Anyway Jack ends up loosing everything, and by the last act things take a suprising turn and Jack gets a somewhat happy ending. This film was stylishly odd with a touch of dreamy noir. This is a rather overlooked gem of unusually compelling and originally gritty film making that I really enjoyed.",1367884800,2,1863,4.192200557103064

I was spellbound before even arriving.  There were only 5-6 others in the theater - the movie was gone within a week.  I proceeded to watch it many times at home on video even before its video release a full year later (I had run onto one new 8-track tape in a collection of current movies at a downtown drugstore display).  In total, I've seen ""Romeo"" no less than 26 times.  The movie, of course, was superb - but it has held and has revealed much more for me regarding my own life.  (And, I'm saying this realizing the expected, ""Huh?"")  Each major scene has been symbolic (a highly-exaggerated symbolism, but highly relative) to my life.  Most scenes were easily understood for their mirroring qualities; however, when Lena screamed ""Snake Eyes!"", even knowing her story with Jack, I didn't relate - I marveled at just what could trigger such intensity - how that could be?  Many years later, as a last revelation for me, I heard myself screaming this very phrase from the depths of my soul and pulling my fists in the air while driving on a freeway one afternoon.

Ridiculous that history is being rewritten even for things that don't really matter.

Yes, I saw the scene where she sawed off her own arm years ago when I first watched it on with my daughter. When I watched the DVD a few weeks before Christmas this year because that was the *only* scene I remembered from this movie and I wanted to pay more attention to it this time around, I found to my shock the scene had been deleted. It's so obvious too... quick cut to her suddenly having an arm wrapped up.

Am I the only one who saw that scene? No. Others have as well and have said so here and on IMDB only to be ridiculed and told that even the director said there was never such a scene in the film.

You can find the Lena Olin interview with Leno on lenaolin dot net, under the Lena Olin Articles. Quoted here:

Jay: You do a lot of fighting in this (meaning Romeo Is Bleeding). I was telling the audience before the show, this is the strangest character. I guess it would be, you play this female mob boss. Would that be?

Lena: Yeah, that's correct.

Jay: Who is like the toughest person I've ever seen in a movie. Am I giving it away by saying...
(makes cutting motion on his arm)

Lena: No, no no. (highly amused by all this talk of Mona)

Jay: I mean, she cuts her own arm off with a saw, to kind of make a point I guess.

561294,5,6303102239,"`Romeo is Bleeding' is an edgy, violent and disturbing cop film from '94 starring Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors and the beautiful Lena Olin. Generally I'm not a big fan of this genre of film but the presence of Oldman and Olin was too much of a temptation for me to resist.

Synopsis: Oldman is spot on as Jack Grimaldi, the amoral New York detective and cheating husband who makes the decision to amass his own personal fortune by selling pertinent information to the local bad guys. As you might expect things eventually begin to go wrong and the collateral damage caused by his actions soon become too much for him to handle. No longer able to survive by just selling information in exchange for money, he finds himself faced with a kill or be killed situation involving a crazed and alluring professional killer (Lena Olin). Whatever he does the consequences are dire and his future and the fate of others are in jeopardy. This is a lose-lose situation if there ever was one.

Critique: This is one of those movies that you'll either love or hate, there's no middle ground here. The cast of characters are for the most part seedy, unlikable lowlifes who go about the daily routine of doing their job without thought, reflection or remorse, thus there are no heroes to root for. Much like a Quentin Tarantino film it's not about good and evil, it about survival of the fittest and what one must endure to be the last one standing when the dust finally settles.

Again, not my usual cup of tea but I have to say this is one you'll definitely remember, Oldman and Olin are amazing. I was particularly impressed by Lena Olin, I always thought she was nothing more than a pretty face but I definitely was wrong. Her performance was absolutely unnerving and unforgettable.",1295481600,2,1779,4.6234177215189876

561296,5,6303102239,"Romeo is Bleeding is a modern film noir - a true classic that is on a par with any of the classic film noirs from the 50s. It has all the right ingredients - treacherous femme fatales (more than one, in fact), a cast of sleazy characters, a protagonist who gets drawn into a situation from which he can't excise himself, and lots of death and destruction. All this, and an all star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Juliette Lewis, Anabella Sciorra, and Roy Scheider.

Gary Oldman is one of the best actors around these days. He can be outrageously over the top (""Sid & Nancy"", ""The Professional"", ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", ""Hannibal"") or understated (""The Dark Knight"",  ""Batman Begins"", ""JFK"") in the more than 50 films he's appeared in since 1982. His role as the crooked cop  Grimaldi is one of his finest performances ever.

The only thing outshining Oldman is Swedish actress Lena Olin who plays a Russian assassin with more than a few tricks up her sleeve. Olin has been nominated for an Oscar (""Enemies""), a Golden Globe (""Unbearable Lightness of Being"") a BAFTA (""Chocolat""), and an Emmy (""Alias""). For her role in this film she received a, MTV Movie Award nomination for ""Best Action Sequence"" for her fight in the car.

Sexy Annabella Sciorra plays Oldman's suffering wife. We know her best as the Emmy nominated depressed and ultimately suicidal girlfriend of Tony Soprano, but she's been in a few dozen films (""Cadillac Man"", ""Cop Land"", ""Above Suspicion"", ""Jungle Fever"") as well as recurring roles in other TV series (e.g., Detective Barek on ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"", Nora Skoff on ""Mental"").Sciorra does a terrific job in this film, a quiet counterpoint to her more flamboyant co-stars.

Talking about flamboyant, Juliette Lewis turns in another stunning performance in this film as Oldman's mistress. Probably best known for her early work as the child in ""Cape Fear"" (1992) for which she received an Oscar nomination, Lewis has given great performances in films like ""Kalifornia"" (1993), ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994), and ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" (1996). Personally I think her best role was in ""What's Eating Gilber t Grape"" (1993).

Roy Scheider has given so many great performances it's hard to know where to start. He was the detective in ""The French Connection"" (1971) and the director in ""All That Jazz"" (1979) - getting Oscar nods for both roles. He was also the police chief in ""Jaws"" (1975) and the police helicopter pilot in ""Blue Thunder"" (1983) and for two years played Captain Bridger in TV's ""Sea Quest"". In this film he plays a Mafia don who orders Oldman to kill Olin.

The film is directed by Peter Medak who is best known for ""The  Ruling Class"" (1972), ""A Day in the Life of Joe Egg"" (1972), and ""The Krays"" (1990). Medak works mainly on episodic TV, usually on cop shows like ""Cold Case"" and ""Homicide"". Medak's films often deal with dysfunctional relationships and often display a quirky black humor. Those qualities are clearly on display in ""Romeo"".

Hillary Henkin wrote the screenplay and co-produced. Henkin is best known for her work on ""Wag the Dog"" (1997) for which she received an Oscar and a Golden Globe nomination. Her other screenplays include ""Road House"" (1989) and ""Prisoners"" (1981), but nothing in any of her other works will prepare you for ""Romeo is Bleeding"".

Co-producer Paul Webster has a long list of quirky films in his history - ""Little Odessa"" (1994),  ""Sexy Beast"" (2000), ""Invincible"" (2001), and ""Eastern Promises"" (209097) to name a few. Webster received an Oscar and a BAFTA nomination for ""Atonement"" (2007) as well as a BAFTA nomination for ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005).

The film was a commercial and a critical failure. It grossed less than $4 million worldwide on a $10 million budget. Roger Ebert said it had ""overwrought style and overwritten melodrama"". Over time it has achieved cult status as a modern film noir.

Film noir fans should be required to see this film. Fans of great acting will enjoy the film, and the film has equally impressive direction, photography, and music. But it isn't for the faint of heart.",1276732800,4,4109,4.87661406025825

561298,5,6303102239,"I bought this dvd about three years and have probably watched it over thirty times since. For me it's a great treatment of obsessive/addictive behaviour wrapped up in a sylish and sexy crime drama. It's about obsession/addiction for love,for sex and for money. Jack Grimaldi(played by Gary Oldman) is led by ""that old voice in the back of his head"" which rendered him powerless to his obsessions/addictions. Essentially he cannot function without living life on the edge and in doing so he puts his marriage, his job and especially his life on the line. Neither his sanity nor his judgment was ever in question as he clearly never possessed any. His nemesis in the form of the female lead mobster Mona De Markoff(played by Lena Olin) represented everything he ever wanted but never had ie power, style, sensuality and ruthlessness. She was the perfect woman for him and he could do nothing to stop himself from gravitating towards her into a debauched and downward spiral of corruption, criminality, unabated sexual attraction and ultimate self destruction.

Over and above this what appealed to me was the excellent photography, lighting and sylishness of the film and the sensitivity of the script which could only have been written by a woman. I love this film!!!!!!",1211414400,3,1269,4.985849056603773

From the moment Lena Olin delivers the most potent two-word warning; ""Keep lookin',"" I've ever heard in film, to the bizarre and beautiful fade-out at the desolate Holiday Dinner, you're emersed in a dark, deadly, moral wasteland,inhabited by some of the most finely drawn feral characters you'll ever run into on the far side of the Styx.

Olin delivers a tour-de-force, as femme-fatale Mona Demarkov, a psychotic Russsian hitwoman, but Gary Oldman isn't far behind her with his portrayal of Jack Grimaldi, a sexually obsessed, crooked cop who tangles with Mona. The supporting cast is killer, and dead-bang on target, with: Annabella Sciorra in a subtle triumph as Jack's wife, Julliet Lewis perfect as Jack's ditzy girlfriend, Roy Schieder is chilling as Mona's gangster kingpin nemisis, Michael Wincott comes on sinister and solid, as Schieder's top thug. Ron Pearlman and Will Patton are excellent, and Dennis Farina delivers a hilarious cameo. For fun, see if you can spot 'Paulie Walnuts' of Tony Soprano's crew, romping with a couple of hookers.

Peter Medak's direction is pure genius, producing a film that is hard and tightly woven as chainmail. Mark Isam's haunting score caps a fine cinematic experience.

561333,3,6303102239,"Romeo is Bleeding could have been a quintessential new film noir classic. The plot line was thrilling, and Lena Olin was particularly mysterious and devious as the Russian hitwoman. Needless to say, Gary Oldman's performance was stellar as the duplicitous cop. However, the DVD version cuts a very crucial scene. I saw this movie at the theatre when it was released. There is a scene in which Gary Oldman shoots Lena Olin in the arm before putting her in handcuffs; instead of going to a hospital, they get into a fight. While he's driving, she's in the back seat of the car attacking him with the only weapons available to her at the time--her legs.  Eventually Gary Oldman crashes his car, and Lena Olin runs away from him (handcuffed, no less),then, rather than go to a hospital, she retreats to her apartment where she cuts off her own arm with a power saw. This scene was brutally shocking, but it augmented the sinister dynamic of Lena Olin's character. More importanly, it explained how she became armless. This was the kind of scene that put the viewer on the edge of his seat anxiously awaiting the unfolding of the next event. Cutting that particular scene caused major incongruity because when Gary Oldman and Lena Olin crash the car, she fights with him and then runs away, hands cuffed behind her back, and at that point, the movie immediately cuts to a scene in which her arm is missing, with nothing in between--no explanation for the missing arm. Anyone who hasn't seen the movie before is going to be confused. The viewer will be left wondering what the heck happened to her arm.  This will leave you very frustrated because for the remainder of the film you'll be wondering how she became an armless hitwoman. That was one scene that should not have ended up on the cutting floor.  The film editors made a huge error in judgment.",1147651200,65,1847,4.659509202453988
561334,5,6303102239,"Probably everyone has one favorite movie that they consider ""their own"" because few, if any, of their friends share their admiration for it. Mine is this one. I just love this film.

It is only one out of over 5,000 movies have either rented or purchased that I watched back-to-back nights after seeing it for the first time. A dozen viewings later, It's still just as good, if not better. It is, start-to-finish, the most entertaining crime movie I have ever watched.

Being of fan of film noir, those wonderfully-narrated crime films of the '40s and '50s, Romeo Is Bleeding is right up my alley. I may be wrong but believe this whole film is simply a parody of the film noirs: an outrageous take on those movies with an over-the-top villain (Lena Olin, the most fascinating female I have ever come across on film), along with over-the-top characters, action scenes, dialog and narration. It's a wild, fun - albeit sick - ride, not to be taken seriously (which a lot of people did and then thought it was too goofy). Evidence of this film-noir spoof is in the dialog, with a number of fantastic dark-humor lines, many delivered by Olin. One has to see this a number of times to catch all the humor in here. Kudos to screenplay writer Hilary Henkin for her work.

Oldman is superb and its the glue that holds this unique story in tact. His narration, including the exaggerated inflection in his voice, is fantastic. I appreciate the American accent this British actor used, too. Olin, as Russian hit- woman Mona Demarkoff, she is one character I guarantee you will not ever forget. Roy Scheider, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis, Michael Wincott and others - cameos by Dennis Farina and Ron Perlman - all deliver great performances with lines that, well,....as I said, are outrageous.

Gary Oldman is the cop with his hand in everything . . . and up everything. Lena Olin is fabulous as the beautiful but evil temptress and mobster's moll. But fear not! She's no sweetheart to feel pity for. There is no mucking about in this story with shedding tears for the ruined virgin. If a woman can be a rapist, then look no further. This is a story of pure obsession, and a desire to possess without reason. Murder, torture, adultry, there are no rules. I became so tightly drawn in by these characters, that I forgot what the hell the cop was doing there to begin with! You'll find no good-guys, either, try as you might. I have never cheered so hard for the bad ones to win as I have in this movie. Lena Olin is just so rotten you'll look side-ways at your kids for the rest of your life.

Another point: Jack Grimaldi, Oldman's character, is the name of a famous circus clown; I wonder if that was intentional. The dreams, the Hole, Olin's insane laughter, the shots of the dead in the swimming pool and the FBI agents (""those Feds didn't come out too good..."") sprayed by DeMarkoff sprawled in the bloodstained room as the light fixture swings back and forth, Nick Gazzara's ""stank like a m*thaf***!

This film has a great plot, although it has used before (but how many original plots are there available?).  However, what is fresh is the dark exploration of the film's main character Jack.  The characters in this film are real.  In real life, many people do not grapple with the ""evil they do"".  Many never believe they are evil.  In this film, Jack only regrets being caught, or having bad luck.  He never learns, and I do not think he thinks he is ever a bad person.  In addition, the good guy does not win, nor is there a convenient tragedy to end the film.  Instead, reflecting life, the characters must live (or die) drenched in their imperfections.

They  think this is a main  stream movie,  a little legerdemain over an unsuspecting and gullible  audience, a clever approach to psuedo-noir, a psychological  thriller.
Missing a key element? Throw in lots of off-color language and  yelling to replace lack of story, or lack clever dialogue, or lack of plot.  Seems I've seen this somewhere before, `Roadhouse'? Are you listening  Hillary?
Could you turn up that jazz a bit?
This is not Pleasantville,  or even Cop Land..........it's strictly Amateur City.",956793600,6,1141,4.839378238341969
561458,5,6303102239,"This movie is absolutely captivating! The characters are seedy, but the plot is excellent. Lena Olin is one best actresses I have seen in a long time who can truly play a super wicked part. She is so increadably  convincing & excellent. This movie will end making you say  ""wow"". It wasn't a very popular movie, but it is a good one. Gary  Oldman is excellent too. He plays a good corrupted cop who eventually ends  up alone. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should make a point to . There  is a lot of violence, but that is part of the story I recommend this movie  highly!",954201600,8,575,4.277777777777778
561459,5,6303102239,"What this great film shows is how much some viewers THINK they know about noir-cinema but how little they really do. This film is one of the few that'll make you say Wow! when you just finish it. Not only because of  Olin, Gary Oldman makes his part so well that it's almost impossible to  imagine somebody else in it. This is really one of the best and most  interesting pieces of film noir (which means getting deep down the darkest  human feelings and being able to show it on the screen) and that you'll be  able to see in a long time. To compare it with such an overrated piece of  parafernalia like Pulp Fiction is to show how little you understood or what  a small number of noir films you have seen. Rent it, watch it, own it  -you'll thank Mr. Medak for it.",952819200,18,766,4.198630136986301
561460,3,6303102239,"Outrageous, energetic, but flawed.  The only thing that really stands out in this picture is Lena Olin's wild and brutal femme fatale role.  The movie is outrageous and energetic only with her presence, which made up for  the movie's odvious  attempt to become another ""Last Seduction"".  I would watch this movie just to see Olin go buckwild on Oldman's  character!  Other than that, If you want to see a good movie of this genre,  I suggest Pulp Fiction.",951868800,2,455,4.743589743589744

It is about time a film was made that dipicted a woman in touch with her masculine side and still be very  feminine.  I'm trying desperately to find this movie to add to my  collection. Everything about this film was great! It is a must see!",940291200,12,348,4.639344262295082
561462,5,6303102239,"Mark Isham's sexy score sucks you in and Lena Olin's sadistic psychopath knocks you out.  Way out!  Most fascinating, though, are the unusual roles of the male and female characters.  Women are portrayed as strong  (Annabella Sciorria as Gary Oldman's longsuffering wife) and brutal (Olin),  while poor Romeo is but a spineless, greedy little skirt chaser with  delusions of grandeur...until Mona DeMarkov (Olin) sinks her claws into  him.  DeMarkov is the most fascinating, most dangerous character in the  history of cinema.  Bar none.  To paraphrase Shakespeare, she out-Iago's  Iago.  A stunning achievement, but not one for timid viewers.",932601600,6,643,5.438775510204081
