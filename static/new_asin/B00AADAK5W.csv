5405124,2,B00AADAK5W,"Gary (Dallas Roberts) has a hobby. He kidnaps prostitutes and impregnates them. He also kills a ""pre-op transgender prostitute."" (The best surprise is no surprise.) Mike Fletcher (John Cusack) and Kelsey Walker (Jennifer Carpenter) are two Buffalo detectives assigned to find the missing girls. This is not a who-dun-it. We see the culprit. The first part of the film establishes character and dysfunctional relationships. When Abby (Mae Whitman), Mike's prostitute looking daughter, becomes the latest missing victim, Mike crosses the line to find her.

First off, I love John Cusack, but he is no Liam Neeson. This doesn't have the action level or intensity of ""Taken"", or even ""Taken 2."" We watch as Mike tries to locate his daughter as well as we see his daughter being ""cared for,"" so there is no feel of urgency for the audience as there is for Mike who is trying to piece things together. There is also a flashback sequence that pops up from time to time. This ties to a twist which made the film er, um...silly.

The movie is a ""B"" grade crime/drama/thriller. Might work as a rental. Soundtrack played ""Shuffle off to Buffalo"" for no apparent reason other than the fact it has the word ""Buffalo"" in it. Fairly lame.

5405140,3,B00AADAK5W,"It's kind of a 'Silence of the Lambs', with a dab of 'Payback' meets the real life stories of several abduction victims (possibly a bit exploitative). If you terrify easily, this film is not for you. Well-acted, but the screenplay lacks polish. It's trite, but could have been kind of acceptable with a few tweaks. Screenplay had ZERO consultation from police, I think it's fair to say. There is a pivotal scene where the cop's (Cusack) daughter is portrayed as too blatantly stupid. A very small change in the degree of recklessness shown would have added more cred to the story and more sympathy for the character. Another small mess-up that is emblematic of the lack of thoughtfulness in the writing, has to do with poor investigation technique where the detectives don't actually investigate a witness statement, they accept her opinion as fact instead of easily checking her assertion. It would not have taken more time or cost more money to shoot it more responsibly. Things get a little worse at the end. I have no theoretical problem with the crazy twist, BUT it is done really lame. Not a lot of effort would have had to go into a re-write to make it kind of workable. I feel bad for Cusack. I mean he got paid, but this kind of film can hurt your status. HIS performance is fine, and contributes significantly to making the film watchable. It's the writing that stinks.",1448409600,5,1379,4.679012345679013

5405142,4,B00AADAK5W,"This is a better movie then some of reviewers have given it credit. In fact, it's actually a tense movie.

John Cusack plays Mike, a Buffalo detective fixated on solving a missing hookers' case.  Carl A. Jamaux, the primary suspect in these missing hooker cases, inadvertantly picks up Mike's daughter thinking she was just another girl.  He was involved with more than just a few missing girls.

5405143,3,B00AADAK5W,"First, I saw this free during my first month on Netflix. Two, the movie is intense but . . . . The ending is preposperous and unbelievable.
While loosely based on a true crim that took place near New York, the film's makers take libertyies and make a mess of a solid thriller. The villain, overplayed by Dallas Roberts seems to dumb to carry off his heinous crimes against prostitutes,  John Cusack plays Det. Mike Fletcher, a cop fixated on solving the abduction and disappearance of several prostitutes. Cusack carries the film but his work is oversgadowed by a rdiculous ending. Also, the actress plauing his daughter is badly cast although she does try to be believable. It is overly graphic and only good entertaiunment. i cannot recommend this to critical thriller fans,",1438387200,,776,4.834586466165414

5405157,2,B00AADAK5W,"Even by the standards of serial killer/abduction movies this ones pretty unsavory both in content and presentation. A bit like a Law & Order episode through darker, slower, less comprehensible and certainly more graphic. Weve seen this type of material elsewhere, and done better. To make matters worse the twist at the end didn't work, at least not for me.
Even though he more or less carries the movie and does a good job, this role is quite a comedown for an actor of John Cusaks caliber. The credits say Factory was filmed in Montreal but the city where the story takes place, Buffalo, is depicted as a cold, windy, urban hell. I rate the film two stars instead of one, if only for a certain perverse fascination with the snow and the quirky, otherwise darker-than-dark visuals.",1426464000,,782,4.7153284671532845

5405179,3,B00AADAK5W,"It was average fair.  Cusack did an adequate job, but his character seemed more brooding than obsessed with the case.  Thin story line about a cop tracking a series of disappearances of prostitutes with very little to go on, then his daughter gets snatched.  Stupid plot twist at the end to standard storyline.  The director throws in a bunch of flashbacks to substantiate his finale, no one would ever pick them up as hints.

5405197,2,B00AADAK5W,"In The Factory John Cusack plays Mike Fletcher, a Buffalo police detective whose daughter Abby (Mae Whitman) goes missing one night. Apparently she is abducted by the same person responsible for the unsolved serial kidnapping case in the town. Inspired by actual events, The Factory attempts to be a suspenseful psychological thriller, but ends up with a rather elaborate and silly one.

The biggest problem of The Factory is the lack of emotional connection to the leading character and his family. John Cusack does what he can do here, but for all the anger and pain the talented actor expresses, Cusacks character Mike seems rather emotionally detached. We do not know much about his family; we do not really know about Abby except that she wants to meet her boyfriend.

Mike works with his partner Kelsey Walker (Jennifer Carpenter), but we are not very interested in their investigations. We are not allowed to know much about the missing women. We know who the antagonist is in the first five minutes (his name is Gary, reference to the real-life crime upon which the film is loosely based). There is no credible description about the father-daughter relationship. Mikes investigation is often interrupted by another storyline about what happened to his daughter Abby. The narrative constantly switches back and forth between two storylines rather mechanically, without raising tension. This is something that is pretty underwhelming.

As to the conclusion, all I can say is that director Morgan O'Neill tries too hard to impress. It is incredible and this is not a compliment.",1391040000,,1583,5.104247104247104

5405199,4,B00AADAK5W,"I'm not sure why people are complaining about anything in this movie.  Everything was well-done.  The acting is superb.  The serial killer is believable.  The tracking down of this maniac is logical.  It is a solid story with a few twists and turns that keep you eager to watch more.

The ending is an epic upheaval.  Very different.  Very cool.  Finally someone has the guts to try something new and unsettling.  You won't see it coming.  On that note, to be fair, you will either love the end or hate it probably.

Either way, this is a well-written story with excellent performances all around.  At least give it a rent.  It is a fun, creepy movie that resonates as a surprisingly realistic portrayal of detectives and the monsters they hunt..",1388793600,,746,4.638461538461539

5405201,2,B00AADAK5W,"At a certain point about halfway in, John Cusack's character has what would in most movies be all the information he needs to catch the murderer here. But, for no clear reason other then to extend the plotline, we dither away for another 45 minutes wondering why he doesn't.
Like a lot of ""Seven"" wannabes this movie suffers from a lack of both the intelligence and guts that made that film so emulated. Not a lot of depth here, not enough gore to satisfy the horror fans and, as noted, the ""mystery"" is pathetic.
The first half of John Cusack's career made him a favorite of mine and, clearly, he has the chops to be a great. I don't know if it was bad choices, bad luck, or what but it's a shame to see him wasting his talent in sub par vehicles like this.",1383264000,,758,4.23448275862069
5405202,1,B00AADAK5W,"Morgan O'Neill is Writer / Director of this sham. In an age of Breaking Bad, in which the writers at least ATTEMPT to mimic how cops really speak and act, we have this failure who tries to convince us that Cusack's character, an 18-year veteran on the force, would speak and behave the way he does.

Since O'Neil is Australian, he might take some time to read some non-fiction written by American ex-cops, or do SOMETHING before embarrassing himself and others with this kind of TRIPE. He could also use help as a director, as Jennifer Carpenter looks like a PTA mom trying to be tough, and the kidnapped daughter looks like a fat 12-year-old boy.
There is absolutely nothing about this movie that isn't poorly directed or written. Cusack is more than passable giving the laughable lines and behavior of his character. It always amazes me that in this day and age (of sophisticated, gritty, intelligent cop/crime movies), investors would pour millions into something as limp as this.",1381795200,2,983,4.816568047337278
5405203,4,B00AADAK5W,"This film was good, it kept me on the edge of my seat. I recommend this film to anyone who likes mystery  films and of coarse if you like John Cusack.",1377475200,,150,3.838709677419355
5405204,3,B00AADAK5W,"At the end of the opening scroll of the cast appears the blurb ""inspired by actual events."" I did a little checking and found that this film is apparently (loosely?) based on the story of Gary Heidnik, who was executed by the state of Pennsylvania in 1999. Heidnik was a serial killer who preyed on prostitutes and brutalized them in a manner similar to that depicted in this film.

In the film Dallas Roberts portrays Gary Gemaux, the Heidnik character. John Cusack plays Mike Fletcher, a police detective who became obsessed with solving the case. He had spent a lot of time trying to catch the killer during a three year stretch before the period covered by the film.

The film is more than a bit melodramatic. Figuratively speaking, as the conclusion approached, that train is roaring down the track, the damsel is tied to said track, and Detective Fletcher is galloping to the rescue. In the movie, the Heidnik settting is changed, for Fletcher is driving recklessly through the snow-covered streets of a late November in Buffalo.

I thought Cusack was solid and basically carried the film. I felt that the other characters were far less convincing.

There's a bizarre twist near the end that I did not see coming.  After this strange twist, the film gives us flashbacks of all the clues that we should have spotted.  Yep, the clues were there. Nope, I did not pick up on any of them.

The film did keep me engaged, but I cannot give it a strong recommendation.",1377302400,16,1466,4.658914728682171

The director is embarrassed enough about it that he puts in a whole montage of the clues you should have noticed, but probably didn't.

#2- Other reviewers raved about the ""twist ending"", and I kept hoping that would make up for the rest of the movie.

  Cusack did as fine a job as could be done with this limp script. Can't really imagine anyone else doing any better.

  As for the ""twist""... well, for me there was no twist. I spent most of the movie dismissing character lines & other hints that seemed to be obviously leading to a specific conclusion- the wrong conclusion, of course, to make the twist at the end more surprising. Turns out the hints were in fact tells: the script and direction really were THAT transparent. Very disappointing. On the plus side, there is relatively little violence/gore shown on screen, and Dallas Roberts had me convinced that he really was a very damaged, creepy, deranged psychopath.

While I'm not personally a huge fan of Cusack's acting style, he and all the others play their parts pretty decently. It may not be the sort of thing that one normally watches for the scenery, but the cinematography is far and away the best aspect of this film: Really fine camera work, with bleakly arresting footage of Buffalo, NY, and various other areas.

5405235,2,B00AADAK5W,"The Factory is currently on Netflix and I can only say I'm happy I didn't pay for it. Set in Buffalo, NY - which must have one of the worst police departments in history according to this film - it's a miserable tale of abducted prostitutes and the obsessive cop who tries to track them down. Apart from the cliche of the obsessive cop, needless to say his daughter also gets abducted by the same guy. Jennifer Carpenter plays Debra Morgan and is likely to get typecast in this role forever.

It's a dark movie that's almost too dark for its own good, where the clues generally don't lead anywhere and eventually the way the killer is found is ridiculous. There's a twist at the end which is one of the most absurd I've seen in a long time (they spice it up with flashbacks of the hints like they're remaking the ending of The Sixth Sense). None of the cops knows how to call for back up and amid the abduction, sexual abuse and general aura of violence, there's a fat guy who gets called fat is about half of his scenes.

After nearly two hours of this, you'll feel like you need a shower. It's a rehash of everything we've seen before and has some uncomfortable parallels with the true story of the three women kidnapped in Ohio. John Cusack phones in his performance and there's really not much exciting about that.",1369008000,9,1318,4.397540983606557

5405244,4,B00AADAK5W,"Crime dramas that are based on a true story are always the best kind of crime dramas, because it really is impossible to make up some of the bizzare things that go on inside the criminal mind. The Factory follows the investigation into the disappearance of prostitutes in Buffalo, New York, that takes a personal turn when one of the detectives daughters is abducted. John Cusack plays the lead detective and is terrific as always, this guy is so intense in everything that he does, from a dark crime drama like this to a comedy like Hot Tub Time Machine, Cusack always puts it all on the line and the viewers really do appreciate it. He's paired with a young, beautiful partner played by Jennifer Carpenter who feeds off the veteran actor to give a strong performance herself. This movie was a textbook crime drama, that followed both the investigation into the suspect, as well as the activities of the suspect. It was a tremendous story, but what I didn't like is that you knew exactly who the suspect was and where he worked right from the beginning of the film, there was no mystery too it, but the writer makes up for that with a twist in the end that I promise you won't see coming. The twist is jaw dropping and probably right from the true story, but for me, it kind of ruined the film. The Factory was great up until that point, and while I was shocked over what happened, it wasn't exactly what I wanted to see happen. Sometimes you don't know what's going to happen, but you have in your mind the way you want the story to end, and when the film all of a sudden goes in a completely different direction at the very end, you start to wonder if you didn't see it sooner, because it just wasn't written well enough. It's a very cool movie, albeit a little creepy.

one of the worst three movies i've ever seen--utterly unbelievable. i kept watching thinking something was going to happen. and then the story--if you can call it that--imploded and opted for a fantastically thoughtless and improbable non-sequitar of an ending.

i can't stand john cusack, but he wasn't really even in this--a cardboard cut-out of him was. and some other cut-outs, too, and they all shouted and posed in situations drafted by what i can only assume were invertebrates unfamiliar with human emotions, actions and motivations.

It's a thrill ride that kept me interested and as a gal with ADD, that's a sincere compliment. It may not have won any Oscars, but the story was tight, it was thrilling, and it left a bit of an after burn. John Cusack is just brilliant.

The twist at the end caught me off guard which is rare in hollywood films these days. And that ending is also VERY likely to have stopped this film from getting a wide release. I liked it alot and the twist I liked alot. I will not get in to any details to avoid spoilers but know this... many hollywood films actually write and sometimes shoot multiple endings to a movie. Almost always the ""happy"" ending is chosen to be released often due to pressure from the studios and producers. This film... this film did not change its story to make hollywood backers happy and thus its straight to video.

5405289,4,B00AADAK5W,"I just finished watching The Factory, a 2012 movie that was done back in 2007, but according to some, just sit on the shelf for all those years.  Not sure if it did or not, but I can believe it when I see some of the stars and then check out their ages.  Of course looks in a movie can be deceiving.  This is movie is about a nut job played by Dallas Roberts (The Walking Dead) who kidnaps young women so he can impregnate them to start a family.  Been there, seen that, you are probably saying, but still worth watching.  He is being chased by a police officer played by John Cusack and his partner played by Jennifer Carpenter who also played Emily Rose in The Exorcism of Emily Rose  and is also in Dexter.  John's wife is played by Sonya Walger who played Sally Harper in the American version of Coupling back in 2003, which by the way sucked when compared to the outstanding BBC version.  She was also in Lost.  John's daughter is played by Mae Whitman and she just happens to get herself kidnapped by the very person her father is looking for.  She was also in The Perks of Being A Wallflower.  When she is kidnapped, she ends up in the basement with two other young girls, one played by Katherine Waterson who appeared in The Babysitters back in 2007.  The other is Mageina Tovah who appeared in American Horror Story and Scandal.  During his investigation, John goes to see a hooker played by none other than the beautiful Ksenia Solo who plays Kenzi in the hit series Lost Girl.  Unfortunately, her part is much too short, but well done and she is blonde unlike Kenzi who has dark hair.  Cindy Sampson plays an undercover cop posing as a hooker.  She had a much bigger part in the series Supernatural, but she does a great job with what she has to work with.  This show has been rated low by some and a bit higher by others, but not being a film critic, I would give it a passing grade.  I look to see if it has people I like, a decent story, and can it hold my attention for 90 plus minutes and this one did that.  Also, it does have a surprise ending, which was not at all what I expected.  I give it a 7.5 out of 10 rating.

5405347,3,B00AADAK5W,"John Cusack and Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) play Buffalo Police detectives who have been investigating a string missing prostitutes.  Mike Fletcher (Cusack) believes they are dealing with a serial killer but none of the bodies have ever been found.  However after several years of no new leads the investigation has grown cold and is about to be shut down.  That is until another young girl disappears to make the investigation personal for Fletcher when his own teenage daughter Abby comes up missing.

As Mike and Kelsey Walker (Carpenter) desperately chase down every lead possible, Abby finds herself trapped with several other young women in the basement dungeon of a psychopath named Gary who turns his captives into his own cult-like family.  He forces them to have sex with him so they can give him children, keeping them drugged and brainwashed into calling him ""Daddy"".

Gary is played by Dallas Roberts who most people know from The Walking Dead as the scientist Milton Mamet who works with the Governor.  Roberts' performance is sneaky effective, hitting just the right notes of Manson-like craziness yet still maintaining enough poise to keep his cover as a food service worker in a nearby hospital.  Cusack is normally known for lighter roles but does a nice job here as a cop who is obsessed with finding the psychopath even before his daughter went missing.  Carpenter plays a toned down, less bombastic version of her character of Debra Morgan from Dexter.  Only Mae Whitman as Abby seems to be in a little over her head although she's a veteran young actress who has been around for nearly 20 years.

The Factory was shot in 2011 but never received a theatrical release.  Probably a good thing; It's a fine film but definitely more of a direct-to-video film than worthy of a theatrical release.

5405369,1,B00AADAK5W,"I am actually pissed after wasting two hours watching this movie. It is just nonsense.

5405370,4,B00AADAK5W,good thriller - takes an unexpected turn and keeps you guessing until the very end of the movie.... would recommend,1361491200,9,115,4.8
5405371,2,B00AADAK5W,"As I have stated in other film reviews, when a realistic movie (not fantasy, not sci fi) presents me with a turn in the plot I can't possibly believe would occur, I write the film off as a piece of poorly-written trash going for cheap thrills instead of well-constructed story. Films like this one seem to imply that audiences should NOT expect a movie to present a credible plotline. The ending was spectacularly disappointing, completely implausible, and obviously concocted by an idiot. Although other reviewers have spilled some beans, I won't go into details: suffice it to say that it is such a coincidence that Cusack's partner just happens to be, er, intimately involved in this case. Talk about diabolus ex machina...

Cusack, I still love you man, but you makin some stinkers!!!!!",1361491200,8,790,4.93984962406015
5405372,1,B00AADAK5W,"Poor guy, that Cusack. Lately, he's been throwing down some real stinkers, and this doesn't stray from that path at all. It's a Dark Castle production, so you can be sure it'll be as deep as a puddle in a desert, and John Cusack is just awful in an already-awful film. If you're looking for a movie of this type, just watch Se7en again, or see the film Anamorph, which had very little fanfare but was much better than its box office might indicate.

Again, skip this movie. Your time is precious and limited on this Earth.",1360627200,5,522,4.381443298969073
5405373,3,B00AADAK5W,"""I'm doing you a favor, I'm doing everyone a favor."" Mike Fletcher (Cusack) is a cop who has been looking for a serial killer (Roberts) for a long time with no luck. He and his partner are doing everything they can until his daughter winds up missing. Then it becomes personal and Fletcher will stop at nothing to find her. This is a movie that is hard to review. The acting is actually very good in this, Dallas Roberts is especially creepy. The big problem is that the movie feels jerky, for ten minutes you are really interested and excited, then twenty minutes of repetition that makes you lose interest, then it picks back up then slows down. I have said before that many movies work better as TV shows, this is a perfect example of that. For Cusak to be in a movie like this it surprises me. The movie is pretty generic but the acting helps to make it better then it really is. Overall, should have been a TV show instead of a movie. I give it a B- only because of the twist I didn't see coming.",1360368000,6,1001,4.2460732984293195
5405374,4,B00AADAK5W,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie, it's already available here in Australia, it's different, love John Cusack, the story is familiar and while it does not have the intensity of Taken, it holds it's own as a thriller/crime film, with a great ending, loosely based on a true story, it's much better then the ratings it got, great car stunts as well.",1356739200,2,353,4.53125
8549115,4,B00AADAK5W,"John Cusack is a cop in this 2012 film whose daughter and other females were abducted by some unknown man. He is passionately obsessed to find the abductor and save his daughter and others, as well as any future women the abductor kidnaps. He is stymied repeatedly for reasons he is unable to understand.
The film is filled with violence and it is very suspenseful. What the abductor does is very brutal. His plans are bizarre, and his behavior is weird. The film has a surprise ending. Viewers who enjoy intense suspense will be thrilled with The Factory.",1528588800,,556,4.683673469387755
