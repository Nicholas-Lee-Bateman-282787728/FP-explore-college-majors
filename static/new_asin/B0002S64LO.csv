2117732,4,B0002S64LO,"I bought this 8-DVD set a couple years back from Best Buy and I really love it! The picture quality is great! The only thing's I didn't like were the unoriginal theme music and the logo on screen [as the last reviewer mentioned]. I noticed that other Bonanza DVD's that I've purchased [mainly 1 dollar DVD's] by 'Digiview productions' also have unoriginal theme music in them! I can't figure out why? Even a Dan Hernandez ""1 dollar"" Sport Fishing DVD that I purchased by Digiview Productions has the same exact unoriginal theme music as one of their Bonanza DVD's! Stupid!!!! But as far as this particular box-set goes...If you don't mind it not having the famous Bonanza theme song and the logo on the screen the whole time you're watching it, then I highly recommend this set for you!",1195084800,18,786,4.661870503597123
2117733,3,B0002S64LO,"Lovers of the original Bonanza will like these episodes. The video is good, the audio is loud & clear, you don't have to turn the volume up like other dvd's  but....

That wonderful theme music is missing both at the beginning & at the end - that cost this one star

BUT EVEN WORSE !!! ... (and costing another star)

The Platinum Video people must think it's OK to put their name and a logo in the bottom right of the screen. I DON'T !!!

I hate it on broadcast & cable TV and I wouldn't have bought this if I'd known about the logo.

Platinum Video in on my ""no buy list"" because of that logo policy.",1186531200,100,602,4.059322033898305

2117765,1,B0002S64LO,"Season 2 or what can watch was terrible, it appears to an after market copy. Each show had and R/E in the lower left. The music was total different, the sound was poor and at times broken, the color was washed out, and only 12 episodes were available. It was no where near the quality of season, not to mention there were over 30 available episodes in season 1",1481846400,,360,4.231884057971015

2117772,4,B0002S64LO,"I must admit I was a bit thrown off by the missing soundtrack from the original series.  The Bonanza theme is gone, and likely is because of a licensing issue (and expense involved).  However, the season itself is full of the family entertainment I remember as a child.  Sadly, then entire season is not currently available, just the first 18 episodes.  I hope the rest of the season will become available in the future.",1478390400,,420,4.635135135135135

I'm in my 40's, and I strongly believe we need more shows like this in today's world. The quality of today's programming leaves a lot to be desired, and isn't a very good example for young people. It's a great thing that we can still access this material on line.",1477958400,,354,4.461538461538462

If an episode begins with Ben meeting an old friend whom he has not seen in years, watch out for trouble.

2117929,4,B0002S64LO,I love the show but I am disappointed that you only have the second half of season one and the first half of season two available as prime. There are a couple of other issues as well. For some reason the Bonanza theme song has been replaced with a bad substitute (in season two) that is cringe worthy. Also some of the episodes have color distortions that are very annoying. The shows themselves are great.,1453507200,,406,4.426666666666667

Great episode because it features all the family and a unique twist--usually it is my favorite character Adam who is most suspicious of strangers, but in this case the suspicion is driven by Little Joe, believably so, as it blends naturally with his youngest child syndrome & tendency to focus on insignificant things like fleeting competition and hormones.

It features each Cartwright family member very well and imbues the caring, honorable traits of the Cartwright clan that endeared them to us all those years.  Ben Cooper does an excellent job of portraying the troubled drifter, Sam.",1374364800,,712,5.283185840707965

The features include on-air RCA promos (RCA owned NBC during Bonanza's network run) in selected episodes, and NBC logos before and after the opening and closing credits, just as originally broadcast over a half-century ago, a walk down memory lane. Other special features include audio commentary on selected episodes, and a few other extras worth watching. If you're a big fan of Bonanza, it's a fair price. If you're a big fan of nostalgia, it's a bargain. Let's hope that future releases of this great western series will have the same great features. And kudos to Amazon for the speedy delivery!

The two Official Seasons of Bonanza are vastly superior to the bargain unofficial conglomeration of episodes that are all in the public domain.  The picture is sharp and the restored color as vivid as it must have been when the episodes aired.  (My family only had a black-and-white TV in those days.)  The sound is also excellent and you get the iconic theme song as the four Cartwrights ride up and the map burns.  Finally, the episodes are uncut and significantly longer than today's one hour dramas.  The extras described in other reviews are a definite plus.

I had purchased the german dvds as the original music was on them, unlike all the other dvds of Bonanza circulating round the USA and found in dollar bins etc.

But these ""Official"" ones are well worth the price.  Firstly, for me, they have captioning, which is a boon for those with hearing losses and they naturally have the original music scores and are uncut.

But they also come with great extras!  There are still b&w pix from behind the scene shootings, there are publicity clips (a video of a Rose Bowl Parade appearance in the most recent), comments from the producer, Mr Dortort, voice overs from guest stars and stuntsmen etc with tidbits about the shows, the actors and the production.

In 2003 Platinum had 8 episodes without the original title music but again the picture was almost as good as this new set. Picture quality on these videos is sharper than it appears on TV broadcast not because of any restoration but simply because they aren't compressed for transmission. So yeah the picture quality is pretty good but then it always has been. The Best of Bonanza set by Artisan in 2003 only claimed to be digitally mastered(not restored or remastered) yet the video quality is almost as good as the new set. If the new set had been restored you wouldn't see the constant artifacts popping up as specks in the video. It isn't horribly distracting but its just proof that the video has not been restored. Any video that claims to be restored should look as good as new. As we've seen in numerous dvd releases of old films, it is possible to do.

2118205,4,B0002S64LO,"This is the First half of the second season of Bonanza and both the quality of the writing and the broadening of the characters has improved tremendously since the 1st season.  The themes have begun to show a little redundancy, however, a problem which arose for exactly the reason actor Pernell Roberts (Adam) suggested it would; if you don't allow the lives of the characters to follow a normal life trajectory, the number of situations that they can find themselves in becomes more limited.

For those of you who enjoyed Adam (of which I am one), there are two nice romances featuring him, ""The Hopefuls"" and ""The Savage,"" both a delight to watch.  Hoss features in a sad romance, ""The Courtship,"" which has him in love with a gambling addict, and Ben has a serious romantic encounter in ""The Mill,"" and a semi-comedic ""marriage"" in ""The Bride.""  As throughout the series, Little Joe has several romantic encounters, especially ""The Spitfire"" and ""Silent Thunder"" which give his character a little more of a serious weight than heretofore.

Dan Blocker's character, Hoss, is further developed as a compassionate man in ""The Last Viking,"" where he encounter's his mother's brother whom he has idolized since childhood and with whose actual history he has to come to terms, and ""The Ape,"" where he tries to intervene in the life of a man with problems similar to his own with sad consequences.

A more comedic episode, ""The Abduction"" has Hoss and Little Joe trying to find and rescue a rebellious female friend who has fallen prey to a pair of carnival workers bent on becoming wealthy by ransoming her back to her father, a silver mine magnet.  It works, but O'Henry's ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" and it's comic situations came immediately to mind and put this to shame, I'm afraid.  The comedic pairing of Dan Blocker and Michael Landon in the series is always a delight to watch, and here presages the combination that managed to carry the series itself through the elimination of Adam as part of the crew.

Wonderful entertainment.",1317340800,3,2035,4.824712643678161

The later, long-running, Laramie Peacock, which introduced an episode of Laramie on January 1, 1962, and still infrequently turns up on NBC after nearly a half-century, is more subdued by comparison. There are a bundle of extras, including commentary by guest actors, slide shows, interviews, and in several episodes, commercial bumpers not seen since their original network runs. CBS has left in the NBC production card at the close of each episode, followed by an appearance of the NBC snake (1959-1975), a line that snakes around into the letters N and B on top, and C below. Like the peacock, the snake is accompanied by an announcement that this program is a color broadcast. CBS really dotted their i's and crossed their t's with this Bonanza release of fine looking episodes.

I suppose this interview along with all the remaining David Dortort video will be doled out in eye dropper sized increments so as to last throughout as many seasonal volumes as possible!

2118220,5,B0002S64LO,"This long-awaited CBS Paramount DVD release of Season Two, Volume 1, executive produced by Andrew J. Klyde, is yet another quantum leap for the legendary series! The image and sound quality is excellent!

 Working from the original 35mm film elements (prints and magnetic soundtracks stored by NBC in Fort Lee, New Jersey), technicians remastered episodes on digital video (with
edits) in the late 80's.

 In 2009-2010, CBS in Studio City obtained the interpositives and audio tracks from NBC for DVD. The prints and soundtracks were taken to Hi-Def video and digital audio for the ultimate quality on DVD masters. The lowest amount of MPEG-2 compression was used for the cleanest image and it shows beautifully. No edits and complete and uncut.

 My best goes to Andrew Klyde, who lobbied for years to get the series out. His hard work got us great bonus contents and he wrote detailed liner notes (with film dates and locations), which we appreciate very much!

 The packaging is much improved since the first season. It's easier to detach DVDs from the flip-trays. Also, the episode titles and bonus contents are listed on every disc. Note: Season One didn't have this included; the fans complained and were heard!

 Fans know many of these episodes have cropped up on DVD sets in recent years because they fell into public domain and bootleg outfits who call themselves video distributors have been selling them since then. They are renegades who illegally acquired bad copies of the episodes and sell them for dirt-cheap prices. I'm talking about outfits such as Madacy, Brentwood, Mill Creek, Echobridge, etc. Do NOT buy from any of these crooks. Even the photos and names on these cheap DVDs are used without legal permission.

 NBC retains the original copyright for all 430 episodes of BONANZA but many of them from the first two years were not renewed in the copyright office in the mid-90's. This is how it started. To end it, simply buy the Official Seasons One & Two by CBS Paramount Home Entertainment!

 BONANZA was the single-most successful TV series of the 1960's and early 70's in the world. Spread the word -- be sure to check out CBS' BONANZA DVD page at FACEBOOK, talk to the managers at local retailers to carry BONANZA Official DVDs and so on!

 One more important fact is that CBS is not syndicating BONANZA for Hi-Def broadcasting because it's too costly. The CBS DVD sets are the ONLY way to experience BONANZA uncut and with magnificent picture and sound quality. So fans keep buying, and CBS will release future seasons.

 BONANZA: The Official Second Season, Volume 2 will be released on October 11, 2011!

Allow me to state without reservation: The ""official"" DVDs have been worth waiting for, and are definitely worth the price! The image quality is crystal clear; the spectacular scenery is even more breathtaking than ever and the colors are vibrant. Best of all - these eps are uncut. For those of us who missed the show's premiere seasons and have only seen them in reruns, it's like watching a whole new show. (And let's face it, even if you did see them in their original runs, it's been awhile since 1959, LOL.) Trust me, these official DVDs are like watching 'Bonanza' for the very first time. I am confident that 'Bonanza' - the greatest and best Western of all time - will continue to attract fans, even those who are discovering this treasure for the very first time. The timeless values are as relevant as ever (maybe even moreso). Bravo and eternal thanks to series creator David Dortort and the men who brought the Cartwrights so magnificently to life - Lorne Greene (Ben) - Pernell Roberts (Adam) - Dan Blocker (Hoss) - Michael Landon (Joe).",1294963200,8,1138,4.666666666666667

It was interesting how they explained where the episode was filmed and how they did the special effects. They all said the Bonanza stars were a pleasure to work with and everyone on the set was nice. David Dortort, the creator of Bonanza gave interesting interviews too. I especially liked his interview called ""Remembering Pernell Roberts"". The photo gallery contains photos of the stars at their homes. The episodes are uncut with scenes never seen before on TV.

2118230,2,B0002S64LO,"I haven't actually bought Bonanza Season 2 Volume 1 yet and it does not look like I will. I insist on excellent picture quality before buying a DVD and I always research the professional reviews on the Internet before buying. Most of the reviewers on Amazon who comment on how good the picture quality is on a DVD are well meaning but still amateur reviewers who don't know what a good video picture really looks like. In 10 minutes of researching I've already found 2 professional web sites (Home Theater Forum and DVD Talk) who say the picture quality on Season 2 Volume 1 isn't near as good as the Season 1 sets. As time goes by, more negative reviews will probably come in from other sites.

I own both the Season 1 sets of Bonanza and the picture quality was excellent. I'm sorry to hear that Season 2 does not appear to measure up. We shouldn't be surprised. Unfortunately, Bonanza is owned by CBS/Paramount, one of the most inconsistent video companies in the world. They have a long history of screwing up their vintage TV releases, from changing the music on The Fugitive to cutting out Jim Nabors's songs in Gomer Pyle. Thank God the CBS/Paramount dimwits at least had the brains to farm out the video production of the recent Blu Ray Twilight Zone TV releases to Image Entertainment who did a spectacular job. To bad Image didn't get the Bonanza contract.

I don't post a negative review to hurt the feelings of the Bonanza fans on Amazon. I'm a big Bonanza fan myself and want to see this classic TV show done right. But, all concerned fans have only one weapon to use against careless video companies like CBS; hit them in their pocketbook. If nobody complains, they will keep turning out mediocre DVD releases. If I can keep a few people from buying this new Bonanza release with my negative review and some other reviewers join me, maybe we can get CBS's attention. I doubt we can, but we still have to try.

2118231,5,B0002S64LO,"One Amazon reviewer has stated that the picture quality on this set isn't up to par with the previous dvd release of Bonanza.  This is only partially true, as three episodes (""The Hopefuls""; ""Denver McKee""; and ""The Trail Gang"") do not look as clear and sharp as the rest of the episodes found on Bonanza Season Two, Volume One.  This is most likely due to the condition of the original picture source materials and not anything CBS/Paramount has or hasn't done.  They all look to be remastered to the best possible quality.  Remember that this season was public domain for years and that damage does occur to even properly-stored video materials over time.  This is what I believe happened to those aforementioned episodes.  They are by no means unwatchable and still look considerably better than any other versions of these episodes I have seen.

On the whole, the majority of the episodes on this set look and sound great.  This is the best Bonanza will ever look and sound, all things considered.

Imagine my shock several months later when I inquired on a fan website and learned that NO quality DVD release was available in the States!  I was ready to pull the trigger on a full set of all seasons only to find out they were bogus (most likely recorded from television--yuck).  Needless to say, I'm thrilled to have the full episodes (without the chopped up versions running on tv), and I can't wait for more releases.  Problem is, they're coming FAR too slow!!  Please please, let's find a way to speed up the release of this fantastic show.

My favorite part of Second Season, Volume 1 is the commentary episodes.  What a treat to hear from the actual actors.  The never-before-seen photos are really wonderful.

Each of the four guest stars does an excellent job and they provide some interesting information about television programs in the 1960s as well as their memories of appearing on Bonanza.  I also want to mention the photos provided with almost every episode.  While some are publicity shots, others are candid photos of the four stars relaxing off camera together or with a guest star.

What are these miserable little people at Warner,Paramount,Universal and so on playing at. Alright you say,why not import it?.If I did it would cost god knows how much more,Import duty - V.A.T. - Post Office fees,so it would be quite expensive. So please please remember us across the Atlantic.",1286323200,8,819,4.857142857142857

8031384,1,B0002S64LO,"I bought episode 15 ""Bloodline"" and it's playing Episode 16 ""The Courtship"". I don't like the colors on this second season-earth tones. The opening music isn't the ""Bonanza"" song. It's some other ""western"" type of music. I'm VERY disappointed with this season-especially having spent $1.99 per video. I know it's FREE with Amazon Prime but I don't have that. What a waste!!!! Can't contact Amazon personally, either!",1487894400,,416,5.223880597014926
