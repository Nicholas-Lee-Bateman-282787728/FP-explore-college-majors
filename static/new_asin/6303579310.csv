Spoilers

1.[US TITLE]STING VS MENG-a rematch for the US title from the previous PPV. This was a good match on Stings home turf. Good back and forth with Sting of course retaining, of course it is easy to say that in hindsight. Good opening bout.

2.[TV TITLE]THE RENEGADE VS PAUL ORNDORFF-WCWs Warrior before they got Warrior defended his TV title here against a legend. This match was the worst on the card and I hate saying that since Orndorff was involved. Renegade controls most of the match and keeps the belt. But the thing that struck me was how much the crowd was for anything Orndorff and couldn't have cared less about Renegades offense.

3. JIM DUGGAN VS KAMALA-not the greatest match ever but not the worst on the card, still not too great. This of course is more of a brawl during the Dungeon of Dooms coming into being. Kamala was the first really to join Taskmaster. Of course the Zodiac would come in next and come down to knock Duggan out. Kamala gets the win here.

4. DDP VS DAVE SULLIVAN-we follow those up with a decent match continuing the feud over Kimberly and the rabbit of course. Dave looks good but it is DDP who pulls out the victory.

5.[TAG TITLE]HARLEM HEAT VS THE NASTY BOYS VS THE BLUE BLOODS-I enjoyed this match and like all three teams involved. They had all been feuding for a while leading into this so the three way made sense. Good action throughout from all three teams. The ending is a little off but I kinda liked it especially since it was Harlem Heat that would win.

6.[LIFEGUARD MATCH]RANDY SAVAGE VS RIC FLAIR-this was a lumberjack match but for obvious reasons it was changed to a lifeguard match. This was the continuance of one of the greatest feuds in wrestling history. Sure this was not their best match but I really enjoyed it. My favorite of the card of course with the Macho man getting the win [which seemed rare in WCW for some reason]. I also loved that he took a sweet DDT from Arn Anderson and still won with that excellent flying elbow drop from the top rope.

7.[STEEL CAGE WCW TITLE MATCH]HULK HOGAN VS VADER-the feud that could have really made Vader even bigger. In my opinion he should have won this feud like the beast he was. Of course behind the scenes Hogan could not let that happen. That lead to this feud feeling a little like a letdown for me but still I did in all honesty enjoy their matches for the most part. Hogans boy Rodman came down to ringside for this match. This was an entertaining match but it basically was really putting Hogan over as a monster killer, especially towards the end. Hulk escapes the cage to retain the strap.

Not on one of the best events WCW had but I love Macho Man so I had to have it.",1464998400,,2723,4.397614314115308
7852253,2,6303579310,"LIKE MANY OF THE WCW PAY-PER-VIEWS, THIS IS PRETTY BAD AT TIMES. BUT, I HAVE SEEN MUCH WORSE [FOR EXAMPLE, UNCENSORED '95]. HERE'S MY OPINIONS ON THESE MATCHES;

1. FOR THE WCW U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION STING VS. MENG

YOUR AVERAGE WCW MATCH. SLOW MOVING AND BORING. I'M A BIG FAN OF STING AND I THINK HE SHOULD'VE DONE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THIS. RATING; 2/5

2. FOR THE WCW TV CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION THE RENEGADE VS. PAUL ORNDORFF

HORRIBLE. THE MATCH JUST SUCKS. THE RENEGADE WAS JUST WCW'S VERSION OF THE WWE'S ULTIMATE WARRIOR. SKIP THIS. RATING; 1/5

3. KAMALA VS. HACKSAW JIM DUGGAN

AN UNWATCHABLE MATCH THAT FEATURES TWO WRESTLERS THAT'RE ALL GIMMICK AND ALMOST NO WRESTLING TALENT. RATING; 0/5

4. DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE VS. DAVE SULLIVAN

YET ANOTHER BAD MATCH. ONLY GOOD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO WATCH A MATCH FROM THE EARLIER DAYS OF DDP'S CAREER. RATING; 1/5

5. 3 WAY MATCH FOR THE WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS

CHAMPIONS HARLEM HEAT [BOOKER T & STEVIE RAY] VS. THE NASTY BOYS [BRIAN KNOBS & JERRY SAGS] VS. THE BLUE BLOODS [LORD STEVEN REGAL & BOBBY EATON, I THINK]

ONE OF THE BETTER MATCHES ON THIS EVENT. IT WAS OK. RATING; 3/5

6. LUMBERJACK MATCH

RANDY SAVAGE VS. RIC FLAIR

THE BEST MATCH ON THE EVENT. THIS MATCH SAVES THE EVENT FROM BEING A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. RATING; 4/5

7. STEEL CAGE MATCH FOR THE WCW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION HULK HOGAN VS. VADER

PREDICTABLE AND BORING. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER LACKLUSTER WCW PPV MAIN EVENT. RATING; 2/5

AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, ANOTHER FORGETTABLE WCW PAY-PER-VIEW. OH, AND A TAG TEAM MATCH BETWEEN BUNKHOUSE BUCK & DICK SLATER AND ALEX WRIGHT & MARCUS ALEXANDER BAGWELL AKA BUFF BAGWELL IS MISSING. BUT, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIKE THIS EVENT, I STILL CHERISH THIS TAPE, BEING THAT WCW IS OUT OF BUSINESS TODAY. ONLY WORTH GETTING IF YOU'RE COLLECTING WCW TAPES FOR VALUE.",1091923200,3,1842,4.661490683229814

7852255,5,6303579310,The matches were Decent but the main event needed more  Excitement. Match of the day was Savage and Flair.,998352000,,106,4.578947368421052
7852256,2,6303579310,"Watching this tape now after everything in WCW is all said and done, it is kind of fascinating. This was the pre-Monday Nitro and pre-NWO WCW here with Hulk Hogan. It is kinda fun, but the whole event could have been so much better considering the talent involved! There are some truly lackluster matches here by todays wrestling standards! Well, this was WCW's style in 1995.
Sting has on OK match with Meng. Sting is a good wrestler, but Meng is not. This match kicked off the show and it was slow and not really any high spots. The matches that fallow are of varing quality, but most of the matches are slow-paced and not very exciting. The best matches were the two main events, I thought. Savage vs. Ric Flair was fun and even Hogan vs. Vader was ok, but not great. The fun parts are all the interviews and the clips of various happenings in WCW at the time.
If you must buy this, try to find a used copy like I did. Otherwise this is a decent time killing rental.",987811200,,969,4.300546448087432
7852257,3,6303579310,"If you want to see the way non-wwf wrestling was in 1995, this is the video to do so with. The card was decent and clips of WCW's various shows of the time are shown. This video is from the small period of time in which  Hulk Hogan was in WCW, but before the Nitro era.",951264000,,269,3.8035714285714284
7852258,4,6303579310,"i saw this on pay-per-view back in 95 and tought it was good. The first match, sting vs. meng and was pretty god. the tag-team match between the blue bloods vs. nasty boys vs. harlem heat was good, but they should have  had heat lose the tag titles. The main event cage match betwwen hogan and  vader was ok but could have been better. what was the point of rodman at  the ringside and the dungeon of doom coming down but not doing anythin.",921369600,,440,4.214285714285714
