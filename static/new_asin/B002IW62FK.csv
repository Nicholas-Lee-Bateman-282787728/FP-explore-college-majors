Along the way the Doctor encounters an old friend, says goodbye to another and has the chance to win enlightenment.
  Now that part is out of the way this is one of the best special feature loaded set to date.  Each episode has the standard commentary by the actors and producers, behind the scenes of the episodes footage from various shows related to that episode.  Oneof my favorites is new cgi effects.  This was the one set of Peter Davidson stories that needed them the most.  Also an additonal disc with a better cut of enlightenment along with new cgi that makes the episode so much better.

3937486,5,B002IW62FK,"For those whose memories of Dr. Who are cheap, often laughable special effects, even for the post-Star Wars age of the 1980's, the Restoration Team has solved that by giving you the option to watch each of the episodes with modern CGI effects.  The results are stunning--especially in ""Terminus"" and ""Enlightenment""; the latter receives a much deserved full makeover. All three stories are engaging and the cheap looking f/x no longer detract from the great writing and acting.  Most seem to laud ""Mawdryn Undead"" as the best, due in part to the inventive time displacement conceit and the return of the Brigadier. ""Enlightment"" is by far the best of the three, though. Not only does it boast an imaginative story (a race in space on sailing boats), but it carries a mysterious (if not brooding) atmosphere the others lack, largely because the music is spot-on and the excellent sets and costumes are not severely over-lit (as Peter Davison notes repeatedly in the commentary).",1262304000,,977,4.987730061349693

3937488,4,B002IW62FK,"In a way, it's a bit of an overstatement to call the three stories included in this set a trilogy, for each is very distinct in both style and substance. Thankfully so, since variety is the spice of life. Linking the three ever so loosely though is the introduction of Turlough and his Faustian bargain with the Black Guardian, a cosmic being with a grudge against the Doctor. In a way, saddling the Doctor with a ""rubbish"" companion (well before Adam in 2005's ""Dalek"" & ""The Long Game"") is an inventively risky idea, and having a thoroughly unpleasant and devious character among the Tardis crew adds a suspenseful twist to the stories on the one hand, while on the other it often devolves into Turlough repetitively stepping not quite but almost out of earshot and hissing into a glowing crystal for instructions from his erstwhile Mephistopheles. Be that as it may, something beyond the bounds of the tried and true is laudably being attempted here. The trilogy as a whole also happens to transpire roughly during the middle of Peter Davison's tenure as the Fifth Doctor, a moment when his approach to the character seems to have become comfortably established while still retaining some of its initial freshness. On that score, then, these three stories amply demonstrate in both their significant strengths and minor pitfalls a good deal of what ""Doctor Who"" was capable of in 1983.

""Mawdryn Undead"" is a particularly strong story that unusually makes the most of the potential for time paradox in the show's premise and even more unusually features an antagonist whose ambition is not to conquer nor destroy but to die. The reappearance of the Brigadier along with other references to the show's history are rather skillfully woven into the plot, although the resolution is a bit of a let-down, taking place not through the Doctor's own cleverness nor even the bravery of his companions past and present but limply through a credulity-straining coincidence. Likewise straining one's credulity in ""Terminus"" is the idea that a load of starship fuel could set off a chain reaction destroying not just a planet, a solar system, or even a galaxy, but the entire universe (!). One can't help but suspect that the writer's concept of cosmology and its scale is a bit uninformed. That said, the story deftly balances the grim imagery of drudgery and disease with resonant mythological motifs while confronting the contradictions between the profit motive and medical care in a way that coincidentally seems unusually relevant more than two decades later. Finally, ""Enlightenment"" is the real gem of this trilogy. There is something indescribably eerie about it. And yet it's also just an incredibly well-written science fiction tale juxtaposing impeccable expertise in historical detail with an utterly surreal context. The tone can pitch dramatically in range from hauntingly mysterious, boisterously campy, firmly moralistic, and strangely romantic--and yet the tale as a whole, while marred a bit here and there by some overacting, holds together wonderfully and verges on the profound without losing its sense of fun and adventure.

Come to think of it, then, on a deeper level certain rather weighty themes do in fact run through these three stories after all: temptation and redemption, death and regeneration, time and eternity, order and chaos, not to mention the unsuitability of dead birds as headgear.",1258761600,3,3413,5.0928571428571425

3937490,5,B002IW62FK,"The Fifth Doctor deserves more recognition!!!  There, I've said it.  Coming after the immensely popular Tom Baker, Peter always seems to get the short end of the stick.  Everyone talks about Tom, and Collin's portrayal is a lightning rod for conversation.  Peter did some wonderful episodes, and this storyline is among his best.  No, it isn't up there with Kinda(one of my favorite episodes), but this is well worth the investment of time and money.  The Guardian is such an interesting character, introduced during Baker's tenure and reintroduced here.  The first and last episodes really shine.  Just well plotted and acted.  Torlough is a vastly underrated character, and here he is at his best.  Just a really fun ride, full of Whovian turns that will captivate you and your kids.  This one is great Sunday family time.

3937491,5,B002IW62FK,"I am sure many fans of the clasic series were hoping these three episodes would be released together and sure enough the Doctor Who Restoration Team did not disapoint us. The three episodes in the box set hail from Doctor Who's 20th aniversary Season (5th Doctor Peter Davison's 2nd season). While that season seemed a bit dis-jointed at times it did have one of those ""moments"" that reminded you why you loved Doctor Who in the First place. I am of course talking about the real ""Gem"" of this box set...Mawdryn Undead. This episode is so cleverly executed from start to finish. The writing,  the direction and the acting are all top shelf! The story revolves around a group of alien immortals deperatly trying to escape the curse of immortality. The doctor is flung into the middle of their struggle by the bent on revenge ""Black Gaurdian"" and his emotionaly twisted and unwilling assassan Turlough (sounds like ter-low). The Doctor is aided in this episode by the returning Brigadere Lethbridge Stewart who is now retired from UNIT and teaching at an all boys school. This is truly the Brigadere's finest hour in the program's history as Nicholas Courtney returns to the role and plays the aging veteran to perfection. The episode also features a brilliant plot twist that has the doctors companions Tegan and Nyssa sent back in time some nine years or so and yet they are still able to aid the Doctor as events unfold. Other highlights are the brilliant set designs on Mawdryn's ship, the music score and a nice little ""flashback"" during episode two...But I'll say no more to protect first time viewers.
  The other two episodes in the box set, Terminus and Enlightenment, have their moments but fail to come up to the level of Mawdryn Undead. That being said this box set is worth every penny. If you have seen it buy it again and relive the magic of Mawdryn if for no other reason than to remeber how you felt after you viewed it for the First time ( I would imagine most Doctor Who Fan's can remember exactly where they were the first time they saw this episode.)If you have never seen Mawdryn Undead (and I envy you) buy it as well and enjoy One of Doctor Who's finest hours....or hour and a half.

They maybe released in the far future as digital downloads only or picked up by another company but that doesn't mean that all the special features will go with them.
For me this set is ALL ABOUT Mawdryn Undead which to me is one of the very best of the 5th Doctor's adventures... I only recently just watched it again after hurrying to buy the set and it is just as superb a time-travel/science fiction story now as it ever was... and features doubly one of the all time great and beloved DW characters of course: The Brigadier always played masterfully by Nicholas Courtney.
I'm sure many people feel that Enlightenment is the crown jewel of this set and in all honesty I still have yet to watch Terminus again after 30 years but I am looking forward to it. Most stories that have either the entrance or departure of a companion or a Doctor are significant stories just for those facts and Nyssa was a nice character.
I'm not a fan of Turlough to be honest and the whole Black Guardian aspect to these stories is my least favorite, Turlough was prob one of my very least favorite companions all in all, but that's just me.
Even with Turlough and the whole Black Guardian thing going on Mawdryn Undead stands out as a great time travel story. I love how Tegan places the 4th Doctor's coat onto Mawdryn when they think he is Doctor No. 6 and he wears it for a long time.

My personal top 5th Doctor stories are: Castravala, Four to Doomsday, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Time-Flight, Arc of Infinity, Mawdryn Undead, The Five Doctors, Ressurection of the Daleks, Planet of Fire and Caves of Androzani.

I was introduced to Doctor Who through Tm Baker but I really hit my stride watching the show with Peter Davison so like David Tennant Peter Davison was MY Doctor...
More or less it's a 50/50 split, but Davision was around when I was going into my teenage years whereas Baker will always be linked more with my childhood. Davison was the 5th Doctor when MTV debuted, when Duran Duran was new and on the airwaves, when Ronald Reagan was President, it was the height of the Cold War and every school kid knew it could be their last day on Planet Earth if we and Russia launched our missiles. It was the time of Ghostbusters and Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back, it was Knight Rider and Night Court, Michael Jackson could do no wrong then and the jacket and the one-handed glove was in. It was a wonderful time to be a teenager in the early 80's when so much was new and exciting because it was the 80's!",1393459200,2,2698,4.448484848484848

3937501,4,B002IW62FK,"This series of three very-interconnected episodes introduces Turlough as a compromised companion and ends with his redemption by his own choice.  The doctor is once again involved in a contest between the Black Guardian and the White Guardian, the former of which is still very cross with the Doctor from the events of the Key to Time series that occurred during his Fourth Regeneration. To destroy the Doctor, the Black Guardian seeks to corrupt one of his companions.

The three episodes that make up the trilogy vary in quality.  I was disappointed by Mawdryn Undead, which has an appearance by the retired Brigadier Leftbridge Stewart. His character is teaching at a boy's school, and actually appears as two versions of himself in the episode. Terminus is a pretty decent episode in itself, but I would suggest that the viewer use the CGI Special Effects Option included as a special feature to improve the episode.  The viewer should be aware that this is Nyssa's final episode, but that she departs on good terms.  I really enjoyed the third episode, Enlightenment, which resolves the conflict between Guardians, and redeems Turlough as a companion.  This edition of the DVD offers a theatrical cut of this episode, put together by the original producer and the BBC.  This special edition offers very good CGI special effects, and a completely restored story.  I highly recommend the viewer watch this version.  Enlightenment has become one of my favorite Fifth Doctor episodes due to this theatrical version.

The set also offers excellent extras with lots of interviews by the cast and producers, including a nice interview with Nicholas Briggs on the Mawdryn Undead DVD.  There are lots of the making-of informational extras as well.  Overall, this DVD set is a good value for the price, and offers three Fifth Doctor epiosodes varying in quality from decent to great.",1373932800,,1878,5.02258064516129
3937502,4,B002IW62FK,"The Black Guardian from the Key of Time Season of Doctor Who returns...and man is he PO'd! Tom Baker's Doctor ruined his plans during season 16, so the Black Guardian is seeking his revenge. The Black Guardian role is reprised by Valentine Dyall, who is magnificent. Dyall's awesome performance adds immensely to each episode. This guy is way, way, way over-the-top (in the best way possible)and has some great quotable dialog. Why doesn't the Black Guardian make more appearance in Doctor Who?

The Mawdryn Undead introduces us to the character of Turlough and reintroduces us to the Brigadier. The plot is okay for the original Doctor Who series, but not very exciting.

In Terminus, we say goodbye to Nyssa(Sarah Sutton). I guess the TARDIS was getting crowded again. Otherwise, this is a totally forgettable episode.

Enlightenment may be my favorite episode of all time! It is very whimsical, yet intelligent. Sailing around the planets, in 19th century ships could be the silliest thing ever imagined, yet everyone plays it straight and gives wonderful performances. The trilogy is worth buying for this episode alone. There are also some pretty good bonus features too!

For the first-time viewer, the setup of the Dr Who series is basic enough - the Doctor is an alien who adventures in time and space in his TARDIS, usually with a human companion or two - but continuity references anchor this trilogy. The Brigadier (Mawdryn Undead) was a significant character in Seasons 7-12 and the Doctor fell foul of the Black Guardian when seeking the Key to Time for the White Guardian in Season 16.

Yes, we all know the BBC didn't have much money, their productions were continually disrupted by strikes, the state of special effects has moved on since then and these stories would be made very differently today.  If you can get past all that to focus on the characters, scripts and acting,  I think these are strong Dr Who stories and definitely worth your time.  This is in no small part because of Peter Davison, who I think is the best actor who's ever held the role.

In Mawdryn Undead, there's a  car crash, a private school, a luxury space liner, an emergency landing for the TARDIS, an old friend of the Doctor's, split time zones, weird aliens and all too many coincidences.  The Black Guardian is back and he wants the Doctor dead.  His tool?  An unhappy schoolboy called Turlough.

Mawdryn Undead is a strong story that's driven by the friendship between the Doctor and the Brigadier, and the friendship between the Doctor and his female companions.  Every character is given a decent role that plays to their strengths and the acting is solid.  The story combines inventive set design and outdoor scenes, the costumes are imaginative, and the editing helps the story build as events in the past are revealed and affect the present.  The premise of the story is unusual - aliens try to guilt-trip the Doctor into shortening his own life to help them die - but it's hard to care what happens to the manipulative Mawdryn and his freaky friends, and there's too much running back and forth in the final episode.

Turlough makes a good debut here, manipulated by the Black Guardian and the Doctor both, struggling to reconcile desire for his promised reward with his conscience, afflicted by cowardice and his inclination to deceit.  Mark Strickson does well in the role and plays well off Peter Davison (unlike Matthew Waterhouse).  Some of Turlough's scenes with the Black Guardian are truly eerie.

In Terminus, Turlough sabotages the TARDIS, forcing the Doctor to make an emergency docking with a nearby spaceship.  When the ship arrives at its destination, it's revealed they're on a plague ship delivering lazars to their one, dubious hope of a cure: Terminus.  Terminus is a huge decaying hulk at the centre of the universe (yes, I know that's stupid) crewed by slaves of the mysterious Terminus Inc., and the Doctor needs to unlock its secrets to avert the ultimate disaster.  But Nyssa has contracted lazar disease and the Black Guardian is still taking a hand in events ...

If you put the dodgy physics, plot holes and woeful fight scenes aside, this is good story.  Terminus really does have an ""abandon hope all ye who enter here"" atmosphere, with its shambling, disheartened lazars, the hard-bitten Vanir and junky, cluttered spaces.  The Doctor and Nyssa arrive in the midst of rising radiation levels and power plays amongst the Vanir, and it's their intelligence and compassion that precipitate change, promising a brighter future for Terminus and those sent there.  They're aided in this by the pirates Kari and Olvir and by Valgard, an ambitious Vanir.  Yet introducing these outsiders sidelines Tegan and Turlough, who have little to do but hide out in air conditioning ducts and snipe at each other.  The look of this production really contributes to the story, and the acting ranges from passable to excellent.  Nyssa's departure scene fits her character really well and is suitably touched with emotion.

In Enlightenment, the White Guardian makes his presence felt as the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough find themselves on an Edwardian yacht with a very strange crew.  The Eternals are racing for Enlightenment, but who will win and at what cost?

I'm going to go against the trend and say that I find Enlightenment the least satisfying of the trilogy.  The concept of the Eternals seeking to put some meaning in their lives is an excellent one (think of the sidhe, trying a human role on for size while never really understanding what they're doing or why it's important), and the interaction between Tegan and Marriner (Christopher Brown) really brings out how strange and empty they are.  Brown plays his role very well, while Keith Barron (Captain Striker) is suitably cold and focused.  The costumes are gorgeous throughout and the conclusion is dramatically satisfying.  But the look of the production is very dark, the interior sets don't really evoke ships, Lydia Barron (Captain Wrack) overracts horribly, and the pace drags.  For me, the feel of a race just isn't there.

Do these stories actually make a trilogy?  That's debatable, since they were all written by different authors operating with different concepts and no-one seems to have stepped in to ensure that this is one story told in three parts.  Do some creative interpretation of your own to make these stories function as a whole. Despite the presence of both Guardians, who loosely represent Good and Evil, you won't find any real insights into how the Dr Who universe functions.  They're just a convenient plot device.

I won't comment on the special features since I usually ignore them, but it's excellent to finally have these stories released, and as a set, too!",1330214400,,6159,5.212182741116751

8371224,5,B002IW62FK,"This was a good story arc. Bringing back the Black Guardian was a great idea and made for three stories which held a common thread between them. I especially enjoyed the last story in the trilogy, ""Enlightenment"", which I felt was well written.",1429142400,,244,4.6976744186046515
8371225,4,B002IW62FK,"Four Seasons after the Doctor denied him the Key of Time, the Black Guardian returns for Doctor Who's 20th in this three part story with the goal of killing the Doctor.

These three stories see one companion join the TARDIS crew while another leaves. and the return of an old friend.

The story arc begins with Maedryn Undead which finds the Doctor seperated from the TARDIS and its crew but reunited with the Brigadier for the first time in 7 seasons, as the Black Guardian recruits an alien teenager at an English school to kill the Doctor. The story is wonderful fun with thee great return of the Brigadier, a tough decision for the Doctor, and an introduction of a new conflict. This story's about an 8 or 9 out of 10.

The second story is, ""Terminus"" which is very good for 2/3 of the First episode. The majority of the episode was spent with the TARDIS crew wandering about an eerie station. However, this gives way to a mishmash of plots that are impossible to keep up with , with characters wandering all about the ship and doing very little interesting. Then we have an absurd plot point that has the Big Bang resulting from exploding fuel and fear that a second leak could destroy the Universe. (And even the Director doesn't think this plot is worth focusing on as it continues to flash between five or six Point of View characters.) The story features Nyssa infamously losing her skirt when she becomes ill. The Black Guardian looks like an idiot for choosing Turlough for this task, and given the focus of this trilogy, the whole Black Guardian plot gets shoved to the sidelines. The only thing to save Terminus was Nyssa's decision to leave the TARDIS and its context. It's quite brave and noble. Overall, I give this a 4/10.

Then we have ""Enlightenment"": A female written and directed story that introduces the Eternals and a sailing race in space. This is a fascinating plot with great elements and Turlough's mental anguish finally gives to a head. There's a nice twist ending. It's not perfect and not quite as good as Maedryn Undead but it's a lot of fun and nicely resolved the whole Black Guardian plot. Overall, I'll give this an 8 out of 10.

Bottom line is that the set gives you one of the worst stories of the Fifth Doctor era sandwiched between two very good and important stories and it's a nice piece of Doctor Who history.",1423440000,,2353,4.553191489361702
