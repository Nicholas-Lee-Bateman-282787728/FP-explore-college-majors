6142504,2,B00H9I41D8,"It was not horrible, just not that good of a movie. The movie took place in a cabin in the swamp, and not the place that you would imagine a group of girls to party at for vacation. The actors did what they could with the script, which was pretty poor and not a shock on who the killer turned out to be. Some of the scens were comical, but the special effect swere cheap and too kaway some from the movie.",1436313600,,405,3.951219512195122

6142510,3,B00H9I41D8,"It was fun. Some of the dialog cracked me up, my favorite lines: ""I graduated from ninja school ten years ago"", ""did you just throw a tomahawk at me!?"" Yeah, yeah the acting was pretty bad, but bad acting is even present in Hollywood films.

Two girls take their tops off briefly, there is some blood, there is a swamp and there are certainly bikinis.

Would rate higher but some of the editing was crazy weird.",1435363200,2,411,4.394736842105263
6142511,2,B00H9I41D8,"Folks, seriously, I'm pretty sure the reason I'm the first person to review this wonderful piece of cinematic excrement is that I'm the only one who has survived watching it so far!

Oh the horror!!!!

Now PLEASE understand, I live for crap cinema. I really do. The worse a movie is the more I love it. I have a massive collection of many hundreds of DVDs and Blu-Rays to prove it.

But this movie made my brain hurt.

SPOILERS...
First of all that fashion show at the pool. I hate to waste beer but I wanted to knock myself out with the bottle to make it stop.

Then very soon after that horror the ""main girl"" says to her creepy uncle that she's going to the Everglades, then just seconds later says literally the opposite to ""Mama Bear"", some older skanky woman chaperone chick. Blech. But then she calls someone and leaves a message saying she's going. ACK!  That all took place in less than 2 minutes.

That's a very tame example of the illogic involved here.

And the girls? Yeah, 4 bonified hotties and 2 swamp skanks so you figure at the very least the skanks would get all kinds of naked right? NOPE!

You see nice boobies at the very beginning from some random babe who quickly dies. Then a seriously cute black chick at the pool is shown topless but you need the freeze frame/frame advance to see much. And then....duh duh duh...nothing... I gave 2 stars for the 2 topless babes, but it really deserves a 1.

I want to cry because my favorite girl was of course the first one to die, while going to the outdoor shower!!! She gets topless but facing away of course and we don't even see a good side boob shot. Then the a-hole killed her ending any other chance!!!!!!!!! That guy is SO gay, not that there's anything wrong with that. Still...A-hole!!!

Arrgghhhh???!!!!!!!! Can you feel my disgust?

Oh, and even the maybe 20 seconds of barely decent LEZ kissing doesn't save it...but the blonde was amazing.

OK, I have to stop now because it gets worse and worse and thank god for the fast forward button.

I know all I'm doing here is making you want to see this turd but that's all on you and don't come crying to me when you do and claw your own eyes out.

Later, I need a beer or 12 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh wait, sorry, one last thing.: If a crazed looking Indian dude in full garb and carrying a hatchet, bloody or not, walks up to you ranting crazily, don't just start talking to him. RUN LIKE HELL!!!!

AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!",1407542400,11,2436,4.401785714285714

6142564,5,B00H9I41D8,This movie rocks! It's exactly what you would expect from a Troma release! =) B-movie horror and gore and fun! Yes there is some nudity too. I liked it and will recommend to my friends. We love Troma and crazy movies. This one was better than most. Good work guys! I like it a lot!,1439164800,,281,4.127272727272727

6142568,2,B00H9I41D8,"So I gave this one a 2 star rating. Why, you ask? Because I am a glutton for bad acting, bad special effects and bad story. Especially if it is a Lloyd Kaufman, Troma Team release. Of all their movies, I doubt if they have spent $100,000. And they have made a bunch of films. Probably the best from the Troma Team -- The Toxic Avenger. This is bad but delightfully so. This is fun, demented, and incredibly bad. Looking for a laugh and a no need to pay too much attention to what is going on movie, this will work. Just laid back, relax and enjoy fun. Don't go into it with hopes of a really great movie - this is definitely not an academy awards nominee.",1438387200,,655,4.125
