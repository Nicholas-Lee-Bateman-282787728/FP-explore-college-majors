3829151,5,B001XW7ID6,"In Episode 36, Elliot Carson asks, ""All the solid citizens of Peyton Place are good people, aren't they?"" to which sensible Ada Jacks replies wryly, ""That's the New England story if you want to believe it."" Well, don't believe it for a second. As the continuing story of Peyton Place unfolds in this second DVD set from Shout Factory, viewers learn that everything in the town of 9,875 is not really as it seems. While the previous DVD set established core characters and laid the foundation for stories, Peyton Place truly begins firing on all cylinders in the next 31 episodes.

Among the shorter story arcs presented: George and Julie Anderson's marriage crumbles as George begins hallucinating and flashing back to his experiences in World War II. After running away to New York, Betty meets sophisticated ""kept woman"" Sharon Purcell (a luminous performance by actress Dayna Ceder -whatever happened to her?). Although Betty's New York adventure only lasts for six episodes, its impact will reverberate throughout the remainder of the program's run when Leslie Harrington's private detective makes a grievous misinterpretation of Betty's interaction with Sharon's associates. In other stories, Rodney and Allison move tentatively toward a relationship, while Norman Harrington finds a kindred spirit in the underprivileged Rita Jacks. Patricia Morrow's sensitive portrayal of a bad-girl-gone-good is absolutely flawless, with Rita eventually becoming one of the most beloved characters in the series.

However, it is Elliot Carson's return to Peyton Place in episode 32 which really drives the narrative for the next 30 episodes. In an epic plot involving all of the major characters, dark secrets are finally exposed as Elliot fights to prove his innocence in the brutal murder of his adulterous wife Elizabeth eighteen years earlier. This long story arc culminates with a violent conclusion more or less cribbed years later for the second season finale of Falcon Crest. When the real killer of Elizabeth Carson is ultimately revealed in episode 62, many lives in Peyton Place will be changed forever...

3829152,5,B001XW7ID6,"There is no question about it. The best episodes of Peyton Place were the ones which starred Mia Farrow. Mia Farrow is the virginal heroine of the story, who stays innocent, among all the backstabbing, lies of all around her. When Mia left the show, a void was placed, which was never filled. Mia looked so beautiful with her long flowing blonde hair. Also, it was nice to see Mia quoting poetry and using it to understand the troubled world around her. Other beauty queens of the show were Barbara Parkins, Dorothy Malone, Casey Rogers and Lee Grant.

Highlights of the first season: The triangle of Rodney Harrington, Betty Anderson and Alison Mackenzie, Constance Mackenzie's dark secret from her daughter, the romantic development of Dr. Rossi and Constance Mackenzie, the wonderful acting of Casey Rogers as Mrs. Anderson, and the introduction of Lee Grant as Stella Chernak, who blows the other cast members away with her acting. I will not go into details of the plots because I am not a spoiler. It more fun for you to watch this for yourself.

I commend Shout: Factory for releasing these episodes so quickly to the Peyton Place fans and hopefully, a new generation of fans. It would be nice to have interviews with the surviving cast members of the show, especially Barbara Parkins, Mia Farrow and Dorothy Malone. Also, it would be nice to have the two t.v. movies based on the show released as a bonus feature.

Anyway, I love this show and thanks Shout for releasing this on dvd.",1238025600,27,1491,4.726923076923077
3829153,5,B001XW7ID6,"Shout! Factory is releasing ""Peyton Place-Part 2"" even before Part 1 is out, so this confirms to us that the studio is dedicated in bringing back this blockbuster soap via DVD format. I for one am very happy. ""Peyton Place"" was never released commercially through VHS, and this marks the first time the series has ever been on DVD. The serial has also been  rarely seen through television during the last several decades. The only time I recall when ""Peyton Place"" was on was in the late 1990's when Romance Classics aired it, but unfortunately the channel went off the air before the entire library of shows were broadcast. Those episodes that did air were jumpy and scratchy. Now thanks to DVD we will see ""Peyton Place"" the way it should be shown; in crystle-clear digital format.
 This boxset contains 33 30 minute episodes, uncut, without commercials. The reason the studio is releasing the boxsets in ""Parts"" is because the serial did not run from season to season, but rather was broadcast like a continuing soap opera. ""Peyton Place"" ran continuously for 5 full years, every week, with a brand new episode, and it never aired reruns, or had a summer hiatus period; it ran straight through the summer with new shows. The serial is the only primtime series to ever air with all-new shows for its entire run, and no other show has ever done this since.
 The first year was the show's best as Ryan O'Neil and Mia Farrow played star-crossed lovers Rodney and Allison. Things got worse for them as Betty Anderson, played by Barbara Parkins, pursued Rodney.
 ""Peyton Place"" is regarded by most soap opera critics as being one of the best network serials ever broadcast, and it gave way to other primetime shows like ""Dynasty"". Even ""Peyton Place"" star Dorothy Malone stated in 1985 that ""Dynasty"" was her favorite all-time serial.
 The serial was based on the 1957 Lana Turner film of the same name, that received a whopping 9 Academy Award nominations, but winning none. That film, was in turn, based on a novel written by Grace Matalious in 1956. ABC bought the television rights, and in conjuction with 20th Century Fox, produced this television version. At first ABC was going to air an American adaption of Britain's ""Coronation Street"", but later felt audiences wouldn't warm up to the working-class storyline. The network even hired daytime soap opera creator/writer Irna Phillips, widely regarded as the ""Queen of Soaps"", to be a consultant.
 514 episodes of ""Peyton Place"" were produced, and the show ran from September 15, 1964-June 2, 1969, and it even spawned a daytime serial, that was only moderately successful, called ""Return to Peyton Place"", that ran on NBC from 1972-1974. Two TV movies also aired after the mothershow went off the air; ""Murder in Peyton Place"" aired in 1977, and in 1985 ""Peyton Place-The Next Generation"" was broadcast on NBC.
 Sit back and enjoy a true classic televison program. They don't make soaps like this anymore!",1237852800,45,2960,4.861111111111111

This was her ""adult"" time and although I tried to sneek and peek, I always ended up in bed.  So I promised myself when I got to be an adult, I would watch this series from start to finish.  Fast-forward fifty years and ta-daa!  I have my own DVDs of this adult soap opera to watch whenever I want.  In its time the novel and subsequent series were downright scandalous (yes, I finally got to read the book too!).  By today's tawdry standards, it's tame if not downright hokey in parts, but I see it for what it was - stories of conflict, love, deceit, backstabbing, distrust/misplaced trust, and just good old juicy naughtiness.

3829168,4,B001XW7ID6,"I was too young to watch Peyton Place when it first aired but heard of it often as a kid as one of the great TV shows in documentary specials about the history of TV.  I was glad to finally be able to taste the series and loved Part One.  I became obsessed with it.  Part two unfortunately had long periods where I was bored but gradually the show captured me again.  The solution of the death of a character 18 years ago was a bit unsatisfactory for me.  Didn't quite buy the so called truth of the matter.  Investigation please!  Still the older actors of Dorothy Malone, Ed Nelson and Warner Anderson give the show a solid cast and the younger actors give the blow out performances- Mia Farrow, Ryan O'Neal and Barbara Parkins are wonderful and Marietta Hartley joined the cast before the end of Part Two.  They are impressive and wonderful to see them in their early careers.  Richard Evans is great as the college professor who creepily hangs out with his students and known to a few as the brother of the murdered woman Elliot was sent to prison for.",1419638400,,1056,4.402061855670103

3829215,5,B001XW7ID6,"I am a great fan of this series---I remember watching it when it was first telecast in the 60's and 70's and it was a really hot show.  I have really enjoyed Parts 1 and 2 so where is Part 3.  It's been over a year since Part 2 was released and no one seems to know why they stopped releasing episodes of this series.
Shout Factory just says that they were only given permission to issue Parts 1 and 2---so I guess the dollar stops at 20th Century Fox who owns all the episodes of ""Peyton Place"".  I tried to contact them but there's no number to call and, of course, nobody replies to emails that I sent about this either. Is 20th Century Fox asking too much money for the series?  Didn't they make any money from releasing Parts 1 & 2?  Just what is the story here.  By the time Part 3 comes out, I'll have to rewatch Parts 1 & 2 again just to get back into the storyline.",1319760000,7,874,4.023121387283237

the story again. Seeing the old cars, buildings, fashion, & hairdo's takes me back many years. I am hanging at this point, because I want to purchase season 3 & 4 and it has not been available.

3829230,5,B001XW7ID6,"QUITE...A 40-YEAR+ MEMORY STIR!!  Viewers will be taken back in time when morality and values held a stronger place in society.  Things were more SANE then.  The quality in Black & White for the 1st & this 2nd set of DVD's is very good, and the theme behind Peyton Place with the music is quite lovely and well-done.  The script writers  & characters are Top Notch for this TV series, and those purchasing this set may find it difficult to QUIT watching...as this series was..and can be still quite addicting, and it may HOOK YOU into spending HOURS...as you're drawn into the gripping PLOTS...that will HOLD You from episode to episode.

Watching this series by those who enjoyed it during earlier years...WILL BE EVEN BETTER with added appreciation of the depth of characters, story plots and efforts by the TEAM of who took part with this well-crafted series.

Seeing...Dorothy Malone, Mia Farrow, & Barbara Parkins are  especially notable, but the same could be said of Ryan O'Neal, Warner Anderson, Ed  Nelson, Christopher Connelly, Paul Langton, & Tim O'Connor with the rest of the impressive cast of characters.  SO!  ..If you like TV soaps, with a good cast of characters with well-written scripts, with well directed & talented actors...you will very likely ENJOY having this TV series grace your DVD player!

By the way, the 3rd DVD set isn't available yet, but efforts to ""Pry It"" forth once again..continue !!",1294012800,5,1421,4.899581589958159

From Shout Factory:
Thanks for being a fan!  We only had the rights to put out the first two, however, we are in talks with the company that owns the rights, to see if we can put out any more.  Stay tuned to our website for more information, [...].

3829235,3,B001XW7ID6,"I was one of millions of viewers who were addicted to the Peyton Place TV series back in the '60s. ABC never repeated the telecasts, and none of the very few attempts by local affiliates to run them in syndication years later lasted more than a very brief while. So I was thrilled when I saw that the series was finally being released on DVD, and I bought the first two installments. (One can't really speak of a ""season"" of Peyton Place, since it ran all year without any repeats.) My first reactions were mixed. The quality of the image varies; there are far too many scenes where everything is so dark you can't even see the actors' facial features--I don't recall it looking that way originally; obviously there has been deterioration of the film. And, judging from the two sets that have been released, I had also not recalled how truly bizarre and banal much of the dialogue is. Non sequiturs follow each other in rapid succession, almost like a parody of soap operas. But it is still enormous fun to watch extremely young incarnations of Ryan O'Neal, Barbara Parkins and Mia Farrow--they're supposed to be in their teens, but at the start of the series were actually 23, 22 and 19, respectively--and you do find yourself getting drawn into the storyline. But, like those early syndication efforts, this is another case of being left hanging. There have been no further DVD releases, and I see no plans for any. The two five-disc sets released contain a total of 64 episodes, a drop in the bucket when you consider that the series ran for 514 episodes. So there's no point in investing your time and money to wind up in a dead end.",1271289600,14,1637,4.571428571428571
3829236,5,B001XW7ID6,This has been a fantastic trip down memory lane.  As a child I use to always watch this with my dad.  When I started watching the dvd it took me back to a fun time in my childhood.  I fell in love with this series and will continue to buy all 5 years of dvd's.  It was also a trip to be watching in black and white.  If you were a Peyton Place follower this is a perfect series to get your fix of nostalgia.,1264550400,2,407,3.7411764705882353
3829257,4,B001XW7ID6,"I loved both part one and two of this fabulous tv series. When I was a child in Malaysia we had this series on tele. Unfortunately I cannot remember if my country tv station showed all the seasons. I would have if it did. In short, when can we the fans of this tv series of a bygone era have our subsequent parts of this fondly tv series  on dvd?",1262131200,2,346,3.942857142857143
3829258,5,B001XW7ID6,"I highly recommend this series! The acting (by then relatively unknown actors who would soon become big stars) is superb. The pacing is fast, without long drawn-out storylines. Mia Farrow and Barbara Parkins are absolutely gorgeous! I'm a big fan of the 60s soap ""Dark Shadows"" which is also set in New England. This series has some of the same feel, without the supernatural aspects. Let's hope for more releases of this classic show soon!",1261872000,4,440,4.88
3829259,5,B001XW7ID6,It was as I remembered as a kid. I enjoyed watching it very much and seeing the actors in their younger years.

3829260,5,B001XW7ID6,"I thoroughly enjoyed both part one and part two of Peyton Place TV show from the 60's. The only bad thing was that there is no release date on the next parts and you were left in the middle of a cliff hanger, so it is a bit frustrating to be left hanging. the show was very entertaining, I never saw the original series when it was on as I was too young. Some of the characters were different from the peyton Place movie which was a little confusing, as I had seen the movie and had to remember not to confuse the characters. I never read the book so I don't know which is the truer version. Regardless I still loved the series and hope they release the rest of it soon.",1254096000,3,670,4.045112781954887
3829261,5,B001XW7ID6,"I just finished  set 1 and got set 2 in the mail the next day - thank goodness because I could not wait to continue the story, so to speak and had to get it here.  Now, here I sit starting disc two of set 2 and starting to get nervous about the Shout! Factory commitment to continue to release the show.  Too many companies have dashed my hopes for a full series release and I just hope that they keep up the releases on a speedy basis - none of this 5 years between sets business.

I do tend to like dramas, and soaps as it is but was surprised that something from so many years ago. in black and white would be so enjoyable.  I really love it-the ways in which nothing has changed and the many ways in which everything has changed (some for the better, some for the worse) and overall, I just love everything about it.

Thanks you Shout Factory for many hours of enjoyment, and starting a whole new generation of PP fans!",1253664000,3,923,4.128491620111732

The nostalgia of watching this show when it was a better World back then knocks me over. I hope the whole series comes out on DVD. If they can do it with ""Dark Shadows"" they can do it with Peyton Place.",1505174400,,480,4.0
