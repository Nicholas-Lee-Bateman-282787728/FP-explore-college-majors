8499014,3,B006IXRJ98,"Another short review, not because what is offered is bad but because there it little to say about it. There is no plot and Betty White whose name appears loud and clear on the front has little to do with the end product.

Snippets of interviews with White as she talks about her love of animals are mingled with documentary styled footage taken at various locales around the world. Beginning with some of the greatest National Parks in the US, the film shows wildlife from all of the countries and attempts to have the viewer realize the importance of preserving some of these areas. The best part about that is that it doesn't do so in an abrasive manner but shows each area and discusses the wild life located there. The viewer has the chance to make their own mind up about the importance of these areas.

White is on hand to discuss her love of the animals and some of the areas, even relating her own personal experiences with her family when she was a child visiting Yellowstone every summer. She also discusses a project she's involved in that connects disabled children with horses.

The DVD is an enjoyable entertainment for fans of channels like NatGEO or Animal Planet. It's something that the kids can watch and hopefully get a feel of the importance of nature. Fans of animal films will want to add this to their collection.",1339977600,,1337,4.585774058577406
8499015,4,B006IXRJ98,"Is Betty White the most beloved woman in America?  Reuters says she is ""the most trusted celebrity in the world.""  Her remarkable charm and charisma oozes from the screen in this heartfelt documentary from producer Robert Kline.  (Yes, that's the same Robert Kline that is doing a series on First Women at the Rancho Mirage Library.)

This heartwarming documentary takes you across continents as Betty shares anecdotes about her own cherished pets as well as memorable experiences with the organizations that make the world of animals available to all. I especially liked the heroic stories of military canine corps.  The journey includes visits to America's national parks, world-class zoos and aquariums.  Is there any doubt that we humans have a duty to protect and understand our fellow creatures with which we share our increasingly small and fragile planet?  Betty White is a warrior for a worthy cause that, in the end, affects all.",1332979200,2,939,5.098039215686274
