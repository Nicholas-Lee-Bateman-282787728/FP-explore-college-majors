932428,4,6304811233,"I guess since this was one of the last collection videos, this one got all the left-over stories. The stories on here are good, but not superb(except for James In A Mess). Here they are:

1)Old Iron 4/5

2)James In A Mess 6/5

3)Duck Takes Charge 4/5

4)Down The Mine 4/5

5)The Runaway 4.5/5

6)Better Late Than Ever 4/5

7)Tenders & Turntables 5/5

8)Percy Proves A Point 3.5/5

9)Trust Thomas 5/5

10)Percy & The Signal 4/5

I'd buy this Thomas video if your a new fan of Thomas, but for a lifetime fan like me, it's not worth it.",1100390400,3,533,4.282828282828283
932429,5,6304811233,"We have been watching Thomas videos from the library for some time now and wanted to make a purchase.
I found that Thomas & His Friends Get Along is the ONLY DVD narrated entirely by George Carlin.  All the other Thomas DVD's are Alec Baldwin (he's just plain annoying and lifeless).  I know we're not the only ones who think so based on the many other reviews.  We don't mind Ringo or George's narration but there are no Ringo DVD's available.  All the older titles on DVD have been re-dubbed with Alec Baldwin's voice over.(DEAL BREAKER)
I know the narrator is never mentioned on Amazon so, for those of you who are interested...I hope this helped.",1088553600,18,650,4.577586206896552
932430,4,6304811233,"First off I would like to make a few points out to the other reviwers. How would you like a show where trains got along merry and they always were nice and they never had a accident. When I was little I always watched Thomas. My sister loves Thomas and I wouldn't want her to stop watching because the content is innapprobriate. And when this says Thomas and his friends get along didn't they always make up.
Anyway I'm disappointed and the fact that Tenders & Turntables, Thomas Breaks The Rules and Better Late Than Never were discontinued. In my opinion these three were the best of the five oringinal ones. What even more saddened me was that they redid them as George Carlin narrations. I think that George Carlin is great but he tried to be Ringo Starr too much. In the beginning tapes Gordon had a different personality that he tried to imitate. I also think that in most of George Carlin's vidoes Ringo would do a terrible job. My personal favorite video is Tenders & Turntables and I liked the order of those episodes.
Well I can't change what's done so my advice to you would be to find a used copy of these videos from somewhere else. My little sister really doesn't know the difference yet so it may not matter that much.",1076976000,,1233,4.436123348017621
932431,1,6304811233,"We got this out of the library a few weeks ago and I was appalled to see what counts as ""getting along:""
- The big engines get miffed at everyone else and decide to go on strike (end of story).
- An engine is insulted by the helicopter; they have a race, the engine wins, and his engineer makes up a nasty little song to celebrate.
I do not tolerate this kind of behavior in my kids, and I will not tolerate it in a video - my kids have enough negative role models.
Look to George and Martha tapes for better role models in ""getting along.""",1054771200,,540,4.05607476635514
932432,5,6304811233,"My son has been watching Thomas videos for about a year, and this one is one of the best.  He particularly likes Thomas because of his cheerful manner.  In this video, he was introduced to Harold the helicopter, who he also loves.
These videos show how the engines deal with specific problems that they face.  I feel that overall the problems are solved in an acceptable manner for children.  Sir Topham Hatt serves as a kind of parental figure for the engines and he points out any problems the engines might be having, but he also is quick to praise them for a job well-done.
George Carlin does an excellent job narrating the video, and there are six episodes on the tape.  The length (36 minutes) is perfect for my son.  He can usually watch the whole video in a single sitting, whereas he will lose interest in a longer movie.
Although there is some disagreement and arguing amongst the engines, this is still an appropriaate tape for young children.  I think people will enjoy this and all Thomas & Friends videos as my son and I do.",1043107200,6,1038,4.48936170212766
932433,2,6304811233,"I chose this particular Thomas video based on the rave reviews shown here. I find it hard to believe that anyone actually watched the tape! This is my first exposure to Thomas, so maybe the series is all like this, but I found the characters to be just horrible. Almost all of the stories involve the trains being mean, petty, or vindictive. Occasionally they make up at the end of the story, but only because they *must* due to circumstance. I don't see any lessons in here that I'd like my son to learn. At this point (20 months), he just likes the visuals, but once he begins to understand more of the concepts shown in the video, the tape will be retired.
To say something positive about the tape - I love George Carlin's narrative, and the visuals are nice. If the characters weren't so awful, I'd have really liked the tape.",999129600,4,830,4.431372549019608

Just ordered our second set of them because he likes to hold one of them when he's watching the other and they're starting to get a little scratched.

As for the other review that called these ""lame"" because their lips don't move: what next, complaining that all of the smurfs are blue?",1297987200,2,423,4.4935064935064934
