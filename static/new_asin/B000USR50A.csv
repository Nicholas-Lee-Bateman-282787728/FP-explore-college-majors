2925163,5,B000USR50A,"If you like well-made silent photoplays, and/or if you're a fan of Ronald Colman and/or Gary Cooper, then check out this edtion THE WINNING OF BARBARA WORTH (1926).

The dub is from a near-pristine film that includes original tinting (modern audiences are often unaware that color was integral to most 1920s features). Highlights of the picture include spectacular Nevada scenery and fine special effects (a dust storm and flood).

It's basically a love triangle set in the desert Southwest with a correlative plot of an irrigation development swindle.

SYNOPSIS--
Abandoned infant Barbara (Vilma Bnky) was found in the desert and adopted by Jefferson Worth (Charles Lane). Now a young woman, Barbara is courted by Abe Lee (Gary Cooper), foreman of her dad's ranch.

Wealthy city-dwelling developer James Greenfield (E.J. Ratcliffe) arrives with plans to irrigate and reclaim desert land; Mr. Worth strikes a deal with him. Greenfield's foster son Willard (Ronald Colman) falls in love with Barbara, which makes her childhood sweetheart Abe madly jealous.

Greenfield gets several ranchers to invest; he constructs a dam across the river. When he decides to abandon his irrigation project rather than spend money to reinforce the dam, Greenfield panics the locals by saying that it will soon fail. He then leaves town with the ranchers' investment. They all seek safer ground as well, and then threaten to torch the town when a now impoverished Hoilmes is unable to meet his payroll.

Meanwhile, the Colorado River continues to rise. The dam buckles and gives way. Some remarkable footage of human tragedy ensues.",1247702400,7,1613,5.232558139534884
2925164,4,B000USR50A,"The Winning of Barbara Worth is an interesting film for its stars, but it is also an impressive western. Set at the turn of the century where the west was still abundant with open land but where automobiles penetrated every environment, this film retains modern ideals in the setting of times gone by. A city man named Willard Holmes (Ronald Colman) comes to a small town in the desert to irrigate the land. He and his father believe that it will enable miraculous change in the land, but there is criticism among the natives. One inhabitant is Barbara Worth (Vilma Banky), and adopted daughter to a leader of the town. She begins to fall for Willard despite the towns resentment of him and to the dismay of her childhood sweetheart Abe (Gary Cooper).

All of the actors are fantastic, but it is strange that this film was included in a Gary Cooper boxed set. His part is relatively small. However, he is an excellent rival to Colman's Willard. The two men represent opposite ends of the spectrum, but both are very likable. The most spectacular part of this film is the flood scene; it is proof that sometimes silents really did it better.

This print is pristine and beautifully tinted to various colors including a warm amber and a deep maroon. I was lucky enough to see this film screened at Cinevent where the live accompanyment aided greatly in the telling of the story. True to the spirit of live audio presentations, Gaylord Carter's live organ score is used for this DVD complete with audience reactions. That's not canned laughter you're hearing; that's the real thing.",1191456000,15,1579,4.717391304347826

8214667,5,B000USR50A,"Only one reviewer has mentioned the music that accompanies this silent film.  The fact is, the music lifts it up and drives it home far better than any piano or small orchestra could ever do.  People today assume an organ score is merely a cheap alternative to the real thing, but an IMPROVISED score such as this, played on a Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ, was the industry standard.  No score was written for this film.  Gaylord Carter was one of the greatest at connecting the audience to all of the actions and emotions on the screen, and this film has plenty of both.  Sadly, his name does not appear on the disc or package, but I know because I was there that night and made the recording.  It was January 29, 1971, and the audience included the film's director, Henry King, and the producer's widow: Mrs. Samuel Goldwyn.  (The recording was skillfully synced to the film for this DVD by some unknown but caring expert.  I don't know whether it was taken from the copy I gave to Goldwyn Studios at the time, or the master tape I donated to the Academy Library.)

The music quickly fades out during the short end title, sadly cutting off all applause and a conversation between Gaylord and Mr. King and Mrs. Goldwin.  Mr. King begins by mentioning that Gaylord was a superstar at Grauman's Million Dollar Theatre on Broadway in Los Angeles at the time this film was made.  Then he shares some amazing stories about the production, such as the fact that no wind machines were used.  Sandstorms occurred naturally every afternoon at 2 o'clock.

Anyway, whatever you think of the musical accompaniment, IT IS THE REAL THING!  And the film itself was a major production (costing $300,000 according to Mrs. Goldwyn) and great success, so think of it as a time capsule of popular culture 90 years ago.  It also proves that Gary Cooper was an established supporting player in films before his brief scene in Wings that usually gets the credit for making him a star.  Enjoy it.",1506384000,3,1980,4.630372492836676
8214668,5,B000USR50A,"The old saying is that flame is fleeting and this is certainly true in the case of Barbara Worth who was apparently once a household name.

I first encountered this name as the name of an old general store, now a convenience store, in Glendale, California, and thought it was an unusual name for a store.  It turns out that this name is from the title of a novel by Harold Bell Wright who was the most popular writer in America in the early twentieth century but is now completely unknown.  This is what happens when you concentrate on current topics.

The setting of the story is in the dry southwest around the turn of the century and the main theme is the settling of the land and the attempts to bring in irrigation to make it fertile.  The attempt is portrayed as heroic whereas today it would be portrayed as criminal.  Barbara Worth is the adopted daughter of a rancher and becomes the subject of a romantic contest between a local cowboy, played by Gary Cooper, and a young engineer from the East coast working on an irrigation project.

The young engineer is employed by a big East coast investor who ends up trying to defraud the local population.  One would expect the cowboy to get Barbara Worth but the film takes an unexpected turn when she ends up going to the engineer after he abandons the investor and sides with the local people.  She does this after Cooper realizes his love for her is like that of a brother for a sister.  This sort of self-denial is apparently the moral of the story.  Wright was famous for his moralistic stories but is now forgotten because modern audiences are not interested in this type of old fashioned morality.

This 1926 silent film is mostly in sepia but also in other monochrome colors popular then such as blue (apparently signifying night) and pink.  The film is very well done and the story is easy to follow.  The flooding scene is very good for the time.  The background desert scenery from Nevada and southeastern California used for nearly all the movie is impressive.  At the very end it switches to what is obviously southern California in the 1920s to show the success of the irrigation project.",1444003200,3,2155,4.558441558441558
8214669,3,B000USR50A,"This could have been a really good silent movie, but Hollywood rewrote ""The Winning of Barbara Worth"" by Harold Bell Wright and ruined it (in my opinion). Still, it is a ""must have"" for anyone interested in the history of the Imperial Valley (California) and the Salton Sea. The DVD is fine. It is the re-written storyline I object to.",1408492800,,335,4.6

8214671,5,B000USR50A,"By todays film making standards, this film leaves much to be desired.  However, if you can put yourself into both the period of the film and get past the technical limitations of the time in which it was made, you can appreciate they way this early piece film making skillfully interprets one of the best selling novels of its time.  This was the first major role for Gary Cooper and a must have for any Cooper fan.",1355616000,3,415,4.376623376623376
8214672,4,B000USR50A,This movie was filmed outside Gerlach Nevada and I knew some of the people that were in it as extra's.  A fun old movie to watch.,1341014400,2,129,3.9615384615384617
8214673,5,B000USR50A,"I ordered this movie because I had learned (from a Nevada trivia book I had received as a gift) that it was filmed entirely in Nevada and its ""special effects"" were real occurrences.  I received the DVD very quickly.  In the package was a note from the seller providing some background information on the movie and suggesting two other movies that were also filmed in Nevada.  We had a delightful and informative email exchange.  I have only lived in Nevada a few years and am interested in learning more about the state so that I can demonstrate to my guests that there's more to Nevada than just ""The Strip"".  Great, helpful seller!",1296345600,4,634,4.625
8214674,5,B000USR50A,"In the 1920's and 30's, Ronald Colman was Hollywood actresses' most popular leading man - the public rated him highly too. Today, however, he is almost unknown - why? because many of his films are difficult/impossible to obtain in DVD format. In others, such as this, his leading role is forgotten - replaced by an actor whose name appeared further down in the credits and who was a supporting actor, at best. Gary Cooper had a minor part in this film, but he's the one whose name is on the packaging of this film. Frankly, his performance consisted of (1)looking wistfully at VIlma Banky (2) scowling at Ronald Colman (3) riding a horse and (4) getting shot (and Ronald Colman rescued him, sent him back to the town on his (Colman's) horse).

Griping aside, this is an enjoyable western, set in the early 20th century. Mr Colman has a line regarding corporations that always gets a laugh from modern, cynical audiences. Watch the film - you'll know which line I'm writing about as soon as you hear it!",1290297600,8,1002,4.629213483146067
8214675,5,B000USR50A,"Fast service on a film which was slow to watch without sound to hear. One of the last silent films, it was easy to follow, despite not hearing Gary Cooper's or Ronald Colman's voices. Interesting experience.",1274832000,3,207,4.777777777777778
