8409782,5,B0001HLT70,"So how much time have you spent seeing/hearing your child's DVDs/videos around the house, even when you aren't really paying attention?  Major time for this Dad. If you have ""Where's Spot"" and Sesame Street tunes burned into your brain, you know what I'm talking about.  Try inserting this one into your child's viewing selection, and see if you get lucky and it enters the mix.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained, and the payoff is BIG. It won't replace the others but at least it will get repeated viewing, you will get a sound break, and it will hold your interest if you catch yourself watching it (Admit it, you watch your child's stuff too; I like the road construction and similar ones best).....A thankful Dad.",1083715200,2,717,4.766129032258065
