Great product.  Simple, brief, and factual.  Please coordinate the use of the video with your facility's policy and procedure for each topic.
Video references CNA training but is a great training tool for all healthcare staff.
The video was clear and a great time saver for review of standard orientation information and facility mandatory in-service.  Video arrived as scheduled and free of shipping damage.",1472947200,,673,7.271604938271605
