590038,5,6303181813,"I am now 8-1/2 months pregnant, and have been doing this video all through my pregnancy. I have other pregnancy videos (Austin, Smith) and they are good, but this one is by far the best. It is harder than the Smith workout,  so do buy one of the easier ones to alternate, but this is a must-have  video for active women who want to keep up their fitness level during their  pregnancy.",955756800,,384,4.305555555555555
590039,5,6303181813,"Keeping my body in shape was very important to me.  I was an individual that was fairly in shape but not one that hit the gym everyday.  Once I got pregnant I tried to go to the gym every day.  I found this to be very  difficult because I was tired all the time.  I then purchased this tape and  Kathy Smith's preg. workout.  My husband snickered saying I would never use  them.  I kinda figured he was right but I bought them anyway.  I am now 8  months pregnant and I do my aerobics every day!  I am happy to say my body  shape has not changed (with the exception of my belly:).  I found both  videos very easy to do.  There are enough nonverbal cues so you can turn  off the volume and do your aerobics to your favorite CD.  I have suffered  from a hip injury which has got progressively worse throughout the preg.  but it is strangely not bothered by the exercises in these videos.  I  recommend buying two videos so you can alternate them...it keeps them from  getting too mundane day after day!  Very pleased with the results from the  tapes, my energy level is higher, and it makes me feel great that I am  doing something for me and the baby.  Very easy to get in the habit of  switching on these tapes after work!",954374400,22,1222,4.1731601731601735
590040,3,6303181813,"First off the video is recorded on a slow speed (I guess to reduce production cost) so the quality is very bad.  There is general fuzziness overall and flicker as well.  I'm tempted return the tape for this reason.  On the other hand, the content is good.",952300800,2,255,4.382978723404255
590041,5,6303181813,"I ordered this video a couple of months ago.  From the first viewing, I was impressed.  Madeleine Lewis is a wonderful instructor; motivating, energetic, but not ""fake"" or ""overdone"".  The workout  is challenging at a comfortable level; it really works all your muscles.  I  have two other pregnancy workouts; Kathy Smith and Denise Austin.  This  video is my favorite!",950659200,26,369,5.135593220338983
590042,5,6303181813,"I actually received this video as a ""White Elephant"" gift at a Christmas party this year.  Boy am I glad I did!  I was having difficulty controlling my weight gain during this first pregnancy and needed a  consistent workout that was safe for pregnancy.  This video was the key!  Since I started working out with Madeleine Lewis and her other pregnant  friends, my weight gain has greatly decreased.  I can't wait to workout  again and again -- usually 5-6 times a week.  It doesn't get boring.  My  only regret is that I didn't have this video from the beginning of my  pregnancy.  My due date is next week & I am still able to complete the  entire workout.  I would recommend this video to any pregnant woman and  plan to recommend it to my pregnant patients!  Also, I am about to order  Buns of Steel, vol 9 (Post Pregnancy Workout) also with Madeleine Lewis.  Give it a try -- you will feel much better and look better too.  Besides,  it's good for your baby as well!  Go for it!",950054400,38,983,4.374301675977653
590043,5,6303181813,"Madeliene Lewis's workout is my absolute favorite for several reasons.  This workout is very balanced - the moves are varied so your muscles are worked from a variety of angles.  Lewis's routines are complex enough to  remain interesting after months of repeated viewing, but she breaks the  elements down, introducing them one new step at a time so it's easy to keep  up.  Her delivery is energetic, but she completely avoids the  ""cheerleader"" overtones that have put me off several other  aerobics videos.  I also love the toning exercises at the end of the  aerobics portion - especially the abdominal/kegel combination.  In  addition, she begins with the guidelines and precautions for keeping fit  during pregnancy as recommended by ACOG.  This was absolutely the best  pregnancy workout video I've purchased and I happily anticipate trying  other videos with Madeliene Lewis after my baby is born.",949795200,18,904,5.173611111111111
590044,4,6303181813,"I am glad I ordered this tape. Prior to this pregnancy my daughter and I went on many fastpaced walks with our jogging stroller.  This was a great workout that works many areas that I could feel the next day, even with all  the walking.  It is not too hard or too easy.  I enjoyed it and think you  will too!",947635200,10,308,3.9836065573770494
590045,4,6303181813,"I work out at least 5 times a week - weights, walking, etc.  I did so before and all during my pregnancy.  This video has been great for days  that I was too tired to get to the gym.  A great little alternative.  It  has been especially good during the last trimester.  I also intend to do  the workout in the early weeks on my recovery after the baby is born.  I  think it will be a great way to get ready to go back to the gym.  The  workout is easy - especially if you've done aerobic classes in the past.  But that's OK - because you can make your movements bigger in order to get  to the level you need.  I'm not fond of the stops in between sets to check  heartrate and exertion levels.  I think if you are in touch with your body,  you already know when you are in your target zone.  So I keep the remote  control close by and fast forward these spots.  I like watching the women  in the video - it's nice not to be the only pregnant woman working out.  Too bad I'm out here, and they are on the video.  I would suggest this  video to anybody trying to stay in shape while pregnant.  Keep moving.  The  more you do, the better you feel, the easier the pregnancy.",940896000,36,1169,3.986899563318777
590159,4,6303181813,"This is a great tape.  The instructor is encouraging and makes sure you know that your goal isn't to break into a new level of fitness, but to maintain and prepare for birth, which is important to remember while pregnant.  There are also variations of the different exercises to do if you have a lower fitness level.  I don't really like the music, it really dates itself (it was made in the mid 90's.).  I also found the aerobics section too hard for me--being a huge klutz!  I like to do the warmup, go for a brisk walk, and then come back and do the toning section and cooldown! The toning section is intense, but it's short enough that you can push yourself through it and you feel the results.  A definite thumbs up from me! I know my labor and delivery is going to be that much easier because I had this video!",1059350400,,816,4.266233766233766
590160,5,6303181813,"This exercise video offers not only a good workout, but it's also tastefully and modestly done.  The music is instrumental and not even slightly vulgar; the clothing that the women wear isn't nasty (no thongs or anything like that, just leotards and shorts).  This is a great video!",1055894400,2,282,4.854166666666667
590161,5,6303181813,"I have purchased several videos in the last few weeks trying to find the right one and this one is by far THE BEST. I actually feel like I'm exercising! This video is nearly 10 years old but you'd never guess it by the workout routines that are in here. From the warm up to the workout to the toning to the cool down, she covers EVERYTHING and you feel great after doing it! Thank you for making a great pregnancy workout video!!",1052265600,4,429,4.180722891566265
590162,5,6303181813,"This workout is just what I need. It is easy, kind of fun and I don't get bored of using it over and over. If you are in great shape before pregnancy this may be too easy. But for people who were in average shape and just want to maintain some sort of shape without killing themselves I highly recommend this tape.",1051401600,,314,4.080645161290323
590163,4,6303181813,"I would recommend this tape.  It flows nicely with the warm-up, aerobics, strengh-training and cool down.  The aerobics are easy to follow yet fun.  I know the tape is called Buns of Steel, but it would have been nice if they also included some upper body exercises during the strengh-training segment.  The instructor is not annoying and she is easy to follow.",1050537600,,361,4.774193548387097
590164,5,6303181813,"I recently started using this (6 1/2 months) after I couldn't stand going to the gym any longer...(most of the aerobic equipment has started to become uncomfortable to use, as I have gotten bigger...)  I am a big workout video fan, and I really like this--it is challenging, allows for adaptation to your comfort level, and includes a toning segment, which I really like.",1049760000,,371,4.796875
590165,5,6303181813,"I had been using the Denise Austin pregnancy workout tape, but I was exercising so much I needed some variety.  This workout provides a great challenge, yet it's easy to ""tone it down"" if you're working too hard.  I especially appreciated the toning segment at the end.  Another thing I really like about this tape is that the background music fades into the background!  With the Denise Austin tape, I was fighting those cheesy tunes for weeks!  I do prefer the relaxation segment at the end of Denise's tape - this cool down seems really short compared with that.  But otherwise, this tape is easy to follow, the moves are actually pretty fun to do, and it's not wimpy!",1040601600,5,671,4.5966386554621845
590166,5,6303181813,I was in very good shape before my pregnancy and was afraid that this would be too easy but it was my first pregnancy and I loved this video from about 4 months on. I always felt good and never uncomfortable. My baby was low and pushing down hard (ended up being ten pounds) for most of the later months and this video never made me feel like I was exerting too much energy or pressure. I recommend for almost anyone!!,1031788800,4,418,4.172839506172839
590167,5,6303181813,"As someone who is prone to gaining a little weight, I knew I would need to stay fit during my pregnancy.  This video is a little less goofy than the other ones out there, such as Denise Austin's and Kathy Smith's (though I used those pregnancy workouts from time to time in order to keep things interesting) and it helps keep your body strong.  In addition to doing the tapes about 3-4 times a week, I walked once or twice a week, did some very MILD weight-lifting once a week, and did a pregnancy yoga tape once a week.  Well, I gained exactly 35 pounds during my pregnancy, had an easy delivery and I lost all the weight in only 10 weeks without starving myself. Best part...I felt healthy.",1029888000,2,692,4.348837209302325
590168,5,6303181813,"This is a great video to use during pregnancy.  I did the whole video up til the 8th month.  Then when I started getting more uncomfortable, I skipped the aeorbics portion (did warm up only) and forwarded to the leg workout - felt really good and my legs stayed in shape.",1027900800,2,271,4.294117647058823
590179,2,6303181813,"I found this video difficult to follow and I got too discouraged to try it again after two or three times at it. This is a pretty traditional aerobic workout routine. The problem was that it involved a lot of quick footwork in sometimes complex combinations, and just as the instructor got going on a new series of steps the camera would zoom in on her face so that I couldn't even see her feet at all! This left me standing there waiting for the camera to pan back out to a wider shot, which totally interrupted the flow of my workout.",1027036800,,536,4.264705882352941
590180,5,6303181813,"This is the GREATEST video for pregnancy that I've found! I always felt like I had just the right workout! Not too tough and not to easy. I recommend it to all my pregnant friends! If I get pregnant again, I'll certainly use this workout.",1025136000,,238,4.311111111111111
590181,5,6303181813,"I started using this tape when I was 5 months along; I'm now at 7 months. I really like this workout.  The music is catchy without being annoying, and the instructor is lively but not too bubbly. It took me a few times to really get the routine down, but that makes it a good workout and not boring.  There's a lot of focus on kegel exercises and abdominal and leg toning.",1012867200,6,372,4.152777777777778
590182,5,6303181813,"I was able to keep up my normal exercise routine until my 7th month and then in desperation to do something aerobic, I bought this video. It would have bored me the first couple of trimesters, but by the third, it was just right. Excellent cueing, very easy to learn and follow. The music is not annoying, and the instructor is friendly without being cloying so that repeated viewing did not get tedious. I did this right up until I gave birth, and I think it really did help me to keep feeling good (or at least let me feel less like a beached whale!). By the way, Buns of Steel #9 is also excellent and I recommend getting it and viewing it before you give birth so that you can start with it right away. Very very good tips for getting your belly back in to its normal position.",1004313600,8,781,4.213333333333333
590183,5,6303181813,"I loved this video.  It was fun and easy to do and the instructor is terrific!  It gave me a lot of energy and strength which really helped during labor.  It was also very relaxing and great for the aching bones, especially my back!  Excellent for moms-to-be!!!  :)",1001894400,,265,4.4375
590184,2,6303181813,"I love to exercise, but am not a big fan of aerobics videos. I bought this b/c it was recommended as a good way to keep in shape throughout your pregnancy. Overall, I found the moves not physically challenging (except maybe for coordination), and the music irritating. I'm sure the instructor is much better in person, but the video performance lacks realism in her personality. It's a nice idea, but save your money and take a prenatal yoga class instead!",1000771200,3,456,4.7125
590185,5,6303181813,I highly recommend this video.  Maeleine Lewis is a great instructor and keeps me motivated.  I like all the routines and they are fun to do.,996624000,,141,4.384615384615385
590186,2,6303181813,"I was disappointed in this video.  I have been a fan of the Buns of Steel tapes for years and expected the same type of workout (only modified) out of this one.  I guess I was expecting more of a leg/buns workout and this was mostly light aerobics and ""some"" leg work.  I think if you are looking for a light aerobics tape for pregnancy, then this is a good one.  I do like the instructor.  But, for those of you who are used to the Buns of Steel series and expect a lower body workout, you may be disappointed too.  (Hey, it says BUNS of steel!!)",991785600,,547,4.065420560747664
590187,4,6303181813,"I am in my 2nd trimester and have enjoyed this video. this video is fun and easy to follow, a bit on the easy side, but the toning section is excellent. great for those who don't have a lot of time to exercise. Upbeat and good for those of us in the moderately fit range.",991526400,,271,3.9454545454545453
590228,1,6303181813,"I am seven months pregnant and tried this video for the first and last time a few weeks ago. I am not terribly fitness savvy and found the steps so incredibly irritating!  I was concentrating so hard I was falling over my own feet.  The videography was done in such a way that they would be changing steps, but only showing arms.  This was most frustrating to me.  I found Redbook's Pregnancy Video so much more pleasant.",990489600,,421,4.428571428571429
590229,5,6303181813,"I have been doing this video for 2 weeks and love it! It is a nice combination of low-impact aerobics and toning that will leave you feeling great. To add extra intensity, I use ankle weights for the toning at the end and do my own ""warm-up"" with light dumbells for the upper body in the beginning. I have noticed comments that it could be ""longer"" but if you have a busy schedule, 40 minutes is a good length, especially if you work.
I have been working out for over 10 years and during pregnancy I think it is important to continue excercising, but not to over-do. This video can be easily enhanced early in pregnacy for extra intensity and will last throughout by maintaining a level that is comfortable for you at every stage. Along with all of the other maternity ""essentials"" - this video should rank near the top of the list.",981936000,7,832,4.409090909090909
590230,4,6303181813,"I'm in my 7th month of pregnancy, and I juggle this video with Kathy Smith's workout, Yoga Zone's Postures for Pregnancy, and walking my dog. I tend to pick up this video a little more often than Kathy Smith's, because it seems to move a bit faster and the routines are more interesting. The workout is easy to follow and not too demanding, if you're in decent shape. In fact, I felt like it wasn't demanding enough until the last few weeks, so I think I'll be using it more and more until the end of my pregnancy. I do wish the aerobics routines went a little longer and that there was an upper-body toning exercise, but she does spend some time working out the legs and rear-end, and that's been helpful. The instructor isn't annoying, either, which is a real plus when it comes to exercise videos.",976233600,23,800,4.412162162162162
590231,3,6303181813,"This is my third pregnancy and I bought this video in an attempt to combat those dreaded pregnancy pounds! I was very excited and couldn't wait to start.  Everything started out well and I was just getting into the groove when Madeleine broke out the complicated steps.  I tried my hardest to follow her, but she just went too fast for me. She tries to break down each mini-routine into several steps, but she only shows you once and then expects you to graps it right away.  Then as soon as you are just beginning to get it, she moves on to the next mini-routine. This is a nice video, but not for someone who is uncoordinated (aren't we all when we're pregnant?) or who hasn't had much experience in an aerobics class.  I am now looking for something more repetitive!",971481600,4,769,4.432624113475177
590232,5,6303181813,"The Buns of Steel Pregnancy Workout is a great workout throughout your pregnancy.  I started using the video in my 5th month and am still using it into my 8th. It challenges you with over exerting you. I previously did  aerobics at the gym, but was unable to continue after I became pregnant.  This has been a perfect substitute.  Sometimes if I need a harder workout I  may hold hand weights while doing portions of the video.  You definitely  feel and notice the difference in the back of your legs.  I highly  recommend this video.",961545600,12,534,4.536842105263158
590233,5,6303181813,"I wanted a different workout video than what I had for my first pregnancy.  So I read the reviews and bought this video. I love to workout my legs, but this video also is great for an entire body workout. This video WILL  KEEP YOU IN SHAPE during your pregnancy. Have fun!",958435200,3,272,4.211538461538462
590234,2,6303181813,"I guess I'm one of the few people here who found the production quality and camera shots used in this video to be of such poor quality that they really detracted from the overall workout.
In addition to the lousy  production values, I wouldn't call the workout moderately rigorous.  I  wasn't expecting a high impact aerobic workout, but I did want to feel my  muscles working over a sustained period of time, not in 10 second blips.  My feeling is that if you're someone who is just starting a workout  program, this video might be for you.  But if you are used to higher levels  of exertion and strength training, I think you may be disappointed.",958348800,,648,4.525862068965517
590235,5,6303181813,"I recently gave birth to my third child. Although I remained active during my other two pregnancies, mainly by following a daily walking routine, this last pregnancy was the first time I actually worked out.  I began using  this video during my seventh month.  I would alternate between several  different pregnancy workout videos, inlcuding Kathy Smith's, Denise  Austin's and an old one sanctioned by Dr. Art Ulene.  Buns of Steel was  certainly the most interesting and engaging workout video I found.  Best  yet, my delivery was by far the easiest and least complicated one I had  ever experienced.  I am completely convinced that the focus on  strenghtening the pelvic floor muscles is the reason why I only pushed for  10 minutes, as opposed to the 2+ hours push-a-thons I experienced with my  other two children!  Plus, I recovered much more quickly this time around,  and I know it is because I worked-out to this video every other day during  my third trimester.
I think this video is wonderful, as I do the Buns of  Steel post-pregnancy workout video I am currently following.  I would  strongly recommend it to any pregnant woman who is looking for a fun,  relatively easy way to get into shape!",956620800,80,1206,4.813725490196078

7840334,5,6303181813,"I absolutely love this video.  I am a very active person and usually get bored really easily by workout videos. I especially hate it when the choreography is repetitive and boring.

I have to say, this video was my best friend during my pregnancy. I used it one time a week through all of my tri-mesters and felt great every time. Yes...the music is cheezy and hair styles on the women are totally 80's..but it is such a comfortable video for pregnant women that it makes up for it.

As a tip, sometimes I would turn on other music while I did the video just to change up the music because I started getting sick of it toward the end.

But overall I really recommend this video (especially over the Fit Mama video which I thought was deathly boring during the yoga section).",1131408000,2,774,4.391608391608392
7840335,5,6303181813,"When I was looking for a way to keep doing aerobics, I turned naturally to Kathy Smith, whose tapes I have been doing for years.  But the reviews editorially and from the customers were so bad, I didn't want to take a chance.  I also do a lot of Buns of Steel work outs from the 90s, and so when I saw there was a pregnancy tape, I decided to give it a try.  The moves are fun and she adds on so you don't get bored.  She also does a section of lunges, squats and some stomach work.  I think it is a great 40 minutes.  Plus the people in the video are really pregnant!!!

I don't advise this for anyone that wasn't in great shape before getting pregnant, but I am 6 months pregnant and still doing a Firm DVD work out (I am forgetting the name, but the main instructor is blond and the DVD is very new and high end), which for some reason, mixes low impact, squats, weights, some kickboxing and all so well, I never get winded and feel so good that I am still able to do more aggressive work outs.  I do wear a stomach belt, though, as you have to be careful of your back and your belly hanging out without contracting your stomach muscles.  I will probably stop though when I hit 3rd trimester.",1114992000,,1195,4.072649572649572

It contains a warm up, followed by 3 aerobic songs, then a pretty good leg section (better than Kathy's) followed by some abdominal strengthening and a cool down. I worked out a lot before pregnancy and even though this may not be as challenging as I would like, I do it a couple of times a week for a change. It does energise and tone and keeps you feeling healthy and fit during pregnancy.",1085011200,3,556,4.407766990291262

I think this tape has a good combo of Aerobics and toning, although I would have liked a little more leg work. It is alot like Kathy Smiths tape, but I think it is less goofy, which I like. It's more geared for adult women (which even though we are pregnant we still are!). The only reason I still use Kathy's tape is because she has more all over work, not just legs. I was in pretty good shape before pregnancy, working out 6 times a week 1 hour a day, and eventhough this is less of a work out, I still feel like I am working. I even reached my hartrate goal.
