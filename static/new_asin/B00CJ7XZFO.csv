5724364,4,B00CJ7XZFO,"I first saw New Dominion Tank Police on cable TV; I think it was on Starz in the mid-late 90's... I believe it was dubbed in English then, as I remember the typically bad voice overs, which were over-acted and lacked symmetry. Although not initially impressed with this short series, I came back to it after rewatching the older, feature-length ""Dominion Tank Police"" from 1988 and Appleseed OVA of the same year. There's something about the world of Masamune Shirow that intrigues me beyond the shallow anime depiction of his work. This is not necessarily a bad manga adaptation- Shirow was directly responsible for its creation, and intended it as a sequel to the manga. The atmosphere of the show is enjoyably ridiculous (made so partially by the 'puma sisters' antics along side the tank police), and puts a light-hearted spin on an otherwise dark storyline. Viewers who have seen the original Dominion Tank Police will note that this series does follow elements of the same vein, though I think most will find the older feature superior in its dialogue and overall flow. I recommend fans of 80's and 90's anime give ""New Dominion"" a Saturday/Sunday morning viewing along side ""Dominion Tank Police"" to appreciate the differences, and to enjoy the fun, nostalgic nature of the show. Please note that although the original U.S. publisher of this show did release the DVD's with an English voice track option, this release only has the original Japanese dub with English soft subtitles.",1428192000,3,1488,4.956

5724368,2,B00CJ7XZFO,"When I was younger I happen to be up later on night and caught this cartoon called Tank Police on cable tv. It blew my mind! It was the coolest cartoon I had ever seen, and it began my enjoyment of Anime and from that moment I had been searching for The New Dominion:Tank Police on video/dvd. Fast forward to the present, I had finally found it, placed my order and was super pumped! That was until I discovered that this set is NOT dubbed in English. Although the description says it is and has English subtitles, the audio is Japanese with or without English subtitles.
It was a huge let down for me. All this time I thought I had finally found what I think to be one of the best cartoon series ever, action packed, and totally kickass! Then to find out this copy was not dubbed in English, it just killed the whole experience... Mainly because you can't enjoy the artwork, or the action because your trying to read all the subtitles. And the voice acting is very annoying!!! Everyone sounds like teenagers especially the female characters.
Everything else is exactly how I remembered it. But it's really hard to enjoy while reading... That's the only drawback.",1378598400,12,1163,4.542857142857143
