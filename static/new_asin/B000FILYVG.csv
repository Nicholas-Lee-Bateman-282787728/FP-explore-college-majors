2568595,5,B000FILYVG,"As a recent convert to fly fishing, this is one of the most visually stunning videos out there on our sport.  Who would not get jacked up by monster brooks and huge sea-run browns?  These guys are hard-core and excellent anglers.",1201219200,,229,4.560975609756097
2568596,5,B000FILYVG,Just wait until you see the wild trout slurpping up the dry flies and leaping to get away!,1179705600,,90,4.055555555555555
2568597,5,B000FILYVG,"Loved the first DVD and still enjoy watching it.

But Amazon where is Trout Bum Diaries Volume 2, its out and should be on the DVD list.",1175904000,,136,4.037037037037037
2568598,5,B000FILYVG,This is a great fly fishing video. Finally a group of people who aren't scared to show nothing but great fishing footage and none of the tecnique stuff. This is a great video for the srious fly fisherman who is interested in seeing what fishing adventures have to offer. Great movie all around and the scenery is amazing. cant beat it. Pure entertainment all over.,1171411200,,364,4.615384615384615
2568599,4,B000FILYVG,"jaw-dropping scenery in varied locations-- from monster brookies in a primordial forest, to five lb. brown and brook trout in spring creeks as wide as my pinky finger on the high-altitude steppes, to giant rainbows in mountainside lakes, to sea run browns, this video covers argentina....  amazing footage set to rockin music- you'll love every minute of it if you fly fish..... and there's lots of it-- two parts to the movie and an extra hour and half or so of bonus footage which may as well be an extra part of the movie.....

i would caution the non-flyfisher from purchasing this, though, as nice as the scenery is.....  there's very little talking whatsoever, aside from the occasional chuckle after landing a monster or brief discussion about their broken-down jeep.... it's basically fish-porn in the purest sense- a warren-miller version of the fly-fishing world in an astounding setting......

only complaint would be that very lack of dialogue and character development..... even in a warren miller movie you get a sentence or two about the featured skiers..... here, their names pop up on screen in a reservoir dogs-type intro sequence and then it's off to the fishing- no discussion of where they are from, favorite fly, fishing background, etc.....

maybe on the next installment in new zealand due in feb. we'll find out more about who these guys are; or perhaps they just want to be known as trout bums and shirk celebrity at all costs....  either way they make a very nice video- a welcome, youthful change in the world of fly fishing..... and either way i'll buy it.....",1167868800,2,1589,4.888475836431227
2568600,3,B000FILYVG,"This DVD has some really good fly fishin action, but its to long for watching it, great for having it at the fly fishing shop, but not really to look at home . It has the potencial to be a great video just 15-20 min. with the best shots.

2568601,5,B000FILYVG,"I was tired of watching videos of boring old men droning on in what seems more like an infomercial for some particular lodge than anything remotely entertaining. Trout Bum Diaries categorically breaks that tired mold and breathes new life into a previously stagnant genre of fly fishing entertainment. The upbeat tempo, high octane action shots and killer soundtrack are more reminiscent of an extreme ski video than the typically insipid fishing video. This ain't your grandpa's fly fishing video! And of course, the intense scenery and HUGE trout of Patagonia are the real attraction.  Even for the non-fisherman, the raw, visceral beauty of Patagonia and the unalloyed enthusiasm in which the bums pursue their passion makes this video a must have. For those of us poor saps who can't escape the office to spend 5 months doing nothing but fishing, camping in the dirt and drinking wine, this is ultimate in vicarious pleasure. You can almost feel the adrenaline yourself when they hook into a monster trout. I've already watched this a dozen times and it's just as entertaining the 12th time as it was the first. Now if only I can make it to Patagonia myself.........",1151020800,7,1170,4.939086294416244
2568602,5,B000FILYVG,"Like title said, this is a diary, a documentary type of film. All true setting- sleep in the dirt, fishing in the rain, car accident... If you like advanture and always wondering what is the spirit of the true advanture. This is the film for you. Besides of the beautiful landscape of the South Ameriaca, there are also lots of shots of "" behind the scene"" which is my favorite part of this film. If you love fly fishing, you definately don't want to miss this video. HUGE trout with awesome color. Can tell you that, they are awesome fly fishermans. I literally watch this film more than 20 times since I got it from last Christmas. Hopefully the second volume is coming soon. Two thumbs up!",1148601600,4,692,4.456692913385827
2568603,5,B000FILYVG,"If you love fly fishing or extreme travel adventures, this is the video for you.  These young lions of fly fishing have blazed a new trail in travel adventure.  What they have done is comparable to what Warren Miller did for skiing.  So what if you aren't into fly fishing.  The wilderness of Patagonia is all there for you feast your eyes upon.  And these boys go deep into it all in hell-blazing glory.  If you're into fly fishing, well, the romance of ""A River Runs Through It"" will look like the philosophical examination of Presbyterian grace that it is--that is, right after you get muddied by the insane, jaw-dropping, heart-stopping adventures of AEG's Trout Bums Diaries.  This is travel adventure at its very best.",1147910400,9,724,4.744

8123417,4,B000FILYVG,"Documentary with lots of action, well filmed and cheerful. Video highly recommended to fly-fish for trout in splendid nature environment. Very good.",1401494400,,148,5.7727272727272725
8123418,5,B000FILYVG,"great flick, if you are into fly fishing, Ive wacthed it probally 10 times and still gets me wanting to plan my own patigona trip !!!",1380931200,,133,4.153846153846154
8123419,3,B000FILYVG,"The video is very interesting, with wonderful footage of catching fish. I was glad I watched, but thought the video could have been much more. I was disappointed that there was almost no INFORMATION. I could seldom tell exactly where they were, they did not describe what permissions, if any, they needed to fish in specific areas, they did not discuss gear, etc. They did show many of the flies they used. I was curious about costs (they mentioned they did not fish private waters that cost 300 US dollars per day). How did they buy their jeep? What roads were they on? How did they arrange camping? Under what conditions did they use nymphs vs dry flies vs streamers? What US fly patterns worked? What new patterns did they learn about? How did they learn about them? And so forth. In summary, I recommend the video, but if you view it, expect to have many unanswered questions. Be sure to watch the bonus section. It seemed to have a bit more narration. I want to go to Patagonia.",1358812800,,983,4.4972067039106145
8123420,3,B000FILYVG,"After seeing the trialer on YouTube and reading some of the reviews here, I gave it a go. Sadly, it doesn't really live up to the hype. There is some good fishing here and there, but it's an agony to sit through. And I would have liked to see more of the actual travel stuff along the way--that's part of the fun of a travelogue for me.

This is hardly fast-paced action, so don't think it's going to have you on the edge of your seat. Over priced for what it delivers I'd say.",1335225600,,477,4.074468085106383
8123421,2,B000FILYVG,"I hate to disagree with the previous poster, but I found this video very disappointing.
You learn nothing about the techniques or strategies used, you do not get to know the members at all, you learn nothing of the logistics of the trip, nothing about the fly's or equipment used, etc.
Yes, the constant mechanical breakdowns were interesting to see, and these guys (who all seem like nice guys, by the way) sure can fish, but I left with absolutely nothing from this film.  Also, I thought the film quality itself was poor.
To be honest, I'm shocked at how much I really disliked it and found it to be waste of my time.  I thought I'd come away with something from it.

last night I watched the second  one ""Kiwi Camo"" and found it much more enjoyable and informative.  (overall better quality)",1265328000,3,795,4.531468531468532
8123422,5,B000FILYVG,"As soon as my husband and I finished watching this movie we wanted to go to the Patagonia soooo bad! These are the best videos of fishing ever! Get this one and Kiwi Camo, the Mongolia one, I hate to say was really disappointing. But get this one for sure!!",1253664000,4,257,4.16
8123423,2,B000FILYVG,"As with their New Zealand DVD, they fail to divulge where they are at any time. Am left wondering what the point of the film is . . . to show off their fly fishing skills?  So what? Where exactly did they catch those monster trout?  And I disagree with the comment about the soundtrack. Boring and inappropriate to the ""action"" on the screen.  Definitely not worth the $27--$5.00 maybe.",1246665600,,386,4.485714285714286
8123424,4,B000FILYVG,"Great video for those off season days, or for remembering those fond trips of your own to this great area.",1212883200,,106,4.35
8123425,5,B000FILYVG,"Even though John Gierach is correct, fly fishing just isn't a spectator sport, this video erodes that theory bigtime!  I got this video toward the end of a harsh and cold and frozen winter here in central Washington, this video was the only thing that kept me sane, and hopeful that the snow would melt and the fish would once again rise.  If you don't have it, get it, if you already have it....stop reading this and go watch it...unless the fish are biting, then go outside and catch the real thing.  Bottom line, I dig the video and will watch it many many times, but really, I like fishing more...and the AEG would hopefully agree.",1210464000,,635,4.456896551724138
