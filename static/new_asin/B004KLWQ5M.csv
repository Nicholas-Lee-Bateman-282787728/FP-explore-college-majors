8433107,5,B004KLWQ5M,"I love PANDORA HEARTS.
I actually like the anime better than the manga, acually.
Anyway, This is pretty big and takes up a lot of space. However, if your a fan of the PANDORA HEARTS anime, then you'll want to get this.
In fact, youd regret not getting it.
If you got Volume one then you'll definately want Volume two.
Oh, and if you like the art book, it comes with that to.

Ahh... if your hesitating because you don't know if theres a region coding or not, let me put your mind at ease. You can play these DVDs in America.",1430697600,,524,4.137254901960785

For those of you have who have watched the first of the show the second half is just as strong. There a few moments when you feel like you're about to lose interest but then the plot takes a clever twist and you are hooked all over again.

The character development in this show I fell in love with, if you're a fan of a good story and seeing characters grow then this is a must for you, the story is very character driven and that makes it that much better.

What's amazing about these premium editions is the collectors book they come with, it comes loaded with goodies for die hard fans.

Just as the first one it is subbed in English, but as before, I prefer the Japanese voice actors much better.

The series does end on a cliff hanger which begs for a season 2, though as of now, nothing is in the works, I guess we can only hope.

Pandora Hearts is a must buy, one of the greatest shows I have gotten into, I have fallen in love with it.

(On a side not there is a total of 25 episodes in the series, vol 2. goes up to episode 25, not 24.)",1304208000,3,1216,3.959016393442623
