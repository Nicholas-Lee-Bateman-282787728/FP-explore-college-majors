8131519,5,B000GFSYDE,"I actually found this video brand new unopened at a Goodwill store.  I have gotten into listening to relaxing piano music as a way to unwind after work.  I also play relaxation music for my students, and they really do enjoy it.  I have not watched this video all the way through yet, but checked random spots throughout, and I have to say I love what I've seen so far.  The DVD is unnarrated, so it is only the relaxing music and sounds of nature from the locations shown.  The scenery is breathtaking and the music is not overly distracting from the nature scenes.  If you enjoy this sort of thing, I think you'll like it.",1475971200,,624,4.336206896551724
