4208135,4,B003V5R0QS,"This DVD is great! I was a dancer years ago && this helped me to get back in the ""swing"" of things. The exercises are wonderful and it's truly an AB workout! This DVD has four or five combination moves. The first two are for beginners but in all honesty, you've got to already know how to ""work the pole"" a little to get the others! Overall, I love it! I'd recommend this for beginners and intermediate pole users! #satisfiedcustomer",1301961600,8,433,4.425
4208136,5,B003V5R0QS,"I am advanced now and have been through a fair lot of videos. I think this video is exciting, it offers a lot of variety and there is very good stripper warm up, which includes some wonderful floor work, VERY SEXY (stripper push ups, hip circes, knee circles on the floor alternating with straddles and a lot more). There is 5 combo on it, one of them includes a head stand but it is really good because it prepares you to balance pole with your legs for your future intermediate and advanced moves. It is fun to do and it teaches basic spins and other transitions and moves. A good buy. Her other two in the series are also superb quality. leigh anne teaches you how to flow, so the dancing is not disjointed which is great.",1295913600,9,725,4.299270072992701
4208137,5,B003V5R0QS,"I personally think that this line of DVDs is the best out there, I have gotten a couple DVDs out of the art of pole series as well however, i find that leigh ann's series is more fun and helps you learn new moves through combinations.

to make it simple,

this DVD series teaches you to actually dance, gives you 5 combos on each dvd, which at first doesnt seem like much but it really helps you to learn transitioning, and helps to inspire you to put whatever moves together that you please, she teaches as if you were in the studio with her.

I feel learning moves in a routine eliminates the roughness of learning all the moves indiviually then trying to put them together smoothly. She makes the entire experience fun and sexy, as well as extremely challening, def. a workout.

I would reccommend this to everyone with a pole!",1295395200,15,830,4.440789473684211
8406429,4,B003V5R0QS,It was slightly scratched and skipped a bit. Nothing that stalled it for more than a second. The production quality is low. Personally  it doesn't bother me in the least the girls are view able and the sound is just fine. This is very much a beginner DVD but the combos are very nice to have. I have the art of pole and Felix Canes DVD sets but I like the combos on this dvd. I feel like I'm finally dancing not just learning a move.,1456790400,,433,4.034883720930233
8406430,4,B003V5R0QS,It's a descent Dvd. Def for a individual who has all the basic moves Down and is ready to put them together while learning some new moves.  This DVD will take you from beginner to intermediate level.,1426377600,,199,4.378378378378378
8406431,5,B003V5R0QS,"This is an amazing workout. I have just begun my adventure with pole dancing but have been Leigh Ann's fan for quite some time. What I love about this DVD is that it teaches you not only basic moves, but also how to gracefully transition between moves and combos to create beautiful routines. There is a lot of dancing involved, this is incorporated into almost every aspect of the workout.
For example, the dvd starts with a sexy walk, and a floor workout,  both of which are important elements of pole dancing.

The workout is not an easy one but that is to be expected if you have little or no experience and are, like me, out of shape. :)",1407283200,,642,4.341666666666667
8406432,2,B003V5R0QS,"This DVD is for experienced dancers who want to learn how to pole dance. The level of flexibility and strength exhibited by the dancers in the video could not be replicated by the average person. One of the sequences includes a head stand, hardly beginner stuff. And the dancers are all wearing very high stiletto heels. It does not break down basic steps. That is done better on youtube. I should have tried to sample the dvd on youtube before I wasted my money.

Hopefully after I have learnt a few basics I can get some use from this video.",1383868800,3,543,4.43
8406433,4,B003V5R0QS,"This video was really helpful re: the importance of being ""sexy,"" warming up, & cooling down. The combos were much more helpful than anything I've seen on youtube, because they demonstrated much more ""flow"" that just pole trick, by pole trick, by pole trick.",1367625600,,258,4.886363636363637
8406434,5,B003V5R0QS,Working very hard on it----Great DVD for the beginner-intermmedate-have learned many moves.. Hopefully will get to the advanced one of these days;),1359849600,,147,5.7272727272727275
8406435,4,B003V5R0QS,Man if I could move my body the way she does!!  She is very sexy with her moves.  I was surprised for a beginner dvd that she has some of the moves on here.  She explained and showed pretty well.,1349481600,,195,3.825
8406436,2,B003V5R0QS,"This was not very informative and did not teach steps very well. It may be better for someone who has more experience, but for me, it was a waste. It arrived on time and was packaged well.",1326931200,3,188,4.108108108108108
8406437,1,B003V5R0QS,I wasn't at all impressed by this DVD. It lacks quality and professionalism. This DVD was like 30 something dollars.. It was not worth it! I read all the other reviews and I was really excited about it but as soon as I put it in I was very dissatisfied. It just looks really raunchy. I was expecting something more out of the production quality.,1310428800,2,345,4.323076923076923
8406438,5,B003V5R0QS,got this for my girlfriend.  she loved it.  may get the next one some day.  good business,1302566400,,89,4.117647058823529
