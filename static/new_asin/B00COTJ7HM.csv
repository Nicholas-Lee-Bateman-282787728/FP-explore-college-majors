However, this is a good video for both beginner and advanced students. I have gone over it a few times now and have added a few of these drills to my own Arnis system.

Although everyone i spoke to was very open and willing to resolve the issue, i felt as though the process for return should have been more simplistic. I just wanted another video not money back. Overall, amazon is still good to order through.",1376006400,,302,4.611111111111111
