8284534,4,B001BSBBEY,"The movie starts out in Switzerland, 1942, occupied by the Nazi forces. An old man enters a hotel cafe with a load of books. He joins two Gestapo agents at a table and offers them books for sale: ""Here are the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, an old German writer.""

But it's a ruse, they are actually discussing plans, and the old man continues, ""Orders from Berlin. Dr. Tobel must be across the border at dawn.... The English schweinhunt will try to take Dr. Tobel from under our very eyes. They are sending a stupid bungling amateur detective. His name is Holmes, or some such foolishness.""

Why do both sides want Tobel? Because he has developed a new bomb site which will revolutionize air warfare. Will the British get Tobel to England. Will they also get his bomb site prototype, split into four packages for safety?

This is the 4th movie where Basil Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes, with Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. It has been modernized to take place in the 1940s. It came out in 1942 and is only 68 minutes long. This has a spy story aspect to it that is not as successful as the regular mystery plottings of a Sherlock Holmes story. It is still entertaining; it's just not the best in the series.

You get two versions of the movie, colorized and the original black & white. I don't bother watching the colorized version, but that's just my preference. The only Bonus Feature is the original trailer for the movie. Unfortunately, this movie release has no subtitles.

""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon"" is included in a collection of all 14 of the Sherlock films which Rathbone made with Bruce,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B000EXZFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>.  Subtitles are available If you watch Secret Weapon in the Collection. The Collection does not, however, include a colorized version of the movie.

I am a fan of many film and TV iterations of Sherlock Holmes, and that includes the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock series. My favorite quote from this movie is by Moriarty: ""I was looking for something ingenious. This is ingenuous.""

8284535,5,B001BSBBEY,"Love the ""colorized"" Sherlock Holmes.  Like seeing them for the first time.  I have the complete Black & White collection with Rathbone and Bruce, but these color versions are fun all over again.

8284540,3,B001BSBBEY,"Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, 1946 film

The film begins in Switzerland. Two men enter a caf, and old man meets them to give them orders. They plan to steal a bombsight from Dr. Franz Tobel. [Did you notice the clue?] Will the spies be fooled by an impersonation? Can they be flown out of the country at night? They arrive safely in London. Mission accomplished? There seems to be some trickery here. [Or a lack of security?] What is Dr. Tobel drawing? Who is after him? Holmes explains his deductions. The bombsight is tested on Salisbury Plain [it looks like the western desert of the USA]. Will it revolutionize aerial bombardment? There are scenes of London. Dr. Tobel wants to work independently without unwanted attention. The bombsight is composed of four parts, each one produced at independent workshops. [Are all telephone calls monitored by a government agency?]

When Dr. Tobel goes missing Sherlock Holmes looks for him while disguised. Holmes finds a person who knows something. Will he walk into a trap? Will Moriarity eliminate Holmes at last? Or will his plot fail? There is a trick to raise the writing from an impression on the paper beneath. Can they decipher the code? What if the men named are dead? ""What is the name of the fourth man?"" Holmes figured out the trick. Will Moriarity? Who has the better plan? ""A keen observation."" ""You've played into my hands."" Will Lestrade and Watson arrive in time? Will Moriarity fall into his own trap for an ironic ending? [What about the sequel?]",1453161600,,1518,4.790076335877862
8284541,5,B001BSBBEY,"A classic must have for Holmes fans. The B/W version has audio issues and does not seem to be ""cleaned up"".  The color version has been fully restored and looks good with good audio.",1440460800,,182,4.352941176470588

8284543,5,B001BSBBEY,"In the fourth film in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes series, the good detective and Dr. Watson are pitted once again against the forces of evil once-again threatening to destroy England.  What is the meaning of these dancing men...?

Legend Films has gone a great service to the classic film lexicon by preserving and updating this treasure from World War II Britain.  After all, Secret Weapon stands out as being one of the few Holmes tales set in the contemporary era, as opposed to some alien, Victorian past.  To what end you might ask?  Why, to challenge the greatest villains in history, the Nazis, of course.  And now, the great detective does so in full color for the first time.

Yes, the plot leaves a little to be desired (having been scantily influenced by Doyle's original writings) and so do the production values, but fans of Holmes will appreciate the ""Easter egg"" references and cameos buried within.  I challenge you find one in particular, a tiny reference to Holmes' cocaine use. '

As is typical with Legend Films releases, the DVD contains both the colorized and the black and white versions of the film, so that you can appease both the kids and the staunch traditionalist in your house.",1227657600,,1208,4.769230769230769
