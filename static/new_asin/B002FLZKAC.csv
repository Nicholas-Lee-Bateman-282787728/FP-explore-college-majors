3922542,5,B002FLZKAC,"My 2 year-old daughter and I couldn't wait for this one to make it to TV, so we borrowed it from our library, and I'm sure glad we did! In the double-length title episode, Dora is once again on a storybook adventure, this time helping to preserve the Crystal Kingdom's beautiful colors by retrieving its four magic crystals from a greedy king. This episode put a lot of emphasis on sharing, always a popular theme for the preschool crowd, and followed the usual format and the same old, beloved cast of characters. My daughter was really excited when the Snow Princess made a few brief appearances, while I greatly enjoyed Richard Kind (Paul from Spin City) doing the voice of the greedy king. I did have to roll my eyes when Dora and Boots got butterfly wings, envisioning the inevitable marketing of butterfly-winged Dora dolls for Christmas, but as my daughter thought that part was ""awesome"" I guess I can't complain too much.

The other two adventures included on this DVD are both great episodes too - one about Boots and Tico's first day of school, and the other a King Midas-like tale about a wish machine that makes bananas drop on Boots' head every time he  says ""bananas."" Overall, a great, fun new Dora DVD!",1254700800,7,1219,4.638888888888889

3922584,4,B002FLZKAC,"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas 2012. Here are my thoughts.

The DVD itself: The number of commercials on the disc is pretty over-the-top. You can't jump straight to the menu, so you have to skip each commercial one-by-one every time you put the disc in. Kind of annoying. The disc holds 3 full Dora episodes: Crystal Kingdom, First Day of School, and Boots' Banana Wish. I wish they used the remaining disc space for an additional episode, rather than advertising for pretty much every preschool DVD Nick has ever released.

Crystal Kingdom: This story is unlike typical Dora episodes, as its full of magic. In a nutshell, the Crystal Kingdom is a story in Dora's book. The greedy king steals the magic crystals that put all the color into the world, and Dora & Boots go into the story to save the day. The crystals are hidden among different stories in the book, and they have to travel through each one to retrieve them. In the end, they find all the crystals and the King learns not to be so greedy.
I like that the story still has a moral, even though its packed full of princesses, dragons, magic butterfly wings etc.
My 3 year old's review of the story: ""DoraBoots save the crystals in Ally's bag to fix the rainbows"" :)

First Day of School: This has become my daughter's favorite Dora episode. I feel its more educational than your average episode, it teaches many more Spanish phrases. Tico the Squirrel is with Dora & Boots the entire time. When they get to school, they sing a bilingual song about introducing yourself.

Boots' Banana Wish: In this story, Boots using a wishing machine to wish for bananas. As a result, every time he says ""bananas"", a bunch falls right on his head. The wishing machine breaks, so he can't reverse the wish. They spend the episode travelling to another wishing machine, with bananas falling on boots the whole time.
I like that this episode teaches kids to be careful what you wish for & to think things through.",1357516800,2,1984,4.564606741573034

3922586,5,B002FLZKAC,"My daughter has loved this particular Dora movie for around 2 years. So about a month ago, I bought the DVD from Amazon for when my children come to visit me for a week next summer. She's going to love being able to watch this again.",1353974400,3,233,4.086956521739131

3922588,4,B002FLZKAC,What can I say? My little girl loves Dora. I actually like this one myself because it has a story. All the other Dora shows are about her following a map and are approximately the same.,1338768000,,185,4.166666666666667
3922589,5,B002FLZKAC,"My four-yr-old loves Dora and this movie is one of her favorites.  One of the best things about this dvd is that it starts on its own after a few ""commercials"".  This has been a real bonus when traveling as no one has to twist and turn in the front seat to push play on the dvd player and my daughter is satisfied that the movie is playing, not only so she can watch it, but also so she can hear the songs.  I often peek at her in the rear-view mirror and she is coloring or looking out the window, singing with the movie. Good movie to own; it has a nice story line and teaches that generosity is much more rewarding and satisfying than greediness.  The characters in the story are fun and interesting: the king, the townspeople, the magician, a knight, a dragon.  Good kid movie. And, Dora and Boots get to fly!! What's not to love about that?!",1280793600,,846,4.197530864197531
