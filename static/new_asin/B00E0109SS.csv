8599684,5,B00E0109SS,"Definitely a unique plot; not your typical hollywood story.  I have seen other films directed by John Gloster, and as usual he delivers a extremely creative film.  There are a few twists as the story unfolds, which keep the viewer in a state of intrigue.  Another reviewer mentioned the plot was slow towards the beginning, but I definitely did not feel the same.

I definitely recommend giving this film a viewing or two.  Enjoy!",1403568000,,430,4.756756756756757
8599685,5,B00E0109SS,"It's a creative, original Independent movie with a great cast filmed in New York City! I recommend this to everyone who like originality, love, sad, and a good twist towards the end.",1396483200,,182,4.71875
8599686,4,B00E0109SS,"This was an interesting film. A guy charging people money to hit him (hence the title). There was some interesting character development with the clients... each with their own issues. The sub-story about the main character (Cameron) dating a girl who wears masks in public was a unique twist. The film is somewhat of a slower-pace in the beginning but picks up around the middle. Excellent acting and good cinematography for an indie film. I'd recommend giving this a watch if you're up for a ""different"" kind of story.",1394409600,,520,4.853932584269663
8599687,3,B00E0109SS,"I wish the sound was better. Totally an indie film - without the usual Hollywood formulaic love story, cliches, etc. .  The concept and idea is great - with a better production value, I think the movie can go really far.  Worth a screening or two.",1382486400,,247,4.3478260869565215
8599688,5,B00E0109SS,"Punch Money is a thoroughly original film which delivers a real world sense of dread and redemption.  There are no cliched suspense tricks here.  Punch Money is one of those movies that stays with you for a long, long time.",1381276800,,223,4.55
8599689,5,B00E0109SS,A young man who needs money for college gets into an unusal business to make money. He becomes a human punching bag for paying customers. Great cast and great directing by John Gloster. Something different than the usual indie filmaking.,1379203200,2,237,4.95
