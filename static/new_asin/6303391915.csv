635077,4,6303391915,"A DOUBLE LIFE proved beyond doubt the quality of Ronald Colman as a screen actor.  As Anthony John, the Broadway star whose characterization of Othello eventually consumes him, he turns in a powerful performance, highlighted by George Cukor's sensitive direction.  He begins the film in his familiar urbane manner, but as the strain of portraying such a role gets the better of him, so he begins to become more hysterical in the delivery of his lines.  Through an intelligent use of voiceover, that compliments the actor's increasingly disheveled appearance, director Cukor shows art and life become totally confused in his mind, as he consciously mistakes the young server Pat Kroll (Shelley Winters) for Desdemona, with tragic consequences.  A DOUBLE LIFE is a visual feast, intelligently photographed by Milton Krasner; the repeated shot of the theater curtain rising and falling - often in shadow - reminds us of how much the stage dominates Anthony's life, as well as signaling the film's denouement.  In a series of two-shots, the shadows keep falling across the faces of the women in Anthony's life - his ex-wife (and costar in the Othello production)) Brita (Signe Hasso), Pat Kroll - suggesting that their lives are somehow fated through association with the star.  Designer Harry Horner's sets are lush yet threatening, the heavy furniture pressing in upon Anthony as he tries to make sense of an increasingly disordered life; there are several close-ups of his face shot against the shadows of the banisters, suggesting imprisonment.  In a strategy that foreshadows a similar technique in THE HEIRESS (1949), also designed by Horner, Anthony is shown climbing stairs, suggesting that he has mental as well as physical levels to contend with.  The fact that he fails in this task draws further attention to his disordered state of mind.  The actual performance of ""Othello"" is somewhat stagy, with the actors standing and declaiming their lines in a conscious evocation of late nineteenth century styles of production.  However this technique gives Cukor the opportunity to focus on the actors in close-up, especially Colman and Hasso, as Hasso realizes (to her horror) that her death-scene as Desdemona might be taking place for real.  A DOUBLE LIFE is a powerful film, showing the lengths to which actors can go to give a truthful performance, and how it can affect their mental state.",1405123200,,2397,5.136246786632391

635082,4,6303391915,"Ronald Colman had one of the most beautiful speaking voices in films. I would have love to have seen him on stage. His was the type of voice that you instantly recognize when you hear it. He wasn't the only one. George Sanders, James Mason, Alec Guiness, Herbert Marshall and Anthony Hopkins are just a few of the others. He brought his remarkable gifted voice and put it to great use in ""A Double Life"" and combined with his superb performance in the title role, won his only Best Actor Oscar. The story is a simple one, illusion vs reality but if it's not handled the right way it has the potential of not succeeding. But Colman and company pull it off under the direction of George Cukor, unfairly labeled a ""woman's director"" his whole career(Clark Gable had David Selznick fire him from directing ""Gone With The Wind"" because he thought he was favoring Vivian Leigh more than him. But that's another story). ""A Double Life"" was an unusual picture for Cukor in that it seems almost a ""Film Noir"" type film. Olive films has just released it on Blu ray and the results are mostly satisfying. The film was restored years ago by the UCLA Film Department and this is the print Olive used in this blu ray upgrade. Some of the exterior shots in the beginning on the New York streets leave much to be desired for blu ray. This is true for some on the dark interior shots too. But that may be due to the age of the film(65 years) and the film elements than the restoration itself. The close ups are stunning on blu ray. You can clearly see some of Colman's pimples(sorry fans) on his face under the make-up. Both Edmund O'Brien and Shelley Winters(future Oscar winners) are superb in their roles as well. Milton Krasner's black & white photography looks equally stunning on Blu-ray(Bitrate: 20.00). Like I said, it's filmed in a film noir style that was popular at the time but not the style that Cukor was known for in his films. If you like seeing and hearing Shakesphere on film then I would recommend the film. If you already own the Republic DVD and are on the fence about upgrading then I'll leave that up to you. You probably don't have to but the blu ray is a lot clearer in certain scenes when compared to the DVD version. I have both versions and there is a difference, however slight, on this Olive blu ray release. If you own Olive's recent Blu rays of ""High Noon"" and  ""Force of Evil"" then this release is certainly on par with those. It's not a perfect blu ray but impressive none the less.",1348617600,,2499,4.444444444444445

635084,5,6303391915,"Universal Pictures presents ""A DOUBLE LIFE"" (1948) (104 min/B&W) -- Starring: Ronald Colman, Signe Hasso, Edmond O'Brien & Shelley Winters

Directed by George Cukor

Anthony John (Ronald Colman) is an actor whose life is strongly influenced by the characters he plays. When he's playing comedy, he's the most enjoyable person in the world, but when he's playing drama, it's terrible to be around him. That's the reason why his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) divorced him; although she still loves him and works with him, she couldn't stand living with him anymore. So when Anthony accepts to play Othello, he devotes himself entirely to the part, but it soon overwhelms him and with each day his mind gets filled more and more with Othello's murderous jealousy.

Won Oscars for Best Actor (Ronald Colman) and for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Mikls Rzsa)

Nominated Oscar for Best Director (George Cukor) and Best Writing, Original Screenplay (Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin)

Not to be overlooked is Milton Krasner's atmospheric cinematography.

Special footnotes:  -- In the film, Ronald Colman plays a fictional actor who stars in the longest-running ""Othello"" in history. In real life, actor Paul Robeson, who had just become the first black actor to star in an otherwise white production of ""Othello"" on Broadway, had just completed the longest run of the play.

The role of Anthony John was originally written for Laurence Olivier. Olivier was unavailable when the film finally went into production.

635085,5,6303391915,"I'm not sure this movie could be made today. It has no blood, no guts, no explosions, no fireballs, no steroid driven males and no women with huge chests. Does it need them? Not by a long shot. It is an absolutely marvelous movie with incredible acting, beautiful black and white film work and a really good story. The screenwriting is absolutely first class as is the movie itself. Ronald Coleman's portrayal of a demented actor truly is an Academy award winning performance. The other actors do a wonderful job as well. Once I started watching this movie. I could not interrupt myself to do anything else. It was riveting! I have loaned it to three or four friends, one of whom almost refuses to see any black and white films. All told, it was rated terrific, including by the black-and-white filmophobe. He said is one of best movies he has ever seen. I heartily recommend this film to anyone who enjoys top-of-the-line films from any era. This one is hard to beat. Does the VHS version bother me?Heck no! One viewing tip--when I watch this I always turn down the brightness of the TV screen a little bit to make the scenes even darker. It seems to make everything even more ominous and hard-hitting.",1303344000,,1203,4.6

635137,4,6303391915,"Director George Cukor strips away the glitter and tinsel of Broadway in the 1947 psychological thriller A DOUBLE LIFE, starring Ronald Colman in the role which finally netted him an Academy Award.

Acclaimed stage actor Anthony John (Ronald Colman) takes up the role he has been dreaming of for years - Shakespeare's diabolical Othello.  Co-starring with his ex-wife Brita (Signe Hasso) as Desdemona, Tony's role starts to take a serious toll on his mental state as the show runs to audience and critical acclaim for many, many months.  Finally, his nerves as brittle as the Bard's dialogue, Tony snaps and kills pretty waitress Pat (Shelley Winters) using his Othello ""kiss of death"" strangle-hold.

Featuring a sharp script from Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, A DOUBLE LIFE was the film that first established Shelley Winters as a promising new star; and while she only features in two relatively brief sequences, her character is the key to Ronald Colman's most amazing acting scene in the entire film.  Gorgeous Swedish actress Signe Hasso lights up the screen as Brita and has a lovely chemistry with Colman.  Edmond O'Brien co-stars as the publicity agent who suspects Tony of murder; also keep your eyes peeled for a young Betsy Blair.

The DVD from Artisan/Republic Pictures features a print that has been independently restored by the UCLA Archive.  While quite serviceable, it does exhibit some telecine wobble and other age-related print damage problems.  I'd love to see Universal release this title with some bonus features and a comprehensive restoration job, but somehow I doubt it will ever happen.  A real pity, because this is one of the all-time best from George Cukor.",1247529600,,1687,5.079710144927536
635138,4,6303391915,"Story about theatre actor who gives himself so fully to the role that he starts to confuse his real life from his stage life.  His only relief from the emotional pain is his love for his ex-wife.  Although divorced, the two are still close firends and colleagues n the Broadway plays.  His ex-wife knows best that he is emotionally fragile and is afraid to marry him again knowing that his emotional baggage will destroy this relationship again.

When he takes on the role of Othello, his fame explodes.  Night after night he plays a doomed lover.  But his psyche starts to crack.  In desparate effort to separate his love for his ex-wife for his love of Desdemona on stage, he commits murder against a young woman, played wonderfully by Shelley Winters.

One has to have a love for old movies to watch this one.  I loved the old black and white shots and the intensity of old school of acting.",1234483200,,894,4.5375
635139,5,6303391915,"A few things came to my mind while viewing ""A Double Life"".  Foremost the film's theme of actors unable to separate roles from reality foreshadowed the recent passing of Heath Ledger.  The liner notes state that Cary Grant turned the role of Anthony John before Ronald Colman accepted it.  No offence to Grant, but I think it a wise decision because I can't see him doing a better job than Colman.  Essentially this a high-brow psychological horror film.  If you like this film it would behoove you to check out the films producer Val Lewton made for RKO or ""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square"" from Fox.  All around this is a first rate production.  One has to start with Colman who gives a performance for the ages.  His character is sympathetic despite the monstrous impulses that lurk beneath his surface.  The script by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon cleverly juxtaposes staged horror with the real thing.  Director George Cukor orchestrates the proceedings with originality and style.  Though ""A Double Life"" pays homage to a maligned genre it's unlike any film I've seen before and should not be missed.",1220227200,,1106,4.829787234042553
635140,5,6303391915,"Ronald Colman was brilliant in his Oscar winning portrayal of deranged yet venerable Broadway actor Anthony John in the George Cukor directed ""A Double Life"".  This psychological thriller based upon a screenplay by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin was a thoughtfully construed play within a play.

Colman was coaxed by Broadway producers played by Philip Loeb and Ray Collins to reprise the role of Othello.  So consumed by the role was Colman that be began to exhibit the jealous and murderous rage of the Shakespearean created Moor in his real life.  After almost strangling his ex-wife and leading lady Brita played by Signe Hasso while acting on stage, he suffered a serious break from reality.

In a fit of jealousy inspired by his press agent Bill Friend played by Edmond O'Brien's affection for Hasso he goes on a rampage.  He visits waitress Pat Kroll played by a buxon and sultry Shelley Winters, a gal he had a thing with previously.  Totally withdrawn from his senses, he strangles her in the same manner that Othello dispatches Desdemona in the play.

As Hollywood justice dictated in the 40's, Colman is made to pay for his crimes in a thrilling conclusion as O'Brien becomes suspicious that Colman was the murderer and contacts the police.

Colman's Academy Award was justly deserved as he demonstrated his proficiency not only as a well schooled Shakespearean actor but also in the role of the delusional Anthony John.  Miklos Rosza's musical score also garnered him an Oscar in star studded flick.",1199750400,,1509,4.928853754940712
635141,4,6303391915,"A PLACE IN THE SUN, THE GREAT GATSBY, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, LOLITA, POSEIDON ADVENTURE: the list of films in which Shelley Winters dies young  (orrelatively young or at least not quite yet ready for the home) goes on and on.  What does that say about poor Shelley-Also-Known-As-Shirley?  Well, I'm not sure, frankly.  But I do know this movie preceded them all, and although I can't say for sure that it was the very first film in which she croaked, it's hard to imagine her doing any better job of it than she does here.  At least in this one, she didn't end up all waterlogged.

But seriously, this is the film most often cited as Winters' breakthrough, despite the fact that she was a screen veteran by this point with 20 parts under her belt.  It's not insignificant that the packaging of this DVD features her more prominently than the nominal female lead, the dignified but not very flashy Signe Hasso.  Her ""tough talkin' blonde from the wrong side of the tracks"" was as close to archetypal as you could get.  She didn't get a lot of screentime and a good deal of that was spent getting strangled, BUT she invested her character Pat Kroll with sufficient humanity that you couldn't help feel compassion for her and bemoan her fate.

The movie's lead was, of course, an aging Ronald Colman, whose star turn here as fading stage actor (fading more into insanity than oblivion, actually) got him a belated Oscar.  Many contemporary viewers of this film might find that surprising.  It's a meaty enough role, but by current standards at least, a bit on the hammy side.  It's written that way: it's hardly the actor's fault.  But if you're anything like me, you almost sure to cringe a little at some of the scenes.  You know how they used to portray incipient madness back in the old days: the echoing voices, the distorted camera angles, the gay laughter in the background suddenly turning into a sinister cackle?  It's all there.

And it's a little bit hokey.  Legendary screenwriters Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon do manage to come up with a literate and entertaining script.  The time-honored theme of the discrepancy between theatrical illusion and gritty reality is treated here entertainingly, if not especially profoundly.  As suggested above, the casting of the two major feminine roles is telling.  Winters' earthy, peculiarly American brand vulgarity is matched by Hasso's worldly sophistication and elegance.  The filmmakers make use of the actress's international background and even have her privately coo at her leading man (and former husband) in her native Swedish.

Worlds collide here, with predictably tragic results.  The elevated language of Shakespeare's OTHELLO (entire scenes of which are incorporated into the film's action) contrasts sharply with the jargon of the street savvy waitresses, cops, and journalists our lead encounters.  You wonder how true it can really be that Shakespeare provided suitable entertainment for the rabble of his day.

It would be tempting to talk about the universality of Shakespearen themes and how the film cleverly relates the obsessive jealousy of Othello to the growing madness of the actor who plays him in ""real life.""  Colman's character does have moments of heated jealousy and rage towards his ex-wife and her current admirers (one of whom, a regular Joe PR man for the play, he brutally assaults).  And as you might guess, he transfers all that jealous rage onto the poor girl he murders, since she mentions, quite innocently, that she has other beaux.

It's an interesting mix of reality and illusion, and as we all know, that's what the theatre (and by extension, the cinema) is all about.  In all fairness, I have no idea how fresh and new this notion may have seemed to movie-goers in 1947.  If it all seems a bit hackneyed today--sorta like the kind of movies they were making 60 years ago--I guess that's in part because it WAS made 60 years ago.",1188950400,,3922,4.852631578947369
635142,5,6303391915,"Directed by an Oscar-nominated Cukor, and boasting a literate, chilling script from Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, ""Double"" remains a first-rate psychological shocker. An aging Colman really earns his only Oscar in a complex part reputedly turned down by both Laurence Olivier and Cary Grant. And both Hasso and a sultry Winters score as unwitting flies caught in the web of Tony's diseased mind. See this unnerving feature, and you'll never think of Shakespearean tragedy in quite the same way. By all means, run for your ""Life"".",1182384000,,529,5.091954022988506
635143,5,6303391915,"Here's a memorable Oscar-winning performance from one of Hollywood's finest actor's, Ronald Colman, in a story of jealousy, madness and revenge.  In a role that was originally intended for Cary Grant, Colman is excellent as Anthony John, a celebrated off-Broadway actor who blurs the line between his character, Othello, and reality when he starts acting on the murderous impulses of his character.  As a psychological melodrama, ""A Double Life"" undoubtedly stands out as a success.

George Kukor's direction is exemplary as he successfully juxtaposes Tony John's real jealousy over his ex-wife's relationship with Edmond O'Brien, while mirroring the wracked emotions and madness of Shakespeare's protagonist.

Colman convincingly protrays Tony John's progressive dementia from the get-go the minute he is offered the part soon after the opening credits roll. For an actor used to playing debonair and  swashbuckling heroes in the 30's this role must have been a challenge for Colman, but a welcome one.  He brings a nervous intensity to the character of Tony John that is never melodramatic but is realistically portrayed.

Co-written by the talented actress, Ruth Gordon (Harold & Maude), ""A Double Life"" showcases an impressive cast including Shelley Winters (in her first professional role), Ray Collins, and Signe Hasso.

The score by Miklos Rozsa, as well as the screenplay by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, are both as memorable as the performances in this remarkable film. This DVD's transfer is markedly clean and lovingly restored from the original film negative and presented in the original 1.33:1 format in which the the film was initially shot.",1156550400,,1657,5.370656370656371
635144,5,6303391915,"For this 1948 film Ronald Colman, one of the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen, finally got the recognition he long deserved in the form of his first Oscar. In this absorbing, psychological thriller, Colman gave the performance that won the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Playing the role of revered stage actor, Anthony John, Colman gives an intense and riveting performance. When the obsessive Anthony John is called to play the role of Othello, he agrees to do so, and his ex wife and love of his life, Brita Kaurin (Signe Hasse) agrees to play the role of Desdemona. All goes well, and the play is a smashing, long running Broadway success.

Playing the role of Othello for such a protracted period of time, however, begins to wreak havoc with John's sanity, as reality and fantasy collide. Brita is seeing someone else in real life, and John, still in love with her, begins to confuse reality with his role. This spills over into his acting, and his acting spills over into his real life. This double life leads to catastrophic consequences from which there is no turning back. Those cognoscenti viewers familiar with the role of Othello can well imagine where this may lead, given the personal dynamics outlined.

All in all, terrific performances are given by the entire cast. Ronald Colman is magnificent in the part of the conflicted Anthony John, and Signe Hasso does herself proud in the role of John's ex-wife. Look for a young and buxom Shelley Winters in a small, but pivotal, role. The incisive screenplay, written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, makes for a drama that is redolent of the New York theatre. Well directed by George Cukor, this is a film that fans of the velvet voiced Ronald Colman will love, as will all those who enjoy a well acted drama.",1147996800,,1784,4.711538461538462

After a jealous scene, he goes in search of Pat and personifies Othello lines and the madness will occur, struggling in the real life to Pat until die.

These are the dramatic premises in which Double life unfolds. This picture works out as tale of opposing forces, mirror images and deadly doubles.

Illusion versus reality.

This was the only excursion of Georges Cukor in this genre.",1126224000,,831,4.9640287769784175
635146,4,6303391915,"Ronald Colman won an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1948 for his leading role in ""A Double Life"". Colman plays Anthony John, a talented and popular theater actor who has a reputation for being difficult and moody when he does intense dramatic roles. When his producer proposes that he take the title role in a production of Shakespeare's ""Othello"", a trepidatious Anthony replies, ""I've got a feeling it isn't the sort of thing I ought to do, great or no."" But he succumbs to Othello's lure, and plays the Moorish king opposite his ex-wife and frequent co-star Brita (Signe Hasso) as Desdemona. Anthony has a affair with a waitress, Pat Krall (Shelley Winters), who propositioned him as she served him. Gradually, the character of Othello seeps so deeply into Anthony's psyche that he cannot separate Othello's jealousy and rage from his own and he becomes convinced that Pat is having an affair with his press agent Bill Friend (Edmond O'Brien).

""A Double Life"" is psychological melodrama. Anthony John's passions are larger than life. His manner is studied and refined. And this all seems appropriate to the milieu: the theater. Anthony John's obsession -or possession- might have been an excuse to make a movie about theater. The film is immersed in the theatrical world. Great attention to detail were paid to the appearance and workings of the theater and its staff. We learn about Anthony's life and character through a monologue. Later, a soliloquy takes us through the actor's preparation for his role. Writers Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin create the drama by giving the process through which an actor transforms himself a sinister twist. Anthony describes his method: ""The part begins to seep into your life. The battle begins. Imagination against reality. Each in its place. That's the job, if you can do it."" He couldn't this time. ""A Double Life"" will be too melodramatic for some viewers and too stilted for others. But it's an interesting tribute to theater and a reasonably entertaining crime film. The Republic DVD (2003) has no bonus features, but the print and sound quality are good.",1121817600,,2104,4.960339943342777
635239,4,6303391915,"To act is to take on the personality of your subject. To be a brilliant actor, one must identify with the soul of the subject by finding a commonality within oneself and exploit it to the fullest. Anthony John is a brilliant actor who's been given an opportunity to play Othello, a dark brooding role, but is troubled by the idea. His ex-wife Rita explains: ""We were engaged doing Oscar Wilde, broke it off doing O'Neill, married doing Kaufman and Hart, and divorced doing Chekov."" For Anthony acting is all consuming.  Othello will bring out the best in Anthony the actor, but in order to achieve this level of perfection he must release a demon within himself - jealous rage. Once released, will he be able to put it back? Ronald Colman gives a riviting performance as Anthony John. Ruth Gordon wrote the screenplay.",1106784000,,818,4.680555555555555
635240,5,6303391915,"When we first see actor Anthony John (Ronald Coleman), he is standing in the lobby of a Broadway theater, buried in a trenchcoat with his face shadowed and hidden by a fedora, studying a painting of himself.  John turns around and we're given the opportunity to compare the live face to the portrait hanging over his head.  The artist got it all right save for the haunted, and immeasurably sad, eyes. John spends a lot of time studying himself in paintings, busts and mirrors - not because he's narcissistic, but rather because he has lost, or perhaps never knew in the first place, who he really is..
  Anthony John is a great actor, a toast of Broadway, and a great guy.  At least he is now, starring in a wildly popular light comedy.  When playing in darker and moodier plays something comes over him.  A young woman (who must have met him during an Ibsen play) bumps into him on the street and calls him a `stinker.'
 A DOUBLE LIFE is a gutsy and brilliant movie about a man in search of himself and an actor who never learned to ""leave it at midnight.""  To you a 40's expression, and this is very much a 40's movie, John is light and [...]when his character is so.  Dark and brooding when cast as a tragic character.  Theater friends pressure John to play Shakespeare's Othello.  He demurs: ""Some plays give me the willys, on stage and off.""  But the friends are persistent and John is intrigued, and soon enough he is up to his soul in that tragic tale of bloody jealousy.
  Laurence Olivier was originally offered the part of the obsessed actor, but he was unavailable.  The part, written by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon in their Oscar-nominated screenplay, calls for a good chunk of the final act of Othello to be played out on-screen.  With his reputation and stage background, Olivier would have been ideal.  The casting of Coleman, who was hesitant about acting that much Shakespeare on-screen, took a fair bit of courage (stage veteran Walter Hampden was hired on as a Shakespeare coach.)  Possessed of a fine voice and a decent profile, Coleman was a movie, not a stage, star.  Coleman not only has to convince us that he's a stage actor, but that he's one of the leading stage actors of his time.  I can imagine him getting the willys. That he won an Oscar for this movie indicates that I'm not the only one who found his performance spot on.

Composer Mikls Rzsa also won an Oscar for his score.  Director George Cukor was nominated, as well, losing out to Elia Kazan's A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT.

A DOUBLE LIFE is a fine drama that excels on just about every level.  Very strongly recommended.",1104624000,,2608,4.545064377682404
635241,4,6303391915,"I first saw Ronald Colman in the 1937 film ""Lost Horizon"" and I was immediately impressed with his acting ability, primarily his use of subtlety and gesture.  His type of acting is extremely rare by todays standards, where the stories are more likely to contain rapid, complex camera shots and special effects to propel the plot.  But back in the Silver Screen era it was all about a tight script and excellent acting.  That is what we have here, with a particularly potent performance given by the star Ronald Colman.  His performance garnered the 1947 Oscar for Best Actor, and many said it was a long time coming.  The story is about a stage actor content to play comic leads when he is offered the lead role in Shakespear's ""Othello.""  He is reluctant to play the part due to a subconcious realization that his roles eventually seep into his real life, becoming an actual part of his character.  When considering the lead in ""Othello"" this cannot be a good thing.  Tragedy is an eventuality.  The highlights in the film, for me, were the scenes from the play on stage.  Ronald Colman loses hiself in the character completely both on and off the stage and is ultimately very believable and creepy.  There are the occasional conventional plot devices common to the era used to wrap things up neatly, but overall this is a forgotten gem of a film from acclaimed director George Cukor.  Once the begining credits unfolded and that director's name was shown I knew this was going to be at the very least, acceptable; at best, exceptional.  This film falls nicely between those two possibilities, with a terrific lead performance from Ronald Colman.  Thank you.",1082505600,,1659,4.755244755244755
635242,3,6303391915,"""A Double Life"" presents a challenge to viewers (and reviewers). The basic theme explores the theory that a stage actor can carry his role into his off stage life-to the detriment of himself or others. As the story unfolds, leading man Ronald Colman is playing in a Broadway production of Shakespeare's ""Othello"".  A murder takes place at its' climax. Without question, those who appreciate that literary work will enjoy the early part of ""A Double Life"" far more than those who have not.  The movie fast-forwards as a waitress (a very young Shelly Winters) is murdered in ""real life"". The police investigation is stymied until Colman does something very stupid! This reviewer won't reveal what that was- or the ending- but DL switches to a quite credible murder investigation. The result is that DL is two movies in one, with the second half far superior to the mellow dramatic first. Somebody whose opinion mattered must have liked DL since George Cukor was nominated for Best Director and Mr. Colman won the Best Actor Oscar. There is also excellent supporting work by Edmund O' Brien as a publicity man and Millard Mitchell as a cynical reporter. This reviewer is more cautionary. Even the great Colman is hard pressed to shine in a two movies in one scenario. One wonders if his DL Oscar was truly awarded for past work such as ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" or ""Random Harvest"" and not this more mundane release.  DL is NOT the movie to watch Ronald Colman for the first time!",1063411200,,1475,4.75390625
635243,3,6303391915,"First off, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ""print"" for this DVD.
If you are familiar with most of the popular Ronald Colman movies -- ""Lost Horizon"" and ""Random Harvest"", for example -- be prepared for a shock.  In this film, Colman plays a dark role of an actor who declines into insanity and murder.  It's such a role reversal, no wonder he got the Academy Award for it!  Colman was getting older here -- 57 -- but the golden voice is unmistakeable.  I worried this film might never make it to DVD...thank goodness it did.",1059868800,,541,4.434343434343434
635244,5,6303391915,"For this 1948 film Ronald Colman, one of the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen, finally got the recognition he long deserved in the form of his first Oscar. In this absorbing, psychological thriller, Colman gave the performance that won the Academy Award for Best Actor.
Playing the role of revered stage actor, Anthony John, Colman gives an intense and riveting performance. When the obsessive Anthony John is called to play the role of Othello, he agrees to do so, and his ex wife and love of his life, Brita Kaurin (Signe Hasse) agrees to play the role of Desdemona. All goes well, and the play is a smashing, long running Broadway success.
Playing the role of Othello for such a protracted period of time, however, begins to wreak havoc with John's sanity, as reality and fantasy collide. Brita is seeing someone else in real life, and John, still in love with her, begins to confuse reality with his role. This spills over into his acting, and his acting spills over into his real life. This double life leads to catastrophic consequences from which there is no turning back. Those cognoscenti viewers familiar with the role of Othello can well imagine where this may lead, given the personal dynamics outlined.
All in all, terrific performances are given by the entire cast. Ronald Colman is magnificent in the part of the conflicted Anthony John, and Signe Hasso does herself proud in the role of John's ex-wife. Look for a young and buxom Shelley Winters in a small, but pivotal, role. The incisive screenplay, written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, makes for a drama that is redolent of the New York theatre. Well directed by George Cukor, this is a film that fans of the velvet voiced Ronald Colman will love, as will all those who enjoy a well acted drama.",1010016000,,1781,4.711538461538462
635245,5,6303391915,"As a director who understood actors and the problems stars often have managing their own screen personae, George Cukor was the perfect choice to direct this dark thriller about a Shakespearean actor playing Othello both on and off-stage.  The film's unique achievement, in turn, is to make us feel apprehension and suspense whether the actor is on or off stage.  As the paranoid Moor, Ronald Coleman plays the role with his familiar stylized cadence, a highly artificial elocution in contrast with his inner turmoil and potential violence.  The score by Miklos Roza, with it employment of the ""theremin,"" adds another artificial dimension--the operatic and melodramatic.  Consequently, the illusion vs. reality theme that we feel at the level of the film's story is doubled by the graphic black and white images vs. formal orchestra score at the structural level.  But rather than confuse, the pairings create engaging tensions that sustain the film's impact  on the spectator's memory long after the viewing of the film.  Like Shakespeare's iambic pentameter, 5-act plays, the formal elements of this film work not to suppress dramatic emotion but to suggest its explosive power through the very elements that contain it.",988243200,,1222,5.268041237113402

I would like to be a little contrarian and say that I can't imagine being interested in ""A Double Life"" with anyone from that era other than the ultra-distinguished and personally respected Mr. Colman, except maybe Claude Rains. For sure there is no way it was going to be a joke or be cheesy with either of these actors, and it isn't. An alternative would have been to hire Vinny Price and go the horror route, which would have worked but it would have been a different movie. Anyway, it held my attention and Colman deserved his Oscar. To play both a well-known Shakespearian character and play another role in the same film, switching back and forth like Colman does, takes a great amount of skill.",1504483200,,798,4.5874125874125875
