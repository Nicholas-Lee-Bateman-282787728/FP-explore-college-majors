1065867,1,6305750467,Not happy.  Big fan of RHCP and really disappointed with this video.  Mostly interviews.  Buy live at slane castle for a real treat!!!,1073606400,2,134,4.739130434782608
1065868,5,6305750467,"this dvd was spectacular.  I liked the focus it put on John, who is my guitar idol and my biggest influence.  It gives insight on the type of environment that the Peppers flourished in, as well as a look at what fuels them as musicians.  The interviews were excellent.  More of it would have been really cool (only 60 minutes), but this was well worth it.",1062460800,,355,4.333333333333333
1065869,5,6305750467,"The Chilis never cease to amaze me...after getting the ""Off the Map"" DVD, i had to buy this one...its great now to have both of them...first in ""Off The Map"" I got to see them live and get a small insight of the band through the interviews...this DVD was much more centered on the band itself, and the recording process.  For all other die hard Chili fans out there it was really cool to hear what they all had to say about the album...and I loved watching Flea coming up with some crazy stuff basically from the top of his head...All in all...GREAT DVD...if all you want to see Chilis live...buy ""Off The Map""...if you want to get to know the band even better...buy ""Funky Monks""!",1055289600,6,681,4.404761904761905
1065870,5,6305750467,"Before VH-1 started making documentaries of the making of ""classic albums"" (such as Jimi's ""Electric Ladyland"", Fleetwoods ""Rumours"", U2's ""The Unforgettable Fire"", etc.), this independent production in living black & white was shot of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as they became ""Funky Monks"" with producer extraordinaire Rick Rubin and retreated to a virtual monastery of an empty house in the hills above L.A. to record their greatest musical achievement ever, 1991's ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"".
>
The video/DVD shows the painstaking detail with which the breakthrough album was recorded (of particular interest is the recording of the percussive effects heard in ""Breaking The Girl"") and in between recording time we see candid glimpses of the Peppers being...well, Peppers, being dads, talking about the band philosophy and what makes them who and what they are (and skimming through the personal ads in various sex mags).
>
And of course each Pepper's awesome musicianship is put on display (particularly John Frusciante, who I swear must be the second coming of Jimi Hendrix with his pre-addiction guitar technique, showcased in all of its glory here...the entire album was a breathtaking performance for a guitarist barely 20 years old at the time) as the recording sessions are filmed.
>
The songs appear only in snippets and in various different stages of production; you won't see any full-length performances (although a good bonus extra would have been the video for ""Give It Away"", especially since -incredibly- that video somehow was not included on the ""What Hits?"" DVD that was recently re-issued; more's the pity it isn't found here, either).  You'll recognize songs that weren't included with ""Blood Sugar..."" that were later released (""Soul To Squeeze"" being the the most recognizable) in addition to those that found their way onto the final version of the album.
>
But the personality of L.A. is every bit as much the star of this film as is the personalities of the Chili Peppers themselves.  The feel of the town is everywhere, from the record offices where the executives explain the concept behind the recording taking place in the fashion it did to the locations where Anthony is interviewed regarding the lyrics of ""Under The Bridge"" to the wrap party that is held at the house once the recording has been completed...the soul of Los Angeles (such as it is) and the symbiotic association it has with the band are factors that set this filmed ""making of"" documentary a step above all the others; there is much more than four guys in a studio and a producer in a booth...it is an encapsulation of a city and its most identifiable band, frozen in time forever.
>
In summation, don't watch this expecting a collection of videos or a live performance; watch it with an interest in a fantastic band and the creation of their finest work and feel the city breathing through them as it happens.",1044489600,59,2908,4.969199178644764
1065871,5,6305750467,"This film was an excellent insight to the creation of in my opinion, one of the most beautiful records ever produced! it showed the flowing creativity and pure emotion these guys poured into this record, and the influence Rick Rubin had in helping mold these elements into something great. It was a very intimate film - it made you feel like you were right there hanging out with the guys, and witnessing the magik they created together in that house. It also gave you a feeling that you knew each one of the guys equally instead of focusing on Anthony and Flea, which is definitely an added bonus. If you're a pepper fan and haven't seen this yet....go see it!!!!!!!!!!!! if you aren't a big fan, but like the record, or need some creative inspiration....go see it!!!!!!!!!!",1023062400,,775,4.664233576642336
1065872,5,6305750467,"this documentary of the making of BSSM shows the carefree, crazy, and loving commeraderie of the band, while also giving you a true sense of what it is like to make such an important record. this was long before anyone knew exactly how enormous of a hit it would be, so what you see is a poignant testament to how important music itself is to the band. it is filmed in a gorgeous way, like an old glamorous film, but there is no glamour added here. its is simply four enthusiastic men with a lust for life and music doing what they do best. even they are a classic hollywood band, there isn't a shred of pretense, posing, or self consciouness. inspiring and at times very funny. 5 stars.",983750400,,687,4.333333333333333
1065873,5,6305750467,"1st off i'd just like to point out to one of the other reviewers that john was perfectly clean when bssm was made and was happy in the peppers (he  left because of all the fame they got and didn't aggree with the success  and was fighting with anthony-this came on the japanese leg of the blood  sugar tour in 1991)the reason why you don't get stuff from the reunion with  john is because this whole dvd (orginally rleased on video in 1991)was to  show what went on during the making of blood sugar (that's why it shows  snippits of the songs,not the final takes of them though)this wasn't ment  to be a video with music videos or that sort of stuff! it's just the making  of a album and what went on during it! i've been a fan for the past almost  11 years now and seeing this come to dvd was a shock! i'm hoping that they  go back and release positive mental octopus/psychadelic sexfunk live from  heaven/what hits?  on dvd too cause the 1st two are out of print and my  videos are getting pretty worn out! it would also be nice for people who  didn't have a chance to get them a chance to finally get a hold of them (if  they own dvd players!)the peppers this past week shocked me again by having  a pay-per view! amazing! hopefully they will release something on video/dvd  from the cali. tour/era cause it's been a while since their last home video  (a local radio station,whfs in washington dc had a contest to win tickets  to a show and a rare dvd of the californication music video on dvd but  other than that they don't have anymore dvd's planned as of yet!)check this  out if you a big fan of the band but don't expect music videos or live  performances cause you won't get that here (if your looking for that check  out positive/what hits?  both of them are music video compilations from the  emi years-what hits?  also contains the under the bridge video and a  sampler video of stuff from sexfunk!)check 'em all out cause they're all  great and so are the peppers!",965865600,6,1977,4.342465753424658
1065874,4,6305750467,"Wasn't sure what I was getting into buying this DVD, but I admit I enjoyed it.  I've always enjoyed watching candid stuff about bands, in addition to watching them perform.
This title, Funky Monks, does just that.  It  shows the Chili Peppers as they do a bit of publicity for their then  upcoming album ""Blood Sugar Sex Magic"", and I think at points you  can see that John Frusciante (sp?) was not completely stable at all times,  a sign that he would leave the band as they were touring.  I'd love to see  something like this for their last album, Californication, to see how the  reunion came about.
The only downside I'd say about this DVD that holds  back its 5 stars is that it didn't have any extras, like videos they made  for songs from the Blood Sugar album, or for that matter, not a single song  was played all the way through.",956620800,13,839,4.376623376623376
1065875,5,6305750467,"Boy, this documentary made me want to become a member of the band. I have considered becoming a Chili Pepper for the last couple of months, and this documentary made me think harder about it. I know my skills on the  harpsichord would only help the band soar higher on the charts. This is a  highly recommended DVD is you want a glimpse into the everyday life of a  band that is recording a new album in a house in California and are filming  that process and are releasing it for fun and profit and play various  instruments.

1065958,4,6305750467,"I'm a big fan of RHCP and love everything they release. However, I really think this should have passed through a better editing process, and I say that not because the material in the DVD is bad, but because it could have been much much better considering what they're covering which is the recording of one of their best albums.
The quality of the video is bad, but that's not a big deal for me because I know it isn't supposed to be like a big HD production.
This is an interesting video but I don't think everybody could appreciate it if they're looking for something more elaborate.",1391731200,,587,4.444444444444445

1066009,5,6305750467,"This documentary to me is like ""A Christmas Story"" or "" It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown!"" to some. (myself included for TGP) It's a beloved piece of work showcasing one of my childhood icons, THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS. It's an insight into the experience of making one of the greatest albums of all time. Some have complained that it does not feature full songs and some videos that were omitted from WHAT VIDEO HITS!?,  But i never saw that as the point. The film helps bring the audience closer into the inner circle of RHCP and helps to fuse that cosmic connection with the band. There are soundbites aplenty as the band shows of their wacky sense of humor and penchant for jawdropping anecdotes throughout.

1066013,5,6305750467,"This film documents the recording of the Red Hot Chili Peppers album ""Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"" and takes place at Rick Rubin's haunted mansion in the Hollywood hills.

If you like the Chili Peppers, films or music then this is a MUST OWN! You get to see a young Anthony, Chad, Flea, and John (who is probably only 19 at the time) recording one of their most prolific albums to date. Also, a youthful Rick Rubin and Gus Van Sant are seen, which is pretty interesting since they were just starting out at the time but have since become incredibly successful.

Nearly every song on Blood Sugar is included in the film, and the audience actually gets to see the recording process. We also travel into the mind-set of great musicians in their prime, and a legendary producer in a way that no other film conveys. If you are interested in making films, music or any type of art, I suggest picking this DVD up - it can only help you.

I could go on and on about the amazingly creative aspects of this film, but I doubt that would qualify as a quality review.

Buy this film, you will not be disappointed.",1244678400,,1097,4.389162561576355

Hear the band talk about the creative process of the album from its inception, the writing, the recording and the production with Rick Rubin. For two months in the spring of 1991, the band set up home and a recording studio in a huge mediterranean style manner. Each band member had their own room, (apart from Chad who travelled to and from the house from his own home everyday). It is interesting for the viewer to re-live the whole process from beginning to end over the 60min documentary. You even feel a sense of accomplishment yourself once the film is over. Although it is filmed in black and white and the sound is a little poor, this is a must see for all chili peppers fans who no doubt, share a spiritual bond with the band and feel this period in the Red Hot Chili Peppers was there best ever.",1163721600,3,899,4.389221556886228

1066078,5,6305750467,"This DVD is about the story of a LA rock band recording their best album ever (they didn't know it) in a mansion in Laurel Canyon with producer Rick Rubin.

This is mainly a DVD for hardcore fans, or any musician who likes to see what its like to record an album with rick rubin in a big mansion! its amazing. its a very relaxed vibe. its a non-narrator documentary of the recording of BSSM. There are short interviews with each member and short clips of them recording songs and parts (excellent). Anthony explains Under The Bridge, Flea talks about his bass playing, john talks about vibrations in the 4th dimention, Chad likes his motorbike.

This is 60 mins (too short in my opinion) and in black and white. don't let the color intimidate you, it goes perfect with vibe. the sound quality is excellent. This doesnt contain any of their music videos, or live on stage performances. i made an audio cassette tape of this and put it in my car so i could listen to it elsewhere, i liked it that much.

if you like the chili peppers and like the studio, this is a MUST. if BloodSugarSexMagik is your favorite album... they you NEED THIS.
