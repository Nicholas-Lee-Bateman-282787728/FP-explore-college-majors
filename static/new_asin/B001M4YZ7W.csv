If you like a movie full of surprises, one that is not predictable, a bit melancholy, a bit shocking, and an amazing ending, you will love this story! I highly recommend it to anyone who like a gay love story filled with suspense, surprises, twists and turns, and amazing endings!",1299628800,17,444,4.2976190476190474

3692228,4,B001M4YZ7W,The movie was much too slow in the beggining but the pace picked up towards the midpoint of the movie.  The final heartbreak results in a devine intervention.,1239235200,6,158,4.642857142857143
3692229,3,B001M4YZ7W,"I have ordered this dvd twice and both times had trouble with the subtitles. I understand some Japanese but I definitely need the english sub-titles and I was not able to activate the subtitles for this movie. If I clicked on subtitle yes and then clicked on return to movie, the subtitle button seemed to deactivate. It was interesting to see the special features appear with subtitles but the movie itself had no subtitles. The actors in the movie are very attractive and the story seems to be very nice but without the subtitles, it is not as enjoyable as it should be.",1239062400,18,572,4.563106796116505

Student is socially disturbed, adopted in the high-class society which does not seem to accept him.
Relatively nice ending.",1373500800,,229,5.764705882352941
3692232,5,B001M4YZ7W,The colors on the instand video are muted and rather dark.  There is very little contrast and should have a button on the unbox to make a sharper image and give the movie more contrast.  Otherwise the movie is fine.,1373414400,,215,4.35

3692234,1,B001M4YZ7W,One of the stupidest movies I have ever watched.  I could not finish watching it.  This is the 21st century.  This film sets gay people back 50 years.,1353196800,,150,4.285714285714286
3692235,1,B001M4YZ7W,"This movie is MUCH worse than the other reviews say it is. It is so stupid and so phony and so irritating - and the music is so annoying and overbearing - that I wanted to start screaming and write my OWN suicide note just to get away from it.

Maybe you have to be Japanese or a ten year old girl to appreciate it, but whatever it takes I don't have. I hated it.",1338508800,3,363,3.84
3692236,5,B001M4YZ7W,"This movie was absolutely beautiful, both artistically, and when it came to plot. I was pretty much crying by the end of the movie and I NEVER cry because of movies. The director, and producer, executed this film in one of the most perfect ways. It's a very slow movie but it helps build up to the end. The only thing I can say I'm disappointed with was that I was hoping it would be a little bit more... Explicit. But I can deal with just the cute, and very sad, storyline.",1337472000,3,474,4.163043478260869
3692237,5,B001M4YZ7W,"it's really sad when foriegn films turn out much better then the junk we make in the states.we have the talent and means to make decent gay movies,but sadly it rarely comes into play.this movie will pull you in and make you care what happens next. what a real joy to watch....loved it.",1337472000,,285,4.39622641509434
3692238,5,B001M4YZ7W,"I went into this movie sort of expecting the typical teenage angst/boarding school brutality movie that has been done ad nauseum. What I got was something completely different. Sure, there was angst and bullying, but the story wove its way through the film independent of those issues. The movie on a whole, from beginning to end, moved me because I could understand the underlying emotions of hope and hopelessness, faith and futility, need and understanding. The ending could not have been more perfect and what needed to be resolved, was.",1323216000,11,541,5.022222222222222
3692239,5,B001M4YZ7W,I liked it very much!  It made me shed a few tears. I enjoy good subtitled movies.  This is one.  I thought the plot was interesting and the characters were also interesting.,1322006400,6,174,4.375
8320424,5,B001M4YZ7W,"This is a story about love, that only the Japanese could conceive and film.  Its emotional complexity and level of human interaction draws the viewer into the deceitful world of young rich men in a private school.  It also displays the aspects of love that is not generally known or accepted.  Love can and will be a very fickle mistress, as what we want and what we get can be two totally different things!!!

8320426,3,B001M4YZ7W,"Just  finished watching ""Schoolboy Crush"" released by TLA Releasing..
First, a little background:  ""Schoolboy Crush"" is NOT the controversial gay pornographic film directed by Bryan Kocis that featured an under-aged Brent  Corrigan [at the time of filming]; and resulted in the demise of Cobra Studios and arson that covered up a real life murder of a gay porn producer.
However, this movie is controversial in it's own right.
Kairo Aoi is a teacher in a private all-boy's school in Japan who has just been dumped by his partner - I'm going to go out an a limb here and say that since Kairo is shown in bed with a male prostitute - Sora - who Kairo soon discovers is the new student in the boarding school.
Yet Sora has an honorable reason for selling his body - remember, this is a Japanese movie.  He wants to earn enough money to be able to buy the house he and his baby brother grew up in.  He and his brother are orphans - but his brother was adopted out to a family.
What unfolds is a disturbing tale of unrequited love and a rather shocking revenge that culminates in the off-screen gang rape and brutal beating to the point of death of Sora.
Surprisingly, this movie does have a happy ending - even though Sora is paralyzed from the neck down after he recovers.
""Schoolboy Crush"" is a typical Japanese  wasei-eigo movie with one notable exception - there seems to be no clearly defined sems and ukes.
[Note:  Despite having my ability to speak somewhat fluently in Japanese and other languages derailed a bit by my past two strokes, I can eke out a few terms - despite the migraine I'm now having.for doing so.]
Recommended for Japanese movie fans.
Three Stars.",1457913600,,1669,4.543333333333333
8320427,4,B001M4YZ7W,"Very interesting film with a good story to it, there is a lot of complex feelings mixed into the characters. Sometimes getting close to a soap opera type scene. The actors are good and play their parts very well. Overall it is a good movie but something you have to be in the mood to be watching.",1440374400,,296,4.2105263157894735
