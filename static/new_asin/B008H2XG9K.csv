5161525,5,B008H2XG9K,As usual with something good there are not enough episodes.  I got it for me but the whole family loved it.,1372896000,,107,4.095238095238095
5161526,4,B008H2XG9K,"The first series had some great laugh-out-loud moments, but the direction the series was heading was a little unclear.  This, however, is resolved in the second series which will, hopefully, be released as a region 1 very soon.  I was upset to hear that Boyd announced there will be no 3rd series.",1366761600,6,297,4.6923076923076925
5161527,2,B008H2XG9K,"I found the acting amateurish and the storylines boring.  I watched it twice, thinking I must have missed something.
The down trodden parent/ ex-spouse was over reached.  What parent would put up with the child's attitude?
Will be trading this dvd in.",1363737600,3,251,4.9523809523809526
5161528,5,B008H2XG9K,"This show is adorable, funny, endearing, and an all around lovely experience.  Honestly one of the greatest shows on TV right now, good for the whole family, and hilarious every time I watch it.  I am always introducing my friends and family to this show!",1363392000,11,255,4.644444444444445
5161529,5,B008H2XG9K,"Though the episode plots sometimes seem very random, this show genuinely makes me laugh out loud in surprise. The characters are ridiculous and yet very human, and it's one of the few shows still being produced that I'm excited to keep watching.",1363046400,5,245,4.857142857142857
5161530,1,B008H2XG9K,"Purchased solely because I like Robert Lindsey. He is a high quality actor. However his talent is totally  wasted with this
""sad-com"".
It is just not funny. There are too many annoying characters and the story flails about.
Thankfully there was no uproarious laugh track to make me suicidal.
Upshot? A real stinker. Save or waste your money elsewhere.",1363046400,2,351,4.9491525423728815
5161531,5,B008H2XG9K,Very funny series for adults & children.,1453161600,,40,4.857142857142857
5161532,5,B008H2XG9K,"Came on this show by accident. Was hooked first show on!! Clever, funny, quirky. Great offbeat relationships. Love the whole thing, and really hoping its not canceled?? IF it was, someone made a serious mistake. Never thought it had decent ad time to tell people about it. LOVE this show. #Spy show all they way!",1445472000,,312,4.6909090909090905
5161533,1,B008H2XG9K,No no no!,1438300800,,9,2.3333333333333335
5161534,5,B008H2XG9K,Loved this series. Very sad that they didn't continue it !!,1438214400,,59,4.454545454545454
5161535,5,B008H2XG9K,"I viewed this show because of a suggestion a friend gave. This show is a must see.  It is funny, witty, much more. Sad that it was another victim of network cancellation.  Take a chance give it a view.",1435881600,,201,4.128205128205129
5161536,1,B008H2XG9K,Did not say that is would not run in the USA and so could not use it!! Wish they would release it for the USA!!!,1429747200,,112,3.52
5161537,5,B008H2XG9K,"Love this series!  Never a dull moment, and every supporting character is just as funny as the main one. Season two has more episodes, but the very first episode sets up the rest of the series, so season one is a must-see.",1428969600,,222,4.285714285714286
5161538,5,B008H2XG9K,"The humor is unique, the writing is smart and the timing is impeccable.  Even the camera tricks and angles are ment to enhance the punch line. But I give the most credit to the cast that delivers aswsome performances, character acting at it's best. ""Tim"" makes me laugh as hard with his lack of expression as ""Mr. Bean"" does with all his goofy faces. It's a good show to binge on too because the way each episode ends leaves you wanting to see the next even if you've seen the show a dozen times.  Tried and true plots given a twist, dipped in hilarity and sprinkled with inappropriate social behavior... keep crossing your fingers for season 3.",1428537600,,645,4.504273504273504
5161539,5,B008H2XG9K,A show you can watch over and over! Very funny.,1427760000,,47,3.8
5161540,5,B008H2XG9K,"Brilliant!  Funny, great acting, good writing.  Darren Boyd is a real find.  Robert Lindsay in impeccable.  The rest of the cast are superb, also.",1426204800,,146,4.958333333333333
5161541,5,B008H2XG9K,"If you are a person who appreciates truly smart humor, you will laugh harder at this gem of a show than you have at any show since Seinfeld. As I am with practically every show out there (thanks to all of the nonsense, filler-fluff that Netflix deems ""watchable TV""), I was initially very skeptical of his show. Let's face it, people just don't know comedy anymore. Or so I thought... Even the most cynical viewer will be disarmed in the first five minutes of the show. It's positively flawless, and that a series of this ilk can possibly just be dropped after two great seasons tells you something about the wit of the television audiences out there. Try this out. Today. You won't be sorry :)",1421884800,2,694,4.515873015873016
5161542,5,B008H2XG9K,A light- hearted and fast moving comedy series of adolescent and adult mischief. A well written and acted series that leaves one asking for more. What will happen next? Who is really in control? Both series are well with the expenditure.,1419984000,,237,4.804878048780488
5161543,3,B008H2XG9K,"entertaining, despite being juvenile",1416960000,,36,8.25
5161544,5,B008H2XG9K,The physical comedy in this series is priceless.  The looks.  The double-takes.  The pratfalls.  The conversation is witty and sharp.  I wish that this disc had subtitles so that I could read all of the words and commit them to memory!  I thoroughly enjoyed this series.,1404777600,,270,4.760869565217392
5161545,5,B008H2XG9K,"The star of the show (Darren Boyd) is really good as the divorced father in this series. The son (Jude Wright) is an obnoxious brat, I'm sure its the way the story was written, but his constantly running his father down ruined the show for me. Meanwhile, the father gets into MI-5, but can't tell anybody about the new job.",1404000000,,323,4.4
5161546,5,B008H2XG9K,Great show with a good cast. Producers should keep making it. It is almost better than the real MI5 for real.,1403481600,,109,4.238095238095238
5161547,5,B008H2XG9K,"I love this series! Very sharp, very quick, very funny! My teenage kids and my husband and I all sit down to watch it together----a rare thing!",1402012800,2,143,4.333333333333333
5161548,2,B008H2XG9K,Main actor quit after 2 seasons leaving the story unresolved. First episode was great. But quality of story was uneven after that. Unnecessary bullying.,1391299200,2,152,5.375
5161549,5,B008H2XG9K,"Spy is the story of Tim (Darren Boyd) who accidentally becomes an agent for MI-6. It follows his efforts in trying to keep his son - a precocious boy called Marcus who is brilliantly portrayed by Jude Wright - from learning his Dad is a spy. Instead, Marcus just thinks his Dad is an idiot. The delightful Mathew Baynton plays Chris, a rather strange friend of Tim's with whom Tim used to work. Robert Lindsay is brilliant as The Examiner - a slightly disturbing character, to say the least! A brilliantly funny series.",1388966400,3,519,4.591397849462366
5161550,4,B008H2XG9K,"Spy is a very good sitcom from Britain, & everyone's accent isn't too thick or idiomatic, so you can follow it easy w/out subtitles. A very intelligent 10 year old boy (Marcus) who knows a lot academically, but lacks common social skills of his peers, is caught between custody w/ his dad, an inadvertent MI-5 agent who tested & interviewed his way into the secret civil service w/out knowing he was applying to be an agent, & a mother who has questionable sexual morals & cannot contain her disdain for her ex husband. A loose cannon called only The Examiner (the MI-5 supervisor) is somewhat of a psychopathic, sociopathic nut job, & has to be convinced everyone doesn't have to be killed just because it's discovered someone works for MI-5, is probably the best character after the son. Tim (the inadvertent spy/father) has a rudderless best friend (Chris) who is way more capable than he strives to be, & Tim's ex wife's current boyfriend is a touchy-feely headmaster & salsa dance lover. Of course, there's a potential romance w/ another agent, but her boyfriend, who was thought to be dead a year earlier, shows up to complicate matters. All in all, this is a pretty good show, but the first season has only 6 episodes, & it's almost the same price as series 2, which has 11 episodes.",1375142400,3,1290,4.662280701754386

8527916,5,B008H2XG9K,Fantastic show! Brilliantly written and acted! Have seen this show over and over! Really funny. British humor at its best.,1486598400,,122,5.15
8527917,1,B008H2XG9K,So incredibly stupid. I expect so much more of British comedy. So glad I could return it!!!,1486252800,,91,4.411764705882353
8527918,5,B008H2XG9K,So funny and smart.  Marcus the son is so well played.  Bravo!,1481846400,,62,4.083333333333333

8527922,5,B008H2XG9K,Darren Boyd is hilarious. Wonderful writing.,1455580800,,44,6.5
8527923,4,B008H2XG9K,"Show is funny.  Episodes are short, with only 6 in the first series.
None of the exciting scenes shown on the cover actually happened in these 6 epidsodes. :-(

Still, good enough for me to be searching for the second series.",1455321600,2,225,4.463414634146342
