5886708,4,B00E21QTHQ,I am a big naruto fan but what I don't like about this box set is that it is only going to have 2 discs instead of the 3 it has always had but I am still going to buy it because naruto shippuden is awesome but I hope they don't leave the box sets with 2 discs  that has bin the only disappointment  I do recommend you buy it .......it will be a great box set,1378771200,3,358,3.6363636363636362
5886709,5,B00E21QTHQ,"The previous boxset was, in my opinion a real disappointment and like many others, I just desperately wanted a return to the fantastic canon material the series is loved for. Fortunately, this boxset does exactly that as the five kage arc begins.

This boxset and arc contains possibly some of my favourite episodes in Naruto so far. Due to Sasukes actions against Killer Bee ages ago the Raikage requests a meeting between the 5 great powers and so finally, at long last, we get to see the other Kage for the first time.

What makes this set of episodes so interesting I found is that introducing a set of new characters not only keeps the show fresh and interesting but also really fleshes out the world of Naruto. Upto this point, its really only been about the leaf village and how great they are, but here we see that the fellow villages and kages have their own strengths, personalities and motives. Not least of the leafs hokage during this meeting. This set also strengthens the character of Gaara who finds himself the youngest kage at the table by quite some distance, and holds his own remarkably well and, with a single sentence demonstrates how much his mindset has changed since that fateful fight with Naruto.

Of course, this set isn't all about talking and action enthusiasts will love this set too. I don't want to spoil who fights who but I will say that Masashi Kishimoto isn't the type of mangaka to put the strongest people in the Naruto universe together and not show of their power. The fights are intense in this set and you will rewatch it again and again, I promise.

As if all that isn't enough we get Tobi making shocking revelations and snow in Naruto plus Samurais! There also a new opening to get you hyped and a zetsu moment which will shock and make you burst out laughing at the same time. Honestly, there may only be nine canon episodes in this set, but what nine episodes! Intrigue, action, world building, new characters and Zetsu! What more could you ask for? Definitely get this one, because the next boxset is even better! So watch this one first.",1378252800,5,2088,4.589812332439679
5886710,5,B00E21QTHQ,"This box has a few filler episodes in the beginning, but finally starts the Kage Summit, and the episodes end right before Danzo and Sasuke fight! The last episode on this box set is ""Declaration of War"" when Tobi declares war on the Kage. A must buy for Naruto fans! English dub is FINALLY catching up to the original Japanese dub. :)",1375747200,8,335,4.419354838709677
5886711,5,B00E21QTHQ,"These are the episode titles that this box set contains, note that the first four episodes of this set are part of the previous filler arc, however the rest of the episodes are 100% canon.

This box set includes:

193  ""The Man Who Died Twice"" (filler)

194  ""The Worst Three-Legged Race"" (filler)

195  ""Team 10's Teamwork"" (filler)

196  ""Drive Towards Darkness"" (filler)

197  ""The Sixth Hokage Danzo"" (canon)

5886743,5,B00E21QTHQ,This item had no damages on the discs and it works great. I collect Naruto Shippuden box sets and this is just the next installment of the Series. This box set was awesome especially the last disc.,1383004800,,197,4.351351351351352
5886744,3,B00E21QTHQ,"So, the moment I heard about this set, I rushed to pre-order it. I thought it quite strange that it only had 2 discs rather than the usual 3, but the contents of this set (I felt) were compensation enough. Plus, the cover looks bloody cool, if I may say.

I received my set last week, and I was rather surprised, because this wasn't the usual Amazon Packaging I am accustomed to. Each and every time I ordered from them, my purchases were carefully packaged in a lot of bubble wrap and in their typical Amazon box. This wasn't the case this time. I received the box set in those flimsy envelopes that I felt shouldn't be used by a large and good company like Amazon, especially considering how lousy they are for DVDs... Also, the envelope showed an address coming from Germany, and I ordered it directly from the US warehouse. The invoice was also torn, so it was pretty much useless. I was not pleased with the lack of professionalism I received in this case.

Now, as a collector, it was another blow for me. (I have been a collector since I was about 10 years old - that's nearly two decades of collecting). I was relieved to find that the discs hadn't dislodged, as they would do with those envelopes. However, that's where it ends. My box was one of those really cheap jewel boxes with a huge 'recycle' symbol where booklets are usually kept. I am sorry, but when I pay $35 for an anime set consisting of 2 discs that isn't being imported from Japan, I expect to get the gorgeous sets I am promised. I believe in recycling as much as the next person, but if the bundle was going to feel this cheap, it just doesn't merit the $35 price-tag...

That being said, I love these episodes very much (I had already seen a nice chunk of them thanks to legal streaming sites and even a few games). The action is brilliant, the drama is just right, the artwork is absolutely beautiful, the music is a royal treat on the ears, and the acting is spot-on, whether it's the original Japanese, or the English dub. I am in the minority, but I also enjoy the fillers in this series, especially a certain episode from the previous set, which I also bought from Amazon.

So, if you're a diehard collector like me, I suggest you check a retail store first, and see it in person; if you only care for the episodes, then buy it for sure. The episodes are amazing and powerful (if I hear more moping about Sasuke, though... Storywise, that's my only issue).

I apologize for sounding so ranty and whiny, but being a collector can be a real curse and pain, especially when you live in a place like Malta. My only option is to buy stuff online, including DVDs and tankobon. I only hope that this was a fluke, and that the next time I buy from Amazon, it'll be the same pleasant experience as it always had been.",1382918400,3,2791,4.359615384615385
5886745,5,B00E21QTHQ,"A great box set with few fillers, Naruto Shippuden Box Set 16 is a fantastic piece in the Naruto Shippuden world. If the last box set had too many filler episodes for you, fear not as this one only has four and they are out of the way early. After that, it is non-stop action, drama and intrigue as the Gokage summit arc commences. A must have for anyone interested in Naruto, especially if they intend on getting box set 17, which will conclude this arc and give way to what I consider one of the best they have ever done! Definitely worth $27.",1382227200,2,545,4.25
5886746,5,B00E21QTHQ,"I have not look at the DVD as of yet, due to the heavy load of homework and study for testes, I will Look at it when I take my final exam.",1381708800,,138,3.34375
5886747,5,B00E21QTHQ,"After you get past the first three episodes on this disc set  (which are filler), you get to the material that is really part of the manga story written by the great Kishimoto. It is done with amazing animation and the action that involves the five Kage and Sasuke is just the kind you will want to watch over and over again. This disc set sees the beginning of the Shinobe War and is a must for all Naruto fans. The story is exciting and the animation is beautiful.

I was disappointed that most of the action centers around Sasuke once again...and Naruto spends much of his time fretting over Sasuke and the fact that Sasuke is now being hunted down like the criminal that he is. I think that the continual obsession that Naruto has about Sasuke borders on a deep depression. Also, remember in disc set 13 when Hinata literally threw her life away to save Naruto from Pain?...Naruto has not replied to her about the fact that she confessed her love for him.... or ever thanked her for what she did. Hinata is really mute once again in this set. A little romance would lift the story out of the overdone Sasuke obsession/depression that Naruto has...and give him a spark of happiness. Oh, well....my love for this story far outweighs any hangups I might have about it.

All in all...you need to get this disc set! I wouldn't miss this one for anything! This is classic wonderful Naruto.",1381708800,5,1387,4.51792828685259
