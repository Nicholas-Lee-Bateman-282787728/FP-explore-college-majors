3945187,5,B002KYIAJM,"An organization helps young girls on the brink of death, but the cost is a hefty one. While they do save the girls lives they are used as assassins and put in high risk situations. Each girl is put into a group of two people which they use the italian word for brother and sister to call them by. These girls though have stronger feelings for their ""brother"" than any family relation. It's a sad and complicated story with action scenes, but they are not the main focus. It's short being only 12 to 13 episodes, but it is very good. The art work gives a plain feel which fits to the story and helps draw you into the characters. It's also fairly depressing so be prepared for that. This is a must have for my anime blu-ray collection and is better than the second series. I do recommend this title to anyone who is interested in story driven animes.",1253491200,7,849,4.3125
3945188,5,B002KYIAJM,"My first time through the series and I loved it. The girls kick butt and there isn't anything else I can say about them, its funny how woman are represented in anime compared to there normal station in japanese culture. Last Exile was my Fav anime series but this might have slipped by for me. Recommend it to anyone who wants to watch some good action mixed goverment op's",1375660800,,373,4.420289855072464
3945189,5,B002KYIAJM,"This is one of my favorite anime series ever. It may not get the attention of a lot of the bigger ones, but this is a really well done anime. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes action oriented anime with a great story. This is the first 13 episodes by the way. If you want the rest of the series buy Il Teatrino. It is also just as good as this first season. In fact I think its better in a lot of ways. Particularly the animation.",1374364800,,438,3.932584269662921
3945190,5,B002KYIAJM,"This series is not for everyone, the content can haunt you, and the plot is disjointed.  The horror tends to run just below the surface, but it is certainly there.

The blu ray does a good job of showcasing the product, and the subtitle font is well displayed and sharp.  The English track on this version isn't bad as well.

I highly recommend this show, and it even ends on an up note, but it is not a 'happy' series.",1369180800,2,419,4.2
3945191,5,B002KYIAJM,This was an amazing deal by amazon; a complete season in blu-ray for only $22. I loved this series becuase of the deep stories each one of the characters has and how emotions and feelings drive this series. Amazing visuals and compeling music ties this series together. Get this product now while the price is still low (The manga just ended and I predict alot of people are going to try to purchase this collection). I recommend this for any anime fan who likes a strong emotion filled story.,1359849600,,493,4.550561797752809
3945192,5,B002KYIAJM,"Gunslinger Girls is in my opinion one of the most disturbing but greatest animes. It is very philosophical and bring to life many questions. It has great character development, and has a fast action oriented story. Good anime. Great audio and video. No skips or glitches to be seen.",1354406400,,282,4.775510204081633
3945193,5,B002KYIAJM,"Gunslinger Girl is a great anime. I won't explain the story, but I'll tell ya what makes the series so great. The animation in this series is amazing. This is to be expected from a newer anime, but the coloration and backgrounds are very beautifully drawn. Much of the time you would think that you saw the characters superimposed onto a painting in an art gallery or something. The voice acting is also very good. The music in this series is also very beautiful. The relationships built between the characters are very well written and also pretty touching. The morality of saving a child's life but using them for a dark purpose is also explored pretty deeply.

All in all I can't think of a single bad thing to say about Gunslinger Girl. I am very glad I tried this one out, and I hope you get the chance to enjoy it too. If you like it the 2nd season, Il Teatrino, is even better in my opinion.",1350172800,2,898,4.345238095238095
3945194,4,B002KYIAJM,Fantastic series! The plot works both as a simple action series and as musing on what humanity will do in the name of stability or saving a life and if we have the right or not!,1344643200,,177,3.9444444444444446
3945195,4,B002KYIAJM,"I liked this anime but it's not for everyone. Having childs and young teens used as war machine and often only seen as weapons, it's kind of hard. I mean, the girls still act as child when they are not fighting and they seem to suffer to be treated as weapon. It's the kind of anime that will make you think.... If you are looking for something different, something that will make you feel something for the characters, that anime may be for you. Lots of violence, be aware.",1344643200,,474,4.337078651685394
3945196,2,B002KYIAJM,"Calling this ugly mess an upscale is an insult to upscales (though it is indeed blown up from SD 480p, indicated by the ""SD Remaster"" on the packaging). They've probably dramatically reduced the compression artifacting and gradient banding you'd get with a DVD playing on a 1080p screen, so it looks a lot cleaner than a 480p file can look but it's not perfect. The lines are nothing short of blurry, not to mention overly darkened. There are some things where I can't tell whether it looks bad because of art style or upscaling quality, but overall the image quality you're getting from this is nothing to speak positively about.

The audio quality seems good; as with the video quality, I don't have a DVD copy to compare it to, but I doubt it's worse and it might be better. I'm watching it in 5.1 but it doesn't make good use of the surround most of the time.

There's about twenty seconds of good animation in every other episode. I'm not sure what the people who think this is well animated have been watching - Dragonball-Z maybe? If you compare this to any recent action series the animation is disappointing, except for the rare combat scenes which only last a few seconds which are usually merely lackluster. Shots of everyday actions like walking, talking, shaking hands, are not very well animated, not to mention that the characters aren't very well drawn.

The story is pretty slow. I don't inherently dislike things that are slow, but the pacing here made it hard for me to keep interest, and because of the slow pace and limited number of episodes the characters are underdeveloped. Aside from the character development, the missions they go on are surprisingly uninteresting due to similar lack of development. You get some vague filler about how some guy is a terrorist, they check out the location, and then there's less than a minute of action towards the end.

I only paid about $12 for this, and based on the image quality I'm not sure I would recommend buying the Blu-Ray unless you catch it on another cheaper-than-the-DVD sale. I wouldn't recommend the series unless you're already a fan.",1327449600,3,2113,4.718157181571816
3945197,4,B002KYIAJM,"A tragic tale of doomed orphens who become assasins.  Thankfully, the action scenes are the best I have seen in anime since ""Ghost in the Shell"".

3945199,4,B002KYIAJM,"I wasn't too sure about this anime at first, but after watching the first few episodes, I ended up liking it.  It has a great storyline and the action is decent.  The characters are likable and not so annoying like how most females are portrayed in anime.  The story sucks you into wanting to watch more and they go into enough detail to let you know what's going on and how each girl ended up the way she did.  I also like the idea that ALL the storyline of each character collide with or will eventually collide with each other to become one.  I still don't understand why it's just girls (besides the fact that the title is Gunslinger Girl) and not boys as well, but besides that, the anime is well worth watching and owning.",1307923200,,728,4.323529411764706
3945200,5,B002KYIAJM,"Do the ends justify the means? Apparently, in this animation, the Italian government believes so as they secretly programming young adolescent girls to become killers. The series never glorifies what is being done to these girls, it just tries to explore the many consequences and paradox between innocence and bullets.

The storyline is well thought out, the drama and action scenes are good, and the character development is so well done that it could bring you to tears for the situation these girls have to go through.

This animated series went on for two seasons and I wish they continue to do more, although it doesn't seem likely. As of this writing, the original manga is only now coming to a conclusion and it looks like it's going to be a tragic one.

Although it's sad and has no comedy relief I think this is one of the best dramatic animated series I've ever seen.",1302998400,4,878,4.651612903225806
3945201,1,B002KYIAJM,"I'm not going to go into the plot of Gunslinger Girl, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation has yet again releases another upscaled piece of garbage.

This Blu-ray set has a number of issues with the video. The images are blurry, the lines are fuzzy, everything as a glow around it, there is a lot noise in the video, and artifacting during many scenes. The only saving point to this whole thing, is that the animation is simple so major issues are not as noticeable. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.

If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning this because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.

I added a screenshot to the images section to show how bad this release is. Make sure to look at it full size, as it naturally looks better at a smaller size. Also the screenshot was not altered in any way from the Blu-ray source.",1297900800,8,1039,4.345360824742268
3945202,5,B002KYIAJM,"I saw Gunslinger Girl, Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino, and the two OVAs. I truly enjoyed the whole anime series and experienced catharsis by watching it.  It dealt with deep emotions, ethics, and loss.  It is sad if you only watch the first season (though it was really good), but the two OVAs give the story closure and ends on a hopeful and healed note.",1296691200,,353,4.5
3945203,5,B002KYIAJM,"""Gunslinger Girl"" may ooze creepiness, what with the almost panty shot right on the front cover, but I urge you not to be thrown off by whatever possible apprehensions you may have about the content. Give it one or two episodes, and you'll realize that Marvelous Entertainment was trying to craft true art using a very inartistic subject.

The Social Welfare Agency is, in the public eye, a somewhat docile area of the Italian government which specializes in helping out the community in various ways. But their true purpose is something much more sinister. Finding little girls who are on the brink of death, then giving them cybernetic implants for the purpose of turning them into heartless killing machines, the SWA uses the girls in order to hunt down dangerous criminals and murder them for the safety of the people. By altering these girls, they cut short their lifespan by countless years, and rewire their entire brain so they have no memories of their prior lives. However, the latter of those two is probably for the best, considering the circumstances the girls came from.

It's a fairly offbeat and absurd concept, but the way the writers wove the story around focusing on the characters themselves, as opposed to the action they engage in, takes the show in a very gripping and emotionally kinetic direction. By the end of the final episode (of this first series, at least), you will have formed a bond with almost every character, both adult and child. You laugh with them, and you will cry with them. You will feel genuine compassion for the cast, forgetting that they are only animated characters. This is one of the few anime I've watched that I literally forgot I was viewing animation
and not live-action cinema.

While the image IS noticeably crisper in Blu Ray transfers, there is also a major flaw which has plagued other BR anime releases, and that's the fact that EVERY LITTLE IMPERFECTION is exposed. The animation is great, don't get me wrong; it's just that Blu Ray is sometimes too crisp for the picture in anime, and even the tiniest off detail can rear it's ugly head in high definition.

Other than that, though, there should be nothing that dissuades you from purchasing this anime. This is one you'll remember years down the line, and will be a point of comparison to other shows of it's type that you'll watch.

Don't pass up this anime, especially at this price.

Plot: A+ (Heartwarming and heart-wrenching, emotionally charged and action-packed.)

Animation: A+ (Beautiful. You'll forget you're watching animation.)

Dub: A (Every V.A. did a fantastic job with this series; nothing is half-assed.)

Sub: N/A (I didn't watch the subbed version. Sorry!)

Music: A (Beautiful orchestral sets, coupled with traditional Italian music, and sandwiched between two
  amazing opening and ending themes.)

HD MASTER: B+ (Looks good, but exposes little imperfections you may not want to notice.)

OVERALL GRADE: A+ (Must-See)",1275350400,11,2951,4.959432048681542
3945204,5,B002KYIAJM,Solid anime series. Characters are good and develop well. Story is paced well. This series benefits greatly from high definition. Highly recommended purchase for people who are looking for a bit more realistic anime series.,1274400000,2,223,5.4
3945205,5,B002KYIAJM,"This is the story of some little girls. Girls who were about to die, and were given a new life, but the cost of that new life is to become inhuman. They become cyborgs; a little bit human, and a lot machine. The reason these girls were rescued from certain death was not altruism. Their new life is as assassins under the direction of their ""big brothers"". The series is set in Italy, so the ""siblings"" are referred to as ""fratelli"".

They may be the most lethal little ladies around, but they are still little girls. Their emotions and reactions are those of young girls.

Strongly recommended if you want a series that mixes masses of gunfire with some thought-provoking moral questions.

The series is beautifully animated (something that sadly declines in the second season). This Bluray version shows off the beauty of the animation. I liked the DVD version, which was a good clean transfer, but the Bluray transfer is superb.",1272412800,10,931,4.734567901234568
3945206,4,B002KYIAJM,"Near the end of 2002 I lost interest in collecting and watching anime as a whole; Berserk, Cowboy Bebop (Perfect Collection) to name some were the last in my collection. After that, more new releases of anime just be became a drawn out cliche of animation and story telling.  While most were good, they were nothing like those classics before them, and so I lost touch in this area of the Otaku world. However, come 2005, I came across GSG by chance, somewhat seeking to renew my interest in anime.

The rest is history, what I got from GSG is great story telling, slick animation, characters you can really feel for, and a fantastic and yet touching soundtrack.  While the story is cruel and morally gray, it is more thoughtful than any drama-thriller on the market.  That is saying a lot especially for an anime; this is where I realized that I had found a gold mine.

I will not get into the story of GSG because well, in this day and age you can Wiki anything.  I will however discuss the quality of this newest edition to Funimation Blu-ray and if it is a worthy upgrade if you are a DVD owner already.

VIDEO:
To be upfront about it, this visual upgrade is not fantastic nor terrible.  It is an upscale if anything, but unlike most recent releases of Funimation titles it is presented in 1080p24 rather than 1080i30.  As you would expect coming from the DVD version, gone are all the compression artifacts and a plus for the clean lines.  Appraised for being beautifully animated, GSG really does make its presence more than it used to from its SD form, both in color and detail.  In the directors eyes, GSG is intentionally made to look at bit drab in terms of color to insinuate the bleak outlook to the film, but in this blu-ray edition the color pops and is much more vibrant while maintaining the bleak look. Detail on the other hand is somewhat inconsistent, clean lines in some areas then a bit soft in others.  Not a deal breaker, but it is apparent. Overall I am certainly pleased with the results though it is by no means an Evangelion Rebuild caliber, GSG has certainly never looked this good.

AUDIO: JP/ENG Dolby 5.1 TrueHD
Like most Funimation titles, the benefits from upgrading is the audio. Encoded in both JP/ENG Dolby 5.1 TrueHD (fantastic!), GSG sounds terrific unlike its Lossy counterpart. GSG is not an action heavy type of film, but when it happens, the gunshots exploding along with the shells dropping come as clear and crisp than ever before.  If that is not enough, you can actually feel if not hear the Cello's LFE in the constant soundtrack ""TEMA"". Most will agree that the soundtrack to GSG is as a whole, sweeping and heartfelt and yet mysterious and suspenseful.  Hearing it in Dolby TrueHD fashion this time around is definitely more pleasing to the ears.  Though if I had to pick something out of the whole thing it would probably be the song ""The Light Before We Land"" by the Delgados; it still sounds a bit thin and tinny.

EXTRAS:
Trailers, Commentary by the ENG dub actors, pretty standard stuff.

All in all, while not a huge upgrade, you have to realize that this is definitive version of GSG and it probably will not look and sound this good ever.  Any fan will love it, newcomers will appreciate it either way, but any blu-ray enthusiast would have mixed feelings about this one.  I would say check out this anime; it is unforgettable, told well, and the price is right.",1270080000,28,3419,4.555555555555555
3945207,1,B002KYIAJM,"I waited months for this to be released and was sorely disappointed by the video quality of this blu-ray. Generally love videos on blu-ray. When a blu-ray release is done well, the clarity and video is literally breathtaking. I can only assume that this is a DVD upscale since it is absolutely terrible.

Had I known this I would have never bought this blu ray. There is no point in buying this when the DVD release is readily available. You essentially bought a DVD that cant be played on DVD players.",1269820800,7,502,4.516483516483516
