370683,4,6301801083,"Released in September 1939, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is 20th Century Fox's near perfect follow-up to ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" from the same triumphant year. Though the credits acknowledge William Gillette's famous play as the source, the story pitting Holmes and Dr. Watson against arch-fiend Professor Moriarty is wholly original.
What makes the film so memorable, aside from its successful recreation of the gaslight ambiance of London's Victorian Era, is the perfection of Basil Rathbone in his second go-round as the Great Detective. Rathbone even performs a song and dance (in disguise) in this adventure, and gets to keep company (platonically, of course) with the beautiful Ida Lupino.
Mary Gordon is on hand as Mrs. Hudson, a role she would reprise in all 12 of the Universal films to come, and Nigel Bruce, though not true to Conan Doyle's vision, is a delightful Dr. Watson. And few actors were better equipped to play Moriatry than the devilish George Zucco who would match wits with Holmes again (though not as the diabolical professor) in Universal's ""Sherlock Holmes in Washington.""
If ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is not quite as impressive as the preceding ""Hound,"" it is faster paced and generally more entertaining. A good show all-around.

370684,5,6301801083,"I was rather surprised by how much I enjoyed this adventure of Sherlock Holmes. What I could not get over was how much Basil Rathbone reminded me of Jarod in The Pretender. This is the second of the beloved Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce collaborations.

Being new to the Sherlock Holmes movies, this was my first and I must say it will not be my last. The misty streets, horse drawn carriages and complete atmosphere of this movie makes it a perfect period suspense drama.

In this movie, the diabolical Professor Moriarty has an evil plan to steal the ""Star of Delhi"" and he tries to distract Holmes in a wicked game of symbolism and deception. He knows how to play with Holmes mind and almost succeeds. Holmes is of course rather nonchalant about the entire affair and would rather protect the beautiful young heiress (Ida Lupino) who is in certain danger and is constantly running to Holmes begging for protection and answers to the mind games Professor Moriarty is also playing with her.

So what does the ""Star of Delhi"" have to do with the inexplicable strangulation murders besetting the Brandon family? This taxes even the most formidable powers of Sherlock Holmes.

A Collectable Classic. If you enjoy this, you might
also enjoy Gaslight, the version with Ingrid Bergman.

but the movie is excellent and Ida Lapino was such a great actress. I had no idea she was considered a sex pot in her younger days
like Lucille Ball who played many sexy parts in film noir movies and was excellent herself. I also have Woman in Green and Dressed
to Kill on VHS which I have watched over and over and am finally replacing on DVD. Those are excellent as well and I see no reason
to complete my Rathbone Holmes collection. I thought Peter Cushing made the best Holmes ever but Rathbone had a more serious
approach to the character probably more like the one written in the book but Cushing still my favorite. I can say this movie and other

In May 1894 Sherlock Holmes tells of his targeting of Professor Moriarity. The jury found him not guilty. Just afterwards Holmes arrives with new evidence - too late! Moriarity boasts of a new crime that will destroy Sherlock Holmes. Moriarity visits his greenhouse, then meets a man who will mail a letter. Moriarity plots against Holmes. At home Sherlock plucks his violin to see how it affects houseflies. A letter from a young lady asks for advice. The Constable of the Tower of London arrives with a warning about the theft of a valuable emerald, the Star of India. Miss Brandon arrives for advice about a garden party. She is frightened of murder, an anonymous letter threatened her brother. Holmes will take her case (he observed Mr. Hunters behavior). Holmes and Miss Brandon visit the Kensington Museum. Dr. Watson shadows Mr. Hunter and sees Moriarity leave his office! Lloyd Brandon is in fear for his life; he is told to go home.

Watson tells Holmes what he saw. Their coach gallops to the Brandon home. Night falls. There is a scream from the park. Hes dead alright. Jerrold Hunter is the suspect in the murder of Lloyd. Lloyd was strangled, then his head bashed in to confuse the police. The police will watch Hunter. Watson lies on the ground, there is humor in his conversation with a passer by. Holmes inspects the footprints for clues, he finds the paw of a chinchilla! At home Miss Brandon hears a flute, she is frightened. Can she remember the melody? Billy says chinchillas live in Chile and Bolivia. The Constable asks Holmes to guard the Star of India when it arrives. Miss Brandon received a drawing like her brother got! Holmes advises her to go to that garden party on May 13. Moriarity has contempt for his servant Dawes. His appearance is changed by shaving his beard. There is a song for entertainment. Beside the Seaside. That entertainer greets Miss Brandon! Then South American gauchos play music.

Two policemen show up to guard the Stone of India. Navy men arrive to deliver that jewel to Sir Ronald, who will take it to the Tower of London. The Crown Jewels represent ten centuries of accumulated wealth. Then the lights go out, the jewel case was stolen! But it is soon found and placed with the rest of the jewelry. Was this a ruse to steal other jewels? Miss Brandon realizes the day is nearly over. Music from outside draws her to a window. Then Mr. Hunter arrives, Miss Brandon is frightened and runs into the garden. She is followed! A gaucho twirls and throws his bolas but it misses Miss Brandon. He is caught and names his boss: the Professor. Holmes goes to Moriaritys home and finds a damp shaving brush. Holmes figures out Moriaritys plot: to steal the Crown Jewels of England! Holmes and Watson rush to the Tower. Holmes follows Moriarity up the Tower stairs. There is a struggle at the top, Moriarity falls. Later Watson and Holmes read about Miss Brandon and Lawyer Hunter. This is a happy ending.

William Gillette was a famous actor in the early 20th century who wrote and acted in this play. It made him wealthy due to the publics interest in the most famous fictional detective in history. This story used Sir A. Conan Doyles characters, it was not based on any of Doyles sixty stories. It is set in the late 19th century, the following movies in this series were set in modern times. Basil Rathbone is best known for his role as Sherlock Holmes in spite of his other movies. Why is Holmes so popular? He acts as an agent for Justice who uncovers the guilty and restores order to the world. This comforts the expectations of the public.",1453161600,,3637,4.651632970451011

One that's more complex, and thus begins the duel. Rathbone delivers, as does Nigel Bruce. For those who think Rathbone's  Holmes wasn't faithful to the books, Neither was Jeremy Brett. And I happen to like his portrayal as well,  Moriarty plans to steal the crown Jewels. While Holmes is off on a made up mystery, And for that reviewer who disliked Holmes's experiment with the flies, it's meant to show that Holmes can't stand inactivity.

These movies were in a more modern setting than the stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. In the original books they traveled by horse and cariage, in these movies they had the advantage of cars and taxis'. Still, they captivated and held my interest.

370847,3,6301801083,"This is one of the ones with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. I think they made about a dozen Sherlock Holmes movies. The first was Hound of the Baskervilles and this was the second.

I don't believe anything I say here will count as a spoiler, since the movie starts with Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) getting off on a murder charge for having an alibi. Holmes rushes into the courtroom right after the verdict of not guilty has been announced and says that he has evidence which will destroy his alibi. Unfortunately, he has already been found not guilty and he cannot be tried twice for the same crime. In order to gloat a bit, Moriarty offers Holmes a ride home in his carriage. Along the way, he announces to Holmes that he will destroy him by pulling off the crime of the century right under Holmes' nose, and so disgrace him that no one will believe him anymore.

Well, it doesn't take a spoiler to guess that Holmes wins, Moriarty loses. But along the way is a rousing good adventure, and the mystery is there: (1) What is Moriarty going to do that's so spectacular, (2) what's all this about these pictures of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck, (3) What's up with this fabulously valuable emerald which is to be delivered to the Tower of London and which the custodian asks Holmes to come guard during the transfer, and (4) What's all this got to do with the beautiful Miss Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino; yes, she was quite beautiful when she was young, for all you may remember her as a scrawny comic actress with a funny voice)?

The fact is, Moriarty has supplied a variety of red herrings to keep Holmes from guessing what he is up to, and he very nearly succeeds. But of course, Holmes figures it out just in the nick of time, and with clever footwork as well as brain work, and even a bit of fist work, he wins",1337385600,,1836,4.394117647058824

I have not seen the modern remakes with Robert Downey Jr., but they just look like they are void of the haunting atmosphere/attitude/feel of Victorian England that acts as such a strong supporting character for the Holmes saga.  There's just something about an era without cars and cellphones.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that when I read the stories of Sherlock Holmes, I cannot help but picture Basil Rathbone as Holmes, seated next to a blazing fire in an oversized chair in a dimly lit, silent 221 Baker St. appartment, his face half illuminated by the fire, pressing his finger tips together close to his mouth, which contains a pipe with burning embers and smoke trails, in deep contemplation of his case (or perhaps earnestly waiting for the next case).  Outside, a chilly rain falls during a cool night in England  and against the the window pane and echos on the cobbled street.

I just recently received it from a close friend, he ordered it from my Amazon wish list for me.

370902,4,6301801083,"A little melodramatic and slightly clich&eacute;d, `The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' is nothing short of entertaining, which is a very good thing.  While the overall effect is less than I was anticipating, the film itself is a joy and one that I'd recommend to pretty much anyone.  It is sly, enticing and engaging and that is really all you should come to expect from a film of this nature.

Hey, at least it isn't overworked.

The film centers around the devious Professor Moriarty, sworn enemy to the genius detective Sherlock Holmes.  On the films outset, Moriarty has outsmarted the law and has been found `not guilty' for a murder he committed.  Determined to outsmart Holmes yet again, Moriarty devises a plan that will send Holmes on a wild goose chase that winds up being not so wild after all.  With murder and thievery thrown in for good measure, Moriarty keeps Holmes (and the audience) on edge.

I've never been big on the Holmes films.  I never read the books or watched the movies.  It's not that it didn't interest me it's just that I never found the time for it.  It was before me if you know what I mean.  That said; I'm glad I saw this film and will most certainly see more.

The acting was decent to great.  I thought that Basil Rathbone was effective as the sleuth and that Ida Lupino was a memorable damsel, but for me the true stars were Nigel Bruce (who was effectively goofish) and George Zucco (who chilled to the bone).  Their supporting performances (as Watson and Moriarty respectively) were exciting and noteworthy on all accounts.

The film moves at a brisk pace and never loses the interest of the audience.  Like I mentioned, it is a tad melodramatic, which can take away from the film a tad.  It tends to take itself a little too seriously in parts, which is only contrasted too starkly by the campy quality of the times.  Reflectively, this is a film that doesn't age extremely well.  Some films take on different tones as the years go by.  This film is one of those.  The style of filmmaking doesn't hold up as well as it could have and so the texture of the film takes a different shape.

Still, it works and is certainly worth seeing.",1273449600,,2174,4.532133676092545

This second installment of the Rathbone Holmes is among my favorites, despite being not very faithful to Doyle. Watson is a little too goofy and the whole thing has various flaws that Doyle would never accept. But the pluses far outweigh the minuses here.

Zucco is an excellent Moriarty; his scene in the cab with Holmes at the start is fabulous. Now that is acting! (Master Thespian says: ACTING!!) He captures the evil Professor spot on, as well as Rathbone does Holmes, no mean feat. And his bits with his subservient servant are matchlessly odd and perfect. That's the Moriarty I recall from Doyle, even though this isn't a Doyle tale.

A very young Ida Lupino is a cut above most Holmes damsels, very sharp and smart and very gorgeous as well. This is one of her best roles, I'd say, and she had plenty. Her brain is up to Rathbone's and you can see it in her eyes; their scenes together are excellent, with plenty of real chemistry both physical and intellectual. You don't see that much, in any era.

Bruce hams it up here, but it works pretty well; love the scene with him laying in the street and his comments to the concerned onlooker.

But this is as usual Rathbone's baby, and he turns in one of his finest performances here, by turns the supersleuth who misses nothing and then the wry wit not afraid to have a little fun with life in general. The way he looks almost lovingly at Watson in some scenes seems to suggest that Basil already knew his career-making franchise was well underway, and their chemistry is in full flow here. The intensity of Basil's eyes in some scenes is pure Sherlock as Doyle saw him, one feels, and that intensity is a real treat to watch in action.

Almost everything you could want from the Baker Street master on film is here, in fact, despite the story coming from a play written not by Doyle, and various elements from various Holmes tales, a not-uncommon technique in many of the Rathbone Holmes films. The spirit of Holmes is very much alive in TAOSH, and Zucco and Lupino combine to lift it to another level, where they meet Rathbone looking down from on high at ordinary detective films and smiling with merry derision.

The transfer is nowhere near as flawless as some of the others in the series, but clearly they had weak prints to start with. It's still very good, though, and in no way detracts from the beauty of this film. There's also a decent commentary from the late SH scholar/fan Richard Valley, with plenty of Holmesiana for the true fan.

A real classic, and one of the best Sherlock Holmes movies ever made.",1273104000,,2584,4.541935483870968

370906,4,6301801083,"This and the somewhat earlier ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" are the ONLY two Sherlock Holmes films with Basil Rathbone as Holmes which are set in the correct period.  All of the other Rathbone as Holmes films are set in the 1940's - the time in which the films were made.  While interesting, they do not capture Holmes in the way that ""Hound"" and ""Adventures"" do.  While period correct, Rathbone's Holmes is not based on any of the original Holmes stories as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The only really glaring fault of this (and other Rathbone as Holmes) films is the portrayal of Watson by Nigel Bruce.  Bruce portrays Watson as an elderly bumbler - totally unlike Doyle's original concept of Holmes' chronicler and  sidekick.  This (Bruce's portrayal of Watson) is the MAJOR flaw in all of the Rathbone as Holmes films.  I recommend this and ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" as essentials to any Holmes film collection despite the flawed portrayal of Watson by Nigel Bruce.  Basil Rathbone is the BEST theatrical film portrayer of Sherlock Holmes and even (not by accident, I'm sure) closely resembles Sidney Paget's original illustrations of Holmes.  Get this and ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (Rathbone version) and enjoy.",1264550400,,1238,4.93719806763285
370907,4,6301801083,"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes has a languid feel to it something like that later art films of Michelangelo Antonioni.  I feel that this element prevented Fox from continuing on with the series, instead allowing it to travel to Universal (a low budget studio with maybe a bit more appetite for the existential) which in the long run turned out to be a good thing.  Certainly Ida Lupino is giving the part much, much more than it deserves, and at the same time, a whole lot less too, as Monica Vitti seemed to in her work with Antonioni.  Lupino plays Ann Brandon, the heiress in a wealthy family who seems to be the target for a vendetta by evil South Americans.  They send anonymous, cryptic messages to her--not in English, nor in Spanish, just word pictures as a child might draw--or an alien species.  I won't spoil it for you, but it takes Sherlock Holmes and Ida Lupino days in the British Museum comparing the drawing in their hands to a number of stuffed birds from the Museum's famous ornithology and taxidermy wing.  Finally they realize what we in the audience could tell all along (though what that is would be a spoiler so I won't say it).

The storyline moves from one scenario to another.  Besides the story of Ida Lupino, there is another one involving Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) and his twisted relationship to his male manservant, that reminded me very much of how sinister Dirk Bogarde was in The Servant, again from rhe 1960s.  Much time is spent is developing how Moriarty is hateful and unreasonable with his employees, countermanding his own orders and undermining the spirited initiative of the butler, eventually reducing him to a puddle of male, penetrative flesh.  The contrast is always in how kind his opposite number, Sherlock Holmes, is to HIS servants including his landlady, Mrs. Hudson, and little Billy, whom the camera traps as he sweeps a giant pile of dust under a carpet outside Holmes' rooms at 221B Baker Street.

Elsewhere a strange Bolivian music haunts Ann Brandon, who screams whenever she hears the refrain.  Later she plays it for Holmes so he can identify it as the vendetta theme music that has ruined her family.  That music haunts me, like the music of the cell phone in the 2008 thriller ONE MISSED CALL.

Elsewhere elsewhere you'll laugh yourself silly as Watson steps into a large vitrine of cold water in a quiet and darkened greenhouse.  The expression on his face is priceless.",1262217600,,2444,4.74468085106383
370908,4,6301801083,"There have been only two long-running Sherlock Holmes actors who were really memorable: Jeremy Brett, and Basil Rathbone. And Rathbone is showcased at his best in one of the early stories about the legendary detective, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" an atmospheric and twisting murder mystery. The one downside: Nigel Bruce's goofy Watson.

Sherlock Holmes (Rathbone) arrives at the courthouse a minute too late, and angrily watches his nemesis Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) go free because of a lack of evidence. Sick of Holmes' investigations, Moriarty decides to utterly ruin Holmes with the most notorious and memorable crime in English history -- by distracting him with a bizarre threat to a young woman.

Specifically, a wealthy young lady arrives at his office, distraught because of a threatening picture that she got in the mail -- and in short order, her brother is murdered, even as her lawyer/suitor tries to convince her not to depend on the detective. Holmes becomes wrapped up in the potential murder, as the stressed-out police try to get him to pay attention to a threat to the Crown Jewels. Will he realize what's truly going on in time, or will Moriarty pull off the crime of the century?

""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" was one of the movies that cemented Basil Rathbone as THE Sherlock Holmes, at least until Jeremy Brett entered the scene. It's also one of the better movies that was spun up in the 1930s and 1940s -- a brilliant double-whammy of intertwined cases, deaths and bizarre happenings. And a brilliantly weird Moriarty to boot (""You've murdered a FLOWER!"").

Though the whole movie takes place in London, the director cultivated a misty murky atmosphere, in which a corner could hold a murderer and people are never what they seem.  And the stories are fast-paced and energetic, even when there's been a murder or theft, and there are still moments of eerie weirdness woven in -- such as the haunting presence stalking the young woman, and Holmes' elusive presence as he tries to keep her safe.

Rathbone's Holmes is the cerebral side of the Great Detective: cool and slightly languid, as if he's always lying back to ponder the mystery, but he also loosens up in disguise long enough to sing about how ""I do like to be beside the seaside."" He even fits Doyle's descriptions of Holmes -- tall, skinny, big nose. Nigel Bruce does a good enough job, although he's way too comic reliefy -- we don't need Watson to act like an idiot to make Holmes look like a genius.

""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is a thoroughly entertaining, brilliantly plotted little mystery, and Basil Rathbone's onscreen Sherlock is utterly superb. Give this classic a watch.",1254009600,,2700,4.920879120879121
370909,5,6301801083,"1939's ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" features the crisp direction and artful cinematography of Hollywood's most prestigious productions of the time, coupled with exciting thriller elements (a larger-than-life villain, mysterious clues, chases and confrontations in a dark castle, etc. ) straight from the adventure serials of the day.  It's quite a mix.  Based on a stage play inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's many Sherlock Holmes tales (though the play didn't adapt any specific stories), ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is the second of the fourteen Holmes/Watson thrillers starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.

There are some wonderful scenes with light and shadows and foggy London streets. Story-wise, it's okay nothing that memorable except we see a very young and innocent-looking Ida Lupino playing a nice British girl. Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is usual deductive self and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) elicits a few laughs along the way, not as many as he did in future films but more than he did in his first Holmes film, ""The Hound Of The Baskervilles.""

There weren't as many suspects in this Holmes adventure as in most of them, but that was fine with me. It was more a battle of wits between the good detective and his nemesis, ""Dr. Moriarity"" (George Zucco), which is better than having a dozen suspects.",1241740800,3,939,4.684848484848485
370911,5,6301801083,"THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (1939), starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, is a must-see movie for fans of 1930s Hollywood film.  But do not make the mistake of thinking, as one reviewer has done, that this is an accurate portrayal of Conan Doyle's literary creation.

Instead, the film is probably best understood as an historical film artifact: a descendant of the German Expressionist visual aesthetic.  The murky atmosphere; the gas lit, fog bound sets are half of the enjoyment of this work.  That is why, I think, the digital releases are so effective.  In my opinion, it is even better in the Blu-ray format.

And Sherlock Holmes is very much a super-heroic character, seemingly defeating the very murk itself; establishing order in the chaotic world.  And these were very popular themes in the Depression and WWII eras.  It is also the point, in my opinion, of much of the Golden Age Universal Horror films.

Additionally, there is a light, humourous tone, throughout most of the 14 Rathbone/Bruce films; in fact, in the following 12 films, Watson's character becomes even more of a buffoon.  That too, reflects more the WWII audience's need for light entertainment, and less Conan Doyle's stories.

What you do get in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (1939), other than the atmosphere and nostalgia, are great performances by Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce and George Zucco.

...and THIS was made then TOO?

Inconceivable!

Anyways, this film is a great place to get to know Sherlock Holmes by way of Basil Rathbone. I can't imagine anyone else in the role (although others honestly have done a fine job) and when I read the novels, I 'see' him.

I love the interplay between Holmes and Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson...they simply have the parts nailed. Nailed, nailed, nailed.

The breathless story involves, among other things, Professor Moriarty (of course), a diabolical nefarious ""crime of the century"", a mysterious woman, men of dubious intentions, a smattering of murders, and trying to find a fiddle note that irritates houseflies.

This is one of those movies that will have you saying, after it's over, ""they sure don't make 'em like they used to!""

371015,5,6301801083,"Adapted from a stage play based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" stands on its own as classic entertainment for detective fans of all ages, and may well represent the peak of the vintage 14-film series from the 1930's and 40's featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

As the legendary sleuth, Basil Rathbone further illustrates his mastery of the role with a dominating performance, which even includes a vaudeville song & dance turn in disguise.  Nigel Bruce offers ample support as the ever-loyal Dr. Watson, who doesn't appear as the bumbling sidekick he would later become in the series.  Ida Lupino portrays Holmes' latest client, Ann Brandon, while George Zucco appears as this film's devious Professor Moriarty.

Set authentically in the Victorian era, the story begins with Moriarty managing to elude justice (in the form of a hangman's noose) once again on a legal technicality, despite Holmes' best efforts.  Afterwards, two separate plots (one of murder, one of theft) are soon rapidly afoot, but only Holmes realizes that Moriarty is somehow manipulating these diabolical events from behind the scenes.

Amidst the sinister fog of London's nights, Holmes is subsequently pushed to his limits attempting to keep his lovely client out of harm's way from a ruthless assassin, while trying to locate Moriarty in time in order to thwart his arch-nemesis' greatest scheme yet.

371017,1,6301801083,"I would have only given this movie half a star if I could, and that is because I can use the DVD case for my other CDs.
The movie is so irritatingly silly, that I couldn't bring myself to see it again.
Now, I should tell you that, I am a Sherlock Holmes fan and have read all of the stories and have all of the box collections by Jeremy Brett, and that is why when I chanced upon this one I didn't hesitate to buy it.
What a mistake I made.
The movie does its best to portray a man that is as far as possible from Sherlock Holmes, and yet they call him Sherlock Holmes!
From the very first moment that you meat ""Holmes"" when he is ""trying to find the correct note with his violin that would irritate the flies"", which is simply against the very simple fact that ""Sherlock Holmes never knows anything or does anything, which is not directly connected with his line of work"", to the moment that he fails at every step to clearly see the thing that is really going on (this by the way could be related to the incredibly dull plot of the story, but it does little to improve the character of the great detective), we see a figure which is anyone but Sherlock Holmes.
The above description would suffice to realize how Watson may be presented. Yes the local buffoon.
All this is simply against every intellectually interesting point that attracts the reader to Sherlock Holmes.
And at the end, to magnify that which is already a disaster, the plot of the story takes away the only possible surprising feature of the story, (which is one of the intriguing aspects of Doyle's genius in creating each of Holmes' stories), when they reveal to us plainly, what the one, Professor Moriarty, is planning to do, in his own words.
In sum, I wonder if this movie even deserves the half star that I had considered for it, because not only the movie was a complete disaster, it inflicted upon a unique figure in the history of literature such a stain that takes away the shine of even that half star.",1087430400,13,1983,4.347708894878706
371018,4,6301801083,"Many actors have tried, but none has surpassed Basil Rathbone's embodiment of Sherlock Holmes.

Odd to think, then, that the first Holmes film with Rathbone and his faithful Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, gave neither man starring credit. That honor on ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" went to the romantic leading man, Richard Greene.
The lapse in logic was quickly corrected, with Rathbone and Bruce going on to top-bill 13 famed Holmes movies from 1939-46.
The UCLA Film and TV Archive has rescued the films from public domain hell, in a restoration that aims to return them to 35mm theatrical condition using original elements and acetate copies. The results as seen on MPI's DVDs are indeed impressive, with shadows and light elegant and edgy. Wear is within reason, and the audio suffices.
Film historians' commentaries have been added to some of the feature films, explaining, for instance, just how the 19th century detectives ended up battling Nazis in WWII.
The MPI collection -- whose titles are available separately and in sets -- started rolling out in the fall. The series concludes at the beginning, with ""Baskervilles"" and ""Adventures,"" both made by Fox before Universal took over and ""modernized"" the Doyle stories. The Uni films have their moments -- ""Woman in Green,"" for example, is grand and grisly entertainment -- but there's no topping these initial releases, set in Victorian times.
""Adventures,"" the second Fox film, immortalized the line ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" -- catchy, but never from Doyle's pen. The film is based on a play by William Gillette, with two overlapping original but true-to-the-canon mysteries.
The movie opens with one of the series' best moments as Holmes and his nemesis Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) exchange pleasantries and mortal threats as they share a carriage ride. Ida Lupino melts hearts in her last ingenue role.
Holmes magazine editor Richard Valley does a decent job on the commentary but spends far too much time telling the life stories of all involved, even the bit players. You can just hear Holmes yelling, Get on with it, man!",1086739200,16,2289,5.074270557029178

Which is not to say that they're chummy. Holmes says, ""You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it pickled in alcohol to the London Medical Society.""

Moriarty responds even more to the point, and promises Holmes that he will crush him. Later in his home, he tells a minion that he will destroy Holmes using ""a peculiarity of Holmes' brain, its perpetual restlessness. Its constant struggle to escape boredom."" In short, he's going to dangle bait the great detective will be unable to resist.

Bonus Features:

It's now defunct and Valley died of cancer in 2007, but he was a good person to chose for the commentary track, because he specialized in movie trivia. I should know, because I was a ""Scarlet Street"" subscriber. (You can find old issues for sale on amazon!) This commentary track was taken in 2004 and in addition to interesting factoids, I recommend it for the humor.
Valley says, ""Most fans know that Rick, in 'Casablanca', never really says 'Play it Sam.' They know Tarzan never really says 'Me Tarzan, you Jane.' Well, in the movies, Sherlock Holmes really does say, 'Elementary, my dear Watson.' He says it a lot.... What Sherlock Holmes doesn't do, is say 'Elementary, my dear Watson' in a single one of the 56 short stories and 4 novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.""

Some of their Sherlock movies have been colorized, but this is one is in black & white, which I consider an atmospheric plus. This is not the best of the best, and has some plot oddities which could bug me if I wanted to be bugged. But I just like Rathbone's Holmes immensely. 3.6 stars, rounded up to 4.
