8256658,4,B0014Z4OI4,"I would recommend this instructional video to any beginner who wants to learn the basic quickstep in Ballroom Dancing. There are several options on the menu which allow you to practice alone,(as follower or leader), or as a couple. The pace is slow,and repeats a number of times, which is good for beginners like my husband and myself. It also gives three different pattern combinations to follow, which helps in a fast paced step like this one.
The only negative in my opinion, is that you have to determine the exact foot positions by just watching the husband/wife. It does not say, as some videos, do ""now go back with your left foot and turn clockwise a quarter turn, etc."" Still, for the price, it was worth it!",1255392000,4,717,4.609375
8256659,2,B0014Z4OI4,"the instruction is very detailed which is very commendable. however, it is limited to only three variations and  the most important steps which are the kicks and the jumps are not included in this video. very disappointing.",1224028800,4,223,5.027027027027027
