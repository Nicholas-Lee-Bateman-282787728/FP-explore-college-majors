TWO YOUNG MEN WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN THEIR CAREERS TO LEVELS WAY BEYOND THE HIP HOP REALM!  BUY THIS DVD PLEAS!! IT APPROACHES SUBJECT MATTER THAT NOBODY ELSE HAD THE HEART TO.

1828204,2,B000087F6O,"Those expecting any type of insight on the lives or careers of Shakur or Biggie should probably avoid. While there is some mention of Biggie, most of the film is dedicated to the murder investigations.
While the ""truth"" behind what really happened should obviously be the focus of this film, I felt that a lot more should have been done with telling the audience the backstory. There is little to no mention of the actual feud that these two had. If you don't know anything about Death Row or the artists in the title then you may have trouble following the film. Most of the facts are presented poorly and some of the information like the reports of Snoop being scared for his life are poorly-researched, one-sided, and very much opinionated.
As a huge fan of this entire story, I was bored to death and those who would like a more professional-looking account of the events may want to check out the VH-1 ""Behind The Music"" on The Notorious B.I.G.",1056844800,,949,4.588235294117647
1828205,1,B000087F6O,"I regret having bought this DVD. I am a huge fan of both Pac and Biggie and was hoping for a great documentary, after all people were lining up at the Sundance Film Festival 5 deep to see this.  Nick Broomfield's techniques are so amateurish I felt embarrassed for him. At one point he ""runs out of sound"" during an interview, in another part, he chooses to call an important FBI source from his cell phone while DRIVING through traffic. Many of his questions are so full of fluff that one ex cop he questions tells him to ask more specific questions! At one point he approaches someone in a barbershop, seemingly desperate to find someone who knows Biggie--a woman there claims to know him but refuses to be interviewed...why include this??? Broomfield is a rookie at documentaries...I think most film major college students would have made a much better film. Out of the 2 hours of this DVD , I liked maybe 20 min (that included Biggie free styling on a corner when he was younger). If you really want to see this, RENT IT, you'll thank me for it. ""Thug Angel"" was 3 times better than this.",1054166400,,1092,4.4874371859296485

This is by far his masterpiece!
Anyone who enjoys the documentary style should see this.  It's truly a work of art!
In typical Broomfield style, he pushes his way through people and places that most of us would never even consider going to, never mind having extra body-guards!  Having lost a camera-man in what's described as self-preservation, Nick continues his quest for answers.

Biggie had to be killed a few months later to maintain the fiction. It may well be true. However, nowhere do we see the LAPD responding, nor any responsible attorney or any legitimate media, such as the LA Times, which got into trouble over this case.

That part is cool, but the overall video is basically just an investigative reporter being followed by a camera. The interviews are pretty good, but in the end a lot of it is an investigation of their deaths and not the ""beef"" they had between them.  For the $8 I paid, it was worth it.  However, this could have been better if more money was invested into it.

1828270,2,B000087F6O,"This documentary is a major disappointment.  That is mainly due to the terrible director/narrator.  It's pretty obvious that this guy did little to no research on the topic and had little emotion towards the subject.  Also, the narration reads like a 4th graders book report.  Examples ""this is the school where tupac learned to act."" ""here is the street tupac grew up on"".  This is tupacs friend.  etc.  MAKE A COMPLEX SENTENCE U IDIOT.  It was infuriating and annoying.

The biggest insult was the director/narrator himself.  He is a Brit that did not seem to have any idea who these titans of hip-hop were or what they were all about.  Why did he even make this movie?  It was obviously he was not a fan and did not care or know any background on the music, their motives or what they spoke of in their timeless lyrics.  I really don't think he knew the impact that they had on music or the art form in general and just wanted to cash in on two of the greatest rappers of all time.  It is a seriously slap in the face to serious fan and there are NO real ""revelations"" here.  I don't understand why the other reviewers rated this so high, are we watching the same thing?",1205107200,,1173,4.3657407407407405
1828271,2,B000087F6O,"I was bored last night, and so I decided to head down to my local video store to check out some movies. I went to the documentary section and saw this movie. I picked it up and read the back cover. It seemed promising enough. It was made in 2001, just prior to ""Suge"" Knight's release from prison. It supposeldy included interviews with a long-time investigator on the case and long-time friends of Biggie and Tupac.

I was somwhat dissapointed after watching the film. The thing about it is that while the director did a good job of getting interviews with people close to the case, he offered little as far as taking the information people gave him and forming some kind of opinion to share; the director seemed very apathetic through out the film and his motive and sincerity were questionable. At points in the film, his attention wavered, floating somewhere else. He showed a lack of professionalism, walking around with his equipment and at certain points when his interviewees said something to him, he reacted with coments showing that he really didn't understand what they were saying or that he really wasn't listening. At one point he goes into about a five minute questioning of a former girlfriend of dirty cops in the case about her sexual relationships with her ex-cop boyfriends--asking her if they had threesomes and what they were like. He shows an interest for sensationalism during an interview with Suge Knight, basically baiting Suge into talking about Snoop Dogg and his feelings about him. All these things have little to do with the actual topic of the movie: Biggie and Tupac.

The production of the movie is annoying and poor. There are times when the microphone does not pick up sounds well enough. The movie is shot in grainy visuals like points in the movie Traffic. The soundtrack is very monotnous, playing one or two songs through out the entire film: Gangstarr songs.

With all the bads about the film, there are some goods. The film offers a rare glimpse into the personal side of Tupac and Biggie. There are interviews with Tupac's biological father, Volletta Wallace, one of Tupac's childhood best friend from baltimore(whom they called whitey), Tupac's teacher in the art school he attended as a teen and other interviews. I felt like I knew a little more about who Biggie and Tupac were, behind the scenes, through these interviews. There is also great footage of Biggie and Tupac hugging on stage and of Tupac in the studio in June of 1996. Some of the interviews are so personal that they can bring you to tears.

Overally, I'd give this flick a 2.5/5. I think there could have been so much more done with the things the director had at his disposal. The interviewees were the stars of the film. The director was a dud.",1200441600,3,2760,4.719917012448133
1828272,2,B000087F6O,"I had high expectations for this DVD, but it wasn't what I expected.  I don't think it was worth the money!",1191196800,,107,4.095238095238095
1828273,4,B000087F6O,"This is a documentary about Tupac Shakur (2Pac) and Christopher Wallace (Notorious BIG), who were popular rap music stars in the 1990's, but they were both murdered in their mid-20's barely 6 months apart from each other.  Both crimes have never been solved, and British documentarian Nick Broomfield attempts to patch together some possible answers, involving various people either connected to the two artists or to the murder investigation.

Pros:
Broomfield reveals his own shortcomings and fears along the way, debunking the ""fearless journalist"" image that many in today's news culture like to promote.  He apparently accepts an off-camera scolding from Voletta Wallace early on (his narration mentions it), when word comes back to her on his unannounced visits to  some of Biggie (Wallace)'s old Brooklyn hang out spots.

Some standout interviews include:

Biggie's mother, Voletta Wallace.  She is very passionate and forthcoming in assessing the things that went right and went wrong in her son's life.

The high school teacher who Tupac allegedly considered a foster father of sorts; he claims that Tupac had the range to do Shakespeare, having gone to school at a Performing Arts academy.

Tupac's real father is interviewed, and looks like him; the footage is relatively short, concerning him, however-- especially since Afeni is not interviewed.

The ex-cops who were associated with Tupac, or LAPD, who offer lots of interesting views from their perspective on what happened..

shortly after Tupac's death, A bookkeeper who claims that he was paid money to arrange the murder of Biggie Smalls.

A former bodyguard of Biggie who ID's the alleged gunman who shot at Biggie the night he died.. the alleged party, known by name, has to date, never been charged.

Cons:
No involvement from Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur.  Given that the Afeni-supported ""Tupac: Resurrection"" movie (MTV Films) came only a few years later, it is unknown whether she was in negotiations to start that project at the time that Mr. Broomfield began his work, or if she simply just wasn't interested in him for other reasons.

The interview with Suge Knight isn't very revelatory about the murder incident, but given Suge is an incarcerated felon and his history of gangster ethics, it was doubtful he'd set himself up to be labeled as a ""snitch"" over Tupac's death, whether he was involved or not.

No interviews are seen with anyone representing the LAPD. You have testimony from former officers, but none from LAPD officials themselves.  it is unknown if Broomfield attempted to interview anyone from the LAPD.

*************
Assessment:  Broomfield comes away with the conclusion that parties at Death Row Records were involved with the deaths of both Tupac and Biggie;  accomplices would be parties at the Los Angeles Police Department, cops who moonlighted as ""security"" for the label who were allegedly crooked and  involved with drug trafficking.

Bonus footage includes interviews that didn't make the main film, discographies for both artists, an interview with the filmmaker, and information about the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation.",1187827200,6,3139,5.27364185110664
1828274,4,B000087F6O,"It has an honest in your face tone to it and the style of the interviews lends a high degree of credibility.

The obvious reluctance of the people being interviewed makes it known that these murders were seriously planned by persons who can make ones life very uncomfortable..even cease.

This is a highly believable documentary.

That Suge has something to do with Tupac's 'disappearance' is wthout a doubt ...but I doubt the truth will ever be known.",1144800000,,452,4.8441558441558445
1828275,3,B000087F6O,"I've always been interested in the theories of Tupac's death, so decided to buy this documentary.  This obviously deals entirely with the theory that Suge Knight arranged the hit, and then also Biggie's death, to make it look like retaliation.  The problem with this theory is that i wasn't buying it before and after watching this im still not.  It goes something like this, Suge suspected that Pac was possibly trying to get out of Death Row, he realised that if he killed him, he would have access to all his music, which amounted to hundreds of tracks.  Also he would probably make more money from him if dead, as he would have become sort of a martyr.  Up to this point it is believable, what isn't are the circumstances of his death.  If Suge wanted Pac dead, why would he have a car pull up alongside and fire across the car right where he was also sitting (he also received a minor flesh wound), there would have been better ways to arrange this.  Nick Broomfield fails to answer this, and i still can't really beleive Suge Knight planned it.  It is much more likely that Orlando Anderson (the guy beaten up at the MGM beforehand) was behind the killing, or even that Biggie himself arranged the hit with the Crips that carried it out (though im not really buying that one either).

1828309,5,B000087F6O,"Perhaps no murders in the music culture from the last decade have caused so much fascination and debate as those of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. The killings of these two rap stars remain important footnotes in the debate about the influence of rap music and the relevance of rap in today's popular culture. Nick Broomfield's latest film, ""Biggie And Tupac,"" is both an exploration of the gangsta rap underworld and a fascinating search for answers and testimony involving the murders. As was the case with Broomfield's previous icon murder mystery, ""Kurt & Courtney"" which tried to find a link between Courtney Love and the suicide between her rock star husband, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, ""Biggie And Tupac"" doesn't solve the case or even come to a solid conclusion. Instead it presents us with a gallery of both corrupt and truth searching characters and lots of questions, many valid. Fans of Broomfield know he will stop at nothing to at least get a few comments, the man will try everything from sneaking mikes to chasing down reluctant sources to get some form of information. The stakes here are higher because the people Broomfield is investigating are not angry Punk rockers or disgruntled former friends but people linked to dangerous California gang circles, corrupt policemen and a record label boss who fashions himself as a modern day Al Capone. What we get out of the film is that Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls started off as good friends and as soon as they found real success with their craft other forces such as Suge Knight began to influence events with a negative air due to money and rivalries with figures such as Sean ""Puffy"" Combs. The main theory here is that Knight had connections with corrupt L.A. P.D. officers who worked for Death Row records on the side and planned BOTH executions and then blame them on the East Coast vs. West Coast ""rap wars."" It may sound like a wild idea, but look at the evidence and people Broomfield uncovers and it becomes more valid. And here Broomfield has more material to use. ""Kurt & Courtney"" was plagued by Courtney Love's restriction of Broomfield using footage and music, and eventhough Shakur's mother doesn't let him use songs, Broomfield uses interviews, early performance footage and photographs to describe the rise of Biggie and Tupac and point out those who were present and witnessed important events. It's a suspenseful ride at times, playing like a real life murder mystery. We learn a great deal about the gang world of California where being a ""snitch"" is a death sentence and Broomfield gives a tour of the excessive, edgy world of rap music. Bodygaurds and ex-cops are interviewed, all telling what they saw and we realize that indeed these are two murders surrounded by such strange stories, eyewitness accounts and corruption that there is no way these were random killings. And Broomfield does it with gusto and style, never relenting and even going for the big fish when he gets access into a prison facility to face Suge Knight in person. ""Biggie & Tupac"" is the kind of documentary those who don't even care for rap can enjoy because it is more about the mysteries surrounding the two stars' murders, it plays like a dark detective story that still hasn't found an answer. Broomfield scores again.",1088899200,9,3285,4.857397504456328
1828310,1,B000087F6O,"What could have been a very interesting doco turns into another messy, barely coherent exercise in vanity by Broomfield.
A major problem is Broomfield's narration of events. His voiceover is so monotone and dull it takes monumental courage to sit through 1.5 hours in one sitting. His sentences are also so repetitive and curt they become pointless. He just keeps saying things like: ""I rang him"" ""He was not there"" ""This is David"" etc. Awful and pure torture to sit through.
As bad is the photography. There is nothing stimulating or visually arresting at all. No nice shots, no attempt to create decent cinematography. Just tedious headshots and inept mistakes. If you like endless shots of LA highway you might enjoy this.
One part of the story is interesting - the LAPDs alleged involvement with Deathrow Records. So Broomfield, as is his wont, decides to sideline this in favour of spurious interviews with glory seekers who actually know nothing or have nothing to say. It is astounding how much of the footage is of aborted meetings or interviews that say nothing yet allude to something great. No-one will say anything on film, instead it's all nudges and winks and vague allusions. And we're meant to take this seriously? I reckon all these people were having a laugh at Broomfield's expense, at least that's how it seems. In relation to the LAPD story we get the familiar dodgy lawyer and some hispanic woman who had group sex with them. It's pathetic. She reveals nothing of interest, not unlike all the other interviews and soundbites.
Broomfield's techniques are also painfully inept and annoying. His telephone call to an FBI agent is so gauche it's tempting to think the whole thing is a wind-up. Any decent doco maker would approach the matter more seriously. INstead Broomfield just puts himself in front of the camera and makes a fool of himself. Such as when he bursts into a barber and expects people to take about Biggie's shady past!
There are a dozen better docos on each day on History Channel alone. Even Broomfield has done better than this with Kurt & Courtney. Sadly Biggie and Tupac is a missed opportunity - it's tedious, shallow and takes the viewer nowhere, slowly.",1088294400,5,2197,4.845744680851064
1828311,5,B000087F6O,"Your enjoyment of Biggie and Tupac is directly related to your enjoyment of director Nick Broomfield and his bumbling passive-aggressive approach to ambush journalism. He dominates the movie, integrating himself into the story in his search to uncover the culprits behind the slaying of the Notorious BIG and Tupac Shakur, two of hip hop's brightest stars, gunned down within months of one another. Six years after the murders no arrests have been made, and while Broomfield offers some possible suspects, he stops short of any definitive conclusion.
He suggests several motives for the killings, but the point of the film is to chronicle his investigation - to present the facts and open a new dialogue about the culture of violence that is prevalent in hip hop - rather than pointing the finger at one guilty party. I find Broomfield's approach highly entertaining, and while he veers off course occasionally - there is a long pointless sequence with an ex-girlfriend of two LAPD officers allegedly tied to Tupac's murder that hinges on the sex lives of the officers, not their criminal behaviour - you have to admire his bravado in chasing down interviews in backrooms, prison yards, anywhere the story takes him. Yet there is a shocking interview with the 'Book Keeper', in his jail cell, possibly spelling out the man behind the slaying of Biggie Smalls.
In the film's final third there is an interview with Suge Knight, head honcho at Death Row Records, a leading rap label. Knight was in prison at the time, and didn't want to do the interview, but through sheer persistence Broomfield got him on camera. You can sense the tension in the sequence. The camera is noticeable jittery, as though the camera operator was have an anxiety attack while shooting, and Broomfield is unusually subdued. Knight begins benignly enough with a `message for the kids' which slowly disintegrates into a hate filled diatribe and death threat against rap artist Snoop Dogg. It is powerful footage, and worth the price of admission.",1086825600,2,2019,4.994065281899109
1828312,3,B000087F6O,"No doubt alot of new info is being exposed in this documentary...
However the movie it'self is pretty much a sloppy mess and it seems that the boys in the editing-booth forgot to erase plenty of bad stuff in the movie ,for example:
They interview a women who had a thing with one of the corrupt police's about they're sexual preference, Nick gets a listen of unreleased Pac-songs while a helicopter (chopper) is flying right above theire heads so u don't actually hear anything, u get to see Nick trying to get interviews from different people but when he doesn't get them AND STUFF LIKE THAT
In the movie NICK BROOMFIELD tries to be the new MIKE MOORE appearing in front of the camera and giving comments, He's not anything close to MIKE MOORE...  he even looks scared at times while doing an interview with Tupac's cousin MOPREME and walking in BIGGIE's hood.
The best moments is when something is actually said and they are not running around trying to get interviews or while having an interview-section asking about sex.

1828313,1,B000087F6O,"I have to say, I love Biggie and Tupac, but that was, quite possibly, the worst thing I have ever rented in my entire life. First off, the man who narrated it couldn't pronounce ""Tupac"". If that wasn't enough, he just jumped all over the place, stuck in a few interviews that had no relevance, threw in a couple scenes that made absolutely no sense, and didn't tell me ANYTHING I didn't already know. Furthermore, the man was boring to listen to, spoke in monotone, and made it evident he barely had any idea what he was talking about. If you're thinking of picking this up, think again. I suggest watching something more interesting.. like the microwave.",1071014400,,655,4.6068376068376065
