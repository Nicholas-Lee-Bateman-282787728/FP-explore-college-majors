1465655,5,B00005JL3T,"...All I can say is that it has it all.  It will frighten you...make you laugh...
and make you cry.  Those are the elements that make for a great film.
Mel Gibson has never been better.  His brother (in the film) Joaquin Phoenix is
superb...and his two children (in the film) Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin are
awesome.  I never expected this flick to be much more than another sci-fi
thriller but this one is unique.  I've never seen the twists like these in any
science fiction adaptation.
It has memories of ""War of the Worlds"", ""Children of the Corn"", ""Independence
Day"", ""E.T."" and ""Contact"".  What a hodgepodge, huh?
While most of the humor is subtle, and done with facial expressions and body
language, there are a couple of hilarious scenes.
The fright scenes are dispersed throughout.  They are creepy, unexpected and
brilliantly edited.  The sound in this film is excellent (Academy notable).
But, what surprised me most, was that the film made me cry.  I never expected
that.  Neither did the other folks in the theatre.  I heard sniffles
throughout.  All I can say is that Mel Gibson, as Father Graham Hess (that's
right - FATHER), pulls off an emotional masterpiece, filled with family love,
joy, tragedy and fear.  His little girl ""Bo"" is priceless.  What a beautiful
little girl.  She has ""star"" written all over her face...just like Kirsten
Dunst (...).
Using the Sci-Fi/Thriller chart as my barometer, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being
the highest), ""Signs"" gets a 9.25.  The acting, sound and editing all get a
""10"".
Wanna laugh?  Wanna jump in your seat?  Wanna cry?  Go see ""SIGNS"".  Then let
me know what you thought of it.",1028246400,,1640,4.72791519434629
1465656,5,B00005JL3T,"I can't remember any movie dealing with this subject matter that was this effective, or human, since ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" in 1977. That is the movie that this one will most likely be compared too. Deservedly so. What writer/director/ M. Night Shyamalan has done here is concot a real story that isn't razzle dazzle, flashy, summer invasion epic like ""Men In Black"" or ""Independence Day"", but a film that deals with a remarkable matter in a very realistic, human way. I've said 'human' twice now because that's what it is. It's not a far fetched super hero or invincible people battling aliens or doing something fantasy driven. The people here could be you or me. It is an honest look at what we ourselves would do, say, or act, if this was really happening to us. It is done here in a real way. The movie follows former preacher turned farmer Graham Hess(who is played superbly by Mel Gibson), and his two kids Morgan(Rory Culkin, Macaulay's little brother), and Bo(the unbelievebaly adorable and sweet Abigail Breslin). His little brother Merill(Joaquin Phoenix), a former baseball player, also lives with them. One typical morning, the family is awakened to strange designs in their crop fields. Crop circles. It is believed at first to be a hoax, naturally, but our family soon learns that weird things have been going on. This is no hoax. Something serious and dangerous is coming. Something is about to happen. But what?. They, nor we, don't know for sure. That's part of the fun. We don't know exactly how it'll come to an end. How it will climax. What could possibly happen?. This is a movie that would much rather creep you out with what is implied and not seen, than actually seen. It works so incredibly well. What little is seen here and there, is executed in a very scary manner. As I always say, less is better. Shyamalan knows how to use his scares in an effective way. He doesn't cram it down our throats or cheat. He lets it build and build until something is about to happen. That is his style. Slow camera angles and parts that go on a bit until the big jump. It is so good how he does it. He is a master who is only getting better. The movie is also surprisingly funny too. The humor here is not tacked on humor just to throw a little in. The humor comes from these people in a natural manner. It comes from the situations these people are in and how they react to it. Very funny. Like in his previous two films, he appears in this as well. His cameo here is much bigger and important. The cast is really good. This is easily Mel Gibson's best work in a long time. Maybe his very best in fact. He is a man who has lost his way thru a horrible accident and no longer has faith in himself. Trying to cope with his family and his loss is hard, and he fleshes that out in his character. He makes Graham Hess a real person. He is great. Joaquin Phoenix is real too. He also gets some of the best lines. The kids. M. Night knows his kid actors. You can always expect any kid in his films to be good. These two are good. The little girl is the cutest thing in the world. You'll want to take her home. Culkin is solid and watchable. How many Culkins are there?. That's about it. Not a large cast. Cherry Jones as the sheriff is the only other one. The ending might satisfy everyone. I'm fine with it myself, although a little more meat to it would've been very appreciated. It's clear what the ending was doing and trying to be, but not everyone will be up for it. There's a religion arc running thru it that won't win over any non religious people. I'm not gonna say anymore on that subject. I can only imagine the people who whine about the film do so only because they can't sustain a movie for a long amount of time that doesn't spray some kind of eye candy across their face. If you are up for an interesting and fun ride, then pass by the ones that complain the movie is slow and doesn't show enough. If it showed everything, it would've ruined the movie. These people don't know these kinds of things. In the end, this is the kind of movie that takes you on an incredible journey and stays with you. This is just like early Steven Spielberg. It is magical and memorable. My favorite film so far this year. I don't think that will change. A creepy, intriguing film that will no doubt become a late summer surprise just like ""The Sixth Sense"" was in late summer of 1999. Go see ""Signs"" and enjoy the best movie so far this summer.",1028246400,2,4463,4.358943577430972
1465657,5,B00005JL3T,"Graham Hess, an ex-reverand who lost his faith after his losing his wife, now lives with his two children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) in the middle of Pennsylvanian country. When crop circles begin to appear in his crops, weird things begin happening around his house, and then around the world. It's up to Graham to figure out what's going on to save his family before the ""signs"" reach beyond them.
 M. Night Shyamalan has definitely done it again with Signs. Dare I say, even better than before (The Sixth Sense). As it was with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Shyamalan plays with your emotions here. I went through so many emotions during Signs. The emotions were well spread out and meshed together. I laughed plenty of times at Phoenix's quirkiness and Gibson's character's shyness to cussing. I was on the verge of tears every single time someone began to shed a tear. And there was plenty of moments when I saw something on the screen that gave me thousands of chills. Shyamalan is an absolutely wonderful director. Although some people may be turned off by how much action there isn't, but no action was needed here. We had great story and character development, and great atmosphere. That's all that was needed for this movie.
 Mel Gibson, once again, portrays his character wonderfully and almost without flaw. His interaction with the children was wonderful, and as I mentioned before, when his face crinkled up to cry, I had to fight back tears. Joaquin Phoenix was great as Gibson's younger brother. He supplied a lot of the humor, but it was subtle and workable humor. But he worked the drama and fear very well too. Awesome actor. Another of the Culkin family is getting into Hollywood, and he has plenty of talent. Rory Culkin plays Gibson's thoughtful son. Culkin was very well at what he did. And the little star of Signs is Abigail Breslin. She played the daughter of Gibson's character, and her calm subtleness was great! She was adorable.
 Signs, in my opinion, is definitely one of the best movies of 2002. With it's emotional depth, chilling scares, and great acting and directing, it's definitely worthy of that opinion.",1028246400,,2188,4.8449197860962565
1465658,4,B00005JL3T,"This is the 3rd major release from M. Night Shyamalan, the 2 being Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I love this guy's movies cause he deals with paranormal, or unexplained phenomena.
This is a film about crop circles. They appear in Mel Gibson's farm crops and suspects it's just punk teenagers. Until news broadcasts start showing unidentified craft over Mexico City and other patterns in crops all over the world.
One of the key components in this film: Suggestion over Revelation. Like the Blair Witch Project, what scares you is the things you don't see or glimpse. There's several scenes in the film before the end where you don't see full view an alien, you see his leg pass into a patch of crops or a hand under a door, or when they pick up distorted sounds from a baby monitor. You do see however a full view(albeit blurry)of an alien from a home video shot at a South American birthday party. Quite freaky actually.
Don't expect another Sixth Sense with this one. It kinda lags a bit or it wouldn't explain something very clearly or it seems rather uninventive(one of the kids has asthma and naturally he has an attack at a critical moment). Or don't even expect a Sixth Sense-like ending. There's no huge revelation about one of the characters or the aliens.
But otherwise like good suspense films it gets under your skin. It'll make you nervous about a certain scene or think something will happen when it doesn't, or just not right away. But it's a entertaining film and should be seen.",1028246400,,1494,4.6415094339622645
1465659,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is more worthwhile than Unbreakable and almost on par with the Sixth Sense.  M. Night Shylaman is a gifted director, not depending on special effects to please viewers.  In signs, Mel Gibson plays a farmer, who after losing his faith, discovers crop circles in his corn field.  He rejects that they are terrestrial signs.  The acting here is superb, from Mel Gibson's mystified performance, to the child actor Rory Culkin and Joaquin Phoenix.  The suspense level is high, and the score keeps hearts pounding.  Running at about 106 minutes, the film never gets boring.  People may think so since they are so starved for special effects, but if you look for pure suspense, atmosphere, and edge-of-your-seat entertainment, Signs has it all.",1028160000,,743,5.040983606557377
1465660,5,B00005JL3T,"I loved this movie...it is literally gut wrenching...I felt like I was in the movie...I mean fearing for my life...Definately had that War of the Worlds vibe to the point of absolute realism.  Absolutely brilliant directing and acting..M. Night has a slow pace to all his movies...but it's called suspence...I was dozing in the beginning but excatly half way throught I was straight up in my chair for the rest of the flick...my stomach is still turning from worry and stress just watching it.  Just like Sixth Sense, you are just freaked out!  You'll walk out of the theater spinning.  Awesome Movie!!!!!",1027987200,22,605,4.901960784313726
1465661,5,B00005JL3T,"I mean come on I didn't see the movie back when I wrote the review I could only assume it was going to be good, and it was, the Brasilian party scene is excellent you can see it more than once and still be afraid of it, I don't know if it's the music or the footage shown but they fit well together, I found some things in the movie to be abit stupid, wouldn't you think aliens would be more advanced to protect themself from the substance that kills them, I'm not going to say what kills them but it might be abit obvious, very good movie about a man dealing with his beliefs and doesn't know what to think, fantastic movie, most people I know are afraid of the party scene and you might be too, if you don't want to watch the film at least see it for that scene.",1026086400,,764,4.0
1465662,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan, writer/director of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, has followed up with a new thriller/horror, Signs, starring Mel Gibson. Shyamalan has followed up with a film that will give audiences the chills, give 'em plenty of jolts of surprises, but also, keeps the audience on the edge of their seat asking all the questions a mystery/thriller of this kind should. The writer/director skillfully executed this movie to nearly perfection status, as Signs offers horror-filled moments as much as it does with great humorous touches.
While an idea surrounding the final segments of the film shares similarities with a past cult classic in the genre, M. Night Shyamalan proves that seeing is not always the scariest, as the filmmaker creates moments where your imagination runs free of what really is happening, allowing for a truly frightening experience at its terrifying spots.
With a concluding segment (last 15 - 20 mins) that will likely result in pure shrieking screams from millions of moviegoers, Signs could be labeled as the perfect Halloween flick, offering gut-wrenching horror moments to great comic relief. The mystery of Signs is well worth the wait and one hell of a ride, as the film stands as one of the best films in the genre.",1025481600,61,1256,5.043269230769231
1465663,5,B00005JL3T,"The Movie
Most people have heard about Crop circles and always have wondered who made them, whether they were a sign, created by an extraterrestrial, or a fraud. This movie tells the story of a father (Mel Gibbon) who lives happily with his family in a rural area in Bucks County, PA. When crop circles the size of football fields start to show up around their county and in the world in numerous amounts, people start to worry. All the animals in Bucks County start to act strange as if they would to a predator. Then citizens lives are threatened by a mysterious, opposing, terrifying alien species. Oscar caliber performances are expected to come from this electrifying, hair raising thriller by M. Night Shyamalan.
Pros:
1. Excellent plot is centered on real occurrences that even today confound the most prestigious scientists.
2. Classic portrayal of horror when the mysterious terrified is not shown on screen as a whole; this let's one imagination run wild and it's more scary than actually seeing it.
3. Mel Gibson portrays the perfect part as a father destined to protect his family at all costs.
4. Superior website let's it's audience access many extra features correlating to crop circles.
Cons:
1. None",1023235200,28,1216,4.879227053140097

1466619,4,B00005JL3T,"Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former preacher living with his two children and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) on the family farm some 45 miles from Philadelphia. His loss of faith is relatively recent--his wife died in a horrible car accident six months ago and Graham's trust in God completely vanished. Crop circles appear in the corn fields overnight. He thinks it's the work of vandals but very soon the television is reporting crop circles all over the globe, as well as other evidence of alien activity. Are they about to be invaded? Is this the end of the world?

The movie is a combination of an alien invasion thriller and an existential crisis for Graham. The alien invasion is exciting and tense, even though the story is told mostly through news coverage on television. Some aliens do show up in their area. The home siege at the end is particularly well executed, going for the ""less is more"" style famously used by The X-Files. The film also follows in the footsteps of The Twilight Zone, adding a more substantive story underneath the sci-fi trappings. Graham's loss of faith is just that--he doesn't believe God is the good and providential Person everyone assumes He is, otherwise why would He let a senseless accident rob him of his wife? Graham has taken the cross off his wall and won't waste another minute on prayer. He explains to his brother that there are two kinds of people in the world, those who take luck as a sign of someone higher up watching out for them and those who think luck is only circumstantial. The first people have a reason for hope when an alien invasion is looming. The second people have much more reason to fear. Graham puts himself in the second camp but clearly struggles with where he really stands and where his family and friends need him to be. That answer is what the movie is ultimately about.

Shyamalan is famous for his twist endings. The twist in the invasion story is a bit unbelievable though it is crafted in support of the twist in existential crisis story. I found the ending moving if not great and do heartily recommend the movie. It's not Shyamalan's best work but it is very good, like the best of The X-Files and The Twilight Zone.

I was inspired to rewatch this because Julie and Scott discussed the film on A Good Story is Hard to Find. They give the usual excellent commentary and insights.",1487203200,,2363,4.608076009501188

Nothing about it was scary, there was no plot, there was no chemistry with the actors, we barely even got to see aliens, and it's a super slow movie as a whole. The only part that scared me was when Mel Gibson saw the alien by glance the first time. But I think the worst part was the ending. It's got to be the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie. I will say Mel Gibson did a good job, he always seems to be a good actor even in his bad movies such as this one and Air America. I'm flabbergasted that anyone would even compare this movie to The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. Those two are actual good films, this one is not. The thing that bugs me the most about this film is the potential it had to be an excellent film. All the tools were right there for M Night Shyamalan, but somehow we ended up with this dud. The fact that this movie was a huge success when it came out in 2002 is very surprising, and so are the reviews praising the movie. Skip this movie, watch The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, these are movies worth your time. 2/5 stars only because Mel Gibson delivered.",1478217600,,1124,4.113636363636363

1467047,3,B00005JL3T,"Signs is a different type of alien invasion movie for sure as it's not full of special effects and big explosions, it's not an action movie it's more of a character centered movie and it works for the most part. The movie tries to make you care for the characters and it almost works, but I think Gibson's character is a just a bit wooden, but that might be the way he's supposed to be as he is suffering a major loss, but he just really seems disconnected from life and his family.
I bought it because it was on sale and I hadn't seen it in a long time and it seems I remembered it in more of a fond light that the reality. When it came out the movie was good, but it just doesn't seem to hold up. The twist ending, if you really want to call it that, doesn't make much sense and I didn't get it when I first saw it either. Aliens come and invade a planet that's over 70% water but yet water is their weakness, how does that make sense really?  They have interstellar travel and all that technology but they can't figure out that the planet they're invading is basically lethal to them?
The movie tries to make you like the characters and feel for the characters but it fails really, they're just not really believable, I don't care if they live or die, I was almost rooting for the aliens by the end of the movie.
The movie is about god and faith, Gibson's character was a preacher and he lost his faith so there's a lot of preachy bits, but it's not overly so though, it's just part of the movie.
Signs is one of those movies that's just ok really, it's not great but it's not bad either. I guess I'm happy with my purchase.",1476748800,,1627,4.132492113564669

He then said, ""That was one of the worst movie he's ever seen.""  I wished I'd listen to him and the film was just boring and stupid.  I'll admit I actually did jump during that birthday party scene.  And I'm ashamed that I did because it wasn't scary but it still got me.  How it ends leaves me asking why would aliens invade and try and conquer a world made mostly out of what's deadly to them.  My brother loved this movie at first but ended up telling me how much he regrets buying  and now he has lost all faith in the director.  I'm still confused how this made as much as it did and got the positive feedback from critics.  What Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper saw in this turd is beyond me.  Good news is the film is backlashing big time so at least that tells me everyone coming around and realizing what a terrible movie this is.

Aliens that melt when they touch water decide to invade a planet made entirely of water, butt naked, with no weapons.

WTF. How? How does this movie have so many good reviews? There is a genuine scary moment, the scene when the one guy is watching tv and sees an alien for the first time. After that the movie falls apart. Maybe if the director quit focusing on his belly button, and focused on telling a BELIEVABLE story, this wouldn't fail so bad. Except for whatever reason it did great!

If you're looking for an intelligent sci-fi movie, look elsewhere. This flick is technically Shaymalan's attempt to make an edgy, ""spiritual"" film that strokes his ego. We are all stupider for watching it, I award this movie no stars and may Shaymalan fall down the stairs and break his butt.",1471737600,3,917,4.446428571428571

The main characters are so down to earth and normal that it makes the craziness that goes on around them look even more insane. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away. So, I will just say that there is a subplot that brings light to the end of the darkness making it worthwhile to stay to the end. It's funny in place and totally understandable.

I was afraid that after so many years it would be really dated. It stands up well. If you look at it too closely, you will see that the story isn't all that logical in places, but it's a really thrilling ride nonetheless.",1459728000,11,678,4.136363636363637

As events and sightings around them become more intense they try to shut out what's happening around them, trouble is the threat
gets a whole lot closer.

The dual story of love and loss of spiritual faith and aliens is unique because of its focus on one family but with their own story while the world is under attack.

The story is fascinating, eerie and at times very funny which is hard to do in a movie like this. Of course almost all of Gibson's movies were good until he was banned by the group that he said existed in Hollywood, but they said, ""we don't exist and by the way, we ban you from making any more movies.""

 How far is their reach? Mel Gibson had become one of the most gifted filmmakers in the world... but no one can help him make, act in, produce or show any movie he might created because of raw, dangerous tribal power.

1468595,2,B00005JL3T,"Okay, so one thing you don't really want to do when you write a movie is make the audience think that you think they are stupid towards the beginning of the film. Early in this film. Mel Gibson's character is investigating a crop circle speculating about how it got there. One of the other characters says something about how all those crop circles in the UK where revealed to have been created by two guys. To which Mel Gibson says something along the lines of ""Two guys can't make crop circles all over the country in just one night"" or something to that extent. Is that how M.Night is going to tackle suspension of disbelief ? By having a character make a really logically flawed argument and expect that to establish believability ? When I first watched this film that completely ruined all my suspension of disbelief. I couldn't take any of the rest of the movie seriously, I felt like the director decided to take a chance that, as your average movie goer, I wouldn't be smart enough to recognize an argument that was both a strawman and a false dichotomy. And worst of all, this was to serve to establish the believability of the very plot device the movie was named for!

From then on movie tries very hard to rely on pathos to make whatever point it is that it's trying to make. But I'm so completely failing to suspend my disbelief at this point because of Mel Gibson's comment that I can't really help but start watching the movie with a more logical mindset. And all I can do is laugh at the characters that they would find anything about the aliens coming to earth the least bit threatening. The sheer laughable stupidity of the invading alien threat just continues to undermine my suspension of disbelief at that point. They come to earth, announce loudly ahead of time they are coming with huge crop circle we are insulted into believing they made. They don't bring any weapons or protective suits on a planet covered in a substance that literally corrodes their skin and they can't seem to use door knobs. Whatever suspense or tension may have existed when they are first revealed is quickly lost. So I find myself unable to care about the characters since I feel insulted by the main character, and I am unable to feel like they are in any real danger at any point in the film so I just get bored with their situation.",1439769600,,2335,4.507075471698113

1469045,5,B00005JL3T,"There are two things you need to know about this movie: (1) it is very well conceived, and (2) its about facing your fears.  The first time I watched it, I was drawn in by the story, of a family isolated and alone, aware they are being threatened but unaware of what it is or of the grave danger they are in.  There is the subtext of the father who after seeing his wife die loses in faith in God, and of his brother who has moved in to help him cope, and of the two children who are becoming unnerved by an unknown threat from outside while at the same time becoming unnerved by their fathers erratic behavior.  Yes, there is a pronounced creepiness to the story, because of the aliens and what they want is not revealed until the very end. The second time I watched it with the subtitles turned on I was able to determine the exact details of the story, which helped me understand what the story was really about.  After spending the night in the basement and hearing on the radio that the aliens have departed, the family believes the threat has passed and they are safe.  Then they discover one of the aliens was left behind and is in their house.  Its a powerful moment.  You can hide from your deepest fears but at some point you must face them.  Having done so, the fathers faith is restored and family life returns to normal.  Yes, Im aware of the directors preoccupation with accidents and whether or not they really are accidents but rather a part of some grander scheme.  I get it, I just don't buy it.  To me, what makes this film compelling is in how it deals with the unknown, with what we cant see, and how it plays on our fears. Yes, we can hide, but in the end we all must deal with it.  All we have to fear is fear itself, President Franklin Roosevelt told the nation, faced with the Great Depression and World War II.",1431388800,,1836,4.244252873563219

This movie will bring you to the edge of your seat. after all isn't that what most people believe that there are other more intelligent life forms out there?

The story takes a suspenseful turn with the appearance of crop circles on their farm which later builds slowly in good M. Night fashion to a discovery of aliens. Basically that's it. They figure out how to defeat the alien(s) and then its the end.

There were parts here and there that were good and some just seemed as filler while Shyalaman tried to weave a steady level of suspense to a very anticlimactic ending.",1424131200,,648,4.776785714285714

It took a subject about one of the most mysterious and potentially frightening things we've all speculated about, and confirmed all of your suspicions.

1470060,1,B00005JL3T,"The only charming thing about this movie was a throw-away line about nerds with no girlfriends who like to start secret societies.  M. Night has met the same neckbeards I have, then!  I was amused that he made a point of mocking them.  Unfortunately, the sinister cabal he evidently antagonized in real life, who would have been the subject of a much more entertaining film, has mind-controlled him into creating this, the worst movie of all time.  He shouldn't have taken his tinfoil helmet off during the horrible scenes he appeared in.

I got the impression that M. Night is a rich, spoiled suburbanite who's afraid of 1) dogs 2) farmers and 3) corn.  The midwest must terrify him!  He doesn't seem to know that the religious country folks he's portraying so insultingly are generally heavily-armed, tough as nails, and band together as a community in times of crisis.  What they do not do is hide with their televisions under the stairs when their country is being invaded.  That's what his pretentious occultist neckbeard friends would do, though.  There's a reason hicks are usually portrayed as forming vigilante mobs armed with torches and pitchforks (though in this case supersoakers would have been a nice touch).  This ain't the suburbs - these folks don't hide in their basements until there's a tornado.

Also, if I see one more ""zombie"" movie where the asthmatic kid doesn't bother to grab an inhaler before fleeing, there will be consequences.  Do not anger me.  I have Psychic Powers.

This movie is a deliberate insult to heartland America.  And Christianity.  Look, you angry, impotent, anxiety-ridden and heavily-medicated girlyman: if you think so little of the US you can always move back to India and find out what they think of privileged, conceited douchebags and their paranoid mystical fantasies in those farming communities.  Maybe they grow less corn, the most intrinsically terrifying plant on Earth.  They have tigers, though, so you'll still probably be looking for a small enclosed place into which to drag your televisions set.  Please take your neckbeard atheist hipster friends with you.  They probably fantasize about hanging out in ashrams anyway, and would be doing so already if only they could afford to move out of their mothers' basements where they hunch over their computers giving your horrible movies 5-star reviews.",1406937600,,2362,5.036082474226804

Joaquim Phoenix plays Mel's brother Merrill, oddly, the one who truly tries to hold the family together.

1470548,2,B00005JL3T,"Unlike Shyamalan's later films, which combine interesting atmospherics and weirdly menacing scenarios that are psychologically believable, this one is a run-of-the-mill alien invasion flick.  It starts off strong, with a mystery as to why aliens are choosing to make first contact with earth, which is evidenced by crop signs.  Gibson is a fallen preacher and widower; at first he is skeptical, then listens to his children and begins to get scared as more happens.  With his loss of faith, he feels there is nothing that can help, so is fatalistic and frightened when they turn out to have bad intentions.  By that point, the film has degenerated into such a cliche that there is nothing whatsoever interesting about it - no surprise actions or reasons, just facing the baddies by baseball-bat force.  I found this deeply disappointing, given the talent of the actors.  Gibson's inevitable spiritual rebirth is laughably predictable and unoriginal.

Make no mistake, there are very different colors of thread interwoven in this story, and the result is a powerful movie.

1470827,1,B00005JL3T,"Yeah, this is not an alien invasion movie: it's a meditation on faith and how everything happens for a reason.
Okay, if you say so. Pretentious beyond words, the only thing that redeems it is Mel Gibson: his acting serves
as the lynchpin for a movie whose plot contrivances and ludicrous script would make anyone wish for an alien
invasion, if only to see director M Night Shyamalan become the first ""specimen"" those extraterrestrials came after.

Some nice special effects sequences (courtesy Industrial Light and Magic) and occasional moments of
directorial tension (which isn't that hard to achieve, when you are plagiarizing classic cinema devices wholesale)
cannot compensate for gaping holes of plausibility. Memo to Shyamalan - there's a difference between
suspension of belief and suspension of logic: i.e., aliens invade a planet whose surface is 70% water, when
that element is lethal to their physical survival? Exactly which celestial trailer park did these aliens emigrate from?

But again, this movie isn't about aliens, it's about losing one's religion, only to gain it back again through
the understanding of how even the most traumatic events are actually teachable moments designed to make
us stronger and more resilient. If I want thinly-veiled religious tracts masquerading as cinematic entertainment,
I'll watch the dramas on Daystar, thank you.",1385164800,2,1366,5.348837209302325
1470828,5,B00005JL3T,"First off, this is NOT a sci-fi movie.  This is a movie about belief that is masquerading as a sci-fi movie.  The whole alien invasion plot is not the plot.  The plot is one man's failure of faith and what happens to renew that faith.  This is a movie about how the universe works in mysterious ways and how all things are connected...not a movie about crop circles and aliens and the threat of invasion by forces from another planet.

This movie might as well have been about an invasion of squirrels from another dimension as aliens from another planet.  That was not and is not the point of the movie so there's little to be gained from pointing out plot holes regarding the aliens.  Because this not what this movie is about.

That being said, the first time I saw the movie I didn't get it and I saw the same plot holes and was a bit spooked by the aliens, but overall not too impressed...right up until the end of the movie, when it finally dawned on me that the movie I was watching wasn't the movie I thought I was watching.  Which is completely and utterly brilliant!  I sat up and grinned madly and was completely enthralled by the realization of what the movie was really saying!

Mel Gibson plays a religious man who falls from faith due to the death of his wife.  He and his kids and his brother--who lives with them in the farmhouse--have been wrapped up in pain and loss and disappointment ever since.  His brother never made anything of himself re baseball and regrets it.  His kids have physical and psychological issues that their father can't deal with.  Then a crop circle appears, there is ""something"" running around in the cornfields...and they find themselves under attack in their own home (while they get occasional tidbits of info that the whole world is under attack).

There are quite a few spooky moments in this movie, so its not one for younger kids.  That being said, even older kids might not get what this movie is really about...but will simply see it as a family fighting off aliens.  If that's their thing the might like it.  But for those who see the movie for what it really is, this can be a profound experience.

I have watched this movie several times now and recommended it to people, especially those who are going through some trials and doubts regarding belief and their place in the universe.  Along those lines, some of the same currents in this movie also appear in ""V for Vendetta,""--the mysterious way the universe functions and how all things that may appear separate are really interconnected.

Highly recommended...for just the right audience.",1383523200,,2597,4.6
1470829,4,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" (2002) is about a disillusioned minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in the neighboring cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!

Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: 1.) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And 2.) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.

The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give in to the former.

This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.

Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the ""father of lies"".

There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called ""the prince of the power of the air"" in the bible). The primitive method of harming the aliens is discovered in the Middle East and is holy water. The daughter was said to be a ""gift from God"" who was sensitive to impure water. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God to speak to him. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the ""aliens"" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.

Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.

***END SPOILER***

There are many other clues, but I don't want to spoil the fun of finding them for yourself.

I'm not saying that this is the only interpretation of the film, but rather that it's a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.

I should add that I don't feel ""Signs"" is a great movie despite being impressed with its hidden meaning and potent themes. I give it a solid grade mostly for these reasons but, honestly, I don't find the film all that compelling. While watching it, I don't feel much for Gibson's struggle and grief; better writing would've made me feel for his situation, like Ted Danson in ""Loch Ness"". Also, the story plays out in a generally boring manner, the characters don't really trip my trigger and I was never seriously creeped-out by the creatures. At the same time, the movie's not bad and I especially like the reverent ambiance, which most of Shyamalan's films possess.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a cool Shyamalan film and is about on par with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village"" (and, yes, I realize a lot of people despise the latter, but I'm not one of them).

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.

1470886,5,B00005JL3T,"In this reviewer's opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS (2002) is his very best film.

With Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones and the director himself, as a guilt-ridden man who fell asleep behind the wheel and caused an accident that has caused Reverend Graham Hess (Gibson) to lose much more than his faith in the Almighty.

Graham can no longer function as a minister, and now believes hiimself an atheist. He hasn't any qualms about cursing a God that would allow such tragedy to occur.

Phoenix, as Merrill Hess, Graham's younger brother, is a failed minor league baseball player. His weakness was swinging at bad pitches and striking out too much. But when Merrill connected... that pill flew a mile!

On a lazy late summer day in rural Pennsylvania, eerie things start occurring on the Hess farm: a family dog goes violently mad, crop circles appear in the corn field, and seemingly invisible late night prowlers make their ghostly presence known. The TV and radio are flooded with similar reports. We soon learn that these night creatures are hostlie extraterrestrials. A full scale invasion of Earth (a la ""The War of the Worlds"") is on, and the Hess family (and their neighbors) will soon be under siege.

Besides being an excellent story with superior cinematography, this M. Night-mare's brilliant orchestration (by James Newton Howard) adds to the terror.

Kudos to casting director Douglas Aibel for pairing Gibson and Phoenix. They truly look like brothers and have great on-screen rapport.",1381190400,8,1542,5.075098814229249

For everything that it does right, it does just as many things completely wrong.  The plotting is a little heavy-handed and plodding, slapped around by one flashback too many at all the wrong times.  Sometimes it's a bit too coy with the suspense then it clumsily shoves it right in your face.  The worst performance of the piece was the stiff unnatural turn by director M. Night Shyamalan who should have fired himself and hired someone that could actually assemble enough attributes to appear lifelike.  The best performance was done by the magnificent Cherry Jones as police office Caroline Paski (more scenes of her character would have been greatly appreciated).  Best use of a cornfield, I'll admit that (and as someone who once ran through a cornfield, let me tell you, it hurts!).  As an almost `end of the world' scenario, it was quite effective.  On the whole, the good points overruled the bad, enough that I quite like this film and upgraded it to the Blu-ray version for repeated viewings in the future.",1379894400,6,1166,4.7611940298507465

1470893,3,B00005JL3T,"A movie I had been wanting to see based on outstanding comments from fellow horror aficiandos, I was left dissapointed and half way empty. Not a bad movie by itself, it didn't rub me the right way for several reasons, and I thought it had the potential to be more than it was.

 A good part are the aliens when actually shown. Ultra creepy, realistic. The buildup around their appearance is top-notch; the flashes around their forms at the right moments in the right lighting with the right music or tension ws CREEPY! Especially the scene involving Graham and the pantry. The cornfield scene is quite suspenseful and there is enough of unanswered quetions that leave us sitting with a sort of morbid curiosity.

 There was a large subplot of religion and the loss of faith. Graham was an ex minister who bagn losing his way after the tragic and heartening death of his wife. The movie features several philosophical discussions concerning Christianity and the ending brings it all to a head.

 Unlike alien invasion movies like Independence day this one shows the encounter through only the eyes of this one family. It doesnt really show, besides brief news cast, how others are affected or coping. This is an interesting technique in that its more personalized, more documentary-like.

 The cast was convincing. Mel Gibson, known for his intense screen image, gives us Graham Hess. His brother is played by Joaquin Phoenix and is a likeable character, if not THE most likeable. The two children are Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). The children aren't annoying, which means they're good.

 This is a slower paced very quiet tone movie that is sort of like The Others in the theme. Besides some frightening scenarios I grew bored with a lot of it. I am all for slower films and serious drama like scenarios but this one was a bit too damp for me. I know half of the world seems to disagree and that I am in the majority. Strange as I usually don't find films boring that others do.

 There was some dry serious humor, some of it really was cute. So overall not a bad flick just not as good as I was expecting. Good cast but not a very interesting direction.",1379635200,,2172,4.642297650130549

[SPOILER ALERT! But if you haven't already wasted your time watching this insufferable movie, you'll thank me for 'spoiling' it for you.]

Fatal Plot Flaw: In the end, the aliens are defeated because water is deadly to them. It burns them like acid.

Yes, I said WATER.

Presumably, these are highly advanced beings from another world, people who are intelligent enough to build ships capable of crossing interstellar space, yes?

So... exactly why would they choose to invade a planet where 70% of the surface is covered with a substance that KILLS them on contact? Indeed, water sometimes falls from the very sky on Earth. Why would they ever even set foot on this planet?

One rain cloud, and the invasion (and this idiotic movie) would have been over!

Did the aliens not bother to investigate Earth before invading? They certainly spent a lot of time at the beginning of the movie making crop circles all over the place -- did they somehow fail to notice all the water, oh, EVERYWHERE?

I repeat for emphasis: WATER KILLS THEM. The extraterrestrial invaders could have been fought off with a garden hose.

It is an unforgivable plot contrivance, so completely and appallingly STUPID that it renders all other questions about the movie irrelevant.

And if your standards are so low that you can swallow such idiocy, then you're not likely to care about the movie's many other flaws anyway.",1370822400,2,1762,4.691558441558442
1471118,3,B00005JL3T,"A talented Director and a talented Actor just can't make this film about faith rise above its fundamental failings. Both these central figures cannot make the story come to life, can't endow it with the energy that is needed to make it work. I, at any rate, never felt that we were getting anywhere, advancing toward what was the inevitable goal, visible from the moment we learn that the Gibson character was a minister who had lost his faith. When the denouement is reached and progresses to its end, I felt that the artificiality of the entire scenario still had not much sparked beyond that achieved by many a programmer (B picture) since the beginning of the movies. Frankly, Gibson tried very hard to be the Minister who had lost his heart and lost his faith, he is capable of a great deal as an actor, but he never made the material work. My opinion is that the fault was not his. The kids verged on being very good, but, once again, the weight of what they had to do and say, ultimately did them in. As for the part of the Minister's  younger brother, that was a lost cause from the beginning. This was not a guy who had ever starred in anything and never would convincingly be heroic. Insofar as there are other characters, they shared very little of the film; except for the lady sheriff, no more than one appearance in cameo roles. The lady sheriff is the only role that came off as it should have, whether due to the talent of the actress or the features of the role, I cannot say.
All in all,  it is not a bad picture, just not a good one either; certainly, not as good as the possibilities. Gibson is a guy who can be very good indeed, but he can be the opposite as well: that is, he is a guy who is only as good as the material he gets.

The score I thought was very eerie and fit the tone perfectly. The acting was fine from most of the cast. There are a lot of problems story wise. Plus the twist at the end is quite lame.

Mel Gibson, back before he went looney, does fine here. Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as well. I grew to like both characters throughout the film. The little girl I found annoying though. Rory Culkin, I felt was a bit wooden acting-wise. However, I found them both to be tolerable.

The quality that this movie has most going for it is the atmosphere. The atmosphere is great and really draws you in, which is helped by the score. The design of the alien I did not mind either. If you are expecting a big alien invasion film like War of the Worlds look elsewhere. This film is mostly about this family and how they coup and deal with the situation of the alien attack.

The problems with the film come from the aliens themselves. The aliens seem to be very primitive for an advanced alien race that is supposedly more advanced than we are. The alien's weakness that is revealed at the end also raises a lot of questions.

Overall despite its problems I definitely recommend that you see this film at least once. Signs is Shyamalan at his best!",1367971200,2,1405,4.351145038167939

Though my comments here thus far have nothing to do with this film, I do have to comment that it seems like so many athiests seem to have a real chip on their shoulders now days. In fact though the religious messages are clear in this film, it sounds like our athiest here is bothered by the fact that Mel Gibson's character didn't stay an athiest by the end of the film. It wasn't enough that he had been a priest then turned into an athiest and stayed that way through nearly the entire film, this guy is upset that he chose to go back toward God at the end. Oh how sad :P I don't know what is with these athiests and their preaching their No God sermons, but its begining to wear me pretty thin. Yes I believe in God, but I don't feel the need to rant about it every time I review a movie. And I will never understand why these people fight so hard to believe in absolutely nothing. We live, we die, that's it. Seems like it takes more faith to believe there is no God than to believe there is one. Go figure. But I wish they wouldn't parade their anti-religious beliefs while reviewing a movie. It's extremely annoying. :( Now that I have said what needs to be said, I did find this film pretty interesting. This is not Spielberg territory here, but the film is filled with some great creepy moments, excellent direction, great acting, and some good thrills along the way. I really quite enjoyed it.

After several viewings of M. Night Shyamalan's movies I have come to the firm determination that most of them get better with repeated viewings.  (That is, all except ""Lady in the Water.""  She arrived DOA.)

It is true of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unbreakable-Blu-ray/dp/B00121QGV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unbreakable [Blu-ray</a>], which I thought was VERY slow.  It was definitely true of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village-Widescreen-Vista-Series/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)</a>, which I HATED the first time I saw it.  It was also true of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001HOZWUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>, which I thought had an excellent buildup and then just petered out to nothing.

And it is true of this movie, which I was really torn about when I first saw it. During that first viewing I found I really loved ""Signs""...that is, until I was REALLY let down at the end.

Since then, my feelings about it are still mixed, but they aren't so strong anymore. And, as with the other films I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I feel the merits of the film outweigh its shortcomings.

When first I saw ""Signs"" I was enraptured by the signature Shyamalan slow pacing, the gradual psychological buildup.  If you've seen ANY Shyamalan movie you know what I'm speaking of: the gentle introduction of one plot element, then the next--for instance, the ""Signs"" themselves: the crop circles, the news broadcasts, the noise over the baby monitors, and then finally the sounds of footsteps around the characters' house.  It's these little accumulations that make us believe in the alien presence.  Even the aluminum foil the frightened family members wear upon their heads is eerie and helps us believe, as the path that they are on is entirely human and ordinary.  We would do much the same.

Certainly the fact that Graham, a former preacher, has lost his faith due to the loss of his wife in a horrific accident seems believable--in fact, I had no problem with that upon my initial viewing. I was not overly happy with the notion that the wife somehow predicted all the key points of the ending once she was hit by the car...while it seemed far-fetched, at least them movie predicted that resistance from the onset, asking whether you were the kind of person who saw signs and miracles, or the kind who saw coincidences?  It was, after all, pretty much the point of the movie.

However, I STILL have a problem that the aliens--who one would have to believe SHOULD have done SOME planning for their invasion before they got here, and that in all that planning they somehow overlooked the very substance that accounts for some 70 percent of the planet...WELL, THAT STILL BOTHERS ME!

But, as I've said, I have gained a better perspective on this movie, and I think that my problem (and the problem of a lot of other people) is the same as Shyamalon's, and it is that we are hung up on the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>&nbsp;and are, whether we admit it or not, looking to Shyamalan to repeat that success each time out. It's like asking a batter for nothing but home runs, or a scientist to continuously win Nobel prizes.  He wrote and directed one EXTRAORDINARY film, and we all expect him to hit it out of the park with every movie.

It's unfair, but the problem is not just ours...Shyamalan compounds it with every movie he makes, each of them trying to slowly build up to a ""trick"" at the end, some amazing conclusion that will knock our socks off each time.

I'm glad to find out, though, that upon further viewings my outlook has become more accepting as to the merits of his films.  Seeing them with a much less hopeful approach softens my negativity; now that I realize that it's not going to be another ""Sixth Sense"" I stop trying to pigeonhole it, and it gives his movies a distinctly new advantage.

Try it...I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1357430400,,4321,5.466165413533835
1471475,5,B00005JL3T,"I like M. Night's movies. I know some people don't, but I do. I didn't have a copy of either movie, so I looked for a cheap way to get them.
This is really the way to go. Buy them used if it doesn't matter to you and you get two movies while only having to pay shipping for one.
I would recommend this for people who use DVD binders/boxes since you only have one case to ditch when you've transferred them instead of two. 50% less plastic usage.
I wish they made more DVD sets like this.",1357084800,,487,3.979591836734694
1471476,5,B00005JL3T,"My husband and I love this movie because it reminds us of the Power of God.  It takes a sci-fi and makes it about love, loss, family, but most of all, everything happens for a reason.",1356998400,2,183,4.083333333333333
1471477,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is a great film.  Very intense, and yet, it is all tied together.  Much better than some of Shyamalan's recent movies (i.e., The Happening).",1356652800,,146,4.8
1471478,4,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is listed as a science fiction thriller, but I believe that is not really the correct genre.  I would call this a ""religious"" movie - if it were still legal in the US to use that word - and so instead I'll call it a ""faith-based thriller.""

Since the screenplay was written by M. Night Shyamalan - and directed by him as well, of course (with his standard cameo) - you know that it will have a twisteroo at the end, and this film is no exception.  Now, I myself am not a big fan of twisteroos, unless they are done well.  Films such as ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""The Village"" were three of his other films with a twist that I really liked, with obviously ""The Sixth Sense"" being my favorite.  So to Mr. Shyamalan:  ""Keep twisting away.""

The actors here are very good, but that's not a surprise since it has such a good cast.  Mel Gibson, despite what people say about him, has quite a bit of talent, probably more in the direction department than acting.  Joachin Phoenix, despite having ""gone off the rails"" (the media's words, NOT mine) always gives it a go.  And seeing Abigail Breslin when she was young (how ironic is that statement?) was a treat.  If you haven't seen ""Little Miss Sunshine"" I urge you to check it out NOW.  One of the funniest comedies.  Ever.  And the surprising thing is:  this film is actually very funny as well, for at least the first couple of acts.  I had some good laughs until that point.  Then it tries to become more scary.

I do have some issues with this film though, of course.  There are a couple of plot devices that I found to be a little, well, corny, which fits since the film was shot mostly on a farm.  Also, when the film ends, there is still a major issue on a global scale that seems unresolved to me.  It's hard to describe what that lack-of-resolution is without giving things away, so that's all that I will say.

But still, I believe that ""Signs"" is a 3.5, but I'll round up today since I mostly had a good time watching.",1356048000,,1993,4.315363881401617

1471481,5,B00005JL3T,"I know some people complain about a supposed lack of explanation in the film, but I feel like we receive everything we really need to know.  I love this movie; perhaps because I didn't go into it with a ton of knowledge regarding what it was about, so the beautiful storyline of Mel Gibson's family took me by surprise.  I cried.  The aliens themselves were well done and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a Joaquin Phoenix role more than this one.  There's a lot of subtlety to this film, rather than in your face effects.  The female police chief also did a stellar job helping to move the story line along.

I will say there were a couple of gratuitous dog deaths - only one of which you see the results on screen - so I would say it's not appropriate for children.

However, if you enjoy alien movies, M. Night movies, crisis of faith movies, or movies that make you think, I don't think you can go wrong with this one.",1354406400,,921,4.289017341040463
1471551,3,B00005JL3T,"This is my favorite kind of scary movie: suspense and tension, as opposed to gore and violence. ""Signs"" had all the suspense: things jumping out at you, things you thought were going to jump out at you, and even things that were trying to jump out at you. (The aliens had a tendency to get caught behind closed doors a lot.) I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It also had comic relief mixed in at opportune moments.

I don't really have anything to say that other reviewers haven't already covered. I really enjoyed the movie. It is just those few pesky plot holes that keep me from giving it the full 4-5 stars. Mainly the water thing. After watching a good movie, that made the ending seem a little too quick and easy. And the asthma thing. As someone with asthma, that whole scene seemed off to me. And since that was practically the entire reason WHY, well, that messed up the explanation for me a bit.

Man if the cloth loses his faith with the untimely death of his wife. Gets it back as he sees that seemingly unrelated instances may be part of a bigger plan.  Oh yes, aliens invade Earth.

Not a bad film, but if you are prone towards non-belief, the movie will be tedious. If you are prone towards belief(s), then you may enjoy the parallel plot. BTW, the 1950's WOTW was full of McCarthy-era religion.  Still a better job than that disaster that Spielberg did.

But [spoiler] IF the bad aliens couldn't handle water, how come they didn't SEE that the planet was 2/3 water?  How could they breath the humidity in the air?  OK, I'll suspend disbelief...it's only a movie.  And was creepy at times.",1354320000,,714,4.566929133858268
1471553,3,B00005JL3T,"M Night Shyamalan uses the psyche of his audience against them. He uses what's not on screen to pump fear into their hearts; suggestive music, lighting and camera angles to build a sense of dread where there is nothing to fear. So the monster in Signs; a movie that drags along at a slow methodical pace; doesn't show itself until the end. And even then, it's mostly hidden in shadowy TV-screen reflections.

The problem for Shyamalan is that it isn't scary. It is somewhat suspenseful, yes. The ending, in which the Hess family borders all the windows and doors of their Philadelphia home and hides in the basement, reminds me of the classic Night Of The Living Dead. But, despite a plot that has reptilian space aliens traveling to Earth from presumably light years away, it wastes too much of its time not really going anywhere.

1. The video shot of the alien at the birthday party - unique/very frightening.
2. The odd way wife was injured/died - unique

CONS
1. Any show where a family knows there is danger and deliberately locks their dogs up in a garage ALONE with no way to escape the horror of these creatures killing them, deserves no higher than a one rating.  This worthless family at least could have let the dogs loose outside to run and hide and have a chance at life.

2. Genetically defective family
  a) the girl is homely, not very bright, mentally defective (leaves glasses of water everywhere, etc), is a terrible actress and dresses like an idiot.
  b) the boy is also homely but physically defective with severe asthma and while he studies books to understand the aliens, he isn't all that bright because he runs around in tin foil hats.
  c.  the brother is ugly as sin and his hair lip genetic physical defect does not help in the looks department either and he is also not that bright.

His faith is shaken as he cannot understand how God can do such terrible things to a man that has given his life to God. He and his brother are living on a farm in Pennsylvania trying to raise his young son and daughter. Behind his home and yard is a massive corn field. He thinks he sees something in the corn and the dogs are acting strangely. He wanders into the field and finds a large crop circle not far from his house.

That night his young daughter wakes him up and tells him she saw a monster outside the house. While he comforts her and tries to get her back into bed he sees a shadow of a figure on top of the barn. He wakes his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and they run around the house trying to trap who they think is a prankster. The prankster escapes and they call the sheriff the next day thinking they should report it.

Their dogs start acting funny and nervous and Graham goes outside into the corn field shout to the pranksters that they should leave and stop wasting their time trying to scare them when he hears a strange noise and sees a non-human green leg sticking into a corn row. Terrified he runs inside and finds the family watching TV and seeing reports of strange UFO's appearing all over the world...

Yes, we know, one of the biggest in-your-face blunders of this movie is that these supremely intelligent aliens with advanced technology and amazing problem solving skills decide to invade a planet that's 80% water when the aliens themselves are... easily killed by water. Yup. Just splash it on their skin and they burn up like vampires being doused with Holy Water. It's also never explained just WHAT the aliens want; to dine on our flesh? Harvest our natural resources? Have a big Earth-themed alien party? All we know is that they invade and start killing people, but we never find out WHY.

But seriously, blunders aside... this is one FUN creep-you-out movie! The music, the visuals, the story's pace, the camera shots, all designed to just absolutely give you the ""holy crow, something weird and freaky is happening"" feeling, all the way through the movie. Helping it along is some superb acting by some true Hollywood talent, including Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin, all of whom do an incredible job (the kids are just as fantastic as the adults).

The decisions to NOT show the aliens makes them all the more creepy and mysterious. Granted, we do have the final alien encounter at the end, which I found completely UN-creepy and anti-climactic. I wish they'd found another way to conclude the story without that whole scene, which is just tacky and corny. Enjoy the first three-quarters of the movie anyway! The one scene with the news reel playing from the South American children's party where the first alien is glimpsed... that still gives me the heebie jeebies every time! Same with the scene where they're in the car with the baby monitor and pick up the first, faint, strange sounds... is it something alien? Static? Interference? The suspense between ""Listen closer! Find out what it is!"" and ""NO, turn it off, we don't WANT to know what it is!"" is just delightfully tense.

So yeah, it's lacking a lot of common sense, but it's still an awesomely creepy story filled with excellent acting. Can't say that about many alien flicks. This one doesn't bank on special effects, guts, lasers, explosions, or chase scenes. This one revolves around home, family, faith, and what lies in the darkness just beyond the reach of your back porch light...",1342656000,,2307,4.892583120204604

Shyamalan portrays this insufferably dehumanizing mental state by his film's allegorical monster figure of an extra-terrestrial wraith possessing infinite and pitiless brutality, personifying a Godless universe. This appears to become a catastrophic predicament affecting the entire world's population.  This fine DVD  recreates the whole human condition  of inner distress and emotional turmoil, relief and personal restoration,allegorically presented by this intensely-inspired film-maker.",1341187200,,747,6.525252525252525
1471623,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shamalan (did I spell that right?) has a particular ""niche"" he writes for...  the ""twist-ending"" film.  His first major film, ""The Sixth Sense,"" was magnificent, and I really loved ""Unbreakable"" as well.  This is the other Shamalan film I really like.  (Others, such as ""The Happening"" and ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" are quite a bit more underwhelming in my opinion, though they're not nearly as bad as some reviewers would lead you to believe!)

This film is really a classical fairy tale...  a term that may make people come to the wrong conclusion if I don't explain.  See, real ""fairy tales"" aren't what we often think of by that term today.  We think of them as being set ""in another time and place"" because most of those we know are set in our past, in a situation which to use seems strange.  But at the time that the stories came into being, they were cast in the actual work in which the listener to the tale was familiar.  They also tended to be quite dark, and often rather frightening and violent, not remotely like the ""Disney-fied"" version we often think of today.

Basically, a ""fairy tale"" introduced a magical or supernatural element into the world that the audience was familiar with, and usually posed a a morality tale with great trial and danger, sometimes leading to a heroic victory (and maybe even a ""happily ever after"" though that's really part of the ""Disney-fication"" I mentioned earlier most of the time!) but at least as often, a tragic morality tale.

This story is a modern fairy tale.  Yes, it's aliens instead of gnomes or succubi or fairies or witches or whatever...  but they serve the same purpose in the story.  The ""heroes"" aren't really glorious heroic figures, but are common people, going through a very personal trial... one which can either be overcome or which can prove out as a ""tragic morality tale""

At the core of this story, and part of what some of the audience disliked about the flick, is the idea that ""there are no coincidences.""  The lead character is a former minister who lost faith due to a personal tragedy.  I know that some folks I know really liked that aspect of the character at first... and they were the ones who hated the movie the most once it was done...  because this is, in the end, a POSITIVE morality tale, about how even the most inconsequential-seeming (or even annoying) things in your life can, in the end, prove to be there for a reason.

This movie has a hopeful ending, and is very much ""pro-faith.""  If that appeals to you, you'll enjoy the movie.  If you're one of those people who find the concept of ""faith"" to be something you associate (wrongly, I'd argue) with stupidity, you'll almost certainly hate everything about this film.

Finally... this isn't an action movie, or a horror movie.  Yes, there's a global invasion going on, but every bit of this movie is small, and personal.  It's about what goes on INSIDE of a person, not what's going on outside.  It's a deeply emotional film, but if you expect an action-adventure film, you'll be very disappointed.

I recommend this film, and have shared it with a number of friends and family members who never saw it...  for various reasons.  Virtually all appreciated it, except for a couple of folks I know who have a passionate hatred of the concept of faith (and who falsely associate that with being ""anti-intellectual"" or ""anti-science"" or whatever other nonsense they use to prop up their own faith-based belief that there ""is no God."")",1339113600,3,3499,4.66231647634584

1471626,4,B00005JL3T,"I like director M. Night Shyamalan's films. I don't pretend to understand them, but I like them. A lot.

Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) was a priest (presumably Episcopalian) until his wife Colleen was killed in a rather absurd accident. She had been walking by the side of the road when neighbor Ray Reddy (played by Shyamalan) lost control of his truck and pinned her, nearly cutting her body in half. She survived long enough to talk to her husband for a couple of minutes after he was summoned to the scene by the local police.

Then Hess quit the church and concentrated on raising his two adorable children, the older boy Morgan (maybe six or seven) and the little girl Bo (maybe three or four). They lived on a farm and grew corn, and Hess's brother Merrill returned home to help him.

But one morning they find that their corn fields have been sculpted into what are known as crop circles, but which was actually a fairly elaborate design of several circles of different sizes with other details to the configuration. Naturally, the brothers Hess assume it is the work of pranksters. Before long, however, evidence mounts that there was more to it than a high school prank. A lot more.

The story is as much about the relations of the two brothers, the children, and the pain Graham Hess suffered that caused him to curse God and leave the church. I will not attempt to describe all of that, except to say that it is a good story which is decidedly not predictable. Yes, some elements are relatively conventional in science fiction movies, but much is decidedly original. Also, the emotional and spiritual aspects are every bit as important as the apparent alien invasion.",1336780800,,1674,4.664406779661017

This movie gripped me from the minute it started and didn't let go till it was over.  The knock some have regarding the director's focus on atmosphere I don't understand - that focus is part of what makes this a wonderful film. This is one of those films where everything isn't spelled out.  You understand without everything needing to be said, and that is what pulls you in; in a way it made me think of Hitchcock.  I love the story and the way it's told.  And this may sound crazy, but the closing scenes of the film leave me feeling a bit emotional.

I've seen this film a few times over the years.  While after the first viewing the surprise aspect is reduced as with any film, it still holds up to multiple viewings, at least for me.  BTW, this is not a horror movie, it's really more of a suspense film and a story about faith.  Highly recommended.

A word on the Blu-Ray
They did an excellent job on the Signs blu-ray version.  The picture quality is wonderful, and the lossless audio track is excellent - tastefully done without hitting you over the head to provide an immersive surround audio experience that matches the film.

And what I personally found to be a refreshing change from other flicks I have seen that have dealt with a similar theme is that this movie is just as entertaining as it is enlightening. It shines a bright flashlight upon the inner roller coaster of faith and yet gently illuminates in a subtle way that I found to be neither preachy or condescending. I also enjoyed the light-hearted moments in this movie well executed by a superb cast of talented actors portraying likable characters blending in just enough humor to balance out some of the more seriously intense scenes of dramatic tension.

My dream had happened sometime after I had seen Shamalamadingdong's second newest film, The Happening, where a toxin is released and people commit suicide. That film is guilty a thousand times over of assuming its audience is a group of dumbarses who believe every single bit of detail a movie tells them. Oh and let's not forget Shamalama's previous fiasco, The Village, which may be even worse for that. Except at least I liked the atmosphere of The Village.

The irony here is that both of the mentioned movies are directed by the same person who directed Signs. Okay, let's also take the time to observe the pattern- each movie got worse as it got along. What am I saying: This movie is logically the best one of that horror trilogy but that doesn't say much.

Here we have a family whose daddy was a preacher. Apparently he left the priesthood after his wife died yet he is still referred to as father. Bo, the girl, has a water problem, thd young brother has a problem with asthma, and the other brother... OK not sure since he isn't well developed. OK so looking past the priest problem, we have a strong start. They find a series of crop circles containing navigation signs, meaning there are aliens attacking them. Cool eh? Not when we find out some information about the aliens.

Before the big spoiler (Actually please do read this review before you see the movie because I'm about to save you time and/or money), let me explain a huge flaw: So they have a fancy UFO. And they walk around naked (I'll explain why that's a flaw after the jump). And they use crop circles as navigation signs. And they have a poison that sprays out of their wrists (that somehow only affects Bo...??????). And they make trilling noises. And they can run at breakneck speed (so can the middle child, despite having asthma).

But they can't break through wooden doors???? SERIOUSLY??? These strong aliens are apparently so evil but they can't break through doors????? They're strong enough to form giant crop circles in the cornfield but not strong enough to break through a freaking wooden door???

Well, here's the spoiler: They are affected by water.

Yeah, that's right. Water is their weakness.

How is that a problem?

-Now, the nudity problem. They can walk around naked and not be cold BUT THEY ARE AFFECTED BY WATER.

-And what about the one scene where it appears to be raining? Where do they hide?

Remember The Wizard of Oz? Yeah. I am calling this a ripoff of that movie. I'm surprised the aliens don't scream ""I'm MELTING! I'M MELTING!!!!!"".

I learned something from this BD: not all BDs have an amazing definition, even if there's a ""1080p"" in the cover. In this case I was disappointed by the video resolution (specially in darker scenes) as I compared it to other BD movies. This may be related to the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 being zoomed to fit my 16:9 screen or just to the quantity of dark scenes contained in the movie. In lighter, outdoor scenes the resolution improves a little bit but don't expect bright-colored, Avatar-like video definition.

Now, this is not the worst BD ever in the history of video quality. There is an improvement from the DVD definition as the BD reveals many unnoticed details that can be appreciated with a fair HDTV with HDMI connection. My recommendation is that you buy this BD only if you're a huge fan of the movie or if you find it at reduced price and don't have a DVD copy.

1471853,1,B00005JL3T,"Warning: spoiler. Only read this review if you've already seen the movie.

I don't believe this is SCIENCE fiction. At best, it is fantasy. Water does the aliens in. That in itself is completely preposterous. Water is pervasive in the universe and it is inconceivable that creatures who live at ""room temperature"" (Earthly ""rooms"") would be destroyed by water. All creatures from wherever they are in the universe who could walk the Earth without ""space suits"" would depend on water for their very existence. So introducing that concept is just the ""War of the Worlds"" device used to get rid of the aliens and save the world. Because of that, the fact that this is an ""alien invasion"" movie is almost irrelevant. What's left is simply wrong-headed.

So at best the details of the aliens are irrelevant to what this movie has to say, which to me is simply blasphemous. What I don't like about it are the religious implications of the nature of God, as if God would cause great suffering in the past so that people could be redeemed in the future. If God is like this, then Gibson's loss of faith in God when his wife dies in a senseless accident is justified, and it's absurd that he regains his faith when later circumstances ""prove"" the necessity of his earlier loss. It's inconceivable to me that God manipulates events to teach people a lesson so they'll be better off later in life. What about the people who suffer and die in the ""lesson""? I cannot believe that a God with unlimited perspective on things who understands every nuance of existence would ever act this way. Besides, there's absolutely no scientific evidence that God could ""cause"" accidents to occur. That is a concept of God that became incredible with the science of the 20th century.

It's better to realize that however God might be, he has no powers of efficient cause in the world. Science refutes that possibility. The only role available to him is as a psychological persuasive force in competition with all of the ""demonic"" forces in the world, and that it is precisely limited perspective that is demonic. The wider your perspective, the better is your chance of understanding what God wants you to do. But the premise of this movie is that God causes tragedy and death for the benefit of those who live on. This means of course that God is the cause of evil in the world. It would be irrational to worship such a God, anymore than it would be rational to love any Great Leader with unlimited power, like Hitler or Stalin. Sure, some people under the unimaginably cruel rule of the Great Leader persuaded themselves that they loved their Great Leader. But it is beneath human dignity to succumb to such temptations.

1471915,2,B00005JL3T,"Walking into `Signs', I had high expectations.  I consider `The Sixth Sense' to be near perfection, and `Unbreakable', while flawed, was truly inspired in both conception and direction.  I really anticipated another memorable night with Mr. Shyamalan.  Instead, what I encountered was a huge disappointment.  `Signs', while visually stunning at times, lacks nearly everything that made his previous efforts so remarkable.

There was almost no tension, and there was no real cohesion.

Aliens have been the topic of many horror films, with varying results.  Some films truly capture the dread that comes with the unknown, while others fail to capitalize on that human curiosity.  For me, `Signs' falls very short of its own promise by delivering a film that moves at a snails pace, setting up a conclusion that serves up mild amounts of paranoia.  Shyamalan also seems to have turned his brain off for this film, for the conclusions he asks the audience to draw from this are simply improbable and kind of, well, stupid.

This is far better than `Lady in the Water', but that isn't say much since that film is beyond abysmal.

`Signs' revolves around a close-knit family who discover crop circles that begin to make a serious impact on their lives.  You have Rev. Graham Hess, who is a widower and is suffering from a lack of faith (or at least a bout with it).  His brother Merrill lives with him on his isolated farm and works hard to keep what's left of his family together.  Together they raise Morgan and Bo, Graham's two children.  As the crop circles begin to pop up all over the world, Graham and Merrill start to contemplate what this all means for them, and for everyone else.

Is there anything they can do to prevent what is bound to happen?

The climactic scene in the cellar is chilling to a degree, but it lacks the visceral punch that one got when watching Shyamalan's previous films.  There was a layered and harrowing atmosphere created in both `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' that is not present in `Signs'.  I know that some (maybe many) will disagree with me, but I just didn't find this film as gripping nor as suspenseful as so many claimed it to be.  I found the way in which Shyamalan connected the dots within his own story to be rather sporadic and disjointed and the eventualities weighed down any of the tension with their ridiculous nature.  I really admired Shyamalan in the beginning, for having an imagination he continually insisted on challenging in order to create something fresh and exciting, but he has continued to go so far out in left field that his ideas become tainted with preposterousness.

It's like he forgot how to make a movie.

The performances in `Signs' are all good.  Not a sour grape in the bunch, to be honest.  I am not almost convinced of Mel Gibson's talent, but he pulls out a very nuanced performance here (something that helps elevate the film in times of serious need).  Phoenix is an actor who I at one time adored but have grown somewhat cold on.  This is a minor effort for him, but it works.  Abigail Breslin (whose character arc is infuriating) and Rory Culkin (possibly the most talented of the Culkin clan) put out good performances here, doing their best to combat the script handed to them.

As a director (at least in his earlier days) Shyamalan shines.  Even here he manages to deliver sequences that are visually captivating, and that style alone leads to sharp edits and sharper chills.  As a screenwriter he has diminished, and his ideas deter us from his directory flare.

This should have been so much better.",1279152000,,3591,4.73268921095008

The people who give this movie one star embarrass themselves.  In fact, perhaps the movie was so real for some people, it scared them into wanting to insult the movie.

1471919,5,B00005JL3T,"I admit I was entirely wrong when I originally outright dismissed this movie when it first came out.  I was apparently holding a grudge at the time because of my *strong* dislike for the Sixth Sense.  Completely different movies, so my initial reaction upon watching Signs was totally unfair, and for that I feel the need to apologize.  I'm sorry!

I guess back then I was expecting Signs to be an all-out alien invading film that involves the mysterious space creatures constantly finding terrifying ways to torture the people on Earth.  Instead, the storyline is much slower paced, allowing more time to build suspense, and allowing more time to slowly unravel what the aliens look like and what their intentions are.  Sorry, I didn't realize this back when the movie first came out.

What's even more mysterious about my dislike for Signs back in the day is that I usually LOVE small town, family-oriented films.  I don't know what I was thinking back then to be honest, I really don't.

It's also entirely possible I just didn't get M. Night Shyamalan's style.  After all, let's be completely honest here- his style was quite revolutionary when it first came out.  I mean, this isn't your ordinary horror film.  Some may love his style, others may not, but the one thing that can't be denied is that his style is certainly *different*.

Anyway, Signs does a great job keeping the suspense constant by way of releasing a very small amount of storyline at a time.  It doesn't give away too much too soon so the movie ultimately becomes predictable.  No, it avoids all THAT typical nonsense.

My favorite part of film is probably when the entire family is in the car, and hear alien screeches and sounds coming from the baby monitor.  Everyone then exits the car, as the sound continues (apparently coming from the nearby cornfield, though to be honest, I was quite confused over what was taking place in Pennsylvania and what was taking place in Mexico City and other places).  Talk about a perfectly executed eerie build-up in horror quality THIS moment is.

The ending is probably the weakest part, and in fact, the only negative I have with the movie.  The best part about Signs is that, for the majority of it, we didn't actually SEE the aliens.  So when the ending came along... I was disappointed.

The way the aliens appear should have been left up to our imaginations so we could have interpreted what they look like by ourselves.  Small complaint, I promise.

Overall, yeah, the suspense is really good.  I totally don't know why I didn't like this film when it was first released.  I love it now.  Mel Gibson nails his role, and the rest of the characters (including the little boy who DOES look like Macaulay Culkin) are right on the money as well.  For the most part, this is horror storytelling done right.",1272412800,,2821,4.6904276985743385
1471920,1,B00005JL3T,"One of the worst attempts at -- what? -- I have ever seen. Mel Gibson doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. Joaquin Phoenix is obviously stoned out of his gourd (and who wouldn't be, given the totally absurd and vapid character he is given to portray?). The children are a combination of McCauley Calkin in ""Home Alone"" and Harry Potter, minus the humor or intelligence. Actually, ""Home Alone"" is probably the film most analogous to this one. Think of Joe Pesci as a dim-witted alien, dressed in a cut-rate rubber halloween costume, without the brains to do much except go bump in the night, and you've got the gist of this atrociously poor offering. How this one ever escaped into theaters is a question for the ages.

1471921,5,B00005JL3T,"Shyamalan's trademark pitch-perfect storytelling in SIGNS is covered elsewhere. This film has a unique blend of science fiction, suspense, shock, drama, and the beautiful struggle of human relationships. The acting is tremendous, from two big stars to two little kids.

Video quality is great. It's mostly a dark film so this isn't a demo BD. There are some soft spots occasionally but it's a good transfer with great detail. Some of the scenes of the alien intruder look a little fake but this was one of the first films to have an entirely CG character. Those scenes are so creative they're enjoyable, regardless.

Audio quality is excellent, though I haven't decided whether the PCM or Dolby tracks sound better, I switched back and forth (my receiver indicated the PCM track was 2.1). The comprehensive sound effects are an unseen character, they tell the story, and coordinate perfectly with the music. This is how theatrical sound should be.

I also liked the extras: some deleted scenes (SD), a decent making-of, two multi-angle scenes, and a clip from Shyamalan's ""first alien movie."" Altogether, this BD is a fine presentation for an excellent film.",1271894400,3,1158,5.052356020942408

1.  Reverend looses faith after wife is tragically killed in a car accident.  Couldn't have been very faithful to begin with, most people of faith that I know personally do not lose their faith because some loved one dies ""before their time"", much less a reverend.  I realize this is largly anecdotal but it still may be accurate.
2.  No one ever seems to have a gun.  Would someone care to explain to me where in middle America there is a corn farmer with no shotgun, ever hear of crows anyone. This actually seems to be a recurrent theme in these movies. There are 80 to 100 million guns owned by Americans, but they never seem be anywhere in the movie when the aliens invade.  Are we actually supposed to belive that when aliens invade the earth that no one ever seems to have a gun handy but the police (who are usually portrayed as way to competent) and the military (who are usually portrayed as way to incompetant).  If a average American actually does have a gun they are usually portrayed as some kind of whack job (Tim Robbins in War Of The Worlds).
3.  Aliens invade to supposedly take us for food but are so allergic to water that it burns them.  Okay this has been talked about endlessly in the 1 star reviews but they are going to eat people that are made up of more than 90% water, can I have a glass of suphuric acid please.
4.  The baby monitor.  This is even worse than Independance Day's signals being deciphered by the cable guy.
5.  The aliens are not armed with anything other than a poison gas squirted from their wrists.  See point #2
6.  Alien is so lame that it cannot break down the pantry door.  Again, see point # 2
7.  Just where is the military?  Lame aliens should have been kicked off earth in less than a day by the military of even the smallest third world country.

It appears that a lot of people went to it with the expectation that it would be a sci-fi movie.

They pick it apart as though it were a sci-fi movie, because that's what it seems to be. And, quite frankly, when viewed with that mindset, it really does fail miserably.

But only if you think Signs is a sci-fi movie. It's not. Signs is actually a fable. Like ""The Three Little Pigs,"" or ""Little Red Riding Hood."" It's meant to be viewed with the same mindset one uses when viewing ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" or most of Miyazaki's movies. You don't bother about plot holes when watching ""Spirited Away,"" and one shouldn't bother about them in this movie either, for the exact same reasons.

It's been a really long time since I've seen Signs, and I don't remember it that well. I do remember that I really, really liked it.

SIGNS: I love M. Night Shyamalan movies for the simple reason that he always leads the viewer on an adventure and you never know which way he will take you.  I've seen Signs about seven times and never get tired of it, so I had to buy the DVD.  It's a mystery; suspenseful; a thriller, and funny in parts, thanks to Joaquin Phoenix who plays Mel Gibson's younger brother.  Mel Gibson is a reverend who has lost his faith due to the death of his wife. When mysterious crop circles show up in his corn field, his disbelief soon turns into fear for his family. I get goose bumps every time I watch this. M. Night Shyamalan makes an appearance as the local vet. Don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say anymore except buy this DVD!

THE VILLAGE: This is another M. Night Shyamalan movie that I've seen several times. A tight knit community lives in fear of what's in the forest just outside of their village. It's so evil that no one will venture into the woods and the villagers post sentries in towers at night to make sure all is safe.  The elders are very secretive about what this evil thing is. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) play a young couple in love.  Bryce's character is blind.  When Joaquin's character is injured, she must save him by venturing into the woods and going to the nearest town for medical supplies.  She alone has the courage to face what's in the forest.

Many reviewers here complained about the ridiculous plot holes and I agree. It's full of holes.

I see a lot of movies and I will walk if it looks lousy. There's 20+ movies to choose from, why waste time on a lousy one? If I hear lame dialog, a trite or cliche script, if I roll my eyes more than twice, I'm outta there. If the writer and director are lousy, they're not going to get any better. An exception to this is when they hire another writer or director after firing the lame one. An example of this is ""The Muppets Take Manhattan,"" where the first half is lousy, but the second half is good and even great in some parts.

I walked on ""Signs"" after about 40 minutes and didn't look back. However, a family member insisted that it was good and all came together in the end, so I went back and watched the entire movie, start to end. Boy was I sorry, I should have stayed away.

The movie is ridiculous on various levels, but besides that, it has nothing worthwhile to offer.

As soon as the aliens came into the story, I was able to accurately predict the entire story: Aliens may or may not be here. As the movie progresses, the evidence of the aliens becomes more pronounced until we begin to see glimpses of them. From there we will go into the climax where we have a showdown with the aliens and win. That's a synopsis of the plot and who, I mean who, is going to say there is anything at all original about that? No one over the age of 13.

The movie plays out just as I predicted. But there's some quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo thrown in there that's really the point of the story. Fine, the only problem is that the mumbo-jumbo is so utterly ridiculous that it's laughable.

Unless I'm missing something (unlikely), the plot is this: God causes Gibson's wife to get horribly injured in an accident where she suffers in agony until Gibson can get there, whereupon she delivers a coded message from God to Gibson, without Gibson realizing it, and then she dies. This accident causes Gibson to lose his faith in God. Meanwhile, God has caused another family member that is a budding baseball star to suffer an injury and his career and life are ruined. Then, God causes the kid to have asthma and an irrational preoccupation with water, resulting in half glasses of water being left all over the house. Then, God causes all these circumstances to work together during an alien invasion of earth such that the coded message, the asthma, the water, and the sports career work together to defeat the aliens in the house and save lives. Gibson sees how God has wrought all of this and regains his faith. If that's it, that's the most utterly ridiculous, blasphemous, lame, contrived, etc story I've ever heard of.

So I'm wondering two things: 1: Is my understanding of the story complete and my laughter is justified, or did I miss something?

The movie is ridiculous on various levels, but besides that, it has nothing worthwhile to offer.

As soon as the aliens came into the story, I was able to accurately predict the entire story: Aliens may or may not be here. As the movie progresses, the evidence of the aliens becomes more pronounced until we begin to see glimpses of them. From there we will go into the climax where we have a showdown with the aliens and win. That's a synopsis of the plot and who, I mean who, is going to say there is anything at all original about that? No one over the age of 13.

The movie plays out just as I predicted. But there's some quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo thrown in there that's really the point of the story. Fine, the only problem is that the mumbo-jumbo is so utterly ridiculous that it's laughable.

Unless I'm missing something (unlikely), the plot is this: God causes Gibson's wife to get horribly injured in an accident where she suffers in agony until Gibson can get there, whereupon she delivers a coded message from God to Gibson, without Gibson realizing it, and then she dies. This accident causes Gibson to lose his faith in God. Meanwhile, God has caused another family member that is a budding baseball star to suffer an injury and his career and life are ruined. Then, God causes the kid to have asthma and an irrational preoccupation with water, resulting in half glasses of water being left all over the house. Then, God causes all these circumstances to work together during an alien invasion of earth such that the coded message, the asthma, the water, and the sports career work together to defeat the aliens in the house and save lives. Gibson sees how God has wrought all of this and regains his faith. If that's it, that's the most utterly ridiculous, blasphemous, lame, contrived, etc story I've ever heard of.

So I'm wondering two things: 1: Is my understanding of the story complete and my laughter is justified, or did I miss something? And 2: How on earth did the guy that wrote the brilliant ""The 6th Sense"" write this load of tripe? It would seem that his contract with the movie studio includes a ""right of subcontract"" and he subcontracted his swimming pool cleaning guy to write this.",1240790400,3,3117,4.485008818342152

1472072,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is one of those singularly beautiful films that have come so rarely in history. It transcends genres, reaches across demographics, and touches the hearts of millions.
  In this film by M. Night Shyamalan, we find a farming family wounded by a recent loss. The children have lost their mother, and thus their father has lost his wife. In the midst of this traumatic event, the father has left his faith, seeing life governed only by chance.
  One morning, his son and daughter find a large, perfect circle in their field, with the cornstalks laid down and spiraling outward, but not broken. At first, the father believes it to be a hoax. But as hundreds of more 'crop circles' appear around the globe, and mysterious lights shine in the night sky, it becomes clear that these events reveal that mankind is not alone in the universe ----nor on the earth.
  During this film, we watch as the family passes from wonder, to anxiety, to dread, and finally fear. We feel their emotions, both by the actors' compelling performances, and by Shyamalan's beautiful, almost poetic script. The cinematography is eerie and superb, and James Newton Howard's score is captivating.  The storyline is simple yet logical, with the right doses of humor, heartache, horror, and hope. From the family's decision to wear tinfoil hats to keep the aliens from reading their minds (a handy piece of advice obtained from a book by `Dr. Bimboo'), to their sightings of creatures in the fields, this movie is one you will not soon forget. It is an uplifting tale, were a family finds they are not alone in life. There is Someone who watches over us,  who cares for us, and will not abandon us.

1472164,2,B00005JL3T,"(Review contains spoilers)

Signs is a movie that starts out kind of slow, then gets more suspenseful as time goes on, looks promising for a little while, and then falls completely flat.

I'm going to mention but mostly ignore the obvious flaws in the plot, like the fact that the aliens to whom water is poisonous choose to come to a planet permeated with it. Those flaws are forgivable. I can perform some logical gymnastics and say that maybe it's only liquid water that's harmful. I'm not saying this makes a lot of sense, but I can at least put that aside.

What can't be put aside is the pathetic ending. It turns out that a bunch of bad stuff that happened in the past turned out to be God's way of preparing this family to live through the alien invasion, including the wife's death in an accident. Her final words, ""swing away"", which the priest had originally thought were just random thoughts from a no-longer-coherent mind, turn out to be a prophetic message telling the brother to take the bat off the wall and try to beat the alien to death with it.

Seriously? God needed to kill this woman in this horrible way so that she could deliver a message from beyond that maybe, possibly, it just might be a good idea to use the weapons you have lying around the house to defend yourself from a hostile intruder? No, really? These guys actually needed to have this carefully orchestrated set of circumstances to get it into their heads that maybe picking up the baseball bat and hitting the alien with it would be a good idea?

The movie desperately wanted to have a message of ""Everything happens for a reason, even the bad stuff, so keep the faith."" Just about everyone in the movie at some point says, ""I don't know. It was almost like I was meant to [do whatever bad thing I did]."" But things like the ""swing away"" prophecy just didn't allow that message to be taken seriously. And, all in all, this movie was a pretty big disappointment.",1228608000,5,1950,4.48169014084507

But, for now, we're focusing on SIGNS, a pretty terrific psychological thriller.

If you haven't seen this movie before, you're in for something different, and I mean that in a good way. SIGNS, dual meaning noted, is one of those films where the less you know about it, going in, the better the viewing experience. The premise, in bare bones, centers on a grieving family living in a desolate Pennsylvanian farmhouse and the strange things which begin to happen to them. Okay, here's a minor spoiler: It begins with the family patriarch nosing around in the cornfields and chancing upon inexplicable crop circles.

Fear works best when cultivated in the mind. Hitchcock knew this, and Shyamalan, eagerly borrowing a page from the Master of Suspense, manipulates the viewer's imagination and invites the brain to wander into all those dark scary places. In SIGNS, the horror is sparing in its physical manifestations. The scenes unveil in restrained fashion. Shyamalan allows the tension to build, utilizing an unsettling score, an unexpected noise here, a fleeting movement there. Above all, Shyamalan makes use of his very, very good actors to lay down a groundwork of uneasiness. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and the kids are very good, their characters coming off as uncomfortable in their skins and just a bit disturbing. In probing the psychological scars of this troubled family, Shyamalan also paves the way for their salvation. Made captive to the brooding atmosphere, I jumped at every turn and kept waiting, just waiting, for that nasty somehing to come tap-tap-tap on the bedroom window. So effective is the film in generating that eerie mood that when the bogeyman finally does appear in all its glory, I actually felt a pang of letdown. To quote Peggy Lee: ""Is that all there is?"" But the build up was so good!

Not to say that there aren't several genuine jump-in-your-seat moments. Wait for the pantry sequence and wait for that video tape from Brazil. They're good for ambushing that peace of mind.

I dig the offbeat vibe. I won't mention the context, but there's a baby monitor, tin foil, and half-empty glasses of water which all play key roles to the plot. SIGNS also breaks into metaphysical ground and meditates on the power of belief and faith and the interconnectivity of things. Something in my brain clicked, satisfyingly, when, near the end, the ex-reverend instructs the ex-baseball player to ""Swing away, Merrill."" Aha, I thought. That's what that was all about!

In watching SIGNS, in experiencing this quiet creeping up of terror, you could see why the movie world was lauding Shyamalan so effusively. After thrilling to this one years ago, I couldn't wait to see what Shyamalan had next in store. But we won't talk about THE VILLAGE, okay?",1225065600,,3646,5.963671128107075
1472167,4,B00005JL3T,"`Signs' is a movie that is so multi-faceted that it is near impossible to sum it up in a single review. The movie is terrifying, hilarious, inspirational, moving, thrilling, and very rewarding. Director M. Night Shymalan (`The Sixth Sense') goes against the grain of modern horror movies and emphasizes character over action and suspense over violence. The result is a chilling and effective sci-fi thriller that may just be the finest movie of the year.  Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) doesn't like to be called `father' anymore. His stint as a reverend ended six months earlier after a personal tragedy caused him to lose his faith. He now lives on a small farm in Pennsylvania with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix, in the movie's best performance) and his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (the adorable Abigail Breslin.) He enjoys a calm life, until the crop circles show up.  The huge patterns carved into Graham's crops seem even odder when thousands of others turn up all over the world over night. Even more startling are the strange lights that appear in the night sky over Mexico City. The faith of Graham and everyone involved is tested as the world and their lives change around them.  The director (who lives up to all the `next Spielberg' hype that surrounds him) uses many techniques to evoke fear in his audience. What works the most is the personal level he establishes. Whereas most alien invasion flicks use high-tech weaponry and government forces to evoke extra-terrestrial thrills, `Signs' shows what might happen to ordinary people, should aliens invade. The result is both realistic and affecting.  `People break down into two groups,' Graham claims. `those who see signs and miracles, and those who believe we just get lucky. What you have to ask yourself is which kind of person are you. And is it possible that there are no coincidences?' Tough choice. And every person who sees this movie will ponder that question because the movie forces them to. And, for once, they will have time to think. As previously stated, this movie emphasizes character over action. In fact, halfway through the movie there is a 5-minute long scene that consists merely of the two main characters having a discussion. There is no background music, no diverting visuals - just two people talking. It is one of the most well written and acted scenes of the year.  Don't get me wrong though. No matter how philosophical the movie may be, it has more than it's share of thrills. Taking a cue from Hitchcock himself, Shymalan truly ""plays the audience like a drum."" I have seen audience members scream, cry, and all but wet themselves in fear during this movie.",1222819200,2,2668,4.86784140969163
1472168,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is by far the most likeable, and worthwhile alien film ever made. It had more of a plot than any other movie with Aliens in it has. It sure dominates ""It came from the sky"", and beats ""The day the earth stood still"", but I have to admit, both of those were pretty good for their times. This one sort of left the aliens in the shadows until it really needed to bring them out, and reveal their true nature. Then again, that's the purpose behind M. Night Shyamalan's genius.

Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is living a pretty strange life after his wife was killed in a mysterious car accident, but it is now the present time, 6 months later. His children (Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) are under depression. His little girl, Bo, only drinking half a glass of water then saying it's contaminated. His brother of very few words (Joaquin Phoenix) tries to help by moving in with him, but maybe it's only making things worse.

The matter changes when a mysterious crop circle appears in the family corn fields. Normally you'd shake this off, but one day later, over 50 crop circles appear all over India. It seems that someone is trying to prove a point by playing this perfectly executed prank, but the problem doesn't stop there. It seems as though people are making sightings of strange creatures just barely after the events of the crop circles, and it doesn't look like they want to leave.

The acting in this one was great. The kid actors did a very good job, especially Abigail Breslin who played little Bo Hess. She's so precious. There was something about Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix that made them show their acting talents, even though it didn't seem like they were doing much, but it was great acting on everyone's part, maybe Rory Culkin just a little bit less, but he did good also. Probably runs in the famous Culkin family.

The DVD was certainly entertaining escpecially with the deleted scenes. I always like to see DVD's with special features like that. Even M. Night Shyamalans first scary movie that he ever made when he was a kid. Seriously, how many people can say they started making movies as a kid? Not many, and it's surprising to see these, and they're actually pretty funny.

What I liked about the movie the best were the aliens. You never even see them until the ending. You don't even need to see them just to know they're there, that what was what kept me watching it till the end. It truly did scare to think they might be hiding in the darkness someday.

1472264,5,B00005JL3T,"When reviewing Blu-Ray movies, I almost feel like two reviews are needed.  One review for the Blu-Ray and quality of the audio/video transfer, and another review for the movie itself.  Right now, I am focusing more on the Blu-Ray audio/video quality with some mention about the movie.  Mainly because when I am shopping for Blu-Rays, I already have a pretty good opinion in mind about the movie itself.  I am more interested in the quality of the audio/video transfer before I fork out the increased dollars to purchase a Blu-Ray over a standard def DVD.

So, here it goes.  I actually was quite impressed with the audio and video quality of this Blu-Ray.  That alone made it a joy to watch.  Throw in that Signs is a pretty good suspenseful movie anyways, and the result is a 5 star rating for this Blu-Ray.

This Blu-Ray transfer appeared to be very clean.  The picture did not appear to have any distortions nor artifacts that I could detect.  As an earlier reviewer accurately described, this movie does not leap off the screen with bright colors.  The impressive nature of this Blu-Ray is in it's depiction of it's darker colors and blacks.  My guess is that is by design as it matches the mood of the movie.  The sharp and clean rendering of these dark colors was downright impressive in my opinion.

The audio was crisp.  To me, the audio further enhanced viewing of this film.  The crisp sounds coming through in the surround system added to the suspense and aided in some of those startle moments.  All in all, I think that the audio added to the movie.

As I mentioned above, my assumption is that most who are looking for Blu-Rays in the near future are likely video and audiophiles who already have an idea about the movies that they are interested in purchasing.  As such, I really won't provide much of a movie review.  I will simply state that this is a suspenseful movie with good acting.  Some ""darker"" themes are explored that add at least a little depth to this movie.  Would I say that this movie is perfect?  No, not at all.  I would say that this is at least a good movie that is entertaining and suspenseful.  The good movie combined with the excellent quality of the Blu-Ray result in my rating this Blu-Ray movie 5 stars.  To say it another way, I'd give the movie itself a B.  I would then rate the audio/video quality of this Blu-Ray an A.  I consider this Blu-Ray an excellent edition to my collection.",1218067200,5,2430,4.534562211981567

1) This movie is so politically correct.  Why does this farmer or anyone else not have a friggin' gun?  It reminds me of Scott Evil, character in Austin Powers movies,--- take a gun and just shoot him!  Get it over with!

This was one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. It is clear that Mr. Shyamalan had an over abundance of ideas that he wanted to say (many of which were quite interesting) when he made this film. However, he did not come close to putting them together in the cohesive unit that it needed to be in. ""It's not working"" was what I kept thinking. It came across as fragmented, nonsensical, comedic and unbelievable. If you add on top of this very poor direction and acting (by normally very good actors) with almost laughable and wooden dialogue (ala Star Wars Episode 1), the result is ""Signs"". I basically felt like I was watching a really well funded student film with Mel Gibson playing the lead role.

Sixth Sense, which I enjoyed.
Unfortunately, Signs didn't hold the same interest for me. I found it tiresome and boring.
I continued to watch it in the hopes that something might happen, but it just kept on with its tedious wandering. It seemed to lack direction and focus.
With the exception of Unbreakable, I think most of M. Night's movies (after Sixth Sense) have been a painful let-down.
I can't recommend this movie and am not sure I look forward to anymore of
M. Night's future movies.

1472352,4,B00005JL3T,"Like Orson Wells' radio broadcast of ""The War of Worlds"", Signs is incredibly scary, with a tense buildup and suspense worthy of someone with ADD.  It's a great sci-fi story, with one MASSIVE flaw.  If the goal is a simple, mindless scare, then Signs does a fair job.

A former precher and his mix-match family of a brother and two children live in a small farming town.  They live the typical eventless life that leads a young man to thinking about joining the military and a child to thinking about becoming a local fireman.  One day, however, a crop circle appears in their corn, and everything changes.

The character development of Signs is absolutely superb.  Graham's (Gibson) loss of faith shows a true weakness, a character flaw seen in all heroes.  His brother Merrill (Phoenix) is the a former baseball star known for his home run power, but he's a typical late-twenty something, down on his luck and looking for a new life.  This and the small town existence is making him think about joining the military.  The other children, Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin) are intricately tied into the storyline and well-acted.  The entire movie, from beginning to end, gives the viewer great connections and a nice leadup; each character's uniqueness eventually flows together into the storyline.

To make a long story short, the crop circles are a result of aliens, and the aliens are on earth to kill, maim, and pillage.  They are an intensely superior lifeform, more intelligent and advanced in nearly every way. HOWEVER, they are evidently, highly allergic to water.  In fact, with just a few drops the acidic nature of water can kill them.  And they decided to attack Earth, a planet comprised of 75% water?  Really?!  Advanced enough to master space travel, yet they and chose Earth?  Brilliant.

If you like alien movies, and well made suspense movies, and you can ignore the one glaring flaw to this movie's premise, it's a great movie.  The twist ending is well thought out and enjoyable.  It's very easy to relate to the characters and get sucked into the story.",1206144000,2,2074,4.80225988700565
1472353,4,B00005JL3T,"About once a year, I get an itching to pull out a copy of Signs and watch the movie, although I always approach such temptations with more than a little reservation.  The first time I saw the film in the theater, I was not overawed by the production, although it seemed to me to be an acceptable thriller with a bit of a trite ""destiny"" theme with a very strong cast of main characters.  Because of this first lukewarm appreciation which I had for the film, I always have reservation as I pull my copy of Signs off the shelf, afraid that the itching will ultimately end in my dislike of the movie.  However, after the third or fourth reviewing - and quite a deal of growing up - I can unequivocally say that Signs is a fantastic movie and believe that I now have the experiential wherewithal  to elaborate a bit on why this is my overall impression of the film.

It is perhaps in its weakest point that Signs is most strongly supported for its perpetual enjoyment.  That weakness lies in the fact that, on the whole, the film is very ""cool"" - in the media sense of leaving much to the viewer's interpretation.  At first glance, this coolness can appear to be nothing other than laziness on the part of the director and writers of the film.  More is accomplished by wisps, shades, and intrigue than by direct dialogue.  This open environment is handled a bit clumsily at times, explaining why the film can come off as being nothing more than a trite sci-fi thriller with a twist and a moral.  However, a second (and third) viewing of Signs proffers to return to a thriller but instead finds itself to be as enriching of an experience as the first viewing, if not more enriching.  The second time around, one realizes that the haziness of details and looseness of plot is the gem at the heart of this film.  Upon repeat viewing, I found myself more captivated by the story, perhaps because I was more willing to embrace the film on something of a more existential level.

This overall allowance for an existential appropriation is not found in lofty dialogue or enigmatic phrases.  Instead, the film poses the short (albeit complex) question, ""Is there something greater than chance tied into the fabric of causality in space and time?""  The openness of the film prevents the viewer from appropriating a singular ""Signs-watching experience"" and instead offers a wider vista for the consideration of these issues.  Each time that a viewer returns to this little diadem, (s)he is offered a chance, once again, to consider this question anew with a new set of life experiences.

Additionally, this openness (and somewhat lack of detail) has the added effect of strengthening the thrill-based portion of the film.  Since the film doesn't really work in single shocking scenes but by means of high tension, multiple viewings are not destroyed by the dismissal of the action as merely a trite repetition of previous experiences.  The viewer is returned to a state of anticipation and not one of full resolution, thereby allowing for the continuation of suspense after numerous viewings.

On the whole, I highly suggest the movie.  The more cynical viewers in the world may scoff at its simple question and utilization of Science Fiction as a genre.  However, those who are willing to at least engage in the conversation of the film will find themselves generously rewarded.  As seasons pass and experiences change, we can all return to the question of ""Is life more than chance?""  Because this is perennial to all humanity and thanks to the relative ""coolness"" of the film, Signs is a movie worth viewing many times throughout the years.",1204329600,3,3629,4.723809523809524
1472354,5,B00005JL3T,"Like all of Shyamalan's work, don't let the scary subject matter fool you - this is a wonderful film is only a 'horror' movie on one level. Gibson plays a pastor who has lost his faith after a tragedy, living with his two small children and brother (Phoenix), a failed baseball player. They live in a big old farmhouse in the midwest, and before long, peculiar things start happening. Crop patterns appear. They hear things running around outside at night. And then....
On another level, the movie's about people whose lives have fallen apart from loss. Coming face to face with their fears because of the 'scary events,' they reconnect with themselves and each other, and wake up from the unhappy slumber they've been in. Gibson and Phoenix portray their characters beautifully, and then children are excellent, too. Is it a scary movie? You bet - scary and gripping.

1472358,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs, is a masterpiece, an image of what horror always should have been.

Probably the best thing about Signs is that it scares you to death, while at the same time it shows you very little of what you're scared of, a sillhouette, an arm, a foot disappearing into the corn feild.

Many people accuse M. Night Shyamalan's movies of having dead-pan characters, I don't think this is true. I think Night is trying to be realistic, in other movies people are being over the top in expressing who they are, but that is not true in reality, in real life people won't be as interesting as they are in the movies. Shyamalan's work captures this perfectly, through the film you get to care for the people who are in it, you relate to them because they are very human.

Yes, this is an alien film, no it is not derivitive of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"". M. Night can take a topic that's now a cliche (like aliens coming to earth) and make it original, in this movie the aliens are sneaky and quite, they don't come down and blow things up War of the Worlds style.

9/10 impressive, super cool, must see.",1196380800,2,1089,4.376237623762377
1472359,5,B00005JL3T,"It is an excellent example of that scary movie-psychological thriller genre that is epitomized by  Alfred Hitchcock. Proving that our imaginations are far more provocation and tumultous when allowed to be-when guided by, hints of images or suggestions of evil rather than being confronted with gruesome in your face reality like you see in slasher films. It's a far more scary movie than anything with dripping blood and constant screaming, mean people in masks, or even zombies in the mall. It is the suggestion, the hint of evil that gets you thinking, that worries you about what is around the next corner, what exactly is that rustling in the cornstalks?

The movie is on a number of interesting levels. The big one for me is the collision of faith with the problem of evil, in this case revolving around the issue of signs, the meaning and purpose of our existence versus randomness-chance-meaninglessness-insignificance. The question is starkly put, the character played by Mel Gibson is a preacher whose wife dies violently pinned between a truck and a tree trunk nearly cut in half, dying as she calmly talks for a last moment with her husband, remembering each family member with a specific phrase. With her death he abandons his faith and his calling, leaving just a shadow of a cross hanging over the bed, where past sunlight bleached the wall around it. Gone now to is his belief in a good God who cares about His creatures and watches over each one, showing His care and concern with signs and miracles.

What is the meaning of events? Especially ones so life changing as his wife's accidental death? What is the meaning and significance of the two kids problems: the young daughter is an compulsive-obsessive about drinking water, leaving partially filled glasses all over the house. The pre-teen son is a serious asthmatic, whose life depends on an inhaler and an occasional shot, any excitement could cause him to breath his last breathe as his airways close off his breathing. These things as well as the baseball bat are cleverly tied into the story line of an alien invasion, seen through the eyes of these people in their home in the middle of a cornfield with massive meaningful (to the aliens) crop circles.

The big questions is about events, how to interpret them as signs and meaningful events, rather than just chance happenstance. To see life as meaningful in the midst of what appears to be large quantities of noise and the random movement of lifeless molecules, how to see signs-events with meaning against the changing background of our often chaotic world.......

The movie offers an answer, one that Mel Gibson takes to heart, regaining both his faith and his clerical collar, that signs are there, they are what you make of them that matters. The son's asthma saves him from the poison gas of the alien, the daughter's water topples off the table burning and killing the alien, ""Swing away""-his wife's last words are the spark for the brother to clobber the alien with the bat he set a baseball record with. All things are connected, everything is meaningful and significant, even the little most insignificant (a bit like the bacteria that killed the aliens in ""War of the Worlds"") have there place, if only we have eyes to see and ears to hear-the meaning of the events.

The movie is ambiguous concerning the next big question, is the meaningfulness there because we see it or is it there because of the way the universe is designed and how history is channelled and controlled. In the first case, the answer is that of faith in faith itself, the power of positive thinking, the prosperity gospel that rain follows the plow, that positive thoughts attract good people and that wealth, power and all good things come to those that believe in their hearts that they deserve these things given to them by a grateful universe that loves and rewards their positive outlook.

It is the sign or the meaningfulness that human beings attach to it that is the locus, the central theme? Are the crop circles meaningful because they are created by the aliens as landing zone markers, or are they meaningful as they mark the graves and failed conquest due to the presence of saving water on the planet? What is the relationship of the sign to the meaning that people attach to it? is it really there or are we just projecting our natural hopefulness onto it? Is it real or just all in our heads? does it matter?

good questions, scary movie, worthwhile watching.",1194739200,12,4486,4.779354838709677
1472360,5,B00005JL3T,"ATMOSPHERE.

This is what is lacking in so many so-called thrillers today and what made older films so successful.  Even B cult films such as the 1977 original ""The Hills Have Eyes"", were saved by the precious quality of atmosphere.  If a film can create a chilling atmoshpere, along with competant acting, then it has already won more than half the battle.  M. Night Shayamalan's ""Signs"" is a SUPERB example of how to create an incredibly razor's edge atmosphere and the filmaker should be applauded immensely for this.  Too many ""thrillers"" today rely on sex and gore which really cheapen the plot and leave the viewer really not all that ""scared"", but rather just plain grossed out.

""Signs"", I feel, is probably one of the most horribly underrated films of all time, and this is REALLY a shame.  So many reviewers seemed to have completely overlooked the awesome atmosphere of this film, especially with the omninous build-up of the alien invasion and the eerie music played in the background of the film.

They've also described the scene where one of these highly intelligent creatures is trapped in a pantry: the door was not locked, but was secured by nailing boards across the door frame after the alien was inside.  I haven't read all 1199 reviews, but of those I've read nobody has mentioned that the door opened into the pantry (if my memory serves me well).  Therefore, the only thing keeping the alien in the pantry was that he couldn't figure out how a doorknob worked.

The DVD also has a nice story board to scene feature for certain parts of the movie. It's kinda neat to see how the finished product stacked up against the story boards.

1472434,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs has much more to offer than Orson Welles' ""War of the Worlds."" In this reality, the world is populated with numerous signs seemingly hidden in plain sight.

Director M. Night Shyamalan divides people into two camps: The type who believes in miracles, sees signs; and those who think we just get lucky.

Shyamalan's carefully crafted universe has creatures that must resort to warring with other planets to survive... and there is us. Shyamalan's war pits technologically superior creatures against an unsuspecting world, and a shattered world occupied by a clergyman who questions his faith following the death of his wife. Shyamalan goes further than the Sixth Sense, the bone-chilling tale of a young boy (""I see dead people"") haunted by ghosts who appear regularly in his life to enlist his help. In Signs, Shyamalan declares not only can we help the dead, the dead also help us.

Another way of putting it: There are no coincidences. From the son's asthma and the daughter's dreams to the brother's baseball prowess and the tragic instance in which a veterinarian's momentary lapse at the wheel claims a life. The plot is a masterpiece in misdirection. Signs opens to an aerial view of crop circles. More signs of the impending invasion appear as the story moves forward. But these are not the signs that we should be looking at. In the last reel, the dying wife who has but a moment to tell seems to be rambling. But it turns out, she was staring into the future, not her husband's eyes.

This movie says we are much more than we seem.

Mel Gibson's character, the grieving Rev. Graham Hess finds himself suddenly struggling to make sense of the many odd happenings at his farm. He already has isolated himself following his wife's death. Of course, his guard is up. But he finds himself awkwardly grasping to cling to his understanding of the new reality. He can dismiss the crop circles in his fields as mischief by pranksters. But, he soon can't deny the mounting evidence and nocturnal visits from unseen and unseeable intruders. Edgy, provocative and well-paced, Signs is a multilayered and intricately woven piece to try and digest in an afternoon at the theater.

I was first struck by Shyamalan's study of how his characters cope with the increasingly apparent threat. The no-nonsense son Morgan immediately seeks out a book and a curious and chilling element to this story, a baby monitor. The brother Merrill who has taken a room over the garage to help the family turns to the TV. The youngest, the girl who must be about kindergarten age, believes she is dreaming. It is the father, Graham, who is not coping well living in denial. But who can blame him?

""There is no one out there to help us. We're all alone,"" our resigned and frockless clergyman declares.

The final scenes are well-constructed to induce fear. Shyamalan masterfully pulls all the pieces together at the end. If you were impressed by Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, you will enjoy this offering... again and again.",1182038400,2,3004,4.830739299610895

Normally, Science-Fiction films either bore me greatly, or scare me out of my wits, but this story is quite different.  Not only is this a well-made, tense and exciting story of an attempted alien invasion of Earth, but it is also a very touching and actually inspirational story.  Mel Gibson plays a former minister who totally lost his faith as the result of his wife's tragic death, but eventually finds it once again as a result of an exciting encounter with aliens.  Beginning with the appearance of ""crop circles"" in his corn field, then in other locales around the world, followed soon by other strange ""signs,"" Gibson finds himself trapped by the aliens in his home, with his two small children and his younger brother, played well by Joaquin Phoenix.

Then comes the humor. Rarely has so much ironic, self-deprecating humor been laid down so consistently in the Scary Movie genre.

This is classic Mel the Hilarious, before the establishment painted him Conflicted and Conflictive for daring to portray the violent demise of Jesus and for his gigantic miscalculation while talking to a trooper while quite drunk.

'It was very dark', he and his somewhat perturbed brother played by Joaquin Phoenix, perturbed that is until he achieves his redemption at the end of a baseball bat whose other end was the undoing of an alien. It's hard to describe an alien that makes its appearance by scampering on the roof when it's so inconveniently dark.

Yes, there are aliens in this movie. They are even green and humanoid.

We get to them after the Mel character's tragic loss of a good priest's wife, his near loss of his two children to the hatred that comes when a good father lets the unthinkable happen to Mommy, and the loss of things that Gibson's enormously capable face allows us only to guess at.

'It's not ""Father"" any more', he insists, in abbreviation of all that has been lost but feels like it's been renounced. It hasn't been renounced, only placed on pause while Gibson deals with the kids, his brother, the aliens, and then the recovery of his faith after angry honesty has run its course.

This is the perfect Sunday afternoon movie, best capped off by a nap and then a 'snacky plate', as Sunday evening hints at a bona fide meal are known in our family.

As we learn more and more about the family's background we start to understand why they seem to be so stressed out and tense around each other.  There is some humor, to keep the movie from getting too dark, but I failed to care about what was happening or about the characters themselves.

  Don't get me wrong - the cast did a great job.  But the problem is I am thrown into the story right when the weird things start happening and well after the characters have started to fall apart as a family.  I don't see the good times, I don't see them as a loving family, so I don't really feel the pain of what is happening till near the end when the flashbacks explain what has been going on right under my nose.

When Sixth Sense came out, he was tipped as the next big thing, but I'm sorry to say, it's no longer there. In my mind, he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of Sixth Sense.

Signs just fails miserably. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was terrible. It reminded me very much of Blair Witch Project, as in what little action there was happens off screen, and the torches as well. It's also definitely not Mel Gibson's best film. Even the actors appear to struggle with the dialogue-heavy script, and not really much happens. Apart from one brief glimpse of an alien. Oooh. Fascinating.

The problem I think that Signs has, is that it's already following many other, far superior, alien movies. Aliens attacking the earth has been done, and lots more memorable than this. There's also the overly religious theme, which the film probably would have done better either toning down, or scrapping altogether. It was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film. The scenes between Gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy.

The finale doesn't really make the film better. The discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious! Why come to earth, the surface of is mostly covered in water, and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour?! And then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology - and then can't break into a wooden house?! Are you kidding me? But the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs, who sensed something was not right (time to get myself a dog), but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect the aliens entering our atmosphere - but a BABY MONITOR can?!

A film to stay well away from. Thankfully, I didn't spend my hard earned (ha!) money on it, but borrowed it from a friend. I shall approach M. Night Shyamalan's films with trepidation from now.

But here, he shines, telling a modern day story of not-so-little green men coming to earth, and not in a friendly way. He very easily could have failed here, and this could have turned into a cheesy, b-movie, But he makes you believe. Hopefully he will do that again one day.",1161388800,3,624,4.724770642201835

Signs is the story of hope lost, faith put aside because of intense pain and grief, and how one man's relationship with God affects the lives of those around him.

After, experiencing all of the horrifying events when the creatures come to their house, he discovers that things aren't just coincidences, but miracles and that God has a deeper purpose to everything that happens.

1472584,3,B00005JL3T,"We watched this movie Saturday night. While the pace is much like watching grass, or corn, grow, you eventually get sucked into the whole, silly plot which is about aliens landing in a corn field in Kansas and, instead of taking over the state capitol, or a 7-11, they concentrate all their energy on taking over a farm house where 4 people live.

I have some questions!

Why is it that aliens, who have the technology that allows them to travel 100's of thousand's of light years, can't open a door?

Maybe the aliens aren't from ""out there."" Maybe they are by products of genetically altered corn. Maybe water makes them swell up and pop.

And, why is corn a symbol of evil, or creepiness? I realize that it is a recyclable food, but evil? I just don't get it.

Also, what does Mel Gibson do for a living now that he is unfathered; what does his brother do besides smoke and watch television in a closet? Why don't the kids go to school? Why is no one bothered when the boy murders his dog with a serving fork? What happened to the meat on the barbecue? Where's PETA in all this?

Why are there 1252 half empty water glasses all over the farm house. I realize the daughter has a problem with water (hmm, maybe she's part alien), but doesn't any one ever clean a glass? Don't they ever run out of water glasses? Do you have 1252 water glasses in your house?

Why does the younger brother hit the water glasses with his baseball bat? Wouldn't it have been easier, and more accurate, just to throw water on the alien? How can you break a bat on a water glass?

How come the alien can't get through the wood slats nailed to the windows, but can carve strange patterns in the same wood. It seems to me that he (it?) would just make one of those patterns bigger, and he's (it's) in.

Why does Mel Gibson, who is the father who was a Father, lose his faith when his wife is killed, but get it back when an alien is watered to death in his house?

Why didn't the aliens bring raincoats, and umbrellas?

Why does the boy who has asthma and sucks on his inhaler every 30 seconds throughout the entire movie not have the inhaler when he is in the basement?

Why is the boy dead and then not dead? Is it a miracle, or is it Hollywood?

Why was this movie made?

Did anyone actually read this script before the movie was made?

Why did we watch it?

Will all these questions be answered in the Director's Cut? Or, will it only get sillier?",1154044800,10,2428,4.257080610021786
1472585,1,B00005JL3T,"Must we endure this trad and unenlightening pabulum de jure, to no significant contrasting media interpretation?  Of all things, when our national conscience and sensitivities have already been so violated by that republican Corn Holography!  The Victoria's Secret Service displayed its usual partisan deference to our freely elected chief.  Corporate America and Hollywood practically gave Monica (Mada Hare) Lewinski a medal for her service to her country--the short thinkin'-money hungry crowd enjoys prestige and indecencies without question in rouge.  I expected more from the Indian director, a refreshing departure from our Western corruptions and monolithic thought structures, not that I am suggesting or insinuating a complicity in any way shape or form with the infamous American sex scandal.  I guess everyone has to adapt, tow the cinematic line, and provide the prescriptions for imbecility and infantile simplicity turned into an unwritten standard for film mass distribution--at least we're looking in the same building for adjoining offices, Dumb and Dumber.

We must first appreciate the effort applied in the film, to distort the geographic regions of the crop circles phenomenon--transporting them to the inauthentic locations of America and India.  The South of England is exempt, nothing wrong there.  And the Americans can figure it out with their standard lurching reliefs and implements for barbarous survival, successful in thwarting an advanced alien species capable of traversing the stars--a Flintstonian retaliation on the antigravity civilization with a Louiseville Slugger diplomacy.  The movie sets antipodal conditions for theological belief structures and the hypothesis of extraterrestrials, as much as any pre-Copernican obstinance, a slack-jawed escapism with a foul play on an automobile accident for afterlife relief.  Talk about ambulance chasing...Shyamalan has chased them with this movie.

Impoverishment of movie writing is no doubt linked to the double undercutting of resources available for any given film.  Overcompensation of iconic sensations, stars, are simply taken as a necessary budget cut because the public is apparently incapable of recognizing a movie otherwise, and secondarily, it panders to a Patrician Caste of performers whose confidence payoffs ensure the film will have a prominent market exposure in a monopolized industry--with its pets, and all that smell and mess.  Maintaining the public image of their regency is the first and foremost image to be captured by any film, it sends the public a message that Business as Usual INC. is at the helm, and that the project has its official nod.  Perhaps like icon Martha Stewart, we will one day delight beside the bargain discount clearnaces at K-Mart, signaling a turn in the tide of image manufacture, and pseudo sophistications (like Martha's) affected on the public through the making of idols and trademarked people who are the Icarus.  The effect is self reinforcing, we pay for the inflation of content, (its lack of value), in order to be mesmerized by the unintelligent lure of a larger than life personality.  The dreams of avarice replace the work of dreams.  Art suffers, personas wax more and more phony, pretty soon its all disgustingly preschool.

If we continue to sit on our children's intellect, or our own, to dire anoxic strains of Hollywood, tv, and the news media, we will do the alien's work for them, and devolve to meek and subsentient chattel they can prey on...or at least the luxury lizards of premium compensations, who delude us, can prey on us.  The public no longer buys the premise that it is lucrative to insult our intelligence out of a nostalgia for the medium's now trademark mediocrity.  We know it is meant to condition ignorance through ""emotionally potent oversimplifications"" (""Keeping the Rabble In Line"", Noam Chomsky quoting Reinhold Niebur), understood as a genuine endorsement and not a title of dissent.  It is to condition a deferment to institutional ineptness, corruption, official ignorance, and a policy of incommunicado between the people and the stooges like a recorded phone message.  The film industry gluts itself on the natural opportunities for scavengers, in this ecology of fend for yourself duplicity.  The planet is a quarantine of scurrilous demise, a HAZMAP, a do not go zone-[primitive life form in terminal sequence--wait till the smoke clears and the bull$#!+ subsides].  Maybe that's what the crop circles really say.

It is up to us you know.  And whatever they are, they are mere words of a sort.  They will not solve our problems for us, they would spare us, it would be easier so to die, no one to blame but ourselves in our demise.  Why lend a hopeless cause such useless resolution as peace and community?  We are invaded enough as is to the nth degree of murderous daylight robbery from all quarters for all necessities.  Who do these film industry douche-bags think they are with their Puppet show?  You can't call ENRON green aliens from space, no matter how hard you try, nor the ignored memos that 9-11 was about to happen...nor the Arabic translation the FBI quashed after its subverter's espionage recognized their `finest hour' had arrived.  It all seems like a far more diabolical plan the way we're playing it.  We may be a budding sentient species, but we know that `alien's from space' ruse like the pull my finger joke it is, and the joke's over.  The inhumanity of accustomed barbarisms mocks itself in a space invader guise to amuse the docile public who just keeps taking it in the teeth.  Then even Spielberg has to imitate Shyamalan with `War of the Worlds', Cruise is Gibson, Gibson is Cruise-we all saw that mask used in `Mission Impossible'.  Anti-intellectualism does mean deliberately running out of ideas and recycling the bourgeois household gimmicks from a ministry of formulaic, staple disinformation.

The crop circle makers surely know the ecology of our pond, the bottom feeders who try and distract enlightenment, and the controllers who've lost all control and merely have their appearances and back pocket movie makers.  The emperors have no clothes on the crop circles phenomena, it would appear.  A media blackout on crop patterns would only validate them, so a political campaign fought over unspoken philosophic and religious precepts is given lip service out of the side of the mouth--unspoken, because intelligent discourse would only put ideas in people's heads...and we can't have that can we...  The thief isn't going to let on about competition he fears might take what he wants to steal, any part of it.  So by puppeting with it, he appears to only offer considerations-or threatening with the D.O.A. scenario.

The myth of our  humanity, as a cooperative world, is all too clear to sentient surmise...and it is not the myths in these B-grade after-school specials. For substantive content on the crop circles, the reader is deferred to my review of CONTACT, the movie.",1153872000,3,7004,5.204991087344029

1472587,5,B00005JL3T,"This film is fantastic. I was hooked in to the whole aliens invading earth plotline, but there's so much more to it than that, as with any M Night Shyamalan movie. The last ten minutes turns the film totally on its head, making the viewer realise that it was actually about so much more than just aliens landing on earth and attempting to take over. Very moving and a prime example of why not to judge a book by its cover.",1152316800,4,422,4.222222222222222
1472588,3,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan broke out with his first film, The Sixth Sense, a movie that may very well prove to be both his best and most popular. There are worse fates that creating a cultural touchstone in film your first time out. He followed this with what some thought of as the disappointing Unbreakable. In that line of thought, I must agree that his movie about comic book superheroes looked anything but super. But most of that can be attributed to the cinematographer. In its defense, part of the point was to have the film look mundane. It was about a person who discovers that he's a superhero. It's only a surprise to him if his life looks plain and ordinary, like everyone else's.

SIGNS cinematography is much better, more in line with Shyamalan's first film, but in all other ways, plot, pacing, characters, it's a weaker film.

Many reviewers have complained about the emotionless nature of M. Night's characters, and he fairs no better here. There are no characters in this film, just caricatures. There is ""the brainy kid"" who is also ""the kid who won't forgive one parent for the other parent's death."" Not that the child's a bad actor, but he's a Culkin. And let's face it, all the little Culkin Clones make you think about beating the crap out of Joe Pesci on Christmas Eve, not their character.

Then there's ""the cute kid' who is also ""the kinda creepy kid."" Unfortunately, Kinda Creepy Kid was already done, and much better, by Haley Joel Osment, in Shyamalan's own The Sixth Sense.

Next, we have Gladiator's ever-creepy Juaquim Phoenix, not as Mel Gibson's son, but as his brother. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is distracting. I'm sure there's at least 20 years difference in age between Gibson and Phoenix, and on screen it looks more like 30. Brothers? The theater-of-reality is blown in the first scene.

Phoenix's character is an ex-minor league baseball player, for no apparent reason except that it's a convenient plot device when it comes time to beat the bad guy in the last reel. He doesn't play baseball anymore, despite the fact that he holds the minor league record for the longest hit, at 507 feet. With an arm like that, why isn't he playing ball in the big leagues, much less not playing at all? The only reason given is that he also holds the record for the most strike-outs. Sounds like a man who played in the majors in Cleveland for a decade, called Jim Thome. Someone should have told M. Night that the top 8 hitters in major league baseball all had more than 100 strike-outs each their last two seasons each. And that even back when Babe Ruth was the home run leader, he was also the holder of the record for the most strike-outs. So it just doesn't add up.

And don't forget the town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead. The only problem with her is that we just had a town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead, in The Mothman Prophecies. And Laura Linney actually had the opportunity to add a little thing called DEPTH to the character. The actress here is just another cardboard cut-out, that ultimately could've been cut completely from the film without anyone noticing.

But the award for cardboard cut-out character and winner of the prestigious Kevin Costner Wooden Indian Actor Award goes to Mel Gibson. For the first time in film, the man is emotionless, joyless, and humorless. He plays a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. One problem with this is that we saw this character ALSO, just a few years ago when we watched Harvey Keitel play a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Again, with the unfortunate result that the THEFT of this tired, Stock Character was also A bad choice, as that even in that ""We-Know-We're-Making-a-B Movie"" film (From Dusk Till Dawn), Keitel was much much better.

We never believe that Mel Gibson has lost his faith. We don't believe it when his faith is restored (like we don't see that coming), and I don't believe he's a reverend in the first place. At all. Ever. Instead, he walks through the film like the ghost of an actor who used to be allowed to act, or in lieu of that, to at least play the part of Mel Gibson, Superstar. There's nothing to care about in this character, nothing to root for, and nothing heroic. Welcome to the City of Dullsville, Population: Mel.

And let's not forget plot points that make no sense. 'You've locked what you think might be an alien in the pantry.' Do you A) Peek inside to see if you're right; B) Call a neighbor or friend to check with you; C) Go get a weapon, then check; or D) Call in the police ? Why, it's none of the above. It's obviously E) Just go home and forget about it.

While the cinematography and music are both good, gone is the sense of doom around the corner. There are no plot twists, or what-ifs. What starts off as ""What if crop circles were made by aliens"" ends with ""crop circles were made by aliens."" Mel's faith is restored, but for no real reason, nor does he seem glad that it is.

Not a BAD movie, Signs is still the lesser brother of Unbreakable, as Unbreakable was to the Sixth Sense.

1472692,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is a wonderfully entertaining cross genre film that will leave you laughing, searching the skies for aliens, wondering about life, and afraid to go outside in the country at night. Some of the scenes in Signs are the funniest I have seen on film in years, especially the scenes with the tin foil hats.

Signs also can be quite creepy. There are corn field scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. There is also a subtle scene with a trapped alien that, while not scary in a conventional way, is sure to have your heart pounding.

This is also not a hardcore sci-fi film, so do not shy away from it for that reason. Signs is story and character driven. There are touching scenes involving Mel Gibson's dying wife, and well as well played out scenes with the sheriff.

The acting is quirky, but the characters are highly lovable and memorable. This is something that can't be said often for a film.

Signs is not a conventional cookie cutter Hollywood movie, and that is good is you are searching for something quality, yeat slightly off alignment. Some people hate Signs, and some passionately love it. I love it, and own it.

Either way, Signs is a definate must see.

I have watched Signs at least 5 times, and still laugh, cry and jump even when I know what is coming. The movie's horror, comedy and depth are that good.

1472695,5,B00005JL3T,"My wife judges the impact of a movie directly by the effect it has on my vocal abilities. That is, the more I babble once the movie is over, the more powerful the film is deemed to be.

""Signs"" kept me babbling for days. The ending alone is worthy of a discussion lasting long into the night. Assuming you have not yet seen the movie, I'll spare you that lengthy oration.

This is a movie that does not rely on a clever ending. The story itself is captivating and delivered in riveting fashion. We've all spent a few minutes or so imagining it: what would it be like if visitors from another world came here unannounced and threatened our very existence?  ""Signs"" answers that and does so in a you-are-there style.

The invaders (more sensed than seen, which is always an effective way to cause the viewer's muscles to clench) are scary because they are quiet, and skulking and seen mostly from the corners of the eyes. M. Night prefers to give you a glimpse of shadows beneath a door rather than show you the creature outright, and those shadows power the imagination into high gear.

The mood of ""Signs"" is one of constant menace and the story it hangs on is a fascinating one. The movie is a clever marriage of science fiction and horror, a coupling that only works in the right hands. M. Night handles it brilliantly and winds it up at a dizzying pace with more than a few surprises to go with the creeping fright.

All too many of the Amazon reviewers missed the point.  It was shocking to read the reviews (are people really so stupid that they missed the point of the film).  The aliens and crop circles were a unique medium for delivering a much deeper message.  The real point of Signs rested in a question of faith and coinsedence.  Does everything happed for a reason?-- the little girl who never finishes her water, the death of the ministers wife, the baseball bat, and the little boy's asthma-- all of these awkward happenings were essential for the final outcome of the film.

Signs, on the otherhand, went the opposite way. Very little special effects, but far better character development. You cared about the people so that when they were under threat, you wanted to jump into the movie and protect them. The overall theme of the movie is that there is a reason for everything--even disabilities and tragedy.

1472773,5,B00005JL3T,"It's interesting, I'd always liked this movie a lot, but watching it again after a 3 year layoff I finally see just how extraordinarily well done this is. I've watched a helluva lot of horror movies in the past 3 years, and watching this again I really see how it's on a completely different level from the vast majority of them. When it comes to creating a slow rise in tension and simply inserting the supernatural into the apparently real world 'Signs' has few peers. This relates to a small flaw, perhaps: Once we get to the climax, once we've seen all there is to see, the reality proves a little too mundane. But, the strength of the journey itself more than makes up for this slight anticlimax.  This is definitely one of the very best horror movies of the new millenium.

I've heard some complain that the film lacks sight of the big picture due to its exclusive emphasis on the central family but I think that's what really makes it work, what really makes it real. After all, who cares about the big picture? We don't experience the world as a city or nation, we do it as individuals. That and it just allows us to really get to know the characters, and for Shyamalan to create full, real characters rather than just having a pack of cliches in various cities spread out across the nation. (Like you'd see in something like 'Deep Impact', for example.) Phoenix and Gibson are both absolutely great in this film, particularly Phoenix. Gibson's Graham is a little to cold and distant for us to relate to him initially, so we really connect with Phoenix's Merrill first, though I definitely came around to liking Graham as the movie went on. They're both utterly naturalistic, and manage a real severe intensity in the most emotional scenes while still avoiding any histrionics. The two children, Culkin and Breslin, are fine. I'm always leery of children having prominent roles in movies, but Shyamalan largely avoids sentimentalizing them excessively (Morgan is kind of a whiny dork) or earning cheap audience identification. (In the scenes where the kids are in the greatest peril I identified far more with Graham then with the children themselves.)

Certainly, this won't be to everyone's taste as it is extremely low key up until the very end. And I don't mean this simply in the sense that it isn't violent or gory; that's true of a lot of modern horror films. The film simply refuses to show you much of anything through out the vast majority of the run time. There's a lot of noise related horror, obviously, and it goes light on the jump scares. (More amazingly, some of these scare tactics were actually surprising. Even after having seen it a couple of time before a few years back a couple of these were slightly surprising.) The film uses a particularly classic setting, the old siege on the farmhouse a la 'Night of the Living Dead'. Again, the primary siege is just so impressive because it manages real intensity despite the fact that they show you virtually nothing. The true climax is less effective, but it's still fine and is necessary from a thematic standpoint.  Many people  have complained about the `twist' in this film. I've got some news for you: This movie doesn't have a twist.  Morons.

In the end, however, it may be the human element that really makes this movie standout.  It's just a very tragic portrait of a family that has largely fallen apart. I'll admit it, it probably goes a little to far a couple of times, but it also manages a few genuinely moving scenes, which more than compensates. (Particularly note the great scene of Graham and Merrill discussing fate late one night, and Merrill's confronting Graham after the invasion night and so on.) As I always say, I don't really insist that my movies have realistic or likable characters, but the very best ones usually do. And 'Signs' has got that. Furthermore, Shyamalan's dialogue is generally leaps and bounds beyond what you usually see in a horror film, and it's also really quite funny much of the time.

I've heard a lot of morons complain that the aliens here don't behave in a realistic fashion.  I had a long-winded rant worked out in my mind, but these people aren't gonna be convinced by that, or anything, as a matter of fact, so I'll just keep it simple:  It's absurd to claim that the aliens in this behave in an unrealistic fashion because we, the viewer, don't know anything about them.  There are an infinite number of potential explanations for why they act as they do, and 0 reasons to believe they would behave any other way.  Any supposed logic you may have come up with relating to the aliens is irrelevant, because they are wholly of and within the movie.  And perhaps more to the point, this comes with the territory.  Complaining about the aliens in this film is like complaining about how hardly anybody has any guns in a contemporary martial-arts film.

Yes this is a great film. Definitely Shyamalan's best in my mind, as of this moment.

Usually, bad science fiction elements prompt me to throw my popcorn at the screen and walk out, but unlike The Matrix or The Day after Tomorrow, Signs gets away with speculative murder by declining to take itself too seriously and by rendering the characters believably, if narrowly.

High marks to Shymalan for using an alien invasion framework to give us a film with characters that grow and people you really care about.
  Yes it has tons of suspense, atmosphere, humor and shocks, but it also has a heart -- something rare in this genre.  And it's exremely well put together in terms of pacing, construction, acting and creative use of sound.

1472848,2,B00005JL3T,"The universe's most ill prepared aliens attack earth and are beaten back by poor people and farmers. In Signs 2, a herd of aliens allergic to down feathers will attack a huge pillow.

The Movie: I enjoyed Sixth Sense. It was entertaining, it was engaging, had solid acting, and created a genuine tension that justified its long silences. Its structure has been ripped off more than anything except the matrix in the last ten years. The memory is fading however with Unbreakable and now Signs, two films with great potential and no follow through.

Signs is driven by a worldwide alien attack, as witnessed from the perspective of a small conflicted farm family. Decent enough on screen together (led by Mel Gibson as a former priest) the actors in respective roles look and act nothing like a family that lives together, torn apart by death or not. Their lives are changed by crop circles which magically appear overnight in Gibson's corn fields. eventually we learn that these patterns are landing markers for alien invaders. So far so good. According to an early ""probing mission"" (not that kind perv) at the farm, the aliens are athletically gifted enough to outrun a great athlete and jump not only onto a roof but off of it and into distant corn crops. They can also spray poison gas from their wrists. Great, sounds challenging. The aliens attack and have camoflouging devices for their ships that make them invisible to the world. The set up is there for a truly amazing effort to be needed to bring down these guys. They have the technology and athletic ability to dwarf our own, what possible defense is there?

Water.

That's right, these technological geniuses are apparently big fans of advanced stupidity, too. When M. Night Shyamalan guest stars in his movie as the man who accidentally killed the preacher's wife, he was basically there to explain that ""he planned to go to the water"" because apparently ""the aliens don't like water, all the crop circles are inland after all"" right?. (a) the crop circles are probably inland because if you drew them in water they wouldn't stay there.  It's water. (b) landing in the middle of the pacific ocean isn't the best strategy attack wise.(c) why would they attack a planet covered by 70% water where the very atmosphere is filled with it? More obviously if they are able to build such great spacecraft with armor and camoflouge, why not get some body suits with similar technology so that water doesn't destroy them so easily? This isn't where the contradictions end unfortunately. The afore-mentioned athletic ability? It's explained by a child that the aliens wouldn't have much athletic ability because they would be intellectually developed. Well that makes the alien's inability to figure out how to open a door even more infuriating, as well ass the final scene in which one literally doesn't even fight back as its' being pummeled with a baseball bat. There is another scene where, stumbling on a grate as the family is trapped in a basement, a group of aliens attempt to find a way to get at the family. I was excited about this part for a specific reason. All movie long the little girls aversion to water (""it's contaminated"" she keeps repeating) was stressed. There was something different about her when she was born (she didn't cry at birth...) I was fully expecting this was to set up a twist to the effect that she had been tested on by the aliens as a way to research a resistance to the effects water had on them, and that she was somehow linked to them. A combination of human and alien dna with their strengths and less weaknesses? Maybe she was going to turn on her family, but that would have made all that foreshadowing mean something, so that a well directed and smartly paced buildup was worth something? No.  The aliens literally were just trying to figure out a way to get in a basement. Here, an idea. You have shown you have gas that you can emit from your wrists. You face a porous basement. Spray the gas either through that huge grate or underneath the door.

In the end this is the undoing of the movie. The aliens are never scary or very smart. Their design has nothing original to it. They are tall bald skinny green aliens just like any other that you have ever seen in movies, and dumb as a box of hair. I am happy that M. Night gets to write and direct his own stories in a day where 5-6 people seem to write every movie. That does not, however mean that he has lost the need to ask someone to read it before he makes it into a feature. This is lazy filmmaking by a director/writer refusing to challenge himself or the audience, knowing his skill for building suspense will carry his movie on the big screen. Dvd viewing is not as kind

They take way too many liberties with the fact-- I mean, we all lived thru the great Alien invasion of '97, we know what Aliens are really like and how they are repulsed.  Hell, they didn't even have ships when they invaded us.  They just used their wings.  Hell, the aliens in this one didn't even *have* wings.  And everyone knows that real aliens use their hyper-advanced xeno kung fu to kill humans, not poison gas.  And they're repulsed by silver, not tap water, unless that tap water has an unusually large amount of silver in it, which is usually doesn't.  Furthermore, they never even explained how the Aliens actually loved us and came in peace, but they express affection thru murder so we didn't understand and it was all a big misunderstanding, until we fixed it and now we all live in peace with the aliens.  Remember that?  I mean sure, I could accept this movie if there were no alien invasion back in '97, and if we had no concrete evidence as to how aliens behave, or even if they exist.  Then you can have them behave however you want, because as a fictional creation there are no rules, and no reasons to believe the creatures would behave anyway in particular.  In fact, I would even say it would be completely moronic to claim that the aliens in this behaved in an unbelievable manner if we knew absolutely nothing about aliens.  But since we do know all about aliens, this is very major, central concern in the film, which completely kills it, as a matter of fact.",1136332800,2,1606,4.481099656357388

I have seen the signs, too. They are everywhere. They are in the drinking water. They are in the well water. They are in the swimming pool. They are in the hot tub. They are in the Niagra Falls.

They are in the streams. They are in the creeks. They are in the ponds. They are in the puddles.

This is a great movie to watch with the whole family. I love it. Twists and turns and double meanings pervade the movie's script. Mel Gibsen's amazing performance was riveting, as always, though his best performance was on Patsy Kinset in Lethal Weapon 2. He could barely handle her. Joaquin Phoenix's performance rivals Mel's.

1472854,1,B00005JL3T,"This movie would more appropriately be titled ""Crap Circles"", and that might as well be what it is about. For the life of me, I cannot believe this movie has gotten even one positive review. On second thought, I guess I can believe it, considering the level of brain activity left in most human beings as a species. I was keenly interested in the content of this film when it first came out, being as that I have been researching the phenomenon of Crop Circles that have been appearing in southern England and in all parts of the globe since at least 1978. This is a genuine mystery that has been ridiculed and touted as a hoax by those who are either dim witted or those who wish to promote dim wittedness. But the facts are there for anyone who has the will and the desire to find things out for oneself...one website of note would be cropcircleconnector.com, take a look at some of the ""signs"" there and try to convince yourself that these were created only by idjits in a field with wooden boards or by spooky alien geeks.

Instead of giving us a film that explored the mysteries of crop circles, MidNight Scamalon gives us a familiar fright night tale of Bad Old Aliens. Puhlease. Whatever, Stooge. Mel Gibson looking scared and pathetic, boo hoo, I'll never pray again, lame kids screaming. Hasn't this movie been made thousands of times already? Hollywood has been making the same movie over and over and over again, and chumps still buying it!

And what's worse, it's not even scary, or thrilling. It is however, sad. Sad in that so much potential was wasted here. The chance to present a genuine mystery to a large audience and let them question something that would open them to even larger questions. Clearly, this movie was never intended to make you think....it was only created to make you afraid. And it is also sad but true that if you are afraid, you will not think clearly, making it easier for you to be held in a prison of fear.  So, if you are looking for something meaningful related to the Crop Circle Mystery, you will most definitely NOT find it by watching this turd of a movie.

One truly cares for the characters... Gibson's broken and bitter minister... the good ol' boy brother... the two precocious and adorable kids with their neurotic hang ups...

The subtle tension is built up slowly. The windy cornfields are full of mystery and foreboding. An alien leg slipping into the cornstalks... an alien hand slipping under a door.... this stuff is masterful, and much scarier than a full blown, CGI confrontation with a well detailed monster...

This is what Shymalan does well. He recaptures a Hitchcock style. He harkens back to the films of yesteryear. One DOES NOT NEED TO SEE EVERYTHING!!

How effective it was to see Mel Gibson look out his window, and proclaim ""It's happening."" Much scarier than a scene depicting a well detailed spacecraft landing in the field.

The soundtrack is awesome, and the story ties everything together at the end... making a case for faith...faith triumphing over ""coincidence.""

 The only weaknesses of the film would be in the story itself... why are the aliens so stupid? They need crop signs to navigate? They can't get through blocked doorways? (SPOILER) They are vulnerable to water, and they land on a planet that's mostly water?

Perhaps the alien predators are meant to be stupid. For all we know, they aren't the creators of the spacecraft they arrive on... and they just go planet to planet, hoping to not meet resistence.

This is simply an incredible, emotional film. It's message promoting faith is one I especially appreciate.

1472856,5,B00005JL3T,"Frankly, I don't like giving good reviews, nor paying complements to a young director who strikes me as somewhat arrogant.  It took me several viewings to accept this movie as something worthy of even a 2-star rating.  Having enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"", I was terribly disappointed in ""Signs"" when I saw it in the theater, feeling that it was ultimately a silly little film about Martians.  Now, even as a curmudgeon who doesn't want to concede admiration, I must confess that ""Signs"" is, to me, one of the greatest, most moving films made in recent decades.

After watching the DVD (a gift), I found my curiosity piqued in a very mild and intangible way.  I was compelled to watch it many more times, continuously, relentlessly.  I provide my opinion here simply to help potential viewers avoid disappointment: my only advice is to disregard the notion that this will be a horror movie.  Senses of horror will likely come afterwards, in recollections and musings, with very few shocker-seens during the movie.

The key is, I think, to realize that this movie is about the events, great and small, that comprise our lives, our sense of self and of others.  There is nothing in this film that lacks significance in some way; that can be said about much good literature and cinema, works of art that have been very carefully crafted, but this is the only film that truly hinges on the content of every single frame.  Every subtlety is important, every word, every sound... from the almost imperceptable softness of wind chimes and chirping insects to the trilling vocalizations and scurrying footsteps of unseen invaders, the phenomenal music and intensely quiet pace that carries the whole movie, the characters' deep sighs, vocal inflections, subtle facial communications, slight nuances in dialect such as the locality's accentuated ""T"" consonances...

Once the realization comes that everything in this movie is necessary, the emotive power becomes overwhelming, the true horrors become apparent, the thoughtfulness and awareness pervading the movie is made tangible, and the events taking place in the movie saturate one's senses.

Perhaps this review is not very informative, but it seems important to emphasize that this movie is far more dramatic than scary, and would have benefited from being marketed that way; viewers will appreciate ""Signs"" far more if they are not lured into expectations of horror and suspense in any traditional way, but rather into an emotional, truly heart-wrenching story of people who are simply trying to live in the way we all must, through the mundane and the complicated, banal and urgent, random and yet somehow cohesive events that all people live through, that we are all trying to live through, right now.",1134604800,6,2747,5.053097345132743

At no time are there Big Explosions from our usual response to a threat, oh, say alien spaceships hovering over major cities (which leads me to believe that this is not even a Hollywood movie).  Nope, it's a ""wait and see"" approach here (maybe they were hoping for rain). And what were the aliens going to do with the planet or us after we'd been conquered?  Planet covered by water, not really a vacation paradise for them, maybe they were going to tow it away and use it as a weapon.  People made of mostly water, they couldn't eat us, maybe they burn us as fuel. Given their observed level of technical sophistication, one could suppose their spaceships might have been of the steam powered variety.

Yes, this movie provides more questions than answers.  ""Why would somebody buy the DVD if they saw the movie?"" or ""How much did they have to pay Mel Gibson to be in it""? and ""Did they not let him read the script before he signed the contract?""

Watch ""Manos: 'The Hands of Fate'"" instead, it's at least as 'scary' as this movie, though in a different way.",1133136000,12,2076,4.608695652173913
1472940,2,B00005JL3T,"Is director M. Night Shyamalan returning to his roots? His first film (which only played at the Toronto Film Festival in 1992), Praying With Anger, explored some religious themes. Signs not only explores them, it exhausts them. If you go into the theater expecting a scary, action-packed chiller with freaky aliens and lots of special effects, you might be looking for other signs, the ones that say EXIT. If however, you're willing to settle for a drama about a man who's lost his faith in God and struggles to find it again when faced with a life and death struggle, you just might like Signs. It's not a bad movie, but it's not what it's being marketed as. I have a feeling that at least one of the crop circles was made by the missing reel that would have made this movie pay off its marketing plot.

Billed as a thriller, Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and stars Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a recently widowed, recently retired preacher, raising two small children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and supporting his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) on the sprawling family farm. The signs start to occur right away, when crop circles appear in Hess's cornfield. Without much time to decide whether or not the circles are the work of pranksters, the news media announces that aliens have invaded the world and they're not here to use the telephone.

Between the buildup (there are some excellent 'fakeout' scares), there are lots of flashbacks designed to show us why Hess lost his faith. His wife was hit by an inattentive director, er, driver (played by Shyamalan) while out on a late night walk on one of the country roads. Mrs. Hess, of course, hangs on just long enough to deliver some prophetic last words to her husband. (The other unforgivable clich in the movie is the asthmatic child locked in a small room, separated from his precious medicine, while the bad guys roam the home.)

Like Unbreakable, Shyamalan's second major feature, Signs takes a very long time to get to the point. And just when it seems like things are about to get exciting, it's decided that locking everyone in a dark coal cellar, where nobody (including the audience) can see anything, is a good idea. The cinematography (by the usually very capable Tak Fujimoto), is often too dim, flat, and muddied.

You could say Signs is an amalgam of The Apostle, The Blair Witch Project, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Panic Room, and The Natural. I've heard some 'crap circles' grumblings from the movie-going ranks, and someone else compared The Sixth Sense director's batting average to the Phoenix character in Signs: he's a failed baseball player who struck out too many times and has found himself in limbo. Shyamalan hit the ball out of the park with The Sixth Sense, but now he's got two strikes with Unbreakable and Signs. One more and is he out? It may seem unfair to compare his three major motion pictures this way, but that's what moviegoers do. They try to make informed decisions on what they've seen before, before parting with their hard-earned dollars.

In Signs, there are some excellent moments of suspense. You hear more than you see, and that works beautifully in connection with the understated, eerie score by James Newton Howard. Unfortunately, there are long stretches of downtime and distracting flashbacks between the moments of suspense. It's too bad, because Shyamalan is talented, and I know he is capable of ratcheting up the suspense levels to all-time highs. But in this case, it looks like he fell in love with the idea of ""two kinds of people"" (you have to see the movie to get that) and forgot he was making Signs for the general masses.

There are bits and pieces of a good, scary story here, and the cast is definitely above par. Gibson paired with Shyamalan, and the promise of creepy aliens, is bound to bring in some dollar signs at the box office. Whether or not it will have legs depends on whether or not the audiences will accept that the sci-fi element is just a facade for the movie's true wares: a ponderous sermon on spirituality rising above the threat of 'the devil'.",1132617600,3,4114,4.730822873082287

It's fun to watch a thriller like Panic Room or Wait until Dark, where both the hunted and hunters prove formidable opponents. In this movie, both proved imbeciles. The human characters and aliens are both incredibly stupid.

There is a giant crop circle in my backyard. All around the world, similar ""signs"" are appearing, and the news tells me that aliens only appear to capture and kill humans within a few square miles of crop circles.  Also, they hate water, and a friend tells me he's going to a nearby lake to be safe.  What should I do??

If I'm Mel Gibson in this movie, the answer is: stay in my house, attempt to board up the windows and doors but run out of boards.  Genius.

I'm an alien.  I've travelled with a malicious purpose across the galaxies using radically advanced hyperspace technology.  My spaceship can turn INVISIBLE and I have poison darts that come out of my friggin' wrists.  I'm the coolest lifeform in the universe.  I'm trying to kill a family of stupid hicks who try to board up their windows but run out of boards.  How should I go about it?

The answer: Get trapped in a room because I can't figure out how to PICK A LOCK or KICK DOWN A WOODEN FREAKIN' DOOR.

Do you get my point yet?  Aside from the criminally dumb script which has a minister regaining his faith amidst the alien invasion (God's idea of a joke?), the movie is actually well-made with some creepy scenes.  But ultimately the gaping plotholes make this one a joke.

This is a perfect example of why that which is not seen (or seen in very brief moments) is 100% scarier than that which can be gawked at (constrast with Spielbergs War of the Worlds, an annoying, non suspenseful, unscary exercise in 'special effects' with no  rational purpose behind anything that happened in the movie except people running screaming from big machines zapping them and listening to Dakota fannings repeated high pitched screams)

If you follow the instructions in the first paragraph, I guaratee you will not be disappointed.

The acting is brilliant: Mel, Joaquin, the kids, all of them.  The music is chilling, the cinematography is perfect.  The theme of Mel's character's struggle with faith is powerful.

1472943,2,B00005JL3T,"Signs.

I've held off for years seeing this. As stories about crop circles tend to not interest me. On a whim last night I mindmelded with the couch and watched this whole film.

Verdict is ** 1/2 stars. Why?  Its a strange film mixing one mans path to redemption (Gibson) and the aliens-are-coming-to-kill-us -all flick. What this film does differently than many of the aliens-are-coming-to-kill-us flicks is that most of the action centers on Gibson's property and very little elsewhere.

The director does set successfully a creepy tone of tension throughout the movie which in my opinion never really pays off. As the story climaxes it just doesn't sell itself to me. The bad guys have you trapped in the basement then all of a sudden decide to go home. Leaving scared humans in the basement.

You'd think then that'd be it end of credits with hugs for all. Nope! After a tense night, coming out of the basement and receiving news of the bad guys left one is still in your house! Not only one, but one that is totally unbelievable looking. The alien looked like a digital effect more than a living and breathing creature. CG aliens don't cut it with me. Might for the younger generation - I prefer a film to at least try to make an alien tangible. These aliens were not.

Then we find out its water that kills these alien folk. We have such a lauded director going for a beat to death device that defeats that aliens. You'd think that with all the singing of praise for Mr Shyamalan gets he'd pull a more creative plot device out of his back pocket. The baby monitor too I thought was a bit hokey.

For the at times cheesiness of the story. There are moments it really connects. The study in human paranoia is interesting. The atmosphere and the vibe are very well done. The flashlight scene in the cornfield had good tension too.

In the end though. I'm forced to say its not a great film. I agree with the previous reviewer that called it a B film. It defintely has that feel. It just wasn't a satisfying journey for me. I grant that Shyamalan has a great style. His stories need work though.

As for one reviewer calling those of us who don't bow at the knees of Shyamalan stupid. You out yourself as a silly little cretin if you cannot handle opinions that don't jive with yours. There is more to films than director worship.",1131408000,2,2333,4.4834905660377355
1472944,5,B00005JL3T,"When I saw the preview for this movie back in 2001 I knew this was going to be good.  I did not have internet at the time so I would always watch the preview at my aunt's house as much as possible.  Now that I do have internet and the chance to read all the garbage the idiots are putting about this movie I'm going to express my feelings and the facts.

1) First of all I am so sick of people complaining that the movie was stupid because the aliens were allergic to water and that the earth is made of 75% water and so on.  Who cares!  The movie is not about the aliens!!!  It does not take a genius to know that the real plot line is about a man (Mel Gibson) struggling with his belief in God and the fact aliens might be taking over the world.  Duh!!!  How dumb are we???

2) I hate it when people trash talk the acting in ""Signs"".  The acting is amazing and is extremely real.  The people who makes fun of the movie's acting ability is probably some nerd that can't even get up on stage and say two words without pissing their pants.  The bottom line, if you can do better acting then Mel Gibson, Joaquin Pheonix, or any of the two children in ""Signs"", I want to see you be a star in a movie and impress me because as far as I'm concerned they are the ones making lots of money and were chosen for that part for a reason.

SPOILER!!!  DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING OF ""SIGNS"".  I AM USING THE TWIST TO YELL AT PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY KNEW THE ENDING.

3) Whoever says that they could predicted the ending in ""Signs"" is  by far the most pathetic liar in the world.  By what I mean is if you knew the twist (most people said they could predict it by the opening credits) you already knew that Morgan's asthma was going to save him from the poisonous gas the aliens would spray out, which the movie doesn't tell us the aliens had poisonous gas until towards the end of the film.  That means you also knew Bo's picky water habit was going to save them by leaving them scattered around the living room, you knew the aliens were allergic to water, you knew ""swing away"" meant Merrill was going to kill the alien by the baseball bat hanging up on the wall, and you knew the alien was going to come back in the first place for revenge.  I HIGHLY doubt anyone knew all that information before the movie's climax.

4)  It is retarded when people try to use an anology to state thier opinion.  For example, ""My God, my three-year-old cousin could direct and write a better movie than this.""  This quote came from an adult that was reviewing ""Signs"" on this website.  It shows how low and stupid people can possibly be.

There are many things I have to say to the low lifes dissing M. Night, but I know that they can't even write or direct a better movie.  [...]I will be glad to read your sad opinions and I am looking for a good laugh.  Anyway M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN IS A TALENTED DIRECTOR AND ONLY IDIOTS, FOOLS, AND RETARDS CAN'T SEE THAT!!!  Also I learned that you can't please everybody, but if you are going to hate ""Signs"", have a better excuse then, ""the aliens were allergic to water they should've had armor on!""",1130457600,,3135,4.169717138103161
1472945,5,B00005JL3T,"When I first saw this film in 2002, it was and still remains the only movie that has ever truly scared me. Of course, my taste has changed considerably since those days, so I recently decided to revisit the film. Upon rewatching it, I've found myself more impressed than I've ever been with this masterpiece.

The story follows Graham Hess (Gibson), a former reverend torn apart by the loss of his wife; his two children Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin); and his brother, Merrill (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball star. This already stressed out family is put under a considerably heavier trial when they find mysterious patterns in their crops and are then tormented by the following alien invasion of Earth.

""Signs"" is the perfect example of the ""less is more"" approach. Director M. Night Shyamalan builds the tension so expertly throughout the film using nothing but silence and clever camera angles that by the time the climax arrives my chest is about to explode. In fact, I have never seen another film that utilizes silence and shadows so well, it's really what makes the film so scary for me. Anytime we see any part of the aliens, it's always so brief or obscured that we're never really sure what it was that we just saw.

However, the film does contain some rather illogical flaws, but for the sake of spoilers, I won't go into them. Besides, I, for one, was too immersed in the story to care.

Another thing I greatly appreciated in ""Signs"" was James Newton Howard's excellent score. It was not ubiquitous, clich, or intrusive like the identical ""original"" scores in all the Hollywood fright films of late. It was there when it should have been and it wasn't when it shouldn't have been.

But ""Signs"" is not just a frightening sci-fi film, it is also a film about faith. Graham is a man struggling with his beliefs, which leads to a rather powerful scene toward the end of the film in which he must talk his son through a violent asthma attack while exclaiming ""I hate you!"" at God. Such scenes are also quite demanding from an acting standpoint, and the acting is capably handled by both of the leading men and also by the small band of supporting actors. Oh, this reminds me, keep your eyes open for a cool little cameo by Stella's Michael Showalter.

On top of all this, the film also features beautiful, vivid cinematography and genuinely ingenius, fluid camera movements from Shyamalan.

I guess ""Signs"" is one of those ""love it or hate it"" films, as I have heard lots of opinions on both sides of the spectrum and not too many in the gray area. As you have probably noticed, I am one of those who love it and I will watch and enjoy this excellent piece of cinema for years to come.

This movie falls outside of what people expect and profits off of the expectations we have of modern-day cinema, and I think that makes them uncomfortable. Signs does not aspire to be a drama, science fiction movie, or action movie. Signs is a means to an end. What I loved most about SIGNS, and what makes it the scariest movie I have seen (I literally taped my windows shut with towels so that I could sleep) is it's occupation with the character's reactions versus what it is that is scaring them. What makes this movie so scary is not the typical way in which movie-makers terrify their audiences, SIGNS is scary because we are sharing the character's emotions and experience. Shyamalan uses our ability to empathize and relate to others (and the situation they are in) to terrify us, and give us hope. We are not scared by the surface or physicality of the thing causing anxiety or fear. We are afraid because the character's are afraid, and we can see it. This is the ultimate scare-movie for people affected by other's emotions. It is beautiful because of it, and the science of the film takes a back-seat, almost necessarily in this film and further emphasizes it's unique approach and success. Movies don't have to BE anything. This movie isn't for everyone, and it will not be appreciated by everyone. I own it, and I love it.

1473099,4,B00005JL3T,"With M. Night Shyamalan's third major studio release as director, he once again proved that he may just be heir to the Hitchcock throne of suspense.  Do not think I am comparing him to the level of Hitchcock as a film maker, because Shyamalan still has a long way to go to achieve that goal.  However, of the film makers today you'd be hard pressed to find a director who could produce such a suspenseful film on such minimalist methods.

 Hollywood's mentality has long been the bigger the explosion the bigger the return, and in an age of special effects and showing off what they can do on the computer (take note, George Lucas), Shyamalan bypassed all that and harkened back to a time when the most important thing was the story.  Shyamalan constructed the film around the history and idiosyncracies of the family using everyday things such as half-filled glasses, a baby monitor, and other like things.  When Spielberg directed Jaws, he learned that by not showing the shark that much made the film much more effective (admittedly, this realisation came to be because JAWS was such a production disastor).  In a time when we have the specials effects to envision anything you could possibly dream, this film aptly illustrates that just because you have the technology it doesn't mean you have to use it to tell a good story.  The old adage of ""less is more"" fits wonderfully here. Another wonderful example that incorporates technology without sacrificing the story or characters is Minority Report.

 What is so remarkable about Signs' plot?  It's the fact that the characters exist in their own right and never feel like just plot devices or mouthpieces.  Mel Gibson plays an apostate preacher who suddenly has to handle the fact that crop circles are appearing in his corn field.  Simultaneously, all across the globe crop circles are, shall we say, cropping up.  His children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix from Gladiator) begin believing in the aliens, and try as he might Gibson's character realizes that these crop circles won't just go away.  The movie then moves to the question is are these alien formations, and if so what are they used for?  If there are aliens, are they hostile or not?  What do they want with Earth?

 Because Shyamalan always mades sure the Gibson's character and his family are in the forefront, the viewer becomes involved with them as individual characters to the point where the aliens are more events anything else.  More and more scripts have characters taking backseat to the special effects and this is sapping the film industry of vitality.  In Signs, when Morgan (the son)  has his asthma attack during an assault on the house, we are much more concerned with what effect it would have on the family if they lost him, instead of it being some cheap and lowbrow ploy that is more of a plot device than a character study (Panic Room anyone?).

 One of the key themes in Signs is faith.  This film deals with the anger that Gibson's character feels toward God and how he must work through that throughout life's circumstances.  Shyamalan's character (yes, he acts) is responsible for Gibson losing his faith.  The film traces Gibson's progression of losing his faith and then struggling with God over losing his wife.  This is illustrated ingeniously in the film's climax.

 While my faith in God hasn't left me, my faith in Hollywood has long since evaporated.  With directors such as Shyamalan still on the go-around, I find it getting a little stronger everyday.",1122163200,5,3542,4.833887043189368
1473100,2,B00005JL3T,"In what has to be the worst sci-fi movie ever, Shyamalan
takes the H.G.Wells premise to an absurd level. As I'm sure you know,in Wells ""War of the Worlds"", the invading Martians fall victim to the simplest of threats. The common bacteria that is part of daily life on the Earth. Something the Martians hadnt considered as a threat due to their ignorance of it.  Thus the ""devil in the details"" punchline of the story.
But in ""Signs"",The bad space guys are like...hyper allergic to water...(The stuff that covers  79% of the Earths surface).These bad space guys, they can  master space travel But cant figure out that the Earth, being covered with water, might not be the best place to start a shooting war. Had they considered rain?
I can understand the Martians, in ""War of the Worlds"", not being completely squared away on the bacteria issue. But to have water as your primary tactical weakness, and not notice that the whole place is covered with the stuff, can only bring to question the intelligence of this menace from space.
One reason why Hitler didn't go after Switzerland was that he didn't want to get cut to pieces in the Alps. But these arch-evil space guys,(who of course utilize surprisingly substandard communications equipment),dont have the tactical wherewithal to ask themsevles just what they were going to do with a water covered planet in the first place.

Rent it if you want to, but know that it isn't scary AT ALL!",1119830400,,625,4.040322580645161
1473103,4,B00005JL3T,"This movie has become a favorite of mine. I initially avoided this movie in the theater as I heard it was about aliens. But I rented it and I was incredibly moved. People who think that this movie is about aliens are missing the point of the movie. (The aliens aspect of the movie does bother me a bit but can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the movie). ""Signs"" should be watched from the perspective of Mel Gibson's character, Graham Hess. The various quirks in the Hess family - Merrill's (Joaquin Phoenix) ability to swing the bat but failure to make the big leagues; Morgan's (Rory Culkin) asthma, Bo's (Abigail Breslin) neurotic behavior with drinking water; and his wife's dying words all come together to give meaning to Graham to show him that this was all in the plans for him including the landing of the aliens.  Is the ending contrived? Sure. It's a movie after all. What movie isn't? And while aliens are a part of the storyline, the movie isn't about aliens as it is about faith- the loss and recapture thereof. ""Signs"" addresses a couple big 'life' questions: (1) Have you ever wondered whether God is really watching over you? (2) And then realize that God has been there the whole time but you failed to see it? This is the crux of ""Signs"".",1116892800,6,1262,4.510917030567685
1473104,5,B00005JL3T,"Because of its well-developed characterization of Rev. Hess and the slow crescendo of tensions to a grand finale,and its message of faith regained, I liked this film.  It is also at least as good as Shyamalan's next film ""The Village"" and probably better. I also view both films as extremely silly at some levels, though entertaining, capitalizing on man's primordial fear of the unknown, very much like ""The Twilight Zone"" tv series did. Hess' and brother Merrill's are the only fully developed characters in ""Signs"",though the film is actually in most ways child-centered. Both films  show antipathy to the modern world, particularly ""The Village"" which takes place in an anachronistic commune, which like other historic or present communes has deliberately set itself apart from society's mainstream to achieve a  goal-- to protect its members, particularly its children, from the evils of the modern world.  However wise the goal, the tactics, which include brainwashing and a concentration camp mentality, are suspect, so the story has elements of black humour. I consider it camp or corny because of its stilted, formalized quasi-Amish 1890's dialogue and several deadweight scenes with the elders. The use of high priced talent like Hurt and Weaver in such vapid dialogue could justifiably be considered wickedly wasteful.
 Both films make noble efforts at historicism. The choice of  Bucks County, Pa. as the setting for ""Signs""is  rather inspired  and adds to the film's beauty and uniqueness. Details such as an antique bedframe, wallpaper, a fireplace,stained glass,cut vegetables, photographs and paintings,a barbecue area,windchimes, Pennsylvania Dutch woodcuts and gingerbread trim, a basement pantry stocked with canned goods, are notable.  The pace of both these films is measured and rather slow,out there among the cornfields or in the village, somewhat like a Stephen King novel set in Maine. We don't see much of the aliens--a leg here, a hand there--until the final scene, a restrained dramatic strategy that seems to work very well, like a rare vision of the Loch Ness monster. The alien is also shown several times by reflections.
  ""Signs"" does not bludgeon you  with its pseudo-science, like the film ""Contact"" does. It quietly states its theories in the appropriate time and place.  The rich characterization of the Father/Reverend Hess  is done through flashbacks: like the elders  in ""The Village"" who have all experienced tragedy, this humble man has lost his wife in a horrific traffic accident, an event which has caused him to lose his faith. The question that confronts the Reverend is whether an act of providence can be considered a miracle (a sign) or just pure blind luck. Is there such a thing as coincidence? The Reverend, during the bulk of the film, no longer wants to be called Father. This film's Christianity and exposition of faith is one of its most compelling qualities.

 His brother Merrill plays effective counterpoint as an ex-baseball player-- a fact of considerable importance in the film's harrowing last scenes.  The aliens which are given lots of  airtime worldwide on tv,
start out by clearing areas in cornfields as navigational aids,which Merrill at first dismisses to the Reverend's two children as a prank by ""nerds who can't find girlfriends."" The Reverend is equally skeptical initially. These signs show up all over the world--in India particularly.

  Despite some bad reviews, some wooden acting and deadly if unintentionally funny dialogue, I thought the cinematography of ""The Village"" made up for some of its deficiencies.  I liked Adrien Brody's performance as the village retard, and Joachin Phoenix is not too bad as the virile, brave Lucius Hunt who courts Ivy Walker after rejecting her sister. I thought Shyamalan does a very effective job of conveying a sense of subtle terror throughout, especially in  the very scary woods scenes towards the end, the fairytale-like use of the ""good"" and ""bad"" colors, as well as in the use of numerous historic details and walk-on characters. Some scenes work well (as when elder Edward Walker describes to the children the truce between the village and ""Those We Don't Speak Of""), others less well. I liked the ""dare"" scenes on the edge of the forest, and I liked the scenes in the lookout tower. The idea of going to get medicines from the town is a workable one, as is the idea of using blind Ivy to fetch the medicines because she is more capable than others.  But the movie suffers from a deadly lack of pacing. I think you have to balance the positive with the negative and overall I think the film is worth watching but unfortunately not quite as good as ""Signs.""",1116806400,,4682,5.080939947780679
1473105,3,B00005JL3T,"Finally saw this the other day and... it was okay, but it reminded me a bit of 'Secret Window' in that it had a decent, albeit slow, spooky build up that just fizzled out.  Mel Gibson phones in another performance, and Home Alone's brother is the better actor in the family, but Joaquin Phoenix, though a bit wooden at times, was good.  Overall, I too liked the glasses of water slant, but one thing that I can't get past is this:  How could aliens find their way to earth, make these incredible crop circles, be invisible during the day, and yet not have a plan to deal with a substance that makes up over 70% of the earth???  Maybe it WAS just a coincidence.",1114560000,,660,4.298387096774194
1473106,4,B00005JL3T,"Mel Gibson certanly wasn't stellar in this movie, but he wasn't bad either. There's really no excitment until near the ending of the movie. Before that, there's only events leading up to it, very slowly, but there's only crop circles and short flashes of things running past the house and into the cornfield. Not your typical alien thriller, yet some things never change. For instance, the Aliens always have bug eyes and from tapered fingers. For once couldn't they look a tad bit more human? Or am I thinking to Star Trekish?

The glasses of water lined up around the house was a nice touch however. And unlike the sixth sense, the only true freaky part was when the alien was trapped in the pantry. I truly expected something dire to happen to Mel. Such as his fingers getting chopped off....Not a bad movie for scifi enthusiests, but not really entertaning for others not into such genre's.",1114214400,2,894,4.694267515923567
1473107,5,B00005JL3T,"Thought provoking and multi-layered, this ""the aliens are coming"" film goes way beyond its genre, and though it can be heart-thumping scary, it's also balanced with humor, as well as being full of symbolic meaning, and very moving in parts.

The story centers on Reverend Graham Hess, who battles his inner demons as he prepares to confront the alien invaders; haunted by his wife's tragic death which made him question and negate his faith, he is left with two small children to figure out the meaning of life, and consider if ""it is possible that there are no coincidences"".

Woven throughout the film are flashbacks of his wife's accident, so we get to know this man, in his stages of grief, courage, and reconciliation; Mel Gibson's performance is superb as Hess, with a great depth of emotion, and the others in this small cast are excellent, which includes writer/director Shyamalan and Joaquin Phoenix as Hess' brother. The children, Rory Culkin (from the large Culkin clan that includes aunt Bonnie Bedelia), and Abigail Bresslin, a truly angelic little girl, are both fantastic and enormously appealing. Also good are Cherry Jones as Officer Paski, and Merrit Weaver as a penitent pharmacist.

The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is vibrant, and James Newton Howard's score is one of his best. This brilliantly constructed film is my favorite of Shyamalan's work, and it's one that should be seen at least twice to appreciate, as there is much more to it than meets the eye at first viewing, and it has something that is rare in films, a simple, meaningful, and perfect ending.

Total running time is 106 minutes.

The DVD ""extras"" include a ""making of"" documentary that is extremely interesting, and should not be missed, with Shyamalan explaining his meticulous way of working, from the seeds of the idea to the scoring of the film, a process that I find fascinating.",1113609600,2,1877,4.927215189873418
1473196,5,B00005JL3T,"I think too many people have come to expect Independence Day and Armageddon style movies when it comes to sci-fi.  This movie shows what so-called ""horror"" movies of the last 15 years have been missing..........tension, chills, and suspense.  The filmaker isn't trying to remake War of the Worlds, and he isn't trying to make a super-scientific documentary.  No movie can do all those things and still be worth the entertainment of watching it.  Sure, the characters in the film, at times, do things that are not very logical for someone in their predicament.....but you find such things in virtually every film ever made.

Also, alot of critics of this film were upset at the lack of attention given to the whole big picture of the invasion...and the aliens as characters. That's not what the film is about.  It's not about how a race of aliens try to take over the earth, it's about how one family deals with, and survives, such an invasion. If you want the whole situation explained to the hilt, and the focus put squarely on the extraterrestrials.....watch Predator or one of the Alien movies.

If you can, as with any movie, suspend disbelief and just take in what the movie is providing, then you will enjoy this film.  The only people who will not like this film are action junkies and fans of the stupid ""pop-movie"" phenomenon.  I will throw one more shot in by saying that this was a far better film than The Sixth Sense....which was long, boring, and made me completely unable to suspend disbelief as I was able to do with this movie.

I personally applaud Shyamalan for taking the riskier, less popular approach to the alien invasion movie genre.  Maybe you won't feel the same, but not every movie can appeal to everyone.  As for me, I enjoyed Signs very much.  The characters are not hollow and there is an underlying sense of heart to the story that you usually don't get in a sci-fi flick.  And there simply hasn't been a movie in the better part of the last 10 years that has had moments that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up......but this one did.  Maybe, it's because deep down you know that there's nothing that says something like this can't, or ever will, happen. (unless you're naive)",1113091200,3,2220,4.6132315521628495
1473197,3,B00005JL3T,"The real intrigue of this film lies not in the struggle with an alien invasion but in the inner struggle of Mel Gibson's character.

Mel has arrived at a state of unbelief and anger with God after the tragic death of his wife. The former priest doubts all the things he once held as true. Anyone who has been disappointed by God can relate to the questions, the loss, and the fear of this lonely, disbelieving father.

But when events press him to his knees, when all other recourse is stripped away, he turns to the God who never left him and finds an answer to prayer and the seeds of a renewed faith. For those who walk by faith and not by sight, many have been in similar places to this character. And a piece of ourselves lay broken and wanting until the Father reached into our lives to heal and to mend.

This is the moment that redeems an otherwise cheesey film and weak plot.",1111795200,2,884,4.281437125748503
1473198,1,B00005JL3T,"Reading the other customer reviews makes it evident that ""Signs"" is about a lot of things. Personally, I found this movie to be a wonderful and timely study of how certain minds in this world perceive the nature of evil and how to confront it.

With this idea in mind, I sat through this stinker out of sheer disbelief and with a somewhat perverse delight over a plot where the fuse burns with difficulty and there's nothing close to a pop at the end.  The hand-wringing throughout this movie is truly tortuous.  No coincidence then, that on the night when the alien invasion is pressed across the world, one of the characters huddles in a closet with the TV on --  the director's way of telling us the battle is raging in the distant cities and that others are doing the fighting and dying that will result in this family's liberation.

OK, so this is not meant to be a shoot-em-up space invasion flick; we get that. Even so, the behavior of these characters in the face of a threat was so annoying, I felt no empathy for them and instead, found myself wishing for their blubbering demise well before the final scene.

The truly frightening thing about ""Signs"" is the thought process of the people who made the movie, and that of the people in power today who are of the same mindset.  That truly scares the hell out of me.",1109894400,11,1324,4.446280991735537

Ever since his wife died, Graham has quit his job as a revrend and his brother, Merril(Juaquin Phoenix) moved in with him and his family. One day, there are mysterious crop circles in the field and the family is led to believe that aliens are responsible. At first, Graham is skeptical of the idea but after seeing an aliens leg in the cornfield, he will soon believe that there really are aliens taking over the world.

1473201,1,B00005JL3T,"Shyamalan's movies seem to appeal to the types who believe that facile,drippy new age mysticism is in some way profound. Sixth Sense was far from a great movie,but at least it had a bit of life. Unbreakable,Signs,and The Village are dead on arrival,and tedious almost beyond belief.

Signs finds Shyamalan again coaxing numerous non-performances out of his actors,but it's hard to see them do much with the lame script. Scenes play out with funereal grimness,as Gibson and company sleepwalk through the movie. In fact,all of M.'s actor's seem as if they've been kept awake for six or seven days solid prior to filming. I suppose this passes for 'drama'.

Others have described the dopey mysticism on which the plot is based,and it is,indeed,dopey,so I won't go into it again.

The most mystical thing to me is why so many buy into this director's schlock--I was certainly willing to give him a chance,but I will never watch another of his movies. Another Hitchcock he is most certainly not--Hitchcock's movies were always full of life and wit. Shyamalan is the anti-Hitchcock. For the many people who seem to have gotten some enjoyment out of Signs,more power to you. This is still objectively an embarrassing movie,however.",1109030400,15,1224,5.019704433497537
1473202,5,B00005JL3T,"The response to this movie, and the movie itself, is like a lot of things in life: complex and subjective. This movie worked for me in ways that did obviously not work for others. The movie had moments of real power buttressed by excellent acting (down to assured and realistic perfomances by the children), tight, natural dialog, and outstanding direction. People talk about how creepy this movie is and what makes this true is how isolated all the characters are: no one feels truly safe when the truly extraordinary happens. This movie engrossed me completely....I found it fascinating.

As many people have pointed out, the movie hinges on the question of lost faith and, while this is true, I think the question of faith is much broader here than in strictly a religious sense. The movie's power comes from the universal love/hate relationship that we all have with the particular world view that is the foundation of who we are. In the case of Mel Gibson's character, he tries to deny any further relationship with God. But anyone who has ever had a crisis of faith, whether it be in one's church, in God, in humanity, in a relationship, in science, in whether the Red Sox will ever overcome the Curse of the Bambino (and we all now know the answer to that one), knows how hard it is to simply shut down the object of one's faith. And it is quite likely that we will return to that object of faith because we ultimately do not have a choice. In this movie, the aliens serve merely as the vehicle to make this point.

I'll admit, I loved this movie for the ways the characters interacted and for the movie's message. I think it deserves a look by anyone who loves film.",1108857600,3,1674,4.539735099337748
1473203,2,B00005JL3T,"SIGNS is one of those shows where the trailer is far better and more intense than the actual movie. Everything that is supposedly scary about this one (and I emphasize the word ""supposedly"") is revealed in the trailer.  Think about it.  What else is there?  I felt like standing up and shouting out at the top of my lungs, ""SHOW ME THE ALIENS!!!!""  Instead I got bits and pieces, here and there and nothing else.  Legs in cornfields.  Clawed fingers coming under and around doors.  Spanish-speaking kids (perhaps the most frightening scene of all) suddenly speaking in English so that we, the viewers, don't get lost? Not much more. Even at the climax of the story there isn't the definitive exposure that this movie (and its audience) screams for.

What did M. Night think he was doing?  Thank goodness he didn't follow the same strategy with THE SIXTH SENSE or that one would have been equally boring.

1473205,1,B00005JL3T,"I guess it would be fair to call M. Night Shyamalan ""the next Speilberg,"" because his forte is making big expensive pieces of crap designed for mass-market consumption.  The difference might be that while Speilberg liked to set up corny action-figure-style battles for the fate of the universe (or whatever), in which the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black purely for your ease of distinguishing between the two, Shyamalan likes to set up lame, schlocky ""thrillers"" with ""shock endings"" so utterly obvious that I have a bridge to sell to anybody who can't guess the twist by the end of the opening credits.

""The Sixth Sense""?  Fine, we'll let that one slide; after all it's hard to be objective about it now that there have been so many copycat films featuring precious child actors with three names who whisper ominous-sounding rhetoric.  I'll admit that the ending may come as a revelation to anybody who has never seen a movie before.  ""Unbreakable""?  Clumsy and hamfisted in its plot manipulations towards a conclusion as trite and trivial as...well, as that of ""The Sixth Sense.""  So we're starting to see a pattern here.  Thus we arrive with inexorable logic at the next installment, ""Signs,"" which takes the established formula of contrived suspense and penny-plain plot twists to the next level of redundancy.

Widower Mel Gibson (get it ladies - widower - now swoon on cue), his two kids (both suffering from patently plot-driven afflictions), and his brother Joaquin Phoenix  (I have nothing sarcastic to say in parenthesis about him except that he should make better career decisions) wake up one day to find huge ""crop circles"" on the family farm.  Turns out they aren't alone - hundreds of similar patterns start popping up in fields all over the globe with such rapidity that it's impossible to ascribe the phenomenon to human hoax.  Then spaceships start appearing in the sky, and green men start popping up at kids' birthday parties.  Looks like a good old-fashioned garden variety alien invasion.

Of course, this is just the ""setup.""  Fans of this film will tell you that it's really all about the ""message,"" and this has to do with the fact that Gibson's character used to be a minister, but lost his faith after his wife's tragic death.  He's questioning the meaning of life, the validity of religion, the purpose of human existence - all in the most trite and cliched way possible, of course.  Basically, he's mad at God for killing his woman.  So God, never willing to let a sheep stray from the flock, duly sends a team of hostile aliens to almost-but-not-quite conquer the earth, purely to reaffirm Gibson's faith so that he can get started on ""The Passion.""  ""Signs,"" you see, refers not to crop circles, but to the apparently random events in our lives that can be seen by the enlightened as little messages from the Man Upstairs - such as your wife's death or the planet's invasion by extraterrestrials.

In other words, this film can't decide whether it wants to be hackneyed sci-fi or hamfisted psychodrama, so it acquiesces in alternating back and forth between the two, or trying (and failing) to make sense of one mode in terms of the other.  The ""stylistic flair"" applied by ole ""M"" to the whole proceedings only emphasizes his fundamental bankruptcy of plot or point.  If some people call this a ""great movie,"" it's only because they can't distinguish style from substance, or, for that matter, Shinola from its notorious alternative.  Personally, I'd rather re-listen to Orson Welles' ""War"" than put myself through watching this pretentious, boring piece of trash again.",1108425600,19,3620,4.888707037643208

1473316,1,B00005JL3T,"Signs is the worst science-fiction film ever made. Its alien-invasion story is so idiotic it makes Independence Day look clever. The cinematography is as dull as the plot is stupid. There must be at least an hour of closeups of Mel Gibson's slack, basset-hound face looking nervous but steadfast.

Poor Mel needn't have worried so much, because the alien invaders bent on pillaging Mel's midwestern farmhouse are so helpless they literally can't figure out how to break down a boarded-up door.

Their plan to conquer earth is simple: they plan to wipe us out by breaking and entering our humble abodes and fighting it out with us in unarmed combat.

That's right: these advanced interstellar travelers can't come up with any better way of wiping out six billion people by breaking into each and every house on the planet and attacking us with their bare hands, or paws. That's right: they don't have any weapons at all. Yes, folks, these critters can cross the galaxy, but they don't have enough sense to bring a weapon when they attack, not even a tire iron.

So when the aliens decide to make Mel's little farmhouse their first strategic objective, their battle plan is simple: a single alien skulks around the living room, totally unarmed, trying to look menacing. This makes the interstellar burglar an easy victim for Mel's little brotherJoaquin Phoenix--an ex-baseball player who's lost his batting average, just like big brother Mel has lost his faith.  defeats the alien in the farmhouse living room by getting the ol' Lousiville Slugger off the wall and hitting a home run right off the extraterrestrial's ribcage.

Oh, wait, I forgot: the bat just softens up the evil alien, knocking him to the floor where he's finished off by...a spilled glass of water. It seems these technologically advanced ETs failed to note, in their decades of recon, that 2/3s of Earth happens to be covered with water. It's a good thing Phoenix mugged the poor fool; otherwise that first alien picnic at the beach would have been a real bummer.

Signs may be a collections of dismal cliches, but it is original in at least two ways: not only are its alien invaders the first to arrive without any weapons, but they're also the first in film history to be baffled by simple wooden doors. First Mel's neighbor locks an alien scout in the pantry, where it scuffles around helplessly. Then the bigger invasion force lands, advances on Mel's farmhouse, and withdraws without managing to get in. What clever tactic has baffled them, you ask? The answer will surprise you: Mel and family have boarded up the doors.

Boarded-up doors, a baseball bat, and a spilled glass of water:  that's all it takes to foil an interstellar invasion. The really interesting question is why this movie makes its space invaders so comically helpless. Do American audience just need to imagine an enemy they could actually handle, after all the grim news out of Iraq--or are the film's director, star and millions of adoring fans just plain stupid?",1107475200,13,3009,4.861328125

Still, some pretty scary moments. When the Brazilian kids see the alien, and when the dog runs amok are very effective.

It's amazing that so many people find the ending so satisfying and ""deep"". In case you haven't seen this, Mel Gibson's character is a minister who has lost his faith because his wife was killed. But, lo and behold, it was all part of God's plan, because now Junior won't get killed by an alien because he's an asthmatic, because it was a part of God's plan, and Mel's daughter has a strange obsession with water, and, gee, coincidently enough, so do the aliens.

1473318,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is by far the most likeable, and worthwhile alien film ever made. It had more of a plot than any other movie with Aliens in it has. It sure dominates ""It came from the sky"", and beats ""The day the earth stood still"", but I have to admit, both of those were pretty good for their times. This one sort of left the aliens in the shadows until it really needed to bring them out, and reveal their true nature. Then again, that's the purpose behind M. Night Shyamalan's genius.

Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is living a pretty strange life after his wife was killed in a mysterious car accident, but it is now the present time, 6 months later. His children (Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) are under depression. His little girl, Bo, only drinking half a glass of water then saying it's contaminated. His brother of very few words (Joaquin Phoenix) tries to help by moving in with him, but maybe it's only making things worse.

The matter changes when a mysterious crop circle appears in the family corn fields. Normally you'd shake this off, but one day later, over 50 crop circles appear all over India. It seems that someone is trying to prove a point by playing this perfectly executed prank, but the problem doesn't stop there. It seems as though people are making sightings of strange creatures just barely after the events of the crop circles, and it doesn't look like they want to leave.

The acting in this one was great. The kid actors did a very good job, especially Abigail Breslin who played little Bo Hess. She's so precious. There was something about Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix that made them show their acting talents, even though it didn't seem like they were doing much, but it was great acting on everyone's part, maybe Rory Culkin just a little bit less, but he did good also. Probably runs in the famous Culkin family.

The DVD was certainly entertaining escpecially with the deleted scenes. I always like to see DVD's with special features like that. Even M. Night Shyamalans first scary movie that he ever made when he was a kid. Seriously, how many people can say they started making movies as a kid? Not many, and it's surprising to see these, and they're actually pretty funny.

What I liked about the movie the best were the aliens. You never even see them until the ending. You don't even need to see them just to know they're there, that what was what kept me watching it till the end. It truly did scare to think they might be hiding in the darkness someday. They could just as well exist. Definetelty not a movie to pass up. It's out of this world!",1107129600,3,2581,4.506410256410256
1473319,5,B00005JL3T,"I think this is my all-time favorite movie.  I honestly don't know what everyone is complaining about.  This movie is suspenseful, perfectly executed, and its' simple theme of faith and hope and the importance of family and forgiveness is beautiful.  Forget the stupid aliens who reacted so badly to water and yet decided to invade a planet made up of 3/4 water; the aliens are a mere afterthought to what the film is really about.

The real twist at the end of the film is that there isn't one!  I know I was fooled, thinking all along that it all just HAD to be a hoax, somehow, until the family left the basement.  And there were plenty of times I jumped in my seat in startelment.  We see only quick glimpses of the antagonists (the aliens) in this, but that's enough; somehow its' even more ominous because the imagination can provide far more scarier images than what can be shown on screen.  The music was also very good, the same 3 notes providing a background of tenseness and acute hyper awareness and expectation.

Most of all, though, the circle of people that was the Hess family, Graham (Mel Gibson, my favorite actor), a recently widowed Episcopalian priest who recently left his church due to a crisis of faith; Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix, my second favorite actor), a washed-up minor league baseball player in his early twenties, the younger brother of Graham (by about 18 years) who moved in with the family after the death of Graham's wife Colleen; and the two children, asthmatic Morgan and water-idiocyncratic Bo.  The level of devotion, protectiveness and caring for each family member was palpable; I could truly believe this was a real family.  And each of these people's distinctive traits wound up to all be for a reason.  The entire theme of the movie was like a sack with a drawstring tie that slowly pulled closed and tightened together until it was closed by the end of the movie, in a very satisfying, comforting manner.

The performances of each cast member was flawless, and there were some wonderful moments of humor and silliness to offset the intensity. (Both Gibson and Phoenix have demonstrated their talents for dry wit and comedy before and used it in sparing doses in this.) I think my favorite scene was the ""Last Supper"", where they all went from tears and anger and impending doom and dread to simple re-affirmation of each one's love for each other.(And they all managed to do it without getting too sappy about it.) The moment when a sobbing Graham, surrounded by his two distraught children, pulls his weeping brother Merrill into their hug was both funny and very touching and poignant.

Even the children did very well, bright and precocious without ever slipping into overly cutesy or bratty.

I liked the extra ""Making Of"" feature and especially the deleted scenes; there was one in particular I really wish that would have been kept, where Merrill tries to block the attic door from the aliens and Graham tells him the story of when he, Graham, accidentally broke Merrill's arm when Merrill was 2 1/2.

This is a movie I am able to watch multiple times without losing interest. It's well done all around with a little something of everything, and highly recommended.",1107043200,4,3216,4.7571942446043165
1473320,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors and I thought this was his scariest movie.  A lot of people would disagree with me, because Sixth Sense was so revolutionary scary.  But I found Signs to be much more plausible in terms of my own life.  Like I don't have to worry (at least I hope not) about seeing dead people.  However, crop circles and aliens, which I will also probably never encounter personally, could convievably happen in my lifetime.  The scene in the basement was particularly scary for me.

A lot of people are critical of the other theme in the movie, about faith and all that.  I thought that was mostly incidental.  I didn't personally find that it either enhanced or detracted from the movie.  It did provide a context for some of the events in the movie, though, so I think it was necessary.",1107043200,,824,4.513513513513513
1473321,3,B00005JL3T,"Basically, this film is divided between two halves:part of the film wants to be a straight-ahead 50s B-movie scare-fest, while the other half attempts to deal with the underlying themes of faith and destiny. It is this conflict between the two halves that keeps the film from being as good as it should have been. The film works well when it's in the old-fashioned scary film mode, but when it starts to tackle the big themes it occasionally becomes, quite frankly, silly. In fact, in all of Shayamalan's films, his insatiable desire to always have to include that big twist tends to be the film's undoing. He succeeded with a good twist in ""The Sixth Sense"", but since then the twists have all felt pretentious and left a bad taste-particularly so in the terrible ""Unbreakable"", which was basically a film that spent three quarters of itself just to build up to a so-so twist in the end. The Village and Signs suffer similar fates, and all three of these films feel too much as though they were written for the sake of a twist, rather than for the sake of being a good story. If Shayamalan ever gets over his pretensions and starts writing films that don't get caught caught up in getting to the twist, he just might create a five-star film.",1106352000,,1242,4.573991031390134

Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.

There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.

1473404,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan (originally: Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan) can now be held responsible for creating one of the best movies I have ever seen.

I loved every instant, of every second, of every minute of both hours of Sign's. Once I saw Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall's ""John Handcock"" in the opening credits I knew it was going to be special. (They also executive produced ""The Sixth Sense"" for Shyamalan) Not only was Sign's backed by these Spielbergian's, it was brought to us courtesy of Touchstone, Beuna Vista, and Disney - (Pretty much the Siamese Triplet's of the Production/distribution world) and the production was handled by Blinding Edge.

Watching Sign's was like an imaginitive, well-crafted trip into a familiar land with a different vision. Concerning one of the major question's most people have about Sign's. Roger Ebert says it best, ""I'm not even going to tell you whether or not there are alien's in this movie...it doesn't matter."" And I agree one hundred percent. It absolutely doesn't matter. How much will you like sign's? Depend's on the size of your imagination my friends. In this film, its what you allow your mind to see that scares you. That's what makes it so special. After the 673 million dollar success of the Sixth Sense, he could have done anything he wanted. It could have very easily been War of the Worlds. (Which Spielberg will have completed soon). Sign's is about calmness, a serene portrait about one family on one little farm. And there it stays.

Mel Gibson, who plays Episcopalian priest Graham Hess, must learn a hard lesson of faith, that there is a purpose for everything, and that there is a God. But does he learn this lesson? Or, do we get the infamous Shyamalan twist at the end, and the last thing that we expect happens? Guess you'll have to see. Just keep your eyes open. Shyamalan's writing style has grown to it's magnitude. He's gotten plenty of practice while writing Unbreakable, Stuart Little, The Sixth Sense, Wide Awake and Praying With Anger. One of his favorite directors is Hitchcock, who is probably doing giddy summersaults in his grave right now. You can bet Shyamalan is the Hitchcock of our time. He has lassoed: Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, Wide Awake, and Praying With Anger. (You can see his childhood works on the dvd's. A guilty pleasure he had to do.)

Like hitchcock he likes to be on screen in his movies a bit. He can be seen in Unbreakable (Stadium Drug Dealer), The Sixth Sense (Dr. Hill), Praying With Anger (Dev Raman). (He also produced Unbreakable and Praying with anger.) It is recorded that Shyamalan's biggest fear, is being average. He is far above average in my book. Sign's is set in the quiet farming community (thus the crop circles) in Buck County, Pennsylvania. It a great setting that is rural enough to feel creepy and at the same time (with the family) a home that feels safe. I was so glad to see Joaquin Pheonix, who is currently my favorite actor. (River Pheonix's brother) (can be seen in Gladiator, and 8MM...thats Eight Millimeter, for the unknowing folks. And at his best in ""Quill's"". Also, he is astounding in Ladder 49, on dvd in March.) He has a heart felt, loving role as an uncle who cares for his family and is dealing with his past. An excellent choice as Mel's brother.

There are two young stars that are for sure to have awesome futures, if they keep this trend up: Rory Culkin and Abby {Abbigail} Breslin. I only have one one word for these kids - WOW. Yes he is Macauley's Brother, and hopefully he will stick around longer. These kids are natural's.

Sign's now lays to rest on DVD FOR anyone to own. The picture and sound qualities are near perfect, and the extra's are sufficient for the release. In its Theatrical run, Sign's knocked it out of the park with a 408 Million dollar run. I couldn't think of a more deserving film.

After Thousands of movies, and seven years of reviewing, I have a favorite. ~SAOS~",1105488000,3,3940,4.701449275362319
1473405,4,B00005JL3T,"In his 2 films before ""Signs"", M. Night Shyalaman created a ghost story that ultimately wasn't about the ghosts, and a superhero movie that wasn't about super powers.  In ""Signs"", Shyamalan delivers an alien movie that's, in a sense, not about aliens.  Shyamalan's storytelling techniques are brilliant, something not lost on even those ultimately left cold by the actual story.  Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix turn in solid performances, and the 2 kids are excellent in fairly demanding roles.  ""Signs"" reminds me of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode - in fact Shyamalan's storytelling techniques owe more to Rod Serling than they do to Spielberg or even Hitchcock.  Like Serling, Shyamalan weaves a suspenseful and baffling story, and asks us to ""suspend disbelief"" (as well as overlook some plotholes) and just go along with the ride, promising there's a point worth reaching at the end.  ""Signs"" delivers on this promise, using a science fiction story to once again make a statement about self-discovery and redemption. (At the risk of seeming preachy, I appreciate the fact that the redemption in this case has a religious dimension - a somewhat gutsy move on Shyamalan's part). ""Signs"" has more plot holes than Shyamalan's previous 2 films, but overall it's another solid film from Shyamalan.",1104537600,2,1290,5.148325358851674
1473406,5,B00005JL3T,"There are certain movies that are creepy beyond belief, but Signs still falls into my ""bedtime movie"" category from the overall feeling of comfort it somehow gives me, in spite of the shivers it produces.  To me, I found it an excellent presentation of Ying and Yang, the balance of life, that for everything there is a purpose; even the most horrid of life's tragedies could be a sign of better things to come.

This is a beautiful story of family love and everyday life interrupted first by a tragedy, and then by an extremely creepy alien invasion.  The low-keyed small town lives of the people the movie centers around, make the actual eeriness of the movie even more palpable.  No overt terror and no gore at all, `Signs' is still a scary movie in that it invades your own imagination with subtle shadows and innuendos that do not strike out at you with clammy arms, but sneak up with deadly stealth.

The premise is that a crop farmer and former Priest finds `crop circles' out in his corn field.  Then the news channels begin reporting on these incidents occurring on a global level, and sightings of alien spacecraft hovering over Mexico City, along with footage of a bizarre intruder at a birthday party in Brazil.  The veiled suspense builds as people realize that the threat is real, while they try to figure out why these aliens are here on Earth.  The most overt horror comes from Rev. Hess's flashbacks to Officer Paski's explanation of his wife's condition at the scene of a previous accident.  Sent shudders down my spine, it did.

My hat comes off in a bowing sweep to some absolutely stellar performances from some remarkable actors in this film.  Aside from Mel Gibson as Rev. Graham Hess, there is young Rory Culkin playing Morgan Hess, whose acting abilities are equal to or above those of his old brother McCauley Culkin.  The little girl Abigail Breslin playing Bo Hess is adorable and perfect in every way, and take particular note of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Merrill Hess (believe it or not, he played the kid Gary in Steve Martin's Parenthood!).  He has turned into a notable actor and quite a hottie as well.  Merrill's bravery in part of the ending is so overwhemling that it makes the character (and actor) extremely attractive.  Officer Paski is played by the extremely talented Cherry Jones (Erin Brockovich) and the part of Veterinarian Ray Reddy was played by none other than M. Night Shyamalan, the director of `Signs'.  Even the bit parts of Lionel Prichard (Michael Showalter) and Tracy Abernathy (Merritt Wever) are noteworthy performances.

Overall, this is a superbly acted movie, with a stealthy creepiness that will grow on you rather than slap your face, and a story of humanity at its very finest.

For one I didn't like the needless animal violence in the very beginning. Getting past that, there wasn't enough content in the movie. Yes, there were eerie moments when there were unexplained noises, and things started happening with the aliens.

1473523,4,B00005JL3T,"The success of ""The Sixth Sense"" had an impact on M. Night Shyamalan's subsequent work.  Shyamalan feels that he has to hit a homerun everytime he steps to the plate.  Unlike Merrill(Joaquin Phoenix) in ""Signs"", he doesn't strikeout but he hits singles and doubles.  First to the films positives.  Mel Gibson delivers one of his better performances as the father/farmer and former preacher whose faith has lapsed after the tragic death of his wife.  The children in the film (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) give natural unaffected performances.  Shyamalan establishes an eerie mood throughout the film, something of a homage to his idols Hitchcock and Spielberg but tempered by his own unique sensibility.  Even the opening credits, with a Bernard Hermann inspired music track, portend something Hitchcock-like.  To the film's detriment, the film barely recovers from certain plot holes and implausibilities, if you consider alien invasion as plausible.  That said, the strengths here outweigh it's weaknesses.  With this film and the recently released ""The Village"", Shyamalan has effectively straight-jacketed himself to a certain genre and audience expectations.  As a word of advice, Shyamalan should really start exploring other genres to work in.  Shyamalan is one of our great talents and like Spielberg, who also experienced early commercial success, he can only get better.",1100131200,2,1381,5.462264150943396

It's a wonderful story of humanity and the aliens are really a back drop to the real plot, which is human emotion and what we go through in certain situations. All of Night's four BIG movies so far have been about this. They are wonderful stories of love, faith and devotion.
What bothers me is that the Vista Series has included a DTS 5.1 audio track on both the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable ""Vista Series"" releases. You are missing out on 50% of the reason to buy DVDs if you do not have a home theatre system as the audio is just as important as the video. The sound on The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable when listening to the DTS 5.1 track is truly remarkable. The sound reproduction is flawless and the surround mix is just divine.
I was so looking forward to Signs being released when I noticed it was a ""Vista Series"" release. Whislt it was great to watch the movie again and also great to hear it at home in 5.1 Dolby Digital, I was seriously disappointed to note that the DTS 5.1 track had not been included.

Everything that we, or the characters, learn about the aliens' motives is self-referrals: the hyperbolic commentary on TV, the speculation of friends, foes and family, the fear of the aliens around the world.  These responses seem unwarranted by the aliens' behavior that is directly shown.  Some are patently hysterical -- TV reports the saucers in South America are now invisible -- as evidenced by the discovery of a dead bird!

The alien behavior that we actually witness seems exclusively focused on attempting to communicate with hysterical humans.  When Hess and his family emerge from the cellar, the aliens have carved the simple shapes from Morgan's bedspread into the wall.  They seem to be trying to communicate with us -- abandoning their own complex symbols for our simple ones.

The only creature that the audience has (off screen) evidence that the aliens harmed is one of the dogs, and Mel Gibson's son killed the other earlier defending his sister.  Might not the aliens have been doing the same?

Father Hess's loss of faith has brought him, and those he loves pain. He's miserable, and highly motivated to find ""meaning"" in what has happened to him. Even in the climatic scene, when Hess sees the alien ""poison"" his son, there is no direct evidence that the alien intended that.  Hess got that from TV too.  Since we find out about the child's asthma attack, the alien might even have been giving him the ""breath of life.""

The appearance of crop circles, and half-seen forms roving in and out of the farm's cornfields, confirm his lack of faith, until the final scenes of the film when he comes to realize that there are no coincidences.

It never ceases to amaze me just how many people watched this film, and totally didn't get the message. I am the LAST person in the world to espouse feel-good Christian ideology, being about as Christian as Osama Bin Laden on a bad hair day and about as Orthodox in my approach to Spirituality as GW Bush is in his approach to Truth. Regardless, whether you agree with the ideology or not, the message is delivered in a profound and thought provoking way. One of the best points in the film is when Gibson, the ex-cleric, and Phoenix, the ex-baseball pro, are discussing the ""End of the World"". It sums up the entire message of the film:

""People break down into two groups when the experience something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance. I'm sure the people in Group number two are looking at those fourteen lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation isn't fifty-fifty. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. But there's a whole lot of people in the Group number one. When they see those fourteen lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?""

As Spiritual as I considered myself to be, I realized that I fall into Group number two, and, considering the ramifications of it, I have to confess I wasn't too comfortable with it.

So, why the ""ridiculous aliens that dissolve in water""? Did anyone count how many films with demons in them (or the title) came out in 2002? If Shyamalan had called these invaders demons, the message of the film would have been lost. He wants you to work for it a bit. Clearly, in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic theology, only God can fight demons. By obscuring their origins, or making it irrelevant, the message comes clearer. It's a parable of faith, and if demons existed, well, there had to be a God, as well, didn't there? Therefore having faith is a foregone conclusion in the circumstances. By making the villains less theological, but no less otherworldly, Shyamalan makes the question of faith under the circumstances less clear cut, but also more profound once it is made.

I'm one of those folks who likes to watch movies that make me think. It doesn't matter whether the message is one I agree with. In fact, messages I haven't agreed with tend to be more interesting, since considering them expands my point of view. Shyamalan has taken a deep, profound and, frankly, terrifying message and wrapped it in a candy-coating, then in colorful cellophane. Regardless, if you take your time and get to the ""chewy middle"" of this one, you will find the message no less powerful than that of the Exorcist, though perhaps wholly more positive in note.",1097712000,2,3911,4.62158273381295

I was immediately engrossed by Shyamalan's story and enraptured by its execution.  The production is a masterful exhibition of using the outdoors and indoors and making each seem open and inviting or intensely claustrophobic, dependent upon plot revelations.

Mel Gibson has never been better.  Ever.

Joaquin Phoenix is without doubt the finest American actor of his generation, and his role here is perfectly realized, brilliantly nuanced and touchingly delivered.

The children were beautifully directed and give natural, effective performances.

The story's evolution is one of revelation.  Everything is not obvious all at once, and each character's personality is revealed, layer by layer, until the storyline -- alien invasion -- forces each to face his fears and brings the family together in the face of adversity.

I am in awe of M. Night Shyamalan's gifts as a storyteller and director.  He is clearly -- HANDS DOWN -- the successor to Alfred Hitchcock in delivering unusual stories with stylistic flair and unexpected plot twists.

The music underscore, by Shyamalan's composer of choice James Newton Howard, is beautifully evocative and chillingly appropriate throughout the film.

1473629,4,B00005JL3T,"I loved this movie.  As for it living up to its director's previous successes, I would rather rate this movie on its own merits.  The suspence, I thought, was masterful.  It lured us without gore, in fact, we only see the aliens twice briefly--no special effects overload.  Instead, we hear them, imagine them, can only speculate about them.  Nicely done.

I also liked the subplot of Mel's wife's accident and how it led to an examination of faith.  For days I asked myself whether I was a person who saw signs and believed they were miracles belonging to a divine plan, or whether they were pure coincidences or scientifically explained.  It was a masterful marrying of the two plot lines.

But surprisingly, the thing I liked most about this movie was the chemistry between the characters--again masterful acting.  The family was believable.  The relationship between the two brothers endearing and really humorous at times.  As a viewer we really come to care about these people--the true test of any successful character acting.

1473631,2,B00005JL3T,"Has anyone seen the ""real"" M. Night Shyamalan lately? The genius who was responsible for The Sixth Sense? Where has he wandered and will he ever return to the writing and directing form we know so well? As King Monghut (Yul Brynner) in The King and I would have said, ""is a mystery"" that I am loathe to solve.

This reviewer has come away from his latest creation, Signs, and is wondering just what Mr. Shyamalan had on his mind as he envisioned and wrote it. He has produced, for all intents and purposes, two totally different sets of subject matter that are bucking the yoke that tries mightily to bind them, and the results are uneven and forced.

Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, who until six months ago, was an ordained minister, married and the father of a young son and daughter. Tragically, his entire world is turned upside down when a young man (M. Night Shyamalan) falls asleep at the wheel of his car one night and crashes into a truck. The unlikely victim in this collision was not either driver, but Hess's wife, Colleen (Patricia Kalember) who had been taking a walk down the dark country road before dinner and is caught between the two vehicles, ""pinned."" We are shown throughout the film, at emotional times of trouble, flashbacks of that terrible night and the repercussions that resulted. As a result of this accident, Hess leaves the constrictions of his vocation and questions his faith with unceasing volatility, until a series of crop ""signs"" are discovered on his property.

His young brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), has moved in with the family to help keep the farm, hearth and kin afloat as it is ferried down the River Styx and to the open arms of aliens who will make up the ""second"" story of this film. Merrill had a promising career as a minor league baseball player, but had the unfortunate habit of hitting every ball with such force and abandon that he literally played himself out a job and into the record books as possessing, among other things, the record for most strikeouts. As a result, he has never realized his full potential and is now employed at a gas station.

Morgan and Bo Hess (played respectively by Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin) are strange, out of sort children. Morgan has the ""tic"" of always assuming that there is a problem with any water that she drinks and as a result, the house is littered with glass upon glass that will present an encouraging turn of events as the film progresses (think of visions of The Wizard of Oz). Bo, as played by the younger brother of Macauley Culkin, is that child actor, ""flavour of the month"" that seems to permeate films today. He is old beyond his years and possesses the wisdom of the ages, or so we would be led to believe. His Achilles Heel is to suffer from asthma, and that too, will play a prominent part in the film.

What is puzzling about this film is that Shyamalan can't make up his mind precisely what he wants to present to the viewer. Is it a story about feeling that God has abandoned a true believer in his hour of true need, or, is this a story about aliens and the wrath that they want to incur? Either story could have been built upon, but as separate units; rather like a ""two for two"" sale. Is the audience supposed to be mesmerized by a story that seems to borrow occasionally from George Pal's 1953 classic, The War of the Worlds or be stupefied by the desertion of Hess from his faith? It's extremely hard to fathom just how this family, this dysfunctional foursome, manage to hold it all together in the face of the alien invasion. Phoenix's one display of true emotion was garnered when he watched a news report on television of a birthday party video from Brazil on national news, that showed an alien in all his consummate and unwelcome glory. The senior Hess's make the decision to barricade themselves in their home and while this is fine and reasonable up to a point, at what juncture were they supposed to question their supplies, food, escape routes, or most importantly, making real contact with others in their community? Gibson does make an unexpected visit to Ray Reddy (Shyamalan), after receiving an aborted call, and discovers that while Reddy is ""ready"" to leave the area, he has left a ""caller"" locked in the kitchen pantry for Gibson to investigate, as we know he will. What is so incredible in this story, though, is the suggestion presented that the aliens, with all their technological wizardry, are susceptible to a very common thing here on Earth (a la ""The War of the Worlds). One wonders if H. G. Wells (author of The War of the Worlds) were alive today, along with Barre Lyndon (writer for the film of the same name), could they sue for infringement?

The special effects of Signs are of the maniacal, crazed and evil variety - translation: the aliens. They are a decided change from the charmers of Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind who sought to be our friends. As in The War of the Worlds, Shymalan's are up to no good. Verbalizations by his aliens are akin to those as displayed in John McTiernan's 1987 film Predator, and are of the clicking variety (another liberal ""borrowing""), and their body makeup is as we have always taught it would be - green, but these visitors are NOT little.

The one saving grace for Signs is the musical score by James Newton Howard. The four opening notes of the film reminded this reviewer of the opening notes from ""Danse Macbre"" by Saint Saens, and just as eerie. Howard has been in tandem with Shyamalan's films since the inception of The Sixth Sense and parlayed his success to Unbreakable and now Signs. It puts one in mind of the long association that Bernard Herrmann had with Alfred Hitchcock and one wonders if Howard will continue in the same vein as his esteemed colleague. Howard's score is ripe with characterizations and his three note motif is played with a variety of success throughout. Of course, some adoption has also come via Herrmann's most famous score for Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" with piercing violins, and while this is not totally a bad thing in and of itself, it cheapens an otherwise fantastic rendering by him.

Shyamalan is missing in action, searching for that previous success that made his film The Sixth Sense, a household name and the sentence, ""I see dead people"" a catch phrase that still reverberates to this day. ""There's a monster outside my bedroom door. Can I have a glass of water?"", uttered by Bo, simply doesn't convey the same spine tingling scariness as that uttered by Haley Joel Osment. Perhaps Shyamalan needs to back away from the business of horror for a while and concentrate all of his energies on building a story that truly draws his audience into another world. Signs is a bastardized pretender to the throne and as Shakespeare would have said, it's ""much ado about nothing.""",1092441600,3,6835,4.64297520661157

In fact i hated it. It was just a jumpled mass of stuff was my first opinion. Signs just seemed boring to me. Recently we watched it again and i now think it is different then unbreakable but it truly deserves 5 stars.  the acting is first rate. Gibson is excellent as the almost failed preacher, Pheonix shows what an excellent and IMHO totally underrated actor he is.. I normally hate kids in films like these and on one or two occasions (e.g. Jurassic Park) was actually up for the bad guys to end the horror of them.  These kids are different. They can act and they are extremely funny. In fact there is an incredible amount of humour in this film but is not overbearing. The scene where the child is explaing to gibson about extraterestrials and say the author is perscuted for his beliefs and gibson replies in classic deadpan 'oh, so he is unemployed...' Classic acting, classic direction.. Also the scene where gibson returns home to find his 2 children and pheonix sitting with tin foil hats is priceless...

the story is not your usual sci fi. it deals with what would you do if things did start appearing in the sky (not what the US Marines would do but you and me) and that is its power.  THis is  particularly tragic as it shows a  family that has been devastated already and is verging on completely imploding.

if you are looking, a big screen shoot em up, this isn't it. you need to be in a better frame of mind. but if you want a good night in, and a good well paced, taut, well acted film and well directed, that stretches the mind just a small amount...this is the one for you. The question to be asked at the end is still the same...are you one that see signs in everything, or is it just chance?  you decide. there is no answer here...you have to decide.

1473634,1,B00005JL3T,"Grossly disappointing.

I was looking forward to this M. Night film thinking I would get an intelligent treatise on the crop circle phenomenon/Sci-Fi flick. No such luck. What I got was a  maudlin, slow story about a 50'ish minister who becomes angry with God for taking his wife in an car accident.

As a minister, does this man think that he would be exempt from life's inherent dangers and possible tragedies?

The silly plot is laughable as drama, but as  sci-fi it has so many holes that it's ridiculous.

Aliens averse to water travel to the water planet, they are strong and fast enough to leap to roof tops, yet are incapable of avoiding a guy swinging a baseball bat. A wooden door is an impenetrable barrier for them.

Why would they simply not be gunned down by police/military or by firemen with hoses?

The point of the crop circles was navigation. They can travel interstellar space, but need crop circles to mark local locations.

I don't mind suspending believability for a good yarn, but this poorly thought out excuse for a B movie borders on the absurd. The Hitchcock imitations are everywhere, and yes, after the tenth close up of a glass of water we get it, water is somehow significant!

Pretty much just an unbelievable and smarmy drama about one man's spiritual crisis with a weak and unresolved ending.

Night taking on the role of a lesser character in the movie. (Unfortunately, his acting is not quite up to par with Hitchcock's - Shyalaman ends up looking like an arrogant director with a large-headed nod to himself. He also disengages the viewer from the movie due to his bad acting next to Mel Gibson.)

 In the bonus features, at least he fesses up to the ""older style"" of moviemaking and recognizes ""The Birds"" as well as ""Night of the Living Dead"" as influential to the making of ""Signs."" You can't deny the refreshing aspects he brings to the screen: a lingering camera, silence as a suspense tool rather than an over-dramatic score, no romantic pursuit involved, and Joquain Phoenix as a nice (even funny) guy.

 I'll save the 5-paragraph movie summary for another time, and skip to the good stuff: aliens. Well, they're bad guys in this movie, but Shyalaman's combination of classic filmmaking with computerized imaging and blue-screen effects really end up hindering each other. You could compare the suspense he creates by NOT seeing the aliens to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but when the first alien is seen in ""Signs,"" on a television newscast, it is both strange and...not real. Maybe the problem was that I was expecting a flock of killer birds to peck their way through the boards that were nailed to the windows, but at least those looked real (and many were real). Unfortunately, I don't have the answer to a real-looking alien (most of us don't), but it just seems a bit out of place in the style of the movie.

Night Shyamalan is technically proficient in creating alien spookiness and so forth, but when combined with the dramatic angle of the movie the script becomes laughable. Mel Gibson's faith is restored because his kid is saved from the aliens because he has asthma and his wife told him to ""swing away"". The aforementioned part about the swing away line was just hilarious and caused the movie to lose any seriousness it had. I mean his brother takes a baseball bat and starts hitting the aliens because Gibson's dead wife told him to swing away, and this is suppose to be a big dramatic revelation. I was at the point of tears laughing. I really couldn't believe it, it was as if Shyamalan was in roundabout way trying to make fun of faith by putting parts in the movie that were simply absurd. Like Shyamalan's other movies it seems he is more concerned with a niffy shock ending, wether it compliments the movie or not.

 The movie was not all bad though simply because it was hilarious. My fav scene had to be the part were the kids won't eat their food and so Mel Gibson stuffs all the food in his mouth and he goes ""Ill eat all the food""

 To me Shyamalan movies seem to lack an emotional core even though he earnestly tries to create this in his films. He can never simply imply things he has to take a heavy handed aproach. Gibson faith couldn't be restored simply by surviving a harrowing situation, it had to be stated direct by action and dialogue. Every action has to have a direct cause and effect in his movies. Gibson looses his faith due to the car crash, he regains faith because son is saved by having asthma. The ending scene is also very heavy handed showing Mel once again in his priest robes, as if the viewer was too stupid to come to the conclusion that he had regained his faith.

(Guys who are leads in movies like Mad Max and Braveheart should not be cast as emotional and undecided person that is afraid to wield a kitchen knife.)

1473778,3,B00005JL3T,"The movie offers some chilling psychological scares and excellent photography; but the buildup of the whole story appears to almost too manipulatively purposefully orbit around the twist. Many say the movie feels like an extended Twilight Zone episode, and I would not fervently disagree.

The main theme of the movie deals with faith. Most reviewers say the movie focuses on the VALUE of faith: keeping faith pays, as is the case in the movies climatic encounter between Mel Gibsons character and the alien. But whether or not its the filmmakers intention, I feel the movie is actually more about the MEANING of faith.

Warning: plot spoiler follows.

To me, its amazing how Mel Gibsons character could relate the means to defeat the alien to what her wife had told him before she died. The way he did it is reminiscent of how some people (quite ridiculously) claim that the novel Moby Dick could predict human history. Many try to interpret the happening of what appears to be just an ordinary event easily explainable by plain common sense (or due to pure coincidence) as a profound prediction of the supposed prophets. Such practice borders on superstition. But contemporarily people prefer to call it faith.

Theres of course another, much more meaningful, form of faith, which is about resilience and preservation. However, the faith emphasized in the movie belongs to the first kind.

The message I get from the movie is that faith is deeply planted in the mind of a person. He might from time to time consciously question the intensity of his faith (just like Mel Gibsons character does in most of the movie). But during times of crisis (the alien encounter), his faith will always surface again and dictate how this person interprets whats happening around him (like how Mel Gibsons character interprets the alien encounter as pre-arranged and as predicted by his wife). A faithful person would go a great length to contrive a perception of significant meanings underlying an event (like how Mel Gibsons character relates how he defeats the alien to the words mumbled by his dying wife in a rather far-fetched manner.) In this sense, to me, the movie speaks against faith, highlighting how tyrannical it could be and how it could distort a persons perspectives.

Im not sure what message the director really wants to bring across. But if its the directors intention to use the final twist to show how the movies characters benefit from keeping faith, I would feel the movie is too judgmental and the twist too abrupt and blunt. Also, in that case, the director would be just a real-life example of Mel Gibsons character: Contriving to give the movie (an event) some meaning that he stubbornly believes is central to movie-making (life). Here, the meaning in question is the audiences surprise by the final twist. But when you walk out of the theatre, you might not be able to suppress your own silent protest against the movie: a good movie should ultimately not only be about a twist. Building everything, however grandly and meticulously, around it feels like one devoting the whole life preparing his own burial ceremony.

M. Night Shyamalan's third film makes me wonder: all those people who watched Unbreakable and trashed it, then watched Signs and loved it... what exactly were they smoking at the time?

Signs is everything Unbreakable was not: boring, badly-paced, lacking in tension. The only good thing about the movie (and to be fair, it was a very good thing) was the acting by all the principals. Mel Gibson, while not acting with the intensity here that he gave in Braveheart, Payback, or even Chicken Run, turns in a good performance, while both Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin give the performances of their careers. Unfortunately, however, it's not enough to give the movie the power it needs to get from jump-in-your-chair scene to jump-in-your-chair scene; there's just not enough going on in the interim. It seems like Shyamalan wanted to get the tense atmosphere going all the way through, rather than try for something else when it wasn't being a horror film (in the way Audition is a romantic comedy, say, or Cure is a murder mystery), and it simply doesn't work.

Worth seeing if you just like watching the princpals act. But if you're looking to be scared, if you're looking for tension, or if you're looking for anything other than boredom, you're better off hunting down something that can actually pull it off. **",1090800000,4,1350,4.860869565217391

The film was moderately entertaining but missed a chance to be great because apparently nobody said, Hey Night, how about fixing this and that before we start production? I wanted to love the movie, and had no problem with the story turning out to be more drama than sci fi (although I like sci fi a lot and expected more). But the flaws in the story were distracting. How come the reverend lost his faith over one incident, his wife's death? His whole foundation was shaken by one innocent accident -- it wasn't like she was kidnapped, tortured, raped without a chance to say goodbye. As a non-cleric, moderately religious person who has lost loved ones, I don't think it's that simple to shake somebody's faith so I couldn't really see it as anything but a plot device. And if you're going to stick aliens into a family drama, at least have it make sense. How come the aliens spent all that time plotting an invasian and didn't figure out that millions of people have garden hoses to use against them? Why didn't they at least wipe out our water infrastructure first? And why did they stop attacking in just 12 hours? Did it suddenly hit them that duhh - there are 5 billion people on earth to knock off, one by one (since they didn't use weapons of mass destruction). What had they intended to achieve?

That backstory was much weaker, too much on the nose, than the family characters' backstory (provided mostly during the family's one trip to town). BTW, because I expected the story to be scary, since I was watching it at night in a dim living room in a house situated way out in a rural area, I had a friend watch it with me. No need. The few scary moments were easily endured. Perhaps it was scarier in the theater??? The humorous bits were nice, could have used more of those to compensate for the dramatic weaknesses.

1473842,5,B00005JL3T,"There are over 1000 reviews and it's a pretty even split, 500 think it's a masterpiece and 500 think it totally sucks. Which will you be, hard to say, but that's oddly the whole point. Signs is open to interpretation, as either a masterpiece or a total flop, and the title SIGNS is about things we interpret. My wife sees signs everywhere, there's a rainbow and she tells me it is a good omen, it's her interpretation of what she sees.

Mel Gibson plays a Preacher and Religious people interpret things as having a deeper and greaeter meaning.

And that's what SIGNS is, a movie about four people and one in particular who interprets his reality in certain ways.

When the media suggests aliens are arriving on Earth we barely see them, but our main characters interpret this as a terrifying invasion of War of the Worlds proportions. Ironically, it turns out the aliens are a pretty useless lot who can be defeated quite easily. At the same time as our four main characters are percieving a nightmare from outer space, we learn the Preacher has changed his belief system, he lost his faith when his wife was taken from him in a car accident. In the finale, the Preacher concocts a rather outrageous set of unlikely interpretations of events, and uses his wild beleifs to save his family from the aliens. It's quirky and oddball and done with a mix of tension and humor, but ultimately the movie SIGNS is about how people interpret reality and give meaning to it which may or may not be there. Does this movie mean something? Some say it's just a bad film. Others attribute deep meaning to it. I say that's what the director wanted, it's the same as the way we do or do not see signs in life, its our choice to see meaning in events. The Preacher decides to see meanings in all kinds of things at the end, at it's quite preposterous really, but however absurd his interpretations may be, his faith helps him. I think the film Signs is saying that faith in God, or seeing signs or any kind of faith, may seem nutty and irrational and a far fetched way of interpreting events, but faith in itself helps human beings to cope with problems and to survive. This is not what you expect, it is simply a little film about characters.

Personally, I liked it, but that's because of how I interpreted it. You may hate it, it's up to you what you see in the film!",1090627200,,2352,4.4375
1473843,5,B00005JL3T,"I'm amazed at how many people were disappointed with this film on discovering that it involves no explosions, fancy special effects, or fighter jets with big guns shooting down alien spacecraft. Honestly, is that what our culture is coming to? Do we NEED those things to be entertained? Based on many of these reviews of 3 stars or less, I'd say so.

 It seems that people haven't figured out yet that in Shyamalan's movies aren't about the supernatural, or in this case the extraterrestrial, so much as they are about what it is in these things that brings out the humanity in us. The fact that most of the tension generated in this movie is from a force that we hardly ever see but in grainy shots on a television proves that fear and vulnerability are not things that come from without, but from within. It takes a very perceptive and daring filmmaker to set aside the obvious, brazenly Hollywood action-fest that so many people expect when they think of alien movies in order to bring out the truth and humility in such a story. When faced with certain disaster, how many of us would go out there and pick up the first lazer blaster or fighter jet we could find and save the world single-handedly? And how many of us, believing it could be our last night on earth, would board ourselves up in our homes, eating our favorite comfort foods, grasping on to the last happy memories we have in a futile effort to ease the fear of death inside of us? Shyamalan knows that most of us in the real world would do the latter.

 Furthermore, ""Signs"" is a story about a man struggling with his faith. It is about knowing that we are not alone (and that has nothing to do with aliens. . .). The ""Signs"" in this movie aren't so much the crop signs we see in the previews, but the moments and aspects of our daily lives that ultimately bring us to some greater conclusion. THAT is what this movie is about. Not aliens.

 So, with that said, I'd like to thank Mr. Shyamalan for this film and for restoring real humanity to a genre (and, more generally, a medium) that has become increasingly artificial. . . and smack everyone who is so desensitized by that artificiality that they are no longer able to see beyond the delusory violence and egocentricity of contemporary cinema.",1090540800,6,2266,4.5012165450121655

You could have the same story of a minister losing his faith anywhere and I would still love it, but the alien invasion does gives the story extra zing.",1089936000,5,651,4.3884297520661155

1473849,3,B00005JL3T,"Actually i enjoyed this movie a little more than the other two. As his previous creations, he takes a very interesting topic (that can attract people at the movies) and builts ontop of it. He tries to pass the audience some interesting messages about family bonds and valious together with some religious point of view. Thats ok with me but i have a whole lot of things to say to him about the progress of the story.
First of all i fill a bit betrayed (as i definetelly felt with his other two movies)as a sci-fi fanatic that i am. When you here about aliens that marking the crops in order to direct their race in a full scale invasion what do you have in mind? I bet you think of a mix of ""War of the wars"" and ""ID4"" with a twist of ""Earth vs The Flying saucers"". BE WARN...what you are going to see in this movie IS NOT anything of the kind. What you don't see here is a massive U.F.O. attack at the major capitals fighting with the world's army forces for the domination of the planet. What you DO see is some simple CGI crop marks, a family with many personal issues, some light bulps on the tv(the alien spacecrafts), and a guy dressed in a well tailored alien costume. Really thats all you going to see. What you are going to here is different and in my opinion saves the day for the well known director. PERFECT soundtrack and sound effects. If you own anything close to a respectable home cinema just through in the DVD copy of the movie and have a ball.
I think its a shame that a talented artist like the director of this movie has a pathological despice of visual effects. I bet he thinks that he gives more gravity and quality in his movies if he succeeds to finish them using at the least technical visual support, but thats exactly where he is wrong. The script thats written only to serve this purpose is at least hallarious.....A little kid picking up encrypted alien communications with a little toy receiver? A priest that confrunds an seven feet alien with a kitchen knife? Aliens with invisible spaceships that cant open doors? or visiting children birthday parties? Come on M.Night you have to admit it sounds a bit lame don't you think?
Anyways as i said before mr. Shyamalan made a bit of a progress in my opinion. First of all he replaced Mr. no talent and excuse of an actor Bruce Willis with the gifted and more enjoyable Mel Gibson. I have to admitt that all of the actors performed nicely in this film(except himself). As i also pointed earlier the movie generally sounds excellent) and the topic is very interesting. The whole movie (without the use of f\x tricks) is embuted with a sense of mystery aura which definetly keeps you on guard.
And thats about it. Everything else is pure garbage. The script is childish, and the flashbacks of Mel tend to be boring and annoying at some point. The goofs of the story are numerous and Shymalan as an actor is proposed from me for the Gold Blackberry.(Sorry M.N. but there is no Bruse Willis in this one). However for the people who haven't already seen this one is strongly recommended, but for two hours of really good fun prefer to watch this in a home theatre.
Ah, and a suggestion to M. Night. Next time you want to analyse the seriousity of family bonds and the everlasting matters of relegious faith don't do it with an alien invasion. You'll end up degrading the subject as you did in this flick.",1088380800,2,3378,4.415064102564102

1473949,4,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"") has earned a reputation quickly as one of the hottest new suspense directors. On his third film, he tells the story of a faithless preacher whose family is being haunted by ominous unexplained crop circles at their Pennsylvabia farmhouse. Shylaman takes a different approach with his ""alien invasion"" story. Rather than relying on expensive production and elaborate special effects, he takes a creative approach and shows as little of the actual invaders as possible. Instead, he builds the film around the farmhouse's clostrophobic settings and allows the actors to tell the story rather than some overproduced CGI effects. Mel Gibson's portrayal of a man who has lost touch with his faith is a nice change of pace. This one might be too character-based to appeal to those looking for the same kind of science fiction roller coaster ride that they got with ""Independence Day"" but it's obvious that Shyamalan was never trying to make a popcorn movie. While the film does lack logic in some areas, it's probably one of the better films to come along in the genre in some time.",1088035200,,1129,4.978835978835979

Mel must have wandering around in the wheat fields for too long when he signed on.  M. Night (one of the coolest names in the world, I must admit) really hoodwinked Mel to do this picture.
The film is suspenseful until the aliens show their faces.  My mouth literally fell open.  They look just like B-Movie rejects, some dude in a Gumby costume.  These aliens come across light years and then get stuck in a pantry.  Mmm, donuts . . . must be what lured them in.  And I won't spoil the end, but you would THINK the aliens would have done some research on the atmospheric conditions of Earth before they decided to arrive and take over.  One of the worst movie resolutions I have seen.

Mel Gibson is superb as the former Father trying to hold on to his family even after his heart has been ripped out.  After playing emotionally raw characters from LETHAL WEAPON to HAMLET, he proves he can also nail a devastated, lifeless man overwhelmed by loss.
The extras were very interesting: in the Making Of documentary, it shows how the film commenced shooting on September 11th, 2001 and the director shares his feelings about that and the loss of a family member later in the filming.

1473953,3,B00005JL3T,"I looked at this film as a dream sequence (or, more appropriately a nightmare). The aliens represented Mel Gibson's inner demons, the invasion of earth standing for his loss of faith in life and the world after the senseless death of his wife. The movie, therefore, is one man's subconscious attempt to find meaning in a world that's seemingly gone mad.
That's about the only way that I could look at this mess and not frown at it. Otherwise, the plot seems too simplistic, the aliens too hokey (and kind of dumb, for that matter), and the script has a few too many clumsily written passages for its own good.
But M. Night Shyamalan's bad movies are still better than many directors' good ones. Signs is rife with tension, owns a few startling moments, and there's also some good moments of lunatic comic relief. And Gibson gives a fine performance as the confused, hopeless reverend who says he's all on his own, but it looking for any sort of sign or reason to believe otherwise.",1085356800,2,981,4.611428571428571

One of the scariest scenes was at the kid's birthday party, when the alien goes across an alley unexpectedly, and of course the end was scary as hell when u see the alien threw the TV holding the boy.

I do know that it was not as exciting or thrilling as most of his movies.  It needed a little bit more of a punch or depth to it.  It was okay, but did not leave a lasting impression on me as most of his movies have done.

By the way did you guys know that Shyamalan uses the old Hitchcock adage that ""what you don't see is scarier""? Well, he does! In fact you ""don't see"" so much that I was scared out of my tiny little mind! Show more, Shyamalan, I'm freaking out!
I guess the scariest thing about these aliens is that they are so brave. See, they're allergic to water, but they traveled to a planet where over 70% of it is covered in water. Not to mention that water shoots out of the hoses on most everybody's lawns, faucets, squirt guns, balloons, and genitals! Give those aliens some props! Did I mention that I can spit water?

Night Shyamalan has been hailed as the next Spielberg with such writing/directing/producing credits as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs & his new venture, The Village, and rightly so, in my humble opinion.  This film is generally unlike The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable. That is precisely why Signs received mixed reviews from critics at the box office.
Mel Gibson stars as the newly widowed ex-reverend/father Graham Ness. Along with his younger, ex-baseball hero brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and two young children, son, Morgan and little daughter, Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), the recently faithless ex-minister & his family experience accidents, death, crop circles, extra-terrestrials, and much more while director/writer/ producer Shyamalan pursues a spookfest with great (thank you, H.G. Wells) ""War of the Worlds"" undertones.
While the whole Ness clan re-evaluates their spiritual past, present and uncertain future, Graham & Merrill debate/discuss what kind of people they really were while growing up, what kind of people they are now and what the experience that they go through in the film makes them out to be in the end. There are many a spiritual idea/moral to this odd story by Shyamalan & certainly worth a look-see. Does the Ness family perceive a phenomenal occurrence as a series of spiritual signs and heavenly portents, or do they only believe in fate, chance, luck and divine providence?
Watch this oddly, extraordinary film and find out for yourself.

1473998,3,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan rocketed into the pantheon of my favorite modern directors with his first two films, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable.""  His signatures are twofold:  an element of the supernatural, and a glacial pace, which serves to highlight the moments of action that do happen.  The pace in particular would have to be Shyamalan's trademark; after watching only two of his films, I imagine I could now identify another one in the absence of any other information merely by viewing a few minutes' worth.  His characters walk through his stories like zombies, nearly devoid of obvious emotional reactions, contributing to the effect.  The result is peculiarly dreamlike, further enhancing the creepiness of ""Sixth Sense"" and the portentousness of ""Unbreakable.""
Shyamalan's third film is a new take on the basic ""War of the Worlds"" premise--aliens invade and quickly overrun the planet, only to be beaten off by the most primitive of means (although not, in this case, due to disease).  The twist here is that Shyamalan chooses to view the proceedings almost entirely from the perspective of a family of four in their rural Pennsylvania farmhouse; the only window on the rest of the world is provided by the TV.  The family itself is made up of a father (and recently ex-Father) his two children--an asthmatic boy and a younger girl, the latter prone to prophetic dreams--and his brother, an ex-jock who has come to live with the family after the death of their mother.
Shyamalan has a second twist to add, however, in that the real focus of the movie isn't the alien invasion, but a question of faith.  Or, to paraphrase Gibson's character, are you the sort of person who believes in signs and miracles, or who sees only coincidences?
It's an interesting idea, and Shyamalan infuses ""Signs"" with enough style to nearly make you forget the B-movie premise beneath it.  Nearly, that is.  There is enough humor in the movie to deflect accusations that it takes the alien invasion premise too seriously, but the climactic scene is patently ludicrous.  Shyamalan has not provided a blueprint for how to make a ridiculous premise believable in a dramatic presentation.  In the end, the alien invasion gets too much in the way of the crisis of faith that is clearly the main point of the film.  No matter how much I was supposed to care for Gibson's acceptance or rejection of the ""signs"" that have been given him, I failed to see how it amounted to more than a hill of beans in relation to the vast invasion taking place in the wide world outside that farmhouse.
I still want to give Shyamalan his style points, since there are a few moments of genuine eeriness before it gets too silly.  But this is a minor effort compared to Shyamalan's earlier work.",1082332800,4,2755,4.821656050955414

That's what real life is like; something big may be happening, but for most of us, we experience only a tiny little corner of that event.
My only qualm about the film was the plot device of water as a weapon.  If these guys can't take water, why go to a planet that is 3/4 water?  Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to use water symbolically; after all, it is used for baptism.
My only problem with the DVD itself is that there is no option to include the deleted scenes (most of which are really good) into the film in order to makes a sort of Director's Cut. Or if there is, I didn't notice it.",1081209600,,777,4.16

The tension the director builds is gripping.  I like the premise of the story: the crop signs and the creepy happenings at the farm, the mystery surrounding Mel Gibson's character losing his faith in God, and the death of his wife.
But while the setup was great, the actual unfolding of the story left me underwhelmed.  There were just too many blunders in the plot to overlook.  For instance, why wouldn't Gibson's character report what he found behind the cupboard door?  Why wouldn't that have been on the TV news?  Did he just leave that house and not tell anyone?  That makes no sense at all.

My mom just tugged me out of the house repeating the phrase, ""We're going to see the movie Signs, a lot of people said it's really good."" Then at the theater, I saw the poster for it and my jaw dropped when I looked at the crop circle pictured on it. I was entranced by the whole movie and knew that when it came out, I would be waiting at the doors of whatever store was selling it. It gives an important message about how fragile humanity is and that it can take one night for everything to come crashing into pandemonium. It also rules out the possibility that Earth is the only planet supporting life; something that should be more well-known. Signs is a fantastic movie and I advise anybody who loves a chilling extraterrestrial movie to see it immediately.",1079913600,,841,4.3630573248407645
1474092,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan at his best. This tops even The Sixth Sense as Night's supernatural thrillers just keep getting better. In the movie there are many important messages about faith. Mel Gibson plays one of his typical rolls and has a stellar performance.
The film took place on a farm out in Pennsylvania. The scenery and filming is beautiful with great aerial and reflection shots. There were lots of very suspenseful scenes, and some humor thrown in a couple times. Joaquin Phoenix steals the show with a performance even better than his in Gladiator. The overall plat involves Mel Gibson's wife dying and him questioning his faith. Then there begins to be sightings of Crop circle including one on his family's yard. then they begin to attack, and the best part is that they show the TV stations so you really think that they are attacking. Night pulls of an ending even better than the sixth sense and everything pulls together.
I think that the title of the movie can account for the two main plot strands of the movie; one being the signs that he will regain his faith and his wife didn't die for nothing, the other being that of the Crop Signs.
Overall, it is probably in my top ten movies of all time.",1079481600,,1210,4.580645161290323

1474094,4,B00005JL3T,"I have been watching horror and sci-fi films for 30 years and one of the best films in this genre is without a doubt-Signs. It is a very creepy movie because it is not what we see that scares us, it is what we don't see: usually what can be found right in our own backyard. It is not a story about crop circles or flying saucers, It is a story of forgiveness, faith, redemption, honor, belief and love, the many things we hardly see anymore in this world. Some of the best parts of the film are not about the aliens but about the love between a father and his children, especially between the father and his asthmatic son in the film.
This is not a movie for children to watch alone as there is a creepy part which takes place at a childrens birthday party so
it should be watched with parents who can explain the important messages in the film. The director of Signs is the new Rod Serling (The Twilight Zone) because he can take a story with all the morals and values of humanity and blend it with horror, surprise and suspense. Definitely an important film to watch.",1079308800,,1069,4.270935960591133
1474095,5,B00005JL3T,"If you expect sci-fi or if you expect horror from this movie, you may be quite disappointed.  However, if you don't mind watching a movie that is an analogy about the frailties of one man and his struggles with his faith with God, then sit down and put this in: I don't think you will be disappointed.
To me, M. Night's movies have been becoming progressively BETTER.  His movies have gotten deeper and more cerebral.  Sixth Sense is good, but you basically just need to watch that movie twice (once to get surprised by the twist ending and a second time to figure out why you were fooled in the first place).  UNBREAKABLE had a better plot and a better ending (the ending set up two more sequels, so for those that didn't like the ending, you may not have realized that) and is great on repeat viewings.  SIGNS blows the other two out of the water and is a deep movie that requires more than just a surface glance; this movie deserves to be probed, dissected and examined from beginning to end.
The movie is an analogy, most importantly.  The alien invasion is just a background thing and is more than likely a dream.  There is quite a bit in the movie to suggest that it is just a dream, that it's more than what it appears.
**The first shot: the window glass is distorted and then you see Graham's family in a picture.  This could represent how Graham's views of his world and his family have become distorted.  It's also here that Graham wakes up, the first of many times he wakes up in the movie.
**The first sign: Graham is looking for his children in a cornfield and gets lost, representative of his relationship with God and how he is lost and his Father is searching for him, and also representative of the signs God gives us that He's there and cares.
**Graham cannot hear his children in the field later on, pointing out his relationship with God.  While he is derailed from his faith looking for his personal signs that God is there, his communication with God is not what it should be.  He has not forgiven God for losing his wife, and the Bible says that those who have unforgiveness in their heart are not heard by God.
**The first time we see the aliens in the movie (on the TV, though they were present earlier on, as evidenced by the dogs' responses to them) Morgan needs to use his inhaler, and only uses his inhaler when he sees the aliens, a point that I feel is important later in the movie.
**The aliens could be an analogy of demons in the movie, personal demons that Graham has to fight to regain his faith in God.  He is afraid of his demons, and refuses to confront them, and runs from them when confronted with them in the movie, and in the end says he is not ready when the demon tries to get in the basement.  He's not ready to face his demons because he has not worked out his struggle with God at this point to see the signs in his life he is looking for.
**The instances where the invasion is compared to the War of the Worlds and Bo keeps asking if this is all in her dream and Graham keeps waking up as if trying to awake himself from a dream in the entire movie suggests this movie is a dream.  There are other elements, but I will leave that for the viewer to decide.
**We never see how the mid east nations fought off the invasion.  It is ASSUMED to be water, but we do not know.  It's possible that the water in the house was Holy Water, blessed by Bo, as she was pure in spirit and like an angel (I know this is stretching it, but go with me).  Holy Water is seen as having an adverse affect on demons in other movies and media.  I think what really got rid of the demons was prayer, and it was Merrill's prayer in the basement that saved the family in Graham's time of darkest struggle.
**God saves Morgan from dying, and Morgan is able to breathe normally once again.  At the same time, God touches Graham and he can see God's signs clearly for the first time in the movie, and is symbolically touched with the breath of God.  The final pan shot goes through the same window we saw at the beginning, only this time the distorted glass is gone, and Graham's vision or perception of reality is no longer distorted, and he's able to return to work.
If you are expecting INDEPENDENCE DAY or ET from this movie, then you best go and buy or rent those, and leave this one on the shelf.  If you are expecting a movie that makes you THINK and PROVOKES you and requires several viewings to really appreciate it, then by all means pick this movie up.  It's truly a great movie about one man, his struggle with God, and his fight to find the signs in his life that God is there, and his reunion with the God who he loved all along.  It's a beautiful movie.",1078704000,8,4687,4.2593010146561445

1474097,1,B00005JL3T,"There are spoilers in this post. It's practically impossible not to mention some key points and do a good review, so if you mind, for heaven's sake, scroll on by. (Also please take note: The following is merely my opinion, and is only meant as such.)
This is probably one of the most derivative movies I've ever seen. I recognized, in it, bits of X-files, War of the Worlds, Night of the Living Dead, and Morons from Outer Space.
Gibson, who for the first 2/3 of the movie has evidently been directed to behave in the ""Kevin Coster No-Expression School of Acting"" does a good job of portraying a zombie. His brother -- once the audience is even allowed to know who this guy is -- looks like he could be Gibson's son. In fact, I was mystified by the relationships among these two and the children for the longest time. When the female cop called Gibson ""father"" at the beginning, I even thought she was Gibson's daughter. After being emotionless, Gibson then, toward the end, shows a spark of animation -- as ""spark"" is related to ""atom bomb explosion"" -- then lapses back into zombie-land.
These aliens were definitely not the sharpest knives in the universe, coming to Earth, which is predominantly made of water, to eat people, who are predominantly made of water, then choosing the SMALLEST humans, who would probably make a few snacks, but not a real meal. Evidently the aliens, while they were ""probing"" Earth for information had overlooked the fact that water does them irreparable harm. Also, if they can be done in with a baseball bat, what about missiles? Do missles just bounce off? How about a shotgun? And what was up with wood being a problem for them? Wood is DRY! Cornstalks have water in them -- not wood planks.
One good thing about this problem with water -- Seattle was safe; so, most likely, were coastal cities and the cities around the Great Lakes.
As a writer, I had a real problem with the viewpoints used in this movie. The audience, for example, is left hanging at one point, staring up a staircase for what seems an eternity while indistinct noises came from upstairs. This wasn't suspenseful -- it was boring. It's no wonder the characters slept for 12 hours. (12 hours? How could they sleep at ALL with aliens trying to break into the house? Did Gibson's character, perhaps, have a narcoleptic response to extreme stress?)
There are several instances where the audience doesn't even know as much as the characters. This works fairly well in a mystery novel, but if an author wrote something like, ""The father walked upstairs to investigate. There were noises. The stairs were empty. More noises disturbed the silence. The staircase was still empty."" the novel would never get past the slushpile.
Then, for no apparent reason -- at least not one that had anything to do with the plot -- we are treated to the alien's viewpoint as he merely stares, in the best tradition of heroines being menanced by a monster, while water descends, sending him to his doom. We, as the audience, are thinking, ""Ah - THAT saved them some special effects money!""
I'm not sure why the writer wanted us to know this invasion was similar to War of the Worlds. I'd already had that thought and knew that whatever killed off the aliens was going to be something very simple and stupid. And just what did those people in the ""remote villages"" who discovered how to defeat the aliens do that was so mysterious? Did they have primitive garden hoses? Why didn't the TV people just say, ""WATER HURTS AND KILLS THE ALIENS!"" You'd think this would be news to share, not keep to one's self.
I was somewhat offended at the implication that the audience was so simplistic and willing to suspend their disbelief that they wouldn't notice all the movie's problems. I could go on and on about the inconsistencies, bad writing, bad directing and so-on, but you're probably already nodding off.
Suffice to say, I won't be rushing off to see the next movie this fellow does.",1078531200,9,3962,4.661428571428571
1474098,4,B00005JL3T,"I have to agree with a fellow reviewer that the so-called professional reviewer is wrong in calling this a ""B"" movie.  ""Signs"" plays more with your mind and, to an extent, your faith better than most of the schlock that is put out these days.  This film is very intelligent and very, very creepy.  It probes your mind both spiritually(with Gibson's character) and mentally(with the use of the alien invasion).  One of the creepiest moments in this film is when the television report reveals a ""surprise"" at a birthday party(I don't want to give too much info and spoil it).
This one of my favorite movies.  So what if the aliens don't whip up on Harry Connick, Jr. and Will Smith?  Who cares if there aren't any great explosions or uber-starships?  This movie relies on you as the viewer using your mind to fill in the holes.  It's almost like reading a book because your mind builds the story along with the movie.  How dare M. Night make you use your brain!
Watch this movie.  It is sooooo much better than the majority of the reviewers claim.",1078444800,7,1045,4.540106951871658
1474099,2,B00005JL3T,"Okay, aliens are freaky.  Especially these ones.  And especially considering I live in the midwest, surrounded by corn fields.  The first bit of this film was pretty freaky.  Unfortunately, M. Night Shylaman decides to put in some other overtones, and basically the whole film IS, in the end, about a priest who loses his faith then regains it after he realizes that God really DOES have a plan, and yes, his wife dying was part of it.  This movie just suggests that humans have no free will whatsoever and I feel that even Christians will be upset with the message of this film.  It turns silly and corny and doesn't leave me feeling creeped out at all; just upset that I wasted seven bucks.",1077926400,5,692,4.540322580645161
1474187,5,B00005JL3T,"I was surfing through Amazon and this came up in my recommendations. I saw the movie in theatres and was SHOCKED to see they started their review with ""This B movie"". M. Night Shyamalan is such an incredible presence in Hollywood right now that just the mention of his name will draw a ""water cooler crowd"" to the area panting to hear about his new release. (This actually happened a few weeks ago). This movie didn't let any of his fans down and probably created new legions of admirers. The scene where 2 children and a grown man have foil on their heads is just priceless and evokes memories of the great Twilight Zone episodes. We live in a CGI Mania society where no one wants to use their own imagination. Most savvy movie goers do not need thousands of CGI spaceships to understand the emotions of an Alien Invasion.
Night has a great story and incredible performances by both of the children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin). Joaquin Phoenix also outshines the overrated Mel Gibson. It is comical the Amazon reviewer finds fault with the movie and script and lauds Gibson's performance. Buy the DVD and give the movie your full attention. Forget it is ""Mel Gibson"". His character is tremendous and the heart of the story. His acting isn't. Put yourself in the minds of the characters and try to think of what YOU would do if there was a reality of an Alien Invasion. Try to figure out where you would go and what you would do.
To call this movie ""vaguely hollow"" is the same as saying that all Bruce Willis did was watch a ring drop on the floor. (Sixth Sense). I look to PROFESSIONAL reviewers to ask MORE of a movie than lots of special effects. If you are looking for thousands of spaceships, millions of bullets and buckets of blood, this movie won't be to your liking.
On the other hand, if you want a kick-ass story, great acting, and a chance to use your imagination for a 2 hour roller coaster ride, this is just the ticket for you!",1077753600,4,1949,4.46218487394958

My favorite character is Morgan, my favorite scean is where the family is hiding in the basement.  NOTE: I only saw the VHS version, but the DVD probably isn't to much different.
In the movie, a family with a lost mother/wife.  The family, Graham, Merril, Morgan, and Bo Hess, wake up one morning to find a gigantic crop-circle in their field.  Graham thinks it's only a hoax made by Lionel Prichardson and the Wolfington Brothers.  While watching the news on TV, they discover crop-circles are being made all over the entire world.  Soon, extraterrestrials are found all over the earth.  Aliens try to invade the Hess' home one night after Graham accidentally cuts an extraterrestrial's fingers.  After trying to bord the house up (forgetting the attic door), they hide for a while in their family room.  The extraterrestrials discover how to get in and you get to see an alien's hand.  The family runs off into the basement and hide from the extraterrestrials.  Even though one of them almost captures Morgan, they live out the night and find out the extraterrestrials are leaving without the ones the humans have wounded.  Feeling it safe to open the basement door a return to normal life, they go upstairs while Morgan's breathing problems (triggered by fear and were set off the night before), begin.  While Merril gets medicine, the extraterrestrial catches Morgan.  Because of Bo's drinking water problem, Merril beats the alien and Morgan is healed.  Graham becomes a reverend again and they live their lives.

1474192,1,B00005JL3T,"This film is mostly awful. As mentioned in many previous reviews, the depiction of the Aliens is simply ridiculous -- truly primitive, vicious creatures. I've got news for you M. Night Shyamalan -- any aliens who possess the capability of interstellar space travel will not be so primitive. In response to what a previous reviewer wrote: ""...I think this is simplistic - why do people always assume that aliens, if they do exist, are more advanced than we are? Couldn't it be possible that humans are in fact the most advanced life form in the universe?..."". Are you serious? Humans are at least hundreds, perhaps thousands of years from realizing interstellar space travel. No, if there are indeed life forms in the universe that are advanced as depicted in ""Signs"", it's not possible that humans are the most advanced life forms in the universe. Period.
And then there's the curious vulnerability that they have to H2O. Ridiculous.
I'm not even going to go into the religious aspect of the film -- equally ridiculous.
I will say that there are moments of genuine suspense, but these are wasted because the story is such nonsense. Gibson does a nice job with his role to try and give the film some credibility, but this script is beyond even his star power to save.

1474194,5,B00005JL3T,"Aliens. Aliens invading the earth from another planet, with capabilities of spraying small amounts of poison gas at their enemies; aliens whose skin can take on the nature of their environment. Sound like your corny, everyday science fiction plot? On paper, yes-but here we're dealing with M. Night Shyamalan. With him, it's different.
  Signs is not what anyone in his right mind would compare with the sort of B-grade film you would expect from this genre. Not only does its suspense come in tantalizing, well-done bits-it also deals with far deeper matters.
  One factor that makes this film so good is its small scope-a lot of the film, and certainly the most climactic moments, is filmed within one house and its surrounding cornfield. For this type of movie, this limited scope is perfect. Rather than seeing spaceships land on wheat fields or little alien communities living on blasted planets, most of what we can see is restricted to the observance of Graham Hess and his children, and his brother Merrill. And being a family in rural Pennsylvania, this isn't much.
  As I said, the suspense comes in little snatches. First we find gigantic crop circles in the Hess cornield-and no explanation as to how it happened. Then on the TV we see that similar crop circles have been appearing in hundreds of places all over the world. Graham and Merrill chase a mysterious intruder around their house-who they think is a local troublemaker-and find out that he has jumped the ten-foot space from the ground to their roof, and that they need to re-think their ideas on who it was.
  And so it builds...the very atmosphere of the movie is wonderful. It was inspired by Hitchock's The Birds, but in my opinion Signs tops that by a long shot.
  As to the acting-it's all good. Mel Gibson is not what I would call a perfect actor, but his role as Graham Hess is not incredibly demanding, and he doesn't do very badly at all. He is by no means one of those actors who distracts the viewer attention by giving a bad performance.
  Giving a better performance is Joaquin Phoenix as his brother Merrill. You ought to ask-Roman emperor Commodus as a Pennsylvanian who works at a gas station? That's right, and he pulls it off admirably well, with a perfect balance of humor and drama, depending on what the situation requires. And he is, of course, helped along by Shyamalan's superb screenplay.
  Graham's son Morgan is the one flaw in this otherwise wonderful film. To put it in a nutshell...he's a brat. His brash, know-it-all behavior toward his father is extremely disrespectful, but mercifully doesn't take up much screen time. Seriously-in every aspect of life, who knows better? The father or the son? Obviously, the father would know more, but Morgan seems either not to realize this or ignore it in the film. I wish his character had been changed. But his mannerisms don't get too much time on the screen. Don't let it turn you off to this great film.
  His sister Bo (interesting name for a girl) is much better as a character, and far easier to watch on screen than her brother. The actress who plays her does quite well, especially considering the fact that she must be quite young.
  Then we come to Shyamalan's directing. We're talking about the man who helmed the tiller of the Sixth Sense here...it's tough to go wrong. The slow revealing of the aliens, the realism of the TV coverage of the invasion, the nail-biting suspense of the attack on the Hess' house, etc.-it's all awesome.
  Besides portraying an invasion of the earth from extraterrestiral sources, Signs also deals with other things-with some ""signs"", as a matter of fact. This name does not deal strictly with the crop signs. We find out in the course of the film that Graham Hess was formerly a minister, but after the death of his wife left the church and thought he had left his faith. But throughout the course of the film events come together in such a way that he can have no doubt that Someone is watching over him and his family, and in the end his faith is regained. Wow-this sounds rather close to Christianity. Keep it up, Shyamalan!
  For dealing with a genre like extraterristials, Signs is the best of its kind that I have run into. It's definitely worth seeing.",1076371200,,4248,4.696765498652291
1474195,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted filmmaker, definitely. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and now..Signs; you can tell he's getting better and better at his craft and that's a good thing. Signs tells the story of a widower whose own crisis of faith coincides with the appearance of mysterious crop circles in his Pennsylvania cornfield... as well as hundreds of UFOs around the globe.  Along with his brother and two children, he slowly sees this occurence to be a sign of things to come...which ultimately has to do with the climatic ending. Instantly, you can tell this is Night's nod to ""War of the Worlds"" but, before you dismiss this to be a B-movie, it isn't by any means. Outstanding performances by Mel Gibson, Joaqin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin make this movie a believable one and a fine one to boot. I enjoyed it and was glued to my seat for the whole duration of the movie. It's thrilling, atmospheric, and downright spooky, at times. Course, there a few humorous moments in there, as well.

1474293,3,B00005JL3T,"I admit it: I saw this movie over two times in the theatres and I loved it. However, I need to be completely honest in this review so bare with me fans of the film...I'm going in! Mel Gibson stars as a former reverend in a small town, who lives on a farm with his brother and two children after his wife died about a year ago. When mysterious things begin to happen and crop circles appear on his land, the family begins to believe that they are being pursued by aliens from outer space. Surprisingly scary and well-acted, this film does show that it got its inspiration from George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. I mean, come on: group of people board themselves up in a house while the otherworldy enemies await them outside and desperately try to get in. But otherwise, I found this film to be extremely enjoyable and therefore, I had to see it several times. The theatre experience of this film however, is alot better than just seeing it on video or DVD.",1075334400,,963,4.385474860335195
1474294,3,B00005JL3T,"As I haven't seen ""Sixth Sense"", I don't have that supposedly great film to help  prepare me for this one.  And when I finally got ready to watch it, I didn't know what to expect because some of my friends panned it while others raved about it.  When it was over, I found that I had very mixed reactions.
On one hand, as one of my friend's is quick to point out, this movie ISN'T ABOUT THE ALIENS.  If you are watching this movie to see a good alien flick, then I think you will be disappointed.  That's not where the script focused its effort.  Rather, the script simply used the aliens as an instrument in the faith journey of Gibson's character.  For, you see, Gibson's character was an Episcopalean priest in town that everyone looked up to.  However, several months BEFORE the crop circles, Gibson stepped back from his position and his faith at the tragic and seemingly senseless death of his beloved wife.  His God allowed split-second timing & eerie coincidences take her away, and he couldn't forgive God or make sense of his belief system any longer.
With this perspective in mind, the relative simplicity of the aliens should not come as a surprise.  However, what did come as a surprise to me was the incredible oversimplicity of the ending.  Not to give anything away, but the plot tries to pull together everyone's quirks in a way that are necessary to bring salvation.  It's an event that supposed to show how God is in control and has orchestrated everything all along.  It's a key time in Gibson's faith journey.
However, I found this scene flat and stale.  It was too one-dimensional to actually seem like the act of a infinite almighty.  Like with ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"", I felt let down by a short-sighted feel-good ending that really leaves you with more questions than assurance.
Feeling that this movie failed in delivering on its main thrust and seeing that it really didn't develop the sci-fi material too much, I thought it was a bit of a let down in the end.",1074556800,2,1988,4.56056338028169
1474295,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs was one of the best films of 2002. It captured our hearts and our minds, and it was a masterpiece that could only come from M. Night Shyalaman. The premise of Signs is simple;an alien invasion is about to take over earth. But the way that the film was made is not so simple. It grabs you by the throat and never lets go. Signs appeals to all ages, as it is a non-terrifying and non-gory thriller, fitted for both kids and adults. Some people may be mad that Mel Gibson doesn't shoot up the aliens with a 12-gauge, and this film is indeed a depart from his other work. However, Signs is also quite refreshing, and I had no idea that Touchstone could produce a film as good as Signs. The tension gradually builds in the film, from crop-circles, to shapes in the darkness, to an announcer on T.V. reporting the invasion as helpless viewers wait for the apocalypse to pass in 9/11 style! The whole movie is executed wonderfully, and I loved Signs! Please check this film out! It was one of the best movies of 2002.",1074556800,,1016,4.352631578947369

When I think about questions of logic like this, and others, I have a hard time with the credibility of this movie, but I still like the suspense created here and Mel Gibson is always worth a look.

Signs seems to be the kind of movie that Alfred Hitchcock would have made if he had chosen to collaborate with Rod Serling.  Writer/producer/director M. Night Shymalan gives the movie a nice dream like quality, which might explain some of the story's logic problems, but the film's visual sense is so strong, and Shymalan's gift at moving the viewer to the edge of his or her seat so pronounced, that the more forgiving veiwers can enjoy this for what it is - an entertaining Twilight Zone episode that misses the classic mark by just enough to qualify it for guilty pleasure status.",1074211200,,785,4.7153284671532845

Everything that farmer Graham Hess (Gibson) assumed about the world changes when he ands his brother Merrill (Phoenix) wake up one morning to find the dogs barking and the children, Bo (Breslin) and her brother Morgan (Culkin) wandering bleary eyed in the corn fields.  Upon further investigation they discover a pattern of perfectly formed crop circles.  Trying not to overreact, Graham ignores the worldwide media frenzy that extraterrestrial life may be invading earth and has to search deep within himself for a faith that he once had to pull his family through the ordeal.
Review
The director of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable appears to be determined to carve himself a niche.  With each viewing of these three films one becomes aware of the recurring themes of distance & finding oneself and a prominent style of silence & enchantment from this emerging auteur.  Shyamalan, who gives a competent cameo in the film as a veterinarian who 6 months prior to the action of the movie fell asleep at the wheel of his car and ran down Hess' wife, has the potential to be the next Spielberg for the start of the 21st Century.  He writes his own films and manages to continue to deliver stories with a passion and lack of pretension that is rarely seen in the cinema today.
The script is simply brilliant as it concerns itself far more with what is not said and rather looks to what is and should be implied.  It is an actors text and is delivered with an unrelenting passion by Gibson who I firmly believe is the modern embodiment of the `everyman' as he never fails to engage and has that rare skill of minimalistic acting that can say so much with so little.  Phoenix is competent throughout and works well as the distant brother who finds the faith that the elder Hess lost after leaving the Church following his wife's death.
This is the anti-Independence Day, this is not about tall buildings being blown up or motherships being defeated through the convenient compatibility of an Apple I Mac and an Alien Parallel Port.  In fact, this isn't a lot about Aliens themselves, but rather its more than that: its about remembering who you are and your place in the world, and its importance no matter who you are - essentially its about faith.  The only failing in this film comes in the last ten minutes and is primarily the fault of a poorly edited sequence, where a powerfully emotive scene is cut away from too quickly and returns later with far less impact.
The Verdict
If Shyamalan continues along the path he has begun to cut for himself, I have no doubt that his body of work will mature well.  Catch one of best up and coming Hollywood storytellers today so you can tell your kids about him tomorrow.  This is a brilliant film that offers so much on so many levels and sustains a tension throughout without falter or distraction.",1073433600,,2846,4.638170974155069

THE GOOD:
--This film scared me on a deep level, to the point of it probably being one of the scariest films I've ever seen. The 'boo' frights were terrific and many of them made me jump out of my skin. The scares work best when they are psychological and silent, or all in your head. Just imagine what this family goes through, particularly in the brilliant finale. M Night Shyamalan puts you right in their shoes and doesn't let up with the terror until the very last frame.
--Is ""Signs"" a horror movie? Yes. Is it a sci-fi movie? Yes. But when it all comes down to it, what is this movie genre-wise? This movie, to me at least, was all about the tale of this family, and the strife they're going through after losing someone close to them. The father is a priest who has lost all faith and the kids prefer their father's brother. ""Signs"" is about aliens, but it's about how the alien attack affects the family and makes them bring out the love and trust they all must have in each other to survive such a horrifying ordeal. This was shown amazingly in the wonderful and tragic final dinner scene.
--Mel Gibson gives one of his finest performances to date. He is a tour-de-force as Graham Hess; he sold me completely in his role. The inner turmoil the character was experiencing was so brilliantly portrayed by Gibson, during quiet, lonely moments or through big, dramatic scenes such as the aforementioned final dinner scene. Joaquin Phoenix was very strong and always believable in his supporting performance as Graham's brother Merrill. The adorable Abigail Breslin and another one of the Culkin clan, Rory Culkin, are terrific rising stars with a lot of talent at such young ages.
--M Night Shyamalan continues his run of terrific writing/directing efforts, he brings across the suspense of the situations in the film seamlessly, and injects a lot of emotion into the film. The strange and subtle camera movements and angles were also much appreciated.
THE BAD:
--I must warn that this section of my review has nothing more, nothing less than THE BIGGEST SPOILERS FOR ""SIGNS"". DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISHED TO BE SPOILED! Like many others, I found the way the extra-terrestrials were defeated at the end of the film a little ludicrous and too convenient. This has all been said before - but why the goddamn hell would the aliens invade a planet that is 75% water and they're allergic to the stuff? END SPOILERS!
RATING:
9/10 - Another moving film experience from the one and only M Night Shyamalan, also his most terrifying motion picture to date.
IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:

The Ring (8/10)
Scary Movie 3 (3/10)

1474300,4,B00005JL3T,"Shyamalan definitely keeps his title as the master of suspense with ""Signs"". He's able to take the simplest everyday things and scare the crap out of you with them. After seeing this film, you will never view a cornfield, baby monitor, or scratching noise in your house the same again.
If you've seen the commercials, you know that aliens play a key role in the film. Shyamalan is able to totally keep you on the edge of your seat by showing nothing more of them than shadows or claws. What also is amazing is that the aliens are, for the most part, seen in the full daylight. He doesn't always have the scary parts take place at night. Daytime isn't the safe haven that it usually is in a scary movie. This film also uses the theater sound system effectively by having sound effects of the aliens skittering over the house move all around the theater. It will totally freak you out. It's amazing how Shyamalan makes an effective alien invasion movie by hardly showing them at all. He knows that your imagination will create infinitely more terrifying images than he can ever come up with on the screen.
This film takes some of the best elements of War of the Worlds and Close Encounters and repackages them for new audiences. It also combines several elements of UFO mythology into a cohesive tale. One of the most notable things about it is that it tells a very personal story. In the face of a global event, we concern ourselves only with what's happening in this particular family. We see everything from their point of view and from their isolated world. However, the true heart of this film's story is a man's restoration of faith in God and rebuilding bonds with his family. If you're looking for a good scare and an interesting twist on the whole alien invasion concept, this is one you'll want to check out.
After ""The Sixth Sense,"" everyone expects Shyamalan's movies to have some earth-shattering twist at the end. With ""Signs,"" there's no major revelation at the end as you might hope for. Despite lacking that hoped for twist, the movie is still a little confusing and it may not necessarily answer all of your questions. Most of my unanswered questions involved what was happening beyond the Hess' house. But since that wasn't the focus of the film, my questions were never sufficiently addressed. However, the more time I think about ""Signs"" after seeing it, the more I think the ending was OK. I guess I was expecting something more dramatic.",1073001600,,2458,4.652873563218391
1474301,5,B00005JL3T,"I have, almost against my will, turned into a big M. Night Shyamalan fan. Anyone who gets as much hype as he has gets a healthy dose of skepticism from me. However, ""Sixth Sense"" and now ""Signs"" have won me over.
The mood and atmosphere of this movie are remarkable. By portraying world-shaking events from the perspective of a single, damaged-yet-strong family, Shyamalan personalizes the story for us and gives us a unique view. By not showing us very much of the invaders, he manages to scare our pants off when he does.
More to that point - the first glimpse of the visitors is one of the most startling things I've ever seen and was the point where both the movie and the director earned my admiration. What a great bit of film-making!
Both Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix demonstrate that they are fine actors. They are both entirely believable in their roles, which are a big departure for both of them. The supporting cast is good, if unremarkable. The director makes a brief appearance. He does a fine job of acting the part, but physically seems out of place in small-town America. Perhaps that's a bit un-PC, but it sorta jumped off the screen at me.
All in all, ""Signs"" is a lot of fun. I'm not ready to call Shyamalan ""The Next Spielberg"", but I am looking forward to his next effort.",1072828800,,1296,4.519148936170213

1474390,5,B00005JL3T,"The Summer of 2002 has not been a generally good time for Touchstone Pictures or Walt Disney Studios in general. Bad Company, which starred Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, and The Country Bears flopped at the box office while Reign of Fire barely recouped its moderate $60 million production budget. So it is no surprise that they are hoping that their last film of the summer finishes the season better then the previously mentioned films had started. Director M. Night Shyamalan has been described by many as the next Spielberg and for good reason. The Sixth Sense became one of the biggest surprises of 1999 when the film grossed nearly $300 million domestically on a relatively small $40 million production budget. His second film, Unbreakable, was met with less success at the box office but acquired a cult following when the film became available on DVD. Disney is obviously hoping that Signs will bring about Sixth Sense-like success or will this show the decline of rising director's prosperity?
The story focuses on a man named Graham Hess, a former minister, and his family as the world faces a major conflict. Graham is the father of two children who lives on a farm just outside the city of Philadelphia along with his brother, Merrill, a former minor league baseball player. A car accident that took the life of his wife causes Graham to lose his faith and makes him question the ways of the world. One morning, he discovers a crop circle that has appeared in his corn fields. At first he dismisses the crop circle as a prank and nothing more. But soon news from around the world shows that these crop circles are appearing all over the world and in greater numbers then pranksters could ever create in a short amount of time. Soon mysterious lights begin to appear in the sky over major cities around the world. Everything that we had feared about life from other worlds is coming true and an invasion by these alien life forms appears imminent. Graham must now find the faith within himself in order to save the lives of his family. The story, which written by Shyamalan himself, is done magnificently. Humor is mixed with intense plot in well placed areas where it is needed the most. The length of the plot does not seem too long nor too short which is so rare in most movies today.
The cast of Signs is very well put together. Mel Gibson, who has starred in such successful films as Braveheart, What Women Want, and Lethal Weapon, is sure to have another huge hit on his hands with Signs. Gibson does a wonderful job with the crucial role of Graham Hess. He shows a great range of emotions throughout the film and one of the best examples of this is the scene involving the last supper with his family before the aliens invade. Joaquin Phoenix, who is probably best know for his role in the Academy Award winning Gladiator, is a great surprise as Graham's brother Merrill. His character adds well needed humor in certain places within the course of the film. Some child actors in films seem too cute and can often ruin the effect of a film but the children in Signs don't do that. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are perfect in their roles and make the audience both laugh and cry. M. Night Shyamalan, who made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense, takes on the role of the man who killed Graham's wife in a car accident, which shows that his genius goes beyond directing and writing.
Overall, Signs spells out another huge success for the rising director M. Night Shyamalan as well as for actor Mel Gibson. This is clearly the best film of 2002 and one the best films in recent memory. The aliens are not seen fully until the end of the feature but Shyamalan is the only director in the movie industry today that can scare the heck out of an audience with just noises. The musical score by James Newton Howard is one of the biggest highlights of the film. Howard, who scored such films as The Sixth Sense, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire, out does himself with the brilliantly exciting score from the opening credits till the conclusion of the film. There are so many wonderful things to say about this film that any negative comments seem trivial. Though the ending to Signs does seem a bit cheesy that is the effect that Shyamalan is trying to get across. Much of the film is a slight parody of the old 1950's B-movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the film does come off as a bit of tribute to those films. But Shyamalan makes the film his own and does so with excellent flare and style. Signs is sure to remain one of the best films of the year and everyone should make it their duty to see this film at least once. You never know when life from other worlds may visit. You would like to be prepared, wouldn't you?",1072569600,2,4757,4.538998835855646
1474391,3,B00005JL3T,"Out of the three films Shyamalan has made, this is the worst. He's a little young to be throwing his name up on every movie he makes now. It's not like he's Spielburg. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but he simply doesn't have the credit to be trying to use his name to throw up on every film in order to express how good it is. Since the Sixth Sense his films have been progressively getting worse. ""Unbreakable"" was decent, but nowhere near as intelligent as his first film. And casting himself in the movie, albeit in a small part, was a mistake. He's acting like he's Hitchcock all of a sudden.

Signs was entertaining, but not something I would have enjoyed in the theater, and not something I'd be interested in seeing again. The plot was a bit broken up, and you couldn't really understand the central theme. Was this a film about a man who loses his faith, or aliens taking over the world? I was looking forward to this film because of the director, and because of my fascination with crop circles, which didn't really have much to do with the actual movie.

I suppose it's a decent film if you're bored and want to rent it one night, but don't expect any of the great plot twists like you see in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. Hopefully, Shyamalan will get back on track with his next project.",1072396800,,1305,4.366255144032922
1474392,1,B00005JL3T,"This movie has one of the dumbest villains of all time! The evil aliens in the movie are destroyed by water because it's toxic to their skin!
One would assume that having achieved inter-galactic space travel, these aliens would at least possess a level of intelligence that is at least equal to, if not greater than humans. And yet they have decided to attack a planet with water without even a protective suit, a very tragic mistake indeed.
Also, these technologically advanced aliens are still in the stone ages when it comes to weapons. The only weapon that they have is a weak poison gas with a tiny effective range, which is of course no match for even the average Super Soaker.
To further weaken the plot, the movie also brings the idea of God to the forefront by suggesting that everything has a purpose and keeping faith in God is the only way to stay out of trouble and find peace in oneself. Does this mean the aliens have no God to protect them? Or does it mean that the God that protects the aliens was also destroyed by the God that protects Mel Gibson?",1072051200,6,1066,4.4438775510204085

However, the previews for this movie lead one to believe this is just some fun fluff that won't arouse any sincere emotion, and that's just not the case.  I went to see this movie in the theater with my girlfriend, and after it was over, both of us were just staring at the credits, scratching our heads and saying, ""Huh?""

1474395,1,B00005JL3T,"There is so much that's bad about this movie that I would need much more space than is provided here. Thus, I'll keep my comments brief and focus on the major flaws.
First, of course, is the utilization of crop circles as a film subject. As crop circles are proven hoaxes (this is general knowledge now; see Sagan and others for complete details), Shyamalan does the viewer and the scientific community a diservice by appealing to the film's circle manifestations as alien constructions. How could the original pranksters have known that their hoaxes would eventually be ""authentically"" replicated? The coincidental effect is that the viewer is left laughing at the whole premise.
Second, the editing of this film is horrible with scenario segments not following each other in an increasingly suspenseful fashion. Thus, when a new scene appears the viewer is left to yawn through another long drawn-out scene (the effect is one of boredom and this film suffers incredibly from this problem). In effect, the general difficulty is the pacing of the film.
Third, the acting is wooden and entirely inappropriate at points. The worst offender is Culkin who just does not act like a real boy. He acts far too grown-up for his age. In some respects the same can be for the daughter.
Fourth, there is the comedic factor. At times, characters do not seem real (the recruiting officer for instance). If this is Shyamalan's attempt to add comedy to the proceedings, he falls flat on his face.
There are, of course, more flaws, but I'll stop here. Viewers have now been warned.",1070755200,4,1565,4.887218045112782
1474396,1,B00005JL3T,"I have long been a fan of Mel Gibson's films, and was looking forward to what I was certain was a tense sci-fi thriller.  I have rarely been so mistaken.
Most of the dialogue in the film is spoken in somber tones and in whispers.  The depth of the darkness and depression in the film astounded me, and I am willing to concede that some of it was necessary, but not to this extreme.  This was a family, yet they acted as if they only had the slightest of connections to each other.
I found every  ""twist"" utterly predictable.  I saw it all coming, and kept hoping I would be wrong, and the film would surprise me.  It didn't.
To my way of thinking, a good film will draw you so completely into the story that you feel what the characters feel and can think what the characters are thinking.  Not only did I not feel whatever the characters were thinking, but I also didn't care.
The heavy handed lighting, camera angles, and shots that just made me think the director was trying so hard to be clever kept me thinking more about the technique than about the story, which was probably a good thing, because the story seemed incomplete in so many ways.
If there had been more normal moments in the beginning of the family behaving like a family instead of jumping right into the wierdness it might have provided a contrast to the later craziness.  If there had been a few light moments here and there, it might have relieved some of the overall dark mood of the film.
As it was by the end, all I could think was thank goodness it's over.",1070409600,6,1533,4.317073170731708
1474397,5,B00005JL3T,"The third film by Shyamalan is a flawless presentation of the art of film making, the craft of which matches Hitchcock or Kieslowski at their heights.  The story lines, the acting and the general theme can be a subject of criticism if you like, personally I found nothing to complain about and much to enjoy.  But the actual creation of the images on film, my goodness, what about that could be criticized?
There are so many delightful moments here it's difficult to know where to start.  Every scene is scripted with intricate attention to detail, each a little gem in their own right.  The camera always knows where to be, rushing up to focus in or drawing back to include the overall scene just exactly like your own eye would wish to see.  What's going on over there?  You want to see, so the camera runs over and checks it out for you, sometimes being bound by physical reality, becoming another actor in a sense, a kind of avatar on your behalf, as if you were a person standing in the film.  A lot of films may attempt that feeling, but few with the kind of precision and careful consideration displayed here.
And the way he uses sounds, everything is so well thought out.  The volume control of a dog barking becomes a crucial part of the picture, the metallic sound of a water pan sliding across the ground a warning, silence an omen.  It's just all so darn perfect.
If I was forced to pick one scene(aside from the brilliant children's party tape, one of the scariest moments in motion picture history), it would have to be when Joaquin Phoenix is confronting the alien, Mel Gibson running out of the house with his son, and the little girl trailing behind.  The camera moves with them, away from the scene, but we want to see what's going on inside.  Instead of simply moving the camera back, he performs a double trick, having the little girl feel the same way we do.  She stops and turns back, stepping up to the window, placing her hands on the sills and peering inside, the camera going with her, pausing in back of her as if it was a person standing behind her, trying to look around her, and then becoming free, moving forward through the broken window pane to capture more of the scene.  It's absolutely breathtaking, I had to laugh out loud in delight when it happened.  Then the music swells to the climax and gentles out as the camera swings by the boarded-up window to many months later out the next window . . . man, it's so obvious when you see it happen and so difficult to conceive, and there are so many masterful touches like that, dozens of them.
This guy is a certified genius.  The first two movies were good, but this . . . top twenty all time, no kidding.  And he's just getting started.  We're so lucky to be here, waiting for the rest, as if we just saw our first Hitchcock movie in the 40's, with all of the incredible work of the next two decades to follow.

1474499,5,B00005JL3T,"In my many years as a fan of horror films, few have ever actually been even the slightest bit scary.  Signs is not only scary, it is scary in the second or third watching.
Signs is two stories seamlessly sewn into one.  At the heart we have Mel Gibson as a single father.  He had been a man of the cloth until the death of his wife.  Now he is trying to raise his children with the help of his younger brother.
In the larger picture, the world is undergoing some amazing events.  We experience them through Gibson's family.  Like an Anton Checkov play, most of the action is off screen and thus scarier.
As Gibson is trying to hold his family together, something happens in his corn field.  Cornstalks are bent in strange symbols.  Rustling, shadows and strange noises are used to great effect that literally raised the hair on the back of my neck.
Gibson faces family and world events while trying to come to terms with his shaken faith.  Faith is at the heart of this movie and Gibson's portrayal is brilliant.
Pay attention to the details.  Everything seems to have a purpose.  Even watch it a second time as casual remarks in the beginning take on new meaning once you know more of past events (i.e. Gibson's insistence at using a people doctor when the dog gets sick).
In many ways I find this movie superior to The Sixth Sense even though the later was more favored by the media.  But both show seamless storytelling and great attention to detail.

It think that a lot of people didn't like it because it was portrayed in the trailers to be a horror/thriller about crop circles and aliens... and really, that was the background story. So, I think that the Blair Witch lovers out there were a little disappointed that it wasn't what it was made out to be in commercials.
The movie is about a widowed-ex-priest and father of two(Mel Gibson)who is having a hard time coming to grips with the death of his wife. His brother moves in the farm-house with him to help him with the housework and the kids.
Out of nowhere, these perfectly detailed crop circles start popping up in the middle of their corn fields - and when they turn on the news they find out that they're not alone!

And when it is revealed that aliens are behind the crop-circles and that they are planning on taking over earth, panic breaks loose all over the world as people search for a way to fight them off.
But, as I stated above, the aliens and crop circles aren't the main focus of the movie. The movie has a much deeper plot - trying to drive home the fact that EVERYTHING in life - no matter how insignificant it might seem at the time - happens for a reason. Like the daughter who drives her father crazy with the bad habit of leaving half-full glasses of water ALL over the house, his son having asthma, his wife's last words, his brother-in-law being an ex-baseball rookie... it was all for a reason - to help them fight off the aliens in the end.
I think that it was a really good ending. If you watch it and don't expect a horror flick or a movie full of intesnse suspense, then I think that you will enjoy the movie too. It's full of good acting, some laughs, and a deep, meaningful plot. I recommended it.",1069200000,2,1924,4.273972602739726

Yikes! I normally feel that there are very few works, of any kind, that deserve one star...but I just couldn't justify giving this two. This was just a REALLY BAD MOVIE! Sixth Sense was pretty good, although IMO it was let down a little let with the casting of Bruce Willis in the lead (don't have much against Willis, just thought he was all wrong for that part); Unbreakable was asinine; in its own way, Signs might've been even worse. It's not just a matter of this movie being ""oversold"" by friends, relatives, acquaintences, and some reviews--I would've thought it was dumb anyway.
1) The movie was hyped to be more about the crop circles than it really was. After the first part of the movie, the whole crop circle angle essentially dropped out of sight. If the crop circles were going to be used to set up the plot, it seems like it would've made sense to provide a bit more information about their purpose, other than to just have the omnipresent TV voice say they might be some sort of navigation device. You go to the trouble of showing all of these elaborate designs, including using them in all of the publicity for the movie, and then don't provide more info about them? Kind of like a little ""bait and switch,"" almost. I'm not really much into crop circles or UFO's, but I think that most of the people who saw this movie were pulled in by the whole crop circle angle, yet this was just one of one of the many story elements that were not fully developed in this film.
2) The chain of foreshadowing, revealed at the end of the movie, was really a strecth, much more so than either of M. Night's two earlier movies (even the fragile Unbreakable). I think it's time for him to abandon this whole device. It's the kind of plot device that really only works in a one or two movies, anyway...but for the whole thing to be set up by the dying wife uttering, ""Swing away, Merrill?"" Then the daughter's leaving half-full (or half-empty, if you prefer) glasses of water lying around turn out to be a vehicle for the ""alien's"" (and I'll get to them in a minute) demise? Then the son's asthma ends up saving his life.
This film takes the whole, ""everything happens for a reason,"" concept (which I happen to believe BTW), and hits the viewer over the head with it (no pun intended) in the most unsubtle ways. So we're supposed to buy that the minister's wife goes out for a walk before dinner, so that the vet (played by M. Night himself, apparently representing the eastern mystic ""[SUV]ehicle"" for the events to unfold) could fall asleep at the wheel and smash her into a tree, so that she could have the ""Swing away, Merrill"" prophecy, that would help to save the rest of the family? And, correspondingly, the minister's brother's not being able to lay off a bad pitch was also a vehicle for the rest of the family to be saved? I am a Buddhist, but I am unable to ""suspend my disbelief"" enough to buy this implausible ""karma chain."" This all just seemed dumb, dumber, dumbest, to me. A sixth grader could write a better screenplay than this.
3) A fifth grader could come up with more original ""aliens"" than these. Spider men who shot poison gas out of their wrists instead of webs. Also, the whole hostile alien thing has been way overdone in movies for like half a century now. If we're going to continue to make ""little green, or gray, or plaid, men"" movies, Let's try to be a little more original with their appearance--and their motives for traveling across the universe to visit this little green and blue planet. The whole chameleon thing was a dumb idea, too. I almost laughed out loud when the alien's arm matched the pattern on the kid's shirt.
4) The acting left something to be desired, too, even Gibson's melodramatic performance (as an aside, I like Mel Gibson, but I'm already getting a bit tired of him using his film career to push his faith in less than subtle fashion, i.e. this role, and his upcoming Christ movie). Certainly not the first time in film history that the kids stole the show in a movie. The worst performance may have been from the woman who played the sheriff.
5) Another thing I just thought of, on the subject of faith. I'm sorry but, ""crisis of faith,"" or not, what daddy--let alone an ex-minister--would deny his young son a prayer at the dinner table, especially when they all think the world's about to come to an end? He lets him have french toast and mashed potatoes for his ""last supper,"" but he can't muster up one last prayer? Sorry, I'm not buying that for a minute. That whole dinner table seen was really dumb, esp. Gibson's part.
6) The usually weak and oddly placed injections of humor frequently undermined the already tenuous current of tension in the movie.
7) I completely disagree with the reviewer who thought the last 15-20 minutes was so great: I thought this was one of the weakest resolutions I've ever seen in a suspense movie.
8) From what I had heard about the movie, I was expecting a spiritual element to the resolution; but something better than ""minsister loses faith when wife dies...then regains his faith after his brother, and a few half glasses of water, kill an alien to save the rest of his family.""
Bottom line: this movie built up a lot of expectations, both in the publicity for it, and during the movie itself...and it didn't deliver on any of them. Hopefully, M. Night's made enough money to retire now. I'm out.",1069200000,9,5437,4.520812182741117
1474503,1,B00005JL3T,"The point of this childishly sentimental ""religious"" film is that the hero's faith in God is restored when he (an ex-minister, played by Mel Gibson) gets a sign that his wife's death serves a ""higher purpose."" Earth is invaded by some evil aliens who make crop circles (to communicate with each other??). Although millions of people are being killed by them (not at all well communicated by the film, which focuses almost entirely on Mel Gibson's family, perhaps to save money), Gibson ""learns"" that God DOES exist and IS good because some words his dying wife said suddenly make sense and help his family survive the attack of the alien who has a personal grudge against him. Gag.

Even the asthma attacks his son has endured for years suddenly make sense as part of God's great plan! Ditto the glasses of water his apparently nutty daughter has been leaving around the house, and his brother's skill with a baseball bat! God's great plan again! Special effects are virtually nonexistent; the aliens are poorly conceived; worst of all, the film's idea of God is mind-numbingly juvenile: God (in this film) sent aliens to attack earth for the sole purpose of giving Mel Gibson's character renewed faith.

1474562,4,B00005JL3T,"My wife and I entered the movie theater with different expectations, though each of us brought with us pre-conceived ideas as to what this film would be.  Having seen other films by M. Night Shyamalan, I was uncertain that the film would have the edgy feel that an alien-invasion movie should have.  My wife, in contrast, was hoping that she would make it through the film.  By its end, we knew for certain that we wanted to own this film when it became available on DVD.
The general story is simple, an alien force has arrived on Earth, presumably to invade the Earth.  Signs begin to appear in the forms of crop-circles, lights in the sky, strange sounds in the night, shadowy figures seen through windows.  As alien invasion stories go, its pretty much predictable, and Shayamalan uses his expertise to carefully execute each sequence of this invasion in a fashion that is true to his style-giving glimpses and leaving the rest to the audience imagination.
But what makes this a film that surpasses the masses of alien invasion movies is the focus on the characters within the story. It is a story that deals with an individual's loss in his faith.
Graham Hess (wonderfully portrayed by Mel Gibson), is a retired minister who lives in distress, despair and in doubt after the sudden loss of his wife, who died in a car accident.  He, along with his younger brother Merrill (played by Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator)), and his children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), live together on the family farm, where they maintain large fields of corn.
The story opens with the children discovering a massive crop circle in the middle of the field, and from that point forward, stange events begin to unfold.  In counter-point to the alien invasion story, we learn more and more about each character, and the individual quirks, accomplishments, beliefs and doubts that each possess.  As the story grows in its intensity, the movie attempts to ask some very big questions, including the possibility that God allows everything to happen for a reason; that there really is a method to the chaos of our daily existance.
Of course, the movie grows in its intensity as we discover that all the ""signs"" are pointing to an invasion that indicates that the visitors are unstoppable, and that they have arrived for a very specific reason-to harvest humans.  At the same time, the relationships between this family are strained, tested, challenged and ultimately strengthened by the events occuring around them.
The story is well-conceived, although there are some notable flaws in the story, and a climax that, like ""Unbreakable"" before it, leave you going ""huh?""  The logic behind the characters actions is often questionable, and we have to wonder what Shayamalan was considering when he wrote the script.  In addition, his use of subtlety dissolves into an effects-laden ending that is disappointing and predictable, despite the fact that it does contain a logical conclusion to the idea that ""nothing happens by chance.""
In all, it is a strong film, and definitely creepy.  From our individual experience, my wife and I were both so engrossed in the film at our initial viewing of it, and so caught up in the intensity of it, that we were both ready to leave the theather at certain points.  M. Night Shayamalan does know how to build tension, fear, and terror, and he does it in a way that is so subtle, it creeps on you unexpectedly, making you jump, or just peak through your fingers as you clutch your hands over your eyes.  I have been a fan of this genre for a very long time, and I cannot remember having such a powerful reaction to any film before this one since I was a child-it is that good, and, save for the mildly disappointing ending, and loop-holes in the story, it is an excellent film which reaches beyond the realm of an E.T. invasion story and asks some really big questions.
Well worth the time and money.
In addition to the movie, the DVD edition of ""Signs"" also includes a 6 part feature on the making of this film, along with deleted scenes, and a short filmed by Shayamalan as a youth.  The deleted scenes and the short aren't worth a whole lot, but the making of is an insightful journey into the process of creating a film, and worthwhile viewing.",1066262400,2,4271,4.737196765498652

It is readily apparent that Shyamalan has made the same film 3 times - Signs, the Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable. All that had to be done was change the title and choose another paranormal experience to explore...voila...kind of like Hamburger Helper movie making.
Here is my case:
1) All three films dealt with paranormal experience - aliens, super-heroes, and clairvoyance.
2) In all 3 films the children are all seeing. The writer/director pushes the idea that children (due to innocence maybe?) are more apt to trust their eyes or accept that there just might be more to life than what's beyond the surface or what we can feel with the 5 senses.  The protagonist, on the other hand, struggles with these concepts in all three films and, finally, comes to accept the child's view as correct ...in all 3 films.
3) Last but not least, the woman/mother/female figure is powerless, weak and helpless - only able to cry and lament about the situation without being able to offer a hand in solving the problems at hand. Yes, in ALL 3 FILMS!

What did we have here, then? Terribly unconvincing acting by Mr. Mel Gibson, one of the worst performances he's ever turned out. But what can you expect from him with this kind of script? His character is a two-dimensional mess. A widower reverend, who saves the world from aliens. That's about it. There's no real connection. And if you tell me the movie isn't really about aliens but about faith and Christian love and whatnot, I'll tell you plainly to shut up. It's a sci-fi movie, and it's bad sci-fi. If you consider it as a family movie it's even worse. Joaquin Phoenix, remembered fondly from Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, is wasted. And the kids were even more irritatingly cute than Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense - if that's possible. We got mediocre directing (not up to M. Night Shyamalan's standards), bloody awful writing. Shyamalan's dialogue was always bad, but the stories were great. This time we have a story that is not much more than a remake of War of the Worlds. This movie was made dozens of times before. The fact that Phoenix mutters `It's like War of the Worlds' (oh, how self conscious) doesn't make it a parody or a homage. It's still a rip-off. Mars Attacks was a parody; Signs is a rip-off. The film doesn't excuse itself by using higher standards of special effects than were available before - the aliens look so awfully digital it's just pathetic.
And the thing that bothered me worst is this. Watching a Shyamalan film, my expectations low though they were, I knew that as bad as the script will be, I'll still get a lovely, surprising twist ending. Well, there was a surprise. Here's the twist: there's not surprise. The ending is obvious and cheesy as hell. Maybe that's meant to be the surprise - if it is, it's a very tasteless joke. Sorry. The corny love-thy-neighbor-and-god-and-believe-in-yourself messages at the end don't impress me much either. Signs told me nothing I didn't already know. Look, I know all about crop circles, right?

We have a man, who was a devout minister before the tragic death of his wife, living on his farm with his two young children and his brother. The appearance of crop circles sets off a chain reaction of mysterious events that eventually leads to a 'War of the Worlds' style invasion by poisonous, deadly aliens.
There are frequent flashbacks to the incident which killed Gibson's wife, and her confusing last words to him, the meaning of which is finally revealed at the end of movie.
The movie is well-made, and well-acted. Joacquin Phoenix is particularly impressive as the young man who is fed up with his brother's refusal to accept what has happened and get on with life.
I'm afraid the deeper meaning of it all is simply escaping me. It appears that the wife died purely to be able to impart the mystical words that would give the clue to surviving the alien attack that would come in the future.

1474668,1,B00005JL3T,"This movie takes the very promising premise of crop circles and totally ruins it.  Instead of exploring what they can possibly mean, the movie gives us the most perfunctory and implausible explanation of all and we find that the whole concept of alien incursion is really there as an excuse, for the lack of a better backdrop, to depict an epiphany of faith.  By treating the alien subject matter in such a lackadaisical way, they end up with a farcical movie that makes everything incredulous, including the faith plot they are trying to advance.  Moreover, it is littered with faux pas, such as a mortally injured accident victim draped on a car with perfect hair and not a speck of blood.  I would give it zero stars if I could, the only redeeming quality being the performance delivered by Joachim Phoenix.
The aliens, we are told, are ultra-sneaky, they do not want us to know that they are here, those that are already on the ground try to hide from contact and their ships even have the capability to hover over us invisibly.  Well, ok that is not unreasonable, but wait a minute, if they go to such great lengths to hide their presence why are they manually cutting huge signs all over the world for all to see?  Apparently a race with interstellar technology can't make or read maps, take terrain photos in any spectrum, nor posses any other navigation aids whether they be laser, radar, or even rudimentary infrared beacons (which makes the fact that they were able to find Earth at all in the infinity of space a miricle far exceeding Mel's).  I mean plain old 21st century earth technology aircraft can find and hit a bunker in Iraq without having to send paratroops in first to visually spray paint or make earth mounds 50 yards long saying ""This way to Saddam bunker #56,"" do we?
Then we have a crib radio intercom intercepting the alien's radio communications when the entire military/scientific community cannot.  We are told that the aliens will only fight hand to hand because if they use technology they will damage earth resources.  Considering that there are more than 6 billion people on Earth who would not have had this rule explained to them and would use any weapon at hand from ballistic missiles to bb guns to baseball bats, an invasion force of say 100,000 running around trying to catch everyone by hand must be a pretty moronic one.  But wait, if they are that moronic how have they invented space travel and we haven't?  This ridiculous premise resulted in about a quarter of the movie being devoted to terrified people holing out in a lonely wooden house with boarded up windows while the `zombies' outside milled around, banged on doors, made scary noises and poked groping hands through holes.  I use the word zombies purposely because I literally thought I was watching a remake of ""Return of the Living Dead.""  It was ridiculous.  Come on fellas, zombies are supposed to be brainless, I thought you were trying to make a sci-fi movie here.
Ok, we pull a tuft of hair out and overcome that hand-to-hand for resource thing.  But what resource? Water kills them, water is to them what sulfuric acid is to us.  Giving the movie the benefit of the doubt and ignoring contemporary scientific thought at this time that water is the necessary foundation of any life in the universe, the viewer will still be left scratching his/her (now slightly balder) head in puzzlement.  Why Earth?  Earth is water.  If they wanted rocks or minerals there's Mars and 10 billion other places.  Want humans? Humans are 70% water. Bio-matter?  ALL bio-matter on Earth is water based.  They are so afraid of water they don't even land near lakes and it isn't like standing water in lakes will just leap up at them but Earth has RAIN, mist, fog, snow, low cloud cover, dew drops in the morning, you name it.  A stray rain cloud would wipe out entire contingents in seconds including the contingent that apparently traveled a gazillion miles in the nude to bang on a lonely homestead with their fists like zombies (wait I said that already).  But I am getting ahead of myself even here.  If a quarter-glass of water can instantly burn them to the bone, Earth's atmospheric humidity factor would be high enough to get them sizzling the moment they touch down.  These things would be acceptable if they had made this movie a comedy, a spoof or just light-hearted escapism fare, but for a movie that wants to be taken seriously, they are inexcusable.  I spent the entire movie grinding my teeth.

1474669,4,B00005JL3T,"I liked M. Night Shamalyan ""Signs."" This is a very young and bright director. He's know Steven Spielberg, but he's making better movies than most directors out there.
Signs tells the story of a former revrend played by Mel Gibson who has crop circles start appearing at his home. He thinks it's mischief and tells his family not to worry about it. It ends up becoming worse and an alien invansion in obviously going to happen.
Signs has great acting. Mel Gibson plays his character to perfection. All of the characters in the movie are played well. You feel diffrently for each person in the movie and they do a great developing themselves. M. Night Shamalyan even has a cameo in the movie and he is believable.
What ""Signs"" does so well is suspense. You are on the edge of your seat the entire movie. Diffrent things will make you jump in the movie that you never would have expected.

In fact, these two performances are the main reason ""Signs"" is as effective as it is.  Gibson's scenes with the man who ran down his wife (director Shamalyan in a credible yeoman role) and with his wife who is dying are stunning and gut-wrenching.  His fight with his lack of faith is also clearly delineated by the talented Gibson.  Likewise, Phoenix's role as the younger brother is touching and convincing; only wish he didn't whisper so much.  And one has to admit the scene where Gibson finds his siblings looking like Hershey's Kisses is a howler.  But overall, the script is ambiguous enough to wonder:  why did the aliens leave so suddenly; why did only one show up at Gibson's farm?  The aliens seemed easy enough to dispatch; so why such ""horror"" around the globe?  Shamalyan's struggle for ""atmosphere"" overrides the holes in the plot and the lack of any real suspense.

1474671,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable)  Signs is an atypical invaders-from-space movie that emphasizes character and thematic development over the all-too-familiar big-budget special effects extravaganza a la Independence Day.
Instead of using huge set-piece battles with flying saucers, ray guns, and the cool-but-ineffective Earthlings' conventional forces, Shyamalan goes for the less obvious yet more chilling technique of focusing on the extraterrestrials' insidious moves and their effects on Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family.
The overall feel of Signs, which is confined to the Hess farm and a small nearby town just outside Philadelphia, is that of an above-average Stephen King adaptation.  As in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan places ordinary people (in this case, a small family of four) in an extraordinary situation, beginning with reverend-turned-corn-farmer Hess' discovery of crop circles in his fields.  At first convinced that it's all a big hoax pulled off by the local miscreants, Hess and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) witness very disturbing events on and around the farm, most of them centering on Graham's two young children.
To write more about this incredibly effective film would be criminal, especially to those reading this review who have not yet seen Signs.  It's scary, yes, but it also has scenes of warmth, humor, and even revealing insights about spirituality and science.
Signs is, ultimately, more than just a simple chiller.  It is also a clever meditation on human nature, and, more importantly, about faith, the effect of grief on one's belief system, and the redeeming power of hope.",1064707200,,1656,5.47843137254902

It's not treacle and everything in this movie leads up to the plausible ending. It's not an advertisement for religion, nor is it simplistically sentimental. The life decision made by Mel's character is well earned and based on the very scary and tragic yet miraculous things that happen before.
It's also wonderfully suspenseful and very disconcerting (in an ego-busting way!)to see really scary movie monsters that give not one whit for our little lives (none of Spielberg's cuddly aliens here), and this gives the film a depth that matches the struggles the characters are going through in their emotional lives.
Also, the kids are great! Even the tiny girl is a real character, with a serious side not usually allowed to children in films (Shayamalan seems to have a knack for respecting kid's inner lives). These kids are written and played as individuals, not cliche- spouting symbols of adult writers in love with some false notion of childhood.
Finally, my only gripe is with one short bit near the end, where we get a flashback to Mel's earlier encounter with the critter. Since the rest of the movie treats the audience as smart enough to remember the various connections between people and themes, this was unceccessary and distracting to me.",1062806400,4,1369,4.9825327510917035

However, I really did enjoy Mr. Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" and found ""Unbreakable"" OK.  So, I was prepared to give this movie a chance, but had many doubts about what it was going to be.  And I thought I had the movie pretty much figured out, but it really is only about aliens as a means to the point of the movie, which is really about the issue of faith.
There is a great deal of humor in the movie.  Who doesn't love the Hershey Kiss foil helmets?  Or the girl at the pharmacy who insists on confessing to Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) even though he reminds her firmly that he is no longer a priest.
The tragedy of Graham's wife being run over in a rather amazing accident is important to the movie in unexpected ways.  It is interesting that Mr. Shyamalan plays the poor soul who fell asleep and killed Graham's wife.  But he ends up being the vehicle of the revelation of faith.
I don't expect this movie to be everyone's cup of tea.  But I enjoyed it a great deal.  There is a lot of suspense.  The alien stuff is handled in a fresh way.  The child actors, especially Abigail Breslin, are very good. And Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Cherry Jones give very fine performances - think about them sitting around the table while Graham and Merrill try and describe what they think they saw to Officer Paski.

1474778,3,B00005JL3T,"Yes, the major complaint with this film is the whole ""aliens-water"" thing. That would be a valid complaint if the film was about an alien invasion, that was just a plot device used to explore the motivations behind Mel's character and themes about the power of faith. It succeeds on that level while providing some real suspense and excitement.

1474779,1,B00005JL3T,"To be charitable, I imagine the writer/director of this film thought he was making something suspenseful, yet subtle and delicate. In fact so much of the film is pure ""talking heads"" the biggest mystery of all is why an actor like Mel Gibson let himself be talked into taking part in such a staggeringly vacuous piece of nonsense.
There are just two story lines here, and even then they tend to occupy discrete sections of the fim rather than intertwining:
1. Mel Gibson was a priest until his wife was killed in a road accident six months before the film begins. Losing his wife caused him to lose his faith. In the final scene, apparently on the ludicrous premise that God gave his son asthma to protect him from the alien gas attack, he dresses up as a priest again.
2. Crop circles start appearing all over the planet, including one in the field of maize on Gibson's farm. Later on something big with lots of lights on appears over Mexico City. Then the earth gets invaded by aliens who are apparently intent on ""harvesting"" the human race, but are rather easily defeated because they cannot stand coming into contact with - Water!
The first question that comes to mind is: What kind of alien race, whose members are fatally allergic to water, is bright enough to travel vast distances through space, yet stupid enough to waste all that technology, time and effort by trying to harvest a race of beings whose bodies are 80% water?
Duh!
I see some reviewers reject this kind of criticism on the grounds that the film isn't really about crop circles or the alien invasion but is about beliefs, faith, family, etc.
Sorry, I don't see the logic.  Maybe I'm being naive but to my mind, if you use crop circles, aliens and an alien invasion as the hook on which to hang your story then the crop circles, the aliens and the invasion should be as credible as the other elements of the plot.
If they AREN'T worth taking trouble over then why the heck are they there at all?  Could it be that they are included in an effort to attract an audience which wouldn't be even remotely interested in the ""real"" story?
There may have been the basis for an interesting 20 minute TV programme here, but what we actually get is an hour and a half (approx.) of poorly lit (sorry, ""atmospheric""), poorly recorded (""natural""?) nonsense. The special f/x are limited in every sense of the word, involving one pretty stereotypical alien (naked, humanoid, with silvery green skin, bald head and black eyes), and a still photo of a set of bright spots over some kind of urban area at night (Mexico City? It could have been Southend-on-Sea for all you could see). In fact (to save money?) the characters end up telling us all about the invasion. It's like watching the recording of a 1930's radio drama, except that the script really isn't up to the standards of a 1930s radio drama.
As to the DVD extras, there's plenty there, but what does all that examination of a thoroughly mindless, boring picture get you? Right, more boredom.
I personally liked ""Sixth Sense"" a lot, and I appreciated the slow build up of the plot to the final explanation of Bruce Willis' situation.
Possibly Mr Shyamalan was trying to do something along the same lines here. If so, I can only say that he needs to get back some of his earlier objectivity, because this film failed to match his earlier work in every conceivable way.

His Sixth Sense scared people everywhere, and revived in the process Bruce Willis's career with gusto, while Breakaway was a very intelligent and underrated thriller with a twist. I, therefore, very much looked forward to Signs, for fresh, original, and well written and directed films are few and far between these days, and any new output by directors like Shyamalan are a valuable addition to the art of cinema.
Well, Signs did deliver the goods on many levels.
Firstly it is a very well directed film, where the pace and tension starts from the first minutes and escalates steadily until almost the end.
Secondly, the writing is superb, and I very much liked the emotional and humane element of a family trying to cope with the loss of a mother, and the father(an ex priest,played flawlessly by Mel Gibson)trying to cope with the loss of his faith as a result. This is powerful writing.
The alien invasion of earth is done very smartly, the development of which is mostly seen through the eyes of this family, trapped in their farmhouse. Not since Spielberg's Close Encounter of a Third Kind, did a film handle an alien invasion/contact so brilliantly.
Yet,why do I give the film only three marks??
I was disappointed with few elemets of the film, and if you have not seen it yet, ps don't read on, as I do not wish to spoil any surprises for you.
The last scene when we get to see the alien holding the boy,(played very well by yet another Culkin, this time it is Rory)spoiled the tension and atmosphere of the film for me.
I would have very much prefered if the image and shape of these  aliens remained firmly in the viewer's imagination, since throughout the whole film we only see shadows,or fews seconds glimpses or hear footsteps which hightens the suspense.
Moreover, the fact that the aliens in Signs are so smart they can read people's thoughts, yet they are afraid of water, the only element that can destroy them, which made me think 'Hmmm, they are not so smart after all, travelling galaxies to choose the one planet that is 70% water!!!
So while I enjoyed Signs very much, and there are few memorable and powerful scenes, it is a pity that it has these very few flaws that prevents me from giving it a classic status, one that a talented filmmaker like Shyamalan deserves.",1061683200,,2370,4.642857142857143

Major problems mdizzio? Well, there seems to be a profound use of how we say, dramatic speech. Every moment they can, Mel Gibson tells the kids some dramatic story about their birth or about life. I mean jeez, it isn't that sad or powerful, so just give it up Mel. Then you learn about his wife, the accident, and why he has this sort of thing against the lord.
The one cool part was the aliens hand, then lets go over to the stupidest part, ""swing away"". Yea, swing your bat to defeat the poison dudes or something. How they kill the alien is the most idiotic thing ever though. Who was the genius who thought of the death item? My dad came across me with a good point.

1474874,4,B00005JL3T,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!
Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is a throwback to the alien invasion pics of the 1950's. The plot certainly doesn't smack of originality. Hostile aliens invade earth, humanity is on the brink of extinction, zany humans find a way to defeat alien menace. No ""ET Phone Home"" here. These xenomorphs are purely evil.
But Shyamalan chooses not to focus on the epic, ensuing struggle between the aliens and the humanoids but focuses on a single family living on a farm in the countryside.
Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former pastor who has recently lost his wife (and his faith). Joaquin Phoenix and McCaulay's slightly more talented younger brother play his two sons. These are your main characters. Seems like any episode of ""Little House on the Prairie"" until those nasty crop circles start appearing.
Forget about the built-in morality play about faith. This is just a backdrop and an excuse for some boring ponderings about the meaning of life, faith, God etc. ""Signs"" is just a first class psychological thriller. Everything else is just the icing on the cake. The suspense is allowed to build up nicely. We don't find out at least a third of the way into the film that the aliens are hostile. In the meantime, more and more mysterious sightings are seen in the skies over various cities. All of this is revealed through the news playing on the Hess's television set. As a matter of fact, aside from a quick trip to the city, most of the film takes place in and around their old farm. This leaves you with that same sense of ""what the (heck) is going on?"" that they must feel.
There are some genuine ""bump"" moments when the aliens finally converge on the farm house. But once the ET's are revealed, they look remarkably generic, plastic. So by the time our heroes find out the alien baddies have severe hydrophobia, you may be left somewhat unsatisfied. The build up was better than the conclusion.
At this point, you might want to check out some of the extras on the DVD. Nothing remarkable but it will keep you amused for a bit.

Unfortunately, although Signs works on a visceral level, it doesn't measure up on an intellectual level to Shamalyan's previous movies.  The movie's main question - whether there's some higher plan guiding everything - is dealt with in a completely artificial way.  The ""coincidences"" that are put in to emphasize the point don't demonstrate a higher plan - they emphasize a director's plan.  It's not so amazing if seeming coincidences turn out to be meaningful, because this movie was written by a person who specifically put them in there with a purpose.  Maybe if the coincidences seemed a little more believable I'd like the movie more, but as it stands now, the movie's philosophy is too contrived.

I'll skip the plot summary and just say this: Signs is creepy. It's not slasher-film scary, it's not epic moviemaking, it's simply creepy. Shyamalan has a talent for scaring us by not scaring us, in that he shows very little. Twice you see a full alien, and both times it's blurred or dark. There are times when you'll either jump out of your seat or shrink back in it, more by what Night doesn't show you than what you see. You know you'll wet your pants if the camera pans but one inch in a certain direction. I personally love this technique, as you can see blood, gore, and murders in any other film.
Signs also has a great message to it: everything happens for a reason. People say the storyline is weak and cliche-ridden. This is true, somewhat, in that there's very little that we haven't seen before. The presentation is great, and, upon closer examination, the plot is something we've been missing in a long while: an intricate web weaved throughout the film that culminates in one tense scene at the end. You know what's going to happen, any fool can guess, but, like Shakespeare, Shyamalan focuses on the journey, not the destination.
Many people have a problem with the ending, calling it predictable, stupid, and a huge cliche. I thought this upon my first viewing, as well. However, after some thought, I saw that it is actually a great ending: it ties up the whole message of ""there are no coincidences.""

Signs is NOT good.  Shamayalan does too much of the same in this movie and it does not have the same (or better) effect of the other two of his films mentioned here.
The aliens were good.  Creepy and horrid.  That was the only good thing about this movie and their appearance got the generous 2 stars I have given here.  My apologies to Mel - even he couldn't save it.
The plot is laughable - but wry, sad laughter, because it had such potential.  It began slowly and continued to drag.  It seemed much too long and was indeed much too tedious.
I hope this Director does some soul searching.  The movie didn't do that well at the movies and the critics didn't like it.  And I am forced to agree with the critics (ugh!) this time around.

Not being a fan of the horror genre, I didn't have any interest in 'Signs' when it was released in theatres.  Most horror films, at least the few I have seen, are far too gory and dirty.
Well, I eventually did see it, and was very pleasantly surprised.  It features very little bad language or violence (I was surprised to see another reviewer describe it as 'grotesque.')
Great performances all-around by Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, etc.  The focus of the movie is less on the story and explanations, but on the experience of one family.  The aliens, surprisingly, take little prescense.  But more the fear of aliens.  Shyamalan understands that there does there can be suspense and fear without blood and gore splattering across the screen.  It's great to see a modern director who knows that violence is not needed to create fear and suspense.  I was more afraid during the final half hour of the film than I ever was while watching 'The Ring' or 'The Others (though I admit to having liked the latter alot.')  Another thing that greatly helped the film was the excellent soundtrack.  I still get chills whenever I hear the main theme.
My entire family enjoyed the film, and I have watched it several times already.  It's clean, it's scary and it's an overall excellent movie.  A rare combination in modern films.",1059955200,,1336,4.711206896551724

  We start off 'okay-ish' by finding crop circles in a field by the house and the kids and dogs behaving in a strange way. This was fine. It then goes on to the little boy being able to hear 'voices talking' on a 'walkie talkie' he's carrying. Again, fine, I guess. The father later goes to check out the field at night and after shouting that whoever's playing the trick to 'stop it' and 'you're not going to get famous' at the supposed young hooligans causing the crop circles, he turns to leave. There's some slight action as what looks like a leg is seen. He then sprints back to the house and from now on the movie drops down hill at a fast pace...
  The aliens end up being able to be hurt by water... Hello!!!!!! Water vapour in the atmosphere, and surely, they would've had contact with water by now. The ending is totally senseless and doesn't make sense. Where are all the other aliens - there were obviously loads and all we seem to get is this one little green bloke at the end. The 'hostile' creature stands still and proceeds to have the sh*t beaten out of it. Oh yeah... how 'hostile' to simply stand there...
  With the best bits in the movie being the somewhat amusing silver foil hats 'so the aliens can't read our minds' and the simply delightful footage of one wandering around at a party.
  Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen...",1059782400,3,1564,4.418118466898955
1474945,3,B00005JL3T,"Director Shyamalan is a master at building suspense and tension and keeping it interesting.  The interest in the whole crop circle thing seems to have subsided a bit but this film really dives right into it and draws the viewer in.  It's quite fascinating.  I was hooked from the beginning.  In terms of theatrics I give it a high five stars.
However, without giving the ending away I can't express my disappointment enough.  Considering his previous works, I had hoped for more, something different, something unique.  Nope.
There is a faith element that is ultimately unnecessary with Mel Gibson a priest struggling with his faith.  It's hard not to be cynical but it seems a bit forced.
Without giving the ending away, it was disappointing, opting, in my opinion, for the easy way out.

1474947,4,B00005JL3T,"At one level, Signs is just average. There are many alien invasion films out there, and this one is not all that special. It does not have the suspense of Alien. It is not nearly as scary as Invasion of the body snatchers. It lacks the sense of wonder developed in Close Encounters.
At another level, Signs is surprisingly good. This is not a film about space aliens. This is a film about faith and seeing how everything in life fits together and has purpose. Though it is not obvious from the outset why things happen the way they do, the pieces all fit together.
This is not Mel Gibson's best performance, but his acting (and that of the other actors) is good enough to make this story work. The elements that come together at the end might be a bit contrived. In retrospect, it seems like the author of this screenplay thought up the ending, and worked backwards to get it all right. It does, however, have its' moment at the end, when Graham (Gibson) figures everything out. It also has some decent suspense prior to that. Unlike most movies these days, it is not entirely predictable. This one is definitely worth watching.",1059350400,13,1128,4.534313725490196
1474948,3,B00005JL3T,"Signs (2002). Rated PG-13. Running Time: One hour, 46 mins.
Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan.

All crop circle fans might like this film.  But this film plays out like those 1950's B-films.  Some of the story reminds me of ""The War Of The Worlds"", October 30, 1938 live radio broadcast with Orson Welles.
  Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is suddenly awaken by something. he quickly checks outside his door.  Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) is suddenly awaken by a sound.  They quickly go outside to find the children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin).  They find them all right, but they also discover three crop circles in design in the cornfield.
  Graham believes the weird dysfunctional brothers down the way are making the crop circles and with Officer Carolyn Paski (Cherry Jones) they try to figure this out.  On the news, they see other crop circles have formed in England and India.
  The dog got sick and Bo has a phobia for drinking water.
  There is a group of 14 UFO's hovering over Mexico City.
  Grahma decides to go visit Ray, the town's veterinarian.  Ray (M. Night Shyamalan) was also in a car accident and when he swerved, he accidentally hit Graham's wife.
  Graham is a former reverend and has remarkable common sense, but upon visiting Ray, it has him believing all the signs.

  I like to watch M. Night Shyamalan's movies, but this one was a disappointment.

  The DVD contains a featurette that runs a total of 58 minutes, but can be broken down into six parts.  Also in the bonus section are five deleted scenes.  M. Night Shyamalan will also introduce you to a clip of his first ""creature"" experimental film ""Pictures"" he made and starred in as a boy.

1474949,4,B00005JL3T,"Despite a good, juicy plot with plenty of foot-stamping, nail-biting anxiety builders and an unsettlingly ominous feel that was present in his previous films, Shyamalan doesn't repeat the twist ending that `The Sixth Sense' became massively popular for. Instead, he takes the one thing that was concealed throughout the entire film and throws it awkwardly in front of our eyes during the `grand finale'. It's unfortunate that such a superb talent like he would let something like this slip, but...he slips. Much of the film's mystifying appeal draws from the fact that you can't see just who is causing all this ruckus down on Earth, even though we already know they're E.T.'s pals. Still, it contributes greatly to the gnawing anticipation, and makes you wonder if Shyamalan had to compromise a more head-spinning conclusion at the studio's request in order to broaden the film's commercial appeal. Nonetheless, `Signs' puts on a hellish circus that keeps eyes and minds darting back and forth across reality and utter insanity. The lengthy scenes allows the tension to rack up to almost agonizing levels, keeping your mind and your heart racing at supersonic speeds. A lackluster finish, but it's still one hell of a ride.",1058659200,2,1224,5.0945273631840795
1474950,5,B00005JL3T,"This is not the easy film it seems to be. It has an obvious, adolescent interpretation according to which it can be seen as a sort of  new version of The War of the Worlds or Independence Day, but it has also deeper levels of complexity if you understand that the ""Signs"" that really matter here are not the alien circles on the cornfields but the existential ""Signs"" of which the former are, in any case, mere metaphors. The story is a search for the ""Signs"" hinting that life is not senseless; that things, even the most unfortunate, have a reason to be so; that there is destiny, design, and, by implication, a Creator or Supreme Screenwriter of Reality. So Graham (Mel Gibson), an ex-priest who has renounced the idea that things have a sense and that there is something or someone somewhere caring for mankind, goes on discovering through a prolonged epiphany that all the apparently haphazard and unfortunate events of his life are leading eventually to a unique experience of inner and outer salvation: that his wife's death was not gratuitous, but it allowed that instant of supreme cleverness (not the senseless ranting on the edge of physical collapse, as Graham had thought until then) for his dying wife to say the words in which is hidden the key of the final salvation of the family; that his son's asthma is not a meaningless misfortune, but will save Morgan of inhaling the lethal gas of the aliens; and that the glasses of water that Bo, Graham's daughter, keeps forgetting all around the house making his father angry are in the end the true weapon for the destruction of  the alien, who cannot resist the contact of water. It is as if the screenwriter showed in the end his hidden play saying: ""for this, to eventually arrive at this ending, I've been introducing since the beginning these scenes and characters; and this very same teleology, or at least something of it, can be perceived in the life of human beings, an existence which is but another ontological level of the Universal Narrative.",1058659200,4,2016,4.708215297450425

The movie doesn't have a lot of visual effects, but scares us with the fear of the characters. When I saw this movie at the theater, I was so scared, I said to myself that it was probably the scariest movie I'd seen. The DVD doesn't have the same effect, but the movie stays the same and you are gonna see it again surely. I am not gonna talk about the story, because it could ruin the pleasure of you watching it.

1474952,3,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" has one critical flaw, to this reviewer's mind: The affect, facial expressions, photography, script, scenery, and even the aliens all reflect just one mood.
As the story opens, Mel Gibson, a recent widower, is almost beside himself with grief over the recent and tragic loss of his beloved wife. A minister who has given up the cloth in his despair, he is a near zombie--unsure who or what he is, and barely able to get through his days. His only focus is his children, a young boy and girl who exactly mirror his condition. They never smile, they never use any vocal inflection. In one truly horrifying (and quite unnecessary) scene, they even endure the sudden violent death of their dog with the same eery quiet and lack of affect.
This might work, except that in the real world, children do not react to grief as adults do, and instead of coming across as pathetic, they seem inhuman and more than a little weird. Be that as it may, they all live in a lovely farmhouse with Gibson's brother (Joaquim Phoenix), who has come to nurture the family during their time of crisis, and to lend his love and support to his big brother.
When a scary series of events, beginning with spooky crop circles in the family's cornfield, threatens to tear apart the family even more, they react with the same strange, stressed silence. We know they are all on their last nerve, but they are so removed from reality that it is hard to react to their growing fear and tension as the worst comes to pass and aliens invade the planet.
There are some scary scenes, and the photography certainly adds to the mood of utter despair and ultimate fear. But the whole thing just doesn't jell, and the ending is, to my mind, a major copout. Still, it makes for an interesting couple of hours on a boring Saturday night. Just don't expect a masterpiece.",1058140800,3,1834,4.5606060606060606

I kept on looking at my DVD ticker, waiting to get it over with! The dialogue is stupid, unecessary, and lenghty. I noticed that there were a lot of little jokes, which in my opinion, further dampened this horrifyingly bad film. I notice this is the same formula that Stephen King is using: build up the ""happiness"" of the film and then when the reader or viewer is off guard, start dropping the scary scenes; there's nothing wrong with this theorem, that's the backbone to all scary flicks, but  you need to have the right  proportions and severity in order to properly execute it.
  The aliens little encounters were not scary at all, except for when they unexpectedly pounded on the door, which is the only real scary moment in the film besides the birthday party footage.
  If you want to be really inspired watch one of those Touch By  An Angel's episode, but if you want  to be totally freaked out, don't watch this film.

While some including the Amazon reviewer of this film found it overly atmospheric and unappealing, I found it to be everything that I had hoped it would be. It has moments that will make you scream or at least jump in your seat. It has moments that will make you laugh and moments that will make you think. The idea of not showing the aliens until the last minutes(the Brazilian party notwithstanding) serves the film well for 2 reasons 1) the viewer can imagine whatever they want and 2) makes the film more than a creature flick because one realizes at the end that the film wasn't about aliens but the loss and regaining of faith for one man.

(This movie is NOT as good as the Sixth Sense)
It would have been better as a sheer alien horror movie, however as it is, this is a movie to rent, not buy.",1057363200,,547,4.300970873786408
1475028,2,B00005JL3T,"After the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" writer/director M. Night Shyamalan would forge ahead with another film, this time starring Mel Gibson and a plot revolving around an alien invasion.  Mr. Shyamalan also threw in one's test of faith, as Gibson must confront his own faith (he used to be a minister) and how he deals with this invasion.  What could've been intriguing story (which it does interesting at face value) is muddled and often silly throughout the film.
A shame, because Mr. Shyamalan is a superb director.  By watching this film, however, you wouldn't agree with that statement.  Sure, it has atmosphere, but that's about it.  The story is filled with loopholes and silly plot points that could house many elephants.
I tried SO HARD to like this film, really.  But after the first twenty minutes, you know it's over.  The aliens themselves are ridiculous and seem to have no reason for jumping on people's homes late at night/early in the morning or for invading the earth to begin with!  What's more, their hind legs can kick them ten feet in the air, but can they logically kick a wooden pantry door down? EH!  Nope.  Also, the aliens are weak to water, yet the earth is over 70% comprised of water and it's EVEN IN OUR OWN ATMOSPHERE.  Somehow, they're able to walk around without the protection of space suits.  In fact, the climax isn't that great at all; somehow his dead wife's last words (""Swing Away, Merril"") had to do with the invasion and that gave Joaquin, a former league baseball player, the initiative to SWING AWAY at the alien!  WOW!  GREAT plot device... NOT.  Where's the logic in this??  Wait, ""nevermind rational explanation... they're ALIENS"" (credit: maddox.xmission.com).
Mel Gibson is superb in this and so is Joaquin Pheonix as his brother, but the rest of the cast is rather lackluster.  Rory Culkin is ANNOYING throughout the whole damn film, especially with his emotionless babbling about invasion (oh yeah, they figured out it was an invasion after reading an old sci-fi book... don't ask).
Most importantly, it fails to actually scare or thought-provoke me.  The only intense scene was when Gibson's yelling at his family at the dinner table because he didn't want to pray.  Yes, there were no aliens involved.
Overall, this is such a WASTED chance.  Not many films actually utilize God into a story and here's where I appreciated it (the fact that God is primarily involved in how things happen, etc.).  Unfortunately, the film is such a dud and even worse because of Mr. Shyamalan's talents; he could've made this better, really.  Unlike the exquisite shots from ""Sixth Sense,"" the camera shots here were insanely, unnecessarily bad.  Normally, I tolerate a film on its own merits, but the bad points stack pretty high for this movie.

1475031,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is one of the best SF movies of recent years, placing interesting theophilosophical discussion against the backdrop of a ""War of the Worlds""-esque alien invasion.
To a wider audience, the film's central premise of chance versus design may seem at times a little preachy - it's perhaps a bit too esoteric for what most people see as a straight SF flick. Shyamalan does, however, display a talent for interweaving the various elements that go towards proving his point in the movie's last ten or so minutes... although the place where the ""battle first turned"" is possibly a wee bit too obvious.
In addition to - or perhaps despite of - this, the movie succeeds as a cleverly worked appropriation of Wells' classic ""The War of the Worlds"" As with the original text, we see the invasion through the eyes of an essentially normal person, which helps to bring the reality home. The cellar, the aliens' offensive mechanism and their purpose on Earth - all of these are based on Wells' novel and, in keeping with fashionable postmodernism, Joaquin Phoenix even says at one point ""It's just like War of the Worlds""
As a piece of cinematography, the movie is brilliant at keeping its audience terrified. I will have to admit that I had a very sleepless night after I had seen it, such is its power to shock you - although admittedly, this is more ""monster jumping out of your cupboard"" horror than any intellectual scares.

1475032,5,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is,undobtedly, one of the most misunderstood films in recent memory. It is also one of the most brilliantly conceived and executed films in many a year. The heart of the movie lies NOT with the outward ET invasion, but with the father's inward crisis of faith.
The film asks the the timeless and difficult question that philosophers and theologians have asked for centuries. Is the world is just a hodgepodge of chance and coincidence, and therefore, meaningless, or is the universe guided by some metaphysical force, implying a purpose to everything that happens. Are we on our own, at the mercy of a cruel and unjust universe, or is there someone looking out for our welfare?
The director uses the alien theme to create a suspeneseful scenario ala Hitchcock, but infuses it with a profound, underlying structure ala Ingmar Bergman. He also throws in mystical elements such as the healing and life giving power of water ala director Tom Tykwer (of ""The Princess and the Warrior"" fame). The many layers produce a complex and thought-provoking film that should not be missed.",1056326400,4,1082,4.950549450549451

The dialogue in this movie is ridiculous (Mel's baseball playing kid brother talks for at least two minutes, in a serious tone, about how he believes in miracles because in some past situation he happened to have gum in his mouth which spared him from getting vomited on by a girl he was about to kiss).  I laughed (heartily) in spots that should deserve no laughter i.e. when the female cop (Caroline maybe?) informs Father Gibson that his wife is pinned against a tree in such a way that allows her to remain coherent.  The storyline for this movie was entirely predictable, especially the reaffirmation of God's plan or whatever.  Such a plan was about as shoddy as the script for this movie.
The only payoff in this movie whatsoever is the visual representation of the aliens.  Actually, any discussion of the aliens at all was pleasant compared to the slow moving, emotional family situations.  Unfortunately, the aliens take a back seat to how the family copes with all the misfortune thrown their way.

It's about characters that you come to know and care about. That is what makes it a great movie. Great movies are about characters, NOT special effects. Anyway, what I love about this film is the humor that comes from the supporting characters, and it has a sweet and beautiful little girl in it. Abigail Breslin, as Bo Hess, is the kind of little girl you'd love to have as your own. She's so adorable and hilarious, and she pulled my heartstrings at the right moments.

1475135,1,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan, the shining new writer/director of the overrated The Sixth Sense and the underrated Unbreakable, had us going all summer long.  He had marketing with crop circles and slogans like Its Happening.  Signs grossed $60 million in its opening weekend.  Up to the opener, I was looking forward to Signs.  Its about time Hollywood makes a movie about crop circles (because whether or not you like to believe in UFOs, these strange shapes appearing in farmers crops overnight, are supposedly being reported). Thats what I thought, until I got an hour into the film.
The first forty-five minutes of the film is the best filmmaking ever made.  It starts out in an abnormal morning, in which family man Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), finds crop circles in his crops.  From there, the story gets kind of suspenseful, in terms of the way the direction of the film goes. The plot seemed too much like Daphne Du Mauriers original story of The Birds (which Alfred Hitchcock took and changed around to make his own version)
From there, I got thrown away.  The whole crop circles angle was very pointless to the ending of the film, not to give anything away to those who hasn't seen it.  Picture this: you're an alien that is afraid of water, yet you are about to raid a planet that is two-thirds water.
The few compliments I do give to the film are Mel Gibson, for his choice of picking such a different project.  This doesnt go along with the freedom, kicking butt Brave-Heart, the wholesome melo-drama The Man Without a Face, nor the epic saga Lethal Weapon.  I will also give two thumbs up to the score of the film.  James Newton Howard didn't make the film too bad with the haunting music, that is compared to how John Williams approached Steven Spielbergs Close Encounters and E.T., the beautiful yet undeniable creepy score, moves the film along.
As for this uprising writer/director, Mr. Shyamalan is the new kid on the block who does have talent for directing a film.  In his films, I saw some camera angles on both Unbreakable and now, Signs, which I had never seen before.  But as for screenwriting, he should have somebody else write out the scripts for him.  Hes decent on character development, needs work on dialog, and certainly is horribly in terms of plots and sub-plots.
What I hear from the rumor-mill, Signs is going to be a trilogy.  Whether or not good old Mel will rejoin this already gone bad series, Signs could have been done much better.  And adding the fear factor of crop circles does not help.  Even though this wasn't a clich in your face, blow up the world type sci-fi flick, it still runs with War of the Worlds and Independence Day, with the misconceptions of UFOs, whether you believe or not, the truth is out there.",1055548800,2,2748,4.63298969072165

I only gave it 2 stars on the account of Mel Gibson being in the movie or else this movie...would suck even more!,1055462400,,443,4.127906976744186
1475138,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is a unique and powerful sci-fi thriller.  Fans of The Sixth Sense and The Others should enjoy this film though it doesn't have ghosts or a surprise ending.  Signs is subtle in its creepiness and grand in emotion.  The relationship between Mel Gibson's character and his children is touching, and the idea of having faith is something to take to heart.  Signs is a simple yet ambitious movie that focuses more on personal relationships and drama.  We don't see hoards of aliens or spacecraft, laser blasts or explosions.  Instead, we see a family struggling to survive and stay strong.  Though some of premise of the film is a little far-fetched, it still feels frighteningly real.",1055116800,6,708,4.899159663865547
1475139,3,B00005JL3T,"Well, this is not a bad movie. I've seen many worse films in my life, actually I'd give it a 3.5 stars, but then I've got lots of complaints about this.
Let's start with the good things though. Mel Gibson's play is very good and authentic, his little girl is really sweet, and the movie has managed to scare me a few times, although its not a horror film in any way.
The biggest problem I have with it is the storyline. Its just too damn simple. The movie follows the same 4 characters (father, brother, and two children) through the entire movie, and in barely two different locations. Aside from them, there are barely two or three other characters.
There are quite a few hints and metaphors throughout, but they barely serve any purpose. Little girl, Bo, won't drink any glass of water that was left out for a few minutes, consistantly throughout the movie. But what does this contribute to the movie? absolutely nothing. Other totally illogical things would be the alien trying to break inside their home using convensional 'everyday human' ways, failing, and at the end being beaten by a baseball bat!!!
And nope, I'm not ruining you the movie, its just too bad to be seen. One of the other things I didn't like is that at the peak of the action, when the family struggles from keeping the alien out of their room, the father starts saying cheesy bs to his children in order to cool them down. This might be helpful in some situations, but those idiotic dialogues could wait for other scenarios, when everything is ok, for example.
The end of the movie leaves many things to be desired. It looks as if the movie just had to end (it did, it reached nearly 100 minutes), so the director decided to let the aliens leave the planet and let the movie end... When the movie was over I tought to myself 'Alright, but what the hell did I learn for this?'.
A nice scene throughout the movie would be when the family is eating the dinner Gibson made for them. I think this is quite an exciting scene, not worth watching the movie for, but if you've already watched it you should appreciate the excellent playing (especially by Gibson).
As for the DVD itself, the video quality is superb, widescreen anamorphic but only 16:9 (don't know 'bout you but I hate 1:2.35 movies). The colors are vibrant and the scenes are live and colorful. While the sound is limited to DD, instead of DTS, I haven't noticed any letdown. Surround sound is used very well, and the mix is of high quality. The added features are quite standard for today's DVDs. I haven't checked them out, so I can't say much about it.
All in all, its not worth buying, but if you get this as a present or so, keep it. It has a few bright spots.",1054944000,,2699,4.443548387096774

This movie was brilliantly shot.  M. Night Shyamalan captures the sets beautifully, and makes this movie chilling and scary.  The movie was genuinely scary, and didn't need special effects to make me scared.  I watched it and was chilled.  The acting was sometimes a little over-the-top, but it was still good.  The children were chilling, and Gibson does a good job.  The story had its holes but was still a chilling and good story.

I screamed by head off (along with the rest of the theater audience) at the jumpy scenes and felt like I really got to know the characters.
As fantastic as I thought it was at first? No. The ending was not spectacular at all....really didn't make a lot of sense, and the sense that it did make it still seemed....silly.

Signs is a movie about a priest that's lost his faith with a side-plot about an alien invasion. The movie is slow which wouldn't have been a probleem if the side-plot didn't lead me to believe that more exciting thing's are about to happen. They don't. At the end all characters have some sort of Owen Meany type characteristic that's supposed to make the movie real smart. It doesn't.
For me the movie would've been better if the whole alien invasion thing was just kept as a background layer and not much more.
The acting by Mel Gibson is solid.
The alien looks terrible (probably because budget was not allocated, because of the undecidedness what to make this movie)
Go watch a better movie.",1054771200,2,922,4.628048780487805
1475241,5,B00005JL3T,"I saw Signs just a few days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it.  This is quality film making, and I think the general populace has forgotten what that is.  M. Night Shyamalan is a breath of fresh air; a hands-on film maker/storyteller.  His direction reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock.  He has the confidence in us, the viewers, to allow our imagination some well-deserved exercise.  Hollywood has patronized our intellect; we've been spoon-fed blood and guts for so long now that we don't know how to fill in the blanks anymore . . .
Before seeing Signs, I did not know anything about the story other than it was a test of one man who had lost Faith and that it had to do with crop circles and the fact they may have been created by aliens.  I was hesitant to see it because I thought ""crop circles, how lame!"".  I will now admit I was extremely touched by the story.  I was so sucked into the movie that I never gave the hokey premise a second thought.  It unfolded, neatly yet surreally, for me as I discovered what the characters were discovering.  My husband, who saw this movie in the theater some time ago, was kind enough not to give me any additional information other than what I had seen in the trailers and I will extend that courtesy to you.  For this film, it is better not to know too much.

On a technical note, the acting was terrific - - I fully believed in each of the characters, and their roles were adequately developed to the extent necessary.  The children were wonderful actors, as was Joaquin Phoenix and, of course, Mel Gibson.
As a mother of four, I was completely at ease sitting beside my children watching this film.  No uncomfortable sex scenes, no uncomfortable language.  I remember being impressed by some of the dialogue, realizing that people don't do that in movies anymore - - sit and talk in complete sentences without stuff exploding behind them - - talking for the sake of revealing their characters, their relationships, their motivations, the story.  That's not to say this movie is not scary - - my children are between the ages of 3 and 12 (the 3  yr old twins played in their room because the opening music was too scary for their taste), and they are all comfortable with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and other ""high-brow"" horror like Sam Raimi's ""Army of Darkness"", so the scary parts of this movie - - and there are some intense situations - - were not too much for them.  It could be too scary for other children, though.
While I love to be entertained by a film, even scared by a film, I mostly enjoy being made to think after a film.  This is a wonderful story about Faith.  We have all wondered why bad things happen, and we've all heard the cliches - - when one door closes, another opens - - only God knows - - etc. - - and I think Mr. Shyamalan has given us a tale that is entertaining, suspenseful, well-crafted, visually pleasing, and good old-fashioned fun!  It is not often that I believe a film will be a classic but I do believe Signs will stand the test of timelessness.",1054598400,,3039,4.410394265232975
1475242,3,B00005JL3T,"... and I do not like it...
As a matter of fact, it could have been better if they carried the aliens-on-the-attack theme forward through the whole movie. But, for some reason, the producers felt that a family conflict would help the appreciation of the aliens somehow. Interestingly, in one of the climax scenes, Mel Gibson, instead of thinking of what to do against the alien, remembers his last conversation with his wife... Some things just do not make any sense.
The movie is basically about the strange events taking place in the numerous different places of the world. And one of these places is a small county in east Pennsylvania, hosting the family of Mel Gibson, an old preacher. He has two little children, who are really weird, in that one reads science books despite his little age, whereas one never drinks from the same glass she has drunk just before. As the family discovers the perfectly circular shaped cropped areas in their farm, they call the police. But, the next day, they realize it's not just them. The whole family gathers before the television. The rest of the movie is about their waiting for the aliens to come to their house again, to confront them. But, I must say, the confrontation is not worth seeing.
I wouldn't call this movie a thriller. See 'The Silence of the Lambs', or 'Psycho', or, I don't know, 'The Shining', if you want to get thrilled in the real sense. Or, if you're a Mel Gibson fan, see 'Conspiracy Theory'; but no, not 'Signs'.",1054512000,,1479,4.648854961832061

1475244,2,B00005JL3T,"This is a huge let down from ""The Sixth Sense"" for M. Nite Shama Lama Ding Dong. This, quite simply, was not a good movie.  The acting was subpar, dialogue was weak and using crop circles really didn't create a whole lot of intrigue.  The behaviors of the children were boring and predictable.  The movie does an average job of creating the need to see the aliens, but when we actually see them, it was as disappointing as the rest of the movie.  Do yourself a favor, see the ""Sixth Sense"" for a second time, rather than this underachieving mistake.",1054080000,2,549,4.46

I understand it wasn't a horror movie and was simply supposed to be about the 'signs' of an invasion, not actually about the invasion. But after awhile it stopped being suspensful and just became very dry and boring. And the ending left MUCH to be desired. It had its good moments, but Im glad I only rented it instead of buying. It just wasn't that noteworthy.",1053993600,2,512,4.457446808510638
1475246,5,B00005JL3T,"I must be in the minority, but I loved Signs not for it's chilling suspense(which I enjoyed to), but for the film's symbolic message that came at the end. But if you're the type of person who would rather watch a horror/slasher movie, this would probably disappoint you. Signs doesn't really have much violence, albeit a couple scenes of a guy attacking a creature with a bat and a dog getting impaled by a barbecue fork etc., but don't be expecting anything like the Chucky movies. What drives the film is it's many 'suspenseful' moments, where the movie builds you up so you expect something scary to happen.
 It was also an ingenius idea to make the setting in a country-esque area, not only so the crop circles could appear, but for the feeling that the family is in the middle of nowhere, and there's not much places to run to, except the house. The only thing about Signs that I didn't like was the whole thing with M. Night Shyamalan in the role of the guy who killed the main character's wife. It was kinda distracting; when he made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense he wasn't as distracting because he only played a very small role and didn't appear often, but maybe it's just me.
The Signs DVD isn't filled with extras; just the French language track with captions and some Making Of feature. And there's an unintentionally funny bonus called 'Night's First Creature Film' which features M. Night when he was a kid. Either than that, there's just some storyboards. Anyway, if you liked films like The Sixth Sense and The Others, there's a good chance you'l enjoy Signs.

1475247,2,B00005JL3T,"I can probably save all of us a great deal of time by saying that Signs proved to be a little weak in just about every way.  The extraordinary nature of the subject matter left the film at risk to begin with.  The plot consists of numerous little hints and threads that are fed to us in an incomplete manner, and then tied up conveniently in a flurry of Hollywood convention and cliche.  The subject matter far oversteps itself, without pausing long enough to provide ample justification for why we should even follow it along for the ride.
The story itself takes place almost entirely on an individual farmplace, with a minimal number of characters, who are forced to come to terms with events that are taking place across the entire world ~ a world which the characters never engage any sort of relationship with apart from television broadcasts which are meant to convey that sort of 9-11-ish fascination.  This was unconvincing at best, bloated Hollywood laziness at worst.

Everything was supposed to support the belief in signs and portents and that everything happens for a divine reason, but there are so many huge logical holes that the intended effect was lost. The message I got from this movie is that god wanted Mel Gibson, his children and brother to survive an alien invasion. This meant that even Mel Gibsons wife had to die to deliver some cheesy prophecy with her dying breath so that an alien could be defeated with a baseball bat and some glasses of water. Also, apparently these aliens we smart enough to build space ships that could travel between the stars, but not smart enough to understand a door knob.

This is a film that works mostly off of subtleties, and the disc lends itself well to that.  The anamorphic video on the disc is top-notch, especially in dark scenes where detail is vivid.  The soundtrack has also transferred well, allowing the dynamic sound effects and score to come through beautifully and clearly in both its loudest and most quiet moments.
Extras are less than spectacular.  The ""making of"" featurette seems to be a promotional special that probably aired just before or during the film's theater run.  There are some extra scenes, but not much was cut that was too different from what we saw.  As always, the director included one of his early short films that is somewhat releated to the main feature on the disc.  In all, the disc is pretty skimpy on extras.

This is one extremely terrifying movie - right up until the very end...and then it all falls apart.  Oh, well, most of it scared me silly and, in an age where so little generally does, what more can I say?
Transfer wise: A really good-looking visual experience with rich colors, deep blacks, fine detail (even during the darkest scenes) and exceptional contrast levels.  The over all visual experience is generally smooth with edge enhancement only occasionally present.  Film grain is also strong at times, but nothing terribly distracting.  Audio - a disturbingly potent 5.1 mix that really bumps up the terror level.  Extras: a featurette and some audio commentary stuff.  Toss away, mostly and not really up to par with the other ""Vista Series"" extras featured on other discs in this DVD line from Buena Vista.
BOTTOM LINE: Up until the last 15 minutes, this is one frightening thrill ride of a movie - like riding through a funhouse when you're five years old. The transfer is consistent, throughout.",1052524800,2,1359,4.852813852813853

As the movie starts out, Mel Gibson gives an effective performance as a man who's lost his wife and a minister who's lost his faith. Very strong performances from Joaquin Phoenix and the children give the film a very strong family orientation.
This isn't a blood-and-guts movie and there's only a few acts of violence committed during the film.  Surprisingly, there's very little profanity.  Still - the subject matter will certainly upset small children.

1475357,4,B00005JL3T,"The plot is interesting enough, though eventually it becomes redolent of ""War of the Worlds.""  Crop circles mysteriously appear over an individual's town, and as it all develops they don't appear to be caused by humans, and the circles appear to be a prelude of something far more terrifying to come.

Mel Gibson plays an excellent and convincing performance for his role.  He plays an ex-pastor who lost faith after his wife died.  Ray Culkin is, understandably, reminiscent of a young Macaulay Culkin in several visible ways, except here he plays a character with a far more depressed and solemn attitude.  Like what Hitchcock did in his films, M. Night Shyamalan plays a comparatively minor character (try to spot him).

For the most part the characters have an emotionless, quiet and almost lethargic speaking pattern, which creates a mood and atmosphere similar to what one would see in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" accentuated further by the lighting and occasional music.  Commendably, Shyamalan's methods to evoke frightful suspense are done well psychologically as opposed to inundating us with small bloodbaths, making it a more intelligent movie. The ""signs,"" from which the movie takes its title, are apparently not about the signs of the mysterious forces behind crop circles, but goes beyond that into the fabric of happenings in our daily world and to what it intriguingly suggests.  This principle as a plot element is utilized rather well in some of the closing scenes of the movie.

Surprisingly, there are some occasional bits of humor inserted in the movie, though the movie is largely in a spooky suspense genre rather than a hardcore thriller.  The first half of the movie is relatively slow moving, to the extent that one might get almost impatient with the unfolding of the plot.  Near the close of the movie, however, things get quite suspenseful and one becomes eager and uncertain as to how things turn out.  The ending skillfully ties several plot elements together beautifully, and the close of it all is satisfying (though I won't say if it's a happy or sad ending).  All things considered, it is a good movie for those who don't mind these kinds of movies (occasionally slow moving, suspenseful, and the type of atmosphere that permeates the film).

Then the plot starts getting soggy, and the silly background story all falls into place, leaving you thoroughly dissapointed.

Hitchcock said less is more and Shyamalan plays off of that, attempting to invoke subtlety with a nod to camp suspense conventions of a prior era, but somehow he manages to be incredibly heavy-handed with the sparse bit of content he's working with.

I have read that it was ""B"" movie with ""A"" actors and it was just a variation of War of the Worlds, but I disagree.  While it did seem to take a couple of themes from a couple of different movies it still stands alone as an original thriller.  I feel it is worth watching and buying.",1051315200,,473,4.043010752688172
1475492,2,B00005JL3T,"Honestly, this movie has some terrific acting.  All the characters are relatively well-rounded, Mel Gibson is at his best, and the director does a good job of building suspense and creating an emotional tie between the characters and the audience.
However, as is often the case in Hollywood productions, there's a major flaw that destroyed the movie for me.  Water is toxic to the aliens.  So just what is a superior race of aliens doing on a planet covered with a highly toxic substance without any sort of protective suits?  If they are intelligent enough for interstellar space travel, why didn't they manage to notice that the majority of the surface is covered in water?  Didn't they see the cloud formations of water vapor from orbit?  What about the rain?  If humans were visiting a planet covered in hydrochloric acid, I can guarantee that we would be wearing something to protect ourselves from it.
More examples: Anybody who has actually been in a cornfield knows that before dawn, they are drenched in dew.  So the aliens were running through (highly toxic) water all the time.  Blood has a high percentage of water in it, so any time an alien clawed a human, it was covering its hands / claws with (highly toxic) water.  And surely the high humidity of many regions must have been at least mildly irritating to them...
It's really too bad the movie's resolution was based upon such a flawed concept, as once again the acting was quite good.  If only the directors had hired a science consultant or had at least taken a few minutes to think through the logic of their choices.  If you view this movie as a psychological suspense / character movie, it's quite enjoyable though.",1051228800,6,1687,4.720136518771331
1475493,3,B00005JL3T,"First, as a movie, ""Signs"" is only so-so. Despite great acting - especially from Mel Gibson - a handful of extraordinarily tense scenes skillfully wrought by director M. Night Shyamalan, and an exploration into the existence of God, ""Signs"" is pretty silly.
Occasionally the dialog works, but most of the time it sounds like the pretentious script from a post-modern adaptation of a Greek play. Stilted. Monosyllabic. Bad. Also, Shyamalan's cameo in the flick is totally pretentious, and he exhibits the charisma of a two-by-four during his scenes. It's a shame he stole the part from some deserving professional, probably some guy looking for his big break. But it's Shyamalan's bat and ball, and he'll play shortstop if he wants.
Then there's the whole premise of the movie. Alien invasion? As instrument to test an ex-preacher's faith? Talk about going overboard. Why couldn't God settle for a plague of locusts, a run of bad luck, or even your run-of-the-mill serial killer? But now I'm getting into my next topic...
God. Faith. This is what ""Signs"" explores. It turns out in the movie that the whole alien invasion, the son's asthma, and the wife's gruesome death was just an intricate plot by God to test Mel Gibson's faith. (Well, the preacher Gibson plays.)
?
But...let's face facts. The actual, real, living, breathing God (whatever she looks like) did not make this film. M. Night Shyamalan did. He wrote the script, he created the characters, he framed the scenes, shot the shots. It's his universe, message, and plot. You get the feeling, though, that Shyamalan feels he's actually framing theological ideas or debates. Maybe even that he's channeling divinity by using his creative process (he wouldn't be the first artist to believe this). The earnestness of the movie underscores this point. In any case, it seems obvious that Shyamalan's spirituality seeps throughout this flick.
In the end, it's an easy kind of spirituality. God reveals himself in a devious set of interrelated coincidences and saves everybody. There are no uneasy questions that linger past the closing credits. Happy, happy. But the drama unfolding outside the theaters is much more convincing for me. And confusing.",1051142400,4,2203,5.088397790055248
1475494,5,B00005JL3T,"I was a fool and didn't go see Signs in the theater. People kept telling me how great the movie was and that I should really go and see it. Being strapped for cash (my usual state) and having been unimpressed with The Sixth Sense, I decided not to.
Big Mistake...
Signs is the best movie I have yet seen from 2002. I don't think anything else that I haven't seen could possibly top it. I now own it.
I'm not writing this review just to throw my cent and a half worth into the discussion. Instead, if you are reading this, I am writing to earnestly urge you to see this film. Signs is easily one of the best movies of the past decade.
I've heard it described as a B movie by others. Maybe it has some stock characters and maybe it is very stylistic--but who cares? When a story moves you-isn't that the point of all art that has meaning?
And this story moves.
As for details: This DVD does not have commentary, but the featurettes form a kind of commentary and are more worthwhile than the kind you usually get on DVDs. The menu page is great. The audio is suitably creepy.
You don't know me and I don't know you, but take my word on this movie. Get it. You won't be sorry.",1050969600,2,1172,4.144736842105263
1475495,4,B00005JL3T,"Yes, I've heard the good, the bad, and the ugly about SIGNS.
Yes, I could label Shyamalan as a prima donna for writing, directing, producing, *and* acting in his own movie.
Yes, I could be disappointed in the script for its lapses in logic.
And yes, I could also very much enjoy this movie for what it is - an extension of some of the classic TV shows from the 60's, most notably THE OUTER LIMITS. There's even more Joseph Stefano here than Alfred Hitchcock - the only thing missing is the control voice!",1050364800,,504,4.372340425531915
1475496,5,B00005JL3T,"I have to admit I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films.  I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was excellent, and despite the panning it got, I thought ""Unbreakable"" was pretty good too.  I got ""Signs"" out with trepidation; I'm not exactly an ""Alien"" movie type of fan though I do watch them.
However in this case I will make an exception to the rule.  What a fantastic little film is all I can say.  And oh boy, what heart stopping moments there are from beginning to end.
Don't rent this if you want gratuitous violence and bodies all over the place, this isn't that kind of movie.  What it does do is play with your head big time.  A series of crop circles are appearing all over the world and one of them has just turned up in a small field belonging to an ex-Pastor who is going through a crisis of faith.
M. Night Shyamalan choose a good cast with Mel Gibson (Graham Hess) excelling as the Pastor who has lost his faith in God after the accidental death of his wife in a freak car crash.  The two child characters (Hess's young children) are equally good, with Rory Culkin (Morgan Hess) proving that he is as good as his famous older brother when it comes to acting.  Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess) does justice to her role as little girl who has an odd phobia about water, a phobia that just might help save her and her family.
However out of all these excellent people for me by far the best was Joaquin Phoenix (Merrill Hess) who plays Gibson's much younger brother, a failed baseball player with a quirky habit of striking out because of his love of ""swinging"" the bat too much.
The move starts off as a patchwork quilt of ideas that are slowly pulled together to create a creepy story about the invasion of earth, and the concept that somehow things happen for a reason, not matter how terrible they might be.  A surprise for me was how good an actor M. Night Shyamalan is.  He had a bit part as the Vet who accidentally killed Gibson's wife in the car accident and who gave me one of two great giggles in a film with few laughs.  Just as he about to flee to a place near water, he tells Gibson ""not to go into his pantry"" because one of ""them"" (the Aliens) is locked in their.  He does it with such a dead pan expression that I had to laugh out loud.  The next excellent giggle is when Gibson comes home (after his pantry experience) to find his two children and younger brother sitting on the sofa, all with aluminium foil hats on their heads, ""So that Aliens won't hear their thoughts,"" I howled at that, it was so comical and yet you could understand and even feel their desperation as they tried to understand what was happening to them and the world.
The tension in the film builds up, M. Night Shyamalan doesn't let you glimpse the Aliens too often, all you get is a ""feel"" of them in the beginning but as the film gathers momentum you become more and more aware of them and their hostile presence.  There is a neat twist in this film that is at first subtle then as the answers dawn on you it becomes obvious.  I won't spoil it for you but this is cracking good film.
Just remember, it has little violence on show that is left to your imagination instead it relies on playing tricks on your mind.
I really enjoyed this film, and it made me jump on several occasions.  Worth renting and watching with the lights off...if you're brave enough....",1050105600,,3345,4.311004784688995

He brings an alien invasion to life and that is what makes it so scary...it seems real. I enjoy watching horror movies, but rarely are there any that are worth a second viewing. But Signs, while it is not really horror more suspense, is definitely worth more than one viewing.

The movies rating was probably more like a PG rather than a Pg-13. It seems that it was just rated pg-13 because of some intense parts and only a couple of profanity words.

1475597,4,B00005JL3T,"Not many young directors are as talented with the camera as M. Night Shymalan. This is his third major studio movie and also his best. Signs does not deal as much with crop circles as much as how one family deals with crop circles. This may sound confusing, but this film is built on such a genuinely simple concept that the viewer does not have to think too hard.
Graham Hess is a former priest who lost his faith when his wife was killed in a tragic accident. His family is slowly growing apart and to add to the tension, an enormous crop circle appears on his land. Terrifying events start occurring throughout the world and Graham's awkward structure of a family begins to fall apart.

On the other hand, the side story about the minister who lost his wife, and thus loses his ""faith,"" I thought was really cheesy.  Not only has it been done before, but it took away from any credibility this movie otherwise would have had.  Decent movie, but disappointing in the long run.",1048723200,,536,4.484536082474227
1475600,5,B00005JL3T,"The only problem, and it's a small one, is that I wish there would have been more scenes with ""the monsters"", if this would be called a ""monster"" movie.  That way the very slight ""squirm factor"" with the kids would be reduced.  But even the kids got into this one a lot more than I thought they would, considering the adult level the movie was shot at.
This is a difficult achievement for a movie that works on a lot of levels.  Yes, you can call it a ""monster"" film.  And you could call it a ""space alien"" film.  And you could call it a mystery, as we are not sure what we are seeing until well into the story.  With just this alone, the movie would have been fairly decent.
But there are a couple more factors that make it great.  First is the subtle way you see how people react when they believe they are in their last days, and even their last hours of life.  One would expect a lot of scenes of mass hysteria and panic, and in the real world, there probably would be a lot of it.  This movie chooses to take the path that some people would face their maker in a quiet, loving manner.
Finally, it's great because we see Mel Gibson's battle with his own faith.  He plays a minister who's wife was taken away in a tragic accident.  He has a problem with God because of this, and at the start of the film, he is ""officially"" not to be called ""Father"" anymore, which the whole town conveniently ignores.  However, with yet more tragedy looming over more of his loved ones, where will his faith go now?  To find out, tune into what is a very, very fine film.",1048636800,,1558,4.170568561872909
1475601,5,B00005JL3T,"After the huge success - critically and commercially - of ""The Sixth Sense,"" director M. Night Shyamalan had a tough act to follow up. He failed with ""Unbreakable,"" which I feel was an average film at best, but with his latest release, ""Signs,"" he surpasses almost everyone's expectations in producing not only his best film to date, but definitely one of the highlights of 2002. As soon as a film receives huge success and makes hundreds of millions the world over, people are always there waiting to criticise. This fact stands the same with Signs; the film grossed a staggering $110 million in its first two weeks of release in the US alone, and in my opinion was well deserved. There aren't many films that deal with the subject of a sci-fi storyline, along with faith and religion, but Signs does - and to excellent effect...

Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He used to be a vicar, until six months ago when his wife, Colleen, tragically died in a car crash. He lost all faith in the church and abandoned his beliefs. He now lives with his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). Graham awakes one morning to find huge crop circles in his cornfields. He soon discovers he is not alone in all this; many more crop circles are discovered all over the world. The spontaneous reaction from the majority of the world is that aliens have finally visited us. Graham begs to differ. He acts very laid-back in front of his children, but deep down he knows that something isn't right. He wants answers. And he knows they'll come...soon. Over the course of the next few days, all his beliefs, fears and wishes will come true - with some life-changing and shocking results.

The acting in Signs is absolutely first-rate. Mel Gibson is outstanding in his role as a confused and upset father of two, struggling to live without the presence of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest rising stars in Hollywood of the past few years, and I predict big things for him the future; he was superb in Gladiator and is even better in Signs. The success of his portrayal is that Phoenix finds the core of his character and plays upon it to brilliant effect. His on-screen relationship with his brother is very believable, and gives the film a more credible stamp overall. Rory Culkin is also brilliant as little Morgan, with his asthma problem. Culkin is mature beyond his years in Signs, and the portrayal is reflected in Morgan's adult flare. Culkin is slowly but surely following in his older brothers footsteps. He may never reach the crazed popularity and worldwide idolism that Macaulay did with the Home Alone movies, but he'll be big. Agibail Breslin is another superb young actress in Signs, and definitely one of the main reasons why I love the film so much. She instantly reminds me of the young Carol Anne in The Poltergeist. Her acting ability is superb for such a young age - only bettered by Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense."" There are also very professional acting moments from Cherry Jones as Officer Paski. Her wisecrack jokes at the start of the film are replaced with more serious and outstanding emotional moments. Director M. Night Shyamalan also has a role as Ray Reddy, the other person who was in the car with Graham's wife when it crashed. He survived. She didn't. Cue hatred from Graham between the two.

There are so many brilliant scenes in Signs that make is such a unique film. The scene where Graham goes out in the middle of the night with his flashlight to investigate rustling in his cornfields (as if you would!) is just a classic - the leg that disappears into the crops is very creepy and his reaction is even more astonishing. There are also some brilliant TV scenes. The scenes where many bright lights are seen hovering over Mexico City and the birthday party scene in Brazil are just incredibly spooky - especially the latter. Imagine walking down an alley and seeing an alien staring back at you in a way that you'd feel like dying of total shock. The commotion of the birthday children also adds to the disturbing effect of the scene. The final half hour of the film is brilliant too. The family decide to stay in their house and board up all the windows and doors instead of leaving for good. There are many superb moments towards the end, and the highly dramatic musical score adds to this immensely. There are many symbolic meanings in Signs that make it all the more enjoyable. Bo's obsession with clean water leads to the source that rids the aliens from the earth and Morgan's asthma problem is perfectly handled, especially towards the end of the film. His asthma problem leads to Graham putting his faith back into the church and resuming his job as a vicar. The film has many emotional ties; while the rest of world is no doubt going crazy with horror, the film manages to keep most of the screen time on the family, and how they deal with such a situation.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

Director M. Night Shyamalan is definitely one of the best directors in today's world of film. The man is a truly unique writer/director who already has a trademark ability to hold the audience in suspense through twists and clever filming. He is fast becoming the new king of horror/suspense films much like Hitchcock, but with his own trademark signature. Signs rounds off a brilliant trilogy of hugely successful films from Shyamalan, and I'm sure there will be more to come from him in the future.",1048636800,,5524,4.66735112936345

In both movies, Mel Gibson was a single father confronted on his own property with an invasion by a greater force.
In The Patriot, Mel Gibson and his children boldly fought the invaders. They not only defended themselves, they took the offensive whenever they could. Even his children were frequently portrayed using guns.
Let's just say that their strategy in Signs was about as different as possible. (There were no guns in Signs.)
When Mel Gibson discovered valuable information about the aliens, he didn't even tell anyone. Nevertheless, we are supposed to accept that his only moral shortcoming was not having faith that someone or something would save them.
Signs is scary, but it is intended for the whole family because there is almost no blood or violence. However ...
The moral lessons of Signs are that each of us is helpless and worthless apart from how much some higher power might value us. Therefore, we should never act with aggression or initiative until we receive a definite ""sign"" (hence the title) from this higher power telling us what to do. Regardless of whether this higher power is supposed to be a god or a government, that is probably not a lesson you want your kids to learn.",1048377600,3,1444,4.826612903225806

To sum it up, it's the biggest disappointment of the year. The performances in ""Signs"" are incredible. Mel Gibson is excellent as the priest Graham. Most of the scares work, but the subplots get in the way of what the movie's main conflict is, which is alien invasion. Instead, the film wants to preach to us about hope and faith while at the same time scaring our pants off with creepy clicking aliens. Which brings me to the end, a solution so contrived and dumb that it boggles me that so many people were willing to believe it. If you saw the movie, as yourself this: during the world-wide invasion, wasn't it raining somewhere?

1475733,4,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan is messing with people in good and bad ways.  In one way he's making people take their time and wait for the payoff from a movie. Most people are literally programmed for a film to last 90 minutes for everything to be explained up front for it to neatly wrap itself up and for all to be well at the end.  Unfortunately really good films are not simple, like the audience for bad films.  I really liked this movie not because of the building tension but because you weren't quite sure WHAT was going on.  I didn't walk into the movie knowing if anyone would live or die or if their were kids playing on the roof, spirits come back from the dead or aliens dropping from outer space.  The art to anything dramatic is the suspension of disbelief, of not knowing what's going to happen.  That doesn't mean that the pay off will be enormous, simply unexpected.
There is a concept of synchronicity in the world, the concept that what you know is known and reverberates through the universe around you.  That what makes no sense today, glasses and glasses of water everywhere, may be your salvation tomorrow.  This film and M. Night Shyamalan take advantage of that and use it to stupendous results.  He's a great writer and filmmaker and even her a surprisingly good filmmaker and I look forward to his work in the future to see if he's mastered this trick and has others up his sleeve as well.",1047600000,,1406,4.4609375

It is refreshing to see a lack of gore and violence. It is good to see implied threat rather than being bashed over the head with direct images. Not everything needs to be literal. While watching Signs I completely forgot about time. It is a simple film that contrasts the metaphor of signs within the context of the story line and theme of faith.
The look of the film, the inherent beauty of the scenes and sets made for excellent atmosphere.
Signs did well in the theaters and stayed popular for a substantial time. It seems large audiences want to see films in this nature, and this comes from a person that usually prefers so-called 'art' films.
Based on some of the scathing comments I would not have bothered to view Signs. It was much better than anticipated.

1475835,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan is known for his twist endings, so a lot of people expected ""Signs"" to have a twist ending of its own.
Unfortunately, this movie is not as satisfying as Mr. Shyamalan's previous efforts.
The plot is structured around an alien invasion, but you hardly ever see the aliens. This made me feel like the director knew his Creature FX weren't going to be good, so he invented ways to get around showing them. What's scarier than not showing anything? Showing SOMEthing! The one cool alien scene is the ""birthday video."" It's bone-chilling, because we get to see the alien, even if only for a moment.
The most enraging part of ""Signs"" was the thinly woven coincidences that you're expected to believe. It felt like M. Night Shyamalan just wrote a bunch of scenes, and came up with a way to slap 'em all together at the end. What a gyp!
He also ""fixed"" plot holes by addressing them in the movie! For example, Rory Culkin finds a used book about aliens, and most of the theories in the book just happen to pertain to the aliens that are in the process of invading. M. Night Shyamalan knew the audience would be asking ""how would the author of the book know that?"" so he has Mel Gibson ask that very question! I guess we're all supposed to be grateful that the script identifies its own flaws for us.
As an alien-invasion movie goes, this film is sub-par, especially in regards to the obligatory alien weakness. Look to a superior film like ""the Arrival"" (starring Charlie Sheen) to get a sense of how to really freak people out with aliens.
Here's my twist ending for you: this whole review is false. I actually loved every part of ""Signs!"" It's my favorite movie from a very talented director.",1047254400,,1705,4.538961038961039

Other than that I have no arguements or complaints about the movie. I really like how Night makes the actors in his movies so emotionless, yet so you can still realize the actor's talent in the movie. Sixth Sense and Unbreakable are probably two of my favorite movies in suspense. Yet I really think Night should've let someone else write the script for this one.",1046822400,3,519,4.416666666666667

The movie is slow, unconnected, too obvious and poorly written. M. Night Shyamalan assumes we're too dumb to catch subtle hints so he over exaggerates them to make sure we don't miss his point. The over-pronounced outline of the crucifix on the wall, the excessive placement of glasses of water around the house - you know they'll all come into play at the end of the movie. The camera sits idle for meticulously long periods of time and doesn't add any drama or suspense to the story line. Shyamalan follows his Unbreakable style of movie making by spending more time framing a shot rather than framing the entire film to flow smoothly. I wasn't expecting a lot from the film and that's what I got. I think it's still worth seeing but probably not a good thing for Amazon.com when I recommend that you rent this one instead of adding it to your DVD library. I'm sure this will be one of the bargain movies for under [money] in a couple of years. It could have been worst... (...). By the way...one of the DVD extras is a short documentary about the location scouts finding 40 acres of land so they could plow, plant corn and built a farm house for the movie. WOW!

Mel Gibsons role is very important. He is the main character.  His attiude and expressions fit his part very well.  He was a good choice for the main role.  The closeness of the family shows that they care for one another.  The unity as a family really brings the story together.  It is interesting how the movie is filmed through the life of the family and not the town.
The movie was really good.  The farm atmosphere helped create the eerieness of the situation.  At times the storyline went a little to in depth with details but over all did a good just laying out details and hints.  The directors pick of actors was close to perfect.

Well the thing that I would change in the movie is how it begins. You kind of get loss if you did not know what you were watching. Another thing I did like how they set up the scene where he is remembering his wife and how she died I really didn't understand that quiet well. I could see if the alien had posing her then I see putting in that scene. I really didn't see the meaning of all that. The also good parts as well how Mel Gibson help his son breath with him and how he ask good not to take his son away like he took his wife from him. Also like the girl and the boy because I thought they played a good role in the movie. I thought they played that part with mel Gibson. That how I feel about the movie signs.

If you like a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat you should see this one.  Throughout the length of the movie the you will definately experience lots of things that will keep you glued.
One of my favorite parts is when Graham and Merril chase what they think are the Pritcherd brothers around the house. But then they couldn't find anyone. Also I believe the characters were cast well. I think Mel Gibson playing the part of a preacher did an exelent job. It made this scene work because you don't usually see a preacher cuss. It was a comical scene.
Another favorite part is when the little girl comes into her dads bedroom and asks for  a glass of water. Watch this scene very carefully so you don't miss any details.

1475923,3,B00005JL3T,"Signs is another science fiction movie about aliens coming to our planet.  The movie was well directed and took place in the wide-open farmlands of Pennsylvania, which made the story more believable.
Other then the children being completely boring and a little too smart for their own age, they were good actors.  The actor who portrayed Merrill, Mel Gibson's brother, did a mediocre job.  Mel Gibson had to carry him throughout the entire film.  Mel Gibson added some humor at some points which were pretty funny.
The storyline was not bad and kept the viewer guessing to what was going on until the very end.  You never knew who certain people where and what they meant to the story when you first saw them.
I would recommend this movie for people to see, not as a scary movie though. The movie is more drama, and about a man and his faith in God.  If it wasn't for the jumpy scenes, which were great, in this movie, it would just be catogorized as another sci-fi movie about aliens coming to earth.

Everyone, especially the children, played their characters perfectly.  The setting was especially creepy.  The idea of having it take place on a farm, with no one around for miles, just corn fields, was great.  Horror films that take place in the countryside rather then the city, have more of an effect on your mind.
  The whole plot of the story builds up slowly, but the entire time, I guarantee you'll have Goosebumps waiting for something to happen or pop out at you.  It makes you think.  When I watched this movie, the wheels in my head started to turn and I asked myself plenty of questions that would normally seem outlandish.  ""Are we really alone?"" And ""Could this ever really happen?""  In my opinion, no we are not alone, and M. Night points out perfectly that this could someday happen.

The characors in the story overall i found very very well portrayed. The main children seemed a bit overly smart, but definatly not to the point this it was unbelievable. They helped move the story along very well and added a great persoal touch.
Small town, corn fields, and the house the family lived in i believe were all teh perfect setting for such an earie story. These places give it a great mysterious feeling and fit in perfectly. If anything were to be added to the story i would have choosen some of the extra clips or outtakes.

I did, however, enjoy the fact that the director put all of these events through the eyes of one family and one family alone, unlike most alien movies that show the entire world or government facilities.  These were your regular, everyday, small town people, over coming unproportional odds, but against aliens?
While I'm on the subject of the aliens, don't you think that if these aliens were alergic to water, they either 1.  would not harvest a planet whose most abundunt recourse is water, and where virtually everything, including humans, have water in them or 2.  would wear environmental suits, protecting them from the atmosphere and supersoakers, that is, if they are so smart (these aliens built cloaking devices for their space shuttles, as well as  the ships themselves, also they sent scanners out to ""check out"" the area to see if anything harmful is around, including vapor and water baloons).  Also, if these aliens have the leg strength to jump on top of a 10 foot barn, you'd think that they could kick down a pantery door.  Quite proposterous!
All in all, this movie had a clear and good moral, but eh way the writers got around to it was completely unbelievable and unorigional

It you watch movies of the symbolism this in a great one to watch. It is chak full of it. Mel Gibson is amazing. I really recomend this.
This is a story about one mans faith struggle, and how he comes to gripes with the loss of his wife. Its a story of how he relizes that God can overcome everything in life, even the greatest of evils (ex: the aliens).
Symbolism to look out for:
The water (it ties the whole movie together)
Bo's dreams
The book that his son buys at the store.
The family dinner where they eat anything they want.
and much more...
These all tie toghther with religious ideas, you have to look very closely and pay attention. Its a fantastic film, and one of my personal favorits.

""K-PAX"".

1476010,1,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is a film that labors to show that it's far better than what it really is, but it ends up being silly, derivative, and formulaic.  M. Night Shyamalan's new movie is even worse than the anticlimatic ""Unbreakable"" (2000), which was the followup to his smash hit ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999).  Mel Gibson plays an ex-minister who gave up on his faith when his wife was tragically killed in a car accident.  When aliens crash land his home, not only must he act to protect his family, but he's also confronted by some personal inner demons.  The setup is promising, but the execution allows the movie to collapse under its own weight.  The dialogue (particularly among the kids) is cheesy, the film drags at an incredibly slow pace, and the viewer is distracted by M. Night's annoying cameo appearances.  But the biggest kick is when the family, having already been invaded by aliens, take a ""vote"" to decide whether they should vacate their home.  Vote???  To recycle an old joke, if Black people lived in that house, they would have left town--and fast--at the first sight of an alien.  To be fair, a few creepy moments do pop up, but by then we've already looked at our watches a half-dozen times.  For a decent alien film, you're better off revisiting ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) or, even better, ""Alien"" (1979) and ignore these ""signs.""",1046563200,16,1357,4.711864406779661

1476012,2,B00005JL3T,"I had high hopes for this movie. I was really hoping M. Night Shyamalan would do something new and interesting with the genre but really it irked me on a number of levels.  Hopefully I won't give away any spoilers here but apologies in advance if I do.
1. The premise, why would super advanced alien beings capable of interstellar travel invade a planet where the substance that they are extremely vulnerable to covers 70% of that planet's surface?  Not that smart for such an advanced race of beings.
2. Why should a young kid conveniently know everything there is to know about a race of super advanced star-people?  I understand the whole ""creepy kid"" thing is a bit of a tradition in the suspense movie genre but I wasn't really sold in this case.
3. Why did the director chose to cast himself in such a prominent role? For those who didn't spot him, M. Night Shyamalan plays the part of Ray Reedy the vet / doctor who is responsible for the car accident which claimed the life of the wife of Mel Gibson's character.  Not that he did a bad job, but it did seem a little self-indulgent.
4. If your home was being invaded by anyone, especially Little Green Men, why would you proceed to beat one of them up, lock it in your kitchen pantry and then blag to your curious neighbour about it?
5. M. Night Shyamalan did such a good job of building up tension by keeping the creatures lurking in the shadows and only showing them in silhouette.  Why would you shatter all that suspense and tension but then showing your bad guys walking around in broad daylight?  This in particular really ruined the movie for me.  I am a firm believer that less is more when it comes to this kind of movie. Let the audience's imagination run wild trying to guess what you mystery baddy is rather than exposing it to the world and losing all the shock value.  Compare for example the effectiveness and impact of the scene in the coal cellar when compared to the rather cheap shock of the movies final confrontation.
This is not to say that I thought this movie was all bad.  The acting was at least of reasonable standard, with the two child actor standing out and Mr Phoenix being his reliable self.  And the direction was OK, most of gripes are with the story itself.

1476017,2,B00005JL3T,"I'm not averse to directors' taking film genres that we are all familiar with and doing new things with them. That is what M. Night Shyamalan is apparently trying to do in Signs, taking the classical alien invasion film and focussing on how one particular family copes with everybody's worst nightmare. It's an interesting idea, and it worked really well for about the first half of the film. Up until that point, we still do not know what or who is leaving those mysterious crop circles. This creates an almost unbearable atmosphere of suspense, which is heightened by Shyamalan's technical skills as a filmmaker. I nearly jumped out of my seat a few times in the scenes in which Mel Gibson's character is walking through his cornfield at night, including one scene in which he catches a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye. This is the kind of stuff that I was expecting when I paid for my ticket. But then the film gets all messy. First we have an appearance by Shyamalan himself that is absolutely mystifying and seemingly unrelated to the whole plot. In another scene, Gibson's family watches recorded footage on television of an alien walking past terrified schoolchildren in Brazil. The scene is admittedly creepy to say the least, but it has the unsavory consequence of removing most of the suspense from the film. Now we know exactly who is leaving the crop circles; it doesn't really help that Shyamalan's aliens are incredibly unoriginal, indeed like something out of the original Star Trek series. After that, things kind of fall apart. This becomes especially acute when Shyamalan injects his typical spiritual conundrum into the plot, as we learn that Mel Gibson's character is a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a traffic accident. And unsurprisingly, after we learn this, much of the rest of the film revolves around Gibson regaining his faith in time to save his family. Just exactly what the connection is between Gibson's born again status and his family's survival is uncertain in the film, but the implication is that the former led to the latter. But ignoring the unsuitability of adding this dimension to the plot, the whole logic of Gibson's transformation is even stranger. Remember, his wife's death made him lose his faith; this is obviously a horrible tragedy for anyone to deal with, maybe the worst, but as a Christian Gibson's character would logically be consoled with the knowledge that his wife is in a better place and that he will see her again someday. Now, an alien invasion occurs. Rather than intensifying Gibson's disbelief, as his wife's death did, this unimaginable occurrence causes him to regain his faith. Wow! Maybe I'm being too picky, though. More unforgiveable is Shyamalan's attitude toward the whole plot. He seems to presume that his deep spirituality absolves him from having to come up with an interesting plot resolution. That is the only explanation that I can think of for the ending. It is simply too unconvincing and indeed absurd to be taken seriously. I won't say anymore on that. For me, the half-dozen or so terrifying scenes in the first half of the movie did not make up for the disappointing finale. I was not frightened once in the last hour, only irritated.

Camera-work, generating atmosphere, lighting, set design, he's outstanding with; maybe the best since Hitchcock (as some people have implied). Unfortunately for 'Signs', concise story-telling dosen't seem to be one of them.
There are a couple of real issues with the plot of this movie that needed to be addressed before this movie was released. For example, the ending was similar to 'War of the Worlds', but the hook dosen't make any sense. Why would aliens with a certain weakness want to invade a planet covered by so much of it?
At one point a stat is given about Joaquin Phoenix's home run record. Does anybody appreciate how far that home run would be? It would be the longest in history.

Now, now, the aliens COULD invade, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying who in their right minds would decide to stay in an isolated home, miles from anywhere, and ""wait"" for the invasion to happen? Who? I would go for the safety in numbers theory if I were in their shoes.  Also, there really is a slight build-up, but the climax is anti-climatic.

1476167,3,B00005JL3T,"This is not a particularly good movie, but as is the case with so many movies, that shouldn't necessarily stop you from watching it. It's light, predictable fare, with a ""deep"" message about faith and belief thrown in just to round things out. It has some laughs, it has a little drama, it has a really cute little girl. Basically, it's fine for blowing a couple hours.
If your expectations are higher than that, though, you're out of luck. Most of the plot points were heavily telegraphed: part of the fun turned out to be repeatedly saying to each other, ""Gee, I wonder if THAT'S going to prove important later on?"" As far as the frame for the whole story, the bit with the aliens... well, that was pretty much just there to have an excuse to do the rest of the movie. They apparently didn't think it was necessary for any of that to make sense, or to, well, to actually *write* anything for that storyline.
What they did have was quite a bit of just plain bad acting, with the scene in the recruiting office standing out as particularly unwatchable.
On a personal note, I can't help but wonder why they bothered specifically setting the movie in Bucks County, PA, then went out of their way to make it seem as unlike Bucks County as possible. Apparently they did film there, but it looks more like the leftover ""Field of Dreams"" set than the largely suburban area just outside Philadelphia that it is. And what exactly did the locals do to make them so mad? Because WOW what an insulting portrayal! ""Oh, we got that book in by mistake, but we decided to keep it for the city folk."" Right after we married our first cousins and got the still set up out back, hyuck hyuck...
Like I said, it's not a great movie. As far as your major motion pictures go, though, it's fair to call it a solid average 3. If someone else is buying, it's an OK rental.",1045872000,3,1847,4.387755102040816
1476168,2,B00005JL3T,"One thing I do have to give M. Night Shyamalan credit for--he's an excellent director.  Now, if he could just hire someone to actually write a decent script, he could turn out some good movies.  Unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen.
The point of this movie (as I see it) is one man's journey to regain his lost faith.  Mel Gibson does a great job as ex-Father Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix is great as Graham's brother.  The plot of the movie, however, is senseless and devoid of anything interesting.
The story revolves around a supposed alien invasion.  Most of the film is an utterly uninteresting buildup to this point.  The plot is full of holes, and (as is typical of Night's films) you are often left scratching your head and wondering why nothing seems to fit together.
Most of the suspense (for which this movie was acclaimed) consists of the characters going somewhere without the means to protect themselves.  The Hess brothers repeatedly enter a corn field (which they suspect contains hostile aliens) with nothing more than a flashlight, and, at the end of the film, actually set down a pickaxe before going to 'check things out' and see if they're in physical danger.  Brilliant.  Flashlight dropping is a good trick too, one that is used repeatedly.  It seems that, whenever Night wants us to build suspense, someone drops a flashlight.  Cute.
People who enjoy a movie where suspense means wierd camera angles and stuff jumping out of nowhere will be entertained--most everyone else will be bored stiff.  Take my advice and skip this one--you may see crop circles on the cover, but that doesn't mean the circles play any real role in the film.",1045785600,5,1675,4.7979094076655056

1476271,3,B00005JL3T,"This is the third of M. Night Shyamalan's suspense films and unfortunately shows a continued erosion in quality from the films that preceded it.  The Sixth Sense was Shyamalan's breakout movie and for good reason.  It was suspenseful and engaging with a twist at the end that no one saw coming and that made the viewer realize they were watching a very different film than they first thought.  Unbreakable was also an excellent movie, but the twist at the end proved more of a disappointment than a revelation.
Signs again proves that Shyamalan is a master at setting up a suspenseful situation and engaging the audience in the story.  However, in this movie, he builds up to a climax that never comes.  First, multiple crop circles begin to appear throughout the world.  Then alien ships begin to appear over several major cities, and very quickly it becomes apparent that their intentions are sinister.  However, this is not a movie about alien invasions.  It focuses on farmer (and former minister) Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and how he and his family deal with the alien arrival.  There is a twist of sorts at the end, but not like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.  Perhaps Shyamalan realized that he could not rely on this gimmick indefinitely and decided to try something new.  But the build up of suspense that he so carefully crafts through the movie ends with a whimper.  Ultimately, it is more a movie about Graham's struggles with his own faith than alien invaders.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the movie does cop out on resolving the alien conflict.
It does not help that Mel Gibson acts like he is in a fog for the first two thirds of the movie, either.  Shyamalan employed a similar technique with Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable but was more successful with it in those movies.  And it made more sense in the context of those films.  Gibson just seems like a robot reading lines at times and only really becomes engaged toward the end of the movie.
Signs is not a bad film, it is just somewhat disappointing.  It seems that Shyamalan is feeling so much pressure to outdo his previous movies that he is stumbling on his own good intentions.  He certainly has a talent at building suspense, he just seems to be running short on ideas to resolve his stories.",1045612800,4,2296,4.641089108910891

This film continues in the vein of M. Night's suspenseful storytelling style.  However, it has a lot more humor in it than the previous films (this becomes more apparent once you've watched it more than once).  All of the actors give great performances, which is necessary since the story is primarily a psychological thriller.
For all of those who didn't like this movie, I can understand, although I disagree wholeheartedly.  It is a movie, not a film,and the whole point is to be entertained--which is what M. Night has done here.  So pop some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy.",1045612800,2,839,4.641891891891892

Signs was, to me, slow, boring, and too far fetched.  The humor was not funny and the acting was not all that good. The female cop should go back to high school plays and leave the profession to the professionals.  But, then again, there was nothing professional about this movie.  Sorry Mel, I still love you anyway. Sudami",1045612800,2,496,4.406593406593407
1476274,4,B00005JL3T,"M.Night Shyamalan is a director with great style. His visions are unique. His focus is always fresh, and clear. Like Spielberg, he tackles various genre, and he is able to wring out new perspective; and he uses children as a primary vehicle to inhabit the world both with a sense of wonder and fear. Much has been written about the lapses of logic in this film, yet I find its stylistic flair masks its imperfections perfectly.
Shyamalan has woven a nightmare for us, pregnant with primal fears and suspensful moments; and like any other bad dream, certain things are out of balance. We, as the viewers don't realize the director's intent and perspective. We respond literally, and certain questions nag us.... why don't the Hess boys own a gun ? Why don't the aliens know more about the dangers of earth's environment ? Haven't the armies of the earth mobilized to fight them, and if so, what are the results ? Why don't the aliens use more technology to attack us ? And we wonder is this an actual weakness in the writing, or do we expect too much, have seen too much F/X laden Sci-Fi, loaded with pyrotechnics ? Reviewers seem conficted on these points. I tended to enjoy the film, praising the performances, and was propelled along on the crest of emotion as this family faced its peril.
Mel Gibson, as lapsed minister Graham Hess, gives a heartfelt performance that reminds us what a fine actor he really is. His humanity, his doubts and fears, just leap off the screen. When he converses with his wife, as she is dying, love is wrenched from his grasp, torn from his chest. He is left with an inability to continue to believe in God, and a deep despair that grips him like a choke collar. Later, when he is holding his son in the basement, while the boy is having an asthma attack, one can see clearly that Mel, as an actual parent, intensily loves his own children.
Joaquin Phoenix was very effective as the brother Merrill. He filled in the strength that Mel needed, to continue on the farm, to raise his children, and to fight against the alien menance that threatened to destroy them. Rory Culkin as Morgan, the son, was likewise quite good. His intellect and bravery, gave us a tiny hero to cheer for, and to pray for. Abigail Breslin, as Bo the daughter, was wonderful. She is a beautiful child, secure in her naturalness, and strangely calm as the hectic drama swirled about her. Cherry Jones, as officer Paski, brought dignity and warmth to the role of the local constabulary. It was refreshing to see a woman in this role.
Principally, this is a 1950's invasion film, just cloaked in a modern perspective. There is no Spielberg sweetness and benevolence dropping on us from the night sky; rather these aliens are the stuff of 1930's pulp fiction and B movies. The aliens are out to conquer and harm. They are the bogeymen, and the things that howl and go bump in the night, staring through our windows, and running across our rooves. And they are the stuff of allegory and prophecy and symbolism. There are myriads of layers within this black dream. Enjoy them.",1045526400,2,3076,4.604735883424408
1476275,5,B00005JL3T,"read several of the other reviews, and decided that a new perspective was needed.  IMHO, this movie is more of a parable than a entertainment vehicle.  The plot is secondary to the issues that are explored - not the least of which is whether there is a god...  and the great part is that they are just explored, not solved for you.  For instance, Mel Gibson delivers one of the best arguments against there being a god that I have heard, but also reconsiders at the end.
That being said, it is also a damn fine entertaining movie.  The alien attack thing is totally ridiculous, but that's almost the point.  You must suspend your disbelief and ""get into it"" to enjoy it, and if you do, it will scare the hell out of you.  It's as if M.N.S. has channelled the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock!  He understands that the scariest thing he can possibly show is nothing at all - your imagination will supply the perfect scary image if the stage has been set properly.
So this movie is one of those very rare works of art that is both aesthetically pleasing and deeply meaningful.",1045440000,,1068,4.441025641025641

This movie was absolutely horrible.  It was not scary or thrilling.  Signs was extremely over hyped and over rated.  I can not believe that Mel Gibson would want to be a part of this horrible movie.  The scariest part of the movie was when the dog barked unexpectedly.  From the clich use of crop circles to the lame attack of aliens, this movie was worthless.  I would rather spend my money on a chick flick than this movie.  At least a chick flick has some sort of comic relief.  I would recommend any movie over this one.

Call it a sci-fi thriller rather than horror film, *Signs* is about how an unknown mysterious set of crop circles elaborate overnight in a field owned by Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson). Graham is a minister who has lost his faith after his wife is killed. Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother Merrill who has just moved in to take care of Graham's two children. After sighting the crop circles in his cornfield, Graham quickly dismisses any potential threat and concludes it as a hoax, hoping to appease his disturbed children. A series of strange events including the reported sightings of UFOs on TV escalate Graham's alert about these mysterious crop circles. Rumor has it that it could be a new round of alien invasion. The movie has a slow start but quickly builds up the suspense. For a long time the suspense really has it on the audience that something horrible might creep up around the Graham's house. The scene in which Gibson and Phoenix roam about into the cornfield at night is creepy. Otherwise it's more like a sci fi thriller.

The strong direction brings out compelling characters, as expressed by a superior cast.  Cherry Jones is fantastic.  For that matter, so are Gibson, Phoenix and the rest.
Signs is NOT a B-movie, and it is NOT an action movie.  It is NOT even a sci-fi movie per se.  Rather, it presents a grieving family in the face of an existential crisis (or two, actually).  This movie speaks to life's most basic questions with emotion and clarity.

Night Shymalan fails to measure up with his past spine-tinglers The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable whereby the plot is more charlatan than substance. This is tangible as our X-philic minds run wilder than the plot of invasions by ailens and navigational signs left by them on the cropfield. We are struggling for a logical reason as to why the water is polluted and why is there the reception of weird frequency. We were expecting more of a hoax when it well, reveals to be a D-day stormed by UFOs. Signs lacks the stunning epilogues that Shymalan's works are always capable of producing as well as the subtle sense of mystery. It is in this case overblown and ridiculous. Shymalan tries to convey a simple paean of loss souls recovering faith and belief but ends up empty and pretentious.

For example, I haven't seen a movie use camera angles as effectively as this one since I studied ""Citizen Kane"" in a Film As Art class in college.  The feeling of aloneness and desperation is at a fever pitch and has you aching in your heart at times.  Then there are the lighter, more humorous moments interjected throughout the movie that only make you more susceptible to the tension and suspense of the darker, more malevolent ones.

In my opinion this is his not his best work, but far and away better than most of the hollywood garbage out there.  The common theme in Night's movies has been the suprise or plot twisting ending and this one is no different.  The ending is not as shocking or high profile as in his previous 2 movies, but that doesn't take away from it's effect.
The movie is about a rural family in the middle of an invasion by aliens.  This is not a monster or alien movie as you only get to see them twice in the whole movie.  It is more about the things we take for granted and the things we see as flaws.  As the title implies, it's about signs.

Everyone who has been forced to watch this movie got it. The message is every bit as dull and predictable as the movie itself.
Every time the story even starts to get going, something so freaking stupid it makes my very brain ache happens. Have a touching moment about God vs Chance... follow it up with a story about a girl puking on herself. Yep, that's good cinema.
We have a family who are so dumb it's sad. No TV, it's evil. Don't ever talk to the girl who swears again, she's evil. Don't ever talk to any people from out of town, they're evil. Don't ever call anyone by anything but their full name, it's evil. Don't prey, it's evil... or something, he doesn't know. Got it? No?

1476501,4,B00005JL3T,"I'd give the movie itself 4.5 stars, but the DVD gets only 4 because I'd like a director's commentary.  M. Night does provide some insightful extras, but these are not adequate, in my opinion.
Night's last 2 films suit my tastes.  I know not everybody is going to love his films because they are slow, sparse, deliberate, and character-driven.  Many people will be bored senseless by the goings-on of one family on a farm waiting out an alien invasion.
I personally love Night's revelatory style, and I love how he involves the audience by allowing them clues as to what direction the movie will take, if only the audience will play along with him.  I love his ability to inject reality into his films that make them so resonant.
-""I can't hear my children.""--Graham
-""Don't ever say anything like that again.""--Merrill, scolding his nephew
-Graham startling awake as his daughter stares down at him in bed.
-Merrill falling out of bed when he hears his niece screaming outside.
I could personally relate to every one of these instances, and they showed that Shyamalan knows what it means to be part of a family.  Night's attention to detail is evident through Mel's restraint when he deals with his athsmatic son.  His son is involved in a few situations that would send most kids into crying fits and most parents into fits of worry.  However, Graham and his child have developed a resolute calmness because overexertion could trigger a tortuous attack of asthma in the young boy.
I don't think the movie was full of holes.  If you listen to every line and really understand the charcters, it makes sense.  If you just casually observe EVENTS and the most obvious details, the finer points, of course, will be lost.  Nobody seems to be allowing for the possibility that not only were the aliens hostile, but they were also arrogant.
I was literally squirming in my seat by the end of this movie, and it was so compelling that even my 5 year-old daughter was riveted to the TV screen.
Signs in a few words is:
Compelling.  Intimate.  Revelatory.  Coherent.  Intense.  Delicate.  Deliberate.  Playful.  Personal.  Tightly woven.
This review was longer than I intended, and will probably only be read by 2 or fewer people, ever, but oh well.  I wanted to voice my admiration for Shyamalan and the great potential he has shown, and I hope his list of admirers grows.",1044835200,4,2364,4.733496332518337
1476502,4,B00005JL3T,"I have to say that I sometimes wonder if I'm some how intellectually inferior to these ""so called"" film critics. Or, maybe my pallet is used to bologna and theirs to caviar. Maybe they are just so desensitized these days that, short of a cinematic masterpiece that's also up for a Pulitzer prize, nothing phases them anymore.... They're almost numb. I thought this movie is an ""A"" movie not a sensational ""B"" movie as its being touted by these critics (I do give it 4 stars though). M. Night Shyamalans' 3rd movie is one that takes us back to the older movies that rely on scaring you with the unknown; the door that ""creeks"" as it's being opened and the dark rooms that scared us so much as children. Not exploding heads or someone being shot up to a million pieces right before our eyes. He also does a nice job of injecting that ""nervous humor"" from the adults and innocent humor from the children.
This is about the challenges of faith and the strength of a parents love disguised as an alien invasion movie. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a farmer and former minister, that lives in rural Pennsylvania with his two young children, Morgan (Rory Culkin, Macaulay's brother), who has Asthma, and Bo (Abigail Breslin) who is absolutely adorable and, in my opinion, the next great child actor. Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), who's Graham's brother and one time minor league baseball player, has moved in after the death of Graham's wife six months prior when she was hit by a car. This incident has caused Graham to loose his faith and quit his congregation. Then, sudden appearances of crop circles in his cornfield, which at first is shrugged off as local pranksters, but the over night sightings all over the world challenges Graham and the rest of the world to re-evaluate our belief system. The chemistry between Gibson and Phoenix is very natural and convincing. In fact, this movie was cast extremely well! The movie, at times, can get a little heavy handed with the Fatherly love message but it doesn't ""muck up"" the movie to the point where you loose interest in the story. Shyamalan gives this movie the same feel that the old Twilight Zone episodes used to have, where you are left with anticipation and your imagination. The 4 stars instead of 5 stems from the fact that he could have punctuated 1 or 2 of the scenes a little with some visuals, instead of lying back like he did. That being said, this is the newest movie to enter my top 10 list of favorites. I can live with the few scenes that were too ""light""! As for the Home Theater experience, since the movie is more suspense than action/horror, there isn't much going on that will use the sub(s) or work the surrounds too much. But, when it does use the surrounds, like the scene when the alien is on the roof of the house, the THX certified disc enhances the scene and really makes you anxious! The scenes in the cornfield when the wind is blowing are very convincing! There is a second disc with hours (and I mean hours) of extras!! I'm not an extras guy, strictly meat and potatoes for me!! This is a movie to buy, not rent!!",1044835200,2,3091,4.541218637992832
1476503,3,B00005JL3T,"It's becoming a staple of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan to explore paranormal phenomenons with his films.  ""The Sixth Sense"" encapsulated the world's deeply rooted belief in the afterlife and the existence of restless spirits (ghosts); ""Unbreakable"" explored the inexplicable chance of surviving horrific catastrophes with either minor or no injuries sustained (the unexplained/miracles).  Now with his latest project, Shyamalan explores the phenomenon of crop circles and the possibility of life on other planets.  In short, aliens.
Like his previous work, ""Signs"" is a deliberately paced film, slowly building the suspense as a no-name place like Bucks County, PE becomes the center of extraterrestrial activity.  The movie begins with widowed and retired reverend Graham Hesse (Gibson) waking from a restless sleep to the sound of Bo (Breslin) and Morgan (Culkin), his two young children, screaming from the cornfields.  He rushes out in a panic to find the both of them staring raptly at a circular patch of flattened stalks, one of many shapes that form an intricate pattern on nearly half his field.  Before long, crop circles start appearing en masse and soon there is a national uproar with news stations all over the world airing frightening footage 24 hours a day.  The obsession of Graham's children and his brother Merrill (Phoenix) grows when Morgan purchases an obscure reference on aliens from a local bookstore, sharing his wealth of information with his highly skeptical father.  Graham is soon wrapped up into it all as everything that Morgan reads and tells him becomes a reality, the group relying on their child messiah to guide them through the distinct possibility of a hostile invasion.
Shyamalan gives us another small cast of characters, creating the illusion of total isolation with the stillness of the Hesse family's sprawling acres.  Gibson is the stand-out as the tortured Graham, struggling to raise his children while grieving their deceased mother.  Rory Culkin and Abigail Bentley are Morgan and Bo, Graham's precocious children; there seems to be a wealth of Culkin boys and it looks like Rory's the last in a long line, not to mention the best of them all so far.  People will find it hard not to crack a smile when Breslin's immense, puppy-dog eyes are consuming the screen and her tiny voice is asking Gibson for a glass of water (Bo has a fear of contamination).  Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones and Shyamalan make up the supporting cast.  Phoenix, having played many a queer and tortured soul (Gladiator, To Die For) in films past gets to show off comedic abilities no one knew he had.  Shyamalan is a fair actor but he's better off behind the camera.  Although he does an adequate job as an anguished neighbor named Ray (he has cameos in both of his previous films), his character serves no other purpose than to conspicuously drop an integral clue for the film's climactic ending.
Although ""Signs"" is for the most part moody and suspenseful, it's also speckled with humor, particularly the farce involving long-documented folklore about aliens.  Shymalan goofs his own subject matter and gets genuine laughs, the many diverse superstitions of his audience (skeptics and believers alike) meshed into a universal humor.  Overall, the film will entertain most audiences but it only packs half the frightening punch of the ""The Sixth Sense"".  Those looking to get the creeps will feel a little disappointed but nonetheless satiated.
Rent ""Signs"" if you crave a good-old fashioned thriller with light scares and a director who will never tire of exploring the strange and unusual.",1044748800,,3621,5.129251700680272

It was dark, dreary, and the acting...wow was it bad!  Everyone acted as if they were zombies staring mindlessly in space or at their televisions and talking to themselves. Then the real message came out. Mel Gibson's character is an ex-father and has lost his faith in God and is looking for a sign to re-new his faith. If I knew this movie was simply geared toward clinging to a religion instead of learning to be strong enough to stand on our own 2 feet, I never would have bothered with it. But then again, to mix religion with aliens and science is a different approach, one which I applaud, for if you believe your God created everything, then he created the aliens as well.  Still this doesn't make up for this movie being really boring. I am sure the director had good intentions but it is a very slow paced B-movie.",1044662400,2,974,4.528409090909091

1476604,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" definitely ranks near the top of my favorite movies list. When I first walked into the theater to see this movie, I wasn't expecting anything more than a cheesy B movie. It more than exceeded my expectations. Mel Gibson plays his role to perfection, playing a former clergyman who abandoned his faith when his wife was killed by a drunk driver because he doubted God's purpose for pain in a person's life. Then hostile aliens invade Earth, and Gibson's character, Gordon Hess and his family are caught up in a struggle to survive the alien invasion, and Hess returns to his former way of thinking, and believes in God again, having learned a valuable lesson in faith during the course of his struggle to survive the alien invasion. He realizes that it was miraculous that his family lived through the attack, and realizes further that God helped them through it.
The best aspect of this film is the character development. The characters are so well developed and convincing and the cast is perfect in portraying the lives of the individuals. Another excellent aspect of this film is that it is very thought-provoking. I especially enjoyed the flashback that occurs at the end of the movie of Gordon Hess questioning his close friend about where his faith lies.

1476605,5,B00005JL3T,"I really think that a lot of people have missed the subtle point of this movie........it is NOT about aliens.  If you are expecting a hollywood blockbuster about alien invasion,  and the allies saving the day, then rent Independence Day.  This movie is about faith, family and hope, and what happens when these things are taken (or threaten to be taken) away from us.  That nothing in the world, good or bad, is a matter of chance it was simply ment to be.
This movie displays one familys struggle with these concepts when there world, and way of life is threaten by an outside force and it appears that God has abandoned them.
Many people have attacked Mel Gibson's portrayal of a father, a reverend who has lost his faith, as a weak attempt at acting, but he is simply playing a man who is still in shock and grieving at the recent loss of his wife.  Joaquin Phoenix (Mel's younger brother) is excellent in this film giving it much needed comic relief and providing both hope and faith in the face of his brother's dispair.  The two children are also delightful and the cast comes together well as a family.

1476608,5,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is the next thriller, offered by director/writer/producer, M. Night Shyamalan, who also made ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"".
PLOT SUMMARY: ""Signs"" takes place in the rural farm area of Pennsylvania, where a retired Preacher lives with his two children and younger brother. Mel Gibson stars as Father Graham Hess, who has lost all Faith in God ever since his wife died in a terrible car accident. One day, Graham thinks his children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) are missing in the corn fields. He and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), go out searching for them and discover the legendary Crop Circles in the field. At first, Graham and Merrill insist that it's nothing but teenagers playing jokes, but things start getting creepy when they watch TV and find out that Crop Circles are being found all across the Globe, according to the mysterious news that keeps on being repeated on every single radio station and television channel. When the family dogs start acting up, they are put outside and not much later, one of them dies. Other strange occurences that happen on the farm are that they keep on getting strange signals from Morgan's walkie talkie and someone--or something--has been tresspassing onto their land every night. Morgan keeps on insisting that it's ""extra terrestrials"" trying to make contact with Earth, but Graham won't believe it. However, when nothing else in Graham's theories seem to work, it all adds up to the fact that maybe--just MAYBE--Morgan might be right.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: M. Night Shyamalan has taken the elements of religion, science, fiction, and even a little bit of horror, twisted them together, and turned them (along with top-notch acting performances, great special effects, and a superb storyline), into a spectacular and spooky film. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances to-date, as the retired minster who's lack of self-belief in religion really nearly drives him to insanity with the Crop Circles. Joaquin Phoenix also gives a superb performance as Graham's younger brother who came to live with the family after Graham's wife died. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are amazing as the kids who believe what's really causing the Crop Circles to form are aliens trying to give Earth signals, as there are only a limited number of them and they are basically the same. The supporting cast does well, too...and M. Night Shyalaman even makes an appearence in the supporting cast, as he usually does in his films. The special effects are wonderful, and the storyline and plot are solid and strong--holds your interest to the very end. A real ""thinker's film"", and still manages to keep you entertained...and maybe even a little spooked.
The DVD includes a nice package of extras including a six-part documentary on the making of the film, five deleted scenes, storyboards, and a featurette on Shyalaman's first alien film. The DVD is available in wide screen format.
I highly recommend ""Signs"".

I thought that I would be enlightened, amazed and/or entertained. Instead, I just felt ripped off.

Oh, give me a huge break. Compound fracture, even! It's not even scary--more like pathetic.

This movie really didn't connect at all.  I must have lost the idea somewhere.  The characters are emotionally charged and the acting is great but the storyline just doesn't hold up.  The director introduces us to the main character a preacher who had lost his wife.  The night she died he lost his faith in God.  When the sightings of the UFO's appear the news says they are gathering around churches.  Why?  I asked myself the same question.  I thought this movie might have had some religous message or signifigance, but if it did it didn't show itself.
The aliens make a very brief appearance yet the stroyline tells us they play a very big part in the movie. I am not a big action freak but when there is action going on in a movie I like to see it and not be shut in the dark.

1476667,4,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's movie Signs is another minimalist shocker movie.  Unlike the Friday the 13th, 13 Ghosts movies with dumb unoriginal plots and gross out special effects, Night returns to older style movie theatrics used by Hitchcock.  The small cast is well acted by all; Mel Gibson is in a role that could have been played by Night's favorite male lead, Bruce Willis.  The children, also another theme in Night's movie, are well cast including Rory Culkin yet another Culkin child actor with real chops, and Abigail Breslin in her first movie.  They prove yet again that Night is an excellent director of children. Joaquin Phoenix has a very strong performance as the younger brother of Gibson, and produces a subtle and humorous performance.
The movie, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, has the same understated tone and colors of his hit ""The Sixth Sense"".  He sufficiently delays the actual alien confrontation till the very end with minimal snippets to tease the viewer.  The ending does tie things up very conveniently and is the only real problem with the movie.

The expectation of this movie going in is nothing close to what actually happens in the movie. Gibson's performance is sub par against movies like ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Braveheart"".
A family living on a farm notices crop circles in their cornfield. After thinking it is a vandal, they determine it is a sign for something else. Without giving the movie away it turns out to be a life or death situation for all mankind.
The acting in this movie...wait there was none. Every actor had the same expression, none. There was not one smile or laugh in the whole movie. Everyone had a serious look and mood to them for the whole movie.
Overall this movie had the feel of a low budget horror flick with a big name actor. I rate it a 2 out of 5. I only give it a two for the suspense. It does keep you in the movie engaging you to know what is going on.",1044057600,,967,4.148936170212766
1476669,3,B00005JL3T,"The beginning of this movie might make you wonder whether this is ""The River II"", with Mel Gibson once again becoming a farmer.  However, this time the antagonist isn't a river, but aliens.  It seems as though aliens have become the easy path to creation an antagonistic foil for any modern movie where you can't come up with a better antagonist.
Mel Gibson plays a former minister who lost his faith when his wife was killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel (played by the director of the movie).  On top of this we have a son with asthma, various people with problems of their own, and aliens with apparently wimpy technology if they can travel invisibly, jump onto the roof of a house, and yet struggle with getting through a wooden door of the house.
Portions of the movie are truly eerie, and for a little while you might find the movie frightening.  However, by the time you reach the final credits, the director has required too many suspensions of logic and belief to make the movie truly satisfying.  I would enjoy detailing some of the more significant lapses of logic, but some people have enjoyed this movie, and in the event you are one of those, I do not wish to spoil it for you.  I'll just say that the director asks us to believe by the abilities and actions of these aliens that they are incredibly superior beings, yet these same aliens appear to have incredible weaknesses that might have work in the 1950s, but for the significantly more sophisticated audience of the new millennium, the solid core of technology needed to support this movie just isn't there.
Another down side of the movie for me was that in addition to the logic inconsistencies, he tried to develop too many central characters without sufficient depth for us to become truly sympathetic to them.  Instead we have too many details in too short a time, thrown in with aliens that perhaps we didn't need.  The antagonist just as easily could have been Big Foot and the lapses in logic might have been fewer.
Giving M. Night Shymalan credit for the few moments when I felt the movie was suspenseful, but taking away credit for the multiple implausibilities (it's hard to believe that aliens navigating between solar systems would require crop signs as navigation aids - give me a break; maybe they should go to Radio Shack or Sears and buy GPS systems), I can only give this movie three stars.

It was a hodgepodge of stolen concepts from E.T., The War of the Worlds, and believe it or not The Wizard of OZ with a very weak storyline and marginal performances.
It went on & on & on and kept hinting that something interesting was just a scene away.  I guess that scene must have been dropped on the cutting room floor because it ain't in the flick!
The ending was insulting, childish and has been used before when a certain ""Wicked Witch"" gets hers.  I'm all for the suspension of belief in order to enjoy fiction...but give the viewer something to half-believe in!  The idea that an advanced alien race has come half way across the universe to take over a world of which 75% is comprised of a fatal poison is way to far to stretch my imagination.

1476674,2,B00005JL3T,"Mr. Shyamalan is obviously a strong director and a real movie buff. Who knows what compelled him to apparently draw upon ""Contact"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Birds"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""The Wizard Of Oz"", and whatever else and hand us a very pretentious movie. He even finds a part for himself in the plot - he's the person who fell asleep at the wheel and ended the life of Mrs. Hess and temporarily ended the religious career of Mr. Hess - Mel Gibson. (At least his idol Mr. Hitchcock got himself out of the proceedings after his ""cameo"").
Mel and Joaqhim are the two bemused male leads. Don't think ""Men are back"" in the movies - they are both lost figures, one abandoning his faith after a tragedy, one a shoulda-been ballplayer. Gibson's children basically run the household with help from a local Policewoman.
Gibson's faith is tested a second time when crop circles, I mean really big ones hoaxters couldn't do, show up in front of his country home. His suspicions are validated when he encounters an alien on the other side of the pantry door in the home of the guy who ran down Mrs. Hess. This creature was able defy universal laws of physics by traveling galaxies to Earth and by creating the circles - It was nice of him to let Earthlings know he was coming to destroy their planet - but he can't seem to find his way out of the broom closet.
After the attack has begun and Hess, his Brother, his Son and Daughter, board themselves up at home to cower and wish away the aliens. Hess' son is aesthmatic and has an attack. His inhaler is in the other room - where an alien is. Gibson's character in this scene shows no ""Lethal Weapon"" tendencies. He curls and with his son on the floor. Eventually, his Brother grabs his Louisville Slugger and pummels the creature (who resembles a hybrid of the Jolly Green Giant and Alien). But it's H20 which does it in. Yes, this creature who can fly through space and scan his destination for spots to make a crop circle apparently missed that this place is 75% of what destroys him. A few bottles of water tip over...and he's gone just like the Wicked Witch from you know what movie. In the end, though, they all lived happily ever after. Hess bounces out the door with renewed vigor and interest in his work. (The fact that half the Earth is wiped out doesn't seem to affect him). The DVD offers production sidelights including an interview with the Director. He seems to be saying that the message of the movie is that order comes from chaos and that we should contemplate Universal harmony even as discord prevails. It's food for thought, but I assume that many others agree with me that despite the effective suspense, and the chance to see Mel Gibson do something different, it's wrong to take the audience for granted - Science Fiction has to have grounding in *reality*.

To sum it up, it is about a famliy who own a farm.  All of a sudden there are crop circles in their fields.  Later they hear on the news that all around the world people are reporting crop circles and pets are acting strangly.  A few days latter people discover flying UFO's and the ""invasion"" begins.  The famliy decides to stay at their farm and board up their house, knowing the alieans physical limitations.  The family does survive, and you find out that a prophecy of Mel Gibson's wife has meaning and helps them survive.
It also has a underlying story of a minister who looses his faith once his wife dies, and through the course of the events, he see's that nothing happens by chance and their is ""someone""(god) looking out for them.  This is what makes up the feeling of satisfaction in the movie, with all the other bad things happining.
This movie did take up a new style of movie making, where the characters talk in short sentences.  I have seen other movies do this, and while this is not that much of a big deal whereas others were very anoying, it does leave something to be desired with the lacked of Verbal character development.
The music is very suspenseful, and is appropriate to the movie's atmosphere.
The movie also has a little humor, which i liked and thought helped progress the movie along.
I would recommend this movie to anyone above 9 years old, because, this movie might(and probably will) scare young children.

Director Shymalan really shows us the effectiveness of the ""less is more"" idea.  Throughout most of the movie, he doesn an incredible job of building up a sense of dread.  We spend much of the movie on the edge of our seats, waiting for something horrible to happen.  There are many wonderful moments when we can almost feel the dread the family is going through.  We sense the tension in the family, as well as the love, and of course, the fear of dying.  Near the end, when they are down in their cellar, all the lights go out. That's a terrifying moment, not because the lights went out, but because of all the tension leading up to it, and the worst thing that could happen if FOR THE LIGHTS TO GO OUT, because we've just GOT to see what's happening!!!
Joacquin Phoenix is very good in the movie, playing a more ordinary guy than he's been asked to in a long time.  Mel Gibson, although retaining some of his usual mannerisms, is effecitve and touching.  The kids are great.  The editing and cinematography are first rate, and Shymalan the DIRECTOR does everything right.
Shymalan the writer lets us down BIG TIME.  I'm sorry, but the ending is very disappointing.  We've had a terrific build up through 95% of the movie, but the final couple of scenes are just a huge letdown.  Never have I said ""THAT'S IT????""  with more disappointment and fervor.  I highly recommend the movie, and think most will enjoy it, but just be prepared for a payoff that doesn't rival THE SIXTH SENSE's or even UNBREAKABLE's.

1) Why in the name of all logic and reason would aliens that have travelled in cloaked spaceships from stars of unmeasurable distances away think that the best way to take over a planet is with hand to hand combat?
2) OK, that aside for the sake of interesting storyline, but what the ... is up with the idea that these beings would come to a planet where not only is 3/4th of the surface, but 98% of the beings inhabiting it are made up of a substance that EATS THROUGH THEIR SKIN!!...""Come on Alien Bob we're all gonna down and camp out on the acid world, wanna come?!""
I mean this is aside from the illogical idea that this fundamental building block of life is duracell juice to these chameleon cross-breeds, but you would really think that they would protect themselves against it, or at least HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT!

  We have a cleric who ""lost his faith"" after the death of his wife, an alien invasion, and crop-circles; -- 1-2-3,3-2-1,3-1-2,2-3-1, etc., ever puts this Humpty together.
  Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of Earth's dust-mote status in the vastness of the universe knows full well that our planet is far from being a desirable target for aliens to attack, and to suggest that crop circles are some sort of ""landing-lights"" for alien crafts is simply puerile fantasy.

1476883,4,B00005JL3T,"I see there is an ongoing argument concerning this film. I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend it as an enjoyable film. This one had significantly less philosophy behind it as seen in The Sixth Sense, which was magnificent. But my husband and I enjoyed the subplot concerning the loss of the farmer's wife in such a traumatic way, and her final comments to her devastated husband. Her loss triggers his own doubt of God's presence in our lives. But everything she told her husband (Gibson) at the end and in flashbacks, had a meaning which he could not see until the he experiences the signs in his cornfield and the following events involving his remaining family.
The director takes it for granted that viewers will know something concerning the rash of 'signs' created in a variety of places growing corn stalks. That may be a bit of a problem for someone coming into the movie with no knowledge of the connection originally made with these occurences...that extraterrestials made them, and not human beings with too much time on their hands.
Gibson...well, what can  you say. He surprised me again. He's known to be such a practical joker and so many of his films have been humorous, or he injects his own sense of humor and his ability to see life from different points of view (even a childlike faith that is damaged and then mended). When I watch him in a film now, I always expect him to be a certain type of character, but I never expected him in something as serious as this particular character or as a minister.
Phoenix, as Gibson's brother, who comes to be with him when he loses his wife, is absolutely great. So were the kids. I totally get the panicked awakening of Gibson when his young daughter stands at his bedside silently. My own kids have pulled that one on me. I also used to do it to my own parents, to make sure they were still there.
There is more humor in this film, and it isn't as dark as his last film. There are a couple of parts in the film I'll always remember...first, where the two grownups run around the house screaming threats because they think punks are playing tricks on them. Then the picture of the two children with foil cones on their heads, with their uncle in between them, also wearing a foil cone. Just extremely funny, in an unfunny situation.
So it's not deep...big deal. It's very entertaining, and the subplot about faith was more than worth the money and the time to watch it.

1476887,4,B00005JL3T,"In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films.  Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.
The story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan's remarkable sense of visual style.  Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife's tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield.  He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities.  But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.
The small cast is extremely, extremely good.  I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown tremendously since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well.  Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson's younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.
What isn't flawless is the story.  The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn't quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film's religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick.  I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it's a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film's conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed.

And that's what's so disappointing about Signs, all of the actors are good and put in nice performances, but they have absolutely no story to work with.
Signs borrows heavily from two genre-defining horror films: Night of the Living Dead and the Exorcist.  It borrows its location, suspenseful moments and narrative devices from Night of the Living Dead: the cast boards itself into a farm house, is assaulted by horrible enemies with its only link to the outside world being the television.  It borrows its main theme from the Exorcist as Mel Gibson struggles, and regains his faith confronting his assailants.
The first ""signs"" of trouble are the news broadcast detailing the alien invasion - they are so poorly acted and executed - you'll think high school students filmed them.  The first broadcast is so out of place with the professional delivery of the main cast, that the viewer is immediately put on notice that corners were cut making the film - and the whole show loses credibility from that point on.

It takes someone who is a GENIOUS, in my book, to make a movie that pushes all the right emotional buttons and makes the viewer react at all the right places.

1476956,2,B00005JL3T,"I wanted to like this film, I really did.  The director had shown real skill in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, both excellent films with haunting characters and engaging scripts.  I'd seen the previews for ""Signs,"" and it looked, well, scary...not in that Halloweeny way where you never know what's going to jump out at you, but in a more psychological way.  Scary like you're not sure what is happening.  Scary like ""did I really see that?""
And while the movie does visually approach its alien characters in this way, the psychological drama is missing here.  It is, alas, simply a rather flat, predictable story of a minister regaining his faith through the crucible of an alien attack.
For Shyamalan, the ""signs"" of the title are not the crop circles that mysteriously appear on Gibson's farm; those are simply, absurdly, needed to help the next wave of aliens navigate the planet.  No, what this movie is concerned with are the ""signs"" of the Judeo-Christian god, as described in the bible:  ""How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the SIGNS which I have performed in their midst?""
""There are two types of people in the world,"" says Mel Gibson's character.  He goes on to explain that the first type believe that this world is all there is, and that your experiences in life are merely chance and luck; and then there's the type that believe there is Someone watching over you, guiding you- the type that believes in miracles and has faith that nothing happens merely by coincidence.  Gibson's character, a former minister now angry at his deity for the untimely death of his wife, is supposed to be showing us the pitfalls of those in the first category: the non-believers.  His newfound renunciation of his faith won't let him ""waste one more minute of my life on prayer,"" even though his kids desperately need the comfort that comes from that kind of magical thinking.  The writing is so biased and juvenile, however, that all he shows us is how immature and self-centered an angry theist can be.
The potential viewer should be warned, however.  The intent of the script is to belittle skeptics and non-believers, showing them to be powerless and full of fear in the face of the unknown, unable to meet the needs of others under pressure.  Only those who believe there is a god watching over them, giving them ""signs"" to decipher and use in their daily life, can truly know what to do when faced with unforeseen events and challenges.  Shyamalan has purposely turned what could have been a touching story on one man's spiritual reawakening, into a condemnation of ALL those who find it difficult to believe that a caring supreme being is watching over us and lovingly intervening in our lives by causing fatal car crashes and giving small children asthma.
Admittedly, there are a couple of good scenes and a couple of good scares in this movie, in keeping with the tradition of the genre.  But for skeptics, the occasional thrill is probably not worth putting up with the continuous, pounding agony of the pompous religious message hitting you over the head.",1043020800,4,3118,4.7481481481481485

1477079,2,B00005JL3T,"This film is an incredibly unimaginative interpretiation of an alien invasion.  I would be willing to overlook this fact if the direction and plot weren't so mundane.  Here's the premise: A single Dad and his kids see crop circles, 15 mins later the planet is invaded by little gray men.  All the while the ""Reverend"" is questioning his religion.  WOW! how imaginitive. >>>(Side-thought) These aliens can attempt to take over a planet but they can't break down a pantry door? People who like this movie try to sugar coat it by saying there is a whole lot of religous meaning in it. FOOEY!
And what's wrong with the kids?  They look and act brain dead.  I guess the tin foil hats didn't work, right?
Character development was terrible.  I felt no connection to any of the characters, especially the guy played by Joaquin Pheonix.  But I guess that's not what the movie was about.  It was about 13-16 year olds going to the movies and seeing little gray men torment a cute family.
If you have no imagination and are completly naive about the whole 'alien' thing, then you will be thrilled, surprised and delighted by this film.
But if you have even the slightest bit of imagination, or foresight, you'll predict every part of the movie before it happens.
Rumor has it that Bruce Willis was originally cast to play the part of the Dad.  He would have been perfect.  I wish he had played the part so that the much better actor (Gibson) wouldn't have stained his carrer with this E.T./Close Encounters knock-off dribble.

Sure, you'll have to suspend some disbelief during the viewing-if you are not gifted with this ability, you will hate this film. The alien invaders cannot withstand water-hard to imagine the horde not running into some thru condensation or moist ground on a farm, but, to be fair, Night notes the problem, and has most of them land in less arable parts of the world. Sure, there's a moral, and cynical folk will loathe it. But to me, it was just a plot device, regardless of the writer's intent. The moral being, there is something watching over us-things do happen for a reason. Of course they don't, but you won't care during Signs, it's just cool to wath all the coincidences fall into place that help Gibsons character return to faith. Everyone delivers all their lines with deadpan comedy, putting you at ease with that which wouldn't add up on its own. Maybe that was it, there were serious elements, but the director knew well enough to be aware of the entertainment value of the film, and not it's philosophical value or whatever it is that people mysteriously search for in movies to explain humanity and existence.

I was very impressed by the acting is this film aswell with all the actors being very convincing in their roles. When watching this movie, the audience doesn't feel like they're watching Mel Gibson playing Graham Hess. They're watching Graham Hess. This rings true for all the actors in the film. Especially the children who both blew me away with their acting. Unbelievable. The audience cannot ask for more than that.
As for people being dissapointed about no twist... i think it makes a refreshing change from 99% of movies around today, but this is certainly not to say the movie is predictable. The ending is brilliant, bringing the movie full circle and not leaving the audience full of questions like many films.

I thought that the movie was really suspenseful, and it kept me guessing until the end.  I've read some reviewers saying that this movie is corny, and has some obvious holes in the plot.  Well duh, there are very few movies of this kind that don't have gaps in logic, but sometimes you have to suspend your disbelief for an hour and a half and just enjoy a movie.  I think that the absolute best thing about this movie is what is not shown to you.  Shyamalan took a lesson from Hitchcock and shows that your mind does a much better job of scaring you than pouring gallons of blood across the screen.
As for the DVD extras, it is pretty standard fare.  Deleted scenes, interviews, and documentaries, nothing that I was super impressed with, but I haven't yet bought a DVD based upon the awesome documentaries that go with it.
Buy this DVD is you are a fan of Shyamalan's movies.",1042848000,6,985,4.3497267759562845
1477131,5,B00005JL3T,"Great film.  Shyalaman wonderfully builds up the tension by directing this is though it could actually happen.  He lets your imagination create the suspense (which it invariably will) by subscribing to ""less is more"" filmaking.  Rather than revealing ""them,"" he allows them to lurk just out of sight.  Viewers catch only glimpses of some haunting presence.
As far as the DVD goes, I was a bit disappointed that this wasn't packaged as the earlier Vista series releases were, with a fold-out card-stock design.  It looks out of place next to Tombstone, Unbreakable, and The Sixth Sense on my shelf.  A cost-cutting measure perhaps?  Each of those previous Vista series releases featured 2 discs, one containing the film and the other containing all the special features.  I can only guess that the 1-disc release is another cost-cutting decision....
The DVD's cover is also a bit disappointing.  I preferred the original movie poster art that depicted the crop signs leading up the the house in the distance.  M. Night preferred this as well, as he reveals in the special features for Signs.  He made sure there were not Mel Gibson shots like the studio wanted, because he reasoned (and rightly so) that this was not a movie about Mel, but a film that stands on its own.  I like very much his views on this subject.  I can't stand movies like this that feature a huge shot of one of the stars rather than a well-done piece of design the truly illustrates the movie.

1477132,5,B00005JL3T,"Let me start by saying, I love this film. It is a sci-fi masterpiece, a throwback to the classic sci-fi flicks of the 50s. Now, before you watch this movie, please keep that in mind. It has more in common with a movie like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" than it does with ""Independance Day"" or ""Alien.""
The tension builds and fills the film like a massive lead weight that sits right on your heart as it thuds in your chest. You won't see lots of shooting, blood and gore. You will see a masterpiece of film-making unfold before your eyes.
The problem with this movie, or perhaps rather the other reviewers of this movie who put it down, is that it does not fit in with modern sci-fi expectations. There's not lots of CG effects, blood, aliens being blown to bits and lasers beams flying everywhere. It's not a story line hung loosely around a collection of mayhem, death and destruction in a sci-fi enviroment.
No, the problem is this movie is smart. It approaches fear in a way that is subtle, not in your face. It's not the junk food that movie audiences have been fed over the last few decades. It wants you to think more of it's characters than of the war. To me, this movie is more about the family it revolves around than the actual invasion. The alien invasion just serves as a backdrop for the story of a man's faith in God.
I especially like the duality of the title. ""Signs"" refers both to the crop circles left by the alien invaders, and the signs from God that Mel Gibson talks over in a great piece of dialogue with co-star Joaquin Phoenix. Both of these stars are first rate in this film.
As for the aliens, they seem to draw much criticism as well. I think M. Night wanted them to be an enigma. He accomplished that very well. Why did they act the way they did? I don't know. They were aliens! Hollywood has been spoon feeding us so much junk in sci-fi trappings, we've forgotten how to consume a REAL sci-fi movie.
In closing, I am giving this DVD five stars. I would give it 4.5 if possible. The movie is a five star affair, but I was disappointed in the extras. No trailers, and the behind the scenes parts were a bit dry. The deleted scenes were good however. If you want a true, tense, sci-fi movie and a character driven story, buy this! If you want lots of explosions and blood, you came to the wrong place, but check it out anyway, you might be surprised how much you like it.",1042848000,3,2401,4.30242825607064
1477133,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is another one of those summer 2002 movies that I was unfortunately able to make it to.  That was a regrettable mistake.  Signs, from director M. Night Shyamalan is a mellow yet gripping, edge of your seat thriller in the strongest sense of the term.  Although I'd heard several disparaging remarks about this film, I'm quite glad that I'd not listened to them.  This film is a fine addition to your DVD collection!
The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS
Mel Gibson stars as a farmer and former pastor whose lost his wife due to a horrible auto accident and consequently he's lost his faith in God.  He wakes up one morning to find that his two young children are out of the house and screaming.  On his way out of the house, he runs in to his brother, played by Joaquin Phoenix (of Gladiator fame).  They frantically search for and find them in the corn field where crop ""signs"" have been emblazoned in his corn crops.
What follows from this point is clearly one of the finest suspense/thriller films this viewer has watched in quite some time.  As writer, director and actor, M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a fine film that in no uncertain terms will quickly bring you into it emotionally and leave you exhausted at the end.  Of particular note is the older style of movie making where the director does not immediately put the special effects right in your face.  For the better part, until the end of the movie, he leaves much of the suspense to the imagination.  In doing this, he creates even more suspense for the viewer than any other format might've done.
The musical score for the film lends perfectly to every scene, from the mellow to the highly dramatic.  Helping with the score for the home viewer is the THX format.",1042848000,7,1726,4.564935064935065

Don't get me wrong: The acting by everyone in the movie is great, and the pain and the resolving of the loss of faith of the central character played by Mel Gibson, and the rest of the characters entwined, is quite moving. The ending of the film is anticlimatic. Not bad. Just very low key. Symbolic without any explanations -- doesn't need any. Sometimes I realize that the very thing that one person dislikes about the film may be what I would like. If an alien invasion seeming flimsy in its portrayal because the movie is focusing so hard on the emotional pain of a family, and a hanging question -- ""Is nothing a coincidence?"" -- doesn't bother you, then maybe you should buy it. This film takes you through the experience of a family: You live it with them. That is something no one can truly describe or do for you.

I get the feeling that some of these dyspeptic reviewers are too young to remember the classic old horror movies that contained space invasion elements, such as the origional ""Thing"", and so many others that entranced me when I was a child. Over and over I would watch, as the scary invader/monster/whatever finally made an appearance. Over and over I was relieved to see the humans triumph over the threat to the world. This was a genuine plot device that thrilled people in the fifties because of the pinko fears that threaded through our lives--we thought we were going to be blown up by the Communists.
At any rate, horror movies were not significantly about storyline or character development, in the long run: it was cathartic entertainment.  That's right, you watched it to get  scared and, and then to get rid of your Commie fears and finally to be entertained that way.  Plus, it's human nature to like to be jumped. I don't understand it--maybe it's an adrenaline thing.

1477192,3,B00005JL3T,"One of the problems that I had with SIGNS was to classify it.  Parts of it reminded me of standard aliens-attack-earth thrillers, new age spiritual discovery epics, and hide-out-in-the-basement horror shows from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Director M. Night Shyalaman tries with middling success to meld this variety of genres into what he clearly hoped was a thriller. Instead, what he presents is a movie that hides a sea of logical flaws behind several scenes that are effective nail biters.  These flaws become more apparent only after the closing credits roll, and the viewer takes the time to digest what he just saw.
SIGNS portrays a world that suffers from a crisis of moral defection.  Mel Gibson is a priest whose wife dies horribly in front of his eyes, thereby causing him to lose faith in the power of prayer and the omnipotence of a benevolent God.  While he struggles with this crisis of conscience, the earth is invaded by a race of decidedly low-tech aliens who are so fumble-fingered that the viewer wonders how these plug-uglies could cross the street unaided, let alone bridge the intergalactic gap between the stars.  In a scene ripped straight out of George Romero, director Shyalaman locks Gibson, his brother Joaquin Phoenix, and Gibson's two young children into a basement with only a radio to fill them in on the details of the ongoing crisis.  Not content with that, Shyalaman then goes to the morally uplifting ending of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS to punctuate the belief that what distinguishes humanity from all hostile ETs is our fundamental belief in a higher power that tells us that all elements in our lives are intertwined in a spiritual tapestry that does not allow for unlikely coincidence.  Gibson and Phoenix, however, are surprisingly effective in reacting to a claustrophobic house that comes under alien assault.
After watching this movie, I concluded that if the next alien invasion were to happen along the lines of SIGNS, then human beings have little to fear from a bunch of aliens who could learn a much needed lesson from John Wayne in how to kick a door down.",1042588800,3,2103,4.838440111420613
1477193,4,B00005JL3T,"Cliff Notes: Signs Movie Musings
M. Night Shyamalan's latest film is hard to categorize. Part philosophizing, part science fiction (or is it about the supernatural instead? heh, heh), part horror, part ... in the end, the best description is suspense, because a good part of the movie is ""guess what the plot is really about"" - not necessarily a bad thing.
I've read a lot of complaints about the film (although most critics liked it), but I'm convinced the complainants were simply not paying attention - strange, because although this film is relatively slow-paced (just a little faster than Unbreakable), you'll be glued to the screen. The script is well written and you'll be constantly wondering where the plot is going, what Mr. Shyamalan is trying to say. Is it about groundless paranoia? Will the military foolishly start a war? Are the strange creatures benevolent, malevolent, not aliens at all?
There seem to be two kinds of critics complaining about the film. The first kind does not get what the film is really about. They complain it's not great science fiction, that the plot devolves into chasing aliens, and so on. But these complaints only reveal that they have failed to grasp what this film is about.  Get this straight - it's not a science fiction movie. The sci-fi element is only there to provide a framework for the story, the means of telling a parable.
The second kind of critic gets the point of the film, but does not like it at all. Ironically, this is also what the film is about: denial.
At the core is a story about a pastor (Mel Gibson), someone whose whole life concerns faith, undergoing a crisis of faith - a battle which, at the outset, he has in fact lost - and the effects of that bitterness on himself and his family. (This leads to a couple of emotional outbursts which can be unsettling to younger viewers.) We are led to ask: does God really preside over our most painful moments? How could there possibly a good reason for some tragic, even horrific, events?
Then strange things begin to happen which seem at first to have no relation to this plot whatsoever. Strange figures scamper around his homestead. Crop circles appear in his cornfields. His dogs have a hard time of it. What is happening? Thus begins Mr. Shyamalan's roundabout journey about faith, despair, life's meaning (or the lack thereof), denial, and hope, seasoned with dashes of fright and suspense.
In the first part of the film, the ex-pastor , Father Hess, explains that he has lost his faith because of a terrible accident, in which a loved one's dying words open his eyes to the meaninglessness and randomness of life. But at the end, we see that he has not been entirely honest with himself, and it is this realization that could be their salvation. So another message of this movie is that unbelief is not necessarily a choice born of reason but from bitterness, a choice which can thereafter radically skew our view of reality.
There is also an interesting dialogue between the main character and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) concerning ""two groups of people,"" and how their outlook on life affects their lives. The clarity of this exchange will be disturbing to those who deny God yet continue to live as though their lives can still have meaning, trying to drown out the logical conclusion of their views: absurdity and hopelessness.
The characters are interesting and sympathetic, with the kids providing comedy in their serious, childlike way. A tragic death is described and partially shown without graphic detail or gore; as mentioned above, there are a couple of intense emotional flashes. An extraterrestrial being loses a couple of fingers.

For all of you that say the ending was dull, I feel sorry for you.  The ending was the best part of the movie.  Graham Hess realizing the ""SIGNS"" God was sending him of His existance.  God warned him thru his dying wife.  God made his children the way they were so the family could survive this ordeal.  God made it possible for his brother to be there to help fight this battle.

This is nothing like the other alien movies where everything is blunt and direct. This one has a sublety that makes you believe this could really happen. It keeps you wide eyed and on the edge of your seat. And I for one thought Mel Gibson was believable and anything but boring!!

1477197,3,B00005JL3T,"At the risk of adding to the some 507 rants on this page, I'm going to add my two cents to the debate. Signs was neither the worst movie that I've ever seen in my life, nor the best. But it was a disappointment, as it revealed that one of the most startlingly talented directors to come around the the last few years may have been a one-hit wonder. Shamalyan's Sixth Sense was a beauty of a movie, creepy without being gory, beautifully acted (even by Bruce Willis, who I usually think is pretty wooden) and with a twist ending that illuminates the entire movie. Even now that I've seen it several times, the ending is still powerful and changes the movie from a mere ghost story to a work of art. Unbreakable, Shamalyan's followup, was hugely disappointing to me. There was tons of creepy atmosphere but 'surprise' ending felt like a cheat rather than a revelation.
Signs suffers from the same drawbacks as Unbreakable, though it is a better movie I think. First of all, the performances are better from Gibson, Phoenix and the kids...especially the little girl. But the whole premise of the movie begins to creak about half way through (I'm trying not to give away the ending here, so I apologize if I'm a bit nebulous.) and by the end, I don't much care about any of it.
My biggest problem with this movie, however, is it's vacuous spiritual viewpoint. The emotional center of the story revolves around Mel Gibson, a former clergyman who lost his faith when his wife was killed in a truly horrifying accident. The spiritual message of this movie is that everything happens for a reason and events that look superficially tragic can end up as blessings. This sounds good...we moderns like this because it comforts us in the the face of the senseless tragedies of contemporary life. But as presented in this movie, the theological issues are full of holes. (DON'T READ ANY FARTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING) Shamalyan imagines a world in which people are puppets in some way, in which the tragic death of Gibson's wife provides the seeds that save the rest of his family. But it ignores the suffering of others. Are we to assume that somehow there's meaning and purpose to Gibson's life that others who were slaughtered didn't possess? Are some people allowed miracles while others are just fodder for invading aliens? This kind of thological view point actually turns to jelly when looked at closely.
While I can't state it unequivocally, I believe this viewpoint to be actually erroneous and even dangerous. It leads to a feeling that some people are more ""special"" to God or whomever, than others. The message of most religions at there core, even Christianity, is not this at all. No one is more special to God than anyone else, and, while I do believe in an ultimate meaning behind all things, I'm not sure that the signs can be read as literally or as patly as in this movie. Real spirituality is a much deeper mystery than what is presented here.
Rant aside, I wouldn't say this is a movie that you should avoid. It's not horrible. But don't take it too seriously, especially it's ""spiritual"" point of view. The whole movie withers under any intellectual scrutiny.",1042588800,,3183,4.665480427046264

All of his trademark devices are there: kids in suspense, adults talking in whispers, cameo by the director, (where's Willis?) but while I love the idea of de-Spielbergizing ET, this comes off as an overlong episode of the Outer Limits.
It's OK, just I don't get the fuss. Mel Gibson seems bent on tackling Michael Caine's ""I'll do any movie"" approach toward film roles, and while he is quite believable, one misses the edge he used to bring to roles. Phoenix is excellent, and really the best thing about this film. The corn fields in Doylestown are beautiful.

Joaquin Phoenix does an admirable job in his attempt to create a fully realized human being, despite being saddled with some foolish dialogue, and the director himself makes a strong impression in a pivotal cameo, but Mel Gibson's performance is artificial and overbearing.  His overacting in the dinner table scene made me absolutely cringe--it truly borders on embarrassing.  Not for a moment did I believe his characterization, which was one of the greatest disappointments of the film.

His loss is so deep, that he gives up his practice and denounces God.  His children are attempting to cope with their grief and their father's.  Their uncle (Joaquin Phoenix), a washed up baseball player is staying with them in an effort to help the family.

The thing about this movie is that it is so torturingly bad that one comes out the other end so demoralized as not to be able to think coherently, let alone deliver a bad review.  The movie centers around a crisis of faith and, ironically, it engenders a crisis of faith in me, the viewer, whose faith in mankind is shaken to its core by the fact that anyone can have tolerated this movie.  Not content with being thumpingly bad, the film also wallows in being far ickier than any of the preposterously crummy aliens we get a load of.  Mel Gibson plays a Catholic priest, with a wife and children no less, who flakes out on his religious routine after his wife is killed in a car accident.  We get to watch endless flashbacks of his wife's dying moments at the crash site.  This is so tasteless as to be mind-boggling.  It is as if this sort of thing is reasonable entertainment - something to take in while eating popcorn and taking down two big gulps that you smuggled into the theater from 7-11.  Well, apparently Father Gibson's phony faith can't take much jostling and it comes down like the house of cards it is, with Mel saying that ""there is no one watching out for us"" as if religiousness were a matter of God performing favors for you and, if you come to find it hard to believe that this is going on, since things are not going your way, you lose all religious belief.  Then, later in the movie, God seems to have woken up and started performing favors for Father Gibson again, and so he merrily dons his collar and whistles off to tend his flock again, presumably brimming with bonhomie about what a good sport God is and how recently God seems to have ensured that the tune-up given his SUV was extra-special.

1477365,2,B00005JL3T,"It comes as no surprise that 'Signs' by M. Night Shyamalan became the fourth highest grossing film of 2002, making this blockbuster the director's most successful project to date.  Favoring the creepy/suspenseful sci-fi genre once again, Shyamalan's previous two hits 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' made 'Signs' one of the most highly anticipated releases of the year.  And just watch the six-part documentary that talks about the movie's marketing for further proof.
Shyamalan's third film delves into the question of 'Are aliens really out there?  And how would we know?'  He uses some interesting camera work and absence of background music in several scenes to set the mood for the mystery that is set to unravel itself.  However, there are some parts in the film where he seems to use the same setup way too much.  Another big pitfall in the film is the goofy comic relief that frequently cuts into the story.  Humor is fine and everything, but put it in the wrong places and you have a film that chokes and slows itself down.
Let's not also forget the large gaps in logic!  At the end of the film, a television news program reports that the aliens have all fled due to a secret weapon that was discovered by middle-easterners.  The audience is then led to infer that the secret weapon is none only than - water!  Sounds like Shyamalan couldn't think of a proper ending, so he made up something quick to give the film a conclusion.  What I don't understand is how the aliens could have arrived on the planet to begin with, since our atmosphere has humidity in it and therefore is surrounded by water.
One last point, the film made itself even worse by actually revealing what the aliens looked like.  It would have been much more suspenseful to have kept the extra-terrestrials hidden or running around briefly rather than to have had the camera fixate on a guy in a rubber alien suit.  The alien's cartoonish appearance was almost.. laughable.
What I did enjoy about this film was its scenery and the use of lighting to create a mood.  The crop circles looked like they were very difficult to create, and scenes like the chase around the crop field kept the audience guessing.
>>> 2 stars.  This film just did not do it for me.  I thought the acting was better than average, especially the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Mel Gibson, but could not save the movie from its leaky plotline.  All comparisons of Shyamalan to Hitchcock or Spielburg will have to wait.  The man still has a long way to go.  Hopefully, his next project will give the audience a film as gripping and genius as 'The Sixth Sense'.

1477366,1,B00005JL3T,"...  Mel Gibson plays a former reverend who has lost his faith in God and is annoyed with having to constantly remind everyone not to call him ""Father"" anymore.  The reason for his lapsed faith is the death of his wife in a car accident (I guess we are to assume that ministers pretty much think that they're exempt from human tragedy just because they're ""men of God?"").  The accident involves a guy played by the film's director, M. Night Shyamalan, which I found to be the most potent symbolism of the entire movie:  Shyamalan does indeed drive this film into a car wreck.
Strange goings-on begin to occur at Reverend Mel's picture-perfect all-American rural Pennsylvania farmhouse (which, I kid you not, is actually painted in red, white and blue...do ya get the symbolism yet?  Well if you don't, hold on, because for the remainder of the film, Shyamalan beats everything over your head like an escapee from a mental institution wielding an oversized sledgehammer).  Mysterious giant crop circles suddenly begin to appear out in the back forty.  A mysterious figure materializes one night outside of his little oh-so-cute-and-adorable-elfin-like daughter's bedroom window, whom he and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) chase around the house.  Mel later catches a glimpse of something alien-like taking a leisurely evening stroll through his cornfield.
Meanwhile, the TV news is broadcasting stories of an epidemic of crop circles all over the world; an array of strange lights appear over several major cities; an E.T. crashes a kid's birthday party in Brazil (hey, maybe he just wanted to take a shot at the piata?). OH MY GOD, THE ALIENS ARE COMING TO GET US!!!
There is constant overemoting, with virtually every main character breaking down into tears at some point or other, an obvious and transparent ploy to try to trick the audience into making an emotional investment in the characters' conflict; this in absence of a compelling plot.
This film left me sorely disappointed in Shyamalan as a writer and director, since his first two features-""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable""-showed so much promise.  In both of those movies, he wisely chose that what is not said is far more powerful than what is said, and what the audience cannot see is far more disturbing than what they can see.  If he continues to explore that theme-unseen powers brewing beneath the surface-he will create a compelling body of work that sets him apart from his contemporaries.

If his goal was to create an entertaining science fiction tale with a compelling element of genuine human drama and something to say about the human condition, he should have rented ""Donnie Darko"" and taken some notes.",1042416000,4,2750,4.9803493449781655

1477371,5,B00005JL3T,"I've got no trouble saying that Signs is one of the 20 best movies ever made. M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite filmmakers  (I put The Sixth Sense in the top 50 movies). I've no doubt that as time goes on, he will be recognized as the next Hitchcock. Their styles are very familiar--both have tight control over their film, with as little takes and editing possible, and both allow the audience's imagination to do the work. Both treat the audience as an intelligent being, and not some mindless drone. We have a true talent with M. Night Shyamalan.
What makes Signs so great isn't the cgi (which Night doesn't like to use). It's the human drama, the story of this family, their hurt, and how they mend. And it is a story of faith--having it and losing it. It doesn't matter so much what is going on outside of the farmhouse, whether it is world war 3, an alien invasion, or just a hard winter. The true story is how these four family members interact with each other. First their is Mel Gibson, who plays an ex-reverend who lost his faith when his wife died. Gibson puts forth one of the strongest performances I've seen him give. It may be his finest performance. Joaquim Phoenix definitely gives the best performance of his career, as Gibson's younger brother. He's both strong and vulnerable. Rory Caulkin plays Gibson's son, and this may be Night's true talent, finding child actors and bringing such strong performances from them. But it is Abigail Breslin, who plays Gibson's daughter, who steals the show. She's an adorable child, who gives her lines with such a deadpan grace and humor. You can bet the best scenes, and some of the best lines, are hers. Rounding out the cast is M. Night Shyamalan (who gives a strong performance) and Cherry Jones as Officer Paski. What makes the movie so great is the mood Night evokes. The entire movie feels tragic, sad--it feels like the entire movie has been tinted blue. But through the movie's sorrow, Night still brings humor and hope. It's an emotionally charged movie. Combine that with James Newton Howard's amazing score (based on a three note motiff, evocative of Psycho) that never overpowers the movie, but enhances it. And the movies sound effects and dialogue mix perfectly with the music. The two never fight each other, but work together to give the viewer one of the best movie going experiences.
The Vista Series dvd is a great value. Shyamalan's dvds always contain the bare minimum, but you never feel cheated. In addition to a great movie, the Signs dvd gives you a few deleted scenes and another of Night's movies he made as a kid. This one, his first 'creature' movie. There's no commentary, but there is a six part making of featurette (here's the real value of the dvd). I've seen a lot of making of and behind the scenes documentaries and featurettes, but none of this quality. You don't need a commentary track with these featurettes. Part one covers the writing of the screenplay, two covers the building of the sets (including the corn), three is the longest (22 minutes) and is the 'making of' documentary, four covers the effects (which really only is the creature), five is last voices and deals with scoring the movie, and the final featurette, ""Full Circle"", Night covers the business aspects of filmmaking--the marketing.",1042329600,,3309,4.715025906735751

Mel Gibson is a great actor and I do feel that this was one of his stong movies but the sci-fi aliens that are supposed to enslave earth were not creepy wahatsoever and viewing this movie I didn't get one bit nervous. Though the mystery and the suspense was unique due to the build up of the aliens actually ariving.

1477476,4,B00005JL3T,"Back when Alfred Hitchcock was alive and making his first few films, I wonder if people really understood what a visionary filmmaker they had on their hands? I trust that only hindsight has brought an accurate assessment of the talent and skill posessed by the brillian filmmaker as well as the immense contribution he's made the the industry as a whole. M. Night Shyamalan is the only filmmaker in recent times that will be looked back upon from the future with a similar perspective.
Signs is the fifth movie by the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, though few people have ever heard (much less seen) his first two. Most people erroneously believe The Sixth Sense to be his first film, but I say they are partly right. With the Sixth Sense, Night was reborn as a film maker, not in terms of success but in his understanding of how to make films. It was as if the first two films were just learning experiences; practice runs. After all, who considers a director's student films when looking back at their work?
One of the amazing things about Night's work is his skillful use of symbolism and metaphor. It brings a very poetic feel to his storytelling lacking in just about every hollywood film out there. Even more amazing is his use of distractions and double meanings to tell you a story that you don't even realize your being told till the end. He's like a great stage magician; the wonderment is in what you don't see, even though it's right in front of your face.
The problem with Night is that he is too good at what he does (and perhaps typical audience member's brain is too atrophied due to the constant deluge of brainless hollywood ... thrown on the screen to understand). I see people condemning Signs for being a poor example of an alien invasion movie, or about alleged flaws in the aliens' design, behavior, motivations, etc.. Unfortunately people like this are why brainless, big-budget garbage like Independence Day (ID4) makes more money. Just because the movie poster has a picture of a crop circle with the word signs right above it does not mean that's what the movie is about; not with M. Night Shyamalan it doesn't.
Like The Sixth Sense, Signs points out early on what the film is about, yet people unbelievably fail to get it. Signs is no more about aliens than The Sixth Sense was about a kid who could ghosts or than Titanic is about a sinking ship. The main character is a priest who has lost his faith. The signs he is meant to see are not the ones in his corn crop, but like the audience, that is all he can see. Night masterfully keeps you focused on something else while he weaves his magic. The real signs are only finally understood when the characters understand them giving you a profound connection to them and the story. Award worthy performances seal the deal, making Signs a worthy addition to Night's three films.
If you've already seen the film, you really didn't need to read the preceeding words. But perhaps you are wondering whether or not to get the DVD. I was excited to hear that Signs (like Unbreakable) was being released directly as a Vista Series release. Vista Series releases are known for their slick deluxe packaging, extra discs, loads of extra features, and superb audio and video formats. If you've seen the Vista Series versions of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Tombstone, etc. then you understand what I am talking about. Signs has ""Vista Series"" stamped on the cover, but missing is just about everything you've come to expect. The DVD is one disc in a plain ole plastic case, and while it does have some nice extra features there are even less then the non-Vista Series release of The Sixth Sense. Basic extras that you've come to expect such as trailers, cast/crew bios, etc are non-existent. There is a nice little behind the scenes documentary. In it we hear about Night's insistance that the film be marketed in certain ways and small clips of the trailers are shown for examples. This only makes me want the trailers included on the disc even more. Leaving them off a premier edition disc is simply inexcusable. There are some deleted scenes, but they are still rough and unfinished and are devoid Night's standard commentary explaining why they were cut. Speaking of commentary, there isn't ANY at all anywhere even for the film itself. The disc only has one english audio format; Dolby 5.1. No choice for DTS or even 2-Channel Surround for those without decked out home theatre systems.
This DVD is not worthy of the Vista Series label. It is a direct deceit to those who have come to expect quality from the label. What's worse is that I smell executive gold digging attempting to extort more money from faithful fans with the release of a more deluxe version in the future. This would be the biggest sin. Executives have already got people to buy The Sixth Sense again by releasing the awesome Vista Series version. Now with Signs we get had again, or we get stuck with a shoddy, skimpy DVD release of a great film.",1042329600,5,4992,4.648190045248869

1477478,3,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is a sci-fi thriller which succeeds on a cinematic level because its director, M Night Shyamalan, is, like Hitchcock, Wilder, Scorsese, Spielberg and others, a master of the art of making movies. Every gifted filmmakers, past and present, does not produce a winner every time, and I suspect that ""Signs"" will be viewed in later years as one of Shayamalan's weaker entries. The problem is a script, which he wrote, that is intriguing but not completely thought out. There are too many obvious lapses in logic, and these prevent the viewer from becoming immersed in the story. [I can't go into much detail without ruining the movie for those who have not seen it.]
The story takes place in rural Pennsylvania, where Graham Hesse [Mel Gibson] lives on a farm with his two young children and his brother, Merrill [Joaquin Phoenix]. They reside in a lovely Victorian farmhouse surround by cornfields. [One lapse in logic I can note is that Hesse never once does any work in these fields; in fact, no farm implements are ever seen.] He is a clergyman who lost his faith when his wife was killed in an accident. His interest in God and spirituality is nil. One beautiful morning, the family awakens to discover a large crop circle in the cornfields. Soon these circles begin appearing all over the world, and it appears that they may be the work of aliens. Hesse must consider the impact this possibility may have on his family, all the while battling his own feelings about the Almighty.
""Signs"" almost succeeds in overcoming its script weaknesses because Shyamalan is so knowledgeable about film technique. At times the movie is genuinely frightening, often not because of what we see or hear but because of what we don't see or hear. The director knows how to let our imaginations run wild and how to keep us in suspense. And in a way, it doesn't matter that ""Signs"" isn't his strongest work because he's still good enough to make us look forward to his next movie. Some critics have been harshly dismissive towards ""Signs"", but I would remind them that the director is still very young. His movies will mature as he does.",1042329600,,2126,4.7331536388140165
1477479,3,B00005JL3T,"A clever, well directed but, ultimately, underwhelming suspense science fiction thriller Signs gets much right but just as much wrong. Clearly Night has tremendous talent as a director. While the characters are well drawn, the performances very good and the central idea interesting, the last act needed some work. Working solo as writer and director Night probably didn't get much input from another creative force. He could have used it with Signs.
The McGuffin is the threat of alien invasion. Really, it could have been set at any time during World War II with the Nazi's. It's just the catalyst to drive the plot forward. The alien invasion itself is pretty tame and not very well thought out. The motives for invasion unclear, the reasons they leave also a mystery.
The film is visually stunning and visually interesting using a lot of unconventional camera angles and stylistic choices to make the film interesting despite the flawed script. It's what Night doesn't show that frightens us more than seeing everything. It's a classic lesson that's been forgotten by most film directors. Night shows an understanding of suspense not seen since Spielberg's early days. He also avoids the cliches that Spielberg avoided early in his career and has only recently escaped from (for the most part).
The DVD is stunning looking with sharp images and beautiful color. The beautiful transfer and resolution is most noticable during the night sequences particularly when Gibson first sees the ""monster outside my window"". The extras are nice with an excerpt (like some of his previous DVD's) from the films Night made as a youth. The multi-angle storyboard option is also nice as well giving us an inside understanding of the film making process.
The only suggestion I would have made for improvement would have been to allow viewers to view the preview version vs. the final version. It would have, again, been interesting. Sometimes the preview version is superior to the final film (e.g., Jim Cameron's The Abyss). Overall, this is a fine DVD with a set up that doesn't quite have the eventual payoff it needs to succeed. It's still a riveting film for the first two-thirds of the film. Enjoy and keep your eye on Night as he's a major talent that's still finding his way.",1042243200,,2271,4.947643979057592
1477480,4,B00005JL3T,"I have been an M. Night fan ever since ""The Sixth Sense"".  The movies he creates remind me of The Twilight Zone, and his sense of plot twists and suspense is phenomenal.  Even his underappreciated ""Unbreakable"" was a mind-bending trip.  However, ""Signs"" was a little different.  Maybe there was too much buzz.  Maybe I set myself up for another great twist.  But, somehow ""Signs"" didn't exactly hit the mark.
Don't get me wrong.  Mel Gibson is poignant in his role as an ex-reverend who has lost his faith after losing his wife in a freak accident.  The mandatory creepy precocious children are present as always, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a surrogate parent role as Mel Gibson's younger brother.  As aliens begin to invade the planet, Gibson and his family realize that their farm has become an epicenter for these hostile visitors.
The whole movie flows well and keeps you guessing with every twist and turn.  However, the climactic ending leaves something to be desired.  It hits the mark, but not quite hard enough.  By the end, you realize that the whole movie is centered around the ideas of faith and fate.  Little facts presented throughout the movie play significant roles in the ending.  However, their significance doesn't quite ring as loudly as it should.  The movie turns into a cheezy sci-fi movie/morality tale.  I'm sure M. Night meant to reel us into the belief that things don't happen without a reason.  However, his way of relating this idea is a little convoluted and contrived.
However, I must admit that this is still a great chiller.  Shyamalan's directorial style is still captivating, and his ideas are still thought-provoking.  If he had just found a bigger, more dramatic way to get his point across, this could have been a real five-star movie.",1042243200,,1774,4.8533333333333335

I did like this movie, but it was much to serious.  The characters seemed to be enveloped in a cloud of sadness and depression all the time.  It's dificult to explain my reasons unless i detail why the constant sadness was present.
There were a few moments of levity in the movie, but even the levity was downplayed.
I loved the intense anticipation of ..""what's around the next corner..."".  But i still felt like Mel Gibson was holding back.  The Kids and Mel's *brother* were spectacular.

1477482,3,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is a brilliantly directed film, which I expect from Shyamalan in all cases (excluding ""Wide Awake"")  In this movie, he takes the end of the world as we know it, and shows this epic event through the eyes of a rural Washington family.  If you are expecting another ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" do not see this.  Although the premise of the movie is about aliens taking over the world, the creatures are only seen for a second or two at a time.  This movie is not about armageddon.  It's about how an average rural family interperets it.  If this were directed by Tim Burton, or someone like him, the aliens would hog the screen forr the entireity of the film, and explosions and screaming would be pumping through the speakers.  Shyamalan does the exact opposite.  He uses silence to scare his audience, whem there is nothing to be heard.  Silence is almost never this ominous.  His style is much like Alfred Hitchcock's, in that he only shows you little bits of action, if any at all.  Shyamalan's direction here is masterful.
The screenplay, on the other hand, is very flawed.  Often times, the movie relies on miracles and coincidences.  I will not describe any in detail, but the last epic scene seems to cinematic, which this movie is trying NOT to capture.  The last scene also is terrible.  The movie has no decent closure, but tried to.  Shyamalan should have either: a) Left the audience on a cliffhanger, or  b) Finish what he started.  In his other two thrillers, the endings have been the highlight of the entire movie...  This ending is dead, though.  I will not go on any more about lame things in the script.  I think you should decide for yourself.
In conclusion, if Shyamalan had a better script to work off of, he could have pulled of one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time.
While the script has it's flaws, I still encourage you to see ""Signs"" solely for the incredible direction.  Enjoy!",1042243200,,1932,4.620588235294117

1477559,5,B00005JL3T,"I watched this DVD last night prepared not to like it after reading some of the negative reviews -- boy was I wrong!
This is the story of a widower/farmer, sharing his life with two wonderful kids and a delightfully quirky brother.  He's a fairly miserable character at the start of this movie as he has recently lost his wife in a horrendous accident. He was a minister when his wife had her accident and through flashbacks we can see that he lost his faith and blames God for the loss of his wife and subsequently left his church.  The entire household is miserable because of the wife's loss and are made far more miserable by the anger they know he harbors.  OK so that's the subplot.
Into the story comes a bewildering crop circle. It is assumed that it was created by pranksters until the news reports that there are thousands of these circles that appeared all over the earth, in every country. The kids are terrified by the very real threat of alien invasion.  Meanwhile, their Dad tries to remain their rock solid support and deny the existence of any aliens.
Now that I laid the groundwork I don't want to go any further because it might just ruin the movie for you.  One hint is that there was a moment in the movie when my daughter and I literally screamed in surprise. Interspersed with tremendous suspense are a few well placed bits of comic relief that made us laugh out loud.

From the unsuccessful pretensions of the director to be the next Spielberg to Mel Gibson's over-the-top mugging (I wouldn't call it acting), this movie falls flat in almost every area. The story revolves around a thoroughly unconvincing crisis of faith in the lead character (Gibson), complete with cornball (no pun intended) flashbacks to his wife's death. This scene in particular displays the film's faults - improbable situation coupled with absurd dialogue, and Mel Gibson's utterly unbelievable portrayal of a distraught husband/man-of-the-cloth. And then - aliens invade earth! In what I kept hoping was a dream sequence that would turn the movie's ending into a Sixth Sense-style twist, the improbable and pointless presence of hostile aliens instead turns the film into a ridiculous B-grade sci-fi ""horror"" flick. The real horror comes from how poorly the whole thing is played out, and how all the acting seems forced and shallow.
  The story is a mish-mash of sci-fi and religious posturing with a cutesy Spielberg-like children/family focus.  I truly began to wonder if I was watching a made-for-tv movie on the PAX channel.

1477563,3,B00005JL3T,"Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has taken an interesting approach to the story of a worldwide alien invasion.  He keeps the focus tight on the experience of a single family that lives next to one of the fields where crop circles have been appearing.  We stay with this family and never learn anything that they don't know.  This makes for a very mysterious story.  No current filmmaker is better at creating an atmosphere of tension and dread than Shyamalan.
Unfortunately, there is an ongoing theme about faith and the connections between seemingly unconnected events that is not well integrated into the story; it struck me as being rather contrived.  Furthermore, the resolution is simply dreadful.  Suffice it to say that it is difficult to imagine any species evolving with the weakness that these aliens display at the end of the film.

I found the film very deep, intense, and thought-provoking at times.  The film offered an incredible point of view that's rarely explored in modern cinema.  The directing of the film was great.  By how the film was directed, you could tell it's definiately by Shyamalan.  The acting was very impressive.  The only major problem I had with the movie was the ending.  Without spoiling the movie, I had expected for the ending to be far more cunning and shocking than it was and it failed to give a tasty, surprising twist like his previous two movies did.  I did find the film a little bit slow at times but that's minor.  Overall, it was an enjoyable and good flick.

1477565,2,B00005JL3T,"Okay, I loved ""Sixth Sense"", I was totally non-commital on ""Unbreakable"", and I really thought that ""Signs"" was completely pointless. What has become of M. Night Shyamalan's promise of talent?
""Signs"" is a major let-down for so many reasons. First, its script gives us characters so caught in emotional inertia that it  results in the audience completely lacking empathy for them.
Second (also a script issue) -- nothing really happens! For a film in which the world is invaded by aliens, so much of the action occurs as descriptions overheard on the news, with the actors reacting with such ""oh well..."" responses that we never have any feel for the gravity of the situation. As a result, none of the scare elements really work. Where is the hysteria?
MAJOR SOILER WARNING: One of the worst elements of the film is the resolution and the classic M. Night ""reveal"". The idea that these aliens are harmed by water and choose to invade a planet that is, well, mostly water is just so illogical. Couldn't these interplanetary geniuses at least build a waterproof suit? C'mon! What, are we back in 50's B-movie territory? And the concept that ""everything happens for a reason"" is so slight an idea but given such heavy emphasis in the conclusion. It almost seems as if it was conceived after the fact of writing the final scenes so as to lend some sort of philosphical weight to the image of Joaquin Phoenix with a baseball bat, beating the bejeesus out of an alien! --- END SPOILERS
As for the performances, well, given what they had to work with, they are merely ok. Mel Gibson looks so weary throughout the film as to make you want to pull him off the set and put him to bed for a while (am I the only person that thinks that, for a man in his mid 40's, Gibson just looks [bad]?).
What's good about this film? Well, it looks pretty nice. Good photography and nice, believable sets. I also kinda liked the idea that we never really get a good look at the alien. A little refreshing in these days of ""show it all""
Otherwise, we have a slow moving, rather pointless film with a slight script trying too hard to be important. I would loved to have seen a film where the characters are forced to watch the invasion from afar, showing their real terror and dispair at what they know is approaching -- but without all the spiritual clap-trap. This could have been a rural, extraterrestrial ""Failsafe"".
But hey, at least we got me to move beyond the non-commital feeling of ""Unbreakable"" -- but ya sent me the wrong way, Night!",1042156800,,2518,4.570796460176991

1. This is not a sci-fi thirller.
2. This is not necessarily a movie about alien invasion.
3. This is not your typical Hollywood movie at all.
I think the reason 'Signs' has garnered all the negative press it has is due to the silly preconceptions of most viewers and their annoying habit of comparing any given movie to a million others.
As a matter of fact, that's one thing that makes ""Signs"" so appealing: you can't compare it to anything else. You cannot compare any of Night's movies to any others, so the exercise is not only useless, it makes most of the reviews here pointless. Unless of course you were hoping for a dramatic ""Independence Day,"" or perhaps a less campy ""V."" If that's the case, move on.
If you allow the movie to be judged based solely on its own merit, any open-minded audience would realize it is unique, ambitious, and almost completely free of anything from the Hollywood director's bag of tricks. God forbid a film maker pay such acute attention to character, setting and screenplay.
The bottom line is really this: if you are familiar with Night's other films (and that includes watching the DVD documentaries on each of the previous movies, which, by the way, are incredibly refreshing in their detail) and enjoy his very fresh style, you will like ""Signs."" It's not a strong or as fully rounded as the other two, but his use of framing, color and subtle emotion is as sharp as ever and will be sure to satisfy.
If you don't know Night's other moveis, watch them first. You probably won't like ""Signs.""

1477666,3,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shaymalan is a director who seems less interested in coherent plot and logic of storyline than he is in strings of details:  interesting and sometimes bizarre events that, when looked at from a different point of view, tell a very different story than the one you think you've been seeing.  When this works, as in _The Sixth Sense_, it is incredibly moving and disturbing, and makes you question your own closely held notions of reality.  When it doesn't work, as in _Signs_, it comes across as pretentious and self-aggrandizing, a way of saying, ""Hey look at me, ain't I profound.""
In _Signs_, Mel Gibson plays a former priest (Anglican, I'm assuming, tho' this was never made clear) who has lost his faith and left the church six months before on the sudden death of his wife. AS the movie opens, he and his family discover a giant crop circle in their cornfield.  Soon enough they discover that similar circles have sprung up overnight all over the world and that they are the markers for an alien invasion fleet. With aliens landing very near all the crop circles, it becomes up to Mel to save his family.
There are actually a lot of good things about _Signs_.  All the performances are quite good, played with just enough realism. The style of the film is appropriate to the subject, with lots of spooky long shots and odd camera angles. The significant details do add up in a significant way, which in itself is hard to do.  And the storyline, though not incredibly original, is one of those that has become a kind of modern mythology, and is treated as such.
However, I had numerous problems with this film.  The first and most overwhelming is that the ending is so incredibly obvious, given Mel Gibson's character.  I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as I knew he'd been a priest.  So the movie becomes more about a man's crisis of faith and the alien invasion seems a really dijointed vehicle to get the point across.  The theme and the plot didn't go together in my eye.  I kept asking myself, ""Why did it have to be aliens?"" and I couldn't come up with a good answer.
Lots of details are missing from the story, and as they added up, it really began to bother me.  Things like, how did a full time Anglican Priest have time to also be a full time corn farmer? And why didn't he ever seem to be farming? And, given the aliens' fatal weakness, how did they stand to be in rural Pennsylvania at that time of year in the first place?  And, why do aliens in this kind of movie never have any clothes or weapons?  And, what happened to the single adult female character, who you thought was going to be major and then just disappeared?  All in all, the movie was a lacework of what Shaymalan wanted you to see, but afterward I realised there were just to many holes to satisfy me.
I'm still waiting for that great follow up to _The Sixth Sense_.  I'd like to see that it wasn't just a fluke.  Unfortunately, _Signs_ makes me think that maybe it was.",1042156800,6,2976,4.4411764705882355

Here are some things to make you go ""Hmmmm"":
1. If the alien was so fast that he could jump off the roof and into the cornfield faster than a minor league baseball player, then how come it just stood there and got beat to death with a baseball bat at the end (I didn't give anything away here, I just saved two hours of your life).
2. Do alien invasions really take place in less than 24 hours?
3. When the aliens DO take out the TV stations, you'll get static, not a test signal.  And the stations probably won't be back on the air the next day either.
4. Am I missing the point of this movie?  I don't think so.  The point was abundantly clear in the first 15 minutes.  The preacher lost his faith when his wife was killed in a car wreck and got it back when his son didn't die at the end (again, I just saved you).  This might have made an OK movie if only they had some real writers write the script, real cinematographers film it, and a real director direct it.  Unfortunately, this real movie watcher watched it and I want those two hours of my life back!",1042156800,15,1065,4.07177033492823
1477668,2,B00005JL3T,"I loved ""The Sixth Sense"", but was very dissapointed by ""Unbreakable"".  I was eager to see if the director was lucky with the first or just off target with the second.  This film is more about a crisis of faith that the Mel Gibson character is having than it is about aliens or crop circles.  The tension brought about by the happenings of the film forces the former preacher to come to terms with his beliefs about God, and destiny among other things.
Overall, the first half of the film was brilliant.  The thought of what might be and what could happen is almost always more frightful than anything else.  I know hearts were racing as we followed through the dark corn fields, hearing unknown creatures rustling among the stalks or as we peered under the pantry door to see what was locked in.  The unknown and unseen in the film becomes almost laughable when it is revealed.
The second portion of the film was not good at all.  In order to enjoy it, you have to do like the writer/director did when it was made and turn a blind eye to plot holes and things that just didn't make any sense.  It might seem odd to say that a story about crop circles and aliens is flawed since it is clearly fiction.  But in the ""Sixth Sense"" it was much easier to forget reality and become entangled with an equally outlandish concept that a boy can see and talk to dead people.  The attention to detail found in ""The Sixth Sense"" was absent in second half of ""signs"".  It is where the movie seemed to fall apart and gaping plot holes and conceptual flaws were revealed.
The movie ends in an attempt to leave you with warm fuzzies as the crisis of faith is resolved and more or less everyone happy as a result.  If you can ignore ludicris contradictions and just have fun watching a movie, go for it and have fun.  Otherwise, you will be too busy making a list of mistakes to enjoy the movie.",1042156800,,1878,4.346704871060172
1477669,3,B00005JL3T,"In the latest movie from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense & Unbreakable), former man of the cloth Graham Hess discovers an elaborate 500 foot crop circle in his field of corn. As more of these circles appear across the planet, opinion in his family (two young children and a younger brother) is divided as to whether these circles are part of an elaborate hoax or signs of an alien invasion. As the story unfolds, so does a voyage of self-discovery in this slow-build movie.
Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a lapsed Episcopalian minister, who locals still unselfconsciously address as ""Father"", despite the fact he abandoned his faith following the death of his wife in a horrific car accident six months earlier. He lives on a picturesque farm in idyllic Bucks County outside Philadelphia with his two young children and his somewhat delinquent, former minor league baseball star, younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix), who has apparently moved in to provide a shoulder for his grieving older brother to cry on. In trademark Shyamalan style the children, played by Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, have a major part to play in the telling of this story. Younger sister Bo is the wide-eyed innocent of the two, whereas older brother Morgan is the preternaturally wise child with an instinctive spiritual connection to matters not of this world.
Signs, is a very worthy movie about faith and the meaning of life. Ultimately, the message is that everything, no matter how unpleasant, happens for a reason. We are all part of a bigger plan, nothing occurs by chance and that as long as we remember to read the signs (on our journey through life) and do not lose faith, everything will work out okay in the end. As such it is an uplifting story but if the old adage that a good story lies in its telling still holds true, then it must be pointed out that Signs has some serious flaws.
While it becomes clear at the end of the movie that the aliens in this movie are merely a device through which to deliver the, everything happens for a reason, do not lose faith message, it has to be said that there appearance counts for many of the flaws and plot holes in the movie. For example, surely if a race had the technology to travel millions of miles through space, they might have the technology to have developed some sort of protective armour, or even a wet suit, and have some half-decent weapons to use against mankind? Surely also the locals might have contemplated kitting themselves out with some shotguns, if not a spare AK 47 or two? I mean, what farmer doesn't at least own a shotgun? Yet this movie is devoid of any weapons at all, with the exception of a kitchen knife and a baseball bat. It is also unclear as to whether or not our Mel was a farmer (as well as a clergyman) before his wife was killed because he certainly doesn't appear to do much work.

On the plus side, however, Signs is an amiable and thought provoking enough movie. The suspense is built up with some skill, although a little slowly for my liking, with some good edge of the seat tension and the odd genuine scare.  Signs is also genuinely and deliberately amusing at times, with assured direction from it's very talented young director, who has obviously learnt a lot from watching the likes of Spielberg and Hitchcock. Shyamalan also proves once again what a great director of actors he is, as all the acting is both subtle and faultless, with the only exception being from Shyamalan, who totally mis-cast himself as Ray Reddy, the local vet responsible for the death of Gibson's wife.
Signs is an enjoyable enough if somewhat uneven yarn but it's certainly not the great movie that some people would have you believe. It's possibly the weakest of M.Night Shyamalan's last three outings and it will take a large suspension of disbelief not to conclude at the end of the movie that those aliens sure were rubbish.",1042156800,,3901,4.676855895196507

This directors claim to fame was the Sixth Sense which was a 2 hour borefest. The only thing which made that movie worthwhile was the surprise ending  but, the problem was that I and many other viewers thought the movie was a dull waste of time up to that point. This movie has a similar dull slow paced tone since  most scenes  take  place inside the house and like the 6th sense, the movie focuses on the main characters psychology where in this case it shows us Mel Gibsons personal struggles caused by his past. We don't see much of the Aliens until the end which is fine if there was supspense however, Signs lacks that quality with the exception of the ending. As a result, this made the movie dull and dreary and as was the case with the Sixth Sense, there was a surprise ending which didn't do much to salvage this film.",1042070400,,1031,4.354166666666667
1477673,1,B00005JL3T,"This is not anything you may want to spend time watching. It's a dog, but a dead mutt and it stinks.
Mel Gibson gives as much as he possibly can with a [bad] script. It's not his fault. He is an expert professional actor and does his best. To his credit, he plays it seriously. Good for Mel!
The story could have been successful, except M. Night Shyamalan decided to keep things dark. He probably wanted to make a claustrophobic thriller. All the tricks of the trade, designed to shake audiences were left out, except the ringing of a phone, especially amplified to awake the viewers. Oh, and turning off the lights at the proper moment. (All toddlers go into panic at that point, but then they do it because they can't see the bowl of popcorn and are afraid they won't be able to eat it.)
""Signs"" is really a shocker in reverse. Apparently there has been an alien invasion of earth. How do we know this? Well, they show us some lights on a TV screen, in a newscast from Mexico. What made ""Independence Day"" famous (special effects and moving action), doesn't exist here. ""Signs"" lacks everything.
It gets worse. They have this alien, an emaciated and anorexic fellow dressed in green. Aw, pleeeze! Gimme a break! My 6-year-old neighbor does it better for Halloween. No matter. They show a scene that ""contains disturbing material"" on that TV screen within the movie. This time from Brazil. A group of terrified children, running from one window to another, screaming in fear. (If they are so scared, why do they ask for more instead of going to Mom's lap? Are we supposed to be terrified by terrified children? Yes, we are. Sorry, it's true.) And then... yes, the skinny green fellow appears an disappears and the viewer says: ""What was THAT?""
The scene by the way, is ludicrous to the extreme and the actor who's supposed to see it (he watches TV inside a closet, don't ask me why: I fell asleep before they show why he does such a silly thing), well, the actor is instructed to be horrified. By a skinny green alien? Yes, by a skinny green alien. Is he really, really horrified? Yes, he is, but we think nobody else on the whole wide planet would have been.
The skinny green alien was played by a skinny, anorexic-looking, emaciated actress walking against a blue back drop (one of the thrilling special effects that director Shyamalan explains in a documental included in this DVD). And, don't be surprised, everybody sucks up to Shyamalan in this documental. Call it job security.
Oh, why, why does an apparently talented director indulge in such a dog? And he WROTE the damned disgraceful thing.
Shall I say more? Is there room left?
Yes, there's room left. Let's go to the special futures. Director Shyamalan treats us to one minute of his first movie. He was young and inexperienced. Yes. He warns us that it's bad, really bad. Okay. Don't show it then, because your fans are gonna drop like flies. But no, he shows it. It's a ""horror"" scene so bad, that my 4-year-old neighbor could have done it better. And, yes, many fans actually drop like flies, including me.
All in all, did M. Night Shyamalan really direct this dog? Maybe he didn't. Maybe it was directed by the green, skinny, emaciated alien. Who knows? I will not watch any more of whatever Shyamalan does in the future. ""The Sixth Sense"" was outstanding. ""Unbreakable"" was hu-hum. ""Sings"" was... aw, quit it!
Does this dog have redeaming futures? Yeah. Do we care? Nope.",1042070400,4,3439,4.620915032679738
1477763,2,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" was a dull, silly mishmash of a movie.  It tried to be a scary thriller with thematic content, but failed on both counts.  It also ripped-off ""Independence Day"", ""Panic Room"", and ""Night of the Living Dead"".
""Signs"" opens in aptly named Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Mel Gibsons character, Graham Hess  an ex-preacher who lost his faith when his wife died  has become a farmer.  Since family farms are notoriously unprofitable, and Bucks County real-estate notoriously expensive, I cant imagine how Hess survives  particularly since we never see him so much as turn over a shovelful of earth.  Is it one of those farms where they're paid *not* to grow anything?  Are there hemp plants hidden among the cornstalks?
One morning, Hess notices that his fields have acquired crop circles overnight.  Are they the work of rowdy teens, or is Something Out There?  We already know the answer from the scary, tingly music at the beginning; but we have to sit through much aimless meandering before the movie lets us in on the ""secret"".
Hess and his family cower in their house, passively waiting for the aliens to show up.  Meanwhile, they pass the time with sappy stories (""When you were born"")  instead of stockpiling food, water, firewood, weapons (theyre rural guys with pickup trucks, so surely they must have gun collections)  like anyone with half a brain would.
*Spoiler warning*.
Spaceships arrive, and everyone obsessively monitors their progress on TV.  One alien is caught on videotape, crashing a backyard birthday party.  The networks broadcast the tape, and the alien is finally shown  walking like ""Bigfoot"", and looking like the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the 1950s movies.  After all that suspense  the aliens are *little green men*?  How does a movie this creatively bankrupt even get made?
Panic ensues in the outside world  we assume.  All we actually *see* is Hess family barricaded in their basement (unnecessarily, since the aliens, despite their mastery of intergalactic travel, apparently cant work a simple door).
The next day, the radio announces that the aliens are gone, as abruptly and arbitrarily as they arrived.  The only explanation offered for this is that some guys in the Middle East defeated a few of them by ""primitive methods undisclosed at this time"" (??), and the rest instantly fled.
Except for one left behind  who, furthermore, bears a grudge against Hess.  The lone remaining alien is quickly and effortlessly dispatched using water (no, he doesnt squeal, ""Help me, Im melting!"", which at least would have been *intentionally* funny) and a baseball bat.  Where/how did the guys who routed the other aliens find water and/or baseball bats in the middle of the desert?
Hess & Co. are saved.  Hess decides that, since he won this round, there IS a divine plan after all.  Hess and God kiss and make up; and the conclusion is that mysticism is not only morally superior to rationality, but also works better from a practical standpoint  or that since aliens are real, so are all other supernatural beings  or that if you believe in God/Allah/Vishnu, He/She/It will save your bacon when the going gets tough.
This simpleminded ""God and baseball"" theme is exacerbated by cardboard characterization.  Mel Gibson plays the same sort of rah-rah reactionary doofus hes already played in half a dozen movies.  To be absolutely sure that everybody ""gets"" his virtuousness, the movie makes him a preacher AND a farmer; the only way they could have made him more saintly is to give him a volunteer job working with handicapped puppies.  Mel gets to use only one of his two facial expressions  the furrowed brow of manly resolve  the roguish twinkle is absent, probably because the only non-dead woman in the movie is a police officer.
Hess is established as a namby-pamby from the beginning  he cant force himself to swear, not even to keep his house from being broken into.  He was even a priss throughout the supposedly cathartic binge-eating scene  Bruce Willis would have shoveled those mashed potatoes in with both hands.
Supporting cast members Cherry Jones and Rory Culkin were fine.  As for Joaquin Phoenix  why is he even *in* ""Signs""?  He had absolutely nothing to do except baby-sit  and even that was unnecessary, since Mel was always home.  What did they need Phoenix for?  They could easily have made Mel a ballplayer  or not, since you don't have to be Mark McGuire to brain somebody with a bat.
The daughter was one of the most gratingly cutesie-poo kiddie characters Ive ever seen; her phobic neurosis made her even more repellent.  After the second time she pushed away her water glass, I was itching to empty it over her, methodically soaking every inch of her face, hair, and clothing.
The religious content was simultaneously preachy and pointless.  I couldn't care less whether a fictitious character believes in another, equally fictitious, character  so restoring Hess ""faith"" was no more commendable than restoring his belief in Santa Claus.
Shyamalans depiction of religion as a wishing well was morally repugnant.  Hess beliefs fluctuate according to whether or not hes getting his way at a given moment:  ""My wife died!  Boy, am I mad at God! The aliens went away, so now I like God again (even though he was presumably the one who let them invade earth in the first place)My shoelace broke; looks like thats it for God."", etc.  Incidentally, a supernatural being so devoid of ethics and integrity that he resorts to endangering children to frighten his followers into submission is a bully at best, if not outright psychotic.  Is this supposed to be God  or the Boogeyman?
""Signs"" is neither a well-thought-out parable about religion, nor entertaining trash.  Its a two-hour-long ""Like a Rock"" truck commercial with aliens and proselytizing.  Asinine screenplay, plodding pace, holey (not holy) logic, self-indulgent direction (that *subtle* cameo?!)  this full-of-itself mess wouldnt have made a good ""X-Files"" episode, let alone movie.

Unfortunately in this very very slow movie his story gets overshadowed with the very usual and trite ""creatures from outer space"" look.  One keeps wondering why these fears of extraterrestrial invasion are treated like all the other Hollywood horror movies with very similar storylines - that though these visitors are of superior intelligence they seem totally incapable of overcoming even the most absurd attempts at keeping them away from their 'goals'.

So, despite the promotion of this movie as a science-fiction ""alien"" movie, and despite the fact that I don't generally like Mel Gibson movies, I decided to give it a try.  I couldn't get my husband to go...he was really turned off by the crop circle mumbo-jumbo.  Several other people I know felt the same.

So it was a pleasant surprise when it turned out that the alien/crop circle stuff is really just a plot device that helps tell a great story about a man who loses his faith (or at least professes that he has) when his wife dies.  His loss of faith is put to the test under the extreme stress of an alien invasion.  I won't spoil the story by revealing more, but must add that Signs is not in any sense a formulaic sci-fi movie and if you go expecting that you will be very disappointed.

Signs is so intense, so thought-provoking and so uplifting that I have been touting it to all my friends and family for months.

This was one of the few movies that was playing and remembering great reviews I had heard about it, we went in to see it. I remember sitting in my seat, petrified at times, and laughing at others. What makes this movie great, is the fact that it plays with your mind, leaving extremely tense edge-of-your-seat suspense. Earlier on in the film, you see some shadowy, grainy looking pictures of these aliens, but they really appear too fast to know what to make of them. You keep wondering, ""Are these guys friendly? What do they look like?"" This is the recipe that keeps this movie alive. I remember walking out of the theatre with my friends and just being blown away by everything.

I like watching movies for two reasons.  One is to be entertained.  The other is to look at the movie as an art form and trying to figure out what a movie is trying to say.  In the movie Signs you have a well designed message that combines beliefs in UFO's and the belief that good things can come about from bad events because their is a God who can redeem any situation.  Many people look at those who beleive in UFO's and have faith as being irrational based upon how their percieve their reality.  One of the things this movie is doing is trying to challenge us to think about our perception of reality.

For every Peter Jackson, there are three George Lucas's.  Fortunately, we have M. Night Shyamalan, who in ""Signs"" recognized that the unknown shadow is infinitely scarier than the most elaborate CGI monster.  Like Spielburg in ""Jaws"", for most of the movie, Shyamalan only hints at the menace that drives the tension.  When you combine such an insightful director with a brilliant, thoughtful script, you have a recipe for a wonderful movie, and ""Signs"" doesn't disappoint.
As one might guess, ""Signs"" takes as its jumping off point the appearance of a crop circle in the cornfield of a rural Pennsylvania man.  Graham's not just any man though, he's the father of two (Morgan and Bo), a recent widower, and clergyman who has left the cloth in his grief.  His brother (Merrill) forms the final element in the primary cast of characters.  As UFO's appear in the skies and the world waits for the other shoe to drop, the viewer sees the drama unfold through the eyes of his family.  Rather than resorting to elaborate special effects laden, set piece scenes, Shyamalan uses the relatively simple vehicle of TV news and grainy camcorder footage to set the scene.
It is difficult to describe much more without giving away key plot elements, but I can say that Shyamalan does an excellent job of ratcheting up the tension.  In particular, he makes excellent use of shadows and relatively simple sound effects (scratching, breaking glass, footsteps, etc).  Also, the score is utilized in a highly effective manner; in some ways it reminded me of ""The Exorcist"" which had very little music except for key moments.  While there is somewhat more background in this film, it is used to much the same effect.
As entertaining and genuinely suspenseful a movie as this is, there is also a lot more to ""Signs"".  It is deeply moving and grapples with some truly profound issues.  I suspect that there are very few people who have ever been married, or even loved someone completely, who can watch Mel Gibson's scenes with his dying wife and not shed a tear.  At the same time, Shyamalan struggles with issues of faith that are all the more profound in this post 9/11 world (shooting began on 9/12).  Do things, even bad things, even awful things, happen for a reason?  Is there a something greater at work here, or are we all just spinning around the sun in a cold, indifferent universe?  At several points during the movie, Graham and Merrill share conversations that are among the most thoughtful I have ever encountered in any film.
Finally, lest the reader think this film is stifling in its suspense and seriousness, I would like to add that this is a genuinely funny movie.  Merrill and Bo in particular add numerous light moments, many of which had me laughing out loud.  This humor is key in keeping the movie from bogging down, and is an element that was sorely lacking in Shyamalan's other films.
Ultimately, this is a heartfelt, entertaining film of the highest caliber.  It is suspenseful and scary in the finest tradition of Hollywood, and its limited use of special effects offers a sense of realism, of emotional depth, that is noticeably absent from most movies today.  If you've ever struggled with issues of faith, if you enjoy scary, suspenseful movies, or both, ""Signs"" is definitely a film worth checking out.
Enjoy!",1041897600,2,3476,4.798657718120805

As far as a movie about a man refinding his faith and family, its cliched but bearable.
As any kind of sci-fi/horror film it is an absolute failure.  There are soooo many holes in this film that it can't even begin to make any sense.  There are moments that are funny and true, and others that just lull you to sleep.  M Night has a real tendancy to beat his audience over the head with something just to make sure we got it.

All in all, there are a handfull of good scenes surrounded by scenes where M Night is trying to show us all how great he is at creating suspense.  Sadly, he is not so great at it afterall.
The more movies M Night makes just further proves his ineptness at making a good movie.  He is more about showing the world how smart he is than making an entertaining and smart film.

1478002,3,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is, as a story, a bit lacking.  To a large degree, it was a bit too formulaic (it was like actually watching a movie about drawing a basic plot line), and to an extent things just didn't feel like they were clinging together very tightly.  Then again... that was kind of the point.
While the ending was an embarassing example of how stupid Hollywood can be sometimes, the movie in general was just a projection of the characters it was portraying, particularly Mel Gibson.  He wasn't all together, nor was his family, and in the disarray of it all, there was a sort of suspense he was made to endure along with the audience.  Having lost his faith, there was no telling what was coming next, and considering his having been former clergy that was a pretty daunting step.  Over all, the humanity of the characters, and the brilliant acting used to portray that, is what makes this movie worth watching.
The random shifts in the story line don't mean much, as the characters run into more and more ""unexpected"" things, you are bound to be unaffected by the story... but the actors will keep you there, and they will make this movie one that will hold you until the very end.  Such is what M. Night seems to be best at: getting actors we know are good to transcend any and all expectations.
So, while I really just didn't like the ending, I feel it necessary to give this movie three stars because everything is just so well done.  And, in response to people who argued that one problem w/ the movie was how it never informed the audience as to why the aliens were attacking, it made sense because the most frightening part of the invasions was how impersonal and irrational it wound up being, thus leaving most - if not all - of the ""earthlings"" without a clue as to anything except that the invasion was happening.",1041897600,,1821,4.483383685800605

M Night Shyamalan is one of the most talented filmmakers working today...Taking his cue from Alfred Hitchcock, the suspense is built not by gore and what we see, but rather what we DON'T see is what keeps us on the edge of our seat...(What's on the other side of that door???!!

  This film has a lot of well placed humor that doesn't detract from the storyline and adds a lot to the characters (the scene with the foil hats is sure to be remembered for years to come...). And after a particular jump scene in the middle, where a lot of people tend to scream, Shyamalan spaces out the dialogue, 'cause he knows people are going to scream, and then laugh nervously at their own reaction (in other words, there's a pause in the dialogue after a jump scene, so you don't miss anything...).
  This movie was very well written, with lots of little things throughout the movie leading up to the climax, and adding to the theme of the movie (Is someone watching out for us?)...Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie...it's a fun movie to watch with a group of friends (preferably those who are apt to scream...).

The ""news"" footage of the invasion is interesting and the cinematic work is memorable in the beginning. The second is about a priest [Mel Gibson] and his loss of faith when, God, presumably, allows his wife to be killed in a freak auto accident. During the course of the film, it becomes obvious that the director couldn't decide which story he liked best. Ultimately, the extraterrestrials are relegated to a prop supporting the priests' regained faith as they are quickly dispatched with tap water and a Louisville Slugger [baseball bat]; a metaphor uttered by his wife before dying on the hood of a Suburban.

1478086,2,B00005JL3T,"It's a shame.  This was a movie that falls way short of its potential.  It's like the producers decided that, once Mel Gibson signed on for the project, they didn't need to bother with anything else, like a script that made any sense.  And to a point they were right.  Mel Gibson's acting was fantastic, as was that of the supporting cast, and for a little while at least you can enjoy the movie on that superficial level.  And if the alien element were removed and the film concentrated on character development, it might have worked.  The story arc about a reverend who loses and then regains his faith could have supported this film on its own, but for some reason they decided to throw a supernatural twist into the mix and introduce us to the dumbest aliens ever.  Forget the fact that these aliens traveled billions of miles to randomly kill people for no reason.  Forget the fact that these aliens who are smart enough to develop intergalactic travel aren't smart enough to develop a way to break a door down.  Forget the fact that these aliens can navigate their way safely across the galaxy, but can't find Mexico City without ruining some poor farmer's crops.  The most assinine thing is that these aliens are so stupid that, even though water is poisonous to them, they try to invade a world that is mostly made of water.  Duh.
If you are a Mel Gibson fan, pick this film up.  He doesn't let the foolishness of the script interfere with his acting.  If you are looking for a story, however, look elsewhere.

I was, for the general part, right..
But, regardless, when I saw this, I thought this movie was actually very good. The scenes were well thought out. And just the anticipation and suspense of the film made me want to watch it, to see what would happen. Many parts of movie were actually creepy. One part that stood out (for me) was when the one guy threw rocks into the crop field.

1478088,5,B00005JL3T,"Signs is a wonderful little story about faith and family, but like The Sixth Sense, it is also a terrifying thriller It's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies I think that's one of the reasons I like M. Night Shyamalan's so much. He so perfectly crafts his film to pull you into the story, make you care about the characters and keep you at the edge of your seat. He not only builds suspense, but knows how far to push before letting off with some sort of comic relief in order to maintain a very high level of interest and suspense. A stark contrast to this is Panic Room in which David Fincher does a great job of creating suspense, but pushes so hard on the suspense that there isn't any possibility to sustain that through the film. You get so tired of being so suspended for so long that ultimately the effect wears off.
Mel Gibson is at the top of that list, with an excellent performance as a man who loses faith but continues to fight to hold his family together despite his many emotional ups and downs.

Another flaw of the film is, if these aliens are intelligent enough to make intrikit crop patterns and somehow fly their way through space and find earth, how come they can't find their way out of a laundry room bolted shut by a wooden chair?  And the whole scene where the son is dying from asthma used as a suspense tactic did not belong in this movie.  We want to see the aliens!!!

1478190,1,B00005JL3T,"Whereas M. Night Shyamalan's previous two major films The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000) used implausible ideas to try and entertain, Signs (2002) uses far-fetched ideas in an attempt to make a profound statement. The attempt fails, and the film is neither entertaining nor profound. Warning: This review, like most of the ones here, contains spoilers. So, if you haven't seen it then probably skip my review.
The first major idea presented is that crop circles are of extraterrestrial origin. The true, hoax origin of crop circles is acknowledged in the film, and then quickly brushed aside by the fact that in a mere 72 hour period, 18 crop circles were made in India. Surely that is beyond the possibility of human behavior! Just do the math! In the film it says it would take a 2-3 person team 1 night to make a typical group of ""circles"" in a field. So over 3 nights, that would require 6 2-3 person teams, or a total of 12-18 people in on the hoax. This, in India, which has a population of over 1 billion people. Also, we are told that the crop circles are being used as ""markers"" for the extraterrestrials to use when their invasion begins. This, from extraterrestrials who are obviously very technologically advanced, being able to travel at very high speeds through space, and to remember where they want to go on Earth they're still relying on forming patterns in crops which will only be visible about half of each day.
Next we are told that the extraterrestrials are probably here to take over the world in order to exploit its natural resources, having depleted their planet's natural resources. This is believable enough, as if the film was set 200 years in the future, I can easily see it being turned the other way around, with humans as the invaders of the extraterrestrial world. But it's all for not as the extraterrestrials traveled across the galaxy and forgot to bring any serious weapons, as the only threat they present to us is their ability to emit a small amount of poison out of their wrists. So the extraterrestrials, without having made any real attempt to take over Earth, go back home just as quickly as they came.
This film does raise some interesting points and questions, though.
When space ships are seen hovering over Mexico City, the comment is made, first by the young son, then by the TV newscaster, that ""Everything people have written about in science books is going to change."" This is a rather profound statement, but it is probably false. While information from an advanced civilization might give a few insights and refinements that would have taken us a few more decades to find out, the bulk of chemistry, physics, geology, and even cosmology and astronomy would be unaffected. Biology would probably be the most heavily affected science, as studying intelligent extraterrestrial biological organisms that evolved completely independently of life on Earth could provide great insights on common principles of Evolution throughout the universe.
Also, while much attention is given to human beings and religion, the subject of religion is ignored in relation to the extraterrestrials, which is another source for many questions. Were the extraterrestrials theists? While they were above the major cities in their cloaked space ships, were they praying to their God(s) for success in their invasion in order to claim what's left of Earth's natural resources? Or, if the extraterrestrial invasion had nothing to do with our natural resources, then was it a cosmic proselytizing mission, in which the extraterrestrials, with empirical evidence for their God(s), were simply trying to share this evidence with us so we can stop worshiping our false Gods and start worshiping their true God(s)?
And perhaps most importantly, was ""swing away"" good advice, let alone so good to think it was of divine origin? That is, is there any good evidence to suggest that a God would have a man fall asleep at the wheel and kill an innocent woman so that she could utter the last words ""swing away,"" which would be interpreted by her husband Graham (Gibson), 6 months later, that this meant Merrill (Phoenix) should beat an extraterrestrial in their living room to death with a baseball bat? I don't think so. Merrill owned 5 records in minor league baseball, one of which was the record for the most strikeouts. He probably would have made it to the major leagues if he didn't recklessly ""swing away"" as he did. It is not plausible that without those last words Graham and Merrill would have been unable to defend their family. Indeed, it is amazing Merrill didn't grab the baseball bat much earlier in the film. An ideal time for Merrill to ""swing away"" would have been when the family was in the basement by having Graham open the door suddenly and shine the light in the extraterrestrial's eyes while Merrill swung away at the extraterrestrial's head with the pickaxe.
In the end, the film isn't really about crop circles or extraterrestrials but rather about using coincidences as the basis for belief in God. This makes the entire plot with extraterrestrials not only superfluous, but also detrimental. If Shyamalan's goal was to make a film about using coincidences to establish faith in God, then resorting to saying that a hodge-podge of hoaxes and unlikely ideas are also real diminishes this goal. Instead of using extraterrestrials to give ""swing away"" divine significance, it would be better to have a human burglar or a disgruntled parishioner break into the Hess home, at which point Graham tells Merrill to ""swing away"" with a bat to protect the family. This would still be weak and desperate, but it would be better than the scenario presented. As is, Signs provides nothing but silly, even if fanciful, ideas and scenarios about crop circles, extraterrestrials, and God.",1041552000,16,5828,4.905775075987842

While you're at it, disable your brain's logical unit. NOW you have War of the Worlds.
H. G. Wells' classic novel is ruined in this unadmitted adaptation, which does a great job at tricking the viewer with a promising trailer, but instead subjecting one to a story that doesn't really tie together (aliens are deathly afraid of water, yet don't mind romping around in the cornfields, which god knows are damp with dew).

It was excellently written, and told from a point of view no other ""sci-fi"" movie has doen before, that of a single family experiancing the event as it was happening. It doesnt even have a clear genra either. It was part sci-fi, part thriller, part suspence all rolled into one. It was especially personal in the scene with Joaquin Phoenix sitting watching the TV waiting for something to happen. After 9/11 we all know what that feels like. This movie was down-right incredible, and anyone who didn't like it is simply retarded. Nuff said. Go out and buy this movie, it will be the best $20 you spend.",1041465600,,675,4.451612903225806

messages about a spiritual beleif in higher power come on now if
I, wanted to learn about that I, would not go to a movie I would
go to a church it's useless frival that never makes sense because
it's the last thing people would think if an alien invasion was
taking place they would be thinking about survival and staying
alive. In a rural town a family(Mel Gibson,Joaquin Pheonix,Abigail
Breslin,Rory Culkin).With Mel Gibson playing a preist trying to
come to grips with his wifes death and taking care of two kids
as well,they all notice strange things when mysterious giant
crop circles appear. The family notices it and ignores it for
awhile until they find out that more of these circles show up
nationwide and the family finds out that visitors are here from
another planet to invade,The preist does not beleive it until
he confront's one in the very house that the man that is now
involved in his wifes killing but the only way to fight the
aliens is in faith of himself wich even though he's not a
preist anymore by choice cannot overcome his loss in faith
but he has to for his family so that they will come out of
this battle alive and save his family wich he eventually
gains faith in.
  The religious aspect of the film is not so much that is terrible or horrible it's just not done well and the aliens
M.Night Shymalan makes them as vulnerable as the charchters
of his movie. Im sorry but the Alien in Ridley Scott's ALIEN
was much scarier and smarter a lesson Night should learn
from , if an Alien had the technology to travel in a flying
saucer would it just stand there and get hit by a bat and
when the Alien climbs the rooftop as it waste's it time
making a racket and obviously let's the family know it's
presince it's a waste of filmgoers time because we know
these things. M.Night Shymalan does the classic Speilberg
move with not revealing the aliens until almost an hour
into the film but by that time you've already predicted
how the movie will end it's just to predictable of a
film the good thing about The Sixth Sense is that noone
even the best film plotters couldn't figure out the ending

No doubt Mel Gibson's portrayal of a embittered Episcopal priest who has fallen from faith and hope is admirable. His acting alone, along with the others make this a if not an entirely believable movie - an impressive one.  No, there are no space ships, and no, there is no grand assault to repel the invaders, but contrary to one critic's analysis;  what more do you need when you hit an alien with a baseball bat?

1478244,4,B00005JL3T,"In his third major release, M. Night Shyamalan comes close to brilliance, but loses it in the end.  He is a filmmaker who takes risks, generally, but he does not take a big one at the end.  This is unfortunate, but in no way ruins the movie.  It just makes it less than the masterpiece that was ""The Sixth Sense"" and not as intriguing as the criminally underrated ""Unbreakable"".
While some see this film as religious hogwash, it is my opinion that they are missing the larger point.  Yes, it's about Aliens coming to Earth, but the aliens here are not the point of the story.  The point is about faith, family, and how the two interplay.  Seeing the ending as a calling card for religion is short-sighted and foolish.  It is a calling card to have faith in something, anything, be it God, yourself, or your family.  Shyamalan believes that faith is important.  This does not hurt his movie.
On the complaints about the aliens, they are meerly a plot device, a Hitchcokian ""McGuffin"", who only serve to help tell the larger tale.  They are stupid aliens, yes, but their intelligence is not the point.  Their presence is the important factor.
Shyamalan is obviously a skillful director when it comes to staging creepy, tense scenes, but he does remarkable work with actors.  As he did with Bruce Willis in ""Unbreakable"", Shyamalan pulls a subdued performance out of the usually larger than life Mel Gibson.  He also uses Joaquin Phoenix effectively, and get great work out of his supporting cast, including the local sherrif, and a memorable scene with an Army recruiter.  One note though:  Shyamalan should stop playing roles in his movies.  Yes, Hitch did it too, but he never gave himself a key role.  Shyamalan should stick to wordless cameos.
Another aspect of this film is the remarkable performaces by the two kids who play Gibson's son and daughter.  Shyamalan has shown in his previous films that he can do brilliant work with children.  Here, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are pitch-perfect as the slightly scarred offspring of a tragically killed mother and a spiritually angry father.  The scene at the dinner table before the aliens come is sad yet moving, and Shyamalan gets the best out of his cast.
In the end, it is a B-movie with a message, and many different people will take the movie to be more or less than it is.  For me, it goes right next to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" on my DVD shelf.  If you like tense fun that isn't too preachy and makes you think, you'll love ""Signs""",1041465600,,2506,4.6477272727272725

But people, please, get an imagination! If you think the movie is predictable (ALL MOVIES ARE) then you shouldn't be writing a review! Yes there are certain things that happen that you say, ""well what a coincidence,"" but aren't all movies made of coincidences?
This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and I screamed in one part. Yes, I knew what was about to happen on the no nonsense side of my brain but I was totally ingrossed in the movie.
The movie is great because you don't really comprehend what is going on, like the characters. You're sure but you're not sure, you want to be optimistic about the situation, and then again you're leaning more towards the dark side of it. You watch as this family tries to comprehend and deal with the crazyness, outright impossible, but happening our backyard while we watch situation. But like them, you don't know what else is happening in the world except whats on the tv, which is now in the closet (little movie spoiler there.) That key part of the movie is what makes it so believable, and suspensful, and down right terrifing at certain moments!
Like I said, if you have an imagination, you'll enjoy the movie. After its over with you can go back to your skeptic world that aliens and ufos don't exsist. Enjoy!",1041465600,9,1428,4.517374517374518
1478246,5,B00005JL3T,"Ok, I've read a few of the negative reviews that people did on this movie so I thought I'd take the time to defend it for all of you who haven't seen the film but are considering buying it.
Signs was not your typical alien invasion movie.  There aren't any dazzling special effects.  There's no graphic alien attack scenes.  There are no images of the usual global chaos that generally accompany an alien invasion.  This was no ""Independence Day"" type movie.
Rather than doing the usual Alien movie, Shyamalan decides to take a different approach.  If you've seen The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, you should already be familiar with his directing style.  Rather than making a big movie centered around a big event, he takes things to a more personal level.  He takes a character living what appears to be a typical or small life and gives them some extraordinary circumstance to deal with.  Its not about everyone else when it comes to his movies.  The story is never REALLY about the weird events, but rather, about the character's experiences with them.
I really think some people were disappointed in Signs because it wasn't at all what they expected.  They went into the movie thinking it would be all the things I listed that it was not.
Now I'll tell you what it was and hopefully you'll take the time to watch this movie and enjoy it as much as I did.
This was a movie full of both humor and suspense.  Signs is about a family and how they come together to deal with the idea that not only are we not alone in the universe, but that aliens might be preparing an invasion.  Shyamalan manages to make us laugh at all the right moments as well as make us jump back with surprise.  He has a real way of catching us off guard which is one of the reasons why I loved Signs.  Just when you begin to relax, something exciting or scary or strange will happen to put you back on the edge of your seat.
But more importantly, Shyamalan adds something new to the usual formula of alien movies.  He puts the element of faith into the plot.  Not only is the lead character (Mel gibson) dealing with the idea of aliens attacking, but he's also trying to deal with the death of his wife and his lost faith.  The alien invasion causes him to ask the question, does everything happen for a reason?  Or are we all on our own here?
But make no mistake, this is not a movie I'd let a child see.  It gets pretty scary at times so if you're not one who enjoys getting freaked out every 10 minutes, Signs is not for you.
If you are one who enjoys great films... rent or buy signs.  It's one of the best movies I've seen all year.",1041465600,98,2611,4.333333333333333

And they are absolutly right! This movie, in it's brilliance, uses common man's fascinations with little green men to tell the story of faith lost and regained. The struggle between good and evil every man and woman must face. And in the case of the lead character, even a man of religious vocation may not be able to see the light so clearly. This is a story of moral redemption not a ""take me to your leader"" battle for the earth.

He is a normal father, who just wants to protect his family.  What I really like about this movie is the originality.  It is one of few alien movies which do not take the typical prospective of the government.  Instead, it goes the family route.  At times you have no idea what is going on outside of their household.  This makes the movie entertaining, intriguing, and over all fun to watch.  Aside from Mel Gibson, the other actors and actresses make great performances as well.

1478368,5,B00005JL3T,"Most reviews on this film typically falls at one extreme or the other. People who hated the movie almost always point to the aliens being disappointing either visually or intellectually. People who loved it usually fall in two categories - either they enjoyed it at an emotional level in terms of the suspense and mystery and didn't overanalyze it, or they have a filmmaker's mind and see it for the brilliance in areas of the characterization, acting, cinematography and the simple yet powerful examination of the human struggle to find meaning in life. This movie is NOT storyline/plot driven, if you know a little bit about filmmaking, you'll understand when I say that the plot is just a minor player/device in a film whose ""purpose is to evoke pure emotion through the use of skilled acting and direction"" (Roger Ebert).
Stanley Kubrick said there is one type of movie viewers that he hates and do not make films for - the type that can't enjoy a movie simply on the emotional level because they try to analyze everything, yet fail to correctly analyze the movie because it is beyond them intellectually. Kubrick always tries to satisfy at least one of the following: the average Joe moviegoer or the true film critics. This is what M. Night Shyamalan has done with Signs. He didn't bother to explain why the aliens are bipedal, why they do not mix well with water or why they create crop circles (gasp! Isn't that what the movie poster displays!? Oh no! It doesn't follow your expectations! God forbid a movie that gives you something unexpected!). If you want to see sci-fi that attempt to explain xeno-biology or xeno-technology, watch Star Trek: Next Generation TV series. For those of you with good filmmaking background or those who just want to enjoy a great movie that is suspenseful and emotion provoking with a bit of philosophy, this is a film you must not miss.
Oh, one last thing, those of you who think this is a movie to promote religion, what religion does it promote? Bring this movie to a priest/rabbi/whoever and ask him if he would use this as a tool to convert people or ask him to point out where it supports their specific religion. God did not show up anywhere in this movie to make the aliens susceptible to water. God/Allah/Yahweh/Zeus did not come down and save all the religious people. SOMETHING did allow the humans to be saved and Father Graham Hess interprets it as an act of God and thus restores his faith. The moviegoer is free to interpret it as luck, as a supernatural force, as anything and that is the POINT of the movie - people will react differently to explain the cause of events.",1041292800,,2628,4.665948275862069

Night Shyamalan's Signs is  a terrifying and welcome return to the roots of what made movies of this type so great in the past: tension and fear.
A small-town Pennsylvania preacher loses faith and becomes a farmer.  One of his children develops a bizarre habit with drinking water.  His dogs start to become frighteningly agressive, as if some sort of predator were on the loose...
Just remembering the scenes of this movie give me the chills...a clear indication of how well Shyamalan's film-making and direction steer this movie in the direction of utter terror.  Mel Gibson is superb in his role as a preacher turned farmer who slowly begins to realize that all is not so well in this small countryside Pennsylvania town.  When a number of bizarre occurences, and an unforgettably terrifying encounter  both outside his daughter's bedroom window (which is giving me goosebumps just thinking about it) and in his own cornfields in the middle of the night sends his family and other locals into a paranoia fit, he must contend with his own inner struggles and beleifs to help guide his family through this terror.
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the film is that it is so realistic.  The events and occurrences on the film never go beyond unbeleivable...they are all very down to earth(no pun intended) and rational.  People who fear or are generally frightened by the thought of alien invaders will be completely terrified by the film's basic yet beleivable events.  Unlike most alien invasion type films, Shyamalan opts for a seemingly forgotten key in film making: Less is MORE.
Like the Ridley Scott classic Alien, Shyamalan plays more on fear and emotion rather than visual effects.  This may disappoint some, but for most people who see this movie, including myself, it helps to convey a poignant and moving story while keeping you on the edge of your seat with your heart racing and chills running down your spine.  And as with most Shyamalan movies(namely the Sixth Sense), Signs has a message to convey to the audience and has a basic principal to the entire premise.
Overall, Signs stands out as one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen.  It is so basically beleivable that one may lose sleep after seeing this film.  By all means, don't watch this film alone, and don't be embarassed to be frightened by this film either...I sure was, and all others who i've asked said the same thing: Its so realistic, that it's just terrifying.  M. Night Shyamalan does it again...Signs is a must-see movie for any suspense/horror/sci-fi fan or alien afficionado.  Don't pass it up!",1041292800,15,2828,4.936708860759493

We certainly didn't think we would be frightened by some piddling PG-13 movie.
I'm glad to say we were wrong.
'Signs', the story of how one family deals with the horrors of a hostile alien invasion in rural Pennsylvania, is not a technically opulent film. It's more of an extended 'Twilight Zone' episode - but a very good one. What you don't know for sure is scarier than what you know. You're hiding behind closed doors, but the further along the invasion progresses the more you know those doors won't hold long. You think it might be something else, or that the director is trying to trick you, but in the end the trick is that it's exactly what it appears to be.
Sure the ending's a little hard to swallow, but it's forgivable when taken with the whole of the film.

1478410,4,B00005JL3T,"There are people who feels obliged to criticise a movie for what it is not. And there are people who make remarks like ""awesome"" ""excellent"" or ""best"" only for movies with brutal violence, gratuitous sex scenes, offending contents or simply profanity-filled scripts. Now they could be two distinguished group of viewers, yet they could very well be one. But why? Because by doing so it make them different. It make them a part of the group who ""dare to push the envolope"". For them, a movie is nothing unless it is controversial, unless it is capable of upsetting the general publics one way or another.
""Signs"" is anything but described as above. It is a movie showcasing what a gifted Director/Writer could do. It also gives Mel Gibson, a great performer whose talents is only overshadowed by his sex symbol/tough guy image, a significant chance to show his maturity. Sure, it is flawed, and it's supernatural theme is indeed not everyone's cup of tea, but it is often misjudged for what it is not. Why does it have to make sense to a T? It is about Aliens, afterall. Unless you are one, how could you explain why they would do something and why they would not? It is the same as if I ask if human are so smart, why would we forget to take the keys out the door or forgot to turn the stove off?

1478414,3,B00005JL3T,"Shame for a director who puts himself on the map with the Sixth Sense goes on to swing and miss with Unbreakable and now rather dissapoints with Signs. Perhaps the order of his movies should've been exactly the other way around because now he's becoming a ""take cover, the new film from Shyamalan is out"" proposition.
  Shame twice because ""Signs"" could have been a great film and only because someone forgot to hire a script writer the film it was not.
  But i'd rather start with the positives. Despite the incredible plot holes i actually enjoyed this b-flick. I enjoyed it because :
a)Mel Gibson, after years of pointless trash films (culminating with the ultra silly What Women Want recently) finally plays a role in which he does not annoy. Now that is news.
b) Because the film holds throughout its b-movie atmosphere and not since the superb Jeepers Creepers about a year ago have i seen a film that maintains its b-movieness in such a convincing way. Why is that good? Because it helps you forget this is Hollywood.
c) Because most of the characters (except the aliens, sadly) are pretty ok and for the most part humorous.
  But that's where the candy runs out:
1. The aliens come through as dumb as a wall. I won't give away why (for those that haven't seen the film) but man, this must be the sorriest alien invasion ever conceived by anybody on film or not. It's a joke to even call it an invasion. It aint even a farce. What it is is a bunch of aliens full of phobias trying to save their skin and get back home to their sofas.
2. The gapping holes in the script never let up. They go on from the beggining of it and last through to the very (bad) ending. It becomes worse when one thinks that these scenario lapses were perfectly avoidable. Classic case of ""what was the script writer thinking???"" But, like i said, there wasn't any script writer. I do have the lingering suspicion that Mel wrote the story himself (in which case everything becomes explainable).
3. The ending, and particularly, the last 30 seconds of the film classify it as a ""bomb"". You need talent to invent an ending as bad as this. Or you need to be working in Hollywood too long. Even if this film had been a great film (and it had massive potential to be) the ending would've totally destroyed it. Utterly unconvincing, and totally beyond the obligatory film-ruining ""happy ending"", it left me with a feeling of disgust.

Well, there's a lot of that kind of stuff going on, and the punchline is so schmaltzy (bascially--SPOILER ALERT--belive in God and souls and other theological stuffs) that the movie is unintentionally funny.

Some people have critizied his works in the past, esp. Unbreakable for it's downfall in the box office.  If people really cared about movies, and the art laid within them then negative remarks would be out of the question when it comes to Shyamalan's works.  I say this because most people go to movies just for pure entertainment. There are those that go not for just entertainment, but also for the pleasure in experiencing facinating art at work.  Shymalan ties, spiritual healing, an alien invasion, and unbelievable sight and sound into Signs.  Now keep in mind that with any sci-fi adventure things seem silly and sometimes rediculous, but it is science ficition and it all comes with the package.

I'm sure that with the care the aliens put in making the crop circles and every other aspect of their behavior they would have know about something like what prooved to be their downfall.  Also the fact that the aliens were either so brave or so dumb to get out of their crafts to wage hand-to-hand combat with us? Isn't that an other potential way of ultimate defeat? Enough said about the alien part of the plot, taking the other non alien parts of the movie and ultimately tying them all together was a good idea, flawed, but a good idea in the least.  The movie was also entertaining since it kept you on the edge of your seat, it let you to see what an alien invasion might feel like if you and your family had to live through it.  Not everyone is able to fly a fighter plane to take out the alien menace like what happens in ""Independence Day"".  So therefore if you can put up with some major holes and just want to be entertained than this is a great movie to get.

While the Sixth Sense was a very good film, it is definitely not Shyamalan at his absolute best- which I think right now lies within Signs- which is a film that covers issues of faith and reality and so much more.  What I also don't understand is the negativity towards Unbreakable.  That is a brillant film and completely undeserving of any negativity.  Maybe its because Shyamalan refuses to conform to the Hollywood ""formula"" that has everyone only holding The Sixth Sense as his masterpiece film.

1478687,5,B00005JL3T,"This is a superlative movie on many levels, and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, proves that he is a force with which to be reckoned. After his blockbuster hit, ""The Sixth Sense', the viewing audience expected great things from him. When his next film, ""Unbreakable"", did not draw the raves that ""The Sixth Sense"" did, the viewing public anxiously awaited his next film to see if Shyamalan could, once again, hit it out of the ballpark. With ""Signs"", he confirms that he is, indeed, one of the directorial greats.
This film is about many things. It is about loss of a loved one. It is about family. It is about relationships. It is about things that we cannot control. It is about the inexplicable. It is about destiny. Yes, it is most certainly about alien invasion. It is also ultimately about one man's crisis of faith.
The film is a wonderful, scary, and amazing film. It centers around the Hess family, who has recently sustained the loss of Colleen Hess (Patricia Kalember) in a terrible accident one night. Wife to Graham (Mel Gibson), mother to Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and sister-in-law to Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), her death was felt on many levels. Graham, a minister in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was so distraught over the senseless (or so he thinks) death of his wife, that he left his ministry and is now living a purely secular life with their children and his brother, Merrill. Graham simply cannot understand why God has seemingly forsaken him. The death of his wife has divested him of his faith, and he finds himself struggling in the world without it.
One morning, Graham discovers crop circles in the cornfield in front of his house. Other strange things begin to happen, all while he is trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in a world that has suddenly changed in a way that he could never have envisioned. Worldwide, crop circles are mysteriously appearing, seemingly strategically, and, before one knows it, alien invaders are here. They are creepy. They are scary. They do not come in peace. The focus of the film is not so much on the alien invaders, however, but on how the family responds and interacts in this time of crisis.
There are some very frightening scenes in this film. They are all the more frightening for what one does not see rather than what one does see. There are some aspects of ""The Blair Witch Project"" at work here. Shyamalan certainly understands the concept that less is sometimes more and uses it to great effect. The effective use of tension by the director is one of the great strengths of this film. Sly, subtle humor is also used to great advantage. The other important component of the film is the acting.
There is not one bad performance in this film. Shyamalan, who normally gives himself a brief cameo in his own films, gave himself the part of Ray Reddy, the man who was the catalyst for the tragedy that enveloped the Hess household. He gives a more than credible performance. Abigail Breslin is simply delightful as little Bo, a child too young to fully comprehend what is going on around her, but who, nonetheless, reacts to its shifting permutations. Rory Culkin (yes, Macauley's younger brother in real life) gives a wonderfully intense performance as Bo's big brother. A somewhat singleminded child, he immediately becomes a believer in extraterrestrials and tries to gain an understanding on his own of what is to come.
It is Mel Gibson, however, along with Joaquin Phoenix, who ratchets up the ante. Mel Gibson gives a beautifully nuanced and sensitive performance, playing it totally straight with occasional flashes of humor. It is a performance of a conflicted man who cannot bear what has happened to him and does not reach an understanding until it is almost too late. In the end, he is able to see how some of what has happened to his family has had a semblance of a greater design. Even his wife's last words to him, so seemingly meaningless before, grow rich with meaning at the end.
Joaquin Phoenix is one of the younger generation's most talented actors. He infuses the role of Merrill with a vulnerability that is, at times, heartbreaking. Yet, somehow the viewer knows that the Hess family can count on him to be there for them one hundred percent. While he is not so conflicted as his brother Graham, however, he seems to need validation.
As the film barrels towards its climactic ending, scenes leading up to Colleen's last moments are woven throughout the film. This serves to show the viewer that the events of the present have meaning when grounded in the context of the past. It will come full circle in the end. This is a wonderful, beautiful, suspenseful, and scary film that is well worth seeing, and I eagerly await release of the DVD.",1039046400,,4760,4.736144578313253

Reviewing this film without giving too much away is almost impossible, so all I will say is this: M. Night Shyamalan is a master storyteller.  More than any other writer/director working today, he seems to understand the awesome power of a story well-told.  It's a rare pleasure to be confidently able to hand yourself over to a filmmaker for two hours to be toyed with, manipulated, deceived and misled, and ultimately stunned by a revelation.  But Shyamalan somehow manages to do all of that every time.  In the wasteland of predictable trash that flows daily out of Hollywood's slave pits, he reminds us that a good story can still hold us completely in its thrall. Mel Gibson as a minister might be a little hard to buy here, and the overt religiosity of Shyamalan's particular take on `serendipity' might push some viewers away.  But this is still a very good film, and love or hate Shyamalan's personal philosophy, you still have to thank him for that.",1039046400,2,1141,4.795918367346939

1478692,4,B00005JL3T,"When ""Signs"" is creepy and scary, it is really crepy and scary.  But when it is ridiculous, it is hopelessly ridiculous, and even laughable.  Many people, including me, saw the film with the first view in mind; others, though outnumbered, saw it with the latter, and have their good reasons.  Whichever category you belong to, you just pick it.
The actors are all good; Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, who lost his wife in the tragic accident, is a sad, lonely and disillusioned father, growing corn in the quiet countryside.  Joaquin Phoenix is no less effective as one of his family members, but it is the two newcomers Rory Culkin (younger brother of more famous Culkins) and Abigail Breslin (sister of Spencer, who played a kid with Bruce Willis in ""The Kid"") who really steal the show.  The story goes around these four members, who encounter the ""signs"" created on the vast cornfield.  One of the kids believes it has a meaning; the other claims she saw ""it.""  And it won't take a long time for the two adults to be convinced.  But of what?
Of what?  This part is the key of this very unique suspence film. so I cannot disclose it.  The only thing I can say is that the director M. Night Shyamalan's atomospheric approaches to create a creepy feelings, which can be found in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" still work, and though ""Signs"" is deeply flawed here and there, the film can scare us not a little.  His hand-made style of filmmaking, clearly based on Hitchcock's thrillers, is done in a ""less is more"" fashion, which is now something rare these days.
As James Hewton Howard's score suggests (listen to the opening number, which reminds you of one film starring Melanie Griffith's mother), the film is actually old-fashioned thriller.  But it tries to achieve something more, and then it shows its shortcomings.  The script attempts to be deep in philosophical meanings, but it totally fails.  The last decision doens't require the logics the film shows in its flashbacks, but it is director himself to be blamed.  Not that his directing skill is bad; rather, Shyamalan himself appears in the film, as he did in two previous films, but this time his role is much bigger one, including a dialogue with Mel Gibson.  Hitch was wise not to take his signature cameos too seriously (in fact, he thought it as obligatory task) while Shyamalan goes much further, taking up the role which should have gone to a professional actor.
The whole film build up tension tactfully, but it is the skills of the director that propel the whole story.  Many would answer, if asked, that ""it"" would not happen in the way it is described when it should really happen.  If you start to think that way ... and I confess I though a bit that way ... the film may look too ludicurous, and that is the reason for the complaints of some reviewers.  That is quite understandable when you see one homevideo sequence -- what do you think if you watch THAT on TV?  Do you take it seriously?
So, let's forget those parts.  Let's not think that so-called mystery circles are nothing but somebody's practical jokes.  ""Signs"" goes smoothly as long as you keep fending off these doubts, and I think you can because of the film's well-measured pace and two cute kids.  Yes, those two child actors are the best thing of the film, which in the most unexpected moment, gives humor to the film.  With them and its eerie atomosphere, the film will be worth your time.",1038182400,,3439,4.636963696369637

1478784,2,B00005JL3T,"1 part ET, 1 part Night of The Living Dead, 1 part War of the WOrlds, 1 part book of Job adds up to not very much.  The shots from ET are intrusive ( the corn field, throwing the ball to the alien in the corn, kitchen knives, the little Eliot clone, the little Drew Barrymore clone, and Mel as the dithering single parent), while Living Dead was simply far more effective at trapping people in a PA farmhouse while the world goes mad (which Romero did with no budget), while War of The Worlds was far more convincing in the Earth-toxic-to-aliens scenario. Shyamalan dabbles in several genres and efforts at homage, botching them all. Shyamalan was intrusive in his cameo, the aliens were dumb (in so many senses), and in rural PA nearly every home has a hunting rifle so the invasion would have sounded like D-Day. Plus Mel SLEEPS through the invasion.
Finally, the religious angle is from the book of Hallmark. In the Old Testament, Job lost his family but kept his faith even while his neighbors told him that it must a punishment from God, until God shows up and tells them ""Hey (bad stuff) happens, and I won't tell you why, but Job kept his faith so he will be restored.""  In Signs the scenario is totally opposite - Mel loses his wife and faith, but his neighbors support him spiritually, and not to worry because in his world (bad stuff) does not happen, and we always know God is pulling the strings for a purpose. Sorry folks, that isn't the Bible. God lets planes hit building, and he may have even let an asteroid kill the dinosaurs. People that considered this a spiritually important movie may want to check on the official beliefs of their church because they may inadvertently have been practicing the wrong religion.",1037664000,24,1732,4.548076923076923

1478786,5,B00005JL3T,"Before I saw this movie (the day it came out) the only movie that had truly scared me was the original 'Halloween.' Michael Myers now has company. And like the 1978 horror classic, 'Signs proves that it isn't what you see, but what you don't see that will eventually get you.
This movie was unbelievable! Scary, tense, suspensful and clever are all words that I could use to describe but I don't think that they would get my point across as to how much I really enjoyed this movie. This movie made being scared fun. This movie could has so many elements to it; Sci-fi, horror, drama, suspense, action, comedy; Shyamalan has really outdone himself, even on the sixth sense. Which I didn't think he could do. Its as though he tells you what is coming but that you are still going to be surprised when it gets here.
I loved the whole science versus religion theme of the movie. I thought it was excellently tied in at the end. The biggest plus was that every element was tied together nicely, and in doing so, form a real question about faith in our culture. And if you think about it this whole movie is filmed and thought out in a way that only adds to the tension.
The tension created by this movie is unlike any I've seen in recent memory, and could give Hitchcock a run for his money.
Cinematography, Plot and direction aside I would be blind if I didn't point out the Oscar-worthy performances of Mel Gibson and Joquain Phoenix. They compliment each other so well that this movie wouldn't have been half of what it was without them.
This is not only a movie to see, but a movie to own (DVD Release 7 jan.) even if ultimately it will lose some of its suspense the more you watch it. But oh well, everyone remembers their first time right?",1037145600,14,1740,4.390092879256966

  Basic plot- Farmer Graham(Mel Gibson) wakes up one morning to discover strange symbols in his cornfield. Slowly, things get even stranger. The local animals start acting strange. He sees disturbing shadow figures prowling around his house and feild at night. Crop circles are popping up all over the world...
  This movie has genuine charm to it. The first time I saw it, it gave me horrible creeps(coming from someone who thought 'The Exorcist' wasn't scary). It still makes me laugh. It has great suspense, and also great family value as well.
  The one star taken off is for the aliens actual appearance once they come out of the shadows...their faces are more comic than creepy. Another reason a star is taken off, is because Mr Shyamalan(I know I misspelled that) called sharers('bootleggers') douchebags.

It seems some people were disappointed in this film though. The only thing I would say to them is ""What did you expect... another Independence Day?? While that film was a huge money maker and entertaining for it's special effects, I felt this film was very cleverly written, well put together, and definately more realistic. M. Night's use of camera angles and sound creates real suspense. It was filmed from the viewpoint of one family, just like we would individually see it if it was happening to ourselves. Also one cool thing I liked is that a lot of the suspense happens during the daylight... which means it's no longer safe during the day either.. :)

He uses sci-fi to keep things interesting to deliver a message about hope and about faith that all things happen in their own time and for their own reasons.

I realize the scriptwriters wanted to put in the eirie part of Mrs. Gibson's (well, whoever she was) unfortunate accident and it's relationship to the rest of the plot.  That was neat, but not enough to make a good movie.
The politically correct part is where Mel Gibson lives out on a farm and does not own a shotgun (or any gun for that matter).  That is really unbelievable, and I assume this was the case in order for the screenwriters or director to show their political colors.  Anyone who lives on a farm would have a shotgun, at the very least.  It would have helped a great deal with these aliens, too, though I am not giving away anything here.
Of course, by this point you should have already suspended your disbelief in a race that can build spacecraft that hover in a 1-g environment, but cannot seem to kill anyone without their bare hands.  Hmmm.... see what I mean about unbelieveable?
What was Mel Gibson thinking when taking this part?  As the Road Warrior Mad Max, I don't think he would have put up with this much from a bunch of scrawny, flem-covered aliens.

The film in its entirity is extremely engrossing and the reason it would be regarded as 'scary' is simply because imagining yourself in the same situation makes you feel insecure.  The outstandingly well cast and directed Signs makes all other alien films look a tad corny although it has to be said the aliens look a little like gerkins. The films follows the unfortunate life of a former reverand whos wife has recently been the subject of a tragic accident. His brother Meryl, a former baseball player (no its not as corny as it sounds) comes to help out the poor reverand raise his two children, one of which is the fantastic McAuley Culkin's younger brother. Once there in the tiring wooden famrhouse the two start to be the subjects of some strange goings on. Firstly the crops are strangely flattened into a crop pattern and a strange figure is seen by the reverend creeping on the roof. As they rush out to scare the suspect (the brothers who had been terrorizing the reverend for quite some time) they find that the being is far more agile than they first thought, chasing it as fast as they can the figure bounds onto the roof and out of site. It is from now on, incidentally about 15 minutes into the film that the action starts. And it soon becomes evident that these crop circles have appeared over 400 major cities and the strange UFO's have taken pose over every major city. The attack maneuver is ready to go. Stricken by panic the family is left with two options, either to make leave for the water, as it seems the patterns are clear out of the way of water, or god fobid board up the house with freakin ply-wood. And guess which option they choose. Itd only be the ply-wood. Overall this movie is a cracker and to tell you any more would spoil the film but by all means this film is very scary for a 12 rating and it would be advised to wear some brown underwear for those jumpy moments. The cast and directing is phenomenal and the film strings up constant surprises whereas still keeping the story simple. HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR A FILM WITH A CRACKING, EASY TO UNDERSTAND STORY. not many i think youll find.

Just because SIGNS doesn't fit in with either of Shyamalan's previous work doesn't mean that there aren't plot twists in store. There's plenty.
  SIGNS concentrates on the effects an outer space invasion has on one family (Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) instead of taking the INDEPENDENCE DAY route. Without giving to anything away, it begins with crop circles and then transpires into a domestic siege.
  Gibson and Phoenix (who is always great and very underused) hold the film together as the two brothers, both bringing goofiness and dramatic despair to their characters. All in all, a great film.

In Pennsylvania, crop circles are found on the farm of Graham Hess (Gibson), the town's former reverend. The circles test Hess's faith as he attempts to find out the truth behind them.
Mel Gibson gives what is perhaps his best performance as a damaged father trying to do what he has come to believe is best for his children. Joaquin Phoenix, in quite a turn from his Oscar nominated performance as the antagonist in Gladiator, provides some humorous comic relief.
This is a minimalist thriller. As repeatedly demonstrated by Hitchcock, and to a lesser extent Spielberg, what you don't see can be far more intense than what you do see. Director M. Night Shyamalan takes this to heart and uses lighting and sound to their full, suspenseful potential to indicate the presence of an other-worldly menace. James Newton Howard's Herrmann-esque musical score also adds greatly to the tension and mood.
Signs falls apart during its outrageous finale that also tends to be unintentionally funny, and in my opinion, anti-climatic. All the atmosphere and anxiety that Shyamalan had built up throughout the film is abruptly released, resulting in an unsatisfying climax.",1033776000,7,1320,4.97737556561086

Gasp in disbelief at the appalling costume and its complete Naffness. From now on the film becomes a B-Rate SCI-FI that renders the good build up as nothing more than a joke.
Saviour: Luckily the casting is superb with Mel Gibson & Joaquin Phoenix adding a humorous quirk to the film ensuring it doesn't take itself too seriously.
With all aside the film is OK if you're willing to believe anything but if you're sceptical or critical at all, don't bother.",1033603200,,1035,4.540106951871658

1478972,4,B00005JL3T,"I love a movie that makes me remember it. And I found myself thinking back to ""Signs"" a number of times. The film had a significant impact on me. There are some great scenes to replay: Mel Gibson getting his son breathing during an asthma attack, the group-hug at the dinner table, and the pep-talks Mel gives his kids at the ""darkest hour"". I found myself interested not only by the basic ""aliens"" plot but also by the effect the plot had on the family, and also by the message of the film, concerning synchronicity and spirituality.
Talking of the aliens plot, I was lucky enough to go along to this movie not being aware that it was about an all-out alien invasion. Hence I was increasingly open-mouthed as the invasion took place. Initially I was wondering if the prospect of the invasion was just paranoia on the part of the characters. But as more and more fell into place a sense of unreality began to overtake the proceedings. So believable it was unbelievable, is the best way I can put it.
I think the reason for this was that normally alien invasion movies, even if they start on a local level, eventually pan out to a national or international level. Presidents, generals and word-heroes dominate the proceedings. Great pronouncements of scientific and philosophic profundity stream from the mouths of the earnest cast members. An example of this would be Independence Day, a movie I did enjoy. However ""Signs"" is Independence Day from the point of view of a crop-farming family in the middle of nowhere. It is a masterly inversion, a ""micro"" view of such an occurrence. For example, the tragedy of the family losing its mother a year before the events in the script is almost as important in the movie as the tragedy of the alien invasion.
The classic HG Well's story ""War of the Worlds"" is also done from the point of view of a single person. But that person eventually travels towards London and sees great events pass. However the family in Signs stay on their isolated farm all through the invasion, and even their television gets cut off, further isolating them. (Partly because of this, and like Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", we don't really see an invader directly for the whole of the attack.) Some of the television footage is great by the way, especially the scene of the amateur footage of an alien appearing at a kids' birthday party. Interestingly, the director's use of the camera is more like that of someone filming a newscaster on TV. He frames people individually as if they were speaking directly to the camera. There doesn't seem to be the same degree of panning and sweeping shots that I am used to in standard Hollywood fare.
Apart from the wonderful Back-to-front-Independence-Day nature of the movie, it has an interesting spiritual commentary. There is a kind of a ""twist"" as found in other movies by the same director, like The Sixth Sense, however the twist in this movie is far more subtle and thought provoking, in my opinion. (Though no doubt some will disagree.) I suspect the spiritual element may alienate the less spiritually-inclined, but for me it just added to what was already a interestingly complex movie with many strands.
The final plus point for this movie was the cast and characters. The effects of the invasion upon the family is just fabulous to watch. I was totally caught up in their relationships. Mel Gibson does great, though seems a bit out of character in what was one of the best parts of the movie: the revival scene in the basement. Mel's brother in the movie dove-tails with him perfectly, and the kids are just excellent!
The only negative point for me would have to be the ending. The gassing and following survival (see the movie to understand what I'm talking about) didn't seem to fit into the flow of the movie at all. The point about synchronicity had already been well made. The asthma that allows the survival seems a little ""clever-clever"" to me, and just seems like the director showing off, rather than attempting a satisfying narrative finish. If I was one of those people who coloured a whole movie by its ending, then that could almost spoil the effect for me in some ways. However the rest of the movie was just so fascinating that it did not spoil it. I suspect I will watch ""Signs"" again at some point in the future, just to return to that strange eerie world of the isolated, emotionally troubled family, during an alien stealth-invasion.",1033430400,,4422,4.699742268041237

Everybody told me that this movie is really scary and that everybody screamed and it's just engrossing...but from what I saw....it's wasn't. Sign was far far away from being engrossing and it was slow are some moments. Plus it had a really dull ending that is just predictable if you thought about it a little bit. The movie could have been good if it didn't try that hard to be good. The movie did have it's highlights such as the scene in the neighbors kitchen and the humor that the director put in the movie which was also surprising to me. I didn't expect there to be humor in such a movie but the way that they put it in made the movie good. Even though the idea was good this movie just didn't work for me.
Graham Hess(played by Mel Gibson)is a former priest but stopped preforming his duties after the death of his wife Colleen six months ago. He is single and raising his two kids Morgan and Bo with the help of his brother Merril(played by Joaquin Phoenix).Grahem is a farmer who plants his crops like a normal man untill one mourning there is a strange sign planted inside of his crops. A crop circle! Then the dogs start to act strange causing them to kill one of them and Bo's old baby monitar starts to pick up stange signals. All over the country there are crop circles being reported by farmers and over big cities there are thousands of lights overhead just there. Horror begins to spread through the house when those two words are told by all...
IT'S HAPPENING!

1478975,3,B00005JL3T,"Signs tries to have a bob each way on too many horses in the race for it to turn up a net winner. The premise is simple, and schlock-ish enough: Mysterious corn circles appear all over the world, explicable by none but the proverbial crazed Doctor Hans Zarkov, formerly of NASA, whose best shot is that a greater intelligence from another world is here to say a big hello to planet earth. Maybe to make friends. Maybe to invade. Maybe to take humans for food. They're clever than us, so who knows?

So far, so ID4. The cinematic hat-tipping doesn't stop there, though: Independence Day begets Close Encounters of the Third Kind, begets ET, begets Invasion of the Body Snatchers, begets (creepily and effectively) The Birds.

But all this thriller/Sci Fi schtick is a ruse: the film actually ruminates on a few topics more cerebral than that, and to a large extent the thriller element just gets in the way.

For example: it doesn't become clear till fairly late in the piece what is causing the crop circles. Up to that point, Mel Gibson and family spend considerable energy chasing rustling corn cobs around their back yard. Despite how it sounds, this is eerie, and makes a point (of which something has been made in the press notices on this film) about the new American Sense Of Unease. In the same way that Invasion of the Body Snatchers commented on the McCarthyist programme in the 1950s, there is good mileage to be made in the observation that, without much prompting, fully grown men will cack their pants when the wind blows on the plants over their back fence. But the force of that point evaporates the moment a rubbery green man pops out of the foliage and legs it, Benny Hill style, past the back porch and down the lane.

The ""Signs"", it turns out, aren't really the crop circles at all, and this is the other major bone I have to pick with this film. This is a simple matter of preference, and I don't mark the film down on it at all, but simply mention for the record that I think it's bogus: The film has, from the very start, a pretty obvious metaphysical/religious angle (Gibson plays an ex-priest who has lost the faith) and, while it's finally addressed late in the film, the issue continually dangles throughout, hovering just so as you know it's there, only you don't know which side of the fence the film will come down on. It's like watching a golfer take a really long birdie putt. Well, and without giving the game away, it's firmly struck, the ball rolls true, and ... in the last yard it breaks violently the wrong way and careers down a very fast green and into a bunker.

Bogey. Enough said.

1479055,3,B00005JL3T,"There are some wonderful things about ""Signs"", M. Night Shyamalan's latest cinematic offering.  Its presentation is almost unparalleled; from the opening credits, we're swept away into a world of uncertainty and dreaded expectation.  The opening credit sequence is simple, but extremely powerful, with towering words and booming music.  My heart jumped into my throat and stayed there through much of the rest of the film.  Shymalan is extremely talented in creating atmosphere; the thrills and chills are exquisitely choreographed.
The performances are pretty solid, too.  Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are terrific as Mel Gibson's young children, and Cherry Jones is wonderful, as always.  Gibson is very evocative as a grieving widower, but at times I felt he was drowning in spiritually-conflicted pathos.  Similarly, I enjoyed aspects of Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Gibson's younger brother, but there was some scenery chewing evident.
In addition, the climax of the film left me cold.  After a devastatingly chilling lead-up, I felt deflated.  I appreciated the message at the end (which gave an additional meaning to the title), but it seemed awfully pat.
I'm glad I saw this film, but I wouldn't consider it great.  In the end, a movie needs more than atmosphere to elevate it to something above mere entertainment.",1032739200,5,1330,5.320574162679426
1479056,2,B00005JL3T,"Firstly there are reasons to like this film, most of which relate to the visually pleasing stylisation which echoes Hitchcock & early Spielberg. The director obviously has a talent for conveying suspense through subtle image - a trait which made the Sixth Sense so enjoyable. Like the Sixth Sense the first half of this film builds plenty of atmosphere through a perceived threat that we are only shown glimpses of. The films main themes of loss of faith and greater meaning are channelled through Mel Gibson's character, a pastor whose wife has died.
In an almost patronising way Gibson is made to eat his 'cynical' words as the events that unfold around him suggest life experiences have a greater universal meaning & connection than his jaded belief that everything is random & unrelated suggests.
The main problem with this film is the events that occur are hard to swallow. The aliens that are apparanly intent on taking over planet earth aren't able to bust down a bolted door, nor can they withstand an attack with a baseball bat - you would expect a species colonising other planets to be slightly more resilient than that. On top of this the aliens are featured far too prominently towards the end of the film, they look ridiculous and further undermine the weakening plot.
This film tries to do too much and ends up being neither interesting philosophical pontification nor scary movie.",1032739200,6,1396,4.869747899159663
1479057,2,B00005JL3T,"...but after thinking about this movie for a while, I liked it less and less.
On the surface, it's a neat idea.  An alien-invasion story given a personal twist by focussing in on a single family, with emphasis on how it affects them and their lives.  I thought the loss-of-faith angle was well explored.
But on further reflection, I started realizing how superficial it all was.  A clergyman losing faith because his wife was killed?  That's a time when people usually turn to their faith, and become stronger in it (in my experience), and not just reject it wholesale.  Yes, it does happen...but for a clergyman to do it, that must indicate that his faith was very weak, and that he had no business being in a position of spiritual authority.  And, of course, his faith returns at the end...it changes with the wind, it seems!  The final scene is unlikely and silly, and could have been handled in a more realistic and thoughful manner.  Shyamalan wanted to do a movie about faith, but sadly, he was unable to look any deeper than the surface.
As for the alien invasion part of the story...it's stupid.  Just plain stupid.  Alien transmissions intercepted by baby monitors?  Silly.  And the final way in which the aliens are dispatched makes NO sense whatsoever.  (I won't reveal it.)  But it's on a level of stupidity that if you think about it for more than five seconds, you'll realize that the aliens should have been unable to leave their saucers at all.  Shyamalan has talked about how he tried to do the best thriller he could.  He failed.  The sci-fi elements of the story are stupid, stupid, stupid, and Shyamalan should be ashamed of himself.
On the upside, Gibson's performance was good, but not exceptional.  Joaquin Phoenix was OK, the kids were below average.  The lady cop was cool, though.  And it was tense and exciting at times.
But...this is just B-movie tripe pretending to be profound and meaningful, when it's not.",1032393600,4,1937,4.708333333333333

I almost feel asleep watching the movie and it didn`t really pick up until the end, and even the end was horrible and made no sense what so ever.

1479059,4,B00005JL3T,"A few years ago M. Night Shyamalan proved himself as a major player with his sleeper hit `The Sixth Sense', following it up with the critically appraised yet less accessible `Unbreakable' later on.  Now he tackles aliens, along with the issue of how September 11th has affected us all.  The set-up has Gibson as a bereaved priest who has lost his faith after his wife died in a car accident a year ago, now living with his brother Joaquin Phoenix and two children.  When crop circles start appearing he assumes it's a hoax, yet as disturbing facts come to light we swiftly realised that this is the work of sinister alien life forms and that an invasion signalling the end of life as we know it is at hand.
Obviously this won't be to everyone's taste.  Alien movies are a hard thing to get right - should it be part parody or should it be taken literally?  For the most part Shyamalan chooses the latter, and thankfully so as the few attempts at humour often fall flat, especially with a script that at least in the beginning is clunky at best.  But that isn't really what anyone goes to see a Shyamalan (or more often than not any horror flick) for, but to be chilled, freaked out and to see how he'll tackle a difficult subject.  This is done very well, especially through inspired use of photography that makes it appear as if it is taken by some secret voyeur; indeed, the sense that some ominous force (God? Aliens?  Who knows?) is watching is palpable throughout.  Whether the camera is sweeping through fields of corn or studying a darkened room there always seems to be a feel that something is just off screen ready to pounce.  There are also some inspired turns, with Gibson underplaying effectively and supported more than ably by the young actors that play his children, both of whom are superb.  In fact, it's only really in Phoenix that there is any problem, and it certainly has nothing to do with his acting but more with the fact that a clearly talented actor has been, to an extent, wasted in a strangely stereotypical role.
All in all though Shyamalan goes for the route of human horror rather than blood and guts, with more and more focus being leant to a family in crisis as the impending invasion looms.  One scene in particular, where Gibson tries to force his family into having a happy last meal together and they all end up in tears.  As he showed in `The Sixth Sense', an unseen horror is a much greater one and this is neatly balanced by the mixture of feelings the family has to a threat from the skies, in an obvious yet sensitively played metaphor for terrorism.  If, when the aliens finally do appear, they are a little disappointing, this appears to be more of a budget problem than anything else and the ending is pulled off very well indeed.  Whilst it may not be quite as excitingly different as `The Sixth Sense', it certainly is an excellent follow-up.",1032307200,3,2890,4.520153550863723
1479060,5,B00005JL3T,"After he became famous because of his talent to make a cliche to something which is realistic and emotional, M. Night Shyamalan is a director you can easily put next to the other Big Boys like Ridley Scott or Tim Burton. Now, he returns to complete something which he calls a trilogy. A trilogy of realistic and dramatic, suspensefull thrillers. And it seems like he is aiming for a place next to the Big Boss, Steven Spielberg. Not only because of his attempt to make Aliens new again (something Spielberg also did some years ago with his Close Encounters of the Third Kind) but also by showing that he has a brilliant vision, and now he is ready to entertain a very wide range of audience.
The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were, although handling themes who were very much fiction, still very serious, emotional and above all; slow. With his new attempt of re-inventing a cliche, he changed a lot and still kept a lot the same. To start with the similarities, next to the main story line, there's also a plot about a man having to cope with the loss of his wife and losing his faith. Having faith in something seems to be the main theme of the movie; a pastor having to regain his faith in God, and his children who do or do not believe in Aliens who are taking over the world.
This, of course, gives the movie something we have missed in a lot of blockbusters lately: depth. It also provides the much needed emotions and realism set agianst a story which is, at first, totally unconvincing. The mix of these two elements makes the whole movie much more believable and thereby also way more suspensefull. And as before, the movie never gets really violent.
The movie also continues in the tradition of the director showing up in a cameo. Only this time his cameo has grown into an important character which was, to say the least, a bit surprising. But hey, the man does a great job and it makes the character really stick out, which is very important.
But the most surprising element of all, which leads us to the differences between the previous 2 of his movies and this one, is the wit and humour at moments you need a relief. And this is at times really needed, because next to the tension you really feel in your body when sitting at the edge of your seat, you also get a fair amount of shock reactions (even more as in The Sixth Sense) All this adds up to the most intense motion picture experiences we have seen in, well, quite a while. And if you add to this a storyline which is faster in giving information and richer in action sequences, you get a movie which a very wide audience should see.
To come to a conclusion, I could fairly say that, because of the much Shyamalan-elements, the fans of the director won't be disappointed. And because of the more commercial style, everyone who never really liked a movie of M. Night before should give Signs a try as well. If they like a good suspense movie, they are in for a wonderfull motion picture experience.
And don't worry about the ending, like I did; although it doesn't leave much room for a deep discussion afterwards, it certainly will leave you satisfied.",1032307200,,3122,4.469352014010508

Mel Gibson looks like he's seventy years old. His kids are so cute you want to vomit. And his Brother, Joaquin Phoenix, Looks to be 30. I guess their Mother's reproductive organs didn't stop working after 40 years!
This movie has about as much suspense as overdosing on Mylanta. The plot is rather basic. They find crop circles in a field full of corn. Who's crop it is is a mystery. I guess after denouncing his priesthood (Gibson is a priest in the movie) He decided to grow friggen corn instead. Anyhow, The dog acts weird and his daughter starts drinking alot of water. The director makes a forgettable appearance as the quiet veternarian. His acting is similar to the whole film, Awful!
This movie is designed for people who are incapable of enjoying a real movie. Not only is the director annoying in the movie and interviews, He also gets the funding to make movies like this. If this had no big publicity campaign, No-one would have seen it, Because on quality alone, This film fails miserably.

Like in all my reviews, I am not going to waste my time telling you that you NEED to see this movie... BUT... I will point out the aspects of what makes it a truly wonderful film.
Being a film student I have had the chance to study M. Night Shyamalan's use of placing certain items in the film that will, or already has, reflect events to come. Such as: A red door nob in ""The Sixth Sense"". Is it just me, or was Signs chock-full of circles and stars. I mean... THEY WERE EVERYWHERE! Stars on Mel Gibson's bed! Circle on the wall paper! Everywhere. Truly brilliant in my opinion. Hats off to Shyamalan!
The score in the film has got to be one of the most chilling scores to date. Reminds me all to well of the haunting score from ""The Others"", which was not used to make you jump out of your seat, rather pull you deeper into the movies fear-envoking scenes.
I can honsetly say that Signs terrified me... not visually... but with sound. A dog barking, then squealing in pain, gives you a mental picture of ""what [...] is happening out there?""
Mel Gibson's performance as a priest who has lost his faith is absolutely flawless. The two children provide very true to life performances. ESPECIALLY the little girl.
One final note: The main reason this movie was so good... and so scary... was the fact that it seemed so real. I'm not saying the aliens were real... so don't get me wrong. I'm saying that you begin to feel as if you are part of this family, trapped in this house, in a deathly situation... with no way out. Not only that, but you keep wondering how the movie is going to end. And when it does, the  reaction from the audience was: ""Oh, [...] I get it now!""",1031961600,4,1780,4.2976190476190474

1479114,4,B00005JL3T,"In ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" M. Night Shyamalan emphasized storytelling and mood and avoided unnecessary exposition. In ""Signs,"" he goes too far, such that the world of his story is not fully fleshed out and contains glaring holes.
To avoid spoilers, particularly those that give away its non-twist surprise ending (don't expect a ""why didn't I see that before?"" twist as in the other two films), ""Signs"" is about an alien invasion as seen through the eyes of Father Graham Hess, a farmer and former preacher who has lost his faith. The audience sees nothing which Father Hess and his family do not. This focus precludes scenes from such other invasion films as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""Independence Day"": the military response, the scientist's explanation of who the aliens are, what they want, and why they are here, etc. These scenes are not missed, and the imperspicuity helps the suspense. But there is vagueness in what we DO see. While advanced aliens could be susceptible to low-tech attacks, particularly if the higher beings lack brute strength, the aliens are portrayed as under-armed technologically. They seem more like pranking frat boys from outer space than a military invasion. Factual errors are also unexplained: the aliens' ships are said to all be ""within a mile"" of crop circles - yet they are hovering over downtown Mexico City!
Worse still is the incompleteness of the characters' world, both factually (er, which religion was Father Hess a reverend in?) and emotionally. Although Mel Gibson turns in one of his best performances, his character's emotional detachment damages the story. He has given up, so the audience has no reason to care until the end of the movie.
Alien and UFO enthusiasts will be disappointed. This is a film about higher themes than crop circles and extra-terrestrials. However, it made my heart pound in several scenes, and Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix as his brother Merrill are outstanding, so for first-time viewing, it works. Repeat viewings may not hold up as well.",1031875200,4,2045,5.035398230088496

If this wouldn't of happened and Shyamalan would of found a better way to end it, ""Signs"" would have been a much better movie. Besides the revealing of the face, where is the true horror? Yes, there was a couple of parts that made me jump, but it wasn't frightening enough. The comedy that was placed in the film didn't quite overwhelm it, but some of it wasn't necessary. I can understand completely that when some (or alot) of people went to see ""Signs"", they were hoping for a pure horror/drama with only a tiny bit of humor maybe here and there. So, the concept of the whole ""fun scary-type film"" got me kind of disappointed in the end. When I walked out of the theater I just said 'that wasn't at all like I hoped it would be'. The typical ending, the alien...the fact that it just wasn't frightening ENOUGH. Oh yes, the whole movie? Everything? It's not about the crop circles...it's not about the aliens...and no, it's not about the world coming to an end. If you really, and I mean seriously want to know, go see it (only if you're dying to know). It's not exactly that hard to notice.
For those of you who are wandering, I'm not just ragging on this movie because I have nothing better to do, I just wanted to get my point across. Now, not EVERYONE is gonna hate ""Signs"", but based on alot of these reviews and what my friends and people I know have been telling me (and what I thought of it), it wasn't very good.
So, alot of you who are expecting to see ""one of the greatest films"" or ""a great scary picture"", I'm only gonna say this......""it's not happening.""
Other than ""Signs"" I recommend some of these horrors and horror/dramas: ""Event Horizon"", ""Ginger Snaps"" and ""Resident Evil"".",1031875200,,1884,4.401146131805158
1479116,5,B00005JL3T,"This is a superlative movie on many levels, and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, proves that he is a force with which to be reckoned. After his blockbuster hit, ""The Sixth Sense', the viewing audience expected great things from him. When his next film, ""Unbreakable"", did not draw the raves that ""The Sixth Sense"" did, the viewing public anxiously awaited his next film to see if Shyamalan could, once again, hit it out of the ballpark. With ""Signs"", he confirms that he is, indeed, one of the directorial greats.
This film is about many things. It is about loss of a loved one. It is about family. It is about relationships. It is about things that we cannot control. It is about the inexplicable. It is about destiny. Yes, it is most certainly about alien invasion. It is also ultimately about one man's crisis of faith.
The film is a wonderful, scary, and amazing film. It centers around the Hess family, who has recently sustained the loss of Colleen Hess (Patricia Kalember) in a terrible accident one night. Wife to Graham (Mel Gibson), mother to Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and sister-in-law to Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), her death was felt on many levels. Graham, a minister in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was so distraught over the senseless (or so he thinks) death of his wife, that he left his ministry and is now living a purely secular life with their children and his brother, Merrill. Graham simply cannot understand why God has seemingly forsaken him. The death of his wife has divested him of his faith, and he finds himself struggling in the world without it.
One morning, Graham discovers crop circles in the cornfield in front of his house. Other strange things begin to happen, all while he is trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in a world that has suddenly changed in a way that he could never have envisioned. Worldwide, crop circles are mysteriously appearing, seemingly strategically, and, before one knows it, alien invaders are here. They are creepy. They are scary. They do not come in peace. The focus of the film is not so much on the alien invaders, however, but on how the family responds and interacts in this time of crisis.
There are some very frightening scenes in this film. They are all the more frightening for what one does not see rather than what one does see. There are some aspects of ""The Blair Witch Project"" at work here. Shyamalan certainly understands the concept that less is sometimes more and uses it to great effect. The effective use of tension by the director is one of the great strengths of this film. Sly, subtle humor is also used to great advantage. The other important component of the film is the acting.
There is not one bad performance in this film. Shyamalan, who normally gives himself a brief cameo in his own films, gave himself the part of Ray Reddy, the man who was the catalyst for the tragedy that enveloped the Hess household. He gives a more than credible performance. Abigail Breslin is simply delightful as little Bo, a child too young to fully comprehend what is going on around her, but who, nonetheless, reacts to its shifting permutations. Rory Culkin (yes, Macauley's younger brother in real life) gives a wonderfully intense performance as Bo's big brother. A somewhat singleminded child, he immediately becomes a believer in extraterrestrials and tries to gain an understanding on his own of what is to come.
It is Mel Gibson, however, along with Joaquin Phoenix, who ratchets up the ante. Mel Gibson gives a beautifully nuanced and sensitive performance, playing it totally straight with occasional flashes of humor. It is a performance of a conflicted man who cannot bear what has happened to him and does not reach an understanding until it is almost too late. In the end, he is able to see how some of what has happened to his family has had a semblance of a greater design. Even his wife's last words to him, so seemingly meaningless before, grow rich with meaning at the end.
Joaquin Phoenix is one of the younger generation's most talented actors. He infuses the role of Merrill with a vulnerability that is, at times, heartbreaking. Yet, somehow the viewer knows that the Hess family can count on him to be there for them one hundred percent. While he is not so conflicted as his brother Graham, however, he seems to need validation.
As the film barrels towards its climactic ending, scenes leading up to Colleen's last moments are woven throughout the film. This serves to show the viewer that the events of the present have meaning when grounded in the context of the past. It will come full circle in the end. This is a wonderful, beautiful, suspenseful, and scary film that is well worth seeing, and I eagerly await release of the DVD.",1031875200,91,4760,4.736144578313253

Manoj ""Night"" Shyamalan does wonderfully in his exposition, regardless of what others have let [drop] from gaping mouths.  The story is simple to follow, every scene is masterfully detailed and meticulously shot in the pure tradition of ""mise en scene.""

Mel Gibson's performance as a tortured spiritual leader and the ensuing tension in family and everyday life makes for one of the better roles I believe he's ever portrayed.  The dark style that has graced each of Shyamalan's previous films, which we are all familiar with, proves fresh yet again as we are invited to feel the same anxieties as those of the characters in the film, using true human emotion to convey character feelings as opposed to Hollywood glitz.  Those who concentrate on the short, minimalist section of CGI have forgotten, maybe they didn't even notice, that there is a story of human passion, spirituality, trust, fear and hope that precedes.  An A-list film.  I highly recommend it for those with a passion for TRUE cinema.",1031702400,,1226,4.777251184834123

1479181,3,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" opened after a massive publicity campaign, and the movie audiences had great expectations. Newsweek featured director M. Night Shyamalan on its cover, touting him as potentially the next Spielberg.
  The first half of the movie seem to qualify for its hype, as we are introduced to strange happenings and to the complex character, former Anglican priest (Mel Gibson) who has lost his faith after the sudden death of his wife.  He is left to raise his son and daughter alone, with the help of his younger brother, a failed minor league baseball player who has moved in with the bereaved family.  The juxtaposition of their routine life with the supernatural is intriguing.
  The second half of the movie fails to deliver, as we are introduced to glimpses of ""spacemen""  who look like a fourth grader's idea of interplanetary invaders.  There is one good, comic scene involving aluminum foil headgear.  Overall the remainder of the movie is disappointingly trite and unsatisfying.",1031443200,5,986,5.074534161490683
1479182,1,B00005JL3T,"You have to wonder what Shyamalan was thinking when he made this stinker. What we've got here is a really bad little green men film painfully stitched together with a really bad, completely insipid loss of faith film. From Mel Gibson's incredibly lame Episcopal priest to incredibly feeble aliens to cloyingly cute kiddos this is one long boring waste of time.
At this point I sort of wish Shyamalan had stopped after he'd made ""Sixth Sense."" It seems clear now he only had one good idea.",1031356800,4,488,4.686046511627907
1479183,2,B00005JL3T,"First, let me say that I understand the movie is not (primarily) ""about aliens"". The main theme of the movie is that, no matter how random the universe appears to be, there is a divine order to the chaos. The protagonist (Gibson) discovers this truth and is able to recover his lost faith as a result--no problem there. The movie also kept me on the edge of my seat in spots, although it moved a bit too slowly. That being said, the movie had two big problems. First, the Aliens. Can anyone tell me how a race smart enough to master interstellar travel can't (a) deal with simple obstacles like locked doors and (b) aren't smart enough to bring protection against common Earthly threats (such as baseball bats and water)? Were they were supposed to be idiot savants? Clearly Shyamalan was looking for some plot vehicle to be both threating and mysterious--the problem is that the Aliens didn't pass the credibility test. The other problem is that Shyamalan assumes the audience is too stupid to see the final revelation coming (e.g., everything is part of God's plan). In fact, one could see it coming a mile away. The same was true with the ""revelations"" in his other recent effort (Unbreakable). He's obviously trying recreate the briliant twist from the Sixth Sense ending. Unfortunately, he had yet to understand that he's lost both the advantage of surprise and the gift of subtlety.",1031356800,5,1388,4.763485477178423
1479184,5,B00005JL3T,"Mr. Shyamalan is brilliant and one of a kind. Thankfully, this is not a ""show me"" movie, but rather the ""camera angles"" feed the imagination, which can be more intense and frightening. The mood is created through the mind and not fancy-shmansy, in your face, special effects...This work is truely a breath of fresh air.
  This is not a typical sci-fi movie with aliens running amuck, laser guns, & ""rambo"" type heros.  The story has more depth to it than what is shown on the screen.  It does address crop circles (""They are either a hoax or they are real"") and an alien invasion, but he also addresses a family's struggle to get thru a tragic event together, which is non-alien related.  Could the aliens really represent those trials in life? They remain disguised in fields of thought and then at some point try to find a way in.  It appears that ""boarding up the windows"" will keep them out.  However, the answer may not be a complex solution, but rather something simple that is right in front.  Shyamalan's focus on the importance, strength, & support of family is to be commended. He shows us the unique quirks/characteristics of each of the family members and how life has brought them all together at that important time. A strong point in the movie is that there is no such thing as coincidence or irony.  A powerful & intriguing concept meant to be shared with the audience to ponder.
  This is a great movie full of meaning and insight.  Mel Gibson did a great job as always!  I was really impressed though with JOAQUIN PHOENIX's performance as Uncle Merrill.  He should win an award for this role.  His acting talent is truely amazing.  Wow! Joaquin has really mastered the art of getting into character.  You can see and feel the emotions in his facial expressions, voice, and body language that make Merrill come to life on the screen. He would have also been great way back during the silent film era for a good reason.  He is able to convey feelings with facial expressions alone.  He doesn't have to say a word and yet you know what the character is feeling. There are few actors in my mind that can do this.  Usually the words are first and then the emotion or the emotion is sudden to reflect the scene. With him the feeling is genuine & flows, you know what emotion is going on before the words ever come out.  True talent! What a brilliant actor!",1031356800,2,2368,4.524705882352941
1479185,4,B00005JL3T,"First of all I say read my review only because I've read so many reviews that give so much of the movie away.....and I'm not going to do that.  Like a trailer that shows you the whole movie, why see the movie afterwards?!  If you've seen Shyamalan's Sixth Sense or Unbreakable see Signs, enough said.  He doesn't disappoint.  Shyamalan has a remarkable imagination and I look forward to many endeavors from him in the years to come.  As for Signs....Mel Gibson is a widowed farmer, living with his two small children and brother, who discovers a crop circle in his corn field one day.  After that things start to get weird around his farm, with strange noises, unexplained movement, ""what's that"" kind of stuff.  And that should be enough to intrigue you.  So many reviews have given away too much information and I won't.  I went to see the movie blind with information and enjoyed it thoroughly.  If I had as much knowledge about it as some reviewers want to give out it would have ruined the experience for me.  I hope you enjoy the third of Shyamalan's many movies to come.  Look for him in the movie, he once again plays a role, though a much bigger one.  It's a fun ride, enjoy!!",1031356800,3,1185,4.481308411214953
1479186,2,B00005JL3T,"Watching this movie was just as much of a waist of time and money as making it. Filmmakers took unexplained events that actually took place in real life and explained them (very badly I should add).  But if you are under impression that this is a movie about crop circles as suggested by previews, you are mistaken.
Main storyline of this movie is religion. Mel Gibson's character (who used to be a reverent) looses his faith in God after the death of his wife. Throughout the course of the movie he obviously gains it back. Aliens were simply added as a secondary story to privet the movie from ""GOD"" label.
As disappointing as that was, the Alien portion of this movie was almost laughable. The explanation for crop circles provided by this movie was Aliens (I've mentioned them couple of times by now). These visitors are hostile and use crop circles as a guide for landing. What's amazing is that life forms so advanced to travel thousands of light years to kill us happened to have impossible time handling locked doors, can be bitten by a baseball bat and killed by splashing water at them. I DON'T THINK SO. I know it's fiction, but it did not have to be this ridiculous.
On the positive note, there were two parts in this movie that actually were pretty suspenseful, but they lasted only 3 min total (which is the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1) and did not provide enough distraction from how bad the movie was.

Let me just say that this is my favorite scary movie that I've ever seen in my life, that doesn't neccessarily mean that its the scariest, but it is the most enjoyable and watchable.  I've seen it three times, and I liked it even more each time.  It is an excellent film, with awesome acting, some very funny moments, some very frightening moments, and also very touching.  Its from the writer/director of ""The Sixth Sense"", M. Night Shyamalan,who delievers yet another great film (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" are also his work, and worth seeing).  ""Signs"" is hardly about crop circles, more so about aliens, but its mostly about the journey of a man's faith.

Unlike awkward attempts fusion like Contact and just down right mutual insults like science fiction speculation that one saint or another was actually an alien, Signs harmoniously brings together these elements with a sense of synergy and wonder.
Gibson and Phoenix do an excellent job as brothers with contrary view points. We see Gibson's character, who has lost hope due to a recent tragedy, and Phoenix who's character tries at every opportunity to do something better and be something better - even when there really isn't an opportunity.
One of the major strengths of this film is it keeps everything on a personal level. The world view is something different and remote, especially when the threat is so very close to home.

While trying to raise his kids with the help of his younger brother, a failed baseball player, aliens show up in the middle of his cornfield and make big crop circles while stalking his house.  The brilliance of the director was in taking such a wacky premise and making it into a good movie anyway.  The film is heavy on suspense, with most of the terror implied or barely shown, which is another huge plus in my mind.  Gibson does a great job portraying the main character, and the child actor and actress are superb; Phoenix is OK in his role.

Mel Gibson plays a Pennsylavia preacher who lost his wife and opts to becoome a farmer.  One morning, he, his brother (Juaquin Phoenix), and his children discover crop signs in their corn.  The next day, they find that nearly 20 crop signs have been found in England, India, and several other countries.
As the story unfolds, each member of the family reveals his or her quirks and shortcomings.  Gibson's character, through three dream sequences, reveals the stunning circumstances under which he lost his wife (and his faith).
Eventually, we find that there are in fact aliens (which admitedly do look very B-movie-esque) who may or may not be planning on invading the earth.  It is at this point that Shyamalan's brilliance truly shows.  Gibson and Phoenix discuss, while watching the shocking news, the different types of people in the world:  Group one, the people who think of things as chance or circumstance; and Group two, those who believe in miracles.
In Shyamalan's previous films, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" the endings were sharp, swift, jaw dropping events.  In ""Signs,"" however, the ending, one of the most beautiful endings I have ever seen, brings everything else in the film together, revealing the true miracle that is life.",1030752000,,1454,4.958847736625515

While ""Signs"" lacks the perfect sheen and momentum of ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is also less diffuse and more moving than ""Unbreakable."" In telling the story of a disillusioned minister and his family threatened by alien invasion, Shyamalan borrows here and there--a pinch of Spielberg, a dash of Hitchcock, a hint of George Romero--but melds the film into something unmistakably his own. There are moments here as terrifying as any in cinematic history, all the more so because they leave the worst to the audience's imagination. The dictum ""Less is more"" applies to horror movies as much as anything, and Shyamalan understands that better than anybody. Above all, Shyamalan understands the overriding importance of spirituality in human lives--that the religious sense is, indeed, an essential part of our humanity, perhaps THE essential part. It is the spiritual theme in ""Signs"" that lifts it above the usual run of horror flicks, and also makes the wordless final scene one of the most satisfying in recent memory. Shyamalan of course is also an excellent director of actors; Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones and the two child actors give quiet yet deeply moving performances. It's too bad, then, that Shyamalan couldn't finesse the plot holes better--isn't it convenient, for example, that Gibson's son finds a book that tells the family everything it needs to know about the aliens?

Even the true meaning of the title only becomes clear as the movie unfolds. Suffice it to say that the alien markings in his Pennsylvania cornfield are not the most crucial signs in the family life that Mel Gibson is trying to rebuild following the tragic accident that killed his wife and caused him to resign from the ministry and lose his faith. Most of the limited violence and bloodshed is suggestive, but nevertheless psychologically disturbing, especically for younger children. I enjoyed it much more the second time, when the shock value of these scenes had worn off and I could pick up the all the nuances and implications which I had not caught when I first saw it because I was so involved in the action and the story line.

The aliens are extra and are like the vehicle that is sold separately.  You don't need the aliens to enjoy the figurines.  That's what this movie is like.  At the core, and forgive me if this sounds cheesy but, this film is about finding faith.  It's cliche, and I'll tell you what worked and didn't work.
The actors all did a wonderful job in their roles, but it's the story itself that is suspect.  I believe this story would've been just as effective had the writer thrown in a hurricane or some other natural disaster in place of the aliens.  I mean, think about it.  You have a guy who loses his faith, and at one of the critical moments in the film where he's locked away in a basement with his family, he pleads to god for his son's life and subsequently regains his faith.  Personally, I think the aliens were tossed in to generate intrigue for the film, as well as to tap in the X-File fans.  But when all is said and done, the aliens weren't that crucial to begin with when you consider what the writer used as the alien's kryptonite.  ""High quality H2O"" in the words of Adam Sandler in the Waterboy.  They were completely dispensible, and easily at that.  They left in a hurry and that was the end of the story.  Geez, put a little more thought into it, will ya?
On a brigher note, I think the director did a great job of building suspense and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats at key moments.  He also got the dry, subtle humor down.  But for most of the film, it was slow and kind of boring (even according to a guy who loved the film).  So ""Yay"" for the directing and acting, ""Boo"" for the story.
I can, however, recommend this as a family film.

1479320,4,B00005JL3T,"Most people (at least I feel that way) consider ""Sixth Sense"" to be the standard by which all M. Night Shyamalan movies should be measured. If that is the case, then ""Unbreakable"" was terrible and ""Signs"" is... well, just different. But it's different in more than one sense: on one side it seems like a really low budget movie (with not too many performers, not too many locations and not too many special effects for an alien movie -at least for Hollywood's standard for alien movies).
Stop! That's another thing: most people have said ""Signs"" is about aliens. Well, I found the movie to be more about loosing faith and regaining it, and the alien thing to be just the background for this, the real theme of the movie. It can be argued that the topic could have been touched in a different way, but I still liked it: I thought it was dealt with in a way that combined in a pretty unique way suspense (M. Night Shyamalan's tademark) with a LOT of humor... something you normally wouldn't expect neither in a movie of his nor in an ""alien"" movie (more to the point). As for performances, the kids were very good, and so was Mel Gibson but Joaquin Phoenix proved once more what an awesome actor he can be. Way to go, Joaquin!",1030406400,5,1224,4.444444444444445

The suspense of this movie comes not from millions of dollars of special effects, but simply from Mr. Shyamalan's talent for tapping into one's imagination to bring them to the edge of their seat.  It has been a long time since I found myself peaking out of the slits between my fingers while watching a film.  However, this film would not be a pleasant experience for anybody who has forgotten what open minded means or for those with no creative imagination.",1030320000,3,591,4.453703703703703

I saw this movie this weekend at a Matinee ...and it started just like all of his other movies... Interesting beginning, slow moving revealations, a cameo by the Director so on and so forth (although his role in this movie is much more involved).
I was left ""wanting"", ""waiting"" for more......... I agree with several other reviewers there are some very funny moments in this and it truly inspirational for someone that may ask the question to themselves as to where is your FAITH? I could have seen this movie with less acclaimed actors in it and it would have done just about the same. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix hmmmm I really enjoy their acting but I feel as if there wasn't much for them to do with this script. I won't give spoilers but they give so much away in this movie and the fact that they chose to stay in the house and fight it out made ABSOLUTELY no sense to me. The ending was anticlimatic as well so I really hope his next movies carries through with the build up that he starts with because my goodness they seem to promise SO MUCH more at the beginning and then just gets deflated along the way.

The bad reviews that have been given here show a lack of understanding and maturity on the part of the reviewers.  Yes, this movie is NOT about aliens, it is NOT about crop circles, it is NOT a science fiction or horror flick.  These elements of the film were only vehicles for the themes of family, strength in trial, the loss and regaining of faith.  There are no holes in this film-- as in Shyamalan's other films, everything falls together at the end -- everything.  I found the ending perfectly satisfying -- the tensions and problems of the plot were resolved, and Shyamalan didn't even have to resort to hundreds of planes attacking giant saucers to get his points across.

1479324,4,B00005JL3T,"This movie is not a big budget alien invasion thriller that some may have made it out to be.  I will admit that the marketing of this movie did make it seem like the audience would see Sci-Fi thriller.  It is a thriller and there are aliens; however, the aliens are used more like plot devices than the plot itself.  The real story is about a man dealing with the loss of his wife, and the effects that it has had on his family.
Mel Gibson?s character is remarkably acted and very believable.  Gibson plays a Priest who has fallen away from his faith because of the unbelievable circumstances in which his wife perished (you must see the movie to fully understand the circumstances of her death).  He and his children and his brother (who looks like he is actually related to Gibson; excellent casting) live on a small Pennsylvania farm.  The movie starts out with the discovery of a crop circle in thier field.  At first the circle is dismissed as a fabrication.  However, as more and more crop circles appear around the world it becomes eerily apparent that this is more than a simple hoax.  This is where the Sci-fi element comes into play.  The side-story is one of an alien invasion, however, it is told exclusively from the point of view of this small and troubled Pennsylvanian family. Most of the Alien invasion is conveyed by way of the television set that the Family owns. This may seem silly, but one of the film?s most shocking scenes comes when Gibson?s brother is watching a news report clip that features one of the alien bad guys (by far my favorite scene, very scary).  Some people may rebuke Shyamalan for taking this somewhat simplistic approach to a Sci-Fi thriller, however, I found that it gave the film a much more real world feel. Overall, telling the story from the Family's point of view made the Alien Invasion element much more spooky, overwhelming, and realistic.
The movie goes on and tells the story of a troubled family that must come together in a time of fear and uncertainty.  The movie ends with one of  Shyamalan?s trade mark twist endings.  You will learn that the movie?s title ?Signs? has an entirely different meaning other than crop circles.
Oh, and did I mention that this movies is rather humorous. Its humor wouldn?t work in say... ?The Sixth Sense?, but here it enhances the mood of the film ( it would have been too drab without it).",1030233600,2,2380,4.5825471698113205

They awake to the sound of Bo Hess screaming in the corn feild. It then becomes aware that a crop circle has been made. Was it done by man or something larger?

1479326,2,B00005JL3T,"This film wasn't the Sixth Sense and please don't expect it to be but for a movie I paid money to see, I expected a little more than an overwrought sermon about how events that seem related happen for a greater reason. I personally don't believe in that tripe, but if you do that's fine. I would've liked to have seen an actual alien invasion take place as the movie towards the end was driving towards but we ended following along with how the characters reacted to the attempted invasion.
The movie was in a way not about aliens. It was about a priest losing his faith and regaining thanks to some wierd loner running into his wife and these big green naked aliens who for some strange reasons what humans as a food supply.  But the overall message is to not lose faith but if you didn't get that message when the movie first started then you might just clinically brain dead, I mean it's that obvious.
Here's a thought...Since when do people go to the movies to be preached to by some big shot director who has millions of dollars, who doesn't have a care in the world, about faith? This guy and I can't spell his name, but this director wants to mystify people with his films, when this film comes off as an insult to human intelligence.

1479327,5,B00005JL3T,"So I get on here to look at how people have reviewed this movie.  All the reviews I see just from the first click to the page were 2 stars?!?  People trying to compare this to The Sixth Sense?  What?  This movie hit all it's marks in getting you scared when you're supposed to be, even throws in a little chuckle moment, but in no way did I feel this to be a B-movie.
M. Night has pretty much made up for his short comings in Unbreakable.  Which if anything, Unbreakable should have been the Sixth Sense comparison.  It was a soft movie and didn't give a very intense conclusion.  Signs on the other hand did very well in giving a sense of fear and making you ask the question throughout the movie ""Is this just some pranks, or is it real?""
Mel Gibson did a nice job playing a naive ex-clergyman.  Just have to chuckle at the townspeople still seeing him as a man of the cloth when he prefers not to do anything related.  Swearing?  Oops!  Listening to a confession of an upset girl, but yet tells his family, ""I just want you to stay away from her.""  A bit of logistics that probably flew by, but could be explained.
Then there's this back story that you get introduced to about what happened to his wife that made him loose faith in being a clergyman.  A clansman of the Culkin clan,little brother to Macaulay who plays his son with asthesma, daughter who drinks a sip of water from a glass, then leaves the glass someplace to get another drink of water, only to leave the glass where others are.  Joaquin Phoenix plays the brother, who at times is comic relief himself, has his own past to deal with.
In all, the movie played out well, I think M. Night did it again in hitting all the marks of making a movie entertaining, scary, fun, silly, and moving.  There's only going to be one Sixth Sense.  Signs is the next one in line that there can't be anything as powerful as it brings to the audience.  There's no doubt about it, this movie rocks.  I saw it at the first showing, 11:30am.

1479329,5,B00005JL3T,"Having come up with a massive hit with THE SIXTH SENSE and then taken a few steps back with the bland UNBREAKABLE, writer/producer/director M. Nyght Shayamalan has re-emerged with a winning science fiction/suspense film in SIGNS.
Mel Gibson stars as a priest in rural Pennsylvania who, because of the loss of his wife, has lost his faith and quit the church.  But when crop circles appear in his cornfield, his sheltered life with his children and his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) takes a weird turn.  As they continue to watch TV, they hear of more crop circles turning up all over the world until finally strange lights are spotted in the night skies over Mexico.  Gibson becomes more and more unglued and paranoid; and in the ensuing siege on his house, he must regain his faith to survive.
Although it is still too early in the game to consider Shayamalan ""the next Spielberg"" (especially when the REAL Spielberg is still making superlative movies himself), SIGNS does show some of the Spielberg touches--suspense, shock effects, ordinary people and extraordinary circumstances.  Gibson gives one of his best performances as the priest whose confrontations with the alien forces see him regaining his faith but nearly losing his mind in a wash of paranoia.  As was the case in THE SIXTH SENSE, Shayamalan leaves little clues for the audience to follow as to how the story will eventually come out.  Shayamalan also pulls a Hitchcock by making his own cameo appearance as a local neighbor with a slightly sinister look.
Although probably not quite the masterpiece that THE SIXTH SENSE had been, SIGNS is nevertheless suspenseful sci-fi entertainment, scary at times but never jaw-droppingly violent.  James Newton Howard's score occasionally echoes his score for THE SIXTH SENSE but even shows the influences of Stravinsky and Bernard Herrmann.  It is a very good film, and comes highly recommended.",1030147200,,1907,5.0702875399361025

1479373,1,B00005JL3T,"I hate when writers try to change a genre to fit their interpretation of how things should be. Or, let me put that another way, I hate it when writers try to change a genre to fit their interpretation of how things should be and do a horrible job of it. Personally, if someone wants to break new ground, I'm all for it, that's how we learn and discover new things. But M. Night Shyamalan doesn't do any of that, instead he paints himself into a corner in his current film, ""Signs"" starring Mel Gibson as a disenchanted priest/father/minister of some unknown religion trying to save his family from an alien invasion. The 'aliens' can apparently navigate across hundreds of parsecs of space to find planet Earth, but then need to place crop circles as directional and positional locators. And apparently Bucks County PA is of such import to them that they place crop circles in Mel Gibson's back forty. The aliens, despite all their advanced technology, can get locked in a pantry.
Firstly, it doesn't know what it is. It's not a horror film, because it isn't all that scary, suspenseful or even thrilling. It isn't science fiction, because Shyamalan insists on telling an alien invasion story from a microcosmic view point that never extends more than a mile or two from the Hess farm where the 'action', if I may use that term here, takes place. The only views of the rest of the world we get are from painfully stiff and fake-seeming news reports of alien ships around the world. This movie has no style, and someone ought to tell Mr. Shyamalan that there exists within the movie business numerous devices other than tripods and cranes with which to hold a camera. Either the camera is static, panning back and forth or rising above the action. There are no tracks, dollies, gimbals or anything that conveys motion, everything in the film seems to be a set-piece event with only a camera to bear witness to it. Everything in this film, characters, events, are so stiff that emotions are stifled if not smothered outright. No one reacts to anything in any consistent fashion. Worse, people's reactions to serious events are so skewed, that it quickly became unconvincing.
The most noticeable examples of this are when we learn that the aliens' presence is making animals a little nutty, supposedly the way they act when a predator is nearby and one of the Hess family Shepherds lunges at Mel's daughter. The son kills the dog (off camera) with a big barbecue fork to the throat and when Mel and the sheriff arrive on the scene, the son is staring blankly, the daughter is sitting on her swing set staring blankly, with only a few mute tears between them. Mel and the sheriff stare blankly at the dead animal. However, when Mel decides to put it to a vote as to whether the family should head for the lake or stay in the farm house, the son freaks when Mel states that because he represents 2 parents that he gets two votes.
There is no tension in this film. All we need to know, apparently, we learn from the son who reads ONE book on ETs and suddenly has them all figured out. And if he doesn't know it, the TV reveals everything else. If it's an invasion, he says, they won't use their advanced because we'll nuke the planet making it useless to them. They'll fight 'hand to hand' to prevent this, there seems to be no middle ground here. When it's revealed on the news that the aliens leave just as quickly as they arrived, the kid figures out that it's a raid and they're just harvesting humans. The crop circles themselves are map coordinates and while Washington and New York are major sites, so is Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
The worst aspect of the film is Gibson's character. Apart from being stiff, he plays a priest/reverend/father who lost his faith when his wife died 6 months previous. But when his son doesn't die from an alien gas attack because he was having an asthma attack and didn't breath it, he suddenly finds it again, as if it were hidden behind the couch all along. Second, exactly WHICH Christian faith did he belong to? He dressed as a Catholic priest and took a confession in a drug store, yet he can't be Catholic, because he was married.
Mostly though, this movie was just plain boring. I was never once on the 'edge of my seat' as so many people and the advertisements claim, and it isn't because I am so jaded a movie goer that 'Signs' just didn't reach me. I cried when Sully said good-bye to Boo in 'Monsters, Inc.' so I know it's not that. There is no suspense, no real imperilment of the family, only family pets left to die at the hands of the alien invaders. You can't makes these kinds of films in a microcosm, because there is just too much else to consider. It bored me, it really did, and I know Shyamalan can do better, because he had my undivided attention in 'The Sixth Sense', so why not this one? Because it's really that bad.",1030147200,8,4875,4.528344671201814
1479374,3,B00005JL3T,"I expected a lot more out of this movie, the trailer really hinted at more. Instead of seeing a creepy movie I watched a movie about a man dealing with emotions, and the occasional alien. It just didn't add up for me.
The movie really drags on; you spend most of the movie watching the crop circles and delving into the family history. You find out that the father (A former pastor) lost his faith in God after his wife was killed by a neighbour who fell asleep at the wheel. He's now trying to raise his two children with the help of his younger brother, who once played for the minor leagues, but had the highest strike out record. Here are the four of them, living in a small house on a corn farm, trying to patch together their lives. Then the crop circles came.
For a movie that was hyped as much as it was, the special effects didn't live up to the promises.  The spaceships that appear in the sky are glowing lights, no definition, no close ups, just small spots of light.  You only get two good shots of the alien, along with a couple shots of their hands. They look like a stereotypical alien, tall, slender with long limbs and an oval head. At least they could have made them look more interesting.
Overall, the film is a disappointment, I think there were a lot of things that could have been left out. The biggest one to me was the death of the wife. You keep seeing minor flashbacks throughout the movie, which eventually play out completely and help save one of the children from an alien, but they don't add anything to the movie. Mel Gibson is a good enough actor to be able to portray his loss of faith and anger without a bunch of flashback scenes. I also feel the last 10 minutes or so of the movie could be cut off, the only purpose they showed was how the family could unite together and start healing. It's a nice thought, but since the movie was hyped to be about aliens invading earth, the family plot just seems to make the movie drag on.",1030060800,2,1963,4.274193548387097

1479378,4,B00005JL3T,"Gibson plays Graham Hess, a recently widowed minister and father of two who has been bled not only of joy and charm but also of his faith. His baby brother Merrill (Phoenix), a washed-up minor league ballplayer, has moved into the guesthouse on Hess's farm in rural Pennsylvania. Hess's two grade-school age children are grappling with their mother's death and their father's emotional demise. They also deal with asthma and obsessive habits.
Into this mix plop ominous harbingers: crop markings, mysterious figures in the shadows, and pets going mad. These signs pecede an alien invasion.
But this ain't ""Independence Day,"" folks. ""Signs"" is about fragile human life and about faith.
The story unfolds strictly from the Hess family's perspective. There are no scenes in the Penatgon or the White House, nor are there shots of spaceships rumbling toward Earth or cities being leveled. You experience the invasion as the typical family boarded up in their country home in the middle of the night would. Every sound is suspect and every choice is life-or-death.
Gibson is a morose and timid anti-Mel in this film, devoid of charm or animation (light years from Martin Riggs or William Wallace). That's interesting to me but not to some. The lingering camera shots of silent characters (or inanimate objects) are real-time, character's-point-of-view devices that can allow the audience to project their fears onto the film. But they can be seen as plodding and obtuse, too.
The weakest device is the alien invasion itself. It's ""facts"" are rife with illogic. In wedding the genres of his first two films (the supernatural of ""Sixth Sense"" and the pulp/comicbook premise of ""Unbreakable"") Shyamalan was shooting for a unique type of film. In some ways he succeeds. But the invasion story is thin because it's expendable. Cardinal rule: If a story doesn't need aliens to be told, why have them? In fact, its spiritual aspect would be all the more resonant in normal life. But then it wouldn't be a Shyamalan movie, would it?

Usually directors get caught up in the special effects or the action, and don't pay attention to what is most important: the reactions of the characters and the effect such a shocking event would have on their community. So, even though M. Night Shyamalan's Signs has significant flaws, it deserves credit for approaching the whole ""alien invaders"" thing in, for the most part, an original, clever, and entertaining way.
In Signs, a mid-western family, consisting of a former priest and widower (Mel Gibson), his children and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix), is faced with mysterious occurances and then an actual alien invasion. As stated previously, Signs really isn't about the actual alien invasion, for few details about the aliens are provided and the only coverage of their attack on the world comes through the family's TV set. Instead, it's about peoples' reactions to the unknown and mysterious. Consequently, some people, especially those people who walk in expecting some slam-bang action/horror spectacle, may be disappointed.
This, however, is unfortunate, because Signs really does have many admirable qualities. Its highlights include a terrific soundtrack (reminicent of Hitchcock's soundtrack for Psycho) and good performances from the actors. As for the directing, it is somewhat uneven. Although Shyamalan is clearly able to generate good ""Hitchcock-esque"" suspense and does have an ability for capturing the small details that create the atmosphere, he does sometimes become a little heavy-handed. The script is also uneven - it has patches of humor and genuine insight into the characters - but also often falls short and resorts to Hollywood cliches which make the characters seem shallow.
Overall, however, Signs is quite good. Its biggest flaws are its message about spirituality, which is overly stressed, and the fact that the script sometimes becomes corny. Nevertheless, among the many junky summer blockbusters, Signs is one movie that is worth seeing regardless of its flaws, as its original take on the alien invasion idea and its creepy atmosphere, which keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, make it well worth the money.",1030060800,4,2245,5.326760563380281

Alas, this movie disappoints like a kid's cereal box. It smothers its viewers in tense dialogue, end of the world fears, always promising something more, & ultimately failing to deliver any substance. Actually, the greatest strength of this movie is that it is so ridiculous that none of it is believable emotions without reason. At the end I waited for Mel to wake up & find out the whole movie was just a dream experienced in some kind of coma.
The movie use clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;-- a man who has lost his faith and needs redemption, an asthmatic child, faith over fear, trust don't question, & incredibly stupid aliens-- with weaknesses stolen from old B sci-fi movies.

There were more funny (funny stupid, not funny haha) moments in this movie than scary ones, and I was never ""on the edge of my seat.""

I watched thinking ok it's trundling along, it's going to get going in a minute, it's warming up etc. It seemed to have a lot of promise. Then the ending (which I won't tell you as you'll work it out for yourself) happened and the titles came up and you know what? It was that total bar steward of a director M. Night Shymalan. I didn't realise before the film but I certainly recognised this was his piece of work.
All of his films start with great promise, interesting storylines and top actors and they all infer this is going to be a great solid film. Then they end without fulfilling any of their promise. I saw the twist in the Sixth Sense within 25 mins of it starting (and I did not even realise there was a twist before I went to see the film!)and Unbreakable started well until the twist at the end which I nearly walked out on as my god what was he thinking - did no-one tell him this was a diabolical ending.
I think if he could finish a film as well as he does the start of his films he will be a really good director. But he needs sooooo badly to work on the ending of his films.

Gibson plays a preacher-turned-athiest when his wife gets crushed by a car, living in a hick-like-town he supports his two young children and his younger brother. after numerous reports of crop circles and one right in his front yard, the news media announces that aliens have invaded the world and they're not here to use the telephone. the film is bombarded with flashbacks of how/why he lost his faith, in an attempt to make you teary-eyed and is soaked with those dreaded 'oscar-moments'. the only thing more pathetic than seeing Mel Gibson cry is watching two white, middle aged business men high-fiving eachother in front of the gap. The result is a film that sags between its night sequences.

There is no reason that this movie should have been produced for more than five million dollars. The techniques Shaymalan uses can be summed up in two words: Film School. Showing only one alien, no spaceships, no worldwide alien water dippings, and the ultimate, casting yourself, the writer/director in the movie as one of the more significant players, are all examples of what we in film school like to call ""lack of funds"". It is a shame that such a hollow, insignificant and teasing movie, (crop circles have virtually nothing to do with it)can be made. Shayamalan is finished as a writer.

but I have been blown away reading the glowing praise.
The next Spielberg? You've got to be kidding me. The
writer/director made a great first hit movie (""The Sixth
Sense""), for sure. ""Signs"" is not only not a very
good movie, but the script uses potentially interesting
and inspiring themes like crop circles and ET's and totally
trivializes them, and I'd say in fact uses them in a most
disingenuous, uncreative way to bring in the bucks by
drawing in viewers, who see an utterly banal movie that
covers absolutely no new ground.
  I've read a number of books, seen videos, etc. on the
aforementioned subjects over many years, and when I heard about
""Signs,"" by the creator of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I expected at
least some attempt to shed some light on what is really happening.
Parenthetically I find the assertions by ""scientists"" that all
crop circles are hoaxes to be nonsense. Shyamalan could have
made an interesting drama about how the crop circles are being
created, and might have shown how indeed some of them could be
hoaxed. He could have created some intriguing interactions between
aliens and the characters played by Mel Gibson and his family, and
indeed the talent was there had he so chosen.
  What we get is none of these, but rather a cheap rehash
of the ""aliens are bad"" theme, and a so-called ""scary"" movie
where the aliens are really nothing more than monsters we've
already seen in countless movies. Further, neither the alien nor
the crop circle themes as portrayed in ""Signs"" are even believable.
Crop circles are always found in wheat fields, but of course for
dramatic effect here they are in corn fields, allowing better
""action."" And does anyone question the absurdity of beings
intelligent enough to create incredibly elaborate, mathematically
amazing patterns which do practically no damage to the crops, turning
out to be non-speaking ghouls who want to strangle humans with
their bare hands?! Or how about the ridiculous scenes in this
""scary"" movie where the actors are reading the only book on ET's
in the small town they live in, while wearing primitive aluminum
triangular hats?
  We're also going to have to coin a new term for the kind of
close-up Shyamalan gives us countless times in ""Signs."" I'd call
it the ""in your face"" technique. We see almost nothing of the actor
but his/her eyes, and maybe a little nose! That instead of some
meaningful dialogue and dramatic tension, almost wholely missing
here.
  The only bright light in ""Signs"" is the performance of
the very young actress who plays Gibsons' daughter. It is a
shame that so much talent is wasted in ""Signs,"" and I'd bet
that there are many unknown movie makers who could cover
the topics presently so poorly here incomparably better.",1029628800,4,2791,4.824267782426778

I even swallowed the spirituality aspect, something I normally detest. It was fine here, perhaps because it could be interpreted as pertaining to one isolated family and not the whole world.
Signs. Coincidences. Tragedies and miracles. The miracle is that in life grace can come from terrible events as often as from wonderful things. I don't want to give away too much of the story but essentially it's about one family's fear and confusion while the rest of the world confronts something extraordinary and sinister. It's beautifully set up, leisurely paced. I didn't want it to end, and I didn't want to leave the theater. The farm and family felt like my in-laws, the house is not unlike mine. It's familiar and comforting. (Well, except that I have the same attic door, and the same coal chute and the same junk in the basement...not so comforting!) The outside world is kept at bay. The threat is not shown until the end, but that also means no glib analysis is forthcoming, no method of coping with it ready to hand. In real life we aren't privy to top secret military tactics as we usually are in movies, and especially in alien invasion movies. Here we can only wait with the people who don't know what's happening to their lives, to their world, to their reality.
It's got soft humor, lots of suspense, a scene that had me sobbing and blowing my nose loudly, lapses of logic but who cares, and a scene that scared dignified ole me into a dignified shriek.

This is the kind of movie Hitchcock himself would be making were he alive today.  Like Psycho, which wasn't really about its star actress Janet Leigh, Signs is less about crop circles than audiences expect.
The suspense is masterfully handled - diametrically opposed to most other films today - and a welcome relief from their guts and gore.  The shots are beautiful, the actors exceptional.  The child actors give phenomenal, realistic performances.
By always maintaining focus on the characters, and raising serious questions of fate and faith, Signs defies the label of science fiction.  Because it shuns so many conventional elements of film (graphic violence, sound bites created solely for trailers, extraneous special effects) Signs is a movie well worth watching again and again.",1029542400,2,913,5.268965517241379

1479486,4,B00005JL3T,"""Unbreakable"" was an ultra-serious comic book movie that may have been too morose for most. As a comic book fan, I fell in love with it (and the director's filmmaking style). ""Signs"" is an edge-of-your-seat drama that may have been too farfetched or ""preachy"" for some. It's the most fun I've had in years! Admittedly, M. Night Shyamalan's directing skills far surpass his storytelling skills, but the young writer/director again proves with his latest blockbuster that he is a filmmaker to be contended with.
First let me say there were two things that surprised me about this film:
1) There is NO SURPRISE TWIST. There is, admittedly, a REVELATION of sorts, but it's not nearly in the same capacity as his last two films. So don't set yourself up for disappointment and miss a well-made film despite (or because of) the lack of a huge twist.
2) There is a lot more humor than I expected. Almost to the point of being distracting. ALMOST. ""Signs"" is essentially a family drama and the dynamics between the characters are extremely amusing.
Despite the humor, the tension is almost unbearable at times. I don't recall being this nervous since ""Silence of the Lambs."" It's truly amazing how Shyamalan shifts between the two poles of comic relief and terror with such precision and effectiveness.
A word of warning, like all of his other films, ""Signs"" walks a very fine line between surrealism and silliness. Depending on what you expected and what kind of mood you were in, you'll end up loving the film or despising it. There is no middle ground, because Shyamalan leaves no such choice at the end of the film. I've come to realize that you need a particular mindset when you enter a Shyamalan movie: namely, forget what you think you know about what you're going to watch. It's probably not true. Expectations and assumptions are key.
Shyamalan's direction has been panned by some critics as being ""pretentious."" I can't disagree more. ""Unbreakable"" may have been pretentious, but ""Signs"" is subtle and understated. The camera never brings attention to itself because story and character require the complete attention of the audience. His writing is excellent, though there are several elements that can be considered ""plot holes."" Dialogue is a little silly but highly effective and, excluding a few anti-mind-reading tin-foil hats, it is the sole reason for the film's humor. Needless to say, Shyamalan's story development is in perfect sync with his visual storytelling.
The music is SUPERB. It is one of the most effective scores I've ever heard. And the sound effects are extremely creepy. The resulting mood that is set with the music and sound is highly reminiscent of Bill Paxton's ""Frailty."" But while Paxton's inexperience is evident in his debut film, Shyamalan shows himself to be on top of his game.
As for the acting, it is very good overall. Note that there are basically only 4 characters who make up the whole picture. Mel Gibson takes on most of the acting burden, and, as an actor who doesn't have the greatest range, he is his usual star self. Not his best work but good enough. The two child actors are charming and well-cast, but a bit too heavy-handed in their precociousness. In fact, they play their characters with such weirdness that I was expecting one or both of them to be revealed as aliens. Thankfully, such is not the case, cause that would've been way too creepy. Finally we have Joaquin Phoenix who totally steals the movie. Gibson's dry wit scores some chuckles and the kids have their occasional funny lines but Phoenix bats a thousand in all his scenes (sorry, couldn't help myself). He was born to play this part. One of the best scenes he has is the ""I'm a miracle man"" story.
As much as I like it, there are four reasons why I'm not giving this film a perfect grade:
1) With all the excitement and tension that is built up in the last 20-30 minutes, the climax does not completely satisfy. ""Swing away Merrill"" was a nice touch, though.
2) The aspect of the ending dealing with Gibson's faith was appropriate, but it was too pat and simple and abrupt. It needed a little more development.
3) This opening and closing title sequences are extremely ugly and unnecessarily HUGE. I can live with them since they're homages to Hitchcock but I will never like them.
4) SPOILER: For a being who is super fast and fairly strong, the alien in the final scene did nothing to fight back. He just stood there waiting to be hit.
All in all, scarier than ""Panic Room,"" superior to ""Frailty,"" and funnier than any thriller I've ever seen, ""Signs"" is the best film of the summer so far. As my friend predicted before the show started, ""Shyamalan delivers.""",1029542400,13,4684,4.762607626076261
1479487,2,B00005JL3T,"I was disappointed in this movie, but, then, I am not sure what I was expecting unless it was simply this - a better story.  The clue to the identity of the plot lies in the meaning of what, in this story, the word ""sign"" means.

The acting is almost good.  But I did get weary with the camera angles and dark shots.  Gibson is sometimes stoic, sometimes cheerful, and sometimes morbid as the self - defrocked minister who does not want to be called 'Father.""  He has lost his wife in a terrible accident six months before.  Actually the flashbacks (intersperced throughout)  of his coming upon the accident scene are the most interesting part of the movie. And for a few seconds the cute little girl who plays his daughter draws our attention.  Joaquin Phoenix's  character is actually good and heroic,  but that is  not to say he is quite ready for romantic leads yet nor is he Spiderman material.

All and all the story just didn't flow.  We are so concerned with where it may be going that we become confused and lose our way in the process.  And I must admit that I wasn't scared, not once.

1479557,4,B00005JL3T,M. Night Shyamalan has yet to disappoint me with his skill at crafting films.  SIGNS is an alien movie that is ultimately not about aliens.  I enjoyed it immensely.

1479558,5,B00005JL3T,"I saw ""Signs"" three days after it released and I must say it was certainly a very interesting and suspenseful movie. I have to disagree with many people trying to compare Shyamalan to Spielberg; I mean, hello! just because a movie has a different intriguing storyline doesn't mean that people should think that the director is like a Spielberg wannabe, because everyone has their own unique way of making movies, so there shouldn't be any comparisons unless the storyline is 100% exactly similar between the two movies. Anyway, I wouldn't say that the storyline is a completly original one because there have been other movies like this..but the way M.Night Shyamalan has portrayed the storyline with the increasing depth and the relationship between the characters is excellent, and because of that, it is a must watch! True, it is not as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", it is much much better than the unbearable ""Unbreakable"".
The story is about Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who lost his faith in God ever since his wife passed away. He lives with his two children, played by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, and his brother Merrill Hess (played by Joaquin Phoenix). One day, they discover large crop signs in their farm and notice that there were made similar crop signs in various fields in different countries and starts to wonder what's behind them. The story then deals around how Graham and his family come closer and closer to finding out what's behind the ""Signs"" and what they really mean and what's about to happen, and during this time, how their relationship towards one another expands.
Mel Gibson has acted excellently in the movie and so have the children. A good thing about M.Night Shyamalan is that he always chooses great child actors for all his movies, which is really interesting. Joaquin Phoenix also acted good as the funny guy in the movie, which game the movie it's moments.
All in all, if you would like to be entertained and have a liking for mystery/suspense movies, then this is a definite seeing for you.",1029456000,,2037,4.822857142857143
1479559,2,B00005JL3T,"This movie was beautifully acted (with, I'm sad to say, the exception of Mr. Shyamalan himself). The characters have depth. There are some poignant and emotional moments -- ""the last supper"", the goodbye wife, the what-you-did-when born scenes-- and we have the actors to thank for the depth of these scenes.
Nevertheless, my highest praise for this movie is that at no point did I seriously feel like leaving the theater.
The plot was unbearably weak. Some scenes were painful back-fill (the recruiter's office ""swing"" scene) so obviously there to explain something later in the film that I squirmed in my seat. The ""random firing of synapses"" set-up line was pathetic. Here I'm going to go ahead and give away some ""plot"" points since I don't believe there were really any surprises in the movie anyway, but stop reading now if you think you may care. Do you really think that aliens would mount an inter-galactic attack force to a planet seven tenths water and not have a plan for that? The twist in the movie is that the crop circles actually were made by aliens invading the Earth -- in other words, the twist is that Mr. Shyamalan's new movie's plot has no twist. It is a character study, and that would be perfectly fine, but even a ""pure"" character study needs a story framework built of more than spit and sawdust to hold it together.
Reverend/Father Farmer (was it his wife who planted all that corn?) discovers that all the random events and coincidences in life actually turn out to be ""signs"" and, even more usefully, helpful clues to how to react in the case of an alien invasion. Like we need a dead woman to tell us to hit the alien with the only weapon in the room. Or maybe the point is that the Reverend ultimately goes insane, seeing signs in everything; I'm sure that there is some clinical delusion that presents itself just like that. Boy, it must be tough to pick a breakfast cereal if your flakes are symbols of something.
Sixth Sense was unbelievably good. Brilliant. Remarkable. Unbreakable was a disappointment, but a solid, light-weight movie. Signs is a sad waste.",1029456000,6,2094,4.692934782608695

I know a lot of people thought The Sixth Sense had some pretty scary moments, but this one is so much scarier that it's beyond comparison. I wasn't expecting that.
What I was expecting is more superb direction from Shyamalan, and I wasn't disappointed. The thing Shyamalan does is make the impossible seem plausible and then completely beleivable by telling a huge story through the perspective of relatively average people. It's this perspective that allows Signs to be more than an alien movie or the Sixth Sense to be more than a ghost story. The characters in his stories have more depth and soul than 99% of the straight-forward dramas that hit the theaters these days. You care about the characters, they don't just exist to be eaten by monsters or run away from the scary ghosts. They ARE the story.
I'll go one further by saying this is probably the best movie I've seen this year. It was an emotional rollercoaster. The girl behind me went from screaming to crying to laughing back to screaming again in less than 10 minutes. It's that kind of movie.",1029456000,2,1318,4.495833333333334

Reviews I've read of 'Signs' seem to either praise it up to the skies or lambast it as a complete waste of money. I'd say it was neither of those - simply a poor to average film.
I enjoyed both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable', but not 'Signs'. All the elements of the previous films were there - MNS' slow, deliberate pacing, excellent performances from the central actors and the building suspense. But I could not care about the paper-thin characters, and without that, the suspense was meaningless. Sure, I was curious as to what was going to happen, but I didn't *care*. For the most part, the handling of the religious overtones was hokey and heavy-handed. Again, the poor character development might have interfered with my appreciation of these aspects. The ending to the film was distinctly unsatisfying, and raised more questions than it resolved. Finally, the poor special effects (if so they can be called) and 'alien invasion' plot aspects were ridiculous enough to be distracting.
That being said, there were several redeeming moments scattered throughout the film - some of genuine humour, some of genuine fear. Scattered as they were, these moments were all entertaining. I was fortunate enough to be able to observe the reactions of the woman seated next to me in the cinema to some of the more frightening scenes - that was worth my $$$ all in itself. Luck or miracle?
I've read elsewhere that the entire movie was a dream - that this was its 'genius'. If I were to ever give it another viewing, I might be persuaded that it was Bo's dream, but so what? It might explain the film's shortcomings, but it doesn't excuse them. I see a film to be entertained, and be it reality, fantasy, sci-fi or dream, I still want a quality story with characters I can make an emotional investment in. 'Signs' fails to deliver.

The acting is passionate and convincing--and it has to be, because the alien threat is well, not too threatening. The direction also stands out--great pacing, lots of suspense, again despite the story. Finally, ""Signs"" has a magnificent ending--always an unexpected plus.
The movie is basically a rehash of ""War of the Worlds""; so much so that at one point Joaquin Phoenix actually has to clumsily reference that story, probably to prevent sci-fi fans from yelling ""Foul!"". What made ""War of the Worlds"" so thrilling is that the aliens were so formidable: they used their dark mastery of science not just for interplanetary travel, but for incinerating helpless earthlings. The ""Signs"" aliens, on the other hand, couldn't outslug a grandmother with a spritzer bottle. This leads to all kinds of absurdities with their global ""attack"".
So, if you care about things like that, you won't be able to take ""Signs"" seriously. But, if you can suspend your judgment for a couple hours, there's enough of interest that you won't be wasting your money.",1029456000,,1173,5.114583333333333

 I was really enjoying the film, it had its tense parts, humor and drama- but then the climax came. Finding out that Merril was an ex minor league ball player in the films beginning and hearing that Grahams wife's last words were ""swing away"", -boy, I didn't see that coming (yeah, right). Then there was all the water being left around the house by little daughter Bo. Hmmm, could this be leading up to something significant? Then the climax came. You would have thought that the writers would have come up with something better than they did. The aliens are vulnerable to water so they just pack up and leave? Did I miss something here? C'MON!!! With the aliens apparent superior technology and considering that they've been coming to Earth for centuries don't you think that they would have known about water and its effect on them and taken precautions against this ""deadly"" threat? They would have at least been wearing a protective suit instead of running around naked! And then there was the alien that just let Merril beat him to death with a baseball bat without even trying to fight back, and also the fact that the aliens are busting through the house with no problem but just can't seem to get past that one basement door. I just wonder why the (professional) critics gave such high marks on this film considering how things just didn't add up in the end.

1479608,2,B00005JL3T,"I think the world of The Sixth Sense.  It is a movie that, to my mind, is so perfectly executed that it was a tragedy that it lost out to the inferior films at the Oscars.  I think that it was dismissed mainly by those who thought it was simply a clever ghost story.  Boy, did they miss real story.  I liked Unbreakable for the same reason:  interesting story cloaking a charged, emotional message about adult life and the small miracles that many of us stopped dreaming about somewhere close to middle age.
But I loathed Wide Awake, another film by M. Night Shyamalan,  It was one his first major release, and it was awful.  I made the mistake of buying the DVD.  I thought about giving it away, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  So, it sits on my shelf ready to prompt an embarrassing question like, ""Is this a good movie?""  God, I should have realized as soon as I saw Rosie O'Donnell in the credits that it would be a mistake to watch further.
But I'd forgotten about Wide Awake when I sat down to watch Signs.  After all, it was in the distant past.  M. Night had demonstrated that he had overcome his early ineptness at storytelling; that he had grown into a mature, highly intelligent filmmaker who would wow us again.
I was wrong.  Signs is closer to Wide Awake than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.  Let me tell you why I came away empty--despite Roger Ebert giving it 4 stars (?!).
Signs is another metaphorical story, a message movie about crises of faith cloaked in a story about an alien invasion.  In the same way, The Sixth Sense was a story about how people grow dead to each other, how husbands and wives, for example, neglect each other, act is if they don't exist in the real world, and otherwise become the living dead.  So too, Unbreakable was a story about growing up and losing faith in oneself and in the magic of waking up in an amazing and miraculous world.
But where The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable told their subtextual story in clever, subtle, and artistic ways, Signs is ham-handed, unconvincing, and, ultimately, a preachy little mess of a movie.  Unlike Night's other films, the cover story is neither coherent nor convincing.
They won't let me give any ""spoilers"" in this review, so can't include my catalog of errors, inconsistencies, and plot holes.  So, you'll just have to add them up.
Now, this movie clearly isn't as bad as Wide Awake.  I found Mel Gibson's character endearing, Joaquin Phoenix does a nice job, too.  And the children are endearing and natural.  I also happened to like the alien.  It was very creepy, mean, and disturbing.  I just hope his next film comes close to The Sixth Sense.

Joaquin Phoenix does a first-rate job as Hess' brother who has come to live with Gibson and his family on a farm in the heartland.

But I'm not thinking about it, because I'm too busy locking up my doors and boarding up my windows!
Now, I'm not easily scared by movies, and when my friends took me to see it I was very doubtful. Now it's an hour later and the only reason I'm not hyperventilating is because I'm distracting myself from thinking about this movie.
Now everybody can probably guess the plot of this movie: Mel Gibson plays a reverend who has lost his faith after the tragic accidental death of his wife. Now I can't tell if he's a farmer as well, or simply lives next to a crop of corn, all I know is that he can look out from any window of his house and see nothing but corn. He lives with his two children, Rory Culkin as the older brother, and I Don't Recall Her Name, the adorable younger sister (yes we all know her, she's the one who says in the commercials ""Daddy, there's a monster outside my window, can I have a glass of water?""), and the Ex-Father's younger brother, a former Minor League star.  His brother is my favorite character, he's so believable and comic. I suppose, as someone sad earlier, he's a third child, but not really. In some ways, his more mature than his older brother. The crop circles begin appearing and other signs and portents. The movie is theological and yet very very very frightening. As someone put it, the movie is done in a classic War Of The Worlds style. My favorite part is where they sit around watching the TV reports from around the globe. (Yes. They are wearing the tin foil hats. It's not as bad as it looks.) M. Night uses all the classic tricks, and they all work. He also manages to slip in some surprising yet not innappropriate comedy. It's not the world's greatest scare flick of all time, but GOD it's scary...

That's the point.  Sometimes life just doesn't make sense.  The talk between the two brothers about the ""types of people"" was, I believe, the core of the story.  Do we believe in miracles or not.

1479612,5,B00005JL3T,"After starring in hugely successful comedies and hit historical films, Gibson is back in a refreshing new movie. Very different from other hits this summer, in it's second week receiving over $110 million at the US box-office, ""Signs"" is a must-see. The movie doesn't bore you to sleep with too many details. It concentrates on the horror theme. It may not be the sixth sense but it's still great! The movie is very interesting and quite emotional. It definitely has the gripping suspense and the fearful moments that have made us enjoy horror flicks. It's yet another film by Shyamalan that'll make you consider similar things for quite a while.

  The Hess family- a modern everyday family with happy times all the time!- NOT! Problems are taking place with the Hess family-strange problems. The story revolves around graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson) and his brother Merrill who awaken to find their dogs barking fiercely. The kids (brother-sister) are wandering around in the cornfields as if under somebody's commander as if they're zombies. If that wasn't strange enough, crop circles are spotted. The TV industry is going wild, and graham tries his best to ignore it all. He reads about aliens (no! It's not an alien movie). The plot shows Graham trying to get things back to normal.

  Shyamalan once again shows that he's great at making horror flicks. He's prepared yet another brilliant film that you'll have to see this summer. It's a reality problems show and a horror hour show. It's mystical and thought provoking. The cast did a great job. The plot was enthralling. It deserves raving reviews. It has it's share of humour. It's a great modern thriller. It's spooky and it's worth a check.

  Despite having the mystery plot and the thought-provoking scenes, ""Signs"" is only a must for horror flicks, sixth sense, the others, and Gibson movie fans. You'll probably also enjoy it if you like interesting stories and love reading Higgins type mysteries. Don't bother to see it if you're looking for a romantic comedy (What women want), a historically based movie (Patriot, Braveheart), or a reality problems flick (the Mel-Julia duo film).",1029196800,27,2153,4.958333333333333
1479613,4,B00005JL3T,"Despite its B-movie plot (isolated family begins to suspect aliens are moving in on them), ""Signs"" is in fact a deeply involving film about the questions of personal faith.  Mel Gibson's disillusioned minister asks all the right questions en route to all the right answers, and his gradual realization of the truth is both convincing and moving.  Joaquin Phoenix lends solid support as Gibson's brother, and the child-actors acquit themselves honorably as well.  This is not your typical alien-invasion movie:  though the story has worldwide scope, we see it all unfold through the eyes of Gibson's slowly disnitegrating family. Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Signs"" is a thriller in the Val Lewton mode, eschewing sensationalism and SFX blitzes for a slow build-up of suspense through careful characterization and a dream-like atmosphere that methodically descends into nightmare.  Director Shymalan deserves a lot of credit for not only ignoring the general Hollywood stylistic traps, but also for having the guts to make a film that dares to portray spirituality in a positive light.

But the appearance of mysterious circular patterns in his crops is the start of a series of paranormal events that drastically affect Graham and his family.
""Signs"" also features Joaquin Phoenix as Graham's brother Merrill, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin as Graham's kids. Cherry Jones is excellent as a kind police officer, and director Shyamalan himself has a small role.
As in his huge hit ""the Sixth Sense,"" Shyamalan avoids flashy special effects and over-the-top action in favor of old fashioned storytelling and character development. He also blends some effective (and occasionally unsettling) humor into the mix. As in ""Sense,"" Shyamalan fills the film with details that reward the attentive viewer. It's all nicely complemented by James Newton Howard's creepy score.
The performances are superb. Gibson gives a career high performance as the heartbroken (and soul-broken) minister. The rest of the cast is also great, but I was especially impressed by young Rory Culkin. I had been blown away by the talented Culkin's performance in ""You Can Count on Me,"" and in ""Signs"" he continues to demonstrate his star quality. Culkin brings a potent blend of authority and vulnerability to his pivotal character.

1479688,4,B00005JL3T,"I just went and saw this flick this afternoon and I must say I really liked it and it works on more than one level.  The storyline is well known from the trailers, promotions, and the Amazon review: a resurgence of crop circles after years of respite along with strange occurrences and sightings leave the viewer wondering just what happened and what is to come.  One thing I will say is that this is not one of those Alien types of monsters jumping out of people's chests with blood all over shows.  The movie relies on suspense and a sci-fi plot to keep the viewer engaged and it will most likely engage you in the first few minutes provided you are awake, at least relatively sober, and paying attention.
I'm not going to go into the storyline other than to say it does jump out at you at unexpected times and from places you might not see it coming from.  While it is subdued at times it keeps coming at you with no slow paced build up like you see in some films and the low key parts merely make you jump more when something happens.
The movie also touches on subject matter in a way that some literature does as well and I'm reasonably certain it is no accident given some of the directors other films.  You have the element of an unknown force that may or may not be threatening and the question arises do you have faith in something beyond and bigger than yourself?  Do you believe in luck or is there no such thing?  When you watch the movie you can follow the plot line which is a solid sci-fi story on it's own really but I would recommend that you also read between the lines.  Sometimes movies can be a vehicle to express or comment on deeper social issues of the day.  Keep in mind the mood of the U.S. at the time this came out and the months and years preceding it and the fact that strangers are now so ominous given the murders and kidnapping that are going on.  There is also the shadowy enemy the United States faces that for the first time is expressly targeting American citizens who are innocent and average citizens just like the character portrayed by Mel Gibson and his family.  There is a long tradition of ""otherness"" like this in American movies and the apocalyptic nature of this movie makes it pretty interesting.  This movie does have apocalyptic and end time overtones for those who are interested in such matters.
I'm not really a huge Mel Gibson fan although I do think he is a fine actor who has been in some fine pictures.  I did really like his performance here and I think he really made the father of the family believable.  Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin all create likeable characters as well and I personally especially like little Abigail she did very well.
It's interesting that Amazon editorial characterizes this as a ""B"" movie and is so critical of it in general when it is obviously a ""hit"" and everyone I know who has seen it says it is a ""must see"" movie.  I guess no one bats 1.000 and I think their review missed the point on this one (an exception they are usually reasonably good in my opinion).  I would actually say that this will be worth getting on DVD because there are going to be a lot of people who did not see it in the theater who want to see it and you might just have fun having a movie party with it.  It might give younger viewers some bad dreams though so I would recommend a bit of caution in that regard but depending on the kid in question it's not really that bad.

1479689,3,B00005JL3T,"I admired M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, but I think SIGNS is his weakest foray into Twilight Zone territory.  SIGNS has some great and scary moments, mostly built on jump-out shocks or on keeping things hidden from view.  But the payoff just doesn't come together very well.  The religious aspects of the movie (Gibson's struggle with his faith) and the ""trick"" ending (which is becoming Shyamalan's signature mark) are too obvious to offer any real suspense or any real sense of surprise and wonder that one got with his previous two movies.
I also disagreed with the director's choice here to play a pivotal character.  In his previous two films, his appearances were nothing more than glorified cameos, but in this movie, his role is crucial to the plot and the dramatic tension.  And as good a director as Shyamalan is, he is not up the challenge of playing the character in this movie.
That said, there is much to enjoy about this movie, including a good performance by Gibson (who unfortunately seems as miscast as Bruce Willis did in THE SIXTH SENSE) and a nice turn by Cherry Jones as a clear-thinking deputy.  Shyamalan is also a master at developing a story slowly (albeit sometimes too slowly) so that the audience is kept guessing.
What worked in Shyamalan's previous two films, however, was keeping the audience's guess work more at bay, not letting them get too close to guessing the real ""twist"" he had planned.  Here, however, his ""twist"" is completely predictable, the result of some too-obvious writing on Shyamalan's part.",1029110400,3,1565,4.8830188679245285

Also, the acting was really good (very believable). This movie was also scary, but it didn't gross you out by showing tons of blood and guts. This movie is about (of course) signs appearing in crop fields. Yeah, it gets to be more, but I won't say who or what is causing the signs. See the movie, then you'll know. Or read other reviews. They'll tell you, too! This is a movie that also deals with family relationships, not just the freaky things going on in the world. It is a great movie, I highly reccomend it, so go see it.

1479691,4,B00005JL3T,"There seem to be a lot of comparison's of M. Night Shyamalan to Steven Spielberg, but that is unfair.  Shyamalan is a far more mature and character focused filmmaker than the former whiz-bang wunderkid of seventies popcorn features ever could wish to be.  The comparison's to Hitchcock are suitable, since Shyamalan shows the same mastery of subjective camera work that the Master of Suspense had.  But one comparison not made is that to famed screenwriter Rod Serling.  Not since The Twilight Zone has fantasy themes been used with such quiet power than in Shyamalan's building body of work.
Although there is a menacing alien invasion behind all those crop circles in Signs, the invasion actually is an important part in the main character's (beautifully underplayed by the usually comically manic Mel Gibson) crisis of faith.  Gordon Hess, having become an atheist when his wife dies in a horrible car accident, finds his struggle complicated by a crop circle.  As more and more circles spread and lights appear in the sky over major cities, it becomes apparent that some non-human force is massing for what might be an attack on Earth.
What elevates Signs above the average popcorn thriller is its preoccupation with the very real emotional struggle of the lead character.  As with The Exorcst, the paranormal is used as a tool in which to examine the mysteries of God's work and it is that that makes Signs something special.  Highly recommended.",1029110400,3,1451,4.966942148760331
1479692,4,B00005JL3T,"When I first saw a trailer/teaser for this movie, I was determined to see it. I am somewhat a fan of psychological thrillers (The Others) and enjoy most of Mel Gibson's movies. This movie delivered some excellent punches and lightened the mood with a little humor.
The idea is a former preacher, Graham (Mel Gibson) is a widower who tends a corn farm in Bucks County Pennsylvania (in the theater in Lionville PA the audience started to cheer when the name of the county came up on the screen). He lives with his two children and brother (J. Phoenix). The preacher notices some crop circles in his fields and does not think about it. Then reports from all over the country state that similar incidents are occuring all over the place. Then in Mexico, lights appear in the sky. The son believes it is an invasion.
What we learn is that Graham has lost his faith in God since the death of his wife. He no longer preaches the word and refuses to pray.
There is an effective use of terror in this movie, especially the birthday party scene in Brazil. I also was terrified when the house was boarded up and the aliens started attacking the house. Of course we never really see them until the end of the film, but that is what adds to the high level of tension. People are afraid of what they do not understand nor what they cannot see.
Character development is on a high priority in this movie. We know alot about these people by the end; including the children. The special effects were at a minimum but they were over shadowed by the plot. The aliens were uniquely different in design; and they were not pacifists.
I went to see this with a friend who did not want to see it because of the mixed reviews. I NEVER BASE SEEING A MOVIE ON A CRITIC. You should make you own evaluations.
This movie has alot of elements: drama, humor (classic Mel Gibson humor), science fiction and horror. It also has heart and the warmth of family.

The film is everything that films should be; all the reasons we love going to the movies are encased in this one, masterful two hour package. Cunningly simplistic yet effective in style, Shyamalan abandons almost all sense of the style that has permeated his first two films--the long, seemingly endless takes that shift the camera back and forth between actors instead of cutting, are just one example--and approaches this material with a fresh eye, yet the same crew.
The plot of the film is simple, as it should be. Plots about the possible existence of extra-terrestrials can be bogged down by too much detail. In this sense, it's much better to give us real characters. If they seem real to us, it makes the danger on screen feel that much more imminent. When the hand reaches for them, it reaches for us, too, and grabs our heart by going for the throat. We have our real characters here in the carefully calculated performances of Mel Gibson (an amazing, introverted performance from the normally flagmatic actor), Joaquin Phoenix (definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination), and two wonderful child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. The film comes to life, not through special effects and fabricated news reports (although ""Signs"" does use both to fantastic effect), but through these performances. Gibson plays the emotionally wounded former reverand Graham Hess as the head of a family that has recently survived a great tragedy that has deeply affected his faith in higher powers. Phoenix, as Merrill Hess, plays Gibson's brother, opposites in personality and use of curse words, yet the repore between them is undeniable. Then there are the children, Morgan and Bo. Shyamalan, like Spielberg, is a wizard of working with child actors. Culkin delivers a calm yet brutally truthful and intense performance as the first true believer. Breslin is appropriately cute as the youngest, naive child, yet she is absolutely convincing in her first big scene with Gibson when she asks her father why he talks to his dead wife while he's by himself. ""Makes me feel better,"" he says, after a brief moment of pause. ""Does she answer back?"" young Bo asks. Gibson, never breaking eye contact, shakes his head and replies ""No."" After a deep sigh, Breslin says, ""She never answers me either."" Thus the human element of the film comes even more into the light, and we are immediately drawn into the web Shyamalan has spun for us with this incredible ensemble cast of characters put into a wholly extraordinary situation.
There's not much I can say in the area of plot that won't give something away, but anyone who has seen the previews for ""Signs"" knows all he/she needs to know. Crop circles, possible aliens, Mel Gibson, a mysterious leg, a butcher knife used as a mirror. I suppose plot doesn't even really matter. I really wrote this review to tell everyone to see this movie as quickly as possible. I haven't been so thoroughly swept off my feet by a movie since I saw ""American Beauty"" (my all-time favorite film) three years ago. ""Signs"" is the best film Shyamalan has made. A thriller that pulls out all the stops, uses its soundtrack (or lack thereof) to build tension to a breaking point before letting us take a breather before we're finally catapulted out of our seats when the force of the crap that flies into our pants causes a sonic boom of screams to erupt throughout the theater. Character development, crucial to this movie as it should be in any thriller, is used to draw us in even further as we experience each scene, learning more and more about the lives of these four family members through unfolding details. And of course, Shyamalan never fails to impress me with the way he brings things full circle at the end, when every single line of dialogue and every character quirk he's added in suddenly becomes intregal to the plot, and we wish we hadn't taken that bathroom break.
""Signs"" is the first masterpiece of 2002. It may end up being the only masterpiece of the year. Like ""The Sixth Sense"", I hope this ends up as a timeless thriller that will haunt video shelves and the dreams of audiences for generations to come. This is first-class filmmaking. I can only hope to make a movie this good.",1029024000,3,4631,4.782771535580524
1479694,3,B00005JL3T,"While ""Signs"" is a motion picture which gets high marks for its dramatic nuances and scope, however, its effect on the ""fright-o-meter"" in many of the ""scary"" scenes leaves a lot to be desired. It would appear director M. Night Shyamalan wasn't given a whole lot of material to work with here, although the semi-all-star cast (Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin, to name a few) makes this effort flow through with relative ease in spots. For the most part, nearly all of the ""fright"" sequences lack any substantial punch and are abominable, except for one brief scene, which will make one's stomach cringe with a fairly sizeable degree of agony. Even with some physical and script inconsistencies, Shyamalan did an adequate job in the director's seat. If ""Signs"" had featured a mostly unknown cast, this picture really would have been a frightful disaster at the box office. Still an average flick, all things considered.",1029024000,,930,4.967948717948718

Mel's a little older but other than the times he is doing the 'choking face that's trying terribly not to cry' (a la Ransom and Patrioit) his character of a disolutioned ex-priest is entertaining. There is some clever humor and adult-child interraction all centered around the 'arrival' of what ever left the crop circles. There is some genuine suspense and clever twists on the old ET concept and the special affects are just right, although they play second fiddle to the human condition and observation...it's clever, thoughtful and not once did I want to go get a smoke the entire film.",1029024000,3,706,4.656
1479696,2,B00005JL3T,"I loved The Sixth Sense, and having seen the preview for Signs, I was prepared for a great film. What I got was ... disappointing.
It seems that Shyamalan decided to add some elements to his fledgling style of filmmaking, not excluding adding himself to the cast list. This usually wouldn't be a problem, except he couldn't act his way out of a sewage ditch, and it shows.
The plot of this film is a sad War of the Worlds ..., only a much less creative and plausible one. It wouldn't hurt for Shyamalan to add ""Based on a novel by H.G. Wells"" to his full-screen ""Written by M.N.S."" credits.
Overall, the film was unsatisfying, and throughout my viewing, all I could think was ""Man, the success of The Sixth Sense got to Shyamalan's head - he's just not trying anymore"". It seemed to me that he was just trying to make a point, instead of a film. Reasons? New ""comedy"" elements, his presence in the film, and the various ""subtle"" (*ahem*) references to his heritage.
To conclude, I would just like to add that Mel Gibson's a great actor, and it's sad to see that his talent was wasted on this film.",1029024000,,1097,4.4088669950738915

That was pretty much my reaction when I stopped shaking, which wasn't until 15 minutes after the end credits started to roll.  My muscles are so sore from shaking for an hour and a half, I think I may have trouble getting to sleep tonight.
""Signs"" stars Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson), his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix of ""Gladiator"" fame), and Graham's two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin).  Graham is a priest-turned-farmer, wallowing in the wake of his wife's death.  But that is just one of the problems facing him when this movie starts.  If you've seen previews of this film, you no doubt know that crop circles center heavily in the storyline.  But never in a way that you would expect.
Now I will admit that about 30 minutes into the film, I sat in the theater thinking, ""Where in the heck is this all leading to?""  I was starting to think that this movie was going to be a major dud, and that I'd forked over [money] for disappointment.  But that's when the movie slams on the gas pedal and doesn't slow down.  This is the only movie - and I mean, the ONLY movie - that has made my body shake for an hour and a half.  The tension and dread-like feeling of ""What's going to happen next?"" is absolutely excruciating.  M. Night Shyamalan (who wrote, directed, produced, AND acted in this movie) is clearly taking over as the King of Suspense when it comes to thriller-type movies.  He knows just when to hit you full-force in the face with something; he knows when to hint at something; and he's very good at making you think one thing is going to happen when something else really does.
I will not go much further into this film.  I don't want to give away any plot points.  But, my gosh, you cannot go wrong with this film.  If you liked such great movies such as ""The Others"" and ""Sixth Sense,"" this movie will be right up your haunted alley.  If you are looking for a movie where the power of suggestion is more frightening than what you might actually see, this movie is for you (I could write an entire review just based on that in and of itself).
Go see this movie.  It has everything you want in a classic, edge-of-your-seat, scary movie.  It made this reviewer coward and shake for an hour and a half, and that NEVER happens to me.  Heck, it made the entire theater audience do that!",1028937600,6,2421,4.385650224215246

1479733,2,B00005JL3T,"Admittedly, I am not a Christian or a person of any particular faith.  In my opinion, organized religion (including the Republican Party) has been, and continues to be, the cause of most of the evil in the world.  What has this to do with Signs?  The premise of the movie is that there are no coincidences; all events are parts of the divine, pre-destined puzzle, that inexorably lead to spiritual enlightenment -- hokum and bunk, simply put.
Mel Gibson is known to his friends and neighbors as Father Hess, though he doesn't want to be called that now, because he's not a ""Reverend"" any more, since his wife was killed in a freak car accident, and he's lost his faith, you see?  What puzzled me for most of the movie is what kind of preacher-man was he?  Besides Catholics and, I guess, Episcopalians, what sect's leaders wear collars and and are addressed as Father?  And a Catholic or Episcopalian Priest wouldn't refer to himself as ""Reverend"".  Reverend is an adjective.  Altar-dwellers are ministers or preachers or priests, or some other noun.  I dwell on this, because it is representative of the countless inconsistencies to be found in the movie, which make it seem like it exists in an alternate universe.
This movie is so predictable, I could have given an outline of the plot after the first 5 minutes.  But, M. Night makes us sit through excrutiatingly long scenes which are meant to be suspenseful, but couldn't be more boring.  Are all the countless extreme closeups of Mel Gibson's face really necessary?  He maintains the same blank stare throughout -- what's the point?  It's a darn nice looking farm Father Mel has there, but who the heck is running it?  Mel never raises a finger and his moocher brother apparently works at a gas-station.  Why is it in movies of this kind that kids are always smarter that grownups?  Reality -- I think not.  And the (pardon the expression) ""action"" scenes?  It's almost as though his cameraman was drunk.  The focus is invariably on inanimate objects while something (who knows what) supposedly exciting is happening.
About those aliens.  They have mastered the technology to travel countless light-years through the vast emptiness of space to come to earth -- for what?  They appear in huge spaceships, around the globe, attack, and we kick their butts in less than a day.  Well, no wonder.  They can't even escape from a pantry.
I've seen several articles comparing Shyamalan to Hitchcock (in his dreams).  As did Hitchcock, he likes to appear in his movies in ""cameos"".  The part he plays in Signs is not a cameo.  It is a featured part that could and should have been played by an actual actor (which M. Night most certainly is not).  His appearance only further underlines the unreality of the film's world.
This movie would have been a pretty good Twilight Zone episode -it may have 30 good minutes.

1479734,4,B00005JL3T,"(The following review is ""spoiler free."")
Let it be known that chances are there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be disappointed with this movie.  Especially if they're expecting another ""Sixth Sense"" or another movie with a shocking and twisted ending.  If you want ""Sixth Sense,"" then go see ""Sixth Sense.""  If you want to see ""Signs,"" then see ""Signs.""  This was a very different movie.  I enjoyed it very much, but at the same time I thought there were things that could've been done to make the movie better.
Another thing I want you to know is that I was one of the few who absolutely LOVED ""Unbreakable,"" which people thought was slow and boring.  Just want to show you that I have an open mind and I went into this film, not wanting to see another ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable,"" and I don't have a problem with a movie having more story than action.
The story is simple.  Mel Gibson plays a father who has lost faith every since the tragic death of his wife.  Now, it's just him, his two kids, and his brother.  Things are happening.  Very strange things.  It all starts with crop circles.  Then, more things start to happen.  (I really don't want to go into detail, because I don't want to give anything away.)  The movie doesn't focus on how the world deals with the problem, it focuses on the FAMILY, and how they deal with it.
This movie is pretty scary, for a PG-13 movie.  There are a lot of frightening moments that make you jump out of your seat, and it's done without a lot of special effects or CGI.  And the trailer does a good job of not giving too much away.
The acting was really good.  Everyone did a good job.  Mel, of course, was outstanding.  The kids were also great.  I liked how it was filmed and directed.  Lots of complicated shots and close-ups, very much like in the director's last two movies.
I just thought that this movie was a lot different than I expected.  Maybe I was hoping for too much.  I think the movie is really good, but it's nothing special or spectacular.  I think the critics are putting a little too much hype onto the movie.  Plus, this was one that I could not figure out if I liked it or not until a couple of hours afterwards.  Mainly, because I was with my friends when I saw this, and they weren't too impressed.  So, this is one you'll have to be by yourself afterwards and decide if you like it or not.
All in all, it's a pretty good movie.  Again, don't go into this expecting another ""Sixth Sense.""  That is the wrong approach to take when seeing this movie.  I really don't want to compare movies, but if I must, it is a lot like ""Unbreakable,"" meaning that there is a lot of story and character development.  So, this is one that no one can really help you decide if you'll like it or not.  I enjoyed it, but I can't recommend it, because I know that the feedback on this movie is going to be very mixed.  You're on your own, but if you want to see a really different movie with some really scary moments and top-notch suspence, then ""Signs"" just might be the movie for you.",1028937600,,3054,4.283216783216783
1479735,2,B00005JL3T,"Unfortunetly, I have to disagree with most of the reviewers featured here. I just Signs yesterday and felt compelled to write a review on the movie. I found the movie to be very boring and slow. Now, I am not saying I don't like any slow moving films, but this one just seemed to drag on forever. I almost found myself nodding off at some point. The story was interesting and thought provoking, but the way the story was executed just seemed boring. Plain and simple. A lot of people are comparing this to The Sixth Sense and I don't find any similarities between them. I liked the Sixth Sense, but I did not like this very much.
The last 30 minutes or so was ok, but even the ending disappointed me. Mel Gibson was quite good in it and Joaquin Pheonix was also pretty good, but it just seemed to me to be a waste of talent on such a sub-par script.

It has a very good message about the importance of family without preaching.

Night Shyamalan does an excellent job in not getting you ready for something. For example: making the characters relaxed or become more confident can make the audience relax, until something happens. Also, the score does an amazing job in setting the mood.
Graham Hess, a former reverend of the local church,who is played by Mel Gibson, wakes up one morning and finds mysterious crop circles in his cornfields, is it a hoaxe? To further confuse matters the news claims the same thing is happening all around the world. Graham is also perplexed by his daughter's sudden habit of leaving half-drunken glasses of water around the house and their dogs violent behavior.
Though the true question of this movie is not whether it is a hoaxe or not, but that there a two groups of people. The 1st group sees luckiness as just plainly a coincedence. The 2nd group believes that it is more than a coincedence, it is a sign from above.

1479864,4,B00005JL3T,"M.Night Shayamalan's ""Signs"" is about the loss of Faith. Specifically, Father Gordon Hess' (Mel Gibson) loss of faith after the accidental killing of his wife which prompts him to renounce his commitment to the church and leads to his losing his faith in mankind and in his children and brother (Joaquin Phoenix).
Gordon Hess and his family wake one morning in Bucks County, PA to find patterns carved out in their cornfield. Gordon and his family think that it is the work of local teenagers and laugh it off until these ""carvings"" are discovered all around the world.
What came to my mind was Erich Von Daniken's 1970's, ""Chariot of the Gods"" which proposed that aliens had made these carvings as navigational signposts: a way to guide their space ships to Earth. Shayamlan then takes on Von Daniken's mantle but adds his own interpretation and artistic vision of these ""War of the Worlds""-like events.
What makes ""Signs"" so interesting and human is that the focus of the movie is Hess and his family and not the aliens per se. The aliens arriving are, Shayamalan is saying, a direct result of we humans losing our faith in God, in ourselves and in each other: we're ripe for takeover for we have faith only in money, material goods and unbridled sensual pleasure.
One particularly emotional scene is one in which the Hess family is sitting down to a ""last"" dinner before, what they assume is the inevitable advance and takeover by the aliens, in which Gordon breaks down and sobs; as much for his lost faith as for his family's death: without your faith what do you have at a time like this?
Mel Gibson has never been better on screen: his humor and charm by now are a given, but here he strips away several layers of lacquered ""stardom"" and produces a performance with the pathos and emotional open-ness we haven't seen since the first ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously.""
""Signs,"" based on Shayamalan's other films, could have been nothing if not interesting, but to also be as thought provoking and emotionally available as it is... is a revelation.",1028764800,10,2072,4.742382271468144
1479865,4,B00005JL3T,"It is difficult to write a review for an M. Night Shyamalan movie without giving spoiler, but I promise I'll try. Though not as shocking in it's finale as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable (a highly underrated movie in my opinion), Signs delivers some nice scares, and some raw emotion as well.
Mel Gibson plays a former reverend who, after losing his wife, renounces his faith and dedicates his life to his farm and his two children. But one day, he awakens to find a mysterious circle in his crops, apparently a design of some kind and one he readily blames on local vandals. Apparently, he is not the only one. There are a rash of crop circles around the world. Some believe that it is the sign of an apocalypse, others beleive it to be signs of an alien invasion. What does it all mean? That is all I am going to say, go see the movie.
Signs got mixed reviews on it's opening, as did Shyamalan's other movies. The reason I can only speculate is that they were expecting some kind of Independence Day movie with a full scale alien invasion, or a movie about those fascinating crop circles. To be honest, it is neither. What is in the movie might suprise you, but there are times when it is quite scary. The frightening moments are laregly the ""bump in the night"" variety, but done with a great sense of style. The suspense in the movie is more on a psychological level, which makes the movie all the more freaky.
I have a lot of respect for M. Night Shyamalan's movies, he is one of the few mainstream directors who can suprise you from time to time. The trailer for Signs doesn't give any indication that the movie is about more than crop circles, but believe me, it is. The acting, while toned down, is superb, with Joaquin Pheonix giving a good supporting role.
Will you like it? Probably, providing that you go into the movie with an open mind and something to bury your head in when the tense moments arise (a sweater or your partner's arms would do nicely). Personally I loved it. Enough said.",1028764800,,1999,4.420054200542006

But a movie is more than entertainment...it's a commentary.
And this is an all too important film in light of the times we live in.
Father Hess breaks it down for us --
When 'bad things' happen, they scream at our flesh one of two options: God a) does not exist or b) must be malevolent.
SIGNS tells us though God may seem aloof, apathetic or nonexistent, He is ever present and He cares.  SIGNS tells us that God is good and He is in control. SIGNS is a story about faith...about listening closely.
I thought Night used the aliens as a clever plot device to communicate an all important message to an otherwise deaf world.  Our world is very intrigued by 'aliens' and entertained by the possibility of their existence...and night used our interest to feed us simple truth.  And since Sept 11th, the whole world has been asking: Why do bad things happen to good people?  How can a good God exist in the face of such evil?  Well...SIGNS answers those questions.
There is no such thing as coincidence.  Chaos cannot produce order.  Everything happens for a reason and is under the providence of
one good God.

1479869,2,B00005JL3T,"I really can't believe how much I disliked this movie, or how many positive reviews it's racked up.  Nobody was more antsy and excited than me to get into the theater to see ""Signs"", but about a half hour into the film my expectations began to deflate and it all went downhill from there.
""Signs"" is one of the most un-cinematic movies I've ever seen in my life, so wordy and static the script could easily be performed as a stage play.  Those who compare Shyamalan's technique here with Hitchcock and Spielberg...uh...no!  I realize that part of the director's intention was to capture the isolation and claustrophobia of a small group of people under seige, but this was done far more interestingly in Hitch's ""Lifeboat"" and ""The Birds"", and more recently in David Fincher's ""Panic Room"".
The whole theme of lost faith regained would have made a great thread running through the story, but the script bashes us repeatedy over the head with it to the point that I felt I was watching a Christian documentary.  Beyond that, the attempts to inject humor are too often and too forced, and the acting, with the exception of the marvelous Cherry Jones, is strictly soap opera 101.  One scene with Joaquin Phoenix visting a military recruitment office is so bad, it made me cringe at least as much as the aliens.
If you don't want to know the worst flaw of this disaster picture, the plot itself, stop reading here.
The aliens have been able to travel across the galaxy to launch an invasion against us, and yes, they are scary looking.  However, they have a lesser IQ than the average ornery insect, and didn't realize that the substance that covers 80% of our planet is what they have a fatal reaction to...and they weren't even bright enough to bring raincoats!",1028678400,5,1759,4.676375404530744
1479870,5,B00005JL3T,"Like the best episodes of the TV shows The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits, this movie uses a low budget to filter an epic science fiction story through a small setting. Also like those shows, Signs relies on acting, lighting, and things unseen, instead of constant special effects. However, when the effects appear, they work perfectly!
M. Night Shyamalan not only writes, directs, and produces, but also appears in a slightly unflattering role. But it's hard to hate any of the human characters in Signs. They are all likable in their own ways, and some of them are tragic. The emotional back-story makes Mel Gibson's character the most tragic of all, and those flashbacks keep interacting with the current suspense.
M. Night Shyamalan is a brilliant story-teller, and this is a satisfying movie experience!

Signs is a different sort of movie.  As a rabid Hitchcock fan, it is interesting to see the various ways Shyamalan mimics the master.  In this film you still have the great mood and suspense, but the audience is much more in on the story.  No big surprises at the end, but what a ride.  The crop circles/alien story line is the infamous McGuffin, the plot device that moves the story.
The movie is actually more about character development, the ups and downs of a spiritual walk, and reaffirming what is important in life, mainly friends and family. Shyamalan once again shows one of his true gifts, getting strong performances out of child actors.  He really seems to know how to work with children to get natural, yet spooky results.  Once again cinematography, lighting and camera work are excellent, although this story doesn't play up those effects as much as perhaps M. Night's previous work.
If you are a fan of Shyamalan's work, you should definitely give this movie a chance.  The less you know about it before the first viewing, the better.",1028678400,2,1224,4.655813953488372
1479873,3,B00005JL3T,"Let's review what we've learned about cornfields from Hollywood. Well, not only do they produce one of our most versatile and nutritious vegetables, but sometimes, they act as an afterlife portal for famous dead baseball players. They can also double up as a fabulous play area for Stephen King's children. M. Night Shyamalan's latest film demonstrates another handy use for a cornfield: ""aerial maps"" for alien pilots (even though they have the technology to build massive fleets of spacecraft capable of navigating light-year distances, these kooky invaders haven't quite got a handle on that whole ""G.P.S."" thing yet). Widower/ex-reverend Mel Gibson, his two kids and ""permanent houseguest"" brother (Joaquin Phonenix) are the lucky lottery winners in thier county for a cornfield-based UFO staging area. At its best, ""Signs"" has some gripping moments that recall Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" or Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead""; especially during the film's final third, which takes on a similar claustrophobic siege scenario. At its worst (and unfortunately for the bulk of its length) the film is a ""Close Encounters"" wanna-be, with an eye-rolling ending. The cast does an OK job with the material they have to work with, and Shymalan is obviously a talented filmmaker, but this material has been done to death. Worth a look for devoted sci-fi fans, but not destined to become a genre classic.",1028678400,3,1396,5.236607142857143
1479933,4,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is the latest film by M. Night Shyamalan and it is up to par with his ""The Sixth Sense"".  It delivers the chills and the suspense that ""The Sixth Sense"" did, but ""Unbreakable"" did not.
Mel Gibson would never have been my candidate (years ago) for an actor with ""legs"" (the ability to extend his career to the length and breadth that he has), but, man, he has proved me wrong.  Gibson is truly a chameleon actor - able to allow his characters to envelope his being.
Joaquin Phoenix, also, would never have been someone I thought would have any potential for a strong career as an actor.  I thought that his career would rise and fall due to his late brother's fame and talent.  Apparently, those Phoenixs are better actors than I gave them credit, because Joaquin is really a fine actor.
I think everyone actually knows the premise of the story, but here goes:  Crop circles are popping up all over the world and some have popped up in Mel Gibson's corn fields too.  Gibson is a recent widower and father of two, whose younger brother (Phoenix - a former promising minor league baseball player) has come to live with Gibson and family to help out.  Together, the family weathers the bizarre events that begin to unfold after the appearance of the crop circles.  Is it aliens?  As told here - yes - And how!
""Signs"" is a ""War of the Worlds for the modern era.  It's ""Indepedence Day"" without all the explosions and CGI.  Don't get me wrong - it's a good movie and I think it would be hard to truly be unique in this genre as it is now well covered territory in the shadow of a myriad of films and television shows on the subject matter, including ""The X-Files"".
What ""Signs"" does well is bring the whole genre back down into a more familial setting and turn up the tension by making it a 'haunted house' movie, so to speak.  We aren't subjected to, or fascinated by long detailed shots of the aliens, but rather see them out of the sides of our eyes (as it were) - in the shadows - and in reflections.  This is a tactic that has been effectively employed in suspense films since such films began getting made.  Its effectiveness has not diminished one iota!
You will be jumping repeatedly in this film.  It is really good.  I don't think it has the complex detailing of logic that ""The Sixth Sense"" displayed, but I think it is more indicative of the subject matter and less a complaint about the director or the script.
Check out this film and enjoy the ride.",1028678400,,2466,4.410596026490066

First of all, this movie is not entertaining. I can stand that it is not scary nor funny. This is Shyamalan's style. But I don't know why this movie is NOT SPECIAL AT ALL. ""Six Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" were full of imaginations and creativities. Shyamalan really made me feel:""Wow! How did he come up with such an interesting story?"" And that is why I am SO DISAPPOINTED. ""Signs"" is packed with REALLY OLD SCIENCE FICTION TRICKS, like ""a baby guard suddenly received alien communications"" kind of thing. And there are a lot of paradoxes, too. For example, if an alien's skin melts on the contact of water, how come he's not afraid of dew walking through the crop farm and not to mention the moisture in the air and rain.

Yes I have seen 6th and Unbreakable and I must say M. Night has the market on long, moving and drawn out shots. It seems to take forever to get from one place to another. Back to the story. The concept is cool and definitely movie material, however, as good as Mel Gibson is (and he is good in this), its just not interesting enough. The pay off at the ending was a disappointment and the wrapping of the aliens was very anti climactic. I don't want to ruin it for those of you who plan to see it soon, but be warned, the ending is NOT what you would expect.
M. Night seems to have the press favoring him and I have no idea why. I think he is not better than a lot of other directors out there and I know there are many more out there who are better Chris Columbus, Jonathan Frakes, Jay Roach and Robert Redford to name a few
I love science fiction, I love Mel Gibson and Joaquin and I love good epic movies and even with all the ingredients like these - M. Night did not do this story justice. Why?

Shyamalans here know how to make a movie of character as he has done before. He don't use special effects or mass murderers to give you chills. He use his direction and the good performances of the actors to combine with a great score and a movie that dares the audience to comprehend that the plot is just not about the world is about Graham family and how they adjust to the situation and believe me this should get better recogntion than what it have.

Nor do they refer to him as Farmer, and yet his property is dominated by huge corn fields. (Who's taking care of all that corn? Not Mel -- never once do we see him on a tractor.) The plot is activated by the sudden appearance of patterns in his crops and the immediate suspicion that aliens are threatening planet Earth. Am I the only one to recognize the obvious inspiration here? The threat coming from the skies, the visit to an isolated home where terror waits, a child's disrupted birthday party, a family barricading itself inside a house which is being besieged -- this is ""The Birds"", unfortunately without Alfred Hitchcock. Whereas that 1963 classic was taut with gathering suspense and climaxed by a horrific attack, ""Signs"" meanders along somewhat haphazardly and there really is no climax to speak of. (When the alien finally appears at the end, he looks sort of like James Arness in ""The Thing From Another World"".) Many scenes simply don't work. There's one scene where the hero, his brother, and the hero's kids are discussing the situation when suddenly the phone rings. The ring is quite loud on the sound track and the characters on the screen jump in alarm, but the audience I was with didn't react at all.

All three of his movies are trying to build up to an ending that is simply world-moving.  6th Sense delivered.  Unbreakable was a letdown.  Signs was a drop right into the dumpster.

4/5ths of the move was good.  That's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of zero.  Shyalaman does have talent.  He's great at suspense, and his movies are very touching and funny at the same time.  I loved the scene when the family is having what may be their last supper, and Mel Gibson grabs everyone together around him.  Or the scene when Pheonix explains why he's a 'miracle man.'  There's lots of good suspense, but, damnit Night, the last 1/5th of the movie was veeeeery bad, and made me regret watching it.

I know this was a movie about faith.  Hell, we were getting that beaten into us with a baseball bat.  But, if it's a movie about faith that involves sci-fi, and we're supposed to believe the sci-fi element is realistic, that the aliens are there and they're a threat, that it's not mass hysteria, then MAKE THE ALIENS REALISTIC!

...

So, overall, I give Night some good points for nice points in the movie and good direction, but major detractions for errors-in-fact, massive cliches, a huge letdown in the end, and logic holes.  Night, you're two strikes out.  After two bad experiences in the cinema theater, I'll wait for your next movie to hit DVD racks before picking it up.

I wouldn't exactly call it an action packed movie but I think Roger Ebert explained it best in his review, when he said, ""I cannot think of a movie where silence is scarier, and inaction is more disturbing.""

1479987,5,B00005JL3T,"""Signs,"" the third wide release film of M. Night Shyamalan's career, affirms the old saying: less is more. Subtlety and cohesion are his strengths, and this film demonstrates both in the same vein of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable."" With the multitude of ""scare"" flicks released these days, it's a blessing that film audiences can go to the movies without expecting blood and gore as the primary fright tactics. A frequent question posed in the world of literature applies to film: Can an entertaining film be serious? Shyamalan answers with a resounding ""yes.""
Moviegoers can put faith in almost any actor Shyamalan casts; they all give astounding and credible performances. Mel Gibson gives the performance of his career, but the real star is Joaquin Phoenix, who proves he doesn't need to play the role of an emperor in order to garner attention for his acting. The children, especially Rory Culkin, turn in good performances. One reason why his actors are so credible is due to the fact that subtlety is key; it's much easier to be genuinely afraid if there is ambiguity in a scene. Forget guts hanging out and scenes of knife stabbings - what you don't see (and what you don't understand) is what's terrifying.
Greatness is clearly here. That storyline cohesion that Shyamalan seems to favor so much is a refreshing approach in cinema today. Most elements resonate with authenticity (for example, a previous review mentioned the realistic news reports). Shyamalan has crafted an intricate web that can be appreciated by those looking for a genuinely worthy film and by those who merely want to have see something fun over the weekend.
In essence, Shyamalan may very well be the next Hitchcock and Spielberg amalgamated into one. The sense of awe he creates, his excellent filmmaking, and his ability to scare are all in his arsenal that has already taken him to the top.",1028505600,,1879,4.930599369085174

This one seemed to promise it all, and even throw in a little theology--a subject I love! But after two hours trying to figure out what the reviewers saw that I didn't, I left the theater as disappointed in a movie as I've been in a long time. Maybe the admixture of theology, humor, aliens, and dying dogs just didn't cut it. It certainly didn't for me.
The basic story is that poor Mel is Father Graham Hess, a disillusioned priest (a bit of a stretch in believability to say the least) who has lost his trust in God through the tragic death of his wife. He, his bother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix)-- the heavy-swinging strike out king of baseball, and two kids live together and discover--you guessed it, crop circles appearing everywhere. Through the industriousness of his son's love for alien books (he finds THE one book which will predict the aliens every move), our Mel realizes the circles were made by outer-spacers who might not be too friendly.
Mel further discovers that the circles are 'signs' (get it?) from above, and that everything has a purpose--even the gut-wrenching last words of his dying wife ""...tell Merrill to swing away!"" As this thriller concludes, Merrill swings away, the alien croaks, and we all learn there's a purpose in everything from glasses of water to baseball bats to lost asthma inhalers. All one has to do is just figure out the signs. End of story.
Joaquin Phoenix (he went from Gladiator to this?) is more of a third child than brother to Mel, as we see him sit in closet watching TV, and wear aluminum foil alien helmets with the children. But oh, can he swing that bat! I guess my initial sign (excuse the pun) that 'Signs' was doomed was when I found myself feeling nearly as much empathy for the alien as for Mels poor dying wife, delivering her last profound words. (Actually, at the time I was thinking more about who came up with the line parts of her are alive that shouldnt be than I was empathizing  with her pain""thats a bad thing.)
As I headed out of the theater, I wondered what 'Signs' was supposed to be. Maybe it was supposed to be an action film in the 'Mad Max' genre. It wasnt. It plodded along. I wondered if it intended to be a scary, eerie film like 'Poltergeist' (...theyre here!)""Nope. If you're frightened out of your seat at this one, you saw a different movie than I did. Well, maybe 'Signs' was supposed to be an intelligently scripted alien film, like 'Close Encounters'. Forget it""total alien time is less than ten minutes, its more a shadow than a scare, and 'intelligent' describes neither the script nor the alien.
Then I figured it out. Signs had a mysterious and complex plot like 'Fellowship of the Ring'! Surely there was a reason this film earned the reviews it got--I must've just missed it! Complex plot? Read the summary above again. So I guessed the film was mostly about crop circles! Wrong again. Other than the hook on which to hang the plot on (and get us into the theater), the crop circles were of little importance to the film. Of course, now I figured it out""'Signs' was a kid film! Far from it. Kids won't appreciate the lack of alien tension, and as a teacher, I can tell you""the two kids in this film were not only unrealistic, they were surrealistic. (And this guy directed Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense'??)
All in all, this film was silly, not frightening, and a twisting two-hour journey that really didn't take us anywhere. It only served to enhance some quippy one-liners by Mel that weren't all that funny, and give us a positive spin on life. ~Signs will be appreciated (Im sure) by those who want to adore the face-candy that is Mel Gibson, but the script is weak. It started to deteriorate early when Mel ran around his house trying to curse the bad old aliens without insulting his office of (former) priest.
I wish I had liked this movie. I love theology, aliens, mans faith in God restored, and all the other things this movie purported to be. But in the end 'Signs' was a big disappointment. Maybe it was trying to be so many things, it succeeded at none.",1028505600,14,4234,4.526109660574413
1479989,4,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is a great escapist movie, complete with suspense, humor, and characters you can cheer for.  Mel Gibson plays a disillusioned and recently widowed pastor who lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with his two children and younger brother Merrill, played by Joaquin Phoenix.  When crop circles appear overnight in the pastor's cornfield and the animals in the area begin to act strange, this movie lets loose.  Many of the scenes take place in whipping wind or at night or in rooms with long shadows, lending the necessary creepiness to the scenes.
The girl who plays Gibson's daughter is unbelievably charming with her childish deadpan delivery and sincere expressions; her natural performance is reminiscent of Drew Barrymore's in ""E.T.""  Rory Culkin, looking shockingly like his older brother in ""Home Alone"", is less compelling but still competent. Phoenix and Gibson do well separately, although they never seem to have the chemistry of brothers between them.  Their strongest scenes are with the children.  Gibson's interaction with the female sheriff (who once delivered the news that his wife was dying) and with his neighbor Ray (who was responsible for the pastor's wife's death) also sparkle.  I admired Shyamalan's ability to make the audience laugh uproariously one moment and gasp in fright the next.
The editing can be confusing at points, but it keeps the suspense tight as the camera blasts from one moment to the next. My biggest disappointment with this movie was how it fell apart after I left the theater.  The break-neck pacing doesn't leave the audience much time for thought, which is good, because the script is not nearly as well-developed as ""The Sixth Sense.""  Too much of it is unrealistic and even nonsensical - unfortunately, I can't go into the details without ruining the movie.  Anyone who knows Bucks County (and Newtown, which gets a cameo appearance) will cringe at the inaccurate way the area is portrayed.
In the theater, though, for a couple of hours, this movie is pure entertainment.  It's worth the price of admission (and when it comes out, the cost of the DVD.)",1028505600,6,2111,5.054755043227666
1479990,5,B00005JL3T,"I'm a big moviegoer, but I rarely have a great sense of anticipation about a movie, because I've learned that the more I look forward to seeing something, the more disappointed I usually am. So far the movies of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan have all lived up to the hype...
  Signs presents a Close Encounters type scenario, from a more down-to-earth perspective: The Earth may be about to receive an Alien visitation, but rather than taking a Global-response view to the impending crisis, we see the POV of Farmer Graham Hess, a former man-of-the-cloth who has lost his faith in the wake of the tragic death of his wife. The film opens with Graham, his Brother (Joaquin Phoenix), and two children waking to an amazing sight: Their Cornfield has been marked by a Crop-sign, and they soon learn that this is becoming a world-wide phenomenon. The children immediately leap upon the Alien-visitation theory, while Graham and his brother take the more down-to-Earth approach of suspecting local pranksters.
  Things soon take a more ominous turn, as strange noises are heard, Graham sees a weird figure on the roof of his barn, and the kids begin to intercept snippets of what might be an extra-terrestrial conversation.
  I kept waiting for Shyamalan to drop the ball.....creating a film that is based so much on the apprehension of a terrible event seems very tricky: If he had slipped up just once, shown a little too much (or not enough), the result could have been laughable. I'm happy to say he not only doesn't make that fatal slip, he actually manages to maintain that feeling of impending dread right until the last frame. I'm pretty jaded as far as fright-films go, but my heart was almost leaping out of my chest towards the end of Signs. This is a film that definitely bears repeated viewings. Gibson is superb as the concerned father whose shaken faith colors every aspect of his life, and Shyamalan has written the part perfectly. (The dinner scene, where one of the kids suggestion that they say Grace is met with an explosive ""I WILL NOT WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE OF MY LIFE WITH PRAYER!"" is astonshingly effective.) The acting is great all around, and I thought the casting of the Children was especially well-done.
  The restraint excersized by Shyamalan is very effective in building the mood. We get a feel for what is going on Globally, but our concern never goes beyond the confines of the farmhouse where the Hess Family lives. James Newton-Howard's score is top-notch, and adds tremendously to the overall creepiness of the experience. I can't recommend Signs enough. It's great to see a thought-provoking film amidst the usual summer brainlessness.",1028505600,2,2670,4.8915929203539825
1480049,4,B00005JL3T,"""Signs"" is a story ""like 'War of the Worlds'"" as one character self-awarely remarks, told from the macro and micro viewpoint.  Not only do mysterious crop circles appear in Gibson's field, but in hundreds of other fields around the world; mainly in India, as television news reports would have us believe.  As the possibility of alien invasion grows, television, radio, and an oddly prescient science book are the family's sources of abundant information.  The science book offers Shyamalan an opportunity for one of his patented clunky lines of dialogue:  ""If the aliens invade, it means that everything ever written in science books will be wrong.""  Of secondary concern, presumably, is the distinct possibility that they'll want to eat your face.  No matter.  As the story moves along, the global concerns slowly become a MacGuffin, and the local and familial concerns become supreme.  The film's focus narrows around Gibson and family and their struggles to comprehend and to survive.  It is an effective technique,
The film wastes little time in establishing its mood, and its influences.  The credit sequence -- a bold grey background over which is laid a four-story tall font -- is punctuated by a score that will only *not* remind you of Bernard Herrmann's ""Psycho"" score if you've been deaf from birth.  Couple this with Shyamalan's trademark cameo appearance, in a role that carries much of the film's exposition, and you get a good idea who he's trying to ape here.  His detractors, eager to label him as a wannabe-Hitchcock, will have a field day gathering evidence to support their claims here.  But Shyamalan mines a more spiritual side, for better or for worse, in his contemplative films.
Shyamalan is unable to shoot a bad-looking movie, helped no doubt by ace ""Silence of the Lambs"" lensman Tak Fujimoto.  His shot composition skills are near-perfect, must notably in the few scenes he arranges so that the camera peers through the farmhouse's window.  The effect this has is that the front lawn appears as if it is underwater.  A telling image, given where this film is going.  And in the film's key moments of fright, genuine enough that I and the people around me in the theatre leaped out of our seats at the exact same time, he tastefully shows only what he has to, leaving any big revelations for later.
Gibson plays priest-turned-farmer Graham Hess, torpedoed into a faithless funk by the death of his wife, who is still charged with being the gatekeeper of the town's morality even though he tells those who still insist on calling him 'Father' to stop.  Whenever Gibson put on his priest's collar, in the mishandled flashback sequences, I had a tough time believing him.  But when wearing his average Joe jeans and t-shirts his quiet earnestness worked.  Burdened by a script that tries to make every spoken line of dialogue weighty enough to crush most mortal men, Gibson does a fine job of lifting with his legs and keeping everything on his shoulders.  After the movie was about an hour old, and this is the best compliment I can think of, I forgot that I was watching Mel Gibson ""act"", and believed in the character he was trying to portray.  Not a prodigious performance, but fine enough by Mel's low standards.
Joaquin Phoenix, looking burlier than I've ever seen him, provides much of the film's comic relief.  Whenever the film threatens to get bogged down under its weightier and scarier moments, Joaquin shows up to deliver a Merrill Hess moment, which may include a pragmatic take on just who (""nerds... guys in their thirties who can't get girlfriends"") is making the crop circles, or a sympathetic -- and cute -- moment involving three Hershey's Kisses-shaped hats.  Despite the fact that nearly twenty years separates their ages, Joaquin and Mel are credible brothers, Mel's burdensome perfection offering a yin to Joaquin's ballplayer manque yang.
Abigail Breslin, as young Bo Hess, serves much the same purpose as Phoenix, i.e. deflating the suspense for a moment.  Except where Phoenix provided comic relief, Breslin provides what can only be called cute relief.  She's an adorable little sprite, with one gear: straight-faced charm.  But it's a gear that you can't help giggling at whenever the little tyke is on screen.  At one particularly suspenseful point Gibson tells her the story of her birth.  All the women in the room squealed when she emerged from the womb, simultaneously exclaiming that she was the cutest baby they'd ever seen.  It's a touching moment, given credibility only because Breslin is the kind of cute little girl that would elicit such a reaction.
Rory Culkin, so good as the innocent young son in ""You Can Count Me"", nearly crumbles under the weight of his character's precociousness.  Culkin does little more than stare pointedly at the adults around him, as if he is their peer.  It's a testament to this little man's skill as an actor that his Morgan Hess doesn't crumble under the weight Shyamalan shovels on him.
The denouement doesn't reveal just one secret, like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable""; it reveals many.  But with less effect.  If one had been paying attention all along, to repeated motifs and curious bits of exposition, the ending can be easily anticipated.  But it's not about the secrets that are revealed; it's about the realization that these secrets prompt from the characters.  The audience is never given a grand epiphany; they must empathize with the characters for the ""gimmick"" ending to work.  I think this kind of ""gimmick"" storytelling has run its course, though.  If Shyamalan doesn't trust that his stories are intrinsically interesting, so much so that he must throw in a twist ending as bait for audiences, than he'll burn out pretty quickly as a filmmaker.  He's got strong skills, and when he learns to trust them throughout, he'll finally make great movies.",1028505600,4,5870,4.9389002036659875
1480050,5,B00005JL3T,"I saw this movie early this afternoon, and here I am at midnight
feeling like something in this movie got into me and won't let go. Rarely has a movie gotten to me like this. I saw Psycho when I was a teenager and I got spooked in the shower for the next 20 years. And then there was Jaws, which spooked me for years even when I was swimming in fresh water.
This one is working on me, too.  I just don't know how.
If you are looking for a Sci-Fi movie made for adults, check this one out. If you are looking for something that doesn't look like just a video game on film, you'll be able to get into it, and it may get into you.",1028419200,2,627,3.86046511627907
1480051,5,B00005JL3T,"Right up front I want to say, this is truly one of the best flicks I've seen in a long time. It was paced, the cinematography was excellent and the movie score led you along and like the Erie score in Sixth Sense, never let you go. M. Night is becoming a guru in the field of how he lets the characters show how the movie is progressing; thru their facial expressions, you see in their eyes, what they are seeing in front, to the side, and to their backs. Thus making it even more spooky for the audience.  I am not fond of movies that go bump in the night, boo, type of thing as in (Resident Evil ). M. Night stopped way short of that, giving you a bump or I should say a jolt and it was like, ""Yeah I'm ready to leave!""
M. Night is also in the movie. He has been in a few of his other movies, earning him the labels of a 'Hitchcokian' type Director and his movies do have a flavoring of feelings from Hitchcock.
All the actors were superb, Mel as (Father Graham Hess) 'We Were Soldiers,' 'The Patriot,' 'Ransom.' Who gave up his belief in an all mighty being after loosing his wife in a freaky, horrific accident.  This accident is a pivotal point in Hess's thinking  as is the last words of his wife . Mels' expressions as all of  the others , were nothing short of perfection, but, after saying that I must say Joaquin Phoenix ,( Uncle Merrill) Clay Pidions , Gladiator, Buffalo Soldiers, does an incredible job  with his facials  and  those of the two children are not to be believed. Joaquin Phoenix is going a long way in filmdom. He is great!
 Rory Culkin , Morgan Hess, who did a great job in 'You Can Count On Me ,' does an even greater job in this flick. The scene of Morgan and his sister sitting on the couch, with their heads wrapped in tin foil so the Aliens could not read their minds is very funny. There are plenty of laughs in the first part of the movie, so hold onto them as it gets a lot more tense toward the end. Abigail Breslin plays the youngest of the Hess family (BO) and seems to have a water fixation, and is sort of annoying to her father.  But she is immune to  her critics .She has water glasses all over the house, and when asked by her father what is wrong with each glass, she can recite what is wrong with each one.
 Almost forgot Cherry Jones, Perfect Storm, Erin Brockovich, plays the sheriff who investigates the crop circles on Hess's farm and she is a very good actress. There are no slackers in this film.
The signs are there people and you had better not let this one slip thru the cracks of your cinematic knowledge of what's ""'really out there"". ...",1028419200,,2595,4.190763052208835
1480052,5,B00005JL3T,"In his most pensive and thought-provoking film yet, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan examines personal faith and explores the possibilities of predestination, in ""Signs,"" a riveting drama/thriller that also makes a case for the existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe; a film that questions the validity of coincidence, and puts forth the proposition that there is more going on in the vast expanses that surround our world than meets the eye.  It's Shyamalan's way of saying ""We are not alone,"" and he does it by whispering it in your ear rather than shouting to get your attention.  And get your attention he does, without question-- in a way that is spellbinding and unforgettable.
Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, awakens one morning and discovers a design, beginning with a huge circle, that has been inexplicably imprinted in the cornfield that surrounds his farm.  And he soon finds out that this is not an isolated incident; indeed, overnight the same thing has happened in fields around the world.  The burning question, of course, is who did it?  And moreover, how-- and why?  It's a mystery to which there seems to be no logical answer.  Or is it that it's too obvious, in which case it is also unbelievable.  These are questions that, over the course of the next few days, will fill every waking moment of Graham's life, as well as that of his two children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix); questions about things beyond contemplation.  Questions to which the answers can come none to soon.
After his remarkable film, ""The Sixth Sense,"" in 1999, the question everyone was asking was how is Shyamalan going to top that?  He responded with ""Unbreakable"" in 2000, another remarkable film that presented a concept of evil unique in the history of the cinema.  And with this film, Shyamalan has done it again, with another unique film that is a study in subtlety and nuance.  There is a quiet intensity to this film that evokes the kind of silence in a crowed theater that is rarely encountered.  From the opening moments, Shyamalan casts a spell over his audience, then maintains it as he continues to build the suspense, right up to the very end.  He draws you in by getting up close and personal with his camera, which successfully puts you ""in the room"" as the drama unfolds.  It's a studied presentation, and Shyamalan sets a decidedly deliberate pace that makes it work most effectively.
Shyamalan traverses territory that will be familiar to Ingmar Bergman aficionados, as he delves into one of Bergman's favorite themes, that being ""God's silence,"" which we find in Graham's ruminations of his own personal situation.  Add to that the best elements found in such films as ""Independence Day"" and ""War of the Worlds,"" with a dash of Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone,"" and you have ""Signs,"" a true original, unique in it's own right and artistically and imaginatively rendered by Shyamalan, a one-of-a-kind writer/director who continues to amaze with film after film.  Few directors can transfix an audience with such things as the sound of a cornfield rustling in the wind like Shyamalan can.  And he allows his scenes time to not only develop, but imply; and it's these moments of silence, in which he focuses on a doorway, or an empty swing in the yard viewed through an open window, or an intimate close-up of the expression on a character's face, that are so telling and entirely captivating.
As Graham Hess, Mel Gibson certainly hits his stride with his portrayal of a man who has come to a crossroads in his life only to encounter yet another challenge that exacerbates his inner conflict even more.  Gibson has a commanding presence on screen that naturally draws the eye, and his performance here has a reserve that adds strength and depth to his character, who is dealing with some very complex issues that transcend his immediate considerations.  To make this character (and the film) work, Gibson must convey a very real sense of personal loss and a need for redemption-- and he succeeds.  Shyamalan obviously has a knack for tapping into and bringing out the best in his stars; he did it with Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" and he does it with Gibson here.  It's an honest portrayal that is very real, and altogether convincing.
Joaquin Phoenix, too, gives a grounded performance as Merrill, a young man who has seemingly come to terms with certain aspects of his past, as well as the circumstances that have brought him to where he is at present.  The success of his portrayal comes from the fact that Phoenix manages to find the core of his character and play upon it.  It's a matter of having the kind of focus that makes the character believable, which is what Phoenix achieves here.  He also has the kind of chemistry with Gibson that makes their relationship as brothers credible, which, in turn, is essential to the overall credibility of the film.
Shyamalan has also worked his magic with his young stars, Culkin and Breslin, each of whom give affecting performances.  Culkin displays a maturity beyond his years that works well for his character, especially in light of Morgan's current fragile state of being.  And Breslin is absolutely endearing as Mo, a performance reminiscent of young Heather O'Rourke's Carol Anne, in ""Poltergeist.""
The supporting cast includes Cherry Jones (Officer Paski), Patricia Kalember (Colleen Hess), Jose L. Rodriguez (Radio Host) and M. Night Shyamalan (Ray).  A film that is intrinsically enthralling, at times frightening and genuinely eerie, ""Signs"" marks the accomplishment of a cinematic hat trick for M. Night Shyamalan, who is quickly becoming the new Hitchcock/Rod Serling of film, yet with his own unique signature.  This makes three ""originals"" in a row for Shyamalan, a rare feat even among the greatest directors.  The question now is, how is he ever going to top it?",1028419200,3,5958,4.934934934934935
1480053,4,B00005JL3T,"Actually, although tense and creepy, the film isn't so much about aliens and being scared by them as it is about each person coping with their own fears.
I really expected Signs to fail to live up to it's advertising and was pleasantly surprised that it actually surpassed the hype, though not quite in the way I expected. While the crop circles & aliens are definitely an issue in the movie they are not the main focus. The focus is on the family and how they are coping with their own fears and issues. This is not to say that the aliens aren't part of the story - they definitely are - but it's more a character study than a ""monster"" movie.
I think that one of my favorite things about the film is how lots of little loose ends are tied up. Things that don't seem too important early on become clear and vital later in the movie. In fact, I can't think of any issue that didn't get dealt with by the end.
The acting is really good on a variety of levels. Mel Gibson's portrayal of a widower who has withdrawn from his faith is touching and powerful. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job as the younger brother of Gibson who is searching for his path in life. The 2 children are good as well, turning in believable performances.
All-in-all, I believe that M. Night Shyamalan has proven his talent as a director (& writer). I will be looking forward to his next movie.",1028419200,,1366,4.319066147859922
1480054,2,B00005JL3T,"I looked forward to ""Signs"" since its trailers looked great. Too bad the film didn't live up to its potential.
I feel that Mel Gibson was miscast in this movie. While I love him in other films, this was not suited to his abilities. He plays a minister who lost his faith upon the death of his wife. First off, this is highly clich. The best acting job was actually done by the young Culkin boy. I just could not be convinced that Gibson was a priest as he tried too hard to fit the role. It's evident in the perception the viewer receives of his struggle.
Besides the miscast of the main role, the symbolism was too easily evident. I'll not go into what it is for those who haven't viewed the movie yet, but I will let you know that if you have an IQ higher than your height in centimeters, you'll spot atleast one of the three primary symbolisms that comes to fruition at the end of the movie.
I was left wondering why the flashback scenes were done the way they were at the times they were done. For instance, when you are scared senseless at what lies behind door number one and you know it's something hair-raising, why would you go into a flashback that lasts a few minutes? This has been done in the past and perfected for smart opportune times. They were not placed well here.
The aliens that visit have much to be desired as far as the costume. I can think of other flicks that had comperable aliens: the ""sleastaks"" from Land of the Lost; ""Gorn"" from the original Star Trek series; ""Godzuki"" from the Japanese Godzilla series; the martians in ""Mars Attacks""! This was quite [poor]!
I'm not going to go into the rest of the story because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I'll just say that the ONLY things I really liked about the movie is the suspense and the child actors.
There are too many holes in this movie and too many parts that have you muttering, ""but why doesn't he have <insert objects here> with him?"" This movie had great potential but flopped for this viewer. Save your money and rent it instead.

Mel Gibson does a good job as the father, have seen him better but this is by no means a ""throw-away"" performance.  He runs the required gamut of emotions with ease and he once again proves his versatility.  The supporting cast is fine, especially the two children.  The special effects are minimal and well done, but most of the ""effects"" are left to your imagination.  And isn't that the best effect of all?

1480057,2,B00005JL3T,"This is the worst science fiction film I have ever seen.  Yes, it was funny in many spots, certainly suspenseful, but ultimately very unsatisfying.  The film was not about crop circles, nor really about an alien invasion, but about one cleric's fall from faith as a result of his wife's macabre death.  If that was the story, did we really need an alien invasion to boost Mel back in the saddle as a man of faith?  C'mon!  Some lesser event would have sufficed, and THAT would have been a touching story.  Mel Gibson is always a fine actor, but the plot could not support his emotional load.  Joaquin Phoenix, also a fine actor,  was wasted in the role as his brother.  He must have needed to pay rent to take this role.  It certainly did nothing for his career.  I kept wondering if that scar on his lip was visible in ""Gladiator,"" a film I have enjoyed numerous times. The TV coverage of the invasion was unconvincing at best, unworthy of even a '50s scifi movie. The scene in the restaurant was as staged as a scene could be.  A table in the doorway of a restaurant? The water theme was unresolved.  Was that a baptismal image that got stuck in the writer's pen? The details of the wife's death itself, when finally revealed were unbelievable.
Better to have had the whole idea of an alien invasion be a mass hysteria than to have the dreaded alien actually appear.  (One infers that bad aliens have knobby fingers and vicious nails while good aliens have suckers on the ends of their fingers.)  Lines such as, ""They are only trying to make noise, they're not trying to get in.""  went nowhere.  Such confusion led me to think that Mel's wife's command to him to ""see,"" might mean that the alien was trying to cure his son, not kill him.  But then we wouldn't have had room for poor Joaquin to redeem his own fallen career as a promising baseball player by ""swing[ing] away"" at the alien.

1480058,4,B00005JL3T,"In the first half of the 20th century, O'Henry was one of the most famous writers of his time, famous for his twist endings. He wrote the oft reworked story, The Gift, about a young, poor wife who sells her beautiful long hair she's loved since childhood, to buy a chain for the pocket watch her husband loves. Her husband sells his watch to buy a beautiful comb for her hair.
M. Night Shyamalan may be this century's O'Henry, telling stories with wonderful twists-- twists with otherworldly elements.
I was surprised and a bit disappointed, before seeing Signs, since the reviews I encountered gave marginal ratings. But I enjoyed both of Shyamalan's other flicks, so I saw the movie the first chance I got. The theater, the biggest in a a mega movie house of 24 theaters, was totally filled.
And I was not disappointed. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat 98% of the time. It follows all the rules for good story creation and I got what I want in a movie-- a good emotional experience, with a chill, a shiver or a heartwarming good feeling. I left the movie very satisfied.
 The story: it's about crop circles which appear on Mel Gibson's farm in Buck's County. He doesn't believe, but his kids and brother do.

1480100,3,B00005JL3T,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I wondered how Hollywood would deal with the crop circle enigma. I wanted to enjoy the abundant talents of Mel Gibson and Joachin Phoenix. The special effects looked great on the trailers. It turned out that it wasn't a bad movie but it sure wasn't a good movie, either. I suggest that you might not want to pay movie theatre prices to see this one and that you save it for the video release. The script is pretty awful, very wooden in spots, not like real people talking to each other. The country cop, played with skill by Cherry Jones, is stereotyped with a pathetically folksy script. The military recruiter is a silly characature as is one of the local bad boys in a cut-off leather jacket with a bad hair day happening. A teenaged girl who is worried for her soul because of all her cursing is ridiculous and unnecessary to the film. Be forewarned, multiple use of the word ""douche-bag"" actually passes for humor in this film. Attempting to make the townspeople around Bucks County, PA seem simple turns them into one dimensional people. The plot is so preachy it is obvious and transparent from the moment we learn that Mel's character is a minister who has quit the church and won't spend another minute of his life praying because his wife was killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. Wonder if Minister Mel will change his thinking by the end of the film? Mel does his best with the limited script and makes his grief as well as his bewilderment in dealing with small children as a single parent very believable and touching. Phoenix is also excellent with the emotional parts of his role and adds a wonderful understated comic aspect to it as well. The two children in the film are cute and endearing and that's about it but that works just fine in this film. Their characters introduce both levity and pathos to the plot. The crop circles or signs look very realistic and are well filmed. The news broadcasts that pepper the film are useful plot movers and are done well.
 The plot of the movie is very absurd. There is an undercurrent of prescience which is not clearly developed. There are aliens that find it impossible to escape from a wooden pantry closet but who can bust through boarded up doors and windows, roofs and coal cellar chutes with ease. The alien aspect of the movie is so dumb it can't even match up with those sci-fi monster movies of the '50s. The human characters' response to the alien problem is utterly unbelievable as is the government response. The ending is so predictable I think I could have described it lick for lick even if I had left the theatre midway through the film.
 There are some suspenseful parts achieved with camera angle and sound but for the most part the film left me uninvolved. I enjoyed Gibson and Phoenix. I enjoyed the kids. I wish I could say better things about this movie, but unfortunately I can't.",1028419200,6,2919,4.547528517110266

It was very entertaining, and i found my finger clenched to the arm rest throughout most of the movie.  The corn Fields freaked me out.  I think i will never venture out into a cornfield at night again.  The use of camera Angles, and music greatly highlight key sequences, and somehow seem to make ordinary occurances scary as hell.

1480102,5,B00005JL3T,"Shyamalan is becoming well known for creating movies with great characters and creepy, twisty plots.  Signs is no exception.  The  suspense begins almost immediately with Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) running outside when he hears his children screaming.  He finds them in the cornfield, confused and frightened by the crop circles that have appeared overnight.
After that, things get really weird.  While crop circles are popping up all over the globe, someone is stalking the Hess family.  Is it the trouble-making neighbors or something more sinister?
The cast's performance was excellent.  I empathized with each of them as they struggled through the pain of losing a loved one while they fought their unseen nemesis.  However, the ending was too quick.  I left the movie theater feeling somewhat disappointed.  I had to sit there afterwards and think about all the clues that were strewn throughout the movie.  It was then that I realized what the real struggle was all about.
Signs is worth the full theater price.  As with all Shyamalan's movies, it will give you the heebie-jeebies.",1028419200,,1085,5.1022727272727275

The premise of the film was sound, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  Instead of focusing on what seems to be the point of the film, alien invasion, it comes across as a 21st century version of the biblical story of the prodigal son.  Rather than the prechiness, I would have much more preferred knowing more about the aliens.  Hopefully, when the DVD comes out, there will be some alternate endings, or deleted scenes included that will better explain what seemed to be the underdeveloped plot.",1028332800,2,614,4.648148148148148
1480104,5,B00005JL3T,"M. Knight Shyamalan is a modern movie craftsman.  He weaves simple yet elegant threads to create a rich thick environment.  ""Signs"" is another hit.
First off the audience in the theater was very engaged.  Even when I thought things were getting a bit slow the movie would surprise you and keep you engaged.  There were many times everyone in the theater burst into laughing tears, screaming horror, or simple contentment.  There was also a lot of whispering and commotion when M. Knight made his appearance.
M. Knight played his largest roll yet in signs and he did a great job.  Mel Gibson was great, but we would expect anything less than great now would we.  Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Patricia Kalember all managed to capture our hearts.  I thought that Joaquin offered up one of his best performances yet.  Rory Culkin gets a big roll and does not fail to deliver, but it was Patricia who stole the show on many accounts.  Then M. Knight, with his biggest acting roll yet astounded me with his acting abilities.  He certainly doesn't give himself enough credit because he was very good.
In ""Signs"" M. Knight opts for several visual effects, but he executes skillful restraint in doing so.  M. Knight the master of not using visual effects keeps in touch by only using visual effects when absolutely necessary.  Many visual effects (as in digital) are not digital at all.  Rather they are effects done in traditional means.  I really respect this as I think many directors have sold their soul to digital effects.
All I can say is that despite some slow or awkward spots, especially at the beginning, the show is a real winner.  I left the theater feeling great and even greater when I saw the huge line of people waiting for the next show.  I'm definitely going to add this DVD to my M. Knight collection when it comes out.  What magic will be in store for us next?  Only M. Knight knows!",1028332800,2,1896,4.622754491017964
1480105,5,B00005JL3T,"Just came back for seeing M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much.  The film features some really thrilling moments and will have the audience on the edge of their seats.  The cinematography is stunning and adds so much to the creepy atmosphere.  M.Night is one of my favorite new directors, and he did not disappoint me with this highly orginal take on the 'War Of The Worlds' theme.  And as much as the movie is about aliens and crop circles, there is also an underlying theme that deals with a man's search to regain his faith in God and to find the answer as to why sometimes bad things happen to the people we love.
The movie begins with a series of geometric crop circles appearing mysteriously on the farm of Graham Hess(Mel Gibson), a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was accidently killed by a truck.  At first he thinks it is a hoax perpetrated by some local hooligans, but when he watches the news and finds that these crop circles are appearing in all parts of the world, he begins to realize that something more ominous could be happening.  The animals in the area begin to act strangely, and Graham's own dogs act violently, as if they were barking at something that wasn't there.  As the tension mounts, more reports on the television about crop circles, and then some strange lights that are seen hovering in the sky over Mexico.  People begin to predict the end of the world.  Graham tries to protect his family as the reports become even more terrifying.  This all leads to a very scary finale.
Although the movie is filled with tension and suspense, there are also some great moments of comic relief, and they are interspersed nicely throughout the film.  Very good performances by Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix(Merill Hess, Graham's brother), but they are upstaged by the two kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.  Where does M. Night keep coming up with these great child actors from?  One minor problem I had with the film is a little too much reliance on sentimentality--in my opinion it could of done without so much of it and still been effective.  Also, in fairness I should say that I've already talked to someone who didn't like 'Signs' as much as I did, and I've read some of the bad reviews it has received, so my advice would be to see it for yourself, especially if you liked 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense'; if it is anything, it is certainly entertaining.  I am already highly anticipating M. Night's next effort.",1028332800,,2503,4.5807174887892375
1480106,3,B00005JL3T,"Having just seen the new movie ""Signs,"" to my surprise it seemed more like a comedy than a thriller.

The plot is very simple. Basically, aliens are making signs on the earth and using them as navigational tools to get around and harvest everybody. Yep, that's it. I expected this movie to be a complex, mysterious thriller with a surprising ending like ""The Sixth Sense,"" but instead I got a regular movie aobut aliens taking over the world. Think ""Independence Day,"" but much less aliens and much less action.

The overall intensity of the movie is usually not very great; almost every time there is about to be something scary something humurous happens. And that ruins the movie. How can a movie really be emotional or scary if something funny happens every time? I felt like I was watching a spoof of alien movies more than a real alien movie. And speaking of aliens, the people who made the aliens in this film didn't make them look very creative. They look like, well, the stereotypical kind of alien: Tall, green, big eyes. I expected them to look like the ones in ""Aliens"" or ""Predator,"" but I ended up being somewhat disappointed.

But a good thing about this movie (besides if you like watching comedy when you go to a horror movie) is the acting. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Pheonix are great, and M. Night Shyamalan himself makes a cameo.

Now about the ending: Instead of the usual M. Night Shyamalan ending, (which is usually full of surprising details, twisty turns, and shocking truths,) we get a really average one. Basically, there is a fight with one of the aliens that lasts about 1 minute. Yes, that's it. So you can imagine that when I walked out of this movie, I was a little bit disappointed. I felt like I'd seen a movie with a bad ending that was part comedy, part thriller, and part B-movie all wrapped up into one.

Don't get me wrong; ""Signs"" does have some scary moments, but the cons outweigh the pros so much that this film (which had a phenomonal amount of potential) turns itself into an average horror flick which is easily forgotten. Overall, it's a good popcorn movie to watch if you have 2 hours with abosolutely nothing to do. This film may not be the scariest movie ever made, but if you're looking for a movie with some good scares and some solid suspense, this movie will deliver in spades.

2002; 107 minutes; Rated PG-13 for brief strong language, some frightening moments, and some scenes with overall intensity.",1028332800,,2453,4.614678899082569

1480108,3,B00005JL3T,"I just got back from the packed theater completely dissapointed. Up until the last 15-20 minutes, this was by far Shyamalan's scariest and best film yet. But what followed was complete rubbish. Without ruining or spoiling it for fans who haven't seen it yet, it appears Night tried to tack a Hollywood ending onto his film. I listened to a couple of radio interviews with him, and he explained that a couple of critics had already complained about the ending. I hate to agree with them, but they might be right. I realize that Night's trademark twist at the end of his movies would have to be included in SIGNS, and the twist (not as shocking as SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE but far more complex in a psychological sense) depended on the movie ending as it did, but I think it would have been much more mysterious (and a hell of a lot scarier if they hadn't showed the alien) if SIGNS had ended differently. Still, I would definately go see the movie, since all the performances were perfect for the part, and the rest of the movie more than makes up for the lacking ending. Shyamalan isn't the next Spielberg, he's in a category by himself, and it looks like he can only improve from film to film.",1028332800,,1196,4.465753424657534

Night Shamalyn and the actors make you believe. It pulls you in at the getgo and you will be hooked until the end. Joaquin Phoenix and Mel Gibson give heartbreaking believeble performances as 2 brothers who believe the world is being invaded by aliens when they find a crop circle in their back field.

Night is so good he can take a shakey home movie camera and show two frames of a 3D alein and make you soil the theater bench. Everything provides a feeling of aboslute realism. M. Night's perfect touch with the news on TV make the movie even more realistic. Its not asking you ""Are we alone"", It actually puts out a good religous message and makes you think about how much control god has over your life. It is worth seeing more than once!

1480170,4,B00005JL3T,"Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on his Pennsylvania farm with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). Six months ago, after losing his wife in a freak accident, Graham's entire believe system has changed and his loss of faith has caused him to leave the church. He now leads a simple life among simple folk and swears hell never pray again.
The children are the first to discover the huge array of perfectly interlocking circles and lines carved into their cornfield. We, the audience, get an amazing birds eye view of these crop circles that take up at least the length of a football field. It is obvious that no man or machine could have bent the corn stalks down flat without breaking them. Graham and his family band together in a desperate attempt to discover the mystery behind this phenomena that has not only jolted the farmlands of Pennsylvania but has effected the entire planet.
This film pulls you to the edge of your seat early on and leaves you there the entire time. As the anticipation builds, the tension builds. Fortunately, theres plenty of, what other reviews have referred to as, comic relief. Just when you think you're about to scream, something will make you laugh. Theres a great sense of Alfred Hitchcock here, especially during the intro credits: the Psycho-ish music accompanied by the quick, sudden appearance of credits in really huge type . . . ! Writer, director and producer M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) also appears in the film. Only one speaking scene, but much more than a quick cameo. He plays a very key and memorable scene. Macaulay Culkin seems to have had some influence on younger brother Rory. Not only do they bare quite a resemblance in appearance and voice, but Rory has also proven to be quite the actor here. Abigail Breslin gives us an unforgettable performance like Drew Barrymore did in ET. And what can be said for Gibson and Phoenix? Wonderful yet different roles for both. Quiet, family oriented. Subtle? Is that the word Mel Gibson used? Yes, subtle.
This is an excellent thriller. Youll hold your breath, laugh, cry and jump off your seat, probably all within 2-minutes! Reality or hoax? Explore the real-life mysterious phenomena of crop signs and draw your own conclusions.
PS-According to Colin Andrews, founder of Circles Phenomenon Research International, around 10,500 crop circles have been reported since 1975. Roughly 80% have been proven to be manmade. The remaining 20% have not. They are real.",1028332800,3,2551,4.921113689095128
1480171,3,B00005JL3T,"I'm not trying to sound negative at all about this movie.  The movie had a good cast, and it was very realistic; first everyone thinks the crop circles are a hoax, but then more appear very quickly, and then a couple days later, there are UFOs flying over Mexico City (ironic?).
The beginning of the movie was, I thought, excellent.  My friends and I were on the edge of our seats for the first 1.5 hours.  Even the opening credits made us jump in our seats.  The whole movie, you are waiting to see what the aliens do.  You already realize that the aliens are hostil, and have bad intentions for the human race.
Then, as if Mel Gibson knew that the time had come for the aliens to invade his home, he boards of the windows and doors, but realizes that he doesn't board the attic doar, and hides his family in the basement.  After a tough struggle with the aliens (who can't even break open a door), they go away, and Mel and his family fall asleep in the basement.
When he wakes up, the radio is working again, and informs him that the aliens have left Earth (but they left their injured behind).  What do you know; the alien whose fingers were cut off by Mel earlier in the movie finds his house (how?) and takes his son hostage.  After a struggle, they kill the alien (with water) and his son wakes up (he supposedly breathed in toxic gas from the alien).  And then the movie ends.
All and all, I liked the beginning of the movie.  Actually, more then half of it.  Seeing the aliens walk across the screen, standing on his roof (""Daddy, there's a monster outide my bedroom, can I have a glass of water?), and having UFOs flying over the world's major cities definatly sent chills down my spine.
The entire movie takes place in ""The-Middle-Of-Nowhere"" Pennsylvania, so don't expect nuclear war with the aliens.  I would reccomend seeing this movie, but don't expect a big climax.",1028332800,,1881,4.436046511627907

Finally, a movie without the fast-pace editing from MTV and without the in-your-face ""lets spell it out for the audience"" methods of storytelling that plague so much of Hollywood today. Those kind of movies have their place, and can be enjoyable, but movies which take their time like ""Signs"" are rare today. Shyamalan uses the camera to scare us more by not showing everything. You can hear the horrible things happening, but are forced to imagine them, rather then see them. What you imagine is always worse then the truth, and this movie hits a home run in its suspense. Borrowing from ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" Shyamalan creates a homage to these classics by bending them into a completly new tale. His choice to focus on a single family during a global crises brings home what such an event would be like for you and me. If you like your horror and suspense spoon fed to you and need to see blood, guts and everything that happens, stick to Friday the 13th and Freddy Krueger.

You don't see the aliens till the very end so you don't know if they are real or not. It would be good if they could have worked it out so we did not see the aliens at all. Also they should have put a little more creepy moments like the hands sticking out of the doorway. But this movie has as much to do with Mel Gibbon's character as it does creeps. His relation ship with his family and religion, how he copes with grief and the outside world. The arrival of the crop circles makes him face all those issues.

This film shows that the things we don't see can be much more frightening than the usual blood and guts murder.

1480177,3,B00005JL3T,"I saw Signs yesterday at the theater with my mother and we both left feeling a bit dissapointed and confused. The movie which is supposed to be about a man (played by Mel Gibson) who's family is being left with these out of world ""signs"", is actually a drama about an ex reverend / preist (???) who's lost all faith in God as well as control of his family. The loss of his wife seems to have left this man a bitter, faithless and cynical person who's only keeping it together with the help of his little brother (played by the enormously talented Joaquin Phoenix). The signs and his lack of faith and his past seem to weave together leading the audience to believe that there will be some great touching climax that explains it all. Sadly, there is not. In fact, many of the questions in the film are left unanswered and some things were just down right stupid. Example: He calls himself a reverend, but the people in his town treat him like a preist asking if he'll listen to their confessions and calling him father. I find this to be terribly disturbing since the heart of the story obviously has nothing to do with aliens or signs, but is about a man's faith and his family. Many times (mostly towards the end) there are scenes that try to be scary, touching and inspiring all at once and it's about this time in the movie where you realize that the film's great set up was all for nothing. M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful with past films making you think the story was going one way and then revealing secrets and twists to turn the story upside down. In past films it worked. This time, it has not. What was meant to be a story about signs from another planet is neither thought provoking or scary. The only thrills come from the tension built by the incredible actors, an eerie setting and a great score. The real story is about a faithless man losing control of his life and if M. Night had followed through with the story that he had been building, this would have been an excellant movie. Too bad for us he sells out in the end and ends up confusing the audience. By the time the film was over, the tears that were being shed by those around me who were hoping to see a triumphant and satisfying conclusion were quickly replaced by frowns and puzzled faces; the most clear sign of the entire experience.",1028332800,3,2325,4.3842592592592595

From the heavy handed, film school level screenplay, the very bad CGI (which I won't go into detail about to avoid spoilers) and the, at times, bad acting by Mel Gibson, this film had me fidgeting in my seat almost from the get-go.
I loved ""The Sixth Sense"" and considered it one of the best films of 1999. I was less enamored of ""Unbreakable"", though it had its admirable qualities. I just didn't buy the basic premise which, therefore, ruined the entire film for me. But here, Shyamalan has a hit a wall. There are so many glaringly amateurish moments in this film that I am amazed the studio allowed it to be released in this form.
If it weren't for Joaquin Phoenix and the kids, this would have been a total disaster. Phoenix has matured greatly as an actor and he's the only character I cared about in this film. The kids were cute and precocious, but that's it.
If you feel you must see this film, see a matinee or wait for the DVD. Rent it, though, because you will regret buying it.

He was excellent in Gladiator, but if historical epics aren't your thing, go see Signs.  The previews make it look like its a thriller, which it is.

1480233,3,B00005JL3T,"This is another good, creepy movie from this director that will have you jumping out of your seat at times, but it has many weaknesses.  The acting is good overall, but the characters seem mostly half thought out.  Too much of the humor seems forced.  There is some interesting philosophy, but the moralistic ending seemed a little trite to me.
Being a sci-fi fan, I was disappointed by this aspect of the movie.  There's nothing especially original here -- the aliens are just evil monsters with a corny Hollywood alien movie weakness that makes them easy to defeat.  Though the trailer and title of the movie seemed to focus on the mystery of crop circles, the explanation for them is fairly uninteresting. I could go on about the lack of logic and originality of the sci-fi aspect of this movie, but science fiction isn't important in this movie, which is why it is treated so cursorily.  This is just a psychological thriller about a family in deadly peril, and a man in the depths of a spiritual crisis. On that basis, it's worthwhile.",1028332800,,1040,4.655737704918033
1480234,5,B00005JL3T,"Of course the big question on everyones minds is, ""Does Signs live up to all the pre-release hype it's gotten?""  After seeing Signs with my kids, I happy to say, ""Yes, it does.""
The story revolves around a man (Mel Gibson), his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and Mel's two children.  The mother is out of the picture because she was killed in a terrible accident six months prior.  And Mel (who's character is/was an episcopalean Father) has lost his faith in God.  Suddenly, strange circular patterns show up in their corn fields, and in corn fields around the world.  We never really leave the small farm where Mel and his family live, seeing only TV shots of what is happening to the outside world.  Lights are seen over Mexico and other nations.  Unexplainable and freaky.  An alien is captured on film and broadcast across the nation.  Mel's dogs begin acting aggressive and strange footsteps scamper across his roof.  They seal themselves into the house, nailing all the windows and doors shut.  Waiting for the end.  The end of everything.
The serious sideline to the movie (the death of Mel Gibson's character's wife) is vital to our understanding of the human condition.  Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as a washed-up baseball player who returns home to help his brother run the farm after the death of Mel's wife.
To call this film Science Fiction is almost a crime.  There are no ray guns, or high tech scenes involving space flight or mind control.  I'd list it more as a dramatic thriller than anything else.  But a darn good one.
So how does a man get his faith back?  Can some of these characters tell the future?  Is that M. Night Shyamalan acting in the film?  How vital was the little girl's saying, ""There's a monster outside my room, can I have a drink of water.""?
Watch and hold onto your seats.  It's funny, tearful, scarey and dramatic, all at the same time.  The best film of the year so far.",1028332800,,1928,4.628318584070796
1480235,4,B00005JL3T,"This is only a ""scary movie"" on the surface.  The dramatic theme underneath the creepiness and the jumps is faith.  It turns on an amazing speech given by the lead character about there being two kinds of people: one kind who believe in coincidences and are alone in the universe; and the other kind, who do not believe in coincidences and are not alone.
Director Shyamalan does, however, understand some things about a truly scary movie.  He understands that we are most frightened by what we can't see -- that the scariest thing is, in fact, our own psychology.  And with this film, he proves that multi-dimensional, human characters do not impair a movie's ability to frighten you.
The script is written without ""idiot plot,"" and tells a surprising and moving story about a former priest who is, in fact, really really good at being a minister.  A tragic event has taken away his faith and, because of the good writing and the beautiful performance by Mel Gibson, you see him hating himself even as he makes people feel better because his talent as a reverend isn't connected to genuine faith anymore, and so he feels like a faker.
The pace has been the subject of many reviews.  Personally, I found the pace to be right on, and was not bored for a second.  Highly, highly recommended.  Genuinely frightening, and a solid human drama, with very little graphic violence and almost no blood 'n' guts.  Now, if only we could get away from visualizing extra-terrestrials as anthropoid soldiers with militaristic ambitions...",1028332800,2,1523,4.804597701149425
1480236,1,B00005JL3T,"The movie trailer/previews had me more than enticed going into this movie.  Well, I just left the film entirely disappointed,  knowing M. Night has further damaged the reputation he built from Sixth Sense.  Try ""0"" stars.
This movie is weak, embarrassing and an exercise at feeding movie-goers window dressing and nothing more.  The ideas and story line are loose ends, sappy undeveloped sentiment and inconsistent.  Stop playing with the audience, especially when you don't have anything.  Enough already with the lighting, camera angles and suspenseful music.  Where's the movie?  For those of you who do get it, you'll realize that Mel Gibson has got to be so disappointed to be part of this film...
The humor is the only redeeming quality of this film. (Hershey's Kiss wrappers on head and so forth) The characters, their issues, etc. go essentially undeveloped and the final payoff is superficial, cheesy and so inconsistent with the supposed struggle that the character has to and pathetically does resolve(faith).  Hit me over the head already.  A.I. alert.
...You know, the general idea and image presented in the previews of Signs suggest incredible potential.  I think you will more than likely be strongly disappointed by this film and it's inability to even delve into the possibility of where this film could have gone.  I must add that I didn't expect to see ""Eddie"", the mascot of Iron Maiden, make a cameo in this film.
You be the judge.  I'm with ""Slow as Molasses"".  Weak, thin, frustrating, disappointing are the words that keep coming to me.

1480237,3,B00005JL3T,"You could get more propagandistic and emotionally manipulable than presenting evil aliens who gas helpless asthmatic children and are beaten to death by heroic American farmers with a Louisville Slugger, but - well, then again, I guess you couldn't.
It's horribly contrived, but M. Night Shmyalan's new thriller is at least very well made, and the cast is terrific. Mel Gibson is emotionally moving as an Episcopalian priest who has lost (and regains) his faith. Joaquin Phoenix is likeable as Gibson's kid brother, with strong audience appeal as a good-hearted homeland hero in the face of grave danger from outer space. And Gibson's kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are genuinely the most adorable kids you could ever hope to meet. Even the bit players shine, in this movie.
The production itself is gorgeous, though the soundtrack is a bit overdone. Shyamalan maintains a healthy sense of humor throughout the otherwise melodramatic plot and proceedings - with such bits as the kids (and then Phoenix) donning aluminum foil hats ""to keep the aliens from reading their minds,"" and Gibson's discomfort at swearing and listening to teenaged girls' absurd and unimportant ""confessions"" - but where he really excels is in sustaining suspense and menace through tight and claustrophobic shots, dark lighting, suggestively furtive glimpses of the aliens and really unsettling sound effects.
The script, however, has holes and problems: the alien attack (and its anticipation) seem to come virtually out of nowhere, even with an early appearance from the space ships; the aliens are assumed hostile without any explanation as to why, and their motivations are similarly glibly presumed before they've even done anything; the religious subplot is forced and contrived, and its implied ""divine sanction"" of war is shamelessly propagandistic at a time when America is aggressively selling war ethics; and the method of dispatching the aliens is not only grossly unlikely, but actually rather silly.
Still, Shyamalan does know how to put on a good show, and the actors make it all worthwhile. Signs is no War of the Worlds, but it is enjoyable.",1028332800,4,2141,5.208695652173913
1480287,4,B00005JL3T,"OK, been reading a lot of the negative reviews regarding Signs and had to throw my two cents into the fire.
I really enjoyed this movie. Yes the director bit a heck of a lot off to throw into a rather small scale intimate movie. But I for one was thankful he did.
Creepy? Heck yes. Thought provoking? Most certainly. Are the performances first rate? A resounding yes. A feat in itself as I am not a fan of good ole boy Mel. But this movie really left me with a lot to think of. Something that is all the more special in its effects/affects than some of the trite and shallow critiques I have read thus far.
Kind of tired of the computer graphics driven idiots that feel that good film making = big budget slam, bam, lobotomized mam. This is a small movie, with big thoughts. Go see it....no spoilers or plot divulged here. Just a note that you not be ready for some Star Trek/Wars gigahertz Dorito fest. Bring your brain, soul and maybe a hanky...

1480288,5,B00005JL3T,"The mystery and the wait is over. M. Night Shyamalan has done it again (directing, not his acting as he has a small role in this film). This is an excellent suspense film, classic Shyamalan.
The story begins with an unusual massive shape or design imprinted in the corn field of Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Father Hess has been left alone with his two children after the recent loss of his wife due to a fatal car accident. He has left the priesthood, believing that he was betrayed by the God that he has always advocated. His brother, Merrill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) helps to raise the children after the tragedy. Left without an explanation for the strange 'sign' in the corn field, Graham initially thinks pranksters are responsible. As Mr. Shyamalan interjects, we start to see bit-by-bit, segments of the alien presence.
From the opening scene through the entire film, the audience is held captive as each page unfolds. This movie draws us into the fears the family is enduring. Behind each scene, the intensity is amplified. Analagous to the ultimate poker hand where the pot grows in epic proportions as each card is exposed, we cannot wait for the culminating end of the final showdown. This movie will appeal to all audiences.",1028246400,,1240,4.799065420560748
1480289,5,B00005JL3T,"This movie was an amazing blend of humor, emotion, and surprises.  I honestly can't remember the last time I've heard a whole theatre scream at the same time.
Mel Gibson did one heck of an acting job..  emotion, fluidity, etc.. just about what we've come to expect from him.  As far as the rest goes.. the story was REALLY solid.. and finding a solid script in Hollywood has been somewhat of a challenge lately.
As far as the whole ""alien"" factor goes.. there was some exposure, but it was NOT your typical ""They're Here!"" movie..  as impossible as it sounds, the actual beings were really played down.
A lot of this film was left to the imagination of the viewer, which is what makes a movie great, as far as I'm concerned.
While I wouldn't recommend bringing the young'ns to this one, bring the rest of the family.  I'll be overly surprised if this flick doesn't win Best Picture (plus actor, supporting actor (male), and a few others) this year...",1028246400,3,950,4.564705882352941
1480290,4,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalen takes a page from the Sixth Sense and goes a little deeper creating a chilling movie about the unknown. The story takes place in rural Pennsylvania. The main character is Graham Hess (Gisbon) a former minister, who is recently widowed. Hess has completely lost his faith and walked away from the chruch. After the accident, Hess stays isolated at his farm away from the community. Helping him raise his two children, is his younger brother Merrill Hess (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball player. Then one day his children find several large crop circles in the middle of his cornfield. Is it the work of pranksters looking for publicity or are they the work of an supernatural entity? Several days after discovering the circles the family begins to hear odd noises at night, the wind sounds strange, and the family pets begin to act weird. There is something wrong and it begins to gnaw at Hess. Things get stranger when they watch TV and find that these circles are appearing all over the world. There are news reports of strange lights in the sky at night. Hess begins to believe the circles in his field are connected to these events.
I thought Signs borrowed heavily from the Sixth Sense. It had some of the elements. Some critics, think Shyamalan has fallen into a career trap, becoming another Alfred Hitchcock. However, I did find the movie very chilling, well-crafted and suspenseful. I especially liked how Shyamalan gave the added feeling of the family farm's isolation.",1028246400,,1506,4.863813229571984

1480292,4,B00005JL3T,"If there has been one major complaint among critics and serious moviegoers over the last 15 years or so it is that special effects, explosions, and other nifty gadgets have sucked the soul out of modern movies.  With a new generation of filmakers and actors now arriving and making their mark over the last few years, the trend does not seem to be changing soon. One exception to this, however, seems to be writer-director M Night Shyamalan.  If the name does not seem to ring a bell in every household, at least one or two of his last movies will.  In 1999, Shyamalan wrote and directed the neo-ghost story ""The Sixth Sense"" which ended up being a movie phenomenon with an ending that still has people talking.  A year later, he directed and wrote the underrated ""Unbreakable"" with Bruce Wills and Samuel Jackson.
Both movies were not without flaws but they revealed something.  That is, that Shyamalan was not only a born filmaker but, just as important, a born storyteller.  Like the early films of Spielberg or Kubrick, he was not afraid to tell a  suspense story that unfolded gradually. Often, the silence and atmosphere that permeated those films spoke louder than any bombs or guns.
Now comes Shyamalan's newest films ""Signs"".  On a personel note, this was the film I had been waiting for all summer.  (Much to the determiant of my review, however, I will not give away any key plot points ).  The movie begins in a sleepy farm field located in Bucks County, Pensylvania. The farm is owned and operated by a middle aged farmer identified as Graham Hess(Mel Gibson).  Mr Hess, we find out early in the film, is a widowed farmer and former clergyman. Living with him are his two children, Morgan(Rory Culkin) and Bo(Abigail Breslin) and his former minor league baseball player brother(Joaquin Phoenix).
Unlike his two previous films(especially Unbreakable),Shyamalan wastes no time getting started in this film.  The first scene starts out with Graham being awaken and led by his children out to the middle of his cornfield. There, to his understandable astonishment, lies a series of ""crop circles"" which are designed like an occult-like skelton key the size of a football field.  Are the crop circles an elaborate hoax or were they actually designed by an unidentified life source from a different planet?
Shyamalan, as he has demonstrated in the past, is a master at setting up truly frighful tales. As the story unwinds, more crop circles pop up around the world and the Hess family finds that the design in their backyard is only one small piece of a bizzare global puzzle.
I will not go into further detail regarding the plot.  Wether or not aliens appear or don't in this film is not the point.  A lot of critics who do not like the film, especially the ending, are missing the point.  The movie, ultimately, is not about aliens or even crop circles for that matter.  It's about the Gibson character.  As mentioned, Gibson is a widowed and a former cleryman who has lost his faith in God due to personel tragedy which, again, I won't reveal.  It is that loss of faith and, at the end, Gibson's redemption that is at the heart of this movie.
The movie is not perfect. As the story closes, all the pieces might not fit neatly and the audience may have some unanswered questions. It will also not appeal to cynics and people who want ""realistic"" outcomes.  To them, I ask, why go to the movie in the first place? At the risk of sounding corny, a lot has happened around the world in the last 12 months.  Corruption in our businesses and religious institutions now seem commonplace, and nations and people in general are more isolated than ever before. So much so that a film about an ex-clergyman regaining his faith in the middle of his farm in Bucks County, PA seems to be a perfect story right about now.",1028246400,,3817,4.675635276532137
1480293,2,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan crafts an intelligent and emotional extension of the ""are we alone?"" genre.
No heavy-handed effects shots, so Independence Day it isn't. What it does have is something you don't see much anymore: character development, evolution and redemption in a sci-fi context.
This might not work for the inattentive crowd, but for those who can put together more than a few sucessive thoughts in search of what the characters are feeling it's a refreshing change.
Mel Gibson gives a very good characterization of an Episcopal Priest who has lost his faith, much to the detriment of his family, while Joaquin Phoenix does quite well as his live-in brother.
Add two well acted kids, the family dogs, some peripheral characters, some tin foil (G) and a script that throws in just enough creeps as the whole world goes to hell around them and you have ""Signs"".

Mel Gibson plays a pastor who has lost his faith due to the violent death of his wife.  Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother; an washed up minor league baseball player who lives with Gibson and his two children.  As soon as the movie opens the family finds a rather large crop circle design in their farm field (which is in Bucks County, Pennsylvania which is a little under an hour from where I live), and later on they're dog behaves rather violently.  This phenomina starts to happen all over the world, and our answer of whether or not we are alone in the universe is finally answered.  Gibson and Phoenix are good in their respective roles, as are the children, and the movie is fantasticly shot.  Director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to direct with a lot of suspense, and it all pays off big, not to mention there are some parts of the film that are really funny and you'll find yourself laughing out loud right before you jump in suspense.  The ending however I thought was a letdown.  The same old story of keeping faith in God was a turn off for me, not to mention if your not quick enough to sort every detail through by the time the credits start rolling you'll be left behind in the dust and wonder ""what the..."".  However, Signs manages to deliver the goods for the most part, and is a clear showcase for a very talented writer and director who is clearly in his element.",1028246400,,1479,4.349090909090909
1480295,3,B00005JL3T,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" may not have the surprising twist of Sixth Sense, but it's definitely creepy enough to get the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up.
Mel Gibson, still suffering from the traumatic car accident that killed his wife, wakes up one morning to find an elaborate crop circle cut into the cornfield of his Pennsylvania farm.  At first he thinks it's a hoax, but as additional sightings are reported across the world and strange things start happening to his house, his views begin to change.
Gibson and Phoenix are upstaged by the great acting of young stars Rory Culkin (brother of that other Culkin), and Abigail Breslin.  Shyamalan has a gift for picking out and directing great young talent.  Only thing odd about the cast is that Joaquin Phoenix is supposed to be Gibson's younger brother, yet they look nothing alike.  Apparently, actor Mark Ruffalo was originally cast for the part but had to drop out due to illness.
The same slow, creeping camerawork of his other releases serve to build up the tension, keep you guessing, and effectively create a sense of unease.  That said, there are parts of the movie where you almost want to grab the camera yourself as it's falling behind the action.  Did someone hit the 'slow' button on the player?
You won't get in-your-face action like ""Independence Day"" so if that's what you're looking for, better off catching ""XXX"" or something of that nature.
