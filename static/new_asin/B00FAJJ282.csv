8613809,4,B00FAJJ282,"The prints are high quality.  There are four-disc set.  Two versions of the original (Blu-ray & DVD). Some of the films are ones I didn't know about, such as King Kong Lives (or King Kong 2, as it is in this Spanish version.  Be aware that, although they can be played in English, some of them have subtitles I can't get rid of.  Be aware, toor, that these discs are for Region 2, and won't play in most U.S. players.  The good thing, though, is that I was able to fast-forward through the dull bits in that film, and still be able to read the Spanish sub-titles.  Not a great film, but if you want a complete set of Kong movies, it is a set worth having.  Includes the original Black-and-white with Fay Raye, ""Son of Kong,"" and ""Mighty Joe Young,"" as well.  I thought it was worth the purchase, never having heard of ""King Kong Lives"" before.  It stars Linda Hamilton and Brian Kerwin.  It is the usual such film, where the military want to kell, and the heroine wants to save.  Some very bad acting with a few of the characters, although Linda Hamilton is okay.  She deserves a better film.",1505779200,,1092,4.325123152709359
