486905,5,6302526183,"This movie of Abbott and Costello is one of the weirdest, but wonderfully made.  It all begins when a radio bulletin announces that an escapee from jail is lurking around the city.  When he comes home, he tells the doctor friend of his to inject him with a shot that will make him invisible, but the doctor refuses, explaning the risk and symptoms he'll encounter are fatal, and can do permanent damage, such as blindness, to him.  But when the police come, and the escaped prisoner is the only one left in the doctor's lab, he injects himself, and then Costello comes in, and tries to shake his hand, but just before it can, it becomes invisible!  This movie has too much to say, so watch the rest for yourself. I highly reccomend this one.",1004400000,,741,4.466666666666667
486906,3,6302526183,"yes this is one of Bud and Lou's best, especially considering the low quality of some of their other films from this period.  (Comin Round The Mountain for example.)  However Universal didn't impress me with the new packaging with the trailers and the Woody Woodpecker cartoon.  The trailer has had the titles removed, and the cartoon is the same one that's on the Hold That Ghost video.  Considering the high quality and the great nostalgia in the first 6 re-releases, I was highly dissapointed in this one.  It seems Universal's main concern was getting it out in time for the Halloween promotion, and they didn't give it the care it deserved.  Great film, but if you own a previous version, don't waste the money for the extras this time around.",972259200,2,748,4.7153846153846155
486907,5,6302526183,"The popular thing these days when speaking of this film is to call it second only to 'A & C Meet Frankenstein, In this case, the popular thing to say is correct! The film is a delight and A & C are in rare  form. Arthur Franz, Adele Jergens and Sheldon Leonard give great  performances as well. Top notch direction and a script that is funny and  dramatic at once, make this a winner!",949276800,2,384,4.162162162162162

  Plot Summary:

 Champion boxer Tommy Nelson is accused of killing his manager after a fight. To hide from the police until he can find the real killer, Tommy injects himself with an invisibility formula. Dr. Gray warns him that the formula could drive him mad if he stays invisible for too long. Tommy Nelson then goes to two private detectives, Bud Alexander and Lou Francis, to help investigate the murder. By getting Lou in the boxing ring with invisible Tommy's help, they try to expose gangster Morgan as the real killer.

 Trivia (from imdb.com): (1)This was originally intended to be a straight film in the Invisible Man series. After the huge grosses from ""ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN""(1948), the script was rewritten to make it another thrill comedy with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. As it happened, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello met an invisible man in the earlier film, but it was a different character.(2)The last names of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello's characters, Bud Alexander and Lou Francis, are actually their real middle names.(3)The picture in Dr. Gray's laboratory of Griffin, the inventor of the invisibility serum, is a photo of Claude Rains, who played the title role in ""THE INVISIBLE MAN""(1933)",946944000,,2820,6.111405835543766
486909,4,6302526183,"By the 1950's, Abbott and Costello's film career was beginning to slide.  Fortunately, ""A&C MEET THE INVISIBLE MAN"" is a bright spot among these later films.  Since it seemed unlikely that the scare comedy of  ""MEET FRANKENSTEIN"" could be topped, someone wisely decided to  make this more of a mystery-comedy with a sci-fi twist thrown in.  And it  works.  Bud and Lou are joined by a great  supporting cast including Arthur  Franz (as the invisible one), Sheldon Leonard, and William Frawley (very  funny as a befuddled detective!)",943401600,3,532,5.011494252873563

7828145,3,6302526183,"Students graduate from the Dugan Detective School, among them Bud and Lou. They begin working the night shift and get their first client, who takes them to a house. Tommy Nelson wants the serum to make himself invisible! It's the only way he can escape the police. They don't believe Lou, and have him examined. There is a skit over passing the bucks. The special effects are good. Lou demonstrates his boxing skills at the gym. ""Louie the Looper"" will get a match with Rocky Hanlon. There is a plan to catch those responsible for killing O'Hara, the manager of Tommy Nelson. The skits are funny, but you can see the boys are older and less active.

The story continues with drama and comedy. Invisible Tommy will punch Rocky in the ring. But Tommy leaves the ring to listen to Morgan. He returns in time to win the fight for Louie. And so the story runs it course. The police arrest the real killers, and Tommy is restored to visibility with a blood transfusion from Lou. There is a happy ending with one last comic scene.

Aside from being another comedy based on a horror movie this film warned against betting on crooked boxing matches.",1200009600,,1140,4.556097560975609

A suspected killer comes to them to help prove he is innocent and later becomes invisible to hide from the police who happens to be william frawley (fred mertz from i love lucy). frawley had lou sent to a shrink to explain disappearing men and ends up hypnotizing the shrink - very funny. The theme is a boxing frame up, when a figher doesnt take a dive and knocks out the mobs boxer- you get a murder. Next Bud and lou go undercover as boxer and manager to prove the set up and with the invisble man as lou's real boxing hands it is very funny and a very well put together hollywood gem that you can watch with the whole family, unlike the current [stuff] hollywood puts out today, this is good clean fun and a keeper.",1046044800,,822,4.2756410256410255
