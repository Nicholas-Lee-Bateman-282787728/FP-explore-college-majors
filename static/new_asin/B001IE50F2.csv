8310914,2,B001IE50F2,Story is to dark and uneven. If Jen O'dell wasn't so nice to look at none of the characters are sympathetic or believable.,1398384000,,122,4.3478260869565215
8310915,5,B001IE50F2,Good to see a Michigan team doing great work. Very quirky literary feel with an interesting new twist. Definitely a worthwhile buy!,1236470400,,131,5.0
8310916,4,B001IE50F2,"Caught this movie at the Studio Movie Grill in Houston. Let me start by saying that the film is low budget, and there is no way around that. However, the story, tension, and dark humor shine through in this simplistic, Gaslight style tale reminscent of old Hollywood.

The performances are as good as you'll see in a low-budget flick, particularly Jennifer O'Dell, who stands out in her role as the femme fatale and shows a true grasp of the material in everything she does. Do yourself a favor and check this out. You won't be dissapointed.",1234742400,4,541,4.635416666666667
8310917,5,B001IE50F2,"I also saw Nevermore at the East Lansing film festival. I was intrigued from the opening scene until the unexpected ending. Good script! Judd Nelson is perfectly cast as jonathon usher and the supporting cast was very good as well - a fine omage to film noir as well as Poe.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Film-Noir-An-Encyclopedic-Reference-to-the-American-Style-Third-Edition/dp/0879514795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, Third Edition</a>",1229817600,3,534,7.359375
8310918,4,B001IE50F2,"I was recently invited to the screening not knowing what to expect from these first time film-makers and was truly impressed with the film Nevermore!  The movie follows the questionable mental health of a recluse businessman and his wife while an old friend enters the picture.....

I was most impressed by the acting of Judd Nelson.  He brilliantly portrayed the unstable role and benefited from the fine support of Vincent Spano and Jennifer O'Dell.

The movie flowed from start to finish while not following a stereotypical plot line which kept the audience constantly engaged.  I particularly enjoyed the lighting which did a solid job of conveying the various moods throughout the movie.

I give the production a 4 out of 5 because there was a noisy fan in the theatre.....Go see it!",1229299200,3,788,4.931818181818182
