8059342,2,B0009E3324,"Silent Mobius is a story about a team of women that fight monsters. It's like a lame version of Bubblegum Crisis. The things I don't like about this anime are:
1: The animation is bad. It's an older series, but the technology for way bTetter quality existed at the time.
2: The story had a good initial idea, but was not carried out in an interesting manner.
3: The characters. There were several characters with potential, but they weren't developed well enough to make you care  about them.
4: Bad voice acting. The characters didn't have any emotions visible in their speech.

Adding all these flaws together I was very disappointed by this series. If you're still curious try watching it on youtube. Definitely don't buy w/o watching first. I'll give it 2 stars because there was some effort put into the story line. It was just executed very poorly.",1350604800,2,854,4.6866666666666665
8059343,2,B0009E3324,"I'll start by confessing that I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing - but I doubt it was suddenly going to get good anyway. And I usually try not to write brutally negative reviews, but in the case of Silent Mobius I find I have little choice.

Plot: the usual thing, female team fighting sci-fi/supernatural monsters. Hidden pasts. You know how it goes. Whatever.

Acting: competent, not great. Over-acted (sub).

Scripts: banal, cliched, unengaging. Some anime makes the old formats seem fresh and interesting, but not in this case.

Art: stiff, ugly character design, and not even in a deliberate so-ugly-it's-interesting way like Blue Gender. Animation is competent but with no particular flare. Storyboarding is unimaginative, except for a few Blade Runner-esque city shots. Background art is mediocre, drab and lacking detail. Being made in 1998 is no excuse.

Music: episode music is cheesy synth stuff. Opening and ending themes are mediocre and forgettable. With few exceptions (e.g. Berserk), you can judge the quality of an anime by its OP/ED music - it indicates whether the series director has any taste, and whether he's prepared to go that extra mile to ensure a quality product. In this case: no.

So, despite the enthusiastic reviews here, I'd recommend against watching this show. The only noticable benefit for myself was an interest in seeing Blue Gender again. Blue Gender was ugly and flawed, but it was at least twice as good as Silent Mobius.",1202947200,,1477,5.032786885245901
8059344,5,B0009E3324,"Silent Mobius is a riveting 26-episode series that deserves a place in every anime fan's collection.  This bargain-priced set contains every episode on six DVDs...which are crammed uncomfortably into one extra-wide keepcase, decorated with a rather unattractive black and purple cover.  The artwork seen in the shows themselves is considerably better than the cover might lead you to believe, but it certainly isn't the best.  The people have angular features and pointy noses, and they're shaded with jagged highlights and harsh shadows that make them appear more flat than three-dimensional.  Their eyes are often diamond shaped and, with a couple of exceptions (namely, Yuki and Lum Cheng), more narrow than those seen in most animes.  Fortunately, the series makes up for these shortcomings with an interesting story and a plethora of well-developed characters.  These rain-soaked episodes are loaded with mystery, romance, and tragedy.  There are stories of time travel, crime drama, and sci-fi excitement.  The eclectic soundtrack includes everything from spooky pipe organ and choir music, to futuristic techno beats, to American-style pop and soft rock with English-language singing.

Each DVD starts with Bandai's surreal ""EMOTION"" opening titles, featuring the Moai statues of Easter Island resting in a lush green pasture and surrounded by swirling white clouds.  Then, the epic story of Silent Mobius commences, in 1999, as well-meaning sorcerer extraordinaire, Gigelf Liqueur, opens the doorway to an evil parallel world, appropriately called Nemesis, thus triggering a ""Silent Crisis"" that renders ninety percent of Earth's surface unfit for human habitation.  This tragic event ushers in the scourge of mankind, the demonic, weirdly deformed inhabitants of Nemesis known as Lucifer Hawks.  Some twenty years later, the gray-haired policewoman, Rally Cheyenne, forms the AMP (Attacked Mystification Police) and leads an all-girl team of specially trained officers in the never-ending struggle to rid the world of Gaea of these loathsome man-eating monsters.

Among the AMP team members are the vituperative redhead, Kiddy Phenil, who can beat any man from Mobile Division 1 in an arm-wrestling contest; the purple-haired Shinto priestess, Nami Yamigumo, who blocks out the Hawks with barriers made from strips of sticky paper; the computer visionnaire, Lebia Maverick, pilot of the sleek Simurgh aircraft; and the psychic coffee connoisseur, Yuki Saiko (voiced by Kelly Sheridan, Hitomi from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escaflowne/dp/B000E8NRNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escaflowne</a>), manager of the Labyrinth Cafe and keeper of the AMP teacup collection.  Rally's newest recruit (as the series opens) is none other than Gigelf Liqueur's angst-ridden daughter, Katsumi, who can chant powerful spells that eradicate Lucifer Hawks in a shining hexagram pillar of light.  Katsumi wields Grosspoliner, a magical talking sword that, when not in battle, assumes the shape of a metallic cow skull and sleeps in a comfy pink pet bed.  As the saga progresses, we learn more and more about each of the fearless female fighters, as well as their ruthless alien adversaries.

Although it's free of sex and light on bad language, Silent Mobius is rated 13 and up, probably because of some blood and violence late in the series.  The only special features on this set are textless opening and closing songs.  The back of the case says there's an illustration gallery, but I have yet to find it.  Nevertheless, this collection is an unbelievable value.

In conclusion, here are some words of wisdom from the legendary Avalanche Wong: ""Live through each day no matter what happens, and leave a message for tomorrow.  That is the purpose of life.""",1202256000,,3795,5.5979020979020975
8059345,2,B0009E3324,"It seems everyones happy about the price if this collection but they must not have watched it yet.

To give a quick and simple review, this movie has 5 main character ""girls"" fighting demons. There are a few good episodes but there are so many inconsistencies and plot holes that it bothers me. There is a large lack of action in most of the episodes and some corny love stories that no one will enjoy.",1182902400,,402,4.36

8059347,4,B0009E3324,"There are those who complain about the animation quality in this series, but we're not talking about a big budget movie.  If you want to see skimpy animation look at His and Her Circumstance or other series that ran out of funds.  The animation here is quite passable.

The story line is very good. Somewhat original, together with the character development, and the plot twists this stays watchable throughout the series.  Characters I think are important to care about, at least in a series longer than a few episodes.  I got bored with a series called Brain Powered about halfway through, and stopped watching because the characters seemed so undeveloped. Not so here, by the midway point you know the backstory of most all of the main characters, and their current desires as well.

This series is also an interesting blend of the occult and science.  Only a few series manage to do that without problems, Outlaw Star, and Blue Seed comes to mind. This series is probably closer to Blue Seed of the two.  It maintains a dark tone throughout, and is probably another anime that may have drawn some of its influence from the movie Blade Runner.

If you're looking for fan service you won't get much, this is not a series that hits all the usual anime cliches.  This makes it all the more unusual that you just keep wanting to watch more.  I've also seen some comments that the english voice cast is weak, but I've not seen that.  They seem fine, and well suited for the characters.  While this series will not likely go down in the world of anime as a classic, you'll rarely find a better bargain for your anime dollar.",1144281600,13,1621,4.586805555555555
8059348,5,B0009E3324,"Silent Mobius doesn't have the best animation.  But it takes place in a great world, with awesome characters who are well-developed and well-acted.  The stories and scripts are great, and so is the music.  For about a dollar an episode, you'd be nuts to not get this series, especially if you think you might like an anime series that wonderfully blends the mystical and the cyberpunk themes.",1140739200,6,392,4.82089552238806

8059350,4,B0009E3324,"Silent Mobius is on of those anime series which not follows completely the manga version. I already have most of the volumes of the manga and is not like the anime series.

But I saw  the series first so it will be not problem to those who do the same thing. But to those who already read the books and now are going to own the series...prepare for the changes and all. Even the way that the characters are is quite different than the books.

But I'll give a 4 star anyway...is a goos series to collect.",1127001600,2,503,4.164948453608248
