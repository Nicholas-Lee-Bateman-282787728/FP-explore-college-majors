A very, very well done film.",1398384000,7,143,4.538461538461538
6390938,3,B00JV0547O,"This is a sad, depressing, and gloomy, film about a homeless man trying to cope with the murder of his parents..and his struggle to avenge their murders..the plot wasn't that original,with no twists or turns. Few scenes of violence,but overall, the production quality was good and the acting was beliveable...the film goes to show,.. when you mess with a persons family....you never know how that person will react...it reminds of a true story i herd about the Suaerwald family in austrialia...how the father bullied the wrong person and ,...ultimately the whole family had to pay the price for their fathers mistake.....its crazy world out thare!!!! Pretty much boring***  if you have to watch something...rent , don't buy this one,you most likely will not want to watch it again an again!",1398384000,2,790,5.076923076923077

6390943,2,B00JV0547O,"OMG, this was a bizarre movie and not one I'd recommend. A young man whose parents were murdered (Macon Blair looking & acting like Bud Cort reincarnated) seeks revenge against the killer recently released from prison. The young man, homeless, living in his car, on the beach, pulls it together enough to track down his parents killer after reconnecting with his Sister. What comes next can only be described as ""surreal"", ultraviolent, and the ending leaves you scratching your head saying ""what did I just watch?"". I'm not against retribution mind you, but this film & lead character take it to a whole new level.",1517443200,,615,4.866666666666666
6390944,5,B00JV0547O,"This is a very good suspenseful movie from a new director, Jeremy Saulnier (and an unusual actor) playing the lead.

6390949,5,B00JV0547O,"This film absolutely blew me away. I wasn't sure what to expect with the premise, but trust me, this is anything but a simple revenge film. The handling of the main character, and the beauty of the cinematography and pacing is a thing to behold. I cant think of another movie in the 2010s that left me as impressed as this one.

6390958,5,B00JV0547O,Great revenge movie!,1502064000,,20,6.0
6390959,4,B00JV0547O,"Blue Ruin is a revenge flick, but it isn't done the normal Hollywood style.  The main character and those he wants revenge against for murdering his parents all look on the screen like real people.  Normally Hollywood would go with athletic looking people, the hero maybe but especially the villains would be bulked up and ripped physics.  No everyone just looks like people you encounter in any customer service job.  I don't know if these actors have been in anything else,but I didn't recognise them, which just adds to the realism of this.  The pace of the film is slow and dragged out at times, but again I think this just makes it work.  Again Hollywood's normal style, there would be car explosions, seemingly unlimited ammunition, people getting shot grunting and moving around as if they hadn't been hit.  Not so in Blue Ruin.  Not so at all.

Sure the main character who initially starts off the film looking like a homeless guy who hasn't shaved or cared about his appearance for years, isn't the brightest guy in the world.  But that's what makes it realistic.  You come across people like him all the time.  Not to mention violent thug families like those he has to deal with.",1500940800,,1189,4.663461538461538

6390964,2,B00JV0547O,"At about 30 minutes into the movie I realized it was a waste of time.  For some reason it reminded me of when I forced myself to read ""Catcher in the Rye,"" a book that was supposed to be so cool but turned out to be a boring, pointless book about a loser.  The main character in the movie was so incompetent there was no way he could have survived the first 10 minutes, let alone up to the place I stopped watching.",1499644800,,415,3.9879518072289155

I'm guessing all the one star reviews are from people who have no idea what quality filmmaking is. The movie is slow paced and understated so if you want a loud action packed movie than look elsewhere.

They thought of a lot of little things to bring out the realism in this one.  No big budget, no overacting.  No overdone character development in the beginning, they just immerse you into the life of a bewildered man that needs a reckoning.  Great situations in this one, lots of suspense, and the ending keeps you on your toes.  There is one screw up, if you can spot it.

Very impressive tale of a broken man attempting to settle a family score but with revenge never working out according to plan. Untidy, suspenseful, violent, this is a great sleeper. Director Jeremy Saulnier makes the most of his spare Virginia locations and Kickstarter budget. It's inspirational to see something this good wrought from so little.

Was ready to be a bit disappointed since this lacked any known stars in major roles and was an earlier effort by the filmmaker, but this movie is simply and purely a great film.

6390990,3,B00JV0547O,"This is a good movie that I enjoyed very much. I've seen from different sources,  multiple times, what an underrated an unknown film this is. This is a low budget film with high-quality acting and directing. The film is directed by the lead in the film I believe. He does an excellent job of keeping the watcher  enthralled and in constant suspense without over-the-top theatrics. This movie makes you feel as though you're there and you can completely relate with the main character. It's a movie about loss and revenge. But our main character was a doctor before his family was murdered and not a hitman or a violent criminal of some kind. And so he gets himself caught up in more trouble,  on the run from the law, the people he's trying to exact revenge upon and  the memories of his family. It's a dark movie but a movie with real humanity in an unimaginable situation .

After realizing the two were directed by the same and he also did Blue Ruin, I decided to watch it. Jeremy Saulnier is ...creative.

It's a not a fairy tale. It's harsh and depressing. But it draws you in to the point you cannot stop watching. If slow, dark and damp isn't your thing then don't watch it. Better yet, watch it and then leave a 1 star review.

It has great acting- as in characters don't make stupid mistakes and do exactly like they should given the situation. I find this movie to be much more watchable than Green Room, but both are worth a watch. Green room is traumatic. Epic, but traumatic.",1482624000,14,772,4.280821917808219

6391038,3,B00JV0547O,"Decent movie if you can suspend disbelief.  *Spoiler alert*  The hero is a homeless bum who lives out of his car and seeks revenge against his parents' killer and the killer's family.  1) Hero doesn't have money to buy a gun but finds an old high school buddy who just happens to have a collection of guns and is a crack shot sniper.  2)  Said friend helps the hero dispose of a dead body and gives gun/ammo to our hero to accomplish his mission thereby becoming an accessory to murder but, who cares!, this is a movie.  3)  Friend tells hero not to give any speeches to his victim before killing them.  When our hero gets the drop on his victims, he gives a speech instead of shooting which leads to everybody's demise.  So not a bad movie for Amazon Prime (and God knows there are plenty of crappy movies on Prime) but wasn't too realistic for me.  Maybe I'm being too harsh since movies, by their nature, tend not to be realistic.",1481414400,,933,4.341040462427745

6391090,3,B00JV0547O,"Blue Ruin is an enjoyable flick if you are looking for a smaller story with a character that defies the traditional loan wolf hero mold by thrusting upon you a timid individual who after losing touch with humanity has t he ability to seemingly do almost anything outside of his traditional wheelhouse. The movie, as Hemingway would say, tells a true story in the sense that it does not try and force you to like the main character or for you to even fully understand his path of logic but instead opps to paint a human picture of a man trying to do what  he feels in the moment is right.  Though this was interesting a lack of depth to all the side characters who seemed genuinely interesting- even more so then the protagonist at times- greatly hinders the end result of the film.

Visually the movie is weighed down by stereotypical indie film color grading, its almost as if they simply chose a single filter that was akin to snapchat off of Adobe and for being shot with a Cannon EOS-C300  there are no excuses for a film that comes off visually more as a student short film at times than a small budget film with actual cameras and lighting as apposed to a GH4 on cine mode shooting 4k. Yes, we get it, Blue- its everywhere in the film, its in the name of the movie, it relates to the feeling (sort of), you like blue- try not to overdo one color constantly or the visual pallet comes off as having no character.

+good acting
+nice small story
+good depiction of a real human being handling a problem like a real human being as opposed to a one man army type.

-annoying visuals
-the audience is only shown the sister for a short while and thus has no real attachment to her making the character's final motivations fall short of something that could have had much more impact.",1476921600,,1783,4.387878787878788

6391094,5,B00JV0547O,"Seems as though most of the 1 Star Reviews are made more than likely by Michael Bay's biggest fans.  Take a film class and learn about pacing.  Film is to remove people from reality and put them in an alternate life that doesn't exist.  There is a fine line between possible and completely science fiction off the wall.  The negative reviews on Amazon shouldn't deter you considering there is a near 8* rating on IMDB.  I don't even need to attempt to write my own synopsis, as there are a few so eloquently written so far.

This movie is about a scared, unsure, and yet purpose driven man.  He seeks vengeance and has given up his life of normalcy to live in solitude to grieve and contemplate what he would do to the accused person who has brutality taken away ones loved by the protagonist, Dwight.

Artfully shot with a pacing similar to a western, thrown into a drama/thriller.  There are brief moments of comedic relief that pepper up the gloom circumstances that remind you that you can still smile even when life is funneling into a downward spiral quickly.

Again, as most negative reviews that have no actual content, those opinions are as empty as the person who wrote them.  This film cannot be described in 10 words, but instead, Blue Ruin is a catalyst of some of your worst fears driving you to lose touch with the outside world all while having one purpose in life, even if it should end yours.",1476835200,7,1410,4.511811023622047

6391099,5,B00JV0547O,"""Blue Ruin"" came out of left field. It's a quiet, understated film told as much by characters' facial expressions and what they don't say as what they do. The plot is simple: A man realizes someone who wronged him has been released from prison, and takes action. I'll leave it at that because as much as this story has been told in different iterations, this telling is unique and special. How it unfolds is as important as what happens. Avoid reading literary-style descriptions of this film until you see it. Until you numbly watch the closing credits and give thanks that filmmakers exist to follow such visions -- visions that open in a handful of theaters, dwarfed by the latest spandex superhero reboot.

Don't get me wrong. I enjoy my ""Punisher"" (2004) and ""Dirty Harry"" vengeance fantasy-action films. ""Blue Ruin,"" however, has some of the most mature and disturbing presentations of violence that I have seen on film. It doesn't revel in the violence or fetishize it; the camera doesn't cut away from the few instances that occur. They just happen.

In the same vein, there is no heavy handed plodding. This isn't ""In the Bedroom,"" with its linear flow and melodramatic reactions that received critical acclaim. We watch as a rank amateur acclimates himself to violence, and its progressive path toward ever greater violence. The actor, Macon Blair, is quiet and unassuming, with sad eyes and small shoulders. He isn't menacing. There is presence, but no raw physicality. Hollywood presents its avenging angels as steroid hulks or as fitness model types, but the reality is that the most dangerous people typically don't look the part. Real violence comes in the form of an ambush, perpetrated by the determination of someone who is willing to go through you. Likewise, we see the will to do something to right a perceived, the consequences of action and reaction, and the struggle to cope with who one is, what one is becoming, and what one has to do regardless of what may come next.

What we see here is balance. A quiet film that isn't plodding. A revenge film with an actual motive. A protagonist, and his foes, who live and breathe. It's a cast of relative unknowns; you're not pretending you don't see famous actors. A mix of wide lense and close-in shots, conveying beautiful beaches and forested backdrops, contrast well with the events portrayed.

It's been awhile since I saw a film that made me ask, ""What did I just see?""",1476489600,2,2443,4.809523809523809

With little dialogue Macon Blair portrays his character's thoughts, emotion, and trouble through his eyes, expressions, and even his posture.  This is a revenge movie, but not a mindless one that worships violence for violence's sake.  A man who lost himself, after the murders of loved ones, is brought awake by some news and he moves to take action.  I liked how he puts together his plan with thought.  In most of these movies the character would magically have everything he needed, but here he searches for a weapon and it, and other pieces of his plan don't go smoothly.  It made the story seem truer.  My favorite line Id forgive you if you were crazy. But you're not. Youre weak.  That line has a lot of shades of meaning.",1475884800,,776,4.532374100719425

6391150,5,B00JV0547O,"I can see where Reality TV and Kardashian fans would not like this movie. This is not a mindless film but one which requires the viewer to think. Compared to a big budget movie, like The Captive with Ryan Reynolds, this movie deserves 10 stars. Macon Blair did a phenomenal job of playing Dwight, a homeless man who learns that the killer of his parents has been released from prison. He is a good man who cares about others and the revenge he seeks is to right a wrong, not just for revenge's sake.

Several times I was amazed at the natural flow of the dialog and how much certain scenes made sense. Not really giving anything away, but in one scene Dwight finds a grave and decides to desecrate it. Before he does you see him over the kitchen sink seeing how much water he can drink. In another scene he is concerned about a friend's continued involvement in his revenge scheme so he removes the battery from his truck so he can't follow him. Some of the negative reviews complained about lack of character development, but these two scenes alone show the mind of the lead character. Just a little too deep for the Reality TV crowd who are used to See Spot Run dialog.

Another notable performance was given by Devin Ratray as the helpful high school friend. Never felt like he was acting.

I hope more people see this movie, because unlike some of the big budget films, this movie delivers.",1475280000,,1394,4.458823529411765

Throughout much of the film, Dwight wants things to be done but the feud demands things to go on. This to me clearly shows it is a story of a feud not vigilante revenge. And there is a big difference between the two. The ending isn't depressing as much as it is correct. That's how a feud ends.

This movie goes slow and there are long stretches with no dialogue but there is plenty of tension due to the protagonist being the exact opposite of Arnold Schwarzenegger. There's the feeling that this guy, way out of his element, is going to screw something up. And he does, but manages to keep going and make do.

6391287,4,B00JV0547O,"Blue Ruin is a bit hard to classify in the best possible way. I could easily call it a slow burn noir but I could just as easily call it a revenge thriller. One of several things that makes this film stand out is the lack of dialogue. Director/writer Jeremy Saulnier tells us everything we need to know through images. The words we do hear are so very banal that we instantly recognize them as every day language that real people would use. There are so many opportunities that are ripe for the type of exposition heavy speeches that many films deliver but Saulnier never makes that mistake. He allows us to see and understand on our terms. Macon Blair inhabits his character so fully that we never doubt him, his motives, or his decisions. The title of this film refers to the car Macon drives (as far as I'm concerned) and there is a surprising moment early in the film where that ruined vehicle shows that it has been hiding a secret. The entire film is reflected in that moment if you care to consider the film when it finishes. I strongly suggest you give yourself the opportunity to see Blue Ruin and find it's secrets for yourself.",1473724800,,1138,4.44976076555024

I felt the writer/director did a very good job with what to leave in and what to leave out.

He was inept in carrying out the revenge, but because of driven by raw emotion, he was driven to the final destiny whether he likes it or not. There were no real heros or villains. Both sides has a reason for the actions they took. Essentially both sides let revenge took over their lives. This escalation could only end with a bloody final act. Even the two other side characters, his friend and the teenager from the other family,  provided a nice counterbalance to story's emotion driven narrative.

Dwight is a seemingly shy, blinkering homeless man living out of his car, eating from dumpsters and stealing the odd bathing session via breaking into a vacant home. News comes to him that the killer of his parents is out of prison, news delivered in a manner that suggests that Dwight will soon be running for cover in the opposite direction of the ex-convict. But no, Dwight has been awaiting methodically for this very moment to occur. Revenge is, and has been, his very reason to live. Bathe, shave and start the car, Dwight. You have a blue and ruinous task at hand.

Although Amazon doesn't list them, I found the Special Features at Fangoria.  They wrote:

While its disc isn't filled to the brim with extras, BLUE RUINs Blu-ray does come equipped with an impressive amount of special features for a film produced so quickly, and on such a low budget. The highlight comes in sole featurette, No Regrets, which details the making-of BLUE RUIN through behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with those involved. As stories range from fascinating to inspiring to heartbreaking to hilarious, the passion that flows through this featurette is infectious and well worth its moderate run time.

The other features on the disc are fine, though not as good as No Regrets. The feature commentary from Macon Blair and director Jeremy Saulnier is informative and occasionally fun as they drink throughout, but far too middling to justify sitting through the track entirely. The two deleted scenes on the disc, which come with optional commentary from Saulnier and Blair, fill in some gaps in the narrative but are justified in their excision, as they don't provide much more in terms of story or subtext. Finally, the camera test, used as BLUE RUINs Kickstarter video, provides an insubstantial, if interesting early look into what the film eventually became.",1444694400,,1495,5.131687242798354

6391424,4,B00JV0547O,"BLUE RUIN is the kind of movie Im hoping to see when I take on a very low budget, very independent film.  Seems to me there are two types of indies:  the ones starring lots of famous people trying to build their indie cred or work with an auteur director (think Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach, Whit Stillman) and the ones with no names working with no money who turn in something truly original and interesting and entertaining.

BLUE RUIN falls into the second group, and it is a solid entry.  Writer/director Jeremy Saulnier and star Macon Blair (who also co-produced with Saulnier) have produced a gripping little revenge movie.  I almost called it a revenge thriller, and while it has some thrilling moments its really more about the moral price of revenge, the lack of straight villains and heroes in the real world and the impact of a single-minded compulsion.

We first meet Dwight (Blair) as a homeless man living out of his car, and scrounging for sustenance.  Hes clearly reached bottom, because he picks through trash at the fairgrounds, breaks into homes to take showers and is generally doing NOTHING with his life.  We see hes intelligent, but suspect hes damaged as well.  Very soon, he finds out that a criminal who obviously did something TERRIBLE to Dwights family has been paroled.  Dwight is not a strong man, nor anyone we would think would be a man of action.  But clearly the psychic damage of his loss has left him bereft and finally hes got a task he can latch on toavenging the crime.

I really don't want to spoil any more, but lets just say this story takes some surprising turns of both plot and character (especially character) and yet, all these twists and turns have an inevitabililty about them.  How could things possible go well, and who would ever have thought they would.  Dwight is our guide throughout the film (we see it all through his eyes, really) and hes a compelling loser.  Blair plays him with such specificity and clarity and commitment that we sympathize with him all the way.  Its a slow paced, deliberate movie, but I still found myself wanting to talk back to the screen or yell at Dwight when he was in danger, just like I might at a more traditional thriller or even horror movie.  The script is extremely sparse, and choses its words pretty carefully.  There are welcome glimmers of dark humor, particularly around the time Dwight meets up with an old high school acquaintance for some help.  The performances, while not exactly polished, are highly satisfactory.  The film is simply shot, but has a good sense of place and atmosphere.

My only complaint is that the ending is a letdown.  What HAPPENS is not an issue, but it felt a bit hurried and did not resonate as I had hoped it might.  I enjoyed 95-96% of the film so much, it was doubly disappointing to have the end misfire.  Its not a disaster, but it feels less satisfying that our journey with Dwight should have been.  Nonetheless, I highly recommend the movie for a seasoned movie-goer looking for something different.",1434758400,4,3033,4.666666666666667

6391432,4,B00JV0547O,"Dwight (Macon Blair) is a homeless man living on the Virginia coast in his beat up 1991 Pontiac (see title).  He has no money but scours the beach for bottles he returns for pocket change.  His clothes come from charity drop boxes, his food from dumpsters.  He bathes occasionally by breaking into homes while the residents are away on vacation.  He hasn't cut his hair or beard in a long time.  One day, a kindly police officer takes him to the station to let him know that the man convicted of killing Dwight's parents is being released.

We learn later that Dwight disappeared shortly after his parents were killed and hasn't been seen in years by his family or friends.  In this small budget film we see a revenge film at its most basic.  Dwight doesn't turn into Charles Bronson or Liam Neeson.  In fact he's the antithesis.  He's shy, reserved, cautious and easily frightened.  He's also determined to kill the man responsible for his parent's death.

The blue car, as the title suggests, is a character itself in the film.  Clearly, the car at some point was used for target practice.  Numerous bullet holes appear everywhere.  Scraping together what little money he has, he puts a battery back in the car, pumps up the tires and heads out to the prison with little more than determination.

Conceived on a minimal budget by director/writer/cameraman Jeremy Saulnier, the film has a taut, profound element of conviction.  Probably just like the filmmaker.  The actors are mostly unknown.  I did recognize Amy Hargreaves from TV's ""Homeland"" who plays Dwight's sister, Sam and Devin Ratray from numerous TV shows who plays Dwight's childhood friend.  The film has some raw elements as Dwight's initial focus has to expand beyond just one man.  This is a sometimes frightening and sometimes humorous revenge tale unlike anything you might see from the genre.  Recommended.

The Blu ray transfer includes a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Certainly there are limitations with the source material but overall the transfer looks pretty good.  Black levels could be better, but the detail is very good.  Flesh tones appear natural, color and hues are fine.  The film uses a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track and like the video, won't overwhelm the viewer but at the same time is perfectly fine.  The surrounds come into play primarily with some of the scenes involving gunfire as well as some outdoor ambient elements.  The LFE rarely comes into play.  The dialog is perfectly clear.  Overall, very good sonic support.  Subtitles are limited to English SDH and Spanish.  Extras include a commentary track by Saulmier and Blair, a making of featurette, a couple deleted scenes and a camera test of various scouting locations.",1428192000,,2740,4.8997821350762525

""Blue Ruin"" was lauded at a lot of Indie competitions, which put it on my radar. I was impressed at great performances from all involved. No big time actors, but all impressive. (Eve Plumb from ""The Brady Bunch"" has a small role, but not as sweet).

The film is filled with flawed people, some evil and some not-so-much, but all compelling. It's not a happy film, but there's a side of life that is there, and most choose to ignore. It's an element of life that shouldn't happen, but could.

Hard to describe, but I was never bored for a minute, mostly because of Blair's totally involved performance. He's no leading man-type, neither handsome or with any discernable personality, but driven with passion and determination. Most impressive.

I liked this character study very much. A class act, from all involved. The twist ending is satisfying, and I'm glad I watched ""Blue Ruin"".

It was interesting to see how the protagonist survived poverty, the strategies that worked for him. also different take on police/homeless dynamic, written with an officer playing against type, which is a nice change in a film.

6391440,5,B00JV0547O,"One of the strongest achievements in recent years in independent cinema is ""Blue Ruin"".  It's brilliantly written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier who just a few years ago was making his own amateur monster movies with his friends, some of whom were involved in this inspired revenge thriller that is the antithesis of the usual commercial revenge thriller.

Shot on a less-than-shoestring budget, it stars Macon Blair (best friend of Saulnier since childhood) as Dwight, an apparent homeless drifter housing a grudge against a convict about to be released from prison whom he feels had murdered his parents.  Dwight is obviously unaccustomed to violence (he's never fired a gun) and, as in the best of the Noir classics, makes one bad decision that plunges him way over his head into a harrowing murder plot that'll keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

What makes this film so unique is how its suspense comes from slow, quiet inexorable tension punctuated with a few acts of violence that seem authentic, bearing none of the sensationalism or tired clichs one gets in garbage like ""Taken"" and its tiresome ilk.  The triumph of ""Blue Ruin"" is even greater when one realizes that its director used his own family house and his family car making it, and managed such a height of verisimilitude by using cinema in its purest form.  Here an 'amateur' outdoes the Hollywood pros in making a superb virtually perfect thriller that won't easily be forgotten.",1424390400,,1456,4.922448979591837
6391441,5,B00JV0547O,"When you practically open your film with a homeless man stabbing another man in the face in a public restroom, you pretty much set yourself up for one of those expected crazy horror-type movies, and so within the first twenty minutes or so of Blue Ruin I was, wholly, anticipating some sort of Rob Zombie, homeless man on a rampage, blood soaked yet entirely forgettable and pointless lesson on gore and how to coat every frame with it.

Yeah, Blue Ruin is not that kind of movie.

That isn't to say that Blue Ruin isn't a terrifying film, but it is a smart kind of terrifying, a film that understands the strength of subtlety, and despite a pretty abrasive and blunt opening (like, that bathroom scene is remarkably intense), it shows so much restraint in the building of each moment that the bigger moments truly explode with impact.  This is one of those films that makes good on the slow burn, allowing us to soak in the anticipation of the inevitable and then, it just takes your breath away.

Like I said, Blue Ruin opens with a bang.  For the first ten minutes or so we pretty much watch a homeless man, in silence, go about his every day; bathing in the homes of strangers, rummaging trash for food, sleeping in his rusty heap of a carand then hes approached by a police officer, who is obviously a friend, and then handed a newspaper and next thing we know, this man, now identified as Dwight, stabs a man in the face in a bathroom and then leaves, but he leaves behind him a trail, a trail that he needs to get rid of.

And then the story gaps start to fill in.

Dwights parents were murdered ten years ago.  This basically sent Dwight into a depression that wrecked him to the point where he became a nomad, a wandering homeless man with no connections to his former life, including his sister who has done her best to move on and is now married with children.  The newspaper reported on the release of the parents murderer, and the man Dwight killed in the bathroom was, to his knowledge, the man responsible for his overbearing pain.  But its not that simple, and its not that clear.  You see, this is a story about family, about vengeance and about some really messed up stuff, and with an unreported murder, it became clear that Dwights act of vengeance was not about to go unnoticed.  No, even more vengeance was in the air, and the trail Dwight left, unfortunately, led back to his sister.  Intent on ending things before they went that far, Dwight sends his sister away and holes up in his sisters house waiting for things to happen.

And then they happenand continue to happen.

I don't want to say much more, plot-wise, because the way that Jeremy Saulnier builds this film is so incredible that you need to see this to appreciate it.  I have never been this nervous watching a film.  It doesnt hurt that Macon Blair (a completely new face/name to me) is completely in this every step of the way.  His development of character is remarkable, and his depiction of grief, destitution, anger and pain is uncanny.  The way his eyes well up when he sees the man he loathes released from prison, the way he stares, blank and weary, after his initial actionsthe way he cuts that arrow out of his leg!  My god, he sells it so hard.

Some may consider Blue Ruin just your typical thriller, and in some respects theyd be right.  There is nothing new here, story-wise.  Its not some incredibly intelligent film, but it is a brilliantly constructed film.  Sometimes it isn't about the story you're telling but the way you tell that story, and Saulnier and Blair tell this story brilliantly.

6391469,5,B00JV0547O,"This is a straightforward and emotionally engaging story about violence and vengeance, and beneath the cityscapes and semi-automatic rifles it has the timelessness of myth. It manages to create sympathy for a troubled, asocial protagonist in Dwight Evans, a young man whose life went off the rails following the murder of his parents. His aimless existence as a homeless man scavenging his meals from dumpsters comes to a sudden end when he learns that the man who killed his mother and father is going to be released.

Even with the wild hair and grizzled beard that actor Macon Blair cultivated for his role as Evans, there is a gentle innocence and sensitivity evident in his boyish features and huge eyes. There is pain there, too, and behind that, the rage and suffering that is burning him up from the inside. Evans goes about his bloody mission with a fearless incompetence, and is completely unprepared when his actions ignite a feud that threatens to destroy not just him, but his sister and two nieces as well. Dwight hasn't spoken with his sister in years, and his haphazard plans for revenge fail to account for the Old Testament cycle of endless reprisals he might trigger; killing a member of this outlaw clan puts a target on his sister's back, and Evans is now in a war he has little chance of winning.

'Blue Ruin' has an archetypal story at its core, but the narrative moves with a realistic, idiosyncratic pace. The dialogue has an authentic feel, and so does the violence. People die in the shocking, graceless, sometimes anticlimactic way they do in the real world, and it's often a dumb mistake that divides the living and the dead. This is a brilliant film, and writer-director Jeremy Saulnier deserves all the acclaim and accolades he's received; the fact that this was a Kickstarter project justifies the entire program, in my opinion. The only criticism I can make is occasional predictability, but even that seems like as much a positive as a negative, reinforcing the grim, tragic themes and atmosphere of inevitable doom that hangs over the picturesque squalor of rural Virginia. Dwight Evans is like an automaton, following his ancient programming, completely powerless to avoid the violent collisions he knows are ahead. But Saulnier invests the film with a low-key humor that helps mute the fatalistic dissonance, and somehow keeps what might have been an oppressively dark story from driving a percentage of the audience to public weeping or suicide. Macon Blair is perfect for his role, and steps inside Dwight Evans like a bespoke suit. He is the exact opposite of the self-assured underwear-model types that end up in Hollywood, and he brings a look, intelligence, and strange gamma-male charisma that is truly unique. For every George Clooney or Brad Pitt there's a Steve Buscemi or William H. Macy, and I hope he brings his talents to bear on other films as well. That might have sounded like an insult disguised as praise, but I think Blair deserves Oscar consideration for this role. If you're sensitive to violence, and try to avoid realistic depictions of the hideous damage that bullets and blades can do, you might find 'Blue Ruin' disturbing. For everyone else, I recommend it highly.",1417564800,19,3229,4.912087912087912

6391477,4,B00JV0547O,"A low-budget study of payback and retribution, Blue Ruin relates the tale of Dwight Evans (effectively played by Macon Blair), a homeless man, who, when he is informed that the guy who killed his parents has just been released on parole, decides to take matters into his own hands, making it his mission to bring the killer to justice - Dwight Evans style.

With his pale complexion, slight build and weak chin, Evans is hardly your average revenge-melodrama protagonist. This works wholly in the films favor, since it strips the material of the slickness that would undoubtedly accompany this story were it produced by a mainstream studio.

Writer/director/photographer Jeremy Saulnier gets by with a bare minimum of plotting, dialogue and characterization, but the overall spareness drives home the theme of the ugliness and senselessness of violence when used as a means to solve lifes problems. The detached, matter-of-fact, almost antiseptic way in which the movie portrays bloodshed only further drives home that point.

Its virtues do, however, come at a bit of a price. The drama often feels under-baked and undernourished, leaving many in the audience to feel a trifle slighted in the end. Still, thats a small enough complaint in face of the movies many undeniable virtues.

Living in a wreck of a car and breaking into holidaymakers homes for a wash; he dines out of trash cans. Then the local police bring him news that shakes him from his cathartis. He has been so badly wronged in the past that his life derailed. The author of his downfall has now been released early from prison. He makes a decision to seek vengeance.

This means going back to the familial home he has abandoned. Once there he sets in motion a chain of events that will build up its own momentum, essentially driven by vengeance, family loyalty and pure emotion.

Dwight is played by Macon Blair, who has not had too many good roles until now. He excels as the frightened, yet driven man, who is essentially a good person, who has been forced into the role of vigilante avenger. He is able to convey so much tormented emotion in his facial expressions and the use of his eyes that his performance on its own would make this a 5 star film. All of the supporting actors are also excellent, but his performance just dwarfs all around him.

This is edge of seat stuff, with proper violence - though far from gratuitous, it is the messy sort, the way it happens in real life and not stylised and glammed up for the movies. It has a brooding quality that makes the whole thing have a kind of effervescence that just grabs you by the hand and takes you along for the ride - and that means the whole journey.

6391490,5,B00JV0547O,"Jeremy Saulnier's BLUE RUIN is one of those films that comes along maybe once or twice a year that makes you wish that other filmmakers were making more films like this. BLUE RUIN, and its star Macon Blair, take the revenge thriller and give it a whole new kind of style and a whole new kind of protagonist.

Dwight (Blair) is a disheveled but clever homeless man living out of a decrepit sky-blue Pontiac Bonneville near a fairground along the Virginia shoreline. One day, a local police officer brings him back to the station to let him know that ""he's being released"". The he referred to here is Wade Cleland, the man imprisoned for the murder of Dwight's parents. He puts his Bonneville back in working order and follows Wade and his family to a bar where he murders Wade. He makes a hasty, fumbling escape, leaving behind the Bonneville, and heads to see his sister Sam (Amy Hargreaves) as seemingly the man he once was; no longer disheveled but clean shaven and respectable-looking. He confesses that he killed Wade, and she is initially glad, but any gratification they might receive turns to dread as Dwight remembers that not only has the murder not made the news, but the Bonneville is still registered to her. He has her take herself and her young children out of town as he awaits the Cleland family and their ""in-house"" assault on her home. He survives by the skin of his teeth, takes another Cleland brother Teddy (Kevin Kolack) hostage and goes to visit an old friend Ben (Devin Ratray) who was in the army in hopes of obtaining a gun. All the while, a full-blown confrontation between Dwight and the rest of the criminal Cleland family becomes increasingly inevitable, culminating in one of the most intense climaxes you'll see in a film this year.

Rather than go down the path that Hollywood has taken with revenge thrillers over the last several years, where the protagonist is a righteous crusader or a former military type with a ""special set of skills"", Saulnier smartly subverts the expectations of the genre and makes the single-minded protagonist a slightly unstable, nervous, and utterly NORMAL person. Dwight's strength as a protagonist is how incredibly banal he is. He has no training, no strong or imposing physicality, and seems utterly incompetent for the task he's set for himself. And in this form, Macon Blair gives such an incredibly strong and memorable performance, and gives Dwight much more depth than one might expect. One of the best observations made by another person about what Dwight is doing is by Ben, when he tells him, without judgment, that what he's doing might be right, but it's ugly. BLUE RUIN is not a film afraid to drive that point home. There is a Nietzcheian quality to Dwight's quest. He isn't fully aware that what he's doing isn't totally justifiable until the violence becomes increasingly shocking. And when the climax approaches, he no longer has any qualms about what he's doing, and feels even more justified, but also feels how utterly pointless the quest has become.

Saulnier does triple-duty here writing, shooting and directing the film, and gives its primarily rural settings a stark and unforgiving realism, but still allowing him stylistic flairs, such as the constant motif of using a blue color pallette. Many objects are blue like the Bonneville, the light from a flashlight, the moon above a lake, flashes of lightning; it all works to give a sense of extreme melancholy and even tragedy to the film. He delivers the film at a great pace, barely giving the audience time to breathe before things become dark again. The only complaint I might have about the film is that Dwight is a character I would have liked to have spent more time with in the presence of others. The film drops hints about his character, but just enough to potentially fill in some blanks. But that's more of a personal preference rather than a real problem I had with the film.

BLUE RUIN is not only an astounding and realistic revenge drama driven by an incredible performance, but it is one of those films that anyone who complains about the lack of originality in modern film should be watching.",1412294400,,4151,4.777158774373259

The movie is a thriller from beginning to end. The protagonist type is one you don't see too often: meek and insecure, motivated by conflicting passions, instead of the Bruce Willis or Jason Statham archetypes - I loved seeing this novel type on screen.

Aside from one or two scenes, I thought the movie was moderately plausible regarding the characters' motivations and actions.

All in all, amazing thriller that took me by surprise.",1410912000,,577,4.637254901960785
6391502,5,B00JV0547O,"I went into this film with very little knowledge... like I enter all things, with very little knowledge... I only knew that it was a revenge tale, that the director had cashed in his wifes retirement to pay for it and Sundance who had initially rejected the film later went on to say that rejection was a mistake. Those scrappy underdog stories always capture my imagination but its seldom the films live up to the folklore that builds up around them. Blue Ruin not only lives up to the lore, it transcends it. You will forget about the stories surrounding the making of the film/release of the film and accept the movie for what it is, a masterpiece.

This is an honest look at revenge. We all like to imagine if we set out on a path of revenge we would react and act like Liam Neeson in Taken but the truth is most of us would act like Dwight in Blue Ruin. We would make mistakes and hurt the wrong people, leave behind evidence and do countless other things that would never make the cut in a Luc Besson picture.

I'm not sure that giving away the plot details of this film would have any impact on your enjoyment but because it is so sparse when it comes to plot I'll avoid revealing anything more than I already have. Just know that this film is raw and at times brutal in its execution. The film is also a testament to how far digital film making has come. Blue Ruin was made on a shoestring budget but it looks very polished. Ten years ago a film made on this budget would have looked far worse.

We are in the middle of an independent film renaissance and film makers like Jeremy Sauliner are reminding us that not all films need to be retreads of tired subjects, that directors and writers with unique voices should be celebrated and supported.

6391511,5,B00JV0547O,"I popped the DVD in for the movie BLUE RUIN having no idea what to expect. Sure I'd seen the trailer for the movie on the front of several other DVDs, but it had never played in theaters locally and with no major star power I thought it would just be another by the book independent mystery. I was wrong. I found myself drawn into the story, a story that I'd never seen done on film before, a tale of revenge that didn't end when it was exacted.

The movie opens with Dwight, a homeless man living from his car by the beach, combing the nearby area to survive. He sifts through garbage cans for food, picks up discarded bottles to exchange for cash and picks up coins dropped along the road. Unshaven and long haired, Dwight could be down on his luck or just someone who dropped out of the rush of everyday life. We have no idea what his story is. That all changes and is slowly revealed when a police officer picks him up, takes him to the station and informs him that someone is being released from prison. We might hear a name but still have no clue what is going on.

Dwight returns to his car and drives off from the beach. He finds a dive where we witness several men enter from a car he's been following. Dwight goes into the bathroom of the bar and waist with a knife in his hand. When one of the men enters, Dwight attacks him and fatally stabs him to death. Leaving he steals the limo the men were riding in as they emerge from the bar with the hopes of catching him. And still, we're just not sure what's going on.

Next we witness the transformation of Dwight from the derelict he was to the timid looking man he becomes. This is a return to his reality. He meets with a woman we discover is his sister and they talk about the release of the man, the man that Dwight then informs her he has killed. She's happy he's done so but then they discuss the fact that it has put her and her daughter in danger. They return to her place and Dwight sends her to stay elsewhere while he waits. Soon after dark two men show and attempt to kill Dwight. Instead he kills wounds one and the other escapes. Taking the wounded man hostage, Dwight sets out to the home of a friend, a friend with access to guns who will help him.

I could continue but I won't for the simple reason that this movie needs to be seen rather than talked about from start to finish. You should have the chance to find out why Dwight acted as he did, why the family of the man he kills decides to find their own justice rather than call the police and to see what the final outcome of the movie is. This is a revenge film, plain and simple, and yet it doesn't feel plain or simple at all. It seems to have so much going on at all times that you feel compelled to watch until the credits roll. While it may seem strange to use these words considering the amount of blood spilled in this film, it was a joy to watch as the story unfolded.

The extras make the film even more fascinating as we hear how two childhood friends decided long ago to make this movie. While they didn't both get into show business, director Jeremy Saulnier did become a cinematographer. Using his experience and finding funding from as many sources as possible, he and Macon Blair (who stars as Dwight) stuck to their dream of getting this film made. Even though so many told them it would never happen they did it. Not only that, after being turned down by the Sundance Film Festival they took the film to Cannes where it became a huge hit.

The funniest story found in the extras concerned how they convinced actress Amy Hargreaves to be in the film. When they began putting together the film they started their own Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) page for it featuring still shots of Blair as Dwight. Hargreaves checked the IMDB page on the movie and thought he looked interesting and that the movie could be a good part. In essence she was conned into making the picture by looking at stills from a non-existent movie at that point.

Every once in a while you find a movie that catches you off guard and presents something new that actually works. BLUE RUIN was that sort of movie for me. It offered a fresh take on the revenge movie, had compelling characters and surprised me on several occasions, one of which made me almost jump from my seat it was so unexpected. While the only big name in the film is Eve Plumb (yes of THE BRAYD BUNCH fame) in a minor cameo role, the acting is top notch here. If you're looking for something different than by all means watch this film. It's one I know I'll pull down from the shelf now and then to watch another time.",1409356800,,4608,4.2534246575342465
6391512,5,B00JV0547O,A simple premise executed perfectly. This is independent filmmaking at its best. The suspense is like a rubber band wound too tight...and then it breaks.,1409270400,,153,5.16
6391513,4,B00JV0547O,"Now and then a movie comes along that , though the plot isn't new, is handled with such a unique approach, it just plain feels new.

Here's the scoop. Since the murder of his two parents Dwight has fallen off the grid. He lives in his car and has a routine down pat. He takes decent enough care of himself with the minimum amount of resources and effort. Now the word is out that his parents' murderer is being released from prison and revenge is in the air. But not all is as it seems and things don't go quite as planned.

This is all but typical. Revenge flicks are a staple part of film history but this one involves the common man. He's not ex-Navy Seal or special ops. He's the guy down the street with no particular skills in exacting violent revenge. Doo-doo hits the fan and he needs to use his wiles to improvise and get to the next stage. It's him and these little details that keeps the viewer involved. Dwight even looks like a schlub. He is the last person you'd figure to inject himself into this situation.

This is a nifty flick. It has a lot of unique twists and turns in the plotting. Macon Blair does a sweet job as Dwight but all the actors do a stand-up job. I also like the way it was shot. It's by no means Hollywood glossy but it's lensed well enough to not look like a student film, and the shots are set up to give the editor plenty to work with and keep the movement smooth. There are some generally tense scenes and a couple of gruesome effects. One, involving an arrow had me turning my head. The finale was also pretty tense. It made me want to know more about the family Dwight set himself against. Unfortunately I was not able to hear the final words uttered in the film so I don't know how they lent themselves to the overall.

This is about as good a revenge flick you will ever see. By any standard this is worth climbing to the top of your 'to watch"" list. And at a crisp 90 minutes, it won't strain your time budget.",1409184000,,1954,4.1888297872340425
6391514,4,B00JV0547O,"This film has been dubbed as a classic ""revenge movie,"" but I take issue with that description. It's more of a ""feud movie"" than a ""revenge movie,"" because the revenge in question takes place in the first 30 minutes of the film, and the rest of the film deals with its aftermath.

Our unlikely hero, Dwight, who drops his keys at the scene of the crime and misses at point blank range with firearms, is rather messily entangled with the Cleland family, a surly group with rural inclinations and suggestions of poverty, sort of a modern day Hatfield or McCoy clan. One of them murdered both his parents one night while he was in high school, and upon his release from prison, Dwight fears that he or his ex-wife will be targeted for sending him there, so he follows him after his release and stabs him to death in a dive bar restroom. The rest of what plays out is gritty, intense, grinding, and inevitable, and quite compelling to watch.

The feud plays out in a cat-and-mouse game of attack and counterattack, with home invasions, kidnapping, stalking, all that good stuff of which I am so terrified. It's no wonder I didn't come away from this movie as a nervous wreck. I guess it helps that none of my family has ever murdered anyone. The conflict builds to a titanic confrontation at the Cleland home, where Dwight lies in wait for the rest of the family to return. This part is tense and well-acted, and resolved in a heart-wrenching way that entirely fits the theme of the movie. There's even a little twist afterward, hearkening back to the opening of the film, that brings things full circle and wraps them up.

Overall I have to say this is an excellent low-key ""feud movie,"" and give it a thumbs up, with four stars out of five.",1409097600,,1738,4.511111111111111

6391516,3,B00JV0547O,"I have mix feelings about this movie. After only viewing it once, I came to a conclusion that maybe this is one of those movies that should be watched more then once, because seeing it once might be confusing to some.  The plot is somewhat oblique. There is no soundtrack except for one song that is played in the middle of the movie and at the end when the credits start rolling. It is actually a pretty good song, and definitely a wise choice to highlight the meaning of the movie. As to the meaning of the movie or message, I think the strongest one can be asked in a from of a question: Is revenge (by means of violence) the best way to resolve a conflict? Does it solve anything? as the old Hammurabi excerpt says ""A tooth for a tooth"".  Is there any sense in Hammurabi's ancient law of justice? The movie also highlights and reminds us of the gun violence that has deep roots in American culture dating back to 19th century.  It is definitely a good movie, but is a  sleeper that one needs to pay attention to at all times.  Otherwise, it will either put you to sleep or bore you to death.  To sum it up, Blue Ruin (2013) is an indie production that reminded me of Out of the Furnace from the same year.  However, with the later one being much more entertaining.  Watch this film at your own risk. I give it 3 solid stars for its authenticity and un-Hollywood like (real-life) characters.",1408924800,2,1394,4.314176245210728
6391517,5,B00JV0547O,"Big fat wow. Talk about a suspenseful thriller and edge of your seat perfection. This is done masterfully in an independent way. This is how you make a movie. This is how you direct a film. This is how you complete a film that will leave a lasting impression upon the viewer. I speak of none other than Blue Ruin, truly something that I will remember. This is going on my top list of 2014, no doubt whatsoever. A stunning example of independent perfection.

Flawlessly acted. Breathtakingly dramatic. Awesomely created through actions, through suspense, through a reality-based feel. A normal person can relate to this character named Dwight. Average people can understand this character, can feel like you are a part of his reality and thought process. The character of Dwight is so thought out and flawlessly performed and executed.

An awesome haunting music score to go along with the equal unique atmosphere of the film. A mystery surrounds a homeless man named Dwight. Approached by local police to tell him the news that double murderer is being released from prison. This killer holds the key to Dwight's sanity and reality of living yet not-living.

This is director Jeremy Saulnier's second film and he has such a talent and a stunning approach at film-making that it floors me. Blue Ruin is truly a magical film of cinema making. A thriller that needs nothing added. This also was written by Jeremy Saulnier. Perfectly directed and perfectly written. This is Crime American at its best. Think early Coen Brothers or early Tarantino.

The stars someone that I feel mastered his part. Macon Blair who plays Dwight is why I love cinema. His performance is Oscar worthy and something to be remembered. He aced this role and I have to say what an actor. What a part. A flawless example of acting perfection.

The whole cast is golden. Amy Hargreaves is amazing and truly believable in her role. All the players shine in these parts. Devin Ratray is amazing in the part of Ben. He aced the no questions asked type friend. The friend that responds:  ""I'll do whatever for you buddy"" or better yet Its better I not know.""

After Dwight seeks revenge and his ultimate justice; his plan falters and now he realizes the struggle he is about to go through.

Unpredictable, astonishing, brilliant and ultimately excellent. Twist and turns. A thick mystery and suspense. An average everyday person taking on and taking out the garbage. Loved the fear and the edge, this film takes.

Truly one of the greatest indie films I have seen in a very long time. Hollywood has nothing on this golden ticket. This has all the perfection of a tight woven dramatic revenge film and true masterpiece of independent film-making. This takes away all the crappy hype and commercialism that is Hollywood and gives the true bare bones of perfection and ultimate realism.

What's so enjoyable about this film is Dwight is like the average person. The viewer can relate to Dwight. He is an average person stuck in an uncontrollable situation. An average person. Not a cold blooded assassin. So therefore the mistakes happens and the control of the situation is amateurish, making it all the more reality based and believable.

This is one film that should be seen and praised for its crime story feel. This has an early unique pioneering way to it. It feels fresh and new and the persona of revenge, justice, secrets and lies grace this film. I speck highly of this amazing experience. I highly recommend it.

6391524,5,B00JV0547O,"This is a bare-bones revenge thriller. There are no evil villains or grand speeches that explain the story. It's simply the story of a guy who wants to get revenge on the man who killed his parents. SPOILER ALERT: And he gets that revenge. In the first fifteen minutes of the movie. The rest of the film is about the repercussions of this act of vengeance  -- how our guy deals with the fact that, now, the family of that dead guy wants revenge.

Made for a VERY modest budget, the filmmakers give the genre a subtle twist to make this a fresh and fun adventure in killing someone who's done you wrong. It looks at all the players in this tale (dead and alive) and shows the vicious cycle that arises when people don't get what they consider to be ""justice."" all of this plays out on a realistic stage that could be happening in the next town over from you or me. From the acting to the cinematography to the sound design, everything is top notch -- rare for the indie film world.

If that sounds boring to you, don't worry. There is oodles of tension and plenty of violence sprinkled throughout because our guy is definitely NOT good when it comes to the revenge business. At every turn, he has to deal with not just angry folks armed with shotguns and crossbows but his own ineptitude.

Dwight seemingly doesn't have all his marbles, but he's motivated by revenge and goes on the road to get it. Sadly things go horribly wrong and this morality tale/suspense thriller kicks into high gear. Dwight is an amateur when it comes to ghastly deeds. Soon his sister and her family are at risk. With the help of a high school pal, Dwight ups his game, but only ends up in a worse position.

What I liked most about this movie was the fantastic portrayal of Dwight. All the nuance and subtlety was there without running down the usual Hollywood tropes. This is a simple plot, but it was carried perfectly by the actors and director, who had a clear vision for what the audience sees. Most important, it shows the futility of vengeful motives that do nothing but perpetuate tragedy with more tragedy.

This is one of the best dramatic thrillers to come about in a long time, one that practices a great deal of restraint to display so many grim realities involving, violence, grief, hatred, and revenge, without ever becoming indulgent or preachy.

What's more important is how this story plays out, and boy is it worth it. This film had some of the most tense scenes I've seen this year, and made you really feel the fear that this amateur assassin feels as he carries out his task. I thought that the performances were all very natural and pleasant to watch. The only actor I recognized was Devin Ratray (Buzz in HOME ALONE 1 & 2), but all of the performers did an excellent job in my opinion. What impressed me the most, however, was the way in which information was communicated to the audience with little to no dialogue. The first 10-15 minutes are mostly dialogue-free, and a good portion of the character development for Dwight happens simple actions or facial expressions. I'll close this out by ruminating a bit on the meaning of the title. After wondering what it could mean, I came to a rather simple conclusion that can have a deeper meaning, I suppose, if you want it to have one. Blue Ruin can refer to the Pontiac Bonneville that Dwight drives throughout the film. However, blue seemed to also be a recurring visual motif throughout the film as well, and ruin is certainly something that comes to everybody involved in this tragic story. Overall, I thought this was a well-acted, thrilling and tense story that did rely a little too much on mood, but also had some worthy character work as well. One of the best this year so far.",1406505600,3,1703,4.496774193548387

Dwight seems like a crazy homeless man when the movie begins. He soon kills a man named Wade because he holds Wade responsible for the murders of his parents. Perhaps Dwight committed an act of vengeance, or perhaps he thought Wade, who had just been released from prison, would kill him next. Was Dwight weak? Blue Ruin lets the viewer decide.

Dwight's actions set in motion a chain of reactions. Wade's brothers, having their own thirst for vengeance, come to the home of Dwight's sister. What is Dwight to do?

Most revenge movies are long on action and short on intelligent thought. This one has several short moments of brutality and longer stretches of escalating tension during which the viewer is invited to think about the difficult choices Dwight had made.

6391566,5,B00JV0547O,"BLUE RUIN is one of the most intriguing, offbeat thrillers that Ive seen in some time.  Although the plots are totally different, its tone reminds me of BLOOD SIMPLE, the first movie from the Coen Brothers.

Like that minor classic, which featured Frances McDormand in her first film role, BLUE RUIN has some possibly familiar faces from television in its cast, but no names.  Indeed, unknown leading man Macon Blair is the best friend of writer-director-cinematographer Jeremy Saulnier.

Blair is not your typical hero of a revenge thriller.  Hes not an ex-C.I.A. operative or a Navy Seal.  Hes a homeless nerd; lost since his parents were murdered years ago.  Now, upon learning that the killer is about to be released from prison, he sets out to avenge his folks.  Unfortunately, his act sets off a chain reaction that pits one family against the other.

Working with a bare bones budget, some of which was raised via Kickstarter,  Saulnier has fashioned a suspenseful, violent, surprise-filled and stunningly photographed film that grabs the audiences attention from the outset and holds it for the ninety minute running time.  The superb, virtually unheard of cast includes Devin Ratray,  Amy Hargreaves and Eve Plumb.

DVD extras for the Anchor Bay Entertainment Blu-ray release include audio commentary by Saulnier and Blair, deleted scenes and a Making of featurette that will certainly inspire young filmmakers hoping to make their own no budget movie.

Not this time, folks.  With Blue Ruin, writer, producer, and director Jeremy Saulnier gets my This Kid Is a Proverbial One To Watch tribute.  The narrative is polished, compelling, and, at times, quite powerful.  I once heard or read an observation about us human beings as story-tellers (novelists, producers):  Paraphrased:  with us, there are maybe less than a dozen stories.  Love, revenge, war, crime, justice denied, justice served.  One of those has just gotta be An Ordinary Man With The Snot Beat Out Of Him Becomes Remarkable. And damned lucky.  Like the old cowboy said ""I'd rather have a little luck than all the ability in the world.""
Mr Saulnier has written such a story with high quality, and directed a film altogether up to the task of screening that tale.

Actor Macon Blair as lead got him some chops, playing that Ordinary Man with skill, a man described by his own sister as ""weak.""  And Blair well captures that attribute, an incompetent close to a doom which brings out of him what I believe we all have if given a place and a time which demands it:  gallantry.

Plus, we get to meet Ben, Blair's high school buddy of sizable proportion, with his camo bib overalls, rural homestead, and more than adequately stocked gun cabinet.  I sure like me some Big Ben and I hope you do, too.  It's nice to have friends like Ben.

When he learns that his parents' murderer has been released from prison after serving a 20-year bid, he uses what little money he can muster to hunt down the ex-con responsible for destroying his life.

Dwight Evans (Macon Blair) abandons his existence of relative peace in exchange for the chance to kill the man that killed his Mom and Dad. His child-like eyes are windows to his tortured mind, and are glazed with fear--not unlike a deer stuck in headlights. Quiet, contemplative, and dead-set on killing Wade Cleland, Jr., the man convicted of killing Dwight's parents. Macon's acting is top-notch for such a low-rent thriller.

The supporting cast is passable, and is the film's weak spot. The other actors never rise above the cusp of mediocrity. The climax comes too soon, and is a bit of a letdown as well.

He is our antagonist protagonist in a different sort of crime drama. It seems Dwight's has not been able to move on after Wade Cleland shot and killed his parents.

Upon finding out that Wade has been released from prison, this sets off an odd family feud with a minor twist of past events.

Macon Blair played an interesting, yet unexciting Dwight. The story line is different from the typical formula which is what makes the film interesting. However, there were numerous boring scenes like Dwight being informed, eating a sandwich with his sister, or walking along the beach. How about a flashback scene to make Dwight's current life seem realistic?

6391580,4,B00JV0547O,"In retrospect it was a good idea to revisit Jeremy Saulnier's Blue Ruin after taking in Spike Lee's Oldboy remake and the mediocre Out of the Furnace. All would fall into the ""revenge thriller"" category, but there's very little about Blue Ruin that feels familiar. Instead it takes our concept of the revenge movie and uses that as a springboard to something new and unbearably tense, where the ""hero's"" journey for vengeance isn't something to be cheered on, but is instead something to be feared.

The genius of Blue Ruin is that it doesn't simply grant us the ""wish fulfillment"" aspect inherent in every movie of this genre. That's the easy part; but what Saulnier does is thrust us headlong into the real-world repercussions such violence spawns. When we first meet Dwight (Macon Blair), he's a haggard shell of a man; skinny and ghostly, living out of his car like an aimless drifter. Something awful has clearly broken him; there's a sadness and terror behind his eyes that never goes away. While the locals obviously don't take kindly to him breaking into their homes to use the bath, the police are surprisingly forgiving; suggesting that whatever happened to Dwight was something truly heinous. We learn that his parents were murdered some time ago; setting him on the path of vagrancy he now seems mired in. But when he learns that the killer is about to be released from prison, all Dwight can think of is payback.

From there the film goes everywhere one least expects it to, staying light enough on its feet to shift gears on a spinning dime. Dwight's quest for retribution ends rather early on, but neither he nor we are allowed long to celebrate this Pyrrhic victory. Instead that's where the story kicks into another direction entirely as Dwight comes to realize that violence only begets more violence, and revenge is a most cyclical beast. He's not a hardened killer or a tactician in any sense of the word; Dwight is an ordinary guy, and a fairly soft one at that. And when he screws up the implications could be terrible, not just for him but for the few people he remains close to. The true power of Blue Ruin is its ability to find tension in the little things, not showy acts of violence. Saulnier creates an ominous atmosphere that permeates your bones; the cinematography is simple and stark; and he even finds clever ways to inject humor (mainly through Dwight's war vet buddy played by Devin Ratray) without going overboard into full-blown comedy, which it easily could have.

Although they say very different things about the nature of revenge and justice, Blue Ruin deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the original Oldboy.  In his sophomore feature, Saulnier has created a fierce, powder keg of a thriller that marks him as a filmmaker with an extremely bright future.",1400976000,,2808,4.771604938271605

Other times I watch a movie so good I cannot relax until I can post something about how good it is.

Blue Ruin is in the latter.

It would be easy to compare this to a Coen Brothers Movie, but I think it should stand on it's own.

For starters the Director  Jeremy Saulnier is also the Writer and Cameraman, how he pulled that off and got the result he did is nothing short of amazing.

Dwight is a guy who apparently lives on the beach and eats out of dumpsters and seems to be happy doing it, he gets some news and suddenly his world turns upside down.

It will take a while before you understand exactly is what Dwight is obsessed with, but during that time you will see a pretty good movie.

Dwight tracks down some people and hides himself in a bathroom stall, he is apparently horrified about his situation and covers his mouth to control his gasping for air. Dwight is meek, until it is time to use the knife, and then he is no longer meek.

Without revealing too much to whoever is reading this, I will tell you that everything that happens after this builds slowly and expertly to a great crescendo which eventually will let you understand everything.

All of the performances are five star acts, Macon Blair is one hell of an actor to pull the job he had portraying Dwight, Devin Ratray follows up his fantastic performance in Nebraska with another rock solid show here.

Devin is fast becoming in my opinion the finest supporting actor out there and I can see a John Goodman like career for him.

Don't expect a transformation into an ex-Special Agent who can kill with the flick of a wrist. He is sometimes resourceful, sometimes tragically inept, sometimes lucky, but always in way over his head. He knows it, but carries on the best he can. This gives the film much of its tension, as he tries to deal with each escalating situation. We know the car won't be the only ruin by the end of the film.

6391603,4,B00JV0547O,"I'm tempted call this a ""blue collar revenge"" movie, and by no means is this an insult. What I mean is, it seems like revenge movies nowadays feature the hero as some kind of special, ex-military/spy/cop figure who turns out to be more than a match for the bad guys. Blue Ruin, on the other hand, presents a character, Dwight, who is the exact opposite of that--you could almost label him a ""loser."" He's resourceful, but he makes mistakes; he has a plan, but there's no special trick he pulls to accomplish things.

Blue Ruin also plays with the whole idea of revenge and what it requires/takes from you. There's a lot of gray in the characters and the story itself, so while you want Dwight to succeed, you also find yourself wishing there was another way for him to do so. Instead of rooting for the ""bad guys"" to die, it's more like ""why does this have to happen?""

There are some shortcomings, but overall, I found it a tense, beautifully shot movie that's different and creative and from what you're used to.",1399334400,,1014,4.505434782608695

6391605,5,B00JV0547O,"""Blue Ruin"", directed by Jeremy Saulnier, is a low-budget, award-winning thriller that develops Hatfield-McCoy related themes of revenge and violence.  Elliptical and spare, the film builds its tension throughout. The film features Saulnier's lifelong friend from the Washington, D.C. suburbs, Macon Blair, as the leading character, Dwight, who speaks relatively little during the film.  Blair captures his character with gestures, movement, dress, and his hauntingly expressive eyes.

When the film opens, Dwight is homeless and leads the life of a beach bum while sleeping in his beat-up blue Bonneville. His life receives a bizarre form of purpose when he learns that the killer of his parents has been released from jail. Dwight's life suddenly becomes meaningful as he sets off to find and exact revenge on the killer. He has an intensity of purpose but little aptitude. He manages to kill his nemesis with a knife early in the film and then plunges into a feud to the death with the family of his victim, the Clelands. Dwight changes from a dirty, disheveled, bearded beach bum, to a clean-shaven, modestly dressed, and softly well-spoken would-be killer. The film includes a great deal of raw, painful violence, including a scene in which Dwight is struck by a cross-bow. Far from a polished killer, Dwight muddles through with many mistakes and errors in judgment.

The film builds up a great deal of sympathy for Dwight and his quest while showing the futility and horror of revenge. His character, and his ineptitude for his chosen task, are developed throughout with emphasis on scenes between Dwight and his sister Kris and between Dwight and his loyal friend Ben who tries to teach Dwight to kill. The movie is set in the lower middle class areas of rural Virginia, with scenes of pawnshops, bars, abandoned railroad tracks, and amusement parks.  The sound track forms an integral part of the film, particularly an ironic song by Little Willie John celebrating the choices the singer has made in a hard life.

A spare, taut and suspenseful noir-style film, ""Blue Ruin"" shows that talent and creativity can make something new from formulaic genres.

6391607,5,B00JV0547O,"The best movie I have seen so far this year.  I've always had a soft spot for the revenge film genre for there are a lot of great ones out there - Dead Man's Shoes, Unforgiven, In the Bedroom and Payback just to name a few.  However and with most revenge films - even good ones - they often lack the realism that makes such films so much more powerful.  Often the characters in such films become ""superheroes"" or like ex-Delta Force/Navy SEAL types when they where supposed to be just an every day Joe.

Of the films I mentioned and one that's in my Top 10 favorites - Unforgiven - is one which it is most like and you can tell was most influenced by.  However, it makes it it's own by having the lead not come from a history of violence but one who driven to the edge by what violence has done to him.

This film portrays revenge as real, sloppy, messy, never goes as planned and is often a lot more complicated than you ever we're led to believe or had yourself believe.

What was interesting though was that there are a lot of dark, intense scenes that are interrupted by humor. Sometimes dark, sometimes just random, but subtle enough that you can either miss it nor is it distracting.  A very impressive feat and something I would compare to and maybe influenced by Tarantino who is one of the rare directors today that can pull this off.

Some graphic violence, some touching scenes, well crafted characters and beautiful cinematography. Keeps you on your toes, keeps you engaged and a lot of foreboding that made it gripping at times. Highly recommend for film geeks who may have liked the other movies I mentioned.",1399161600,,1622,4.434343434343434

6391611,5,B00JV0547O,"With so many huge blockbuster movies already being released in preparation for summer, we often forget about some of the more tense and enthralling stories that are being released on a smaller scale. In this new age where technology is everywhere we turn and movies are at our disposal at all times, most companies have wised up and begun releasing films through platforms like Itunes, Vudu, and Video On Demand. One of the most recent flicks that caught my eye, already picking up steam at this year's Cannes Film Festival, is the riveting new revenge-thriller `Blue Ruin'.

Starring newcomer Macon Blair, it follows a mysterious beach bum who's quiet life is quickly turned upside down by dreadful news. Setting off for his childhood home to carry out an act of vengeance, we see his emotional transformation as he winds up in a ruthless fight to protect his estranged family.

Trust me, as vague as that plot description was, it's the way you should enter the film. With surprises and shocking moments at every corner, you will certainly be glad that it wasn't spoiled. Spellbinding from beginning to end, `Ruin' is unlike any other film you will see all year, and it may be the best. Blair delivers an astounding performance, inhabiting the character at all times, and never letting up for a second.

Do yourself a favor and check this film out, you won't regret it.",1399075200,,1370,4.796610169491525
6391612,5,B00JV0547O,"Well developed plot, well developed character, very well paced and thought out.  ""Blue Ruin"",  the old beater car, is a recurring back drop for a large portion of the film, a sad reminder of what Dwight had lost, and thoughtful comparison to what a wreck his life had become.

I hope in ten years, after this movie is the cult classic it will almost inevitably become, that someone writes dialogue for the car and dubs it into the movie, leaving you wondering just how crazy Dwight really was...

6391620,2,B00JV0547O,"Blue Ruin strains credibility pretty quickly.  It aspires to be a western without the wild wild west setting which can sustain lawless shootouts.  It ultimately comes off as bizarre and pretentious.  It lacks self awareness.  The story is that of a family feud: one family being a hickish backwoods type who kill the parents of a man in a more mainstream suburban family.  The reason for the killing?  Infidelity.  It isn't an act of passion either.  It is a premeditated murder condoned by the whole backwoods family.

To the audience this weird caricature of 'country folk' will rub up against the film's contemporary realistic setting.  Films with this kind of milieu often have villainous families, but they illustrate them as psychopaths completely removed from society---like in horror films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), or as machiavellians with ulterior motives---like in the mob genre (The Sopranos, The Godfather).  In Blue Ruin the violence is merely presented as 'honor killing.'

When asked why he doesn't go to the police, one character says, ""We're doing the same as you, keeping it in house.""  The problem is, the main character isn't seeking a private sense of justice.  He is resorting to it because the 'backwoods family's' killer was released from jail.  That is a credible motive for a killing---an act of revenge.  But the film turns this from a story of one man's revenge to a story about a family rivalry, it loses its 'logos.'

The film wants us to believe this is a long standing Shakespearean family feud---the Montagues and the Capulets, but this is a contemporary setting, not ancient Europe.  It is like, 'lets have a shootout in the Walmart parking lot' kind of a head scratcher.  It is almost wistful and nostalgic in a Tea Party libertarian sense.  Oh wouldn't it be great if we all shot each other over petty interrelational squabbles?  No, that wouldn't make any sense.",1398556800,2,1902,4.955696202531645

6391622,5,B00JV0547O,"In Delaware, a mysterious man, Dwight, leads an itinerant lifestyle.  He sleeps in a car near the beach.  He slips into empty homes during the day to bathe.  He searches the garbage for food.  When he learns a prisoner in Virginia will be freed in the near future, however, he becomes a man of purpose, a man of action.  He begins to drive.  He tries to steal a handgun.  The specific nature of the situation, what is driving our introverted hero toward an act of brutal vengeance, soon comes into focus in Blue Ruin, a dynamite, tightly wound independent suspense film.  Emphasis on ""suspense"" because this is truly a film charged with anxiety, despair, and menace.  Every scene pulsates with uncertainty and the threat of violence, intensified by the fact Dwight is both driven and out of his depth, so we are never sure how he will respond or even whether he will survive.  And the impact is considerable when violence does erupt.  Macon Blair is a quietly engaging lead (his screen presence reminds me of a narcotized, traumatized Zach Galifianakis), and the film tells its grind-house-indebted story of contemporary outlaws and sadistic revenge with a surprising amount of formal elegance and restraint.  A gem.",1398470400,86,1216,4.878048780487805
