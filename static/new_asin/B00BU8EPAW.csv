8573858,5,B00BU8EPAW,"This Blu-ray, which I received a review copy of, is truly unique. It begins with a 15-minute introduction to the first piece, Schoenberg's Pelleas and Melisande. This explains the work's origins and how the musical themes are closely tied to Maurice Maeterlinck's original text. Then, during the performance by the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra led by Claudio Abbado, the viewer is reminded of the themes and the text at the appropriate times. It's certainly educational and enlightening, although some might find it a little distracting.

It's interesting how much this Maeterlinck symbolist play inspired composers. I like all the resulting works very much, although none beats Debussy's masterpiece. Coincidentally, Abbado also performed and recorded not only Debussy's opera but the suite of its themes created by Erich Leinsdorf. It would be interesting to program an evening of music consisting of the Debussy suite and the Faure, Sibelius and Schoenberg versions. Are you listening, Berlin Philharmonic?

The Schoenberg work, composed before he veered off into his 12-note system, is fascinating in its own right, and it's hauntingly played by the orchestra, which features many of Europe's best young musicians. Unless I'm mistaken, several of their faces can be seen -- a bit older -- in Berlin Philharmonic discs from more recent years (the performance captured here is from 2006).

The next work makes a nice pairing, since Schoenberg and Mahler were contemporaries. Here's where I make a confession: Mahler is not one of my favorite composers. I find his music ... busy. I tend to prefer Bruckner's ""cathedral of sound"" approach. It's just a matter of preference.

That said, there's no denying how gorgeous Mahler's Symphony No. 4 sounds here, particularly in the third and fourth movements (the latter featuring soprano Juliane Banse's superb singing). Under Abbado's masterful direction, the orchestra produces a sensitive and fully committed performance that is nothing short of magical. The Vienna audience is obviously mesmerized -- you could hear a pin drop during the quieter passages. At the end, there's quite a long silence before the spell is broken by enthusiastic applause and much stomping.

The technical side of things is equally stellar, although you might be worried initially. The picture quality of the introduction appears to be standard definition, but once the performance starts, the clarity and sharpness of high definition kick in. The sound is excellent as well. I prefer the DTS-HD 5.1 surround-sound option, which is punchier and has a wide dynamic range, but if you stick to the default (PCM Stereo) you'll get a smoother blend, which some might like for these works. You can't go wrong, in other words.",1428451200,,2746,5.260273972602739
8573859,5,B00BU8EPAW,"This disc from 2006, made shortly before the later 2009 Lucerne Festival Orchestra version, differs slightly by being slightly faster in three of the movements creating marginally more flow but with less attention to the details drawn out in the later version. Essentially the two performances share the same concept and venue but not the same coupling and that will possibly be the deciding factor for many purchasers.

The later 2009 performance includes Mahler's Ruckert-Lieder sung with complete empathy by Magdalena Kozena. This will be a more natural coupling for many purchasers and makes sense both as a pairing of the composer as well as the singer in both works. Abbado delivers his typically intimate vision of both works and is followed to perfection by his orchestra.

However, this earlier 2006 disc is not to be discounted and offers a most imaginative 15 minute on-screen guide to the complex world of Pelleas in a number of ways. The disc commences with an optional introductory illustrated documentary which explains how the piece will progress. This involves a verbal soundtrack supported by the poem upon which the work is based. This is accompanied with extracts from the following performance which are also colour coded to identify the use of key themes. In addition there are illustrations from artworks of the period as part of the screen presentation.

After this the piece is performed, supported by both subheadings and coloured bands to keep the viewer fully informed as to what is going on. This is a remarkable presentational effort at combining performance with an effective guided tour which is both very helpful and not at all intrusive. The performance itself is of the highest quality.

The following Mahler symphony is very similar to the later version and indeed, many of these players also form part of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra. Nevertheless, it would be reasonable to comment that the Festival orchestra has the edge as an orchestra and that the sound on that disc has the greater sense of sheer 'presence' even if the surround option is not as clearly defined as on this earlier disc. Abbado's vision is essentially the same but is better delivered with rather more sophistication by the older players. These distinctions are relatively marginal and it is likely that those who warm to Abbado's vision of Mahler 4 would enjoy either performance.

The camera work is as excellent as one would expect from the Paul Smaczny team as is the imaging. The sound is presented in more defined DTS 5.1 than the later disc and there is also a stereo option. This is a good HD production of high quality throughout.

I would suggest therefore, that for those who are primarily interested in the Mahler, the obvious choice would be to purchase Abbado's later 2009 version coupled with the Ruckert-Lieder. However, for those also interested in the Schoenberg piece, I would suggest that it would be hard to imagine a more helpful presentation or one better performed and recorded than this 2006 disc and that for those purchasers this would make a very attractive proposition.",1385251200,4,3109,5.003868471953578

It wouldn`t take long to become addicted to the classical if anyone had the opportunity of ..........and enough time.",1382918400,,148,5.7727272727272725
8573861,5,B00BU8EPAW,"The standout here is the magnificent performance of the Schoenberg early tone poem Pelleas and Melisande.  Written before (depending on your point of view) Schoenberg lost the plot and went 12 tone, it is a wonderful post Wagnerian masterpiece somewhat similar to the equally magnificent first two parts of Gurrelieder. (Now THAT would be a gem on Blu-ray!) This young orchestra play like champions and both works are played and recorded magnificently. We already have several excellent Blu-ray recordings of the Mahler but this is as good as any and with the Schoenberg it is a disc not to be missed.",1372032000,,601,4.9504950495049505
