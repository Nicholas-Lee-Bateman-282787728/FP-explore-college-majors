8063106,3,B0009MDPSS,"I rented this for instant viewing to watch with my daughter when she was studying World History.  Although the video is very dated, the views in the Forbidden City are worth seeing, and the video puts the magnificence of the art and architecture in perspective by also talking about the suffering of peasants who were not allowed inside.  As a view of the Forbidden City, the video was worth the $2.99 and hour we spent watching it.

There is a fair amount of time spent on life in China in 1960's (which is ""modern"" as of the time this video was made) which, now, adds another layer of history education.  Because it shows what family life was like in 1963 and what kids and young students were expected to do, it provides a very interesting contrast with American life in the new millennium.  While I didn't expect (or particularly want) a video on that aspect of Chinese life, it's interesting and led to some useful discussions with my 15 year old.

So I disagree with the other reviewer who thought it totally boring.  It's not that bad.  I wouldn't buy it, but for the rental price it was an interesting way to see the Forbidden City and to get a sense of 1960's China, too.",1297382400,2,1180,4.455813953488372
