8124290,2,B000FKPE2Y,"A group of young Thai girls go to a spirit shrine by an abandoned home, one with a past. They light their sticks, make a wish, and then promise a sacrifice if they get their wish, such as shaving their head, or 100 hard boiled eggs. The ghost makes scary cameo appearances to make sure she gets her stuff. One girl doesn't anti-up and it causes issues for her.

Ho-Hum ghost story. Has some ""scary"" parts but for most of the feature I was bored.
