8127445,2,B000FVREB2,"Jimmy does too much watching and not enough instructing.  There's a segment with a blonde babe serving over and over again while Jimmy and John Lloyd watch and comment.  Weird and awkward.  The Bryan brothers show up and demonstrate the serve, incorrectly labeling one of the grips!  Seriously?  The saving grace of this DVD is Tracy Austin demonstrating the Volley.  She knows more about teaching than anyone in the film.  She needs to  make her own DVD.  Hey, I'm a teaching professional...I think I'll make one.  Really hard to find a good product out there.",1238025600,,561,4.810526315789474
