8200417,5,B000GDH9L4,"Alright Well. I bought Vol 1 and 2 without really knowing about the series. I was just on a fourm and saw that one of the guys on there said the 1st episode was really good so I thought like what the hell I will check it out. I decided to pick up both dvds and hoping they would be good, and I am glad I did! This is not for younger kids which I like, I don't wanna be watching some little kid cartoon liek Naruto or whatever it is.

Anyways If you loved vol 1 then you are going to love this vol 2 you get introduced to some new people, and things just start to get goin! By the end of vol:2 you are going to be like NOOOOOOO!!!! It gets so good so then you ogtta wait for Vol: 3, but I really tihnk its goin gto be worth the wait. I do not tell the story or anything because I don't want to ruin anything for anybody. So deff check this anime out

5/5!!!",1160524800,3,856,3.776536312849162
