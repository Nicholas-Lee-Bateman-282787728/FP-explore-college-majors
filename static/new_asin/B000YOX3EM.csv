8233611,5,B000YOX3EM,"I will begin with two WWII films. First is Saints and Solders, which takes place after the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes Forest in Belgium in heavy snow. American soldiers meet a British soldier carrying  an important document in German with skirmishes between both sides. The second WWII film is Mother of Mine, where a young boy is sent from Finland to Sweden to live with another family to escape an invasion from Russia.
Next is Viva Cuba, where a young boy and his girl friend travel to look for his father. Finally we have Expiration Date, a humorous film about an American Indian man tuning 25 who is afraid of being hit by a milk truck.",1381017600,2,650,4.46218487394958
8233612,4,B000YOX3EM,"Of Saints and Soldiers the film was never boring and the characters fleshed out in a believable manner.  As the men fought they bonded as is typical. When a German(the enemy) is captured by them they don't lose their wits but deal with it in a humane way.
Soldiers fighting a war on either side are basically following orders, they are told to hate and kill the enemy. This film did not have one dimentional characters, they seemed genuine, like regular people. The title is a good one. The soldier sure as heck didn't start the flame.
For an independent film on a low budget they did a darn good war film, this from a person that hates war films, I saw it because my family was watching it and I am glad I did.",1288396800,2,711,4.266666666666667
8233613,5,B000YOX3EM,"I just watched Expiration Date (borrowed from a friend) and found it delightful.  I'm buying this set today so I can have my own copy and watch (hopefully) other excellent, overlooked films.",1272758400,2,190,4.9375
