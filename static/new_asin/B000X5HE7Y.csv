2998504,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I don't usually watch Korean dramas, but this one has blown me away... I've watched the entire series about 3 times now..

It doesn't drag on, which I find typical of such dramas. There are funny elements in it, and very good chemistry amongst the characters. Well worth the money!! Highly recommended.

The only thing wrong with this set of DVDs is the subtitles themselves.. There are a few typos, but they shouldn't interfere with your understanding of the lines..

I don't think it's mentioned above, but this set comes with some bloopers and behind-the-scenes footage (all subtitled)..",1214092800,15,590,5.0
2998505,3,B000X5HE7Y,"I absolutely love this show!!  However, I got disappointed with the very last disc of the set.  The visual quality is AWEFUL, and yet some scenes of the last episode were poorly cut off( one of the scenes was my favorite scene...).  I did not like this particular copy of COFFEE PRINCE at all.  I still recommend to watch this show though.  It's just you will have to find a better copy of it.....",1211846400,21,397,4.3108108108108105
2998506,3,B000X5HE7Y,"A girl (Eun-hye Yun) poses as a guy in order to get a job at a local coffee shop in this 17-hour miniseries.  The manager falls in love with her but suppresses his feelings since he thinks she's a man.  The mood is almost always lighthearted since the characters have a childish nature, and much of the comedy is simplistic slapstick.  The characters are very sloppy, with rather disgusting eating and living habits.  Eun-hye Yun carries the series, but some of the men were kinda creepy and the male lead was only so-so.  There is a healthy amount of cheesiness in the form of relationship development, but considering how I'd have fun doing the same activities, there's probably little to complain about.  The script is unambitious (even a bit weak) and the final episode seemed rushed.  Still, this is a unique experience with great pacing and some unorthodox elements due to the uni-sex set-up. An overall good series.

However, the DVD transfer stunk. The first 8 or 9 episodes actually had excellent visual quality and great English subtitling. After that the subtitles were awful. In some cases it was impossible to figure out what the characters were talking about. In addition, the final episode seems like it was edited to 45 minutes instead of the full hour, leaving bad transitions between scenes and poor visual quality.

This really annoyed me. Crappy American television series get the ""full works"", but this nice little Korean series is apparently not good enough for American distributors to put in any effort whatsoever. Didn't anyone bother to view the final product before it was packaged and shipped out? A total disgrace.",1204761600,24,1643,4.923913043478261
2998507,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I've purchased a couple of Korean dramas that have been released on DVD here in the U.S. before, and while the content was always as expected, the DVD specs themselves left something to be desired. I'm glad to report that Coffee Prince has remedied my main gripe, anamorphic widescreen presentation. Yes, it can be viewed on a widescreen television without cropping out subtitles!

The audio quality is also very good for a Dolby Stereo track. On the video side I did notice some motion artifacts and maybe even a bit of mosquito noise here and there, even on a relatively small 40"" screen. While these issues might seem like nitpicks to many, for the price they charge on these dramas I expect perfection. At least strides are being made in that general direction.

The subtitles are quite good with only a few typos here and there. I haven't really run across anything that was horribly confusing, and while there are a few subs that go by a little too fast the vast majority are up for a comfortable reading time.

The drama itself is great and comes highly recommended. The price can be tough to swallow sight unseen, but make an effort to check this one out in whatever way you can.",1202083200,56,1187,4.589622641509434

2998509,5,B000X5HE7Y,I watched the first episode on AZN channel and couldn't wait till next week so I found some links online and watched the whole series all day for two days.  I guess you could tell I was addicted.  Gong Yoo is a hot Korean guy and the character he played will want you to want him even more.  It's an incredibly funny movie but with cheesy Asian antics at times.  Just watch it.,1201564800,13,377,4.123287671232877
2998510,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I just began watching Korean dramas, having started with Goong/Princess Hours. I kept reading excellent reviews on this one and gave it a try. It was incredibly moving, funny and compelling. It is not often that I think of the characters even after I turn off the show, but on this one I do. Gong Yoo was so sexy, vulnerable and endearing as Choi Han Kyul, the boss who is overwhelmed and terrified by his ""homosexuality"" and EHC was just at her best as Go Eun Chan, the girl who had to pretend to be a boy just to get by. Even if you don't speak Korean (which I don't), you will want to, if for no other reason than they make dramas like this one. Try the first 2 episodes, and I promise you will be hooked. The ending was a little weird, but I am hoping that this one gets a sequel. It really, really needs one!!",1198972800,8,814,4.1257861635220126
2998511,4,B000X5HE7Y,"I love Korean dramas, their story lines are so different from any American or Latina American concepts you may have seen before.  This drama in particular really made me laugh and cry... sometimes all at the same time.  While the 4 main characters were all connected to each other, it wasn't done in a way that would seem ridiculous.  The protagonist is so endearing, though sometimes a little bit over the top, yet she feels real because she's facing every-day troubles just like the rest of us - how to pay the bills this month?  How to take care of her younger sister?  You get the idea.  My only issue with these is the translations - you can tell that a different person translates each disc, and unforutnately, sometimes the meaning gets lost in translation, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience.",1198022400,24,818,4.645833333333333

Set i received is a bit retro, as the disks themselves are thick compared to modern dvds and binder sleeves instead of press-in plastic jewel case BUT they fit in my 2015 all-region Panasonic DVD player. Also, no playback issues. Wish Amazon would let me say which buyer (their rules).

2998541,4,B000X5HE7Y,"COFFEE PRINCE is a vastly entertaining Korean seventeen episode miniseries that uses comedy and slapstick humor to approach some far more serious undertones of cross dressing, homosexuality, and filial responsibility. The plot is nothing new in K-dramas: a girl dresses as a boy to get a job and falls for her boss, but what marks this film as different is the sense of how reality intersects with benevolence to make the audience care about the leads. Usually, any K-drama love film has some built in givens: a male villain competing for the female, a stern matriarch opposing the match, and an undertow of real world violence that threatens to intrude at any moment. Unlike Shakespeare whose own cross-dressing comedies involved unpeeling the differences between a headstrong female and her clueless lover, COFFEE PRINCE remains firmly rooted in the pleasant world of love building in which gritty realism is only permitted to appear as momentary and harmless aberrations. No one is ""evil"" in the orthodox cinematic sense, but buffoons and innocuous pseudo-villains abound whose only function is to highlight by comparison the essential goodness of the leads.

Eun-hye Yun is Go Yun Chan a slender boyish looking woman in her twenties who is cute but chooses to dress in a manner that de-emphasizes her true gender. She is the sole support of her mother and younger sister and is determined to forego love in order to ensure a high-paying job. She learns of a job as a waiter in a newly-opening coffee shop, but this job is open only to men. She applies and is accepted. Here credibility is strained since Go Yun Chan looks far more female than male, but the audience is required to maintain that willing suspension of disbelief that is needed to make the genre work. Her boss is Choi Han Kyul (Yoo Gong) a rich but bored grandson of a matriarch who demands that her grandson marry a suitable woman, with ""suitable"" defined mostly in financially and socially acceptable terms. She sends him out on arranged dates via a matchmaking service, all of which emerge as predictable catastrophes. He wants love but does not want to enter his grandmother's empire as the nepotism heir; he wants to make it ""on his own."" So she orders him to start the coffee business, hence the need for suitable help.

Choi Han Kyul finds himself strangely attracted to Eun-hye Yun, and it is right here that COFFEE PRINCE briefly and gently flirts with the sobering themes of same-sex attraction. But this is a film of romantic comedy and not one tying to make a bold statement about gay rights. At one point, before he learns of Eun-hye Yun's true gender, he tells her that he wants her whether she is ""human or alien."" There are numerous obstacles of course, one being Choi Han Kyul himself, who, when learning of Eun-hye-Yun's secret breaks up with her and fires her. Other obstacles intrude: his stern grandmother, his co-workers who waffle between accepting her as a boy but rejecting her as a girl, and Eun-hye Yun who has to choose to follow her heart or her bank account.

The twin leads are not one-dimensional stick figures. They are both sincere and essentially good-hearted. Each has a dream and COFFEE PRINCE allows both to carve out a small slice of life that might accommodate both divergent paths. This film is enjoyable not because of the sometimes trickiness of cross-dressing but rather for the best of reasons. We learn to care enough about them to wink at the real-world improbabilities that constitute the celluloid benevolent universe of Choi Han Kyul and Eun-hye Yun.",1449878400,,3569,4.857142857142857

2998544,5,B000X5HE7Y,"The First Shop Of Coffee Prince is about the life of Go Eun Chan. It is not easy; she works many jobs to pay off debts and even gave up her feminine image. Choi Han Kyul is the heir of a big food company, but his grandmother wants him to settle down, so she arranged many dates for him. After Eun Chan bumped into Han Kyul and was mistaken for a boy, Han Kyul decided to hire Eun Chan to be his gay lover in order to avoid the arranged dates. Desperately in need of money, Eun Chan had no choice but to accept. Han Kyul's grandmother also made Han Kyul in charge of a filthy coffee shop in danger of being bankrupt. Eun Chan begged to work at the coffee shop, and not long after, feelings start to spark, except, how would Han Kyul accept his ""homosexuality""?

It took me a while to get into this drama as I felt that it dragged in its early episodes. But as I went through viewing it, there is no doubt that this is a CLASSIC DRAMA. The First Shop of the Coffee Prince provides refreshing themes about homosexuality, self-sacrifice, hard work,dreams,ambition,success,emotional and psychological issues that one may face in life. The story is one-of-a-kind and not your typical Asian drama.

Yoon Eun Hye,playing the tomboyish Eun Chan, played her role extremely well. Her chemistry with Goong Yoo, who played the confused Choi Han Kyul,is commendable too. Their chemistry was excellent. Both deserved their MBC acting awards for their work in this drama. The supporting cast is commendable as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack was magnificent.

A must-see Korean drama!!!!!!",1416614400,,1579,4.652329749103942

2998554,5,B000X5HE7Y,"""The First Shop of Coffee Prince"" is the first Korean drama I ever watched, and it's still the gold standard by which I judge all Kdramas. I watched it online several times before deciding to buy a copy.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of bootlegs out there, so it's important to look for the words ""authorized US edition"" or ""licensed product"". This one is the real deal. The subtitles are good, written in standard, American colloquial English, with very few typos. The video quality is high also, at least it was on my 9-inch portable DVD player. I can't vouch for how it would on a larger screen HD or plasma tv. There are 17 episodes on 6 disks, plus one disk of extras. They came in a nice trifold box set.

As for the series itself, it's a chick flick on steroids. There are at least 4 interconnected love stories, all centered around the titular coffee shop. The main story is the romance between playboy Choi Han Kyul, the  29-year old owner of the shop, and his employee Ko Eun Chae, an androgynous young woman who poses as a man to work at the all-male cafe. Eun Chae takes the job because she needs the money, but then begins to have feelings for Han Kyul. She is afraid to reveal her gender for fear of losing both her job and Han Kyul's friendship, but Han Kyul meanwhile is disturbed by his growing attraction to this ""boy"".  While it's obvious to everyone around them what is going on, they both fight it as long as they can...

An excellent ensemble cast and a good balance of humor, drama and romance make this series well worth watching. I only wish it would come down a bit in price so that more people could enjoy it. Four and a half stars.",1375488000,4,1661,4.3624595469255665

2998558,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I got hooked on this series starting with episode 1 all the way till the end. Great acting from the entire cast, especially the lead couple (played by Yoon Eun Hye and Gong Yoo) who have great on-screen chemistry.  The show will leave you feeling warm and happy.

This is the official North America version with excellent picture and sound qualities. The English subtitles are translated well, but on some occasions they disappeared a bit too fast on screen. This is a little frustrating during some of the longer double-row translations.

This DVD set also contains a full disc of behind-the-scenes, making-of, and gag reels, which are also fun to watch.

If you like this TV serie and want to watch more like this, I highly recommend another popular Korean romantic comedy ""My Girl"" which will also make you laugh and feel warm and happy. Similarities between these two:

- both stories center around the female leads taking on false identities
- both of the male leads are heirs to a big family business headed by a grandparent
- both female leads are upbeat and optimistic, and pull off comedic scenes well",1368748800,,1110,4.760416666666667

2998564,2,B000X5HE7Y,"I watched the series when it first came out and I finally decided to purchase it. Despite all the reviews I kept thinking ""it can't be that bad"". I started re-watching the series right after I received it. The first 9 episodes had great audio quality and the English subs were good too. The video quality lacked a bit (not exactly HD) but it was still good quality. But from episode 10 to 16 the subs were poorly translated (grammar and punctuation was poor and unbearable), and at times it is hard to figure out what is being said. The only good thing was that the audio and video quality were still decent. When I finally got to episode 17 (last episode), everything changed. The audio and video quality changed completely (poor quality - like a tv recording), but the subs improved a little.

Overall, I am disappointed with the quality of this DVD - should have listened to the reviews- but I would recommend watching the series. It is another romantic comedy drama, so if you watch it be prepared to have some ""aww"" moments.

As one of the reviews said, maybe you can try the ""American"" version. Although it is slightly more expensive, the quality might be better; and you may not have as many disappointing moments as most of the people that purchased the ""bootleg""/poor quality DVD of Coffee Prince.",1359849600,6,1306,4.600858369098712

I first watched ""Creating Destiny"" and watched [ASIN:7799711817 Baby Faced Beauty (Korean Drama) English/Chinese subtitle]] and I was impressed by each one, but this tops the cake. This was soooo good that I cannot wait to see it all over again after a little break and cannot wait to introduce it to everyone I know, LOL.

I cried, laughed, giggled, screamed, I went through a whole gamut of feelings watching this show. I did not think Gong Yoo was particularly attractive the first time they showed him, but by each episode I watched, he became more and more charming, endearing, heartbreakingly sexy. :) And Lee Sun Gyun has to have the most sexiest voice ever and he was sooo sweet in the movie. Great leading men and the actresses were great.

Still the same formula...
- Leading man is rich and good looking.
- Pooping joke.

but unlike other k-dramas.
- Nobody has cancer.
- No one had nosebleeds.
- And it really looked like they were kissing as opposed to just pressing their lips together. :)",1356912000,,1032,4.628415300546448

It is also a smart and well written drama, with great filming and a great sound track.  The cast is excellent, and they work well together.  Great all round.

It is directed very well, the music does not repeat itself and is not intrusive as in other shows.  Especially pleasing are the actors - all of whom are excellent  especially the stars, Gong Yoo and Yoon Eun-Hye.  Gong Yoo made every scene believable because he seemed to express the character itself.  I did not find the last disc difficult.  Even the difficult grandmother was good and different than the typical grandmother character.  This might be because of the writing, but also because the actress who played her always does such a good job.  She has a sense of humor within her characters which makes her characters multi dimensional.  Enjoy this set!!!",1334707200,,784,4.7407407407407405

Honestly, this drama will spoil any other show you will see.  I cannot believe how fantastic the character developement and storyline was.  Not only is Yoon Eun Hye absolutely entrancing as a coltish young woman, this character is also amazing in her faults as well.

Gong Yoo plays a spoiled brat, but turns out to have such an incredibly big heart.  The lengths that he goes to to keep his love is absolutely astounding.  His character was so well played with the emotion portrayed so realistically.  The strength of the character is almost heartbreaking.

The alternate storyline starring Lee Sun Gyun as a frustrated lover and his returned girlfriend is also really interesting.

Very modern sensibility compared to others in this genre. Gong Yoo, the lead male character is not just eye candy but a very good actor. Can't wait to see what he'll appeaar in next. Don't miss this, it's really,really good!",1328313600,,347,4.612903225806452
2998587,3,B000X5HE7Y,"Let me say this first.  I absolutely love J-drama and K-drama.  My favourite series of all time is Boys over Flowers, all versions.  And this version had some fantastic things about it.  But on a personal level, I could not stand the lead actress.  I realize that the Koreans and to a lesser extent the Japanese have a thing about boyish girls.  I have lost count of how many series I have seen where the lead actress is pretending to be a boy.  Amongst that lot, I guess I like You're Beautiful the best.  But it was carried to extremes in this one.

I kept waiting for her to longingly put on a dress and feel comfortable, but alas, she wore exactly three dresses in the entire series and walked  like a male athlete in drag when she did.  Seriously, no it was worse.  The way she fell off her shoes, etc, I doubt that there is a male athlete in the world who could not have worn female clothing ten times more convincingly.  Seriosly by the mid point of the series I was just screaming ""get a sex change!"" at her.

The Koreans like their girls to act more male than males, apparently.  The males run about with nail polish and their hair lacquered, in 6 cm heels and wear boat collars and cinched waisted jackets, whilst the girls all eat like football players, stuffing  massive  spoons in  their moths until their cheeks almost explode.  The males are constantly sighing ""oh she's so strong!""

I have to wonder what is going on over in Korea.  I know it sounds like I don't like these dramas, but in fact I do.  They are deeply romantic and the men are adorable.  I just have a lot of trouble relating to other females who eat like truck drivers, and resist any and every opportunity to do even the slightest feminine thing.

This series was excellent apart from that.  But the main character took all the worst characteristics of the female heroines in K-drama and maxed them all out until I lost the ability to relate.  I kept asking myself ""why exactly are  all these men in love with her?""  In one scene, her love interest/boss serves her pizza.  She folds like 5 slices of pizza together and makes a sandwich out of it.  I guess all the guys were thinking that was cute, but I almost lost my lunch.

She did cry a lot because her boss didn't respond to her but I had a hard time believing this character actually LIKED men.",1326153600,2,2333,4.34338747099768

Chinese subtitles were clearly visible in the background and the ""Subtitles by MBC"" that appears online was conspicuously absent. After the 10th episode, the English subtitles turned to jibberish: sentence fragments, misspelled words, no capitalization or punctuation. To make things worse, the character names all reverted to Chinese spellings. I couldn't tell who was who. Someone obviously recorded this off of Hong Kong tv and did their own subtitles. Too bad they didn't speak English. Spend the money and get the ""MBC licensed"" or ""Official US"" version. This is an excellent drama, just don't buy this copy.",1318464000,3,765,4.984375
2998590,3,B000X5HE7Y,"This is a fantastic Korean drama and one of my favorites. It's not so soap-opera-ish as too many of them are. It also has a unique musical sense which sets it further apart from the pack. I just wanted to once again comment on official North American MBC DVD releases. This packaging on this box set must have been a labor of love from a fan of the show. Just opening it up and unfolding it's doors brings images of the show rushing in. Nice quality. The video, however, as is typical with MBC North American releases is lacking. While at first glance the picture looks bright and sharp, you'll soon notice over-sharpening in some areas. Even more distressing is when the video quality takes a nose dive when busy patterns or fast motion arrive. That's when you see very heavy compression (a sort of image noise). I suspect that for some reason they compressed it first, and then sharpened it which just accentuates the noise. Very distracting. And very disappointing. However it's quite watchable if you just get over it; you don't see it all of the time. And this is the best quality of the series you will be able to get outside of the official Korean release which you can't play here.",1308960000,6,1189,4.534883720930233

Just having finished the final episode of Coffee Prince, I have to rate it as one of my favorites. I consumed the entire series in four days and can't remember when I felt happier about 17 hours of viewing.

It doesn't matter if you've never watched a Korean drama before; if you enjoy a good love story with all the ups and downs, this one will keep you engrossed. Everything from the production quality, to the acting, to the soundtrack is on par with the best Hollywood has ever given us. The characters grow and develop throughout the story, there's plenty of movement in every episode, and the ending (while some reviewers felt it seemed rushed) was satisfying and worked well. Knowing there was a happily-ever-after was good enough that I didn't need to see it play out on screen.

The songs and musical tracks provided a beautiful backdrop and if you're even the least bit sentimental, you'll find yourself smiling and crying as the story moves along.

The first discs were very well translated, so much so that I stayed with the whole series in spite of the language problems.

If you're a fan, then I guess it's better than nothing, but for episodes 11 thru 16 the English subtitles make almost no sense. Even the names of the characters are all spelt differently.

Actually it gets pretty funny when one character intends to yell ""You're heart was with another woman."" but instead screams ""Your heart is in another woman."" ......""I hope you are...""  turns into something like text messaging...""I heart you are..."" and apparently they ran out of money for a real translator and hired a grade schooler, because the spelling errors make this even harder to understand.  But, again if you're a fan who wants to own a copy, there isn't any other choice at this time, just make sure you don't buy the higher priced versions thinking they'll be any better.

2998605,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I have watched several Korean TV dramas, but this one simply bowled me over. I have already watched it three times. The director seems to have perfected the art of making a popular TV drama series that appeals to audiences not just in Korea but across most Asian and Middle Eastern cultures. BTW, I don't speak Korean nor do I have Korean ancestry.

I also watched ""Kim Sam Soon"" and can't help comparing similarities between these two popular TV dramas:
1. In both, the lead female actress learns culinary skills in a European country.
2. In both, the lead male actor owns/manages a restaurant.
3. In both, the lead female actress works for the lead male actor in the restaurant.
4. In both, the lead male actor hires the lead female actress to fake a romantic relationship.
5. In both, the lead female actress lives at home with a sister and widowed mother.
6. In both, the lead male actor is the heir to a rich family business that is headed by an aging matriarch.

But that's where the similarities end. Coffee Prince brings a fresh new twist to the usual romantic-tragic story lines of Korean TV dramas.

Coffee Prince is a fast-moving, light-hearted romantic comedy that does not dwell over the usual tragic scenes that are so common in Korean TV dramas. The most tragically moving scene for me was when Choi Han Gyul cries at the Charnel House while paying homage to his long-dead biological mother.",1263772800,8,1406,4.661290322580645
2998606,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I been kinda lost in a cloud for the last 5 days. While at work, I couldn't wait to rush home and continue watching this DVD set of the South Korean mini-series COFFEE PRINCE (aka 1st SHOP OF COFFEE PRINCE).

Aside from a couple rather crude visual jokes, this is a delightful romp -- at least whenever the young-woman-mistaken-for-a-young-man is on screen. The actress's name is Yun Eun Hye (pronounced approximately: yoon oon hay). This cutie carries the show the way that Sandra Bullock carried WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. She's the reason I'm giving this product 5 stars instead of 4. You might say she stole my heart.

Eun Hye was so good that it took me a while to appreciate the contribution of the amiable lead actor Gong Yoo, and others. And to realize how individual the other characters are. Their intricate interactions give the show a unique texture.

About half way thru the series, I looked up the actors on the internet and was stunned to learn that I was already familiar with Eun Hye. She sang as part of a Korean girl group called BABY VOX which disbanded around 2005. There were prettier girls in the group, but she's the only one I can still picture in my head. Yet I didn't reconcile the two faces until that moment.

This role might have made her a big star in Korea but an earlier TV series already did that, GOONG (aka PALACE, aka PRINCESS HOURS). I guess that's gonna be my next viewing.",1259798400,8,1410,4.517647058823529

I decided to buy the coffee prince for her, and watched, and was really entertained by the story and the chemistry between the male and female lead.  I liked the music as well.  The supporting couple added some serious tension, and actually came off as a realistic couple/breakup/etc. I thought the ending was a bit rushed, but still felt glad i watched it.  Get this version if you're going to watch this, i wound up buying this one after buying a cheap one on eBay.  The subtitles on the eBay were way off, and the discs would skip/freeze.

Up until the.... 4th disc? I forget which but the last two anyway, have REALLY bad subs... it looks like they let in grade school kids to come in and sub it, even the episodes I watched online while it was coming out were better than this.

I purchased the box set 1) for a keepsake, and 2) so my brother could watch it, but the last two disc's subs were so bad I had to go online and look for them on Veoh.

I also had a problem with the discs, they would not play on my ps2 (but it is old and selectivly plays whatever it wants), along with 2 different Xbox 360s. I ended up watching it on my laptop.

Overall I would highly reccomend the show, but I wish there was another version of the dvd to buy :(",1244592000,3,1096,3.9681818181818183

On the other hand, Go Eun Chan,is a 24 year old tomboy who gets mistaken as a guy quite often. She takes up every job possible. Eun Chan accidentally meets Han Kyul twice, once on a delivery and once during a robbery. During the robbery, Eun Chan's delivery motorcycle ends up being damaged. Han Kyul, not knowing that Eun Chan is actually a girl, decides to hire Eun Chan as a false ""lover"" so that he can escape the blind dates arranged by his grandmother.  After getting an ultimatum from his grandmother, Han Kyul takes over a run-down old coffee shop, later renamed Coffee Prince, to prove his ability,to his grandmother.  In order to attract female customers, he only hires good looking male employees. In a struggle with money, Eun Chan, whom Han Kyul has already mistaken as a boy, hides her gender identity to get a job at Coffee Prince. Soon feelings start to spark between Eun Chan and Han Kyul. Because he's unaware that Eun Chan is a girl, Han Kyul starts to question his sexuality.

And so the adventure of Roamnce begins with the two. The show was well written, but it was the chemistry between the characters that sneer you in. As soon as you see the first episode your eyes will be glued to you television set, you won't want it to end.",1221177600,2,1420,4.474903474903475

2998615,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I have to write this now. I am addicted to Korean dramas (soaps). And this by far is the best one. I haven't even finished it, and I have to talk about it. It's got everything a girl could love in Chick Flick movies. Girl pretends to be guy, falls in love with a guy who thinks she is a guy... and guy falls for girl but thinks he's a guy and he thinks he might be gay because of it. I'm sure they'll end up together. All chick flicks tend to have a happy ending.

I do want to say this to any person interested in purchasing a korean soap opera/drama and has never done it before or saw one, start off with Winter Sonata, Beautiful Days or Autumn Love (???) because this one is soooooooo good, that the others won't compare.

This one is light, breezy, whimsy, romantic dramedy that moves quickly.  The other ones I mentioned are great but have a tragic overtone. This one... is more modern and geared toward a younger audience than the ones mentioned.

I love this and will update this entry once I finish the series.",1218585600,18,1019,4.237113402061856

It doesn't drag on, which I find typical of such dramas. There are funny elements in it, and very good chemistry amongst the characters. Well worth the money!! Highly recommended.

The only thing wrong with this set of DVDs is the subtitles themselves.. There are a few typos, but they shouldn't interfere with your understanding of the lines..

3233003,3,B000X5HE7Y,"A girl (Eun-hye Yun) poses as a guy in order to get a job at a local coffee shop in this 17-hour miniseries.  The manager falls in love with her but suppresses his feelings since he thinks she's a man.  The mood is almost always lighthearted since the characters have a childish nature, and much of the comedy is simplistic slapstick.  The characters are very sloppy, with rather disgusting eating and living habits.  Eun-hye Yun carries the series, but some of the men were kinda creepy and the male lead was only so-so.  There is a healthy amount of cheesiness in the form of relationship development, but considering how I'd have fun doing the same activities, there's probably little to complain about.  The script is unambitious (even a bit weak) and the final episode seemed rushed.  Still, this is a unique experience with great pacing and some unorthodox elements due to the uni-sex set-up. An overall good series.

However, the DVD transfer stunk. The first 8 or 9 episodes actually had excellent visual quality and great English subtitling. After that the subtitles were awful. In some cases it was impossible to figure out what the characters were talking about. In addition, the final episode seems like it was edited to 45 minutes instead of the full hour, leaving bad transitions between scenes and poor visual quality.

This really annoyed me. Crappy American television series get the ""full works"", but this nice little Korean series is apparently not good enough for American distributors to put in any effort whatsoever. Didn't anyone bother to view the final product before it was packaged and shipped out? A total disgrace.",1204761600,24,1643,4.923913043478261
3233004,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I've purchased a couple of Korean dramas that have been released on DVD here in the U.S. before, and while the content was always as expected, the DVD specs themselves left something to be desired. I'm glad to report that Coffee Prince has remedied my main gripe, anamorphic widescreen presentation. Yes, it can be viewed on a widescreen television without cropping out subtitles!

The audio quality is also very good for a Dolby Stereo track. On the video side I did notice some motion artifacts and maybe even a bit of mosquito noise here and there, even on a relatively small 40"" screen. While these issues might seem like nitpicks to many, for the price they charge on these dramas I expect perfection. At least strides are being made in that general direction.

The subtitles are quite good with only a few typos here and there. I haven't really run across anything that was horribly confusing, and while there are a few subs that go by a little too fast the vast majority are up for a comfortable reading time.

The drama itself is great and comes highly recommended. The price can be tough to swallow sight unseen, but make an effort to check this one out in whatever way you can.",1202083200,56,1187,4.589622641509434

It was incredibly moving, funny and compelling. It is not often that I think of the characters even after I turn off the show, but on this one I do. Gong Yoo was so sexy, vulnerable and endearing as Choi Han Kyul, the boss who is overwhelmed and terrified by his ""homosexuality"" and EHC was just at her best as Go Eun Chan, the girl who had to pretend to be a boy just to get by. Even if you don't speak Korean (which I don't), you will want to, if for no other reason than they make dramas like this one. Try the first 2 episodes, and I promise you will be hooked.

This drama in particular really made me laugh and cry... sometimes all at the same time.  While the 4 main characters were all connected to each other, it wasn't done in a way that would seem ridiculous.  The protagonist is so endearing, though sometimes a little bit over the top, yet she feels real because she's facing every-day troubles just like the rest of us - how to pay the bills this month?  How to take care of her younger sister?  You get the idea.  My only issue with these is the translations - you can tell that a different person translates each disc, and unforutnately, sometimes the meaning gets lost in translation, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience.",1198022400,24,818,4.645833333333333

3233038,4,B000X5HE7Y,"COFFEE PRINCE is a vastly entertaining Korean seventeen episode miniseries that uses comedy and slapstick humor to approach some far more serious undertones of cross dressing, homosexuality, and filial responsibility. The plot is nothing new in K-dramas: a girl dresses as a boy to get a job and falls for her boss, but what marks this film as different is the sense of how reality intersects with benevolence to make the audience care about the leads. Usually, any K-drama love film has some built in givens: a male villain competing for the female, a stern matriarch opposing the match, and an undertow of real world violence that threatens to intrude at any moment. Unlike Shakespeare whose own cross-dressing comedies involved unpeeling the differences between a headstrong female and her clueless lover, COFFEE PRINCE remains firmly rooted in the pleasant world of love building in which gritty realism is only permitted to appear as momentary and harmless aberrations. No one is ""evil"" in the orthodox cinematic sense, but buffoons and innocuous pseudo-villains abound whose only function is to highlight by comparison the essential goodness of the leads.

Eun-hye Yun is Go Yun Chan a slender boyish looking woman in her twenties who is cute but chooses to dress in a manner that de-emphasizes her true gender. She is the sole support of her mother and younger sister and is determined to forego love in order to ensure a high-paying job. She learns of a job as a waiter in a newly-opening coffee shop, but this job is open only to men. She applies and is accepted. Here credibility is strained since Go Yun Chan looks far more female than male, but the audience is required to maintain that willing suspension of disbelief that is needed to make the genre work. Her boss is Choi Han Kyul (Yoo Gong) a rich but bored grandson of a matriarch who demands that her grandson marry a suitable woman, with ""suitable"" defined mostly in financially and socially acceptable terms. She sends him out on arranged dates via a matchmaking service, all of which emerge as predictable catastrophes. He wants love but does not want to enter his grandmother's empire as the nepotism heir; he wants to make it ""on his own."" So she orders him to start the coffee business, hence the need for suitable help.

Choi Han Kyul finds himself strangely attracted to Eun-hye Yun, and it is right here that COFFEE PRINCE briefly and gently flirts with the sobering themes of same-sex attraction. But this is a film of romantic comedy and not one tying to make a bold statement about gay rights. At one point, before he learns of Eun-hye Yun's true gender, he tells her that he wants her whether she is ""human or alien."" There are numerous obstacles of course, one being Choi Han Kyul himself, who, when learning of Eun-hye-Yun's secret breaks up with her and fires her. Other obstacles intrude: his stern grandmother, his co-workers who waffle between accepting her as a boy but rejecting her as a girl, and Eun-hye Yun who has to choose to follow her heart or her bank account.

The twin leads are not one-dimensional stick figures. They are both sincere and essentially good-hearted. Each has a dream and COFFEE PRINCE allows both to carve out a small slice of life that might accommodate both divergent paths. This film is enjoyable not because of the sometimes trickiness of cross-dressing but rather for the best of reasons. We learn to care enough about them to wink at the real-world improbabilities that constitute the celluloid benevolent universe of Choi Han Kyul and Eun-hye Yun.",1449878400,,3569,4.857142857142857

3233041,5,B000X5HE7Y,"The First Shop Of Coffee Prince is about the life of Go Eun Chan. It is not easy; she works many jobs to pay off debts and even gave up her feminine image. Choi Han Kyul is the heir of a big food company, but his grandmother wants him to settle down, so she arranged many dates for him. After Eun Chan bumped into Han Kyul and was mistaken for a boy, Han Kyul decided to hire Eun Chan to be his gay lover in order to avoid the arranged dates. Desperately in need of money, Eun Chan had no choice but to accept. Han Kyul's grandmother also made Han Kyul in charge of a filthy coffee shop in danger of being bankrupt. Eun Chan begged to work at the coffee shop, and not long after, feelings start to spark, except, how would Han Kyul accept his ""homosexuality""?

It took me a while to get into this drama as I felt that it dragged in its early episodes. But as I went through viewing it, there is no doubt that this is a CLASSIC DRAMA. The First Shop of the Coffee Prince provides refreshing themes about homosexuality, self-sacrifice, hard work,dreams,ambition,success,emotional and psychological issues that one may face in life. The story is one-of-a-kind and not your typical Asian drama.

Yoon Eun Hye,playing the tomboyish Eun Chan, played her role extremely well. Her chemistry with Goong Yoo, who played the confused Choi Han Kyul,is commendable too. Their chemistry was excellent. Both deserved their MBC acting awards for their work in this drama. The supporting cast is commendable as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack was magnificent.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of bootlegs out there, so it's important to look for the words ""authorized US edition"" or ""licensed product"". This one is the real deal. The subtitles are good, written in standard, American colloquial English, with very few typos. The video quality is high also, at least it was on my 9-inch portable DVD player. I can't vouch for how it would on a larger screen HD or plasma tv. There are 17 episodes on 6 disks, plus one disk of extras. They came in a nice trifold box set.

As for the series itself, it's a chick flick on steroids. There are at least 4 interconnected love stories, all centered around the titular coffee shop. The main story is the romance between playboy Choi Han Kyul, the  29-year old owner of the shop, and his employee Ko Eun Chae, an androgynous young woman who poses as a man to work at the all-male cafe. Eun Chae takes the job because she needs the money, but then begins to have feelings for Han Kyul. She is afraid to reveal her gender for fear of losing both her job and Han Kyul's friendship, but Han Kyul meanwhile is disturbed by his growing attraction to this ""boy"".  While it's obvious to everyone around them what is going on, they both fight it as long as they can...

An excellent ensemble cast and a good balance of humor, drama and romance make this series well worth watching. I only wish it would come down a bit in price so that more people could enjoy it. Four and a half stars.",1375488000,4,1661,4.3624595469255665

3233055,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I got hooked on this series starting with episode 1 all the way till the end. Great acting from the entire cast, especially the lead couple (played by Yoon Eun Hye and Gong Yoo) who have great on-screen chemistry.  The show will leave you feeling warm and happy.

This is the official North America version with excellent picture and sound qualities. The English subtitles are translated well, but on some occasions they disappeared a bit too fast on screen. This is a little frustrating during some of the longer double-row translations.

This DVD set also contains a full disc of behind-the-scenes, making-of, and gag reels, which are also fun to watch.

If you like this TV serie and want to watch more like this, I highly recommend another popular Korean romantic comedy ""My Girl"" which will also make you laugh and feel warm and happy. Similarities between these two:

- both stories center around the female leads taking on false identities
- both of the male leads are heirs to a big family business headed by a grandparent
- both female leads are upbeat and optimistic, and pull off comedic scenes well",1368748800,,1110,4.760416666666667

3233061,2,B000X5HE7Y,"I watched the series when it first came out and I finally decided to purchase it. Despite all the reviews I kept thinking ""it can't be that bad"". I started re-watching the series right after I received it. The first 9 episodes had great audio quality and the English subs were good too. The video quality lacked a bit (not exactly HD) but it was still good quality. But from episode 10 to 16 the subs were poorly translated (grammar and punctuation was poor and unbearable), and at times it is hard to figure out what is being said. The only good thing was that the audio and video quality were still decent. When I finally got to episode 17 (last episode), everything changed. The audio and video quality changed completely (poor quality - like a tv recording), but the subs improved a little.

Overall, I am disappointed with the quality of this DVD - should have listened to the reviews- but I would recommend watching the series. It is another romantic comedy drama, so if you watch it be prepared to have some ""aww"" moments.

As one of the reviews said, maybe you can try the ""American"" version. Although it is slightly more expensive, the quality might be better; and you may not have as many disappointing moments as most of the people that purchased the ""bootleg""/poor quality DVD of Coffee Prince.",1359849600,6,1306,4.600858369098712

I first watched ""Creating Destiny"" and watched [ASIN:7799711817 Baby Faced Beauty (Korean Drama) English/Chinese subtitle]] and I was impressed by each one, but this tops the cake. This was soooo good that I cannot wait to see it all over again after a little break and cannot wait to introduce it to everyone I know, LOL.

I cried, laughed, giggled, screamed, I went through a whole gamut of feelings watching this show. I did not think Gong Yoo was particularly attractive the first time they showed him, but by each episode I watched, he became more and more charming, endearing, heartbreakingly sexy. :) And Lee Sun Gyun has to have the most sexiest voice ever and he was sooo sweet in the movie. Great leading men and the actresses were great.

Still the same formula...
- Leading man is rich and good looking.
- Pooping joke.

but unlike other k-dramas.
- Nobody has cancer.
- No one had nosebleeds.
- And it really looked like they were kissing as opposed to just pressing their lips together. :)",1356912000,,1032,4.628415300546448

It is also a smart and well written drama, with great filming and a great sound track.  The cast is excellent, and they work well together.  Great all round.

It is directed very well, the music does not repeat itself and is not intrusive as in other shows.  Especially pleasing are the actors - all of whom are excellent  especially the stars, Gong Yoo and Yoon Eun-Hye.  Gong Yoo made every scene believable because he seemed to express the character itself.  I did not find the last disc difficult.  Even the difficult grandmother was good and different than the typical grandmother character.  This might be because of the writing, but also because the actress who played her always does such a good job.  She has a sense of humor within her characters which makes her characters multi dimensional.  Enjoy this set!!!",1334707200,,784,4.7407407407407405

Honestly, this drama will spoil any other show you will see.  I cannot believe how fantastic the character developement and storyline was.  Not only is Yoon Eun Hye absolutely entrancing as a coltish young woman, this character is also amazing in her faults as well.

Gong Yoo plays a spoiled brat, but turns out to have such an incredibly big heart.  The lengths that he goes to to keep his love is absolutely astounding.  His character was so well played with the emotion portrayed so realistically.  The strength of the character is almost heartbreaking.

The alternate storyline starring Lee Sun Gyun as a frustrated lover and his returned girlfriend is also really interesting.

The supporting cast is both hilarious and also lovable. The soundtrack is also really amazing. I ended up downloading a couple of the songs myself.",1332806400,,937,4.904458598726115

Very modern sensibility compared to others in this genre. Gong Yoo, the lead male character is not just eye candy but a very good actor. Can't wait to see what he'll appeaar in next. Don't miss this, it's really,really good!",1328313600,,347,4.612903225806452
3233084,3,B000X5HE7Y,"Let me say this first.  I absolutely love J-drama and K-drama.  My favourite series of all time is Boys over Flowers, all versions.  And this version had some fantastic things about it.  But on a personal level, I could not stand the lead actress.  I realize that the Koreans and to a lesser extent the Japanese have a thing about boyish girls.  I have lost count of how many series I have seen where the lead actress is pretending to be a boy.  Amongst that lot, I guess I like You're Beautiful the best.  But it was carried to extremes in this one.

I kept waiting for her to longingly put on a dress and feel comfortable, but alas, she wore exactly three dresses in the entire series and walked  like a male athlete in drag when she did.  Seriously, no it was worse.  The way she fell off her shoes, etc, I doubt that there is a male athlete in the world who could not have worn female clothing ten times more convincingly.  Seriosly by the mid point of the series I was just screaming ""get a sex change!"" at her.

The Koreans like their girls to act more male than males, apparently.  The males run about with nail polish and their hair lacquered, in 6 cm heels and wear boat collars and cinched waisted jackets, whilst the girls all eat like football players, stuffing  massive  spoons in  their moths until their cheeks almost explode.  The males are constantly sighing ""oh she's so strong!""

I have to wonder what is going on over in Korea.  I know it sounds like I don't like these dramas, but in fact I do.  They are deeply romantic and the men are adorable.  I just have a lot of trouble relating to other females who eat like truck drivers, and resist any and every opportunity to do even the slightest feminine thing.

This series was excellent apart from that.  But the main character took all the worst characteristics of the female heroines in K-drama and maxed them all out until I lost the ability to relate.  I kept asking myself ""why exactly are  all these men in love with her?""  In one scene, her love interest/boss serves her pizza.  She folds like 5 slices of pizza together and makes a sandwich out of it.  I guess all the guys were thinking that was cute, but I almost lost my lunch.

She did cry a lot because her boss didn't respond to her but I had a hard time believing this character actually LIKED men.",1326153600,2,2333,4.34338747099768

Chinese subtitles were clearly visible in the background and the ""Subtitles by MBC"" that appears online was conspicuously absent. After the 10th episode, the English subtitles turned to jibberish: sentence fragments, misspelled words, no capitalization or punctuation. To make things worse, the character names all reverted to Chinese spellings. I couldn't tell who was who. Someone obviously recorded this off of Hong Kong tv and did their own subtitles. Too bad they didn't speak English. Spend the money and get the ""MBC licensed"" or ""Official US"" version. This is an excellent drama, just don't buy this copy.",1318464000,3,765,4.984375
3233087,3,B000X5HE7Y,"This is a fantastic Korean drama and one of my favorites. It's not so soap-opera-ish as too many of them are. It also has a unique musical sense which sets it further apart from the pack. I just wanted to once again comment on official North American MBC DVD releases. This packaging on this box set must have been a labor of love from a fan of the show. Just opening it up and unfolding it's doors brings images of the show rushing in. Nice quality. The video, however, as is typical with MBC North American releases is lacking. While at first glance the picture looks bright and sharp, you'll soon notice over-sharpening in some areas. Even more distressing is when the video quality takes a nose dive when busy patterns or fast motion arrive. That's when you see very heavy compression (a sort of image noise). I suspect that for some reason they compressed it first, and then sharpened it which just accentuates the noise. Very distracting. And very disappointing. However it's quite watchable if you just get over it; you don't see it all of the time. And this is the best quality of the series you will be able to get outside of the official Korean release which you can't play here.",1308960000,6,1189,4.534883720930233

Just having finished the final episode of Coffee Prince, I have to rate it as one of my favorites. I consumed the entire series in four days and can't remember when I felt happier about 17 hours of viewing.

It doesn't matter if you've never watched a Korean drama before; if you enjoy a good love story with all the ups and downs, this one will keep you engrossed. Everything from the production quality, to the acting, to the soundtrack is on par with the best Hollywood has ever given us. The characters grow and develop throughout the story, there's plenty of movement in every episode, and the ending (while some reviewers felt it seemed rushed) was satisfying and worked well. Knowing there was a happily-ever-after was good enough that I didn't need to see it play out on screen.

The songs and musical tracks provided a beautiful backdrop and if you're even the least bit sentimental, you'll find yourself smiling and crying as the story moves along.

If you're a fan, then I guess it's better than nothing, but for episodes 11 thru 16 the English subtitles make almost no sense. Even the names of the characters are all spelt differently.

Actually it gets pretty funny when one character intends to yell ""You're heart was with another woman."" but instead screams ""Your heart is in another woman."" ......""I hope you are...""  turns into something like text messaging...""I heart you are..."" and apparently they ran out of money for a real translator and hired a grade schooler, because the spelling errors make this even harder to understand.  But, again if you're a fan who wants to own a copy, there isn't any other choice at this time, just make sure you don't buy the higher priced versions thinking they'll be any better.

3233101,1,B000X5HE7Y,"I love this korean drama. But unfortunately the one I bought is pirated. The video gets blurry and the last 2 CDs have english subtitles that were all mixed up, not understandable at all. Be careful. Don't just buy it. Check if it is the original. Buy original!!!!",1265760000,5,264,4.520833333333333
3233102,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I have watched several Korean TV dramas, but this one simply bowled me over. I have already watched it three times. The director seems to have perfected the art of making a popular TV drama series that appeals to audiences not just in Korea but across most Asian and Middle Eastern cultures. BTW, I don't speak Korean nor do I have Korean ancestry.

I also watched ""Kim Sam Soon"" and can't help comparing similarities between these two popular TV dramas:
1. In both, the lead female actress learns culinary skills in a European country.
2. In both, the lead male actor owns/manages a restaurant.
3. In both, the lead female actress works for the lead male actor in the restaurant.
4. In both, the lead male actor hires the lead female actress to fake a romantic relationship.
5. In both, the lead female actress lives at home with a sister and widowed mother.
6. In both, the lead male actor is the heir to a rich family business that is headed by an aging matriarch.

But that's where the similarities end. Coffee Prince brings a fresh new twist to the usual romantic-tragic story lines of Korean TV dramas.

Coffee Prince is a fast-moving, light-hearted romantic comedy that does not dwell over the usual tragic scenes that are so common in Korean TV dramas. The most tragically moving scene for me was when Choi Han Gyul cries at the Charnel House while paying homage to his long-dead biological mother.",1263772800,8,1406,4.661290322580645
3233103,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I been kinda lost in a cloud for the last 5 days. While at work, I couldn't wait to rush home and continue watching this DVD set of the South Korean mini-series COFFEE PRINCE (aka 1st SHOP OF COFFEE PRINCE).

Aside from a couple rather crude visual jokes, this is a delightful romp -- at least whenever the young-woman-mistaken-for-a-young-man is on screen. The actress's name is Yun Eun Hye (pronounced approximately: yoon oon hay). This cutie carries the show the way that Sandra Bullock carried WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. She's the reason I'm giving this product 5 stars instead of 4. You might say she stole my heart.

Eun Hye was so good that it took me a while to appreciate the contribution of the amiable lead actor Gong Yoo, and others. And to realize how individual the other characters are. Their intricate interactions give the show a unique texture.

About half way thru the series, I looked up the actors on the internet and was stunned to learn that I was already familiar with Eun Hye. She sang as part of a Korean girl group called BABY VOX which disbanded around 2005. There were prettier girls in the group, but she's the only one I can still picture in my head. Yet I didn't reconcile the two faces until that moment.

This role might have made her a big star in Korea but an earlier TV series already did that, GOONG (aka PALACE, aka PRINCESS HOURS). I guess that's gonna be my next viewing.",1259798400,8,1410,4.517647058823529
3233104,5,B000X5HE7Y,"Yoon Eun Hye is my wife's favorite K-drama actress, I'd be in a different room when I heard her cracking up while watching the Princess Hours / Palace / Goong, whatever name it ultimately goes by.  I decided to buy the coffee prince for her, and watched, and was really entertained by the story and the chemistry between the male and female lead.  I liked the music as well.  The supporting couple added some serious tension, and actually came off as a realistic couple/breakup/etc. I thought the ending was a bit rushed, but still felt glad i watched it.  Get this version if you're going to watch this, i wound up buying this one after buying a cheap one on eBay.  The subtitles on the eBay were way off, and the discs would skip/freeze.  This product is great, and the subtitles are dead on.  Enjoy this one, I'm looking forward to Yoon Eun Hye's new drama debuting soon in Korea.",1250208000,14,883,4.48125
3233105,5,B000X5HE7Y,"Coffee Prince was the very first k drama that I ever saw and I can't think of a better way to be introduced to this genre of T.V. shows. This drama is funny, romantic and OH so cute. The story and the relationships involved are fully explored. I have watched a couple of K dramas besides this one and this is the best I've come across. I highly recommend this to anyone. I'm sure you'll be just as addicted as I am!! :]",1247529600,5,419,4.0602409638554215

3233107,3,B000X5HE7Y,"I love this show, if you like Kdrama, I would say this is a must see! The first episode is kind of jumbled together to set the stage for the rest of the story, but the rest of the show is great about following one story line. If you like huge plot twists and the introduction of mystery characters you won't like this series, it is very natural in my opinion, though I would never say slow.

Up until the.... 4th disc? I forget which but the last two anyway, have REALLY bad subs... it looks like they let in grade school kids to come in and sub it, even the episodes I watched online while it was coming out were better than this.

I purchased the box set 1) for a keepsake, and 2) so my brother could watch it, but the last two disc's subs were so bad I had to go online and look for them on Veoh.

I also had a problem with the discs, they would not play on my ps2 (but it is old and selectivly plays whatever it wants), along with 2 different Xbox 360s. I ended up watching it on my laptop.

Overall I would highly reccomend the show, but I wish there was another version of the dvd to buy :(",1244592000,3,1096,3.9681818181818183

The boxed set is superb quality.  Video, audio, and captioning is top notch.  Beats huddling around your computer screen watching a mediocre copy.  You deserve the DVD quality; BUY IT!",1233187200,5,410,4.472972972972973
3233110,5,B000X5HE7Y,"Choi Han Kyul is the cocky son of a rich family who runs a food corporation. He doesn't believe in love and doesn't want to get married despite his family's requests. On the other hand, Go Eun Chan,is a 24 year old tomboy who gets mistaken as a guy quite often. She takes up every job possible. Eun Chan accidentally meets Han Kyul twice, once on a delivery and once during a robbery. During the robbery, Eun Chan's delivery motorcycle ends up being damaged. Han Kyul, not knowing that Eun Chan is actually a girl, decides to hire Eun Chan as a false ""lover"" so that he can escape the blind dates arranged by his grandmother.  After getting an ultimatum from his grandmother, Han Kyul takes over a run-down old coffee shop, later renamed Coffee Prince, to prove his ability,to his grandmother.  In order to attract female customers, he only hires good looking male employees. In a struggle with money, Eun Chan, whom Han Kyul has already mistaken as a boy, hides her gender identity to get a job at Coffee Prince. Soon feelings start to spark between Eun Chan and Han Kyul. Because he's unaware that Eun Chan is a girl, Han Kyul starts to question his sexuality.

And so the adventure of Roamnce begins with the two. The show was well written, but it was the chemistry between the characters that sneer you in. As soon as you see the first episode your eyes will be glued to you television set, you won't want it to end.",1221177600,2,1420,4.474903474903475

You will laugh, you will cry, you will root for the bad boy and the androgynous/mixed-sex girl! I loved it to pieces. It was so engrossing and it made us stay up 24 hours in a last minute sleep-over party! It was just that good, that intense, that fun! There are so many dfelightful characters in this series, each one of them captures your heart.",1219276800,4,498,4.144329896907217
3233112,5,B000X5HE7Y,"I have to write this now. I am addicted to Korean dramas (soaps). And this by far is the best one. I haven't even finished it, and I have to talk about it. It's got everything a girl could love in Chick Flick movies. Girl pretends to be guy, falls in love with a guy who thinks she is a guy... and guy falls for girl but thinks he's a guy and he thinks he might be gay because of it. I'm sure they'll end up together. All chick flicks tend to have a happy ending.

I do want to say this to any person interested in purchasing a korean soap opera/drama and has never done it before or saw one, start off with Winter Sonata, Beautiful Days or Autumn Love (???) because this one is soooooooo good, that the others won't compare.

This one is light, breezy, whimsy, romantic dramedy that moves quickly.  The other ones I mentioned are great but have a tragic overtone. This one... is more modern and geared toward a younger audience than the ones mentioned.

I love this and will update this entry once I finish the series.",1218585600,18,1019,4.237113402061856
