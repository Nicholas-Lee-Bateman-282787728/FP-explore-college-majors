8332990,5,B001PCNZEA,"Let me start off by saying the other reviewer on here(krf) is an idiot and probably doesnt really know much about metal. This DVD isn't ""goth rock""(what a tool).S/he is probably lying when it says it owns the other 5 dvds in the series too because this dvd follows pretty much the same format. Ironically the video it says it liked(Dimmu Borgir) is more goth than most of the videos(technically its black metal). Every subgenre of metal is represented on this dvd including gothic metal(Epica) but no subgenre is overrepresented. If you are a real metal fan you probably already know who Exodus, Obituary, Kreator, Nile, Gojira, Job For A Cowboy, Iced Earth, Kataklysm, Meshuggah, Arsis, Hate Eternal, Behemoth etc are and you know they aren't ""goth rock"" nor do they sound like Evanescence(that clown probably thinks that style started with them since s/he only watches mtv or listens to the radio). If you don't know who most of these bands are thats ok too because you will learn from watching the videos. The Monsters of Metal dvd series is an excellent way to find bands and sample the full fange of the metal universe.",1253318400,3,1124,4.769230769230769
