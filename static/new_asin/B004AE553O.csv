8544971,5,B004AE553O,"So I'm a fan. I won't probably admit it if you asked me to my face but I like Pilates. And this version is very good. The only odd thing is the fact that the audio for the moves is recorded separately and not live. In order words, the guy is talking you through the moves like a narrator. No Tony Horton wanna be here.

The moves are very good, extremely challenging the first several times. And the biggest benefit for me is it doesn't get old and annoying quickly. I've been using the three of them for three months and am still pleased.

The video is a set of three. The mat and band work out are very good also.",1456444800,,615,4.074380165289257
8544972,5,B004AE553O,"Challenging - but very good.  I think it's the hardest of the 3 DVDs, but it comes with modifications - so you can always challenge yourself....",1438819200,,144,4.538461538461538
8544973,5,B004AE553O,"This is an intense and challenging core/abs workout with moves that I had difficulty doing so I had to modify those exercises.  This workout is one to build up, over time, with discipline.  This requires the use of the Pilates ball which is a light-weight, medium sized, air ball.

Here is the breakdown. (32:03)

8544974,4,B004AE553O,"My second rating of the ""pilates for men"" series. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but just like the #1 dvd, a warm up is missing. I'd also like to see more instructions for breathing. Sometimes it looks like the guys are holding their breath! Since men are probably not familiar with all the ""toys"" out there for exercise, some instructions on what type of ball to purchase would be helpful. Some might think its a weighted ball. It's a pilates ball filled with air. All the exercises can also be done without the ball for beginners. Great work out! My husband says it's ""kicking his butt"".  Just got the band workout. Another review coming soon.",1314230400,3,646,4.47457627118644
