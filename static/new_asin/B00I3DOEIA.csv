6248142,5,B00I3DOEIA,"For anyone who wants to see what the Burning Man experience is like, I highly recommend this documentary. The film follows several people throughout the week, as well as highlighting various art pieces, the people of black rock city, the temple and the burn.

You truly get what the week was like for these five filmmakers, immersed into what they were feeling, thinking, and doing. One of favorite moments is when they show the city from a plane. What a beautiful city!",1393545600,,470,4.7317073170731705
6248143,5,B00I3DOEIA,"As The Dust Settles is evocative, stunningly captured and innovative in it's conception!

Creatively crafted and offering a hugely colourful, yet other-worldy, aesthetic, I felt as if ATDS transported me to the playa in a slightly surreal swirl of dust and smoke, as I traversed Black Rock City with the five collaborating directors in what was to be a thoroughly enjoyable, accessible and intimate journey of self-discovery and reflection.

Highly recommmended!",1391299200,2,462,5.492957746478873
6248144,5,B00I3DOEIA,"I've always wanted to go to Burning Man but the timing has never worked out. Well, after watching AS THE DUST SETTLES I felt like i was there! So many docs today feel like there's an agenda, but not this one. It was purely experiential. I really enjoyed seeing what each person was going through, and how their personal experiences were so very different from one another. its obvious how much heart and passion went into this project, and I'm grateful I got to see and experience it.",1400457600,,484,4.511363636363637
6248145,3,B00I3DOEIA,"Not a great move so if you are looking for a movie about Burningman there are other way better movies.
It starts out slow with different younger people taking about their Burningman experience.  It didn't give a lot
of info about Burningman but mainly about the experience of these people.  The best part of the DVD was the making
of section outside the movie itself.  Maybe they should redo it and make a new movie about the making of the DVD?",1399852800,,444,4.45679012345679
6248146,5,B00I3DOEIA,"What a unique participatory documentary about a subject very few people have the chance to experience. I've heard so many myths about Burning Man fueled with opinion. It's like we know more about the bottom of the ocean than we do about this participatory festival as a society. This is a great ethnography in a sense, part immersion into the sensory and emotional environment part story, all enjoyable!",1399334400,2,403,4.9411764705882355
6248147,5,B00I3DOEIA,"When I got the DVD,  I couldn't wait to watch it so I just put it on.  Thanks to Mike and Roger, Katheryn, Jamie, Jeremy, Tarynn and everyone for taking me on a great ride to burning man.  The contemplation, connections, missed and made, the sacredness of the desert and the human heart, baring of the soul make such profound pathways in the film.  However all of you met and came together to make this and then share this, is a testament to film collaboration.  I definitely will share this and hope you all are still carrying some of the great energy you got from this.  I certainly got high just watching it.",1398729600,,611,4.3628318584070795
6248148,5,B00I3DOEIA,"We were pleasantly surprised by this documentary - there are so many that try and capture what is hard to imagine, unless you have been there - yet this one works really well.  It brings you a very personal experience (from 5 people actually) that doesn't get lost in the crazy visual party explosion that's often focused on, yet usually misrepresented.  It was very touching, I wanted to interact with these characters, I was completely drawn in.
Yes, it is challenging on the playa, but as we see through their eyes, the rewards are often great if you can only let go!
Nicely shot and produced video.  Kudos!!!!",1396396800,,613,4.657407407407407
6248149,5,B00I3DOEIA,"This will be my 5th year at Burning Man and every year has been different.  What I loved about this film is that it was from 5 different perspectives while attending the same year of Burning Man.  It gave the very real scenario where some people love it and are transformed in a positive way and some people just aren't very affected by it.  It also didn't just focus on the ""fun"" aspects of BM, but showed the pain of the dust storms and the challenges of being in the desert.  I really enjoyed watching it...it took me HOME!!",1395014400,3,527,4.292929292929293
6248150,5,B00I3DOEIA,"I honestly never heard of Burning Man before watching ATDS. I loved following the 5 artists through their experiences at Burning Man.  You feel like you are right there with them. The cinematography is captivating, beautiful and raw.
The visuals are dizzying at times, yet you don't want to look away; you want to know and feel more.  I wasn't expecting to be drawn into such an emotional experience. Bravo! Will Share!",1393718400,2,419,4.805555555555555
6248151,5,B00I3DOEIA,"After finishing the movie ""As the Dust Settles"", I had to shake out my clothes and bang out the couch cushions from all the Playa dust.  It was that real and tangible and cinematically evocative.  Thank you for transporting me to a place that I have never participated in and yet now feel that I was there.  Each artists' account is unique and vulnerable.  I also love how the film is edited with only music and sound from the actual footage.  A great work!

Love,
Jamie",1393632000,2,470,4.406976744186046
6248152,5,B00I3DOEIA,"As The Dust Settles is evocative, stunningly captured and innovative in it's conception; a very interesting peek at the interplay between environmental and emotional extremes in the bizarrely beautiful Burning Man universe!

Creatively crafted and offering a hugely colourful, yet other-worldly, aesthetic, I felt as if As The Dust Settles transported me to the playa, spell-bound in a slightly surreal swirl of dust and smoke, as I traversed Black Rock City along with the five collaborating directors in what was to be a thoroughly enjoyable, accessible and intimate journey of self-discovery, growth, and reflection.

I highly recommend this unique Burning Man documentary! Make sure to check out the special features, and enjoy the adventure!",1393632000,,746,5.535087719298246
6248153,5,B00I3DOEIA,"As one of the collaborating directors, I am proud of this film and want to offer some useful and hopefully encouraging context for those looking to watch a film about BM. I'll try to make it a fair review, while naturally inviting you to enjoy the experience!

With RED footage intermixed with handheld footage recorded by the subjects, this film combines an overview of the Burning Man experience with an insider's sense of how magical things can be. If you are looking for a documentary to dive you into appreciation for the power of the BM experience, this film definitely carries the deeper message and power of the event along with the more logistical experiences. Definitely one of the more moving films made at BM, having reviewed many of the older docs on BM. Professionally produced, with a great ""making of"" featurette in the special features... There's much more to be said, and I'll leave that to others. The film definitely leaves those who have watched it thrilled to get your ticket, and to make the most of the life-changing experience there.",1393545600,,1058,4.813186813186813
8638611,1,B00I3DOEIA,"Made me embarrassed to call myself a burner. The people profiled in this documentary seemed mostly lacking in self-awareness. The ""soul"" of the event is missing from this. I'm going back again this year for my twelfth burn, but this film did not give me any real sense of the Burning Man I know.",1469404800,,295,4.481481481481482

8638614,5,B00I3DOEIA,"I have not personally ever attended any Burning Man events but I felt immersed in the world, wonder and culture of the experience through the eyes of the participants of this documentary. There are some incredibly poignant moments and epiphanies that the ""characters"" come to in this unique coming of age story. Definitely worth a watch, a magical journey!",1436313600,,356,5.0508474576271185
8638615,1,B00I3DOEIA,"Don't waste your time or money,doesn't really give you any insight into what burning man is like,I've seen better stuff on you tube",1429401600,,131,4.739130434782608

8638618,5,B00I3DOEIA,"For years I have seen photos from Burning Man and thought to myself, ""What an amazing place/event. I'd love to go there and experience it for myself one day.""

At this point in time I have yet to attend Burning Man, so ""As The Dust Settles"" was a great way for me to experience the event without actually having to go there myself.

While this film is marketed as a ""participatory documentary"" it doesn't feel like one (and that's a good thing!), nor do I think it needs to place such a large emphasis on that aspect of the film. The editing is done in such a way that it feels like one cohesive film - shot and edited, almost entirely, by one passionate individual. If the filmmakers didn't actually tell you that this was a film shot by numerous people, you would have no idea... and that's just the way it should be in my opinion! But it is interesting that the film is participatory - only because this serves to further capture the ""spirit"" of what Burning Man is (or seems to be) all about.

Now that I have watched the film, I have mixed emotions about ever attending Burning Man for myself. While I thoroughly enjoyed the film and all the hard work that has been put into this piece of art, the experiences highlighted in the film also made me realize that as much as I can appreciate the collaborative and ""spiritual"" ideas behind Burning Man, I don't think I would be capable of participating in the event in the same way that the people in the film do.

Overall, a very well constructed documentary that pulls together what surely must have been hundreds of hours worth of footage and tells a unique story in an evocative manner. If you have any interest in Burning Man, I would definitely watch this film and and share it with your friends.",1407024000,3,1752,4.414860681114551
8638619,5,B00I3DOEIA,"Enjoyed this very much, gave me a lift on a depressing day.  The key feature about this film is that it is 'participatory' and not the usual mundane documentary format of a few people offering their 'expertise' or 'philosophical requirements.'  Having attended for the past 8 years, I could relate to most every aspect.  I think it is a great film for those who have attended and allows for some reminiscing and thoughtful reflection.  Given the fleeting shots of some aspects, people who have not attended, may just not comprehend the joy of attending and participating in the community that is Burning Man.",1403049600,,608,4.87378640776699
8638620,5,B00I3DOEIA,"This film does an amazing job of capturing the human side of Burning Man - the raw emotions and experiences that individuals face on the playa. It had me relating to the directors, and some of the footage even got me misty-eyed thinking about my own experiences. I'm grateful for everyone who worked on such an amazing project... it really took me home.

Another reviewer on here claimed that the film doesn't give a lot of info about Burning Man. That's right, and if that is what you are looking for you should check out the FAQ on the Burning Man website. But if you want to see a glimpse into the challenges and rewards that people face during their week, this is definitely the movie to watch.",1401148800,,698,4.453125
