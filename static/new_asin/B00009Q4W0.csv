7992487,4,B00009Q4W0,"CJ Mac did a good job on this documentary, especially talking about the subject of C-walking as a culture. He gave an interesting view of the effects C-walking has on gang culture, clown walking ( spinoff and international sensation ), and society. It's not exciting or action packed, but entertaining and informative. He also covered some of the basic struggles and lifestyles of gangs in the hood while keeping the focus on C-walking. The only thing missing was adding a musical soundtrack along with the documentary. Most of the beats and songs are truly good. For the price of going to a regular matinee movie, I feel this documentary was well worth the price....",1379721600,,667,4.859649122807017
7992488,5,B00009Q4W0,"This is a must for anybody to check it out. It is cool do like some dance, but to C walk when you are not a crip, nahh. CJ  brings reality to this DVD.

7992490,5,B00009Q4W0,I got a quick look at this when my coi and crew were watching it. It is a helpful guide for my kids. Growin up here you do tha c-walk you claim crip. At my son's school (He's 8) they already doin the c-walk. He come home one day asking to learn it. My coi had cought it a whole ago and my kids learned it and my crew perfected they own c-walks. It's a good cuy... I recommend u cuy it if you interested in learning it. Just c careful where u do it. You don wan get shot cuz u doing a dance which is now a fad.,1122854400,2,509,3.6363636363636362

7992492,4,B00009Q4W0,"I really think this DVD will be one of those hood classics. Giving us the real on bangin. From WC to Snoop to all those tru ryders, I have to say that hearin each point of view gave me a new way of lookin at their way of livin. From the actual C Walkin to seeing the interviews of the rappers and gangmembers, it was all good.",1091577600,9,326,3.8805970149253732
7992493,4,B00009Q4W0,"Well, this is a cool dvd. At least in my opinion. It gives indept information about the c-walk with different point of views. There is a certain tone in it that points out the sad situation in L.A. So do that crip walk but remember them deaths.
While a lot a rappers talk about makin' theatre, the murder rate is high. So there is the message but it is good, being conscious. If you are a fan of the westcoastgangstash#t, like I am, this dvd is a musthave. The thing I missed was some cool videos. It is foremost a documentary. With appearances from snoop dogg, wc and ice t and most importantly real crips you better be clown walkin', get your Chuck Taylors, crease your khakis  and  create a dialogue about this subculture while doing so.
