8733196,2,B015CVRQ1M,"There is no way this film should have high marks...

Acting is painful...  Dialogue was awful...  Special effects are meh...  anyone who thinks this was unpredictable hasn't watched any movies...

It seems like this movie attempted to copy something of a Troma film, but just ended up falling pretty flat...  It wasn't very funny.  Not scary.  It wasn't all that campy...  Suspense was meh...

I'll take a low budget Troma film ( Terror Firmer comes to mind ) over this any day of the week...

I won't say don't watch it, as it wasn't awful awful...  but I certainly wouldn't set your expectations very high...  and whoever is rating this with 4 and 5 stars is off their rocker...",1518134400,,680,4.61344537815126

  The Women are All Beautiful; & the Blood Flows Freely ! These Ladies are led by Australian Beauty DANI THOMPSON, who happens to be a Fine Actress as well as a Lovely & Buxom Young Lady. SUZI LORRAINE presents us with another Great Performance as a Particularly Nasty & Vindictive Model, quite in Her Element, with this Vicious Group of Amazing Beauties. Which brings me to Fabulous Actress & Scream Queen DEBBIE ROCHON, Who bestows upon us a FlawLess Performance as a Middle-Aged ""Phone-Sex-Girl WannaBe"" !
  For those paying attention, the Killer is apparent; but the Transformation at the End is Nothing Short of 'MAGNIFICENT"" !!!
All the men & women in this Flik are Far more than adequate in this Blood & Guts ""Gore Fest""; & the Story is ""Top Shelf"" !!!",1470528000,,833,4.724137931034483
8733199,2,B015CVRQ1M,"Sexy Internet models from Babelicious.com are being killed. We know it is the kid we saw in the flashback from 30 years ago, but who is that now? The banter between the girls and the cast makes up most of the film and it was second rate dialogue, unconvincingly delivered by actresses who couldn't buy into it either. The blood scenes were low budget and the nightclub scene was downright cheap.

The main sell point of the film is Dani Thompson's cleavage as she keeps her top on, the film's largest disappointment as they teased us by keeping her alive. The film lacked the comedy and nudity for  ""B"" campy slasher.

8733200,5,B015CVRQ1M,"What a STRANGELY ADDICTIVE film this is!! It kind of reminds me, in a way, like Videodrome!

I give this movie 5 STARS because it's a quirky and fun horror movie to watch! Especially with the cut-scenes in-between the horror killings.

The ending made me laugh out loud, just out of a crazed and guilty pleasure!! I won't spoil it for people here. You'd have to watch the movie for yourself. But I enjoyed the gradual build-up of his movie up until the very red-filled end.

I think the cheesy parts of this film, the strange-edgy instrumental music that runs throughout the movie and the strange cut scenes make this movie really fun to watch! A REALLY GREAT INDIE HORROR FILM!!

And oh yes....it's A BRITISH HORROR FILM!! I like this film quite a bit! A FUN HORROR FILM TO WATCH!! It's time for plastic surgery to begin! :)",1456012800,,825,4.516778523489933
8733201,3,B015CVRQ1M,I wanted to give this film a 2 1/2 stars....The first half of this film is not the best...but the second half of the film picks up and finishes pretty well..plus look at the lineup.,1454371200,,181,4.2
