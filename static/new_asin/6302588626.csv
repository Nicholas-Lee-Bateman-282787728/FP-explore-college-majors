482643,4,6302588626,This was more a study in human fallibility than war per se. A story of two groups of soldiers on opposite sides in WWII who have reached the point of wondering just what it is they are fighting for.  If this movie  accomplishes nothing else it is a good portrayal of the insanity of war.  It defines the likenesses of the two opposing groups while downplaying  their differences and in the end reaches the conclusion that we share this  big old world and should be able to reach some accommodation with each  other.  From the opening scenes where Gary Sinise as the nearly insane  character Mother strips naked while running through a snowy forrest to the  point where Mother shoots the bullet that destroys the agreement reached  between his unit and the Germans it is a story of the human fight for  survival.,920764800,,811,4.601398601398602

482772,4,6302588626,"I saw A MIDNIGHT CLEAR (1992, from William Wharton novel) about the time it was first released (on cable tv) and it had always been fairly easy to remember:  The pre-WW2 flashback of soldiers going into town to lose virginity (oh that resolution...); the snowball fight, Christmas Eve and the somewhere in Europe (turns out Ardennes Forest near French border) snow is deep and everywhere; and ""O, tannenbaum..."".  The battle scenes came back to me as I watched again.  A MIDNIGHT CLEAR does get violent despite what is at the heart of this movie:  an Anti-war movie.  Heck, there is even one character in the squad (6 young men remain from 12) the rest call ""mother"" because he is somewhat of a nag and is the oldest at 26 years old (Gary Sinise).  There is another character they call ""Father"" (Frank Whaley) because he had planned on becoming a priest but he didn't/hadn't finished Seminary school.  This ain't no collection of badass soldiers.
Ethan Hawke is (newly sworn in, sort of) Sergeant William Knot (aka Will KNot) who his superiors call ""Won't"".  He is a Sergeant basically by default.  He narrates in appropriately deadpan notes especially since a good portion of his comments directed at the military drips with (Ethan Hawke's) humble sarcasm:  It is no surprise their Squad leader (John C McGinley) was a mortician before the war (that joke is TOO obvious actually).
.
This is a good movie great to see again with my picture ""transfer"" adequate (Nighttime scenes) to good (Daylight scenes).  This is NOT Widescreen as advertised.  This dvd was made in Korea and there are writing ""symbols"" on the back for movie description.  There is some English for cast and crew listing.
BUT,
I have to point out when I put dvd in, the movie A MIDNIGHT CLEAR was already ON moving directly into the credits.  Subtitles in Korean.  I could not get to Main Menu by pushing button on remote.  I pushed the Stop twice to start over and, eventually, subtitles gone w/o going to Main Menu (go figure this was a first).  At end of movie I did, finally, find the Main Menu making sure subtitles off et cetera.
If you don't mind the possible, take-a-deep breath hassle this should be worth seeing again.

By the way I was always shocked that Writer/Director Keith Gordon is the same young actor who was Angie Dickinson's, trying to solve the murder, son in ""Dressed to Kill""; as well as troubled, nerdy cum rebel in killer car movie ""Christine""; and Rodney Dangerfields's son in comedy ""Back to School"".  Never woulda' guessed Gordon directing and adapting/writing a sensitive, well thought out WW2 movie.
He also directed and wrote ""The Chocolate War"" in 1988.  In 1986 he was playing a college freshman to Rodney's millionaire ""Melon"" dad which has me wondering just how old was Gordon when playing a freshman in '86.",1485734400,3,2812,4.758762886597938

As with war itself, happy endings are relative and this film, which follows a team of six recon soldiers and their encounter with a group of German soldiers at Christmas during WW2. The performances by Ethan Hawke, Frank Whaley, Gary Sinese and company (all at the start of their careers at the time) are grounded and the score by Mark Isham (Never Cry Wolf, Once Upon A Time) underscores the unreality of war and it's often tragic consequences.

483091,5,6302588626,"Powerful cinematography and beautiful scoring support this story that is replete with actors nearing the peak of their greatness.  I am certain that this movie contains historical inaccuracies that would draw the attention of a history buff.  This story is not directed at this audience.

This movie is not so much an anti-war movie as one which portrays the human, emotional, and spiritual cost of war.  In this way, soldiers on both sides of the war are very much the exact same.  Soldiers fight for the lives of their friends and for the ability to get home to their families.  This too is a common denominator of both sides.

Wars may be a necessary aspect of the human condition.  Evil must be confronted, fought, and conquered or it will flourish everywhere.  This said, even righteous wars are fought at tremendous and sometimes unbearable human cost.  This movie conveys the tragedy of war while also demonstrating the participants' extraordinary efforts to retain their humanity.

Set in the pictoresque and camera-friendly French Ardennes, this movie is saturated with symbolism and meaning that extends beyond the backdrop of the beautiful Christmas setting.  This movie is a must have for those who love fine film!

It does revolve around a Christmas truce, but this is a story of young, befogged soldiers trying to hang on, not Christmas cheer.  It starts on a surreal note and settles into a realistic, straightforward, sometimes wry narrative of friendship and loss among grinding senselessness.  It doesn't spare tragedy, but doesn't leave out what meaning can be found in war.  (The quote I've put in the title is from one of the soldiers about some paintings.  He adds, ""Try to remember who the real enemy is."")  Some fine dialogue is delivered in believably down-to-earth fashion.  Some of the images, several concerning the treatment of a dead comrade, are unforgettable, heartbreaking and heartening.

When this film was made, it broke new ground in how war was portrayed.  It doesn't contain long battle sequences, but the makers of Saving Private Ryan looked to it as a model.  As a small, independent film, it's not well known, but it's well loved by many who have seen it, including veterans who appreciate situations and characters they can recognize as in few other films.

There has rightly been complaint about the lack of a widescreen version; otherwise the DVD presentation is excellent.  The image quality is good, and the special features are well done.  The audio commentary with director Keith Gordon and star Ethan Hawke is packed with memories about how the film was made, the reasoning behind editing and other choices, and thoughts about the meaning.  It's easy to tell this was an important film for both of them, as it was for many others who worked on it.  Among other things, the commentary gives a better appreciation of what a fine result they got with very limited resources.  There are also ten substantial deleted or alternate scenes, with optional director's commentary.

This DVD is out of print, but if you can't afford to buy a copy at the high cost it goes for now, it's no doubt available from sources like Netflix for rental.

Not to be missed for fans of serious war films or studies in human nature.",1261699200,,2318,4.83248730964467

483224,4,6302588626,"I watch this film every Christmas Season. Odd choice? Well, if you consider that the Season is about ""peace,good will to all"" then yes. A MIDNIGHT CLEAR is a look at the two small platoons of beleagured soldiers from America and Germany (who make it quite clear that they are not Nazis, and the F%$# Hitler!) who meet quite unexpectedly in the Ardennes Woods in December 1944 in the final year of WW2. The point of the film is to show that War is not all that some glorify it to be. This is a ""different"" approach to War, much like the recent LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA where human faces and emotions are placed upon both ""the home team"" and ""the enemy."" That both of these platoons discover each other at Christmas and exchange gifts,songs and negotiate a ""surrender"" removes us from the battlefield and allows us to examine the lives and the feelings of ""greenhorns"" weary of War. This film does not end on a happy note, but rather on an note of irony;War goes on and lives are still infected and affected.
The book from which this film derives it's source is autobiographical, and much more absorbing than the film, but the film still does an excellent job at recreating the intensity of emotion that is in William Wharton's book. One scene when they are ""anointing"" their fallen comrade is quite surreal!
A great companion film to this would be JOYEUX NOEL which tells a similar story about friendly troop exchange during WW1 and I believe to be the better of the two films. DAS BOOT is also another WW2 film that helps us  see ""the other side"" as human. Warmongers will doubtlessly not find this film intriguing I should imagine!

483227,2,6302588626,"A Midnight Clear (Keith Gordon, 2002)

Keith Gordon will probably be best remembered for playing Arnie Cunningham in John Carpenter's so-so film version of Stephen King's so-so novel Christine. Gordon, however, hung up the acting togs in the late eighties and went behind the camera, and it is here he has truly shined, turning out such brilliant movies as Waking the Dead and television genius on such series as House, Dexter, and Homicide: Life on the Street. The man has an amazing track record. So it's with some confusion that I regard those works where Gordon comes off as being somewhat less accomplished. A Midnight Clear is one of them.

Based on a novel by William Wharton, A Midnight Clear is the story of a World War II platoon (full of misfits, natch) who are ordered to scout out a mansion inside enemy territory. They encounter the enemy-- but not an enemy they expect. The survivors of a German platoon are in a house down the hill looking to surrender. The two groups spend a companionable Christmas together before they turn to the task of deciding how to get each other out of the situation they've found themselves in-- enemies in wartime becoming friends.

This is not your typical war film; characterization is much more important than action here, and as in many other substandard war films of this stripe (Hart's War and Tigerland immediately come to mind), it almost seems as if the director wanted to still play it as an action film. There's not enough real character development here to float the entire movie; we get to know our main character well enough, and the character upon whom the entire plot will turn later. We get a little less on the guy who's here for the purpose of building sympathy. On the rest of the platoon, very little, and on the enemy, nothing. We know more about the back-line lieutenant-- a minor character at best-- than we do about the Germans.

Not up to the standards set by either Gordon or Wharton. **",1166572800,,1959,4.6695652173913045

For example, We Were Soldiers is as realistic as possible portrayal of soldiers and their familys, Apocolypse Now is surealism, Full Metal Jacket and Catch 22 are satire. Unless a movie is totally stupid, judging it by how 'accurate' it is has been getting really irritating. It's a trend that's been going on since saving private ryan and it really misses the point of the stories and ideas being expressed.

It's like saying 'I didn't like Blade Runner because there are no such things as Robots' 'I hated Finding Nemo because fish don't talk.""

The original took place in WWI; this one is ""updated"" to WWII. (Paul McCartney even used the storyline in an early music video-- Tug of War, I think.) But never has the story been told so eloquently and beautifully as in this film.

483282,4,6302588626,"I'll admit--I loved the movie, the scenery in winter, the temporary ""rapproachement"" between U.S. GIs and German Wehrbacht soldiers (who insist they are not ""NAZIs"").

The story begins as the remaining 6 of a detatchment of ""whiz kids"" (scoring over 150 I.Q. on the Army exam) who constituted an ""intelligence unit"" are sent forward to an isolated house to do recon--that is, to inform their superiors (including a captain who was an undertaker and has the concomitant charm)....

After setting up quarters in the isolated villa, the recon boys discover they have pitched their quarters a stone's throw away from a small detachment of Wehrmacht soldiers--and older man with young boys.  They swap antics--building a snowman with a Hitler mustache by the GIs, and a snowballfight started by the Germans.

I won't disclose what makes the film ultimately so touching and tragic...suffice it to say, there are good performances by future stars (e.g., Ethan Hawke).  Anyone can identify with these youths stuck in the impossible situation--on the picket line of World War.

The screenplay is excellent, the cinematography is as well.  My only criticism--the only man on the U.S. side who knows any German turns out to be the only Jew.  And, as is typical of American films, he is portrayed as somewhat of a buffoon--lacking self-confidence, even though without him no negotiations with the Germans could take place, even with his broken Yiddish.  He attributes most pitfalls to his being Jewish--therefore the Germans could not trust him, he is not manly enough.  I was sad to see this portrayal, as well as the blonde, tall American being designated as the only one ""Aryan-looking"" enough to pose as an officer in negotiations with the Germans.

Nonetheless, Gary Sinese and Ethan Hawke in particular play their roles with heart, and we can imagine what it may have been like in December, 1944, just before the Battle of the Bulge, to have been stuck, as a young man, facing a dreaded enemy at the most poignant time of year.  And for those reasons, I do recommend this 1992 film.",1134086400,14,2076,4.9510086455331415
483283,4,6302588626,"A MIDNIGHT CLEAR is nearly my favorite Christmas movie.  I was born on Christmas Eve and have had a sentimental attachment to movies laid during Christmas time.  Some reviewers have suggested that this movie is not sentimental, but I think automatically once you have two opposing armies laying down arms in the spirit of Christmas, it gets a little gooey.  Ethan Hawke, so good in the recent remake of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, again battles the snow in A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, as he and five other US grunts try to make sense out of the quandaries of a slow-moving war right before the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes Forest.  His commentary reveals that the movie was actually filmed in the rocky ridges of Utah.

The war's almost over, the invasion a success, admittedly a great, unexpected resistance from German armies means that there's a long winter ahead of them, but as in Wharton's novel when they occupy (and more importantly, to secure) an ancient chateau and start to feel comfortable, an eerie sound floats through the crystalline night air at night-the sound of German laughter.  They are not alone.  Hawke plays a sergeant really not far removed from boyhood, while the Germans, who soon become their prisoners in name, are a mixture of older man and really young boy, for the prime specimens of ""Aryan manhood"" were long ago drained off into the draft and likely as not killed in Stalingrad, and now (at any rate this battalion of the German army), you see the dregs and the far-fetched.  A children's crusade.

Children all, and their ""mother,"" Wilkins (Gary Sinise, doing some interesting work) strips down to nothing in the snow hoping to get a Section Eight (discharge for madness).  As we find out, he has had some terrible news from the States and just wants to get home as quickly as possible.  Arye Gross. a capable actor who used to be in every other movie back then, plays the Yiddish-speaking Stan, the only man among them able to communicate with the Germans.  As his fellow soldiers start calling Will Knott ""Won't"" naturally the viewer starts thinking of him as Melville's Bartleby, the man who politely refused to co-operate and thereby threw a monkey wrench into capitalism.  But this analogy is far-fetched as the concept of a ""separate peace"" at Christmas.  Nevertheless, when the title song breaks through on the soundtrack my eyes start to mist over because I know that something awful will come to break the peace.  After you see this movie you will never look at a snowman with the same happy gaze.",1126137600,23,2534,4.7534246575342465
483284,5,6302588626,"""A Midnight Clear"" is far more truthful and thought provoking than other movies that manipulate (""Saving Private Ryan"") or outright lie (""Blackhawk Down"") to make their point.

From Page 11 of the William Wharton novel on which the movie is based:

""When I say lost, I mean killed.  Nobody in the army ever admits someone on our side is killed.  They're either lost, like Christopher Robin; hit, as in a batter hit by a pitched ball, take your base, or they get 'it,' as in a hide-and-seek, or, maybe, 'get it,' as with an ambiguous joke.""

These lines are just about identical to naration in the movie.

Will Wharton served in US Army Intelligence in WW II.  He moved to France after the horrors of WW II and he became disenchanted with American life.  ""A Midnight Clear,"" while fiction, is also autobiographical.  To suggest that it is ""unrealistic"" is just false.  The man wrote (and the movie depicts) much of what the man experienced!  (His book ""Franky Furbo"" explores some of the same fiction and biographical themes but in a far more fantastical way.)

As a former US Army Intelligence Analyst myself (1980s) I have to say that this is probably the best military movie I've ever seen.  It shows both how naive the young intel soldiers are and how brutal the Army can be when dealing with those who even remotely challenge the system.  In the end it shows the futility of it all - not just war, but also the actions of the intel unit that thought it could live a different life than what the Army wanted for them.

I can see why the rah-rah types might hate this movie.  It challenges the status quo, the idea of the ""good war"" and the whole ""suck it up and deal with it"" military attitude.  This doesn't make the movie and book unrealistic.  Rather, it is dangerous to those who want to paint a different kind of picture of what war is like.",1117411200,33,1849,4.485029940119761

War films are now judged by my gold standards such as BlackHawk Down, When Trumpets Fade, and Platoon.  With that said, this movie does a fair job showing the pain of war.  But the behavior of the soldiers on both sides is complete nonsense.  The way in which the Germans contact the I&R squad, the ""plan"", and even the ""disaster"" (which any thinking person saw coming a mile away) were so difficult to believe as to ruin the rest of the movie.  The way in which the soldiers set up their position makes anyone who has military experince realize the film is going to be silly before it gets REALLY unbelievable.

483289,5,6302588626,"As I saw this film and Castle Keep again recently, I thought about Stanley Weintraub's book Silent Night in which he discusses a brief period prior to Christmas in 1914, on the battlefields of Flanders, when German and British soldiers spontaneously agreed to declare a truce and suspend fighting, thereby defying their commanding officers. Centuries ago, knights and their attendants would work with their enemies to clear a field for combat the next day. Such cooperation had an obvious practical value. That's not what interests Weintraub as he examines a temporary truce during one of the bloodiest wars ever fought. It had little (if any) practical or tactical value but it did (and does) suggest a human need which transcends military obligations. However, war is war. After a brief respite, the carnage inevitably resumes.

A Midnight Clear was directed by Keith Gordon and is based on William Wharton's autobiographical novel. Rather than featuring a star such as Burt Lancaster (as in Castle Keep), the lead roles in this film are played by those normally seen in supporting roles. For example, Kevin Dillon, Ethan Hawke, and Gary Sinise. They and all others in the cast are first-rate. Basically, here's the situation. An elite U.S. Army intelligence unit is given a reconnaissance mission in the Ardennes Forest in December of 1944, just before the Battle of the Bulge. The men in the platoon may be far from home as Christmas approaches, lonely and miserably cold, but they retain a certain playful spirit comparable with what Robert Altman celebrates in M.A.S.H. They encounter a German unit and then....

While seeing this film the first time and then again recently, I felt as if I were dreaming that I had returned to the 1940s in a time machine, to Belgium near the end of World War Two. Credit Tom Richmond's cinematography with creating an uncommonly beautiful setting for the savage combat which occurs there, as does John Mathieson during the ""Hell Unleashed"" sequence early in Gladiator. The dreamlike atmosphere continues throughout as the men suspend and then resume their own involvement in the war. This is a haunting film, at times an exquisitely lovely film, but also one which raises some serious questions. Why not throw snow balls instead of grenades, then treat each other to a round of drinks? Why not celebrate Christmas together, exchanging gifts and singing carols, as their ancestors once did on Christmas Eve in 1914, on the battlefields of Flanders? Doesn't all that make much more sense than killing each other? Of course. It's just that....",1079740800,84,2581,5.04215456674473

It is one of a small group of war films that occupy a privileged place in the pantheon of this genre. Others in this class include for me ""Gallipoli,"" ""The Thin Red Line,"" and ""Platoon."" Of course, to mention these ""war"" films is to say at once ""anti-war"" because their whole point is to illustrate the brutality and futility of military action, to decry the ultimate human folly of settling differences by killing other human beings.

Set during the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes forest, a squad of six green American soldiers is sent on a mission to do reconnisance on enemy activity in the area.  Fear and tension build as the greenhorn recruits search for the enemy.  But when they finally discover the German camp, they find a small band of soldiers not unlike themselves; scared, cold, and wondering why they are fighting this war anyway.  A tentative truce is formed between the Germans and Americans, and they even celebrate Christmas together.  But soon the truce explodes into horrifying violence.
An all-star cast graces the screen in this film.  Ethan Hawke stars as Sgt. William (Will) Knott, the leader of the squad.  The viewer also hears narration of the movie through his voice. Gary Sinise plays ""Mother"", a twenty-six year old vet who has just found out that his two-day old child has died.  Frank Whaley is ""Father"", a seminary school drop-out who still harbors his religious training.  He even forged an agreement with the squad not to use profanity, but you'll see how far that goes.

Midnight Clear is the story of a group of American Soldiers, led by ""Will Knott"" aka ""Don't, "" who are entrenched behind enemy lines in war torn Germany. Sent to occupy a rural farmhouse, the soldiers soon discover they are not alone. They share the sector with a small group of enemy soldiers. Over time, boredom, fatigue, and anxiety get the better of the soldiers, and they begin to contact with eachother. Eventually harmless pranks turn to friendship.
After exchanging Christmas presents and Christmas Cheer, the American's and Germans hatch an unlikely plan to bring peace to their small region of the Ardennes Forest - with life-changing consequences.
I really loved this film! It was poignant, moving and tragic. I loved the acting by Ethan Hawke and Gary Sinise. This movie is a must for fans of character-driven drama.",1038268800,10,852,4.965034965034965

Beautiful scenery, wonderful acting and story, and altogether an incredible slice of GI life in wartime Germany, 1944.

This movie will knock your socks off.  Flawlessly directed and envisioned.  My only gripe is the pan-and-scan.  What the - ?  This movie is so beautiful that not putting it on widescreen is a crime.  If this movie wasn't shot in the Ardennes, it was a close runner-up.

I highly suggest this movie for purchase as part of your movie collection.  The cast is full of stars and future stars for the time (1992).  I highly doubt this movie will ever be dated, since it feels just as fresh in 2002 as it did in 1992.

483402,3,6302588626,"This movie is good, but once I found out that it was filmed in Utah, I could not imagine the story taking place in the Belgium forest (the high mountains in the background scenery gives the location away).
Also, I think the plot would have been more believable if it had occured AFTER the Battle of the Bulge. The screenwriter forgot that this major German offensive caught the American frontline forces completely by surprise. Watching the Intelligence squad's four survivors escape in a jeep during the German attack on the chateau is Hollywood cliche', and then seeing the four guys carry a corpse around for miles while on foot, and encountering NO Germans, is completely bogus.
Oh well, I guess there simply isn't any war movie that is truly believable.

The bright, snowbound locations are tailor-made for DVD, with rich, vibrant colours that translate onto DVD with appropriate sharpness; even the interiors, often lit with available light (and not much of it), are not lacking for sharpness or clarity. Mark Isham's solemn, elegiac and often hypnotic electronic score has been realized nicely in digital stereo; the sound effects, too, pack a mean punch.
But what on earth were they thinking when they issued thbis DVD as a pan-and-scan hatchet job, without even the option of a widescreen transfer to choose from? Some of the cinematography in this film is remarkable; to not even have the option of seeing it  in  1:85 is unforgiveable.
Adding to the mystery: audio commentary by Ethan Hawke and Keith Gordon. Somebody went to some effort to give this disc an added dimension. So why no widescreen transfer?

483462,2,6302588626,"The snowy mountains of Utah double as the Belgian Ardennes in this World War Two odyssey.  A MIDNIGHT CLEAR is an attempt at creating a serious version of WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR DADDY?

A war weary squad of infantrymen is sent forward to gather intelligence.  Tired of being at the forefront of every mission, the soldiers arrange a separate peace with their German counterparts only to witness their short-lived ceasefire collapse.

The Battle of the Bulge is twisted and distorted as the backdrop for this movie, but there is very little similarity here between that great battle and this backyard fantasy.  Traditionally, the Battle of the Bulge has not been treated very well in films.  The exceptions are PATTON, BAND OF BROTHERS and BATTLEGROUND.  The accuracy of A MIDNIGHT CLEAR is called into question in the first couple minutes of the movie as subtitle notes the locale as the Ardennes and mistakenly describes the Ardennes as being located on the German-French frontier.  Sorry folks, the Battle of the Bulge took place in Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium.

Do not expect to see any big budget sets or recreations of German fortifications.  For the most part this film takes place in the woods and the snow.  On a positive note, the dialogue between the soldiers in the squad is realistic and the basic training flashback sequence is interesting.  If you are a World War Two film buff, then this film should probably find its way into your Battle of the Bulge collection.

It is a non-traditional stary that doesn't have a lot of shoot em up action but is more of an emotional story set during the American advance through France.  The lead character I felt was kinda weak in the actors performance but the story called for a very boyish soldier barely old enough to be in the Army who is made a leader.  The small patrol is stationed on the outskirts of the American line and they encounter some very strange Germans.  It is their dealings with the Garmans nearby that bring out their emotions and feelings and the story is unique in how it portrays the German Army as being little different than the Americans.  Not every German was a Nazi and this film really touches on that point.  The film is well done and great to watch. The end is a bit of a shocker and quite emotional.,1014422400,,871,4.280487804878049

483465,5,6302588626,"December 1944--A team of rookie American soldiers are put to the test as they go on a mission to the German Front.  They don't really know whether they really believe in putting their lives at stake, and soon they happen upon a group of German soldiers in the forest.  They discover, however, that the German soldiers don't want to fight any more than they do, and so a tentative truce is called between the soldiers as they spend Christmas together.  One deadly mistake, however, soon leads to a terrible tragedy that will haunt young Private Will Knott for the rest of his life.
This is a deeply moving and highly underrated anti-war film that's not even available on DVD.  It's a lot more complex and less grisly than ""Saving Private Ryan"".  I was a little surprised at some of the similarities in this film to the classic anti-war novel __All Quiet on the Western Front__ by Erich Maria Remarque.  But that's a good thing; all the characters are so well developed and do such a great job of displaying their emotions (my personal favorite was Gary Sinise as ""Mother"").
The dialogue is thoroughly thought-provoking, especially the lines spoken by ""Mother"" in the scene with the painting; how ""somebody cared"" and ""somebody made something...probably not even for money, but for love"" in a time when so many people ""wonder if there is any love left.""  There are also a few humorous lines here and there (like when everyone started calling Private Will Knott by the name of ""Won't""), and the scene with the bathtub is sure to tug at your heartstrings.  Also, the ending isn't as predictable as you may think it might be.
If you're looking for an unusually non-violent and tender anti-war drama, and if you don't mind the unhurried pace, frequent dialogue, and relatiely little action, then I can't think of a better film for you to see this holiday season.  ""A Midnight Clear"" is a masterpiece.
Rated R, mostly for language.  There are a few brief images of war violence, but no prolonged gore.  There is also a scene involving an encounter between the soldiers and a prostitute, but there's no nudity.

In most movies, there is always something off.  Either the story is just okay and the cinematography is phenomenal, or the acting is stellar and the direction is weak.  Not for this movie.  Everything is dead on picture-perfect.  The cinematography is stunning and perfectly timed, the acting is incredibly high-caliber, the storyline is tight and difficult to second-guess, and it moves along at exactly the right pace.  Perfect in every way.
Regarding the story, it is very moving on a number of levels.  You become very much involved in the plot, and even as a casual viewer, you can easily empathize with and almost participate in the situation these young men are in.  The symbolism is frequent, yet still easily grasped by the common man, making it that much more effective.
Please don't pay heed to those on here who give this movie a poor review.  It will be a viewing you will cherish forever, simply for the fact that it captures the human condition, with its innumerable facets, very well in a short timeframe.  It's unbelievably sad and almost unacceptable to think that this movie came and went without notice.
The symbol in the opening sequence, the statue of the archbishop holding his head in his hands, perfectly encapsulates the sentiment of the movie.  Mankind, with all of its structures, methodoligies, and education, is completely unable to obstruct devastation, tragedy, and time, regardless of the purity we try to emulate.  In the end, our collective heads are obtusely disconnected from our bodies and actions.
If you're looking for bang-bang kill-kill war drama, or if you aren't able to process the writing on your cereal box intellectually, pass this movie up.  Otherwise, it is a must see.  I own it and have shown it to 15 people at different times and places.  None were disappointed.

A Midnight Clear also has a very good cast with future stars in the ranks. The acting is convincing and character development is well played out through the film.

483531,5,6302588626,"In this ""pacifist"" drama, director Keith Gordon tells the story of William Wharton's autobiographical novel by following a small intelligence patrol on the German front in 1944. The film is moving and thought provoking, but not a war movie for every man. The Battle of the Bulge was the last major German offensive on the Western Front. Under Hitler's direct orders the German Army transferred men and materiel from the Eastern Front, permitting the Russians to gain ground at the rate of 100 miles per day. The plan was to break through the Allied lines and push to the sea at Antwerp and Lieges. The attack began on December 16, 1944. The Germans broke through in the Ardennes Forest making a huge bulge in the Allied lines. The allies were not able to turn the Germans back until January 16, 1945. The Battle of the Bulge cost 77,000 Allied casualties and 220,000 German casualties.  This is the background for the story of a World War Two American intelligence unit posted to a remote location of the Ardennes Forest at the time of the Battle of the Bulge. At Christmas the American soldiers receive a message from a German Army unit that it wants to surrender. The hitch is that the Germans want it to appear that they were overwhelmed to make sure that there will be no reprisals to their families back in Germany. The movie shows the soldiers trying to work this out. They fail. Some American soldiers are killed and the German unit is wiped out The story of the film unfolds slowly. The audience has time to get to know each of the characters and their motivations. This makes the film more intimate, because the audience feels closer to the film and the characters.  The beauty of the imagery and scenery adds to the pleasure of the film. The scenery serves to add to the overall message and the feeling of Christmas. The sea of snow is so real and wonderful; I could almost feel the wind on my cheeks.  The truth is that this movie is not about war; it is about peace. The Germans want peace, and the Americans want peace. The story is highly moving and full of hope. The Americans are presented with a situation where they can show compassion for their fellow men and practice what they have been taught. The GI's can ""love thine enemy"" and be the guardians of peace.  The story sounds sappy and there is not a lot of fighting involved, so it is really a war movie for the smart person. The film also gives a sympathetic view of the average non-Nazi German. The movie shows the fear felt by soldiers and the difficulties in establishing trust between enemies. It shows that German soldiers had feelings too. This movie is deeply upsetting in the way that any good war movie should be. It brings several elements of the horror of war into clear perspective.",995241600,9,2767,4.561368209255533

The poignancy is truly heartfelt in scenes when the 19 year-old American soldiers confronted their German counterparts in the Ardennes countryside, who want nothing better than to have snowball fights and celebrate gifts and singing Christmas carols. Though more a ""pacifist"" movie, the depictions of the violence of war was a necessity, only to prove a point, that war IS violent and insane and that any teenager or chirldren thrown in the situation, would try to make the best of situation and their spirit will withstand the ugliness of the situation. Befitting that the violence is set against the backdop of a blanket of pure white snow (by the way, what is it with Ethan Hawke and snow - Dead Poet's Society, White Fang ...)

The plot is based on the authors own war-experience, and on other well documented ""Christmas truces"" during WW1. The American soldiers  in the story, who, if presented with a combat situation would probably have  shown  the same degree of bravery as any others in their army, are given  the opportunity to show initiative combined with compassion, in trying to  arrange the surrender of a small group of  disillusioned Germans. They  are presented with a  unique opportunity to practice the ethic ""love  thine enemy"", exactly at the season when one of  the most  significant advocates of that idea is  celebrated! The realistic story  makes it clear  why it is not ""sappy"" or ""corny"" to  wish to show  kindness to your fellow-human.

7827747,5,6302588626,A very intriguing and involving film.  I watch it every Christmastime to feel appreciation for all that I have an how lucky I am.  Especially interesting to see the cast members when they were so young and comparatively unknown.,1515110400,,228,4.82051282051282
7827748,5,6302588626,One of my very favorite movies!  Excellent cast and such a good story.  I cry each time we watch it.  Wonderful,1514851200,,111,4.190476190476191
7827749,4,6302588626,"this is a great movie.  too bad my copy of the dvd kept hanging up and getting stuck on a certain chapter which rendered watching all the way through impossible, even after cleaning it, the player & trying it in a wholly different player.  so 5 stars for the film itself, 1 star for the condition of the dvd, which should average out to 3, but the story is just so damned good, i had to add another star.  [i've seen the movie prior and this was suppose to be a replacement for my current VHS copy that i've been so reluctant to part with].",1513728000,,540,4.123809523809523
7827750,5,6302588626,"This is a wonderful movie that deserves a decent release on DVD and Blu Ray, with the proper aspect ratio and a good remastering. It's been so overlooked for such treatment over the years.",1513468800,,188,4.5588235294117645
7827751,1,6302588626,The version of this DVD in English that was imported from Korea and available with Korean Sub-titles is mislabeled as a widescreen version (1.85:1)  The movie on the disk itself is actually the full screen version with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1.,1510185600,,245,4.833333333333333
7827752,5,6302588626,Excellent and not so well known in film literature books movie. It has a very firm anti war message that I truly enjoy it.,1508630400,,122,4.125
7827753,5,6302588626,The blue ray was excellent quality,1504310400,,34,4.833333333333333
