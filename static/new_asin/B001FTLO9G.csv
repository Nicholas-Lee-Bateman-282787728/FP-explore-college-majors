3589119,5,B001FTLO9G,"When I first saw previews for Wisegal I knew that I wanted to see it. It had a great cast and a great storyline. Turns out it was better than what I thought it would be. Alyssa Milano gives a great performance throughout the movie and she really ""sells"" her character. If you like Lifetime movies OR Alyssa Milano then I think you'll like this movie.

Short Storyline: Patty's (Alyssa Milano) husband dies and she doesn't know how to support her family anymore. She meets a guy who is in the mob which she doesn't know at first. She needs money to support her family so she goes to work for him. Throughout the movie Patty learns more and more about the mob and the guy that she doesn't like until finally she tries to get out. Watch the movie to see if Patty can make it out of the mob...

Again I thought this was an excellent movie and the acting was amazing.",1232755200,13,862,4.25
3589120,4,B001FTLO9G,It was well written and showed a struggling mother doing what she had to do for her family.  Good acting too.,1231200000,2,109,4.190476190476191
3589121,2,B001FTLO9G,"When I saw this DVD on the shelf at the video store, I thought ""Oh, a mob movie starring Alyssa Milano, James Caan, and some guy I've never heard of. Cool"". I read the description on the back of the DVD which basically describes Milano's character as a widowed mother who takes an opportunity to work with the mob in order to support her children. Since I knew nothing about this film, I checked the rating and saw that it was 'Not Rated', which doesn't mean a whole lot. It could either be really violent and bloody or it could be a children's movie for all I knew. Hoping that it would be the former, I took a chance with it and decided to get the movie. Well, I should have read a little bit closer... it turns out that WISEGAL is a Lifetime Television movie that was shown on Cable early in 2008 and now released on DVD. If you don't know what Lifetime is... do you know the channel that your mom or grandma (or wife, depending on how old you are) sits on the couch and watches religiously that has all of those corny Dramas usually featuring a female in the lead role? That's Lifetime.

I figured since I already got the movie I may as well watch it. It turns out that overall it actually isn't that bad. I mean, Alyssa Milano is drop dead gorgeous and is the reason I got it in the first place. She actually is the leading woman in the movie and it isn't a case of her making a cameo and having her name and face plastered on the front cover in order to trick people into watching it like other movies do (not necessarily with Milano, but with any established actor or actress starring in a B-Movie). Alyssa's character in the film is hired by a mob boss (James Caan) to basically serve as someone who smuggles a bunch of cash from Canada back into American soil on a regular basis, with the payoff being that her and her kids will be taken care of for the rest of their lives. She's also involved with another mob guy who she met at a funeral home after he husband died, and there's a bunch of drama with that relationship. He's married, has a kid who's dealing drugs and might be an influence on HER two kids, yada yada yada.

Overall, it wasn't a bad movie. However, it's just not my thing and I did have a few problems with it. For one, the dialogue was extremely dumb and cheesy. For example, there was a line in the movie that made me actually go back and watch it a second time just to make sure I didn't hear what I THOUGHT I heard. Alyssa's character is talking to an FBI agent, when the agent says something along the lines of ""your husband was a good man"". Alyssa's character replies ""He gave me a sandwich. It's the first time anyone's ever given me anything"". Huh???? And secondly, every single character in the movie personifies the stereotype of an Italian mobster which is a bit annoying after a while.

The DVD has a short Behind the Scenes featurette which doesn't even really have any interviews with cast and crew, and is basically footage of the production set to background music.

Unless you watch the Lifetime Channel and are into those kinds of movies, then I wouldn't recommend WISEGAL at all. And since it is essentially a Made-for-Television movie, don't expect any grittiness, adult language, violence, or nudity. It's not so much a ""Mob movie"" as it as about Alyssa Milano's character. Not a horrible movie, just not what I was expecting at all and ultimately not a movie I want to see again.

3589138,5,B001FTLO9G,Wisegal is a great movie about a mother who ends up working for criminals and the Mob. It is a great movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon. It is a story about a mother who will do what she has to in order to take care of her family. Movies like Wisegal and The Client List are movie I love because it shows that any mother will do what she has to in order to take care of her family!,1395273600,,383,3.740740740740741

3589140,5,B001FTLO9G,"Despite the good reviews on this movie, I was still hesitant to purchase, but glad I did.  I found the acting excellent especially the work done by Alyssa Milano.  Jason Gedrik also played the part of Frank Russo very authentically; a backstreet hood that reaches the upper levels of the mob.  James Cann was great...in fact, all the actors did their parts well.  I enjoyed every minute of the movie and tried to research these people but found very little of them on the internet, except that Patti was in real life, an amazinging beautiful woman and at 68, she remains so.  I found it funny that someone had not written a book about this amazing woman.  She had guts.",1388448000,2,669,4.533333333333333

3589147,4,B001FTLO9G,"Wisegal ( 2008 ) tells a credible story about the sacrifices that a
young woman must make; raised in modest surroundings, she becomes a
widowed mother at a young age and faced with making ends meet in the
inner city. Alyssa Milano plays that role, demonstrating charisma,
charm, a natural pride in her independence, yet able to face the
reality of taking another husband and taking past hardships in stride,
to deal with life the best as she can. In the meantime, she also
takes part in the underground economy (with cigarettes, etc)
hooking up with the character played  both charismatically and
skillfully by Jason Gedrick, often portrayed in mob dramas.

Next there's the presence of legendary James Caan, who is credible as a
powerful underground figure; yet, in line with past movies, seems
to have trouble finding a bad bone in his body, while suggesting to
viewers that he's well versed in the underground economy (booze, go
go girls, card games, saloons, etc.) The script perhaps could have done
more in leeway to Caan, and more camera time, to develop his character
and improvize somewhat, but what left for viewers is adequate.

No doubt, the movie is skillfully edited, filmed, the narrative well
developed and is entertaining, with some depth in the relationship
laid out between the the characters of Milano and Gedrick, romantic
staying within the bounds of a mainstream audience.

Therefore, for the vigor seen in the actors, their youth and also
in the realism demonstrated, this is a must-see underground movie.",1361145600,,1528,4.980392156862745

3589155,5,B001FTLO9G,"I haven't seen this movie. I'm sure it's very good. BUT why was Patty having an affair with a married Mob captain, when she had two small children to think of? I know she turned to the mob to save her kids? She was worried her sons would become wiseguys? What she think was going to happen?! I can't help but to wonder if she cared more about sleeping with this guy at the time then her kids! I don't believe in passing judgement, I undestand women get lonely, but no woman needs a man.

3589157,3,B001FTLO9G,I admit I had my doubts for this but Alyssa Milano really surprised me for her role in this film.  I thought this movie was decent enough to earn an emmy nomination for Alyssa but unfortunately it did not happen.  I was surprised how smart the character was especially while doing stuff for the mob and taking care of her family.  It shows how different loyalties are when it comes to a family you are working for.  Either way it was real treat to see James Caan in this as well because he always does well in the mafia role.  I recommend this film to anyone who is a big fan of the mafia films.  Hell she is just as good as Lorraine Bracco in Goodfellas and Talia Shire in The Godfather Part II.  For any guy or mafia fan this is good treat.,1270684800,4,742,4.111111111111111

WISEGAL is  the pull-no-punches true story of Patty Montanari, a Brooklyn widow who dared to challenge the Big Apple's most notorious crime family. Co-starring THE GODFATHER'S James Caan and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES' Jason Gedrick and executive produced by Joe Pistone, the inspiration for DONNIE BRASCO, WISEGAL will keep you riveted from opening title to end credits.
