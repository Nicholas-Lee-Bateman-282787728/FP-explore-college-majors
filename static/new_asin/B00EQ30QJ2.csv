I thoroughly enjoyed both. I found Vitality to be very informative and I will use the
information to increase my vitality. I enjoyed that one of the actors wax reading a book,
""The Four Agreements"" that I also happen to be reading now.
I have donated money so that they can work on their new film",1463616000,,361,4.402985074626866

8608427,5,B00EQ30QJ2,"some of the commentators were a bit over the top in their exuberance for intense fitness or diet guidelines.  i find that a few simple tips/commitments to cutting out red meat, eating more beans and lentils, more fruits and veggies, moderate exercise... we don't have to go to extremes, just being a little bit smarter about our meals makes a big difference !",1408579200,2,359,4.698412698412699
