8065728,1,B0009S2KAG,"I made the UNFORGIVABLE mistake of buying this dvd because I wanted to see more of lovely Michelle Bauer.  Back of the dvd case promises that you will see more of her than ever before, which turned out to be a complete and utter lie.  When I first saw this here on Amazon,  2 movies on dvd plus an interview with Michelle, and Burt Ward (Batman) along with a bunch of other extras, I thought, well, if the producers went to all this trouble, must be SOMETHING good about these 2 films I have never heard of.  WRONG.  There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend here.  For a couple of cheesy T and A comedies,  there is ZERO comedy, NO A  at all, and precious little T.

Sad to say, the ONLY remotely, and I mean remotely, interesting thing about this dvd  is the interview with Burt Ward and the writer, actor, director of this wretched pile of drivel.  In between praising this hack  for being such an incredibly talented person, (wayyyyyyyyy, better acting here than the phoned in performance Burt gives in the Nerds 2 ""film"") Burt discusses the Batman tv series, and film, and his life post-batman.

So, in summation, stay FAR, FAR, away from this dvd, unless you enjoy flushing money down the toilet.  Ice cold food at a drive-thru would have been an infinitely better use of the funds I used to acquire  this garbage, along with being way more satisfying.  If you are a new fan of Michelle Bauer, like me, these 2 ""movie""s are NOT good examples of her work.  I wish I had done more research more before ordering this.  ugh.",1419465600,,1525,4.444043321299639
8065729,5,B0009S2KAG,This 2 movie set is classic cult comedy for all nerds and anyone else. Shown on tv stations late night to fill time these movies are somewhat similar to Revenge Of The Nerds but these are more cheesy & cheap but that's why we love them. The girls are a plus also.,1394236800,,263,4.076923076923077
8065730,1,B0009S2KAG,"I can't really understand the draw that this movie has that gets people to follow it, or it to get listed as having a cult following. It's badly acted, and written. Yes it has a couple of b movie queens in it, and I really expected more out of them. The description of the film is very misleading. I expected more than a couple lame jokes, and over done acting. The humor fell short for me as well. The whole party only seemed to last five minutes and the craziest thing to happen was an over the hill porn star looking lady getting cream all over her chest while a lot of 30 somethings playing 21 year olds pretended to be overly interested. Oh and a motorcycle came inside the building for like a minute. Party over, big whoop. Don't fall into the hype on this one unless you want to be disappointed. Seeing Linea Quigely naked for the 100th time isn't really worth it.",1373673600,,871,4.284848484848485
