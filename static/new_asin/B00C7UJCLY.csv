8578434,5,B00C7UJCLY,"How could Verdi be anything but great?  I have not yet viewed every opera in the set, but of those I have I am very pleased.  All are professional with great casts and choruses from the worlds best venues.  La Traviata with Rene Fleming is a special treat, as is Rigoletto, with Marcelo Alvarez, my favorite tenor.  These productions are not current, so we get to see the best in opera in their early careers.  For those of us who live in a city where we seldom get to see the best of the best, this is a great buy.",1453766400,,515,4.11

8578437,1,B00C7UJCLY,"This is a collection of mixed presentations.  From the good, the bad to the very bad.  The opening scene of Rigoletto is a disgusting debauchery.  Evidently the producers felt a porno presentation would be something different.  Here is an example of why in the  early days of theater the common idea was that it was not a place for decent people to participate.  Why, why did they do this to something so beautiful of Verdi?  Don Carlo should be sub-titled ""Opera on the cheap"".  The sets are unbelievably poor quality.  How could this production be chosen to be a part of an expensive Verdi collection?  Surely there must be better ones out there that do justice to a Verdi opera.
Aida is well presented.  A good orchestra and large cast.  Of particular note is the action of setting up the stage shown during the overture.  Unfortunately as good as Aida is it cannot redeem the other offerings.",1427241600,9,896,4.630573248407643
8578438,5,B00C7UJCLY,"For this paltry sum you can own twelve complete recordings of Verdi operas on DVD in mostly marvelous, recent (the oldest from 1998) productions. Look at the fine print on the picture of the back side of this huge box and you'll see. Consider:

From Covent Garden:
Simon Keenlyside in 'Macbeth'
Christine Sch&auml;fer and Marcelo &Aacute;lvarez in 'Rigoletto  (the Rigoletto, Paolo Gavanelli, I'd never heard of but he's good)
Jos&eacute; Cura, Veronica Villarroel and Dmitri Hvorostovsky in 'Trovatore'
Ren&eacute;e Fleming, Joseph Calleja and Thomas Hampson in 'Traviata'
Plac&iacute;do Domingo, Marina Poplavskaya, Ferruccio Furlanetto and Joseph Calleja in 'Simon Boccanegra'
Bryn Terfel and Barbara Frittoli in 'Falstaff'

From the Netherlands Opera:
'Sicilian Vespers' with singers I didn't know but who carry this difficult opera off admirably
Robert Lloyd, Rolando Villazon, Amanda Roocroft in 'Don Carlo'

From the Teatro Real in Madrid:
Marcel &Aacute;lvarez and Violeta Urmana in 'Ballo in maschera'

The Liceu in Barcelona:
Daniela Dessi and Fabio Armiliato in 'Aida'
Jos&eacute; Cura, Krassimira Stoyanova, and Lado Ataneli in 'Otello'

From the Mariinsky Opera in St. Petersburg:
Galina Korchakova, Nikolai Putilin and Gegam Grigorian (Valery Gergiev, conductor) - La Forza del Destino

All of these productions have been reviewed here at Amazon in their single-opera format. You might want to look them up to see what others say about them.

The DVDs are packed in three boxes with swing-out sleeves; there are seventeen DVDs in total (some of the operas take up two DVDs). There is a thick book of notes and synopses (with terrific pictures of the productions). Even if you already own one or two of these, for this price you simply can't go wrong.

Snap this one up.
