8081732,3,B000B5XPGK,"This movie started out with great promise.  The person-in-the-street interviews were so authentic, one must assume that they were ad-libbed, not a bad thing.  And the other elements of the show were incredibly slick, yet in a way that conveyed that the screenwriter, director and production designer all knew exactly what they were doing.  Then, when the actual ""trial"" began, the whole film took a sharp left turn and suddenly became totally implausible.  No judge would or could participate in an extra-legal proceeding in which the public served as a jury of millions (I had assumed that the public vote was parallel to, but did not take the place of, the 12-person jury, but I was wrong).  The final scene, involving a confrontation between the antagonist and several other characters, was so stagy as to be surreal. I was really hoping for a memorable film that dealt with the dark side of an entertainment-based culture, perhaps in the tradition of that venerable classic 1976 film ""Network.""  Despite the potential, ""Citizen Verdict"" falls far short.",1421452800,2,1057,5.045977011494253

8081734,1,B000B5XPGK,this movie goes really slow. Not what we thought it was supposed to be. A reality show is much better.  Did not expect a lot from this movie but it was a total waste of monies!! Don't bother to buy or rent. Not worth it.,1169424000,2,220,3.888888888888889
8081735,4,B000B5XPGK,"With the so-so cover art and Jerry Springer as one of the stars, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised! Great acting, good production and king of scary, when you consider the movie's premise. Overall, not an academy-award winner, but a great evening's entertainment. Armand Assante gives a good performance.",1131494400,5,325,5.269230769230769
