8402011,1,B003PJ1UWU,"There are no English subtitles in this movie.  Since I do not parlez vous, I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.  The product listing should have made note of this.",1373414400,2,168,4.21875
8402012,4,B003PJ1UWU,"If you want to know what it was like to homestead in Quebec in the early 20C, this is an excellent film.  carole Laure is an extraordinary beauty on a farm, watching her mother age prematurely from backbreaking work and dreaming of something different for herself.  At a crossroad in life, she must choose from suitors:  one is a neighbor, devoted to her but expecting them to live like their parents; the other is a kind of adventurer, who promises sensuality and an unsettled life.  Her choice, and what ensues, is unexpected and depressingly realistic.

Recommended.  This is a beautiful indie film that should be offered on dvd.",1280707200,3,632,4.805555555555555
