6355134,5,B00JD9M5IO,"Glenn Ford stars in ""Brotherhood of the Bell,"" a 1970 made-for-TV film.  It is actually a feature-length version of an early Fifties live TV broadcast.  The film deals with a fictitious fraternity - similar to the real Skull and Crossbones society - which is the true Establishment which controls America.  It taps into popular suspicions about how these private organizations have corrupted and undermined our once-democratic society.

It is fascinating and horrifying to see how the protagonist's life unravels after he turns on his benefactors.  His growing paranoia alienates him; he's  unable to trust anyone to help him overthrow ""The Bell.""  Consequently, his credibility is lost; The Bell carries on.

The film is not perfect.  It's often ham-handed, and Ford's character seems so unwary about the consequences of his actions that he loses sympathy.  Nevertheless, this film holds and maintains tension quite well.  It might even have you inwardly questioning the affiliations of every public figure you see, as well as a few people right next to you.

6355135,5,B00JD9M5IO,"Glen Ford, Will Greer are father and son in this movie. It takes this college professor, who thinks he's made it on his own, and turns him inside when a European dissident arrives to expose collaboration with high, American interests with the tyrant at home. Dean Jagger is the senior member that tells Ford what is expected, since he took the oath, and it is not too dissimilar from what other 'secret societies' demand of their members. It's not a lavish movie but it is a substantial one and goes through what would probably really happen to a man in the position of Glen Ford. His son, Peter, was well versed in such organizations and I used to hear his radio show exposing such. Brotherhood of the bell, in general, is a movie on how secret societies and elite groups recruit and control men in influential, though not always, places and explains why institutions of news, education, business, politics...are not doing their jobs for the public but for the private organizations and you can take your pick of them. It's a brave movie without the trappings or too many movies currently being made. It's threadbare of those cliques and strong on meaning.",1441238400,4,1157,4.732673267326732
6355136,5,B00JD9M5IO,"Given the controversial nature of this film, one is tempted to cry 'conspiracy theory' about the fact that it has been unavailable for purchase or rent--anywhere, anytime. Will someone please find that hidden copy in Area 51 and let us see it again??",1407628800,8,250,4.837209302325581
8649808,5,B00JD9M5IO,"WOW, based on the skull and bones secret society and I understand it was not available to see or purchase for years. Trump is not a member, btw.",1532390400,,144,4.178571428571429

8649810,5,B00JD9M5IO,Great older movie with current theme. Glen Ford was great.,1517270400,,58,4.9
8649811,5,B00JD9M5IO,"My bucket list includes teaching a college course on conspiracy theory.  So dream with me for a moment.  This movie would be the homework assignment before the first class.  Dean Jagger and William Conrad stand out in a brilliant cast.  All the basic elements of an inter-generational conspiracy/cult reaching into politics, media, academia, and the corporate world are shown here.

The reading list would include Webster Tarpley's ""9/11 Synthetic Terror"", Roger Stone's ""The Man Who Killed Kennedy"", Richard Dolan's ""UFOS and the National Security State, Terry Reed's ""Compromised"", Emanuel Josephson's ""Your Life is Their Toy"".

See you there!",1480291200,2,645,5.530612244897959

8649813,3,B00JD9M5IO,"Was good when I saw it in the 70s,  kind of cheesy now.  But it would make an awesome remake.",1478649600,,93,3.6
8649814,5,B00JD9M5IO,Very interesting movie.  Still very applicable to our political leaders today.,1476748800,,78,6.090909090909091
8649815,5,B00JD9M5IO,"This is amazingly Glen Ford's debut on television. It was critiqued as an above average TV movie. A young Robert Pine, later to be a regular on ""CHiPs,"" provides hope as Philip Everest Dunning to Glen Ford's Dr. Andrew Patterson. Nothing but the cream of the crop in familiar artists: Rosemary Forsyth, Dean Jagger, Maurice Evans, Will Geer (without the moustache he wore in ""The Waltons""), and a young Dabney Coleman (""9 To 5""). Eduard Franz a character actor from films 20-30 years previous is excellent as Dr. Konstantin Horvathy. What price does one have to pay for being enlisted into a secret society of white, Anglo-saxon, Protestants? Get ""Brotherhood of the Bell"" and find out! You'll love William Conrad as TV personality Bart Harris.",1462320000,3,744,4.96
8649816,5,B00JD9M5IO,"I'll bet this is VERY reflective of how behind-the-scenes power REALLY is being wielded by many at the top!  Scary!  And if so, complete and irrefutable public exposures of it need to be made, and the guilty need to be prosecuted and jailed in REAL prisons... not ""country-club"" imitations.  Doing HARD time!",1460160000,,308,4.884615384615385
