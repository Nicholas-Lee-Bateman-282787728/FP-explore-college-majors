8408441,1,B003XN69V0,I actually read the reviews for this before buying and have NO idea why I didn't listen to them. This is NOT a training video. This is a cheesy attempt for loser wrestlers to make a name for themselves by painting their faces different colors and acting out little skits. So lame. Good luck with you wrestling careers lameos.,1360972800,3,325,4.52542372881356
8408442,1,B003XN69V0,"Bottom line: I recommend P90X or Insanity instead. Tapout was poorly done, had an annoying trainer, and I think is just trying rake in $$ on the mma craze.

I got this since I have a martial arts background and really enjoyed the KenpoX part of P90X.

Sadly, Tapout is pale in comparison. First, the trainer/leader is ridiculously annoying. I must mute him to be able to do any of the work out. He's screechy, annoying, and he has poor technique. Second, the instructions and timer at the bottom of the screen is too hard to see. Third, the participants look like they are just doing it for the first time. There is no clear START since the timer goes the second the guy starts explaining the steps. Fourth, i was shocked to see such poor form from the MMA athletes they had in there. I would have thought they at least would have prepared for this. Five, the trainer guy is annoying. No seriously REALLY annoying....I must put this again. I hear his shrill voice in my head as I type.

Do not buy this is you want a martial arts workout. If you want that, try the shoutboxtimer.com for free.

So in short, save your money or better yet invest in P90x. The trainer there is far less annoying...and rather likeable in a goofy way.",1353196800,4,1229,4.400881057268722
8408443,2,B003XN69V0,"It was nice to see a tapout product, but the characters were not what threw me off i expected this to show me combat moves and hints not just watch some freaks in a bus just be bad asses.",1346716800,,187,3.8205128205128207
8408444,1,B003XN69V0,"This show was great when it was on, but i receive the dvd set today and was missing one of discs.",1341964800,3,97,3.6666666666666665
8408445,5,B003XN69V0,"This series is awesome. I remember catching episodes of it when it aired on Versus. This show follows the Founder of the successful Tapout clothing company, Mask, and his two partners, Punkass and Skyskrape. They travel on the Tapout bus to various gyms and training facilities across America searching for up and coming MMA fighters to sponsor their Tapout brand of clothing in the sport of MMA fighting.

If you are a fan of mixed martial arts and UFC, then you will enjoy seeing them hang out with guys like BJ Penn, Matt Hughes, or partying at Chuck Liddell's house. It gives you a great look inside the world of mma fighting. These guys are looking for underdog fighters to get behind and support to make them better. Each episode ends with the fighter they have chosen to sponsor actually getting in the ring or cage and having a fight. The fights are shown in their entirety, which is fun after you have spent 30 minutes getting to know these guys and want them to win their fight.

The most important element of this series and lasting legacy of the founder of Tapout clothing Charles Lewis Jr, aka Mask, was his unconditional support of the fighters he chose to sponsor, win or lose. Mask always cared about the psychological and physical well being of the guys he supported. If they needed something, he made sure they got it. If they were living on the streets, he got them an apartment, if they needed better training, he found them a good gym. If they were ready to go to the next level, he had connections to get them bigger fights.

Mask might have seemed like an odd character who wore grease paint on a daily basis, thus the nickname, Mask, but he was a very special man who grew up in hard times, watched a small t-shirt company he started in 1997 grow from $30,000 profit to well over $225 million annually before a tragic car accident ended his life way too soon in 2009. He was inducted into the UFC hall of fame at UFC 100, which is a testament to the impact he had on the sport of MMA fighting, the fighters, and the fans.",1289001600,20,2045,4.433510638297872
