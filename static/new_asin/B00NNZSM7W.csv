8679395,2,B00NNZSM7W,"Ava and Lala is a tough film to review.  I suppose a good part of this is because it originated in China and, naturally, was written and animated around a Chinese-speaking vocal cast.  As is so often the case when taking a foreign film, slapping an English dub voice-track over the top of it and calling it a day, many elements of the finished product come off as odd.

And odd is perhaps the best summary of the entire viewing experience that is Ava and Lala.  The story tells of a young girl names Ava being raised by her marital-arts instructor father (the whereabouts of her mother are never revealed).  In addition to being quite defiant, stubborn and at times rude, Ava is quite the martial artists herself.  In a physics-defying display reminiscent of Yoda in action at the end of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, early on the viewer is subjected to a scene where Avas dad tries to capture his naughty daughter to discipline her only to be foiled by the pint-size powerhouses arsenal of moves.

Finally prevailing, Ava is sent (tossed) to her bed and instructed to stay put.  She quickly escapes through an exit of her own design and, through a series of strange and disconnected events (from meeting a talking liger that is equal parts Pokemon and teddy bear only to be swallowed by a flying leviathan), finds herself in Cloud Land.

Cloud Land is a realm full of talking/ walking-upright animals and deep political/ mystical undertones.  We are painstakingly explained that Cloud Land was founded by animals as an escape from the one animal that cant get along with the rest (man) and that any human who spends more than three days time there becomes an animal as well.

While this sets Ava against a timer, the real conflict comes in the form of a tiger called General Tiger who decides to wage war against humanity even though Cloud Land seems pretty tranquil.  Further muddying up the waters are a prophecy predicting the arrival of an Anointed One.  Add to all of this sidekicks in the form of a giant bear called Uncle Bear (Tom Arnold), a wise rat straight out of the book of Master Shifu voiced by Star Trek alum George Takei, and of course Lala the liger and you have the perfect formula for quite a sloppy 80-minute mess.

Visually the film has a unique style with an understated color pallet and sequences wonderfully laced with Asian sensibilities including lush forests, clear-water lagoons and requisite raining lotus blossoms.  The characters emote fairly well with emphasis on the cuteness of the animal-characters in Cloud Land particularly.  After all, even the villainous dog characters are cute and cuddly as can only be accomplished in Asia.

Its apparent the English voice cast did what they could with the parts; especially Takei, who makes for an unexpectedly decent wise mentor type.  This is one of those cases, however, where all the acting talent in the world cant atone for a script that doesnt translate well for adults or children alike.

By the end of the piece kids will likely have more questions than answers because quite frankly, the plot is muddled up enough to where even adults will wonder exactly what the story is trying to relay.  Missed opportunities to turn this into a story with a good moral compass abound.  Since Ava already has a protective father in the real world, wouldnt it have made more sense to make the bear that cares for her in Cloud Land a matriarchal figure?  Since she is protrayed as quite a brat from the onset, shouldnt her time spend there have taught her the value in listening and respecting her elders?  In the final sequence, wouldnt a shot of her sleeping in the real world holding a stuffed animal that looked like Lala been perfect to lave the audience wondering if the whole thing wasn't a dream sort of like The Wizard of Oz?

Unfortunately these and dozens of other similarly pertinent questions go unanswered by the time the movie is over.  And as much as one wants to find fault in the original film for missing such obvious and logical storytelling beats, the fact that character mouth flaps often fail to line up with spoken dialog (and in some cases, the mouths of background characters move silently), serve as reminders that who can say how much was cut, changed and re-imagined in the translation?

All in all its pretty tough to recommend Ava and Lala to anyone.  Very small viewers, ones who will not be troubled by the muddled and nonsensical plot, may enjoy the visuals alone enough to be entertained.  Older kids and certainly adults who have become spoiled by the level of excellence found in years of watching pieces by Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony etc. will most certainly be disappointed here.

Im a subscriber to the theory that very rarely do CG animated movies that use this method of slapping an English dub atop a foreign film succeed on any level.  Arc Entertainments decision to try it again with Ava and Lava fails to make a compelling case against this theory.",1468540800,,4977,4.693901035673187

8679397,4,B00NNZSM7W,My 3 year old twin grand babies just cant get enough of this movie.  I've gotten it from the Library several times and they still haven't had enough.  Now I guess I'd better just buy it.  I like the story.  Its a little girl who causes a lot of trouble for herself and others because she just will not obey her father.  Great fun!,1443657600,,330,4.09375

8679402,5,B00NNZSM7W,"It's always a pleasure to be able to recommend a new DVD for the kids and ""Ava & Lala"" certainly fills the bill nicely! Another plus is that this is a film that older children and even adults should find it a joy to watch with the rest of the family.

Mira Sorvino has a lovely voice for this type of film and it was a hoot to hear Tom Arnold as the oversized bear and the voice of J.K. Simmons, after watching him in his other work (my favorite - ""The Closer""). Star Trek's George Takei makes a perfect sage Chief of the animals.

I would advise anyone to order a couple of extra DVDs to give as holiday gifts!",1416268800,,611,4.041322314049586
