898583,4,6304496869,"This is the best Kennedy movie I have ever seen. It is, as it says, the most powerful docudrama ever made. The actors in this DVD are very believable...I saw the Missiles of October on British Television when I was in the Air Force in 1974. Why did I buy it now? After seeing Kevin Costner's watered-down version of the Cuban missile crisis story in Thirteen Days...I knew I had to have this one.",1005868800,2,396,4.364864864864865
898584,5,6304496869,"I've been waiting for The Missiles of October to come out on DVD since I first got my DVD player over a year ago.  My VHS copy of Missiles, which is over 15 years old, has degraded greatly in picture and sound quality, so I was hoping that the DVD copy would be an improvement.  I was not disappointed.  It has an amazingly crisp picture and the sound is excellent.
When the movie Thirteen Days came out I was anxious to compare it to Missiles.  Thirteen Days was a good film, but I still prefer The Missiles of October.  All the performances are excellent, but William Devane, Martin Sheen and Howard DaSilva top the list.  I was barely six years old when the actual event occurred back in 1962 so I don't remember the incident from then.  However, I did see the movie when it originally aired in 1974 and was greatly impacted by it then.  They did an excellent job in weaving the actual documentary footage together with their dramatization.  Watching the thirteen day countdown to possible worldwide nuclear destruction is compelling watching.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a taste for history, suspense, excellent performances or as an example of how good television can be when given the chance.",999820800,31,1216,4.666666666666667
898585,5,6304496869,"I am very happy to report that the DVD version of The Missiles Of October is uncut.  When MPI released it on VHS in the 1980's, they cut a few minutes out of it...which made no sense unless they just didn't have tapes they could stretch out by five minutes longer.  Also, they have left intact all of the zoom-into-the-fence bumpers which meant a return from commercial. On the VHS version they edited some of them out...which made for some sloppy transitions.
This DVD is the way it should be:  uncut and untampered with.",995155200,2,522,4.531914893617022
898586,3,6304496869,"MISSILES OF OCTOBER feels too much like a stage play but, in an odd way, that feeling adds to the suspense of the film: you feel as trapped by circumstance and distance from ground zero (so to speak) as Kennedy and Khrushchev must have.
The performances here are outstanding.  I could never really believe Devane in any other part after this, and it took APOCALYPSE NOW to make Sheen something other than RFK in my mind.",992131200,7,420,4.526315789473684
898587,5,6304496869,"This film is proof that history, if just presented intelligently and dramatically, can be great entertainment!  Anyone who has the slightest interest in politics, war, current affairs...in short, any thinking person  who does not believe that TV viewing must begin and end with the likes of  ""Friends"" should see this film at least once in their lives.  The  acting is first rate, the script taught and well paced, and the drama is  real...not the fake drama you get from computer generated graphics.  Proof  that the interaction between real life people and nations can be much more  thrilling than with dinosaurs.  Again, this is a trully outstanding film -  one of those that you will always remember, and want to see again.  Favorite scene - Howard Da Silva (as Kruschev) trying to talk the rest of  the ruling Presidium out of attempting to further test President Kennedy's  nerve:  ""Are you prepared for war?"" he asks.  ""Are you  prepared for total destruction?  Give me an answer!  ""Please, see  this movie - you will not be disappointed!",951868800,8,1045,4.896551724137931

898680,3,6304496869,"If you like history, you'll probably enjoy this docudrama about the Cuban Missile Crisis.  It has a pretty impressive cast, with William DeVane as President Kennedy and Martin Sheen as his brother and attorney general, Robert Kennedy.  I mostly remember John Dehner as a comic actor or a villain, but in this movie he is very convincing as the venerable Dean Acheson.  However, whose bright idea was it to cast Ralph Bellamy as Adlai Stevenson?  Since when did Stevenson have that much hair?  There's a reason he was called ""Egghead""!

The film does a pretty good job recounting the tensions of the days when our country was literally teetering on the brink of war with Russia.  I've not read widely about the crisis, so I can't say too much pro or con about its historical accuracy.  However, it's a little on the dull side.  It has an awful lot of dialogue, which is fine in a stage play, but rather boring for television or film.  I recommend it only for history buffs.",1455408000,,972,4.598837209302325

The crisis was the closest that we ever came to all-out nuclear war.  Very thought-provoking discussions by the president, his brother and the president's advisors.  ""Missiles of October,"" in which Martin Sheen plays Bobby Kennedy, is very good - it's billed as a docudrama rather than a motion picture and is more what you might expect in the stage theater rather than the movie theater.  Khrushchev's letters to President Kennedy are a central part of both movies with Howard DaSilva reading them out loud as Khrushchev in ""Missiles of October.""

This war had to be avoided, because such a war would mean the End of the World. This film is a TV Docu-drama with fine actors and a script based on actual events.",1441411200,,489,4.384615384615385

898723,5,6304496869,"This was a made for TV film from the early 1970s.  It is superb if you want to get a feel of just how close we really came to exterminating ourselves in October of 1962.  The casting is excellent; William Devane as JFK and Martin Sheen as Bobby Kennedy were perfect in their performances, including passable Boston (Bass-ten) accents.  Howard deSilva as Khruschev was also a very good bit of casting.  You're inside both the White House and the Kremlin as both sides try to extricate themselves from the mess without losing face or triggering a nuclear war. At one point Khruschev bemoans the nine hour time difference between Washington and Moscow saying, ""The trouble is I'm working while he (Kennedy) sleeps, and he works while I sleep.  Maybe soon we all sleep."" The source material is the same used to make the film ""Thirteen Days"", but this is the better of the two movies.  This is a very tense, but enjoyable recounting of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and would be a good view for junior or senior high school students to understand and study what happened.",1436832000,2,1062,4.652406417112299

898725,5,6304496869,"All I can say is...AWESOME.

I first saw this TV docudrama when it aired on network TV in 1974. Love it then and love it now.

William Devane did an excellent job with his portrayal of JFK. Martin Sheen did an excellent job with his portrayal of RFK. All of the other actors delivered great performances.

The teleplay introduced William Devane as John F. Kennedy and cast Martin Sheen as United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The script is based on Robert Kennedy's book Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Staged as a two and a half hour television play, the production eschews physical action and detailed sets and wardrobes, in favor of emphasis on dialogue and emotions. It depicts how the world came close to the brink of, and eventually stepped away from global thermonuclear war, highlighting the roles of President John F Kennedy, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, Premier Nikita Khrushchev, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson, and former Secretary of State Dean Acheson in the crisis.

The Missiles of October gave the US general public its first look behind the scenes at the inner workings, disagreements, and ultimate consensus of Kennedy's administration to blockade Cuba, rather than attempt to invade to dislodge the just-discovered, only partially completed Soviet nuclear missile emplacements in Cuba. It details US attempts to give the Soviets room to negotiate without appearing to capitulate, and also periodically depicts Khrushchev reporting progress of the events to his Communist Party cohorts.

The play was directed by Anthony Page with writing credits given to Stanley R. Greenberg and Robert Kennedy.",1433116800,,1679,5.2

898795,5,6304496869,"There are plenty of reviews, so I want to focus on just one thing that makes this the stunningly film is truly is: Martin Sheen's portrayal of Bobby Kennedy. I've seen actors, lived with actors, been an actor; I was a playwright in the 70s when theater was booming in a way unimaginable now. But I've never seen an actor as good as Martin Sheen playing RFK.
The Kennedy's were a remarkably ruthless bunch of people, especially Jack and Bobby, calculating, cunning, capable of almost anything, from trying to assassinate Castro, to starting America's ugliest war by assassinating our ally, President Diem. Martin Sheen captures that ruthlessness perfectly. Cold-blooded Bobby...I will never forgive him for stabbing Gene McCarthy in the back in 1968, our one hope for peace, and paving the way for the worst Presidential race in history, Nixon vs. Humphrey vs. Wallace. Not to mention the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention.
This is a dynamite film. If you lived through those days, it will bring it back.
I was in high school during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and one morning the principal came on the loudspeaker during homeroom, and said, ""Well, there might be a nuclear war today...we don't know. Let's just pray we're alive to go home at the end of the day""! I don't think I've ever been quite so terrified in my life as I was at that moment.",1428105600,,1350,4.748936170212766

898832,5,6304496869,"Missiles of October chronicles the edge of madness of mankind.  Khrushchev had been telling American policy makers that they had provided only defensive weapons to the nation of Cuba all the while setting up short and medium range missiles with thermonuclear warheads.  in the vernacular of today, ""The s*** just got real"".

Missiles plays in docu-drama fashion, the tension of those horrible 13 days of October, 1962.  As a young grade school student with a father in the Navy, I was only too familiar with the problem.  I remember being taught to duck and cover under our school desks as if an aura from ""the desk"" would ward off nuclear fallout.  I remember my dad being quickly deployed with no explanation to the family.  Only afterwards did we learn why.

Missiles conveys the thickness of the air during JFK's cabinet meetings.  It grasps Ambassador Stevenson's sternness at the UN Security Council meeting.  Acting is all top-notch as those actors were certainly affected as private citizens during the era.

898931,5,6304496869,"This is a truly spectacular docudrama.  If you want to learn about the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the one film that you absolutely must watch.  Other movies have been made about those thirteen tense days in October of 1962 when the United States and the Soviet Union narrowly avoided a nuclear war -- most notably the Kevin Costner film ""Thirteen Days"" (2000), which is actually well worth watching -- but none has even come close to the brilliance of the 1974 teleplay ""The Missiles of October"" starring William Devane, Martin Sheen, Ralph Bellamy, and Howard DaSilva.  The production values on this film are fairly crude, largely because it was staged as if it were a play rather than a big-budget motion picture like ""Thirteen Days"".  But when dealing with real historical events -- and especially events of such grave magnitude as the ones depicted in this film -- it's far more important to get the human element right than to worry about sets, cinematography, and special effects.  ""The Missiles of October"" gets the human element right, and does so far better than any other movie ever made about these events, including ""Thirteen Days"".

William Devane and Martin Sheen give us an amazing portrayal of the Kennedy brothers.  Sheen, who is brilliant in everything he has ever been in, made an absolutely convincing Bobby Kennedy.  But it was Devane who really stole the show.  It seemed almost as if he were possessed by the ghost of Jack Kennedy, his performance was so perfect.  The main complaint I had with ""Thirteen Days"" was that I just didn't find the portrayal of Jack and Bobby Kennedy convincing enough; and this was just a bit too distracting.  This wasn't a problem with ""The Missiles of October"" -- while watching it, I could easily suspend my disbelief enough to convince myself that the people on the screen really were President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.  Howard DaSilva also gives a very convincing performance as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.  I was less pleased with some of the other characters, though.  Ralph Bellamy and Dana Eclar were just not really all that convincing as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, respectively.  (Here, ""Thirteen Days"" did a far better job of portraying these two characters.)  Nonetheless, overall, I think that ""The Missiles of October"" gives a more accurate portrayal of the key figures in the Cuban Missile Crisis than ""Thirteen Days"".

And the events portrayed in ""The Missiles of October"" are as historically accurate as was possible at the time this film was made.  (The depiction of what happened behind closed doors in the Kremlin was rather speculative, of course; and some new information about the Cuban Missile Crisis has come to light since then; but, in general, it's still perhaps the most historically accurate account of these events ever presented on film.)  The script was based largely on Robert F. Kennedy's book, ""Thirteen Days"", in which he described what went on behind closed doors at the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The movie ""Thirteen Days"" -- which, in spite of its title, was not based on Bobby Kennedy's memoir -- is a partially fictionalized account of what happened.  Though it includes some previously classified details that were not publicly available at the time ""The Missiles of October"" was made, it also includes some moments that never actually happened, but that were inserted into the film purely for dramatic effect.  So, on the whole, ""The Missiles of October"" is a more reliable retelling of the historical events than is ""Thirteen Days"".  In my view, both films are worth watching; but if you care more about historical accuracy and a believable portrayal of the key figures than about superficial cinematic appeal, then ""The Missiles of October"" is by far the better film.",1341187200,6,3888,4.975270479134466

The film came in 1974, long before a lot of information about this thirteen day standoff was declassified. For the era, it was a good  factual rundown of the crisis.

But the sets here are small, and the acting is a little dispassionate, and you always know you are watching a TV production. You don't get the notion that the world was on the brink of destruction.

As I recall, that series had an even-more-riveting feel to it regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis depicted in this movie. That said, this one is also well done and as another reviewer mentioned does play out like a stage play (that is often a good thing, and is here as well). The production values were quite high for a TV production of this era, though there is some distraction to this as sets are obviously re-dressed to serve as multiple locations - for example, the oval office is really quite square in this depiction; but like in a stage production this does put the focus on the actors where it belongs.

Overall, this is an historical drama which is well worth watching and I would recommend it.",1303689600,2,1041,5.386503067484663
898984,5,6304496869,"I was a Junior in college when the Cuban Missle Crisis erupted. Like so many ordinary people at the time, much of what was known was limited to what the media and the government made available. I clearly remember walking to class wondering if we were about to become part of a giant mushroom cloud. The tension was palpable and nearly unbearable.

Years later two films came out on DVD - the Kevin Costner production, and the film version of the stage production which is this film. I've watched both to fill in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of the time. In my humble opinion, The Missles of October is a far better portrayal of the actual events and the debates about courses of action.

William Devane was excellent in a flattering but very businesslike portrayal of John Kennedy, and the rest of the large cast was equally impressive. Because the film was made before the collapse of the Soviet Union, recent revelations regarding the Soviet side of the crisis were not included which would have made this docu-drama absolutely blockbuster great.

Let no one try to convince you that the events of October 1962 were anything less than a bone chilling crisis where nuclear annihilation was not only possible, but looked to be probable. This film captures the events to a remarkably good degree. I heartily recommend it not only as an excellent historical document, but a wakeup call for today regarding new nuclear threats emerging in today's world.",1301529600,5,1451,4.75

898988,4,6304496869,"I saw this when originally broadcast and back then video was considered (by me anyhow) a cheap way to do a dramatization. Not making it on film right in the middle of the made for TV movie and movie of the week phenomena seems strange but I think they were trying to recreate the ""live"" feeling of early TV (like 15 years earlier or ""The Golden Age?"") but it really is more like a soap. Lets make no mistake, I am grateful this is available and it is too bad that other video taped dramatizations are not available. Richard Chamberlain's ""Hamlet"" would be a wonderful release.

The technical problem is that the video master has a color problem. I think the video tape was exposed to some high power spurious magnetic source because I noticed the tint being greener at the bottom of the picture and more magenta at the top. This created an odd effect where skin tones were inconsistent. It was a bit of a distraction at first but, as I saw this on a Black and White TV in the first place, you can correct it by turning the color down if you want to. (I didn't!) It is not noticeable all the way through the video but I suggest buying it used if this would bother you but then again you will be missing an excellent drama.

You can forgive it all because the money was spent on the actors acting and the acting in this is a true treat. William Devane as JFK and a very young Martin Sheen as RFK (someone who I had only seen on the old Catholic TV Show ""Crossroads"") are worth the price of admission. The very young Michael ""Barton Fink"" Lerner as Salinger is another treat and the veteran character actor Howard De Silva, although not quite physically like Nikita Khrushchev, was also very believable. The very recognizable character Nehemiah Persoff as Gromyko, Kenneth Tobey as the Admiral in charge of the blockade, the authoritative Andrew Duggan as General Marshall, and a young Dana Eclair of later MacGyver fame as McNamara are but a few of the actors who fill out this cast. I even recognized B movie king Arthur Franz and it was nice to see Peter Donat who had a great part as the show producer in the film ""The Hindenburg"".

With all this talent this is a must have and a must see and I do recommend it but only four stars because of the technical flaw. There were so many stars/actors in this I have watched it twice since I got it for XMAS! A great if flawed value.

Good watching!",1261958400,3,2392,4.356502242152466
899038,5,6304496869,"'The Missiles of October' is a very well made drama of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It does not have the flash of the more recent 'Thirteen Days' but it is very gripping in its own right. The movie is filmed almost as a play and I liked this aspect of it.

I really enjoyed William Devane's JFK. He really does a good job of playing this now larger than life character to a understandable level. The decisions that were made by Kennedy were truly momentous and Devane brings out the torture of every political move that JFK had to make. Martin Sheen is also good in his portrayal of RFK. Howard Da Silva deserves mention in his depiction of Nikita Khrushchev. The tightrope that Khrushchev was also walking is dramatized. 'Missiles of October' shows more of the Soviet side than was depicted in 'Thirteen Days'.

The DVD is sadly bare bones. The picture quality is decent and the sound adequate.

For any student of JFK, the Cold War, or the American Presidency this movie comes highly recommended!

PS: Kenny O'Donnell ,personal assistant to the president, wrote a very good memoir on working with JFK that I recommend called 'Johnny- We Hardly Knew Ye'. There are many interesting anecdotes about JFK and his political career. O'Donnell is a bit character in 'Missiles of October' but is played by Kevin Costner in 'Thirteen Days' and the story is told mainly through his eyes.",1252195200,3,1376,4.6970954356846475

The problem is that by being focused on the actors, it's impossible to miss the sync issues that make this DVD almost unwatchable. Voices lag mouths by a fraction of a second, which becomes really distracting when there are close-ups -- and there are plenty in this movie -- of an actor's face.

According to the Internet Movie Database, The Missiles of October ""was originally shot on videotape, and first shown in this format, but when it was sold to local stations, it was transferred to film."" Perhaps that transfer has something to do with the sync problems. Whatever the reason, it's unforgivable that this problem wasn't fixed before the DVD was issued.

899046,5,6304496869,"1974's ""The Missiles of October"" is a powerfully acted and still compelling TV docudrama of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, as the United States and Soviet Union came perilously clsoe to war over the placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba.

The presentation is stark but engrossing, in the manner of the film version of ""Twelve Angry Men.""  An excellent cast of TV character actors inhabit a series of austere sets meant to replicate the White House, the Presidium of the Soviet Union, and a handful of other venues where crucial decisions were debated.  The austere sets increase the tight focus on the principals as they struggle with the crisis and with their emotions.  William Devane and a young Martin Sheen are outstanding as President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, at the center of an agonizing decision-making process.  Howard de Silva plays a cantankerous and cunning Soviet Chairman Khrushchev, who discovers he may be riding a tiger he cannot dismount in the crisis.

The story is presented in a even-handed manner that reinforces the difficulties for both the Americans and the Soviets, including the supreme challenge for each of correctly decerning the intentions of the other.  The intercutting of actual film footage showing military preparations adds to the building suspense.  The dialogue is drawn or extrapolated from the historical record.

This film works both as a drama and as an exploration of an historical event still studied as a model of crisis decision-making.  ""The Missiles of October"" is very highly recommended to those who remember the event and those who wish to study it.",1221177600,4,1620,5.056390977443609

899099,5,6304496869,"THE MISSILES OF OCTOBER is a tense, tight, made for TV, docudrama about the Cuban missile crisis. It is a Golden Laurel award-winning film based on all historical evidence about those 13 days in October, 1962. Many of us have forgotten or never knew the crisis 45 years ago that brought us to the edge of nuclear war and possible extinction of life as we know it. Unbeknown to America and with full denial from Russia, the USSR had begun to build a nuclear missile arsenal in Cuba that was capable of destroying all of America and most of South America and it was 90 miles from our shores. When a U-2 spy plane discovered the project from 14 miles above the earth, it precipitated perhaps one of the greatest confrontations in world history. The two superpowers, the two nations capable of annihilating one another were face to face. Not that these weapons weren't already the greatest concern of the world already, but why was Russia putting these clearly 'offensive weapons' only 90 miles from the U.S. What were they up to? JFK and his administration had 10 days to figure it out and react before the missiles would be fully installed. The film is about those 13 days in October when the U.S. and Russia played the ultimate nuclear chess game. The film is mostly about the American side but also shows a very interesting side of the Russians during this time as it bounces back and forth between the two leaders. The tension was unimaginable as this was no theoretical discussion about war, this was nuclear war on our doorstep. It makes the discussion of WMD's in Iraq look like a elementary discussion. In reality, this might be a great film for all our leaders to watch before going to war. Kennedy had to face Kruschev as well as his own military machine, who wanted to take out the nuclear weapons with military force. Kennedy, for all his personal flaws, really seemed to grasp the dangers of war and what responding militarily could do to the world. He chose, instead, to use our military might as the bargaining chip for peace. Kruschev, also, had to battle his 'comrades' who were eager to take on the U.S. and he showed great courage in standing up to them and negotiating with the U.S. This is a well done film about a historical moment in our history that could have changed the course of world history overnight. As one reviewer said, this proves that history does not have to be boring. Should be required viewing for everyone under 50 as a reminder that we can deal with the most difficult of all situations and not have to go to war, even though it could have ended up with two nations destroying each other.

""The Missiles of October"" is a 1974 or '74 ABC-TV/Viacom television movie running at 155 minutes, probably a miniseries, shot on videotape in NTSC.  The DVD version is an NTSC version.  The picture quality of the DVD is extremely good considering the age and means of the production.

HERE'S MY AMAZON DISCLAIMER: Regarding other reviews here, it's hard to argue against any statement that this movie ""idolizes JFK,"" because it's based on RFK's book about their actions regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Therefore, in assuming his perspective, saying the film is idolizing JFK is unethical, as we should be lucky that he wrote the book in the first place.  I mean, calling it ""idolizing"" basically throws away the fact of its biographical existence of a specific moment of history.  Everything is first-hand information with his own person, JFK, being the central character.  Therefore, it's going to take his side, as who else's would it assume?  This is not idolization, but dramatic biography!  Docu-drama.  Does one who accuses this movie of idolization also accuse it of depicting events that did not happen as according to its author?  If not, then I submit the criticism of idolization has nothing to do with anything.  I mean, one could call it biased, and be right, as it would have to be, since it is FFK's story and not someone else's!  I'm not sure what ""idolizing"" means.  But, onto my review:

I'm not sure about some of the information about what written material this movie was based on, but immediate informal research concludes that this movie was based partly on Robert F. Kennedy's book ""Thirteen Days"" about the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If you remember this name somehow, it's probably due to the book's remake into a movie in 2000 (premiered in 1999) with the same title by director Roger Donaldson, with Kevin Costner in a co-starring role.

The name is a reference to a book entitled ""The Guns of August,""  a book about the Great War (a.k.a. WWI) addressing problems of the combination of the ""real politik"" paradigm, the German words for realism--a study of politics from the linking of the world through self-interest and armed conflict--with the virtue of the paradigm of idealism.  Since the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred in October, the movie's name, ""The Missiles of October,"" is a comment on the former to denote the potential seriousness of the incidents in this crisis which were mainly in the drama of JFK's decisions to avert nuclear war against the communistic U.S.S.R.

The movie has an exceptional cast, and a large one, with actors with long and noticeable careers in cinema long before 1973, even in the days of black-and-white.  Otherwise, Soviet Premier Khrushchev is played by Howard DaSilva, who had memorably co-starred in the film version of the stage musical ""1776"" playing Ben Franklin, the delegate and inventor; in Joseph Losey's film ""M""; and, in ""The Great Gatsby"" with Robert Redford.  Also, John Kennedy's brother Robert is played by Martin Sheen, and he had went on to star in ""Apocalypse Now"" and several other films.

The thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis has since become a subject of study, and this film should be recommended to anyone studying this moment of history, because it is a very literary translation, playing out with the drama being solely located in the scripts themselves: both the screenplay script and the actual international relations scripts from which this movie seems to borrow so much.

In comparison between this 1974 television movie to the 2000 film version, the t.v. movie is very talky, but still manages quite well to pull off the drama which is mostly in the script.  The film version has the same dramatic themes obviously, but they are much more well-funded with expensive shots of military crafts both air and sea, an even larger cast, and never-before-seen footage of real nuclear explosions, this time in beautifully full color film rather than the black-and-white stock for the videotaped t.v. movie.  The theatrical film version lacks the character of the Soviet Premier, and so it seems much less ""talky"" than the t.v. version.  The t.v. version had already made JFK as the central figure only to tell the story in dramatic sequence rather than in defense of him since it is based on JFK's book, so his characterization is like a lion, as this method is the best way to tell the story that is virtually his anyway.  If it had not done this with his perspective, it would've decreased the suspense.  The television movie deserves a lot of credit for being able to maintain that suspense through the excellent cast and script, much of which is taken from historic speeches.  Ultimately, the t.v. movie is about how JFK had de-pressurized the system, where the film version does this much more in such a way as to imprint an image of JFK in memory.

In result of the historical events as they are portrayed in the t.v. movie, the JFK character mentions his own lack of air support in the Bay of Pigs invasion.  It connects the Soviet Premier's placement of missiles in Cuba as a partial belief of the impotence of a U.S. president that is younger than his first son.  Nevertheless, with JFK responding by cutting off Cuba from the Soviets, the Americans and the Soviets begin towing the line, in addition to the nuclear threat, as JFK is not only aware of the nuclear missiles the Soviets have placed in Cuba, but is threatening to attack on the moment those missiles become operational.  Finally, after military maneuvers and the sole casualty of an American spy plane, the two leaders finally defuse the situation on agreement, in-turn avoiding nuclear war.",1190851200,3,5705,4.901144640998959

899106,5,6304496869,"In the autumn of 1962, the Soviet Union began placing medium and intermediate range nuclear missile sites in Cuba.  These missiles were a direct threat to the entire United States, Mexico, Latin America, and portions of Canada.  During those thirteen days, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  This excellent movie depicts what life was like in the Kennedy White House during those long, trying days.

William Devane stars as President John F. Kennedy.  He is told that intelligence reports have shown that the Soviets are building nuclear missile sites in Cuba.  Upon confirmation of the reports, the President, along with his cabinet members, begin to formulate a plan as to how to deal with the threat.  Bobby Kennedy (Martin Sheen) is in favor of a naval blockade, while members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff prefer bombing the sites.  President Kennedy is determined to not let the Soviets know that the U.S. has found out about the missiles.  As each day passes, the missiles get closer and closer to being operational.  The tension continues to rise throughout the crisis, and the strain is evident on President Kennedy's face.

Meanwhile, Premier Nikita Khrushchev (Howard Da Silva) has proclaimed that the missiles were placed in Cuba as protection for Castro's regime after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion attempt.  He claims they are for defense only.

The two sides continue to free-fall toward nuclear war.  Kennedy insists that the missiles must be removed.  The Soviets want the United States to remove their missiles from Turkey before they pull out from Cuba.  A naval blockade of the island is set up, with the Americans given orders to stop and turn back any Soviet vessel trying to get past the blockade.  The Soviets threaten to sink the American vessels so their ships may pass.  Unfortunately, the blockade doesn't work as planned, and soon, the missile bases were operational.  Now, Kennedy had another choice to make; should he bomb the sites?  During this time, an American U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Cuban missiles.  The two superpowers moved ever closer to war.  But, an 11th hour breakthrough between the two countries saved the world from nuclear war.  The Soviets agreed to remove all of their missiles from Cuba if the United States pledged to not invade Cuba.  This agreement saved the world from nuclear armageddon.

This is an excellent movie.  William Devane does a first-rate job as President Kennedy.  He even managed to copy Kennedy's thick Boston accent.  Martin Sheen is equally good as JFK's loyal brother.  Perhaps one of the best performances is delivered by Ralph Bellamy as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson.  The scenes where he's sparring with the Soviet ambassador, telling him he's prepared to wait until hell freezes over for a response is one of the best parts of the film.

Although I was not alive during this crisis, I've read much about it, and I commend President Kennedy for his unwavering insistence that the missiles be removed from Cuba, and this movie does his memory justice in that aspect.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The historical accuracy is excellent, and the acting is impeccable.  For thirteen days in the autumn of 1962, the security of the world hinged on two people.  Thank goodness, they came to an agreement.",1174435200,4,3348,4.928443649373882

The competeing version 'Thirteen Days' was made about 30 years later when we really knew much more about the family as real people and not characters in a fantasy. Both tell the story but the fanatsy view of the Kennedy presidency does overshadow the story considerably. There is none of the medical and physical problems the plagued Jack's running of the country nor any reference at all to his constant sexual escapades that no doubt interferred with his presidency. We know what President Clinton did, but we have little knowledge of Jack's constant chasing of women bed partners that must have had to be interspersed with his trying to run the country, a job he did rather badly as we now know.

Both these versions tell the story of the Cuban missle crisis, But I often wonder how much the Kennedys really had to do with solving the problem. I do suspect, given what we know about both Jack and Bobby now, whether they had the smarts to pull this off or did they just luck out and have a really good group of advisors that have never gotten the honors they deserved.

I would not now purchase the earlier version but put my money down for the second. It tells a better story putting both Kennedys a bit more in the background.",1158105600,5,1386,4.562248995983936

899141,5,6304496869,"In the fall of 1974 I gathered with others at a friends house with the intention of going out for the evening. By chance, a commercial announced that ""The Missiles of October"", one of television's first attempts at a docu-drama (the other being The Andersonville Trial) was about to come on. We decided to wait 'a few minutes' to see some of it. Three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on. Silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of ""you are there"" that kept us riveted to the story. Looking back now I realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average American, namely, what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of October of 1962, when the world was on the edge of nuclear Armageddon. This work is very intellectual, superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes. It is important to remember that this was shown during an era of STRONG anti-military feeling. The country was winding down from Vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in '62 from when we were only children reminded us of what America CAN accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict. There is a LOT of good acting. The scenes are cleverly done, shifting between Washington and Moscow with tid-bits of B&W 'events in the world' film thrown in. We get to see ""inside"" the exec committees of both the White House and Kremlin and how they plot strategy. Attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably. ""Pueblo"" in 1976 did not capture the tension and mystique and television has simply never been able to repeat what I now believe was a dramatic miracle of production on screen.

Well, as a former Air Force Command and Control Specialist with Top Secret security clearance, I can tell you that America is always in a state of war, whether it be overt i.e. Iraq, or covert i.e. the cold war we are in with China.

American men and women working for agencies like the National Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security, and the infamous Central Intelligence Agency, are in a constant battle against espionage, theft of Top Secret information, the theft of weapons and weapon systems, and the threat of germ warfare. Most Americans didn't know numerous Russian submarines were just off our shores, awaiting orders to launch their missiles.

The Missiles of October is a dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis and delivers a gripping peek into the inner workings of Whitehouse policy when world events, which are shaky at best, take us to the brink of colossal destruction.

899146,5,6304496869,"With the publication of ""The Kennedy Tapes"" (May and Zelikow 1997) and, more recently, ""Averting the Final Failure"" (Sheldon Stern 2004), we now know what exactly was said by whom and when in the White House during these heady 13 days known universally as ""The Cuban Missile Crisis"". What has never really been conveyed (in print or otherwise) is the true ""feeling"" of what these leaders went through...I'd submit that that the true value of this video is the portrayal of the immediacy and emotion invoked by all participants during the Crisis. This film may lack some historical accuracy, but it more than makes up for it as an emotional target for this period and remains, to this day, an important and believable reference for this seminal period of the Cold War.
William Devane, Martin Sheen and William DaSalva portray a version of the Crisis that is at once believable and accurate as far as the emotional element is concerned, and convey an amazingly accurate ""emotional history"". This, coupled with the known version of the Crisis in 1974, gives a view of the Kennedy White House inner-workings that has remained somewhat the ""standard"" for understanding the strategy of the ""Best and Brightest"" who made up the Kennedy Cabinet. Character development is based on RFK's version of the Crisis in his post-humous work ""Thirteen Days"", and we know now that this was somewhat contrived...only to the extent that some things were said or believed that were overly amplified for emphasis. The true feeling of these exalted gentlemen has never been questioned and I think that the prospective viewer will be impressed with the detail and emotional content of this work.
So enjoy this movie and take from it the exacting and crucial motivations of a Government under siege and you'll be impressed (as I've continued to be for these 30 years) that ""The Missiles of October"" portrays the Kennedy government accurately as it struggled through the tortuous 13 days of the Crisis and leaves as it's legacy the true emotions of those heady days.

899147,5,6304496869,"There is very little to criticize about this dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The film mainly focuses on the deliberations on the American side, i.e. President John F. Kennedy and his Ex-Comm group (""Executive Committee of the National Security Council"") as they try to force the Soviets to remove the missiles from Cuba while avoiding a nuclear conflict.  The film successfully conveys the fears and difficulties faced by JFK and his team, their thoughts and deliberations.  The script is fairly close to the actual facts as they are understood today.  This is a wonderfully educational production that any parent would do well to watch with his or her children.
Devane is pretty good as JFK.  I thought that Martin Sheen absolutely nailed Bobby Kennedy.  The supporting actors were uniformly excellent.  Good casting throughout.
One of the excellent things about the production is the occasional interjection of period news bulletins of nuclear tests, the escalating conflict, etc.  These added a wonderful sense of authenticity even as they entertained.
A few quibbles, all minor.  I thought that the movie somewhat (not excessively) idolized the Kennedys.  It was a bit much when one member of Ex Comm commented that ""Bobby [Kennedy] I confess your moral arguments [against invading Cuba] never occurred to me...""  Come on, of course they did.  The record shows that Ex Comm debated these issues extensively. Nor was Bobby Kennedy against invading Cuba--the record is pretty clear that both Kennedys had been pushing for removing Castro by various means before the crisis began.  Bobby Kennedy's comment that bombing the missiles out of Cuba would be like a ""reverse Pearl Harbor"" was disdained as amateurish by most of Ex Comm.  The movie barely acknowledges that. [Dean Acheson characterizes that analogy to JFK at one point as ""false and pejorative...""].  The movie portrays the US Navy as lusting after conflict in a manner I thought was unseemly--this was my only major criticism of the film.  [""Thirteen Days"" shares this flaw.]  Hollywood often cannot pass up a chance to take a swipe at the military.
This is an incredibly worthwhile production that I make a point of watching every year or so.  A must for the thoughtful viewer's DVD collection.",1054166400,47,2269,5.119565217391305

This is a dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. The attempted invasion of Cuba in 1961 at the Bay of Pigs was a failure. This led to the decision to place Soviet rockets in Cuba to protect the Castro regime. When the American government discovered this by the use of high-flying U-2 airplanes or satellites, their immediate concern was to stop these missiles. There were two choices: an attack to bomb and destroy the missile bases, or, to blockade the Soviet ships that brought these armaments. The first would require a sneak attack on a small country and then an invasion; this would offend world opinion and be different from past American policy. It could also result in a military escalation elsewhere in the world, possibly a nuclear World War. How can this crisis be solved?

This story presents the history of this event that was unknown to the American people at the time. Those who were adults at that time remembered the fear that kept some people home that day. They expected WW III and wanted to be with their families. Fortunately, Kennedy and Khrushchev found a compromise solution that let them stand down and resolve the crisis. But some criticized the actions afterwards. Kennedy was removed as President a year later; some say it was a long gunman. Khrushchev was removed as Premier in 1964. There was a new crisis in Vietnam that wasted lives and money for over a decade. Conflicts continue, even if shooting wars are episodic. The current threat is from terrorists, where one or more men can threaten many people. Were JFKs actions reckless in supporting the Bay of Pigs invasion? He followed the advice of military experts. This was foolish, even if others would have done the same. One effect was to arrange a teletype machine for direct contact between Washington and Moscow.

Back in the early days of TV there was a popular program called You Are There that dramatized historical events as entertainment or education.
