6452520,2,B00KWFHD5S,"I like to watch documentaries on ancient and medieval warfare because it allows me to see heroic men before mechanized warfare. It's also a great escape from current events and the modern era. The last thing I want to see is a man dressed up as a woman giving commentary on the battle. I couldn't get passed that. I know that we are supposed to pretend that we don't care so we can feel intellectually superior, but I would rather tell how I really feel. Besides that unfortunate, the documentary was bizarre in other ways. The actors were strange and corny as hell. The whole thing was a spook show.",1507939200,4,600,4.463636363636364
6452521,1,B00KWFHD5S,"With regret, this is a travesty.  The reviewers are of low intellectual estate as this video demonstrates.",1507852800,2,106,5.235294117647059
6452522,4,B00KWFHD5S,"In reading the various reviews for this film, I gather that most of the lower-rated ones based their assessment on the graphics and ""artistic"" side of this film.  Arguably they are a bit cheesy and overdone, but they do not detract one iota from the writing, which depicts the story wonderfully well.  This film presents a clear, concise and easily-followed narrative of the events leading up to this event, and its resolution.  I was actually on the edge of my seat for a bit, wondering if Edward's army would make it to Stirling before the truce ended.

The questionable graphics are easily put aside if you just want to know about the battle of Bannockburn.  This film explains it clearly.  If you are a light scholar about Scottish history, then this film will explain a momentous event in its history in very understandable terms.",1507507200,3,835,4.763888888888889
6452523,4,B00KWFHD5S,Good information. Worth watching.,1507507200,,33,7.5
6452524,3,B00KWFHD5S,I have only one thing to say. Flodden 1513.,1506211200,,43,3.888888888888889
6452525,3,B00KWFHD5S,"The information is not bad, pretty much sticks to history. Presentation is mixed documentary narration and acted out scenes. I have watched documentaries here this works, this one seems to just not pull it off.",1506211200,,210,5.0285714285714285
6452526,1,B00KWFHD5S,"What Is This Move? I was somewhat confused by this film. Is it a documentary? Is it a videogame? Is it an advertisement for transgender equality? Is it a cinematic obsession with the color red? The movie is narrated by a homely redheaded woman who in fact is a man. This verbose redhead describes the bloodsoaked battlefields of Scotland in considerable detail. Considerable detail! Considerable detail! The background scenery in the movie appears to be computer generate and of videogame quality. Although there is no fighting going on, periodically the entire TV screen would be smeared with blood. There was no explanation for the appearance of this blood in the film. The director of this film should be shot. He took a serious drama based on the rich and noble history of Scotland and turned it into a freak show comedy.",1506124800,5,825,4.858156028368795
6452527,4,B00KWFHD5S,I will forgive the somewhat clunky effects. Very good storytelling.,1505952000,2,67,5.8
6452528,2,B00KWFHD5S,"I find the subject interesting, this documentary is not.  The film makers here are more interested in themselves than the subject.  Over-saturated colors, the longest long edits approach a length of 2 seconds and video game blood graphics  slung across the screen at a rapid rate, even when there is no violence occurring .make for a program that moves at one frantic pace and that gets boring rather quickly.  Suspenseful drumbeats, suspenseful orchestra ad nauseam.",1493596800,,467,5.1866666666666665
6452529,4,B00KWFHD5S,"For a historical documentary, it is very entertaining, and one that I will again and again.",1469664000,,91,4.75
8662177,4,B00KWFHD5S,A fine telling of the story. My only complaint is the same footage was shown numerous. One would think the production crew could have come up with more scenes.,1530144000,,159,4.517241379310345
8662178,4,B00KWFHD5S,"What kind of person comes here to vent their phobias about transvestites?  This is a documentary made with use of computer graphics... if you're expecting actual footage or high-budget documentaries such as ""Braveheart"" then, sure, this won't blow yer kilt up",1528329600,,259,5.317073170731708
8662179,2,B00KWFHD5S,"Tries hard to emulate ""300"" in it's graphics, could have done without the Mrs. Doubtfire cameo.",1524096000,,95,5.0
8662180,3,B00KWFHD5S,I couldn't get past the tranny.,1523059200,,31,4.333333333333333
8662181,4,B00KWFHD5S,Fairly well done depiction of the great battle between the Scots and the English in 1314.  A worthwhile watch.,1516320000,,110,4.7894736842105265
8662182,4,B00KWFHD5S,"Follows the basic knowledge of what is known. Well presented. I'm not sure what all the negative nellies are about here. Bad compared to what?! Were they there? Maybe they are expecting the ""Vikings"" (very entertaining) or something else.",1514764800,,238,5.128205128205129
8662183,1,B00KWFHD5S,One of the worst documentaries I have ever watched...and I like documentaries.  A bit confusing in its delivery because of all the bad green screen acting with what appears to be buckets of Photoshopped or After Effects blood.  I suggest passing on this stinker.,1513382400,,262,4.931818181818182
8662184,5,B00KWFHD5S,Excellent docudrama.,1509235200,,20,9.5
8662185,4,B00KWFHD5S,"Splendid recap of the circumstances leading up to Bannockburn, as well as the battle itself. A combination of narrative style documentary with theatrical scenes enacted.",1509062400,,169,5.8
8662186,1,B00KWFHD5S,"This docu-drama would have been only mediocre were it not for the juxtaposition of heroic masculinity with the transvestite commentator's inane interjections in school marmish falseto.  It was thus elevated to a theatre of the absurdity of our own times--horseflesh, horseflesh, horseflesh, horseflesh!",1508716800,3,302,6.023255813953488
