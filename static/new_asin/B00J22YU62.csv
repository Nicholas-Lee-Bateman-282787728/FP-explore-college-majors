6308869,1,B00J22YU62,"Years ago, someone described Waiting for Godot as a play where nothing happens - twice. This is a film where nothing happens three or four times.

I saw this bomb at the Toronto International Film Festival. After it was screened, the line-ups to other pictures were full of mystified people who had enjoyed Sexy Beast and were trying to figure out what in hell Glazer thought he was doing.

After a couple of minutes of good CGI, the film follows a seemingly lobotomized Scarlett Johansson through a dreary Scottish landscape as she drives around looking for isolated men to pick up. She lures them to various locations that look like deserted warehouses. Each man undresses and walks eagerly toward the naked Scarlett Johansson. Before reaching her, they vanish into what looks like a pool of crude petroleum. The same thing happens over and over. No script except for a few stereotyped come-on lines.

That's what happens in 80% of this movie. No kidding. Aside from the petroleum scenes, you get random shots of this dude inexplicably cruising by Scarlett's van on a motorcycle. Is he Alien Command Central? Who knows? Who cares?

Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, there's a hamfisted attempt to make sense out of this mess. It doesn't succeed.

No doubt you are thinking at this moment that I must be exaggerating. I wish I was.

This film has attracted many positive reviews, some of which you can read here.  Most of them seem to be saying:  I can't make head or tail of this, so it must be really profound.  I would suggest to such reviewers that they ought not to blame themselves if they don't see the point of this movie.  Blame Glazer instead.  And remember the Hans Christian Andersen story about The Emperor's New Clothes.

The reality is that there's nothing here to like:  no plot, no character development, no dramatic tension. It's a skull-numbing bore.

Apparently, Glazer spent years on Under the Skin. That may explain why it is such a complete failure. Thinking, rethinking, thinking again. Editing, re-editing, editing again. And after a while, it's not clear what the movie is there for. Not clear to the audience - or the director.

Okay, some may think it's worth wasting two hours of their lives to see Scarlett Johansson in the nude. If that's your only reason for going, go by all means. Otherwise, give this film a pass.",1397088000,22,2356,4.740196078431373
6308870,4,B00J22YU62,"This is a movie where you need to keep an open mind, don't judge it until the end.  It's not as dramatic as the Body Snatchers.  But the ending of this movie ties everything together which make the movie worth watching.",1531008000,,219,4.317073170731708
6308871,1,B00J22YU62,Not sure why this movie was even made. Dialogue is pretty much nonexistent and not sure who the motorcycle riders are or what their purpose is in this movie. Waste of money.,1530921600,,173,4.4375

6308873,3,B00J22YU62,"Under the Skin is a slow burn that may not pay off for many viewers. Jonathan Glazer directs Under the Skin with a beautiful look and cinematography, but this movie is all aesthetics and ideas less so substance. All the lovely panning shots and unsettling sequences of genuine horror and science fiction intrigue leave you feeling empty with the hollow emotions of Under the Skin.

The main issue is the pacing. Under the Skin is only 108 minutes, but it feels twice the length. Every shot goes on too long, every scene feeling unfinished, every sentiment coming across as shallow. I get the idea of an alien that kills single men by luring them into darkness seems interesting, but her learning how to love is considerably less so. I think audiences everywhere with be bored to tears at the not surprising reveals and twists that Under the Skin has to offer. This is an neat sci-fi film, but a poor movie going experience.

Positively, Scarlett Johansson gives one of her most chilling performances yet. Her natural emotionless demeanor actually helps her transform into this seductive alien presence. Johansson gives her best acting in Lost in Translation and Under the Skin. This movie is worth seeing once just for Scarlett's cool portrayal and stunning beauty. I liked her in Under the Skin.

Overall, I feel like Under the Skin makes for a cool modern sci-fi movie, but it fails in engaging the audience. It is well made, but edited far too slowly for how little actually happens. If you like Under the Skin, I recommend seeing Arrival, Annihilation, or Oblivion. If you do not like snail paced science fiction, skip Under the Skin.",1530748800,,1638,4.801418439716312

6308882,5,B00J22YU62,"This is a slow, cyclical movie about something mechanical realizing that it's aware, and beginning to questions what it's doing and what will happen to it. Expect to see variations of the same movements several times, and expect to watch an interaction with something that is distinctively alien (and I mean, not anthropomorphized in any way) without ever getting a full explanation of what it is. There is virtually no action in this film. There are a lot of eerie, beautifully framed shots, and some really unnerving (almost nightmare like) moments. There is very little dialogue and no explicit resolution, but the film tells a fairly coherent story (without revealing the motivations of an unknowable alien force that is driving it).

I'd also note, if you look at the review breakdown -- this film has a disproportionate number of one star reviews, which basically consist of one sentence ""I was bored; this was stupid"". If you're expecting a Scarlett Johansson action movie, you have come to the wrong place. Don't give a negative review to a toaster because it couldn't wash your dishes.",1529971200,,1094,4.978142076502732

6308885,5,B00J22YU62,"This is a film that truly lives up to its title. It is absolutely dripping with a depressive atmosphere, and the feeling of dread can be overwhelming. Johansson delivers here as an emotionless alien who has the ability, along with others of her kind, to inhabit the actual SKIN of their victims. I also give Scarlett credit for agreeing to do a film with this level of despair inherit in the script. Just watch the scene on the beach with the crying child to get a sense of what I am talking about. The low score here is actually SHOCKING! This definitely deserves a better overall score, and I would imagine there is something that is driving it.",1528416000,,647,4.491525423728813

A minor masterpiece by Scarlett Johansson. I am sure it is not for all tastes, though. By all means watch the film, if only for the acting and atmosphere.

Generally, I don't write my opinions on the plotlines or basic story of films but I  just HAVE to prevent anybody else from watching this literal sleeper.  I just DID NOT get it.  WAY too slow, the story was running on empty and it had ONE (1) saving grace; Johansson.  I love her in every single film that I've EVER watched... except this one.  Without spoiling the ""plot"" (HaHa!) I'll just say that even Johansson's acting lacked the sliver of the acting that she puts into everything else that I've ever seen from her.

There is simply no plot- Males ensnared by Scarlet simply vanish into a black pool of ooze, with  no explanation what has happened to them.
 I suppose if you were a male hater, perhaps you would enjoy such an abstract type of film as this.

I think many people went into it expecting the typical popcorn movie and ended up outside their comfort zone.  It is not without its flaws, but overall interesting, creepy, and beautifully shot.  It sets up a lot of questions that are never answered.  Like many great works of horror, it leaves the story to the audience to fill in the blanks.  I had to turn subtitles on to understand the accents, but really the dialogue is not important.
Here's my helpful guide to decide if you should watch this movie:
Have you ever watched a David Lynch movie and enjoyed it?
Yes?  Watch this movie.
If you have no idea who David Lynch is without googling... don't watch this movie. :)",1516060800,,750,4.477941176470588

The scenes in which the alien seduces men back to her home and then consumes them in the ""tar"" are visually unsettling, as the men continue to approach her, as if they don't notice that they are sinking.

6308948,1,B00J22YU62,"I read the book quite a few years ago and saw the movie just tonight. I was quite disappointed that the only thing Glazer took from Fabers phenomenal novel was the concept of an alien in human form highjacking humans. There were so many rich and original concepts in the novel that would have made for a visually and mentally stimulating movie. I was so looking forward to seeing the hypodermic needles plunge out of the cars passenger seat and into the passenger! I was looking forward to seeing the vodsels in their cells all fattened up and hairless and ready to be slaughtered. I was hoping to get a glimpse of Isserley going through one of her many bone-breaking surgeries. Instead the filmmaker gave us a slow-paced, serene, dreamlike slice of randomness.

That's about it ....just a series of 'pick-ups', peculiar ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours"" seductions and then slowly sinking into 'goo' ... when the poor dear finally discovers that it has a vagina ... all of us are as confused as she is .....

THIS specific 'alien' has absolutely NOT done any population ....

Perhaps a counterpoint to ""The Arrival""?

6308998,5,B00J22YU62,"The title of this review bears repeating: The first clue to understanding this film is its title: ""Under the Skin"" and that's figurative as well as literal. Note: if the Scottish brogue is difficult to understand in places, turn on the English subtitles. Then again, fully understanding everything said isn't required, it's carefully observing what you're seeing that's essential.

This UK (more specifically Scottish) film was directed by Jonathan Glazer whose other feature film of note is the 2000 UK gangster movie, Sexy Beast. Not knowing quite what to expect, within the first two minutes I was reminded of the famous Monty Python Flying Circus sound bite used to introduce the next and completely unrelated sketch: and now for something completely different . . . Those who insist on an expository narrative should turn away and go elsewhere as theyll be naught but thoroughly frustrated within the first fifteen minutes. It is best characterized as a cerebral, surrealist mystery drama with a sci-fi theme. Its definitely not a sci-fi action thriller, or a horror movie with jump scares and a gore fest. One look at Rotten Tomatoes shows enormous numbers of critics, not just a few, get it, but significant numbers of the general public dont. Those that do not are not ambivalent either. They tend to outright despise the film, using vitriolic language and repeated scatological expletives to voice extreme displeasure. The cause is undoubtedly because this film is unlike 99.99% of contemporary English-speaking Occidental cinema. Its not a 3rd person expository narrative and has near zero dialog. Hence, also, the large number of one star reviews here.

This movie requires patience as its a slow burn, but in retrospect theres a very valid reason. It also requires paying attention from start to finish, and remembering details about whats already been observed that remains a puzzle piece that hasn't fit into the final picture yet. There is very little dialog. The screenplay was inspired by Michel Fabers 2000 novel with the same name, but anyone familiar with the novel will realize very quickly the movie is not an adaptation. It strips the novel down to its abstract core, using its main plot elements and theme while jettisoning narrative details. Those that have seen David Lynchs surreal films will recognize the surrealist nature of this one immediately. Its not symbolic though. What you see is what you get.

The narrative is linear. However, the pieces of information aren't necessarily delivered in an order in which they're immediately useful. The movie starts out with what seems to be the genesis of something that results in someone attempting to make phonetic sounds and pronounce simple words, as if its a literate person whos having to learn how to speak to express thoughts with a vocabulary they already possess. It ends with examining a human eye; IIRC, it has a green iris. Then we have a scene in which a motorcyclist (Jeremy McWilliams) retrieves a comatose woman hidden just off the side of a motorway and puts her into the back of a van where a naked Scarlett Johansson strips off the womans clothes and puts them on. She then drives off in the van, going to a shopping mall to buy more clothes and makeup. We get the impression shes unfamiliar and inexperienced with this. Its followed by her driving the van around Scotland, picking up young men by asking directions, or for other help, and offering them a ride, using her strikingly beautiful appearance to attract them. Shes seeking single men that live alone. Should be clear quickly that they wouldnt be missed very soon if they disappeared.

Rather than give us a 3rd person objective narrative, Glazer and Walter Campbell, his co-writer, want us under the skin with Johansson, experiencing the world and its inhabitants subjectively in the 1st person, as she does. The first major clue were given is the movies title: Under the Skin. Its the point of view were being given throughout: from under Johanssons skin with her. This wasn't immediately obvious to me at the start. I strongly suspected this at about the shopping mall scene. What the film portrayed made much more sense. This POV was quickly confirmed and then reinforced through to the end. A few scenes flip to 3rd person, but they're obvious as were not with Johansson. Any time were with her, were in 1st person.

Going any further would introduce spoilers. The reveals are slow, but eventually theres hardly any mystery left. The reality of whats transpiring is simple and straightforward, but Glazer isn't going to hit the audience over the head with it. What may seem confusing behaviors are very blatant clues about what this unnamed woman is. The one thing I will provide is this: step outside of being human as if you're not (social needs, emotions, ego, id, libido, etc.) and contemplate wondering what being human would be like by observing and interacting with them. Then think about most of Johanssons behavior when shes out it public. She knows how to communicate well, but shes a stranger in a very strange land that doesn't have any social or emotional responses, or empathy in common with anyone around her. She is serving a specific purpose and providing a service for the motorcyclist under his supervision (and there are a few more motorcyclists later). The big reveal, in which all the pieces should fall into place occurs in the denouement at the end, but it shouldn't come as a big surprise either. For me it was confirmation of what I was ready to bet the farm on, although the nature of it was unexpected. Glazer doesn't answer all the questions with the denouement, but its better if he doesn't, as were still under her skin in the last few seconds. Its left for us to go from there in whatever direction we wish, but for Johansson's character, her story is finished, and thats what this film is about, her story. Sometimes leaving the larger story open is much more powerful, and IMO thats the case here. These things didn't come to me immediately at the end. I had to think about this film for a while.

Cross David Lynch with Stanley Kubrick (2001) and Andrei Tarkovsky (Solaris) and add a little Rod Serling DNA. For those who are willing to take on a film that is much different from the mainstream, to paraphrase a few lines from ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" before pushing the play button:
If you must blink, do it now. Pay careful attention to everything you see and hear, no matter how unusual it may seem. And please be warned, if you fidget, if you look away, if you forget any part of what you see, even for an instant, then the story will surely elude you.

6308999,5,B00J22YU62,"Loved it.  Took a while to digest what was bouncing around in my head afterwards (which is entirely the point of art cinema) and that's why I'm giving it so many stars.  Based on the book by Michel Faber, Jonathan Glazer did a great job adapting/creating a very cerebral, primal landscape.  Scarlett Johansson, as always, does a fantastic job here.  Just do yourself a favor and don't walk into this thinking you're going to be watching Vicky Cristina Barcelona or The Avengers or Lost in Translation.  Her character is NOT charming--deal with it!
It is a great movie, however, if you can hang with metaphorical, and eccentric plots.  The pacing and aesthetics are not meant for mass consumption, so if you're looking for casual and lighthearted entertainment, maybe try something else for now.  (Otherwise you'll have a whole lot of wtf?! moments.)  This movie is for when you're in a weird-ass mood and feeling a bit intellectually masochistic--Definitely a black diamond run and requires deep thinking.  When people criticize art films for being too slow, too bizarre or pointless, I can only recite this quote: ""Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.""",1491609600,,1178,5.030927835051546
6309000,2,B00J22YU62,Bizarre and depressing story. Not my cup of tea. Scarlett Johansson was beautiful as always.,1491004800,,92,5.2
6309001,3,B00J22YU62,"The rave reviews on the cover (NYT, WaPo, LA Times) were misleading. It was at times ""mesmerizing""...brief times. It had some wry ironic moments, like when the victims were being disassembled by the black ooze, their erections were that last things to disappear after their insides were totally gone...except the head. The head was the very last.  You might have thought, if you're doing it, as ""they"" presumably were, to gain information about humanity, the head might have been first. Nope. That would bones and guts. But you aren't made of black ooze so maybe you don't get their logic.

The style of the movie, visually and score-wise, is 1960s pretentious art movie. They were fun, this is fun. But most of it is filmed ""straight"" and makes essentially no sense. The few moments of pathos stand out: When the first (presumably over-human and so paralyzed by the overseer) girl is having her clothes stripped off by SJ so ""she"" can get dressed, as ScarJo is ready to disappear a solitary tear leaks out of the eye of the discarded girl.  That was beautiful. But the set up is all art film--belonging to a world where logic does not apply.  When you see the guys disappearing into the black (Nanite?) ooze that SJ walks on like a mirror, and especially when you see the ooze flush into the bizarre red boiler door slot, you think: Ah, they're getting info about us.  BUT: SJ starts out flirting and conversing to perfection with her intended victims. Driving perfectly. Knowing how to navigate Scotland perfectly. Far more attuned to life among the Scots than, say, an American tourist. I had to turn on the English subtitles to understand what some of them were saying. She got it all fine. But she also understood standard English perfectly ""out of the box"".

And the murderous overseer spent his time riding around recklessly on a motorcycle, searching for her perhaps, as though a species that can construct Scar Jo out of black ooze is unable to come up with Lo Jack to track her when she goes rogue.

So on the one hand, a fair amount of it--doing homage to the aforementioned 60s art flicks--was beautiful and portentous. The basic organizing idea was stupid and half-baked. Scar Jo, as always, is good to watch. Some moments really stood out...possibly enhanced by the general absence of anything much going on plotwise. Those moments (aside from SJ being disrobed...yes, it's there, but no, it's not worth getting for that. She's a beautiful woman with or without clothes, it was not prurient) included the tear, the dissolved guys with hard-ons left, SJ looking at herself very humanly after first having sex, and the rape scene where the logger tears the faux flesh off the underlying android? Replicant? Black Ooze mannequin? and it sits holding SJ's peeled-off face in its hands, and the eyes blink at it. Nice touch.

Some other nice touches, the black ooze Johansson initially buckles its seat belt religiously--but after getting ""human"" enough to release the neurofibromatosis sufferer it felt compassion for--it doesn't. It becomes just like the rest of us scofflaws. But part and parcel of the whole effort, she/it also doesn't buckle up at the very first. So that probably wasn't  intentional.

Bottom line: There are pretty shots, there is a quiet atmosphere of imminent revelation, there are some subtle moments of humor or pathos, but at the end of the day, it is beauty signifying nothing.  We even have a shot of the murderous biker doing an homage to ""Interstellar"" for no reason at the end.

If you live in a state with legal pot, it might be a great flick to light up and zone out, muttering every now and then ""Oh....Wow.....man.......""

Some of the images will stay with you. And after awhile you'll probably have forgotten it didn't make sense. It wasn't trying to, it was just about atmosphere. And it did have atmosphere.

In spite of its structural/conceptual flaws, Scar Jo is good enough you can watch it, and it's played straight so it's not irritating.

If I would watch it again I would pop in a Boards of Canada cd and just use the movie as a music video. All and All I think as crude as this was Scarlett Johansson acted well. But did I care? I think the director spent allot of time on the look, but forgot to make it relatable. It is like being in a nuclear winter eye bath. The music drove me batty and how dark parts were made me sleepy. I didn't care for the ending but at the same time the look of the ending was great. I can see this video as a good club background or if they still have raves. It is a good work of art but hard to stay involved with the story. If there were stills of the movie it would make a great gallery show.",1489968000,,775,3.8198757763975157

Her self-discovery is perhaps the most interesting facet of the film, though you don't realize it until later in the story.

6309034,2,B00J22YU62,"Like lost in translation but without the charm and elegant conveyance of melancholy. Super weird and slow, nothing is really explained. I enjoy long bizarre art films, but this was a bust for me . I guess this was meant as a metaphor for how empty life can be, but you'd have to take some serious leaps to pretend to ""get"" anything from the film. I suspect that most people watched this to see Scarlett Johansson naked, which she was, on multiple occasions. I get that, she is beautiful! Even that was not enough to make this worth a full watch (male company agreed).

Some scenes were shot beautifully but it felt like it needed some serious time in the editing room and maybe a touch more plot/dialog.

Similar films that actually made this type of artistic confusion work, in my opinion: Lost in Translation, Melancholia, maybe Solaris.

I think half of the movie is just Scarlett driving around like a uninteresting cash cab.

Spoiler Alert,  summary below....
Some dude brings a dead lady to a weird room. A naked Scarlett Johansson calmly and utterly detached, undresses the body like it was an object (not a sensual scene). She then dresses in the dead lady's clothes. She walks through a mall, gets different clothes and makeup, then drives the guy's van around. The relationship between her and the biker guy (who collected the dead lady) is unexplained and almost indifferent. So she drives this van around asking random people for directions to random places. She asks a couple of questions to see if they have a family or any meaningful connections in their lives.  If they don't,  she takes them back to a door that opens into a biz are place.  The room is endless,  no walls or ceiling visible, floor is black and reflective like a mirror.  She starts undressing and walking into the room,  the guy does the same. By the time she is fully naked,  each step the guy takes is actually downward into the mirror floor, like it was liquid. This repeats a few times, then we see under the floor. It's like and ocean with the bodies sort of decaying into floaty weird things. More confusing and painfully slow non-profit, then credits.",1481414400,,2142,4.652519893899204

There was also a heavy handed political message to it, which I don't necessarily mind, but the film was so bad that it bothered me on top of it.

are compelling aspects that are a draw in non erotigenic ways and in points convey,

eulhemistically, a meaning both of life, it's value in contrast to death and then, sexuality and it's renditions of sexual, psychosexuality, archtypes and selection, selection process, then process.

It is definitely on the ""low-budget"" spectrum as in visually there does not seem to be a whole lot going on, but that shouldn't be a deterrent.

What does this have to do with my review of said movie ?? Not a lot...but hear me out.

How could people be so confused about the plot and list the reason for the rage induced over their ""not being able to get those precious 2 hours"" of their life back after watching this be justified when it tells you right on the back of the dvd case that the movie is about seeing the world through alien eyes??
The plot is about as simplistic as it gets, honestly. Just goes to show that people don't want to give anything different or weird a chance.
It all has to be something that can be immediately understood, that even a kindergartener could go ""AH-HA...I know what's going to happen""

One thing I've noticed with not only music , art, and movies...but especially with people themselves -  people severely hate, resist, and routinely destroy anyone or anything that they can't understand immediately.

 The atmosphere of this movie is extremely interesting, the soundtrack is creepy, the traps the main character leads these people into are surreal and insane and captivating.

  Yeah, if you don't like weird movies then go watch Bridget Jones Diary or American Sniper, something typical where you can pat yourself on the back and say ""That makes so much sense, I am so rational and intelligent for watching something like this"".

  I'll be setting up my own retail sales store just because I like the idea of having a small arcade in the front of the store with gumball machines, malfunctioning ""Hydro Thunder"" machines, and a crane game where you build your own taco salad with mechanical claws for just $4.43 !!!",1475452800,4,1697,4.62

Somehow, this mannequin is in cahoots with a mute motorcyclist, who zooms around but has no lines to explain his presence. At some point more than an hour into the film, the mannequin has the heavily cliched LOOK IN THE MIRROR moment, i.e., the moment in which a character recognizes a personal flaw and changes -- for which the director & writer -- I kid you not -- actually has the character LOOK IN A MIRROR. (Groan). Although the motorcyclist looks into the same mirror, he appears not to have the same apotheosis, and simply spends the rest of the movie zooming around on his Ducati. Meanwhile, the mannequin flees into the country somewhere to avoid luring more idiots into the goo puddle.  I wish I could say there was more to the plot, but there really isn't.  The camera work, sound editing, and scoring are embarrassingly crude and cliche-ridden....it is the sort of quality you might see in a short done by a student. The accents and dialect are really tough going, not only because the mannequin's accent is fake, sounding more like a bastardized LA accent, but also because the other characters' brogue is difficult to parse.

It's a very unique cinematic experience and not something that's easy to explain. When I first saw this movie I would've agreed with most of the 1-star reviews. The ending seemed unsatisfying and the movie made no sense. Worse, the movie just made me feel uneasy.

As I thought about the movie and the commentary it was making, I came around on its clever points. I actually grew to like how little it told you and how much it left for you to figure it out. It doesn't treat you like an idiot like so many movies do nowadays - it treats you as someone who can put together what's going on for yourself and draw your own conclusions.

Johansson's performance is ridiculous - she is truly an amazing actress. There's not much dialogue, which is precisely why she's so good in this. Also, the score is out of this world, so to speak. So much of the movie hinges on the score - director Jonathan Glazer makes good use of it.

If you're in the mood for an odd film that forces you to connect a lot of dots to understand it, you'll really enjoy this film. If you just want something fun to watch or a standard Sci Fi thriller - steer clear of this one.",1474588800,2,1264,4.214876033057851

Considering the script (or lack thereof) I wonder what possessed Scarlett to sign on to this waste of time and otherwise perfectly good film?  Or was it shot on video?

The script seemed like something a 10th grader in their first screenwriting class would come up with.  What little dialog there was did nothing to move the story along or give the viewer any sort of help trying to figure out what was going on.  I have read many other reviews and I often wonder what psychotropic substances the reviewer and the cast of the movie were on when they thought this movie was good.

I suppose if one was only interested in seeing Scarlett naked, this movie would be worthy of several more stars, however, I am no longer a teenager and I expect more from the movies I take the time to watch.  I can only say that the pacing of this movie is mind numbingly slow, the plot is convoluted in the extreme and I will not ever recommend this movie to anyone who will ever ask.

Maybe it is a movie only critics would love...  But then they have to be paid to go see movies.  I go to be entertained and told a good story, and in that this movie falls woefully short on both accounts.",1473724800,,1336,4.24901185770751

6309261,5,B00J22YU62,"One does not simply review this film. After I watched this for the first time, I had to take a few hours to gather my thoughts before attempting this. It's not often when a movie leaves me feeling this conflicted. For simplicity and quick reference, I will try to make a few key points:

1. If you are looking for something fun and amusing to watch while munching on popcorn one evening with your family or friends, this may not be for you. The film is not for everyone, especially because of the content. The rating should tell you all you need to know, but be aware that there is no censorship here. Nudity - though quite tasteful and not vulgar - is definitely present. I can't exactly lump it together with drama/mystery and it didn't feel very much like horror either. It's one of those films that urges you to stay focused. Look away for a moment and you might get lost.

2. If you are searching for something on the non mainstream side, this may be it. When I say that, I mean that this entertains in its own unique way. The audience isn't spoon-fed. I'm not a movie buff by any means, so I can't make any fancy comparisons with classics or whatnot, but this piece definitely broke my personal record for ""strangest movie I've seen in the past five years"". Feeling thoughtful? Pondering the meaning of life? You might need to put on your thinking cap for this one.

The film does something I found wondrous and fascinating - it forced me to start theory-crafting right off the bat and pushed my imagination into overdrive. I was confused; I was baffled; I wanted - no, NEEDED - to know what the heck was going on, and though this ""unknowing"" frustrated me at first, I soon realized that I was watching something incredible.

Scarlett did an incredible job with this role. Some might say it wasn't very challenging because she spent a lot of time as an ""expressionless"" character. However, I disagree. She was ""vacant"" but not expressionless, and the way in which she brought the character to life piece by piece as she became more and more human really blew me away. The acting felt natural. All of the actors were splendid.

This film can definitely fall into the sci-fi category, but I did feel that it was very much about humanity and what it meant to truly be human (rather than aliens or spaceships and such). Empathy is key when relating a story, whether it's on screen like this or in print. From the very first moments that I watched the protagonist putting on clothes, driving around, and searching for lonely lost souls, I somehow empathized with her. She was supposed to be a villain (at least at first), yet I never saw her that way, and at the end, I was so frantic with the need to see her find her own ""humanity"" that I was biting my lip and digging my nails into my armchair.

I believe that that is what made this movie so incredible for me. It made me sit back and think about our world and how we don't appreciate the small things that make us ""people"". Eating, sharing stories and laughter, finding love and passion - these are things we often take for granted. On a personal level, this film moved me greatly. It's definitely one that I'm adding to my collection.

SPOILERS:
The ending scene was incredibly intense. Even as the logger was attacking her and I thought ""he can't really rape her anyway"", the horror was still present because the ""rape"" wasn't so much sexual as it was psychological. It was the shattering of hope, the kind of feelings and emotions that are gut-wrenching and terrifying. To struggle so much, to yearn for so much, and to finally find undeniable proof that the one thing we might want more than anything is unattainable...that is the true horror. Not the aliens, the devouring blackness, or death, but the theft and loss of our dreams.",1472947200,36,3792,4.518950437317784

Under the Skin is a demanding film, and most certainly not a pleasant one, which lingers in the subconscious for days (or even weeks) like an unwelcome houseguest. Hence the apt title, I suppose. Filmed in the guerilla style, with hidden cameras capturing Scarlett Johansson's interactions with all manner of unsuspecting men on the streets of Glasgow, the results are both authentic and rather listless. Somehow understanding the intricacies of conversation and sexual signal-sending, Johansson's alien psyche is completely helpless in baser respects. She wanders the pavement, seeing positive and negative sides of the human condition amidst her aimless stroll, and responds to both with the same apathetic lack of emotion. Eventually it does go somewhere, though much of the plot is left to subtle hints and unspoken subtext, and I'm not sure the destination is worth the effort it takes to arrive. Often very difficult to watch, drastically understated and strangely nuanced, it's a polarizing experience that's probably best suited to quiet, underpopulated art houses.",1471824000,,1213,5.562162162162162

Be sure to listen with your best headphones or your best speakers because the sound design is very important.

The movie is light on dialogue throughout, and the viewer has to use imagination and deduction to determine what they are seeing.

This movie must have been a real challenge for Scarlett Johansson because nearly all of the acting is done with little dialogue. In my opinion, she performed  well, and made the story work. It will probably one day be recognized as one of her strongest acting roles. This movie will one day be a cult classic.

My interpretation is that the story is about a very small group of aliens living among us who must absorb humans to survive. Some of the aliens, are not without moral qualm with what they are doing, but are socially and culturally so different than us that they don't immediately feel anything toward their actions.

If you want a gore alien horror flick, for most of you, this is not it. If you want a clearly explained story that doesn't require you to speculate and imagine, this is probably not it.

6309364,4,B00J22YU62,"This is a tough movie to review.  It starts out with Scarlett Johansson in a short black wig driving a van around looking to pick up guys.  When she finds a likely target she takes him to a deserted house.  There she starts to undress as she walks across a black floor.  Each guy gets all hot and bothered and begins to remove his clothes as he follows her.  Instead of a solid black floor, each man finds himself sinking into a black goo.  This scene repeats itself several times. In each scene Johansson undresses a little more until in the last of such scenes she is completely and frontally nude.  She drives along and picks up one more man.  However the scene ends very differently than the others.  I cannot reveal how for spoiling it for you.
  Under the Skin is a dark movie and the plot is difficult to follow.  It is not your typical Scarlett Johannson action or romantic/drama film.  Those who want to see another side of Johansson and/or see her nude will probably enjoy it - otherwise watch a Marvel Fantastic Four (or whatever they are called.)",1470700800,2,1058,4.447916666666667

The film is avant garde in a big bad way. It's basically a silent film. (No, I did not sync it to Dark Side of the Moon. Too many fast parts in Pink Floyd. Not enough grass in the world.) There are three scenes that are interesting, and they last a total of 4 minutes. The rest is just getting between (literally driving a truck) and listening to near incomprehensible Irish brogues from the natives. A lot of it was shot without the male actors knowing they were on camera and it shows.

The plot was rather engaging, though, as I was curious to see the slow reveals throughout the film. I just wish there were a bit more depth and less ""art"" (sue me if I enjoy slightly clearer storytelling).

Mostly because I have a different perspective on life that not many can swallow and I often will get a lot of backlash telling me how wrong am I. I randomly watch this on Amazon last time because i liked the description. ""Woman of unknown origin"" picking up lost male souls... I think a person's viewpoint on a film like this can be colored by their own life experiences. What I got as the main theme of this film to myself is a female (one would assume but ETs may be genderless) aliens experience as a female human - not in anyway prepared for the horror she would be fall..

She enters Earth which is a heavy sever planet probably more than compared to her own. The reason she is made a skin in female human form because it is the easiest way to lure male humans on this planet which is the goal. She comes here with no prior knowledge of what it is like, why humans and female humans do what they do etc. She is going off of no experience and just following the ""herd"" and her training. Her reactions to certain things she encounters are either nothing or shock - meaning not what would be expected on Earth. She doesn't have those responses (obvious when she falls flat on her face on the sidewalk or seems to be not affected by the cold). They may not exist in her at all because she is not human.  Her expression is of mostly robotic going about her duties. Not being able to trap the last lure I think throws her. Watching all the rest of humans eat, she tries cake and throws it up. She looks like a female human but she can't fully embraces that as she is not. Her reaction to the intercourse was the first negative experiences with the male humans. The look of shock on her face and how wrongly violated  she felt perhaps, not understanding why or what happened. Confusion.

 And even further, attempted rape which cracked her ""mask"" open - I don't know if I was the only one who felt the look of deep sadness and confusion on her face looking down at the blinking mask and then to be set on fire by the insecure male human, frustrated by the failed rape and terrified of the unknown.  Her experience was definitely a taste of the cruel side of what female human existence can be like. If she had survived, I am pretty sure she would never want to come back to Earth again once her mission was completed  I see the film as a bit of a message to how fantasy and female looks are too important on Earth, to the point of obsession, and how that 'under the skin' it may be a reality that others can not deal with it.  Or that on the outside it may not look like much (the disfigured male) but inside there may lie more strength and willpower.  I do wish that there was more explanation on her mission itself. I plan on reading the book as I would be interested in finding out what planet she is from and how different the existence is from Earth.",1469145600,,2898,4.226039783001808

Highly recommend watching with subtitles because even though this movie is stunning in every possible way, the Scottish accent is still one of the most disgusting dialects and certainly one of the most difficult to understand.

Straight up, I made my dad watch this movie on three separate occasions and he still didn't ""get it"", so what is it gonna be? Are you going to side with a modern queer liberal film fanatic with a heart of gold and champagne taste or my prosecco-ass daddy who thinks J.Lo is more talented than Beyonce?

The old timey suspense music brings about a sense of discomfort with everything happening, because the film has a slow paced independent foreign feel.  So, everything except Scarlett Johansson herself when she's mimicking a regular girl, comes off alien.  Overall, I'll summarize this film as carrying a bit of the premise of the film Species with way less effects, combined with the weird feel of Daft Punk's Da Funk video, but with a classic Hitchcock styled score.",1465516800,,791,4.669064748201439

6309681,2,B00J22YU62,"(Yes they show whats under the skin) Maybe if it had released a decade ago as planned it wouldve been better. Typical story of non human seducing humans to service an evil scheme but is changed by the human experience. The problem is its a story thats now been told countless times. Speaking for myself, to get me drawn into this repeat plot would require increasing complexity but this is stripped down to the bones. With the beings human experience being limited to tasting cake, tapping her finger to the beat of music, briefly meeting a non typical person who is nice, and an attempt at intercourse. She never experiences any human emotion aside from a moment of guilt that steers her towards change but that change is never fully realized two main reasons. One, they went with the stereotypical emotionless being and made her the only significant ""character"". Everyone else just comes and goes with little dialog and it leaves us bored as well as everything being overly open ended. Two, the vast majority of the runtime is spent in silence appreciating the cinematography. It has every right to because its absolutely gorgeous but it left no time to develop a decent story or character arch. By the last twenty minutes i was skipping ahead to get through the elongated scenery shots. There is a lot shots that aren't even that great but are still drawn out to the point of feeling like everything is in slow motion. The runtime could've easily been shaved down by 30 minutes. The only saving grace that gets this pretentious work a second star is the visuals. It really is striking. Overall not worth the watch though. Just another elitist piece appealing to those within the industry. With no real characters or solid through line within the linear and boring story.",1464566400,,1773,4.759740259740259

SiFi doesn't have to be cartoonish like Guardians of the Galaxy but it should have a storyline that makes some sort of sense. 2001: A Space Odyssey was not a fast moving story and was confusing at times for some but presented several interesting ideas/questions in a manor that many could understand and ponder.",1464220800,,656,4.79646017699115

They never really go into just why she is doing what she is doing or the fact that in at least the book she is always in pain. I know it was ""based"" on the book but wow that's like saying the movie The Hangover is based on actual real life events. With that much liberty taking from the source material. They should of just called it something else. Yes Scarlett Johansson looks great in the tight jeans and yes you get to see her naked but should that be the reason to watch this??? Nah. It's a good movie to watch while doing laundry. There's about 1 hour worth screen time that Scarlett Johansson is in her van asking for directions and trying to get men in her van. It seems like the movie was a waste of something that could of been really good and made people think ""what is it to be human?"". I was really looking forward to seeing what Scarlett Johansson (looked like naked ha! I'm a guy after all) could of done with the character. All of the internalizing thoughts she has of what she's doing, how she use to look, how tired she is and the fact that she calls herself and her kind human. Reading the book before watching the movie was both a good thing and bad. Good because I knew what the hell was going on and that the movie wasn't just Scarlett Johansson in a van for almost 2 hours. Bad because I knew just how much heart of the story was missing and asking why is no one speaking??? I feel like the movie could of just been call ""In The Van with Scarlett Johansson"". The very little special effects in the movie were cool and Scarlett Johansson is easy on the eye. If that's enough to float your boat for almost 2 hours then cool.

Dialogue is kept to a minimum, the viewer has to figure out what is going on by piecing together the pieces of the puzzle. Viewer must actively participate in the gathering of these puzzle pieces. Scarlet Johhansson shines as she must portray no emotion, but occasionally leak some as she assimilates.

It does have some things going for it, like some really great camera work, powerful and disturbing imagery, and a very unique and haunting score. But there's very little to keep your interest aside from the visuals. It's a slow paced film with almost no dialogue, which is an artistic choice, but something more to give it a slightly more coherent plot and driving force would've been nice. there's also very little horror in this film, but when it shows up, it's extremely effective. in fact, it's so effective that you wish there was more of it. not a complete waste of time overall, but a very, very niche audience and not something i'd recommend for the average moviegoer.",1463184000,,927,4.728395061728395

The plot itself is at the very least inventive, although its progression demanded close attention in order to make sense of (and accept) the irregular jumps in time. My main complaints about this film is that climax left a bit to be desired. The earliest scenes do an exceptional job of establishing the story line and the unnerving mood, without a single unnecessary word spent on character dialogue. The film fails to escalate the plot rapidly enough however. The overarching dilemma introduced was left insufficiently explored.

I couldn't be more impressed with what's done within it not only technically but conceptually as well. A real masterpiece, it decides to use visual storytelling over dialogue or exposition. It's sound design and soundtrack both add a very estranging effect that works for the moody and heavy atmosphere of whats going on. There's a lot of cinematic theory happening in the story having to do with voyeurism, the male gaze, identity in film, and the associated other. A highly rewarding watch for those with this background and even those without but simply willing to take a closer look at the movie. There's an important message here about how we view females, their bodies, and their sexuality in film and everyday life even. In short highly recommended for anyone willing and able to appreciate what's going on in this complex and tragic story. P.S.

6309783,3,B00J22YU62,"Mild spoilers ahead:

I don't mind a tough-provoking film that is heavy on symbolism, nor do I mind one that veers towards abstract; however ""Under the Skin"" has been a bit oversold on its depth of probing the human condition, exploration of alien intelligence, and class/gender politics.  Despite the artistic trappings, this movie is ultimately a simple story of the subject moving from detachment to empathy to breakdown.  This arc creates a circular argument for the ""what does it mean to be human"" inquiry (i.e. to presume empathy for the human condition is to presume a capacity for human-like thinking and values), and attaches familiar motivations to the subject (rebellion against antipathy) that undercut its otherness.  Similarly with respect to politics, it is easy to project class and gender roles on to the subject based on ""the skin"", however this undercuts the idea that ""under the skin"" this is an alien intelligence that, despite using the roles of ""the skin"" to achieve its business, may not even have gender.  If we are indeed meant to project roles based on ""the skin"", then the story collapses in a human story of class/gender injustice which, although poigniant, is over-sold as an exploration of alien intelligence and what it means to be human.",1462752000,2,1270,5.0285714285714285

6309787,2,B00J22YU62,"The novel, by Michael Faber, is a densely layered dark satire with a less-than-perfect ending, but still a good book well worth reading. The film omits all of the satire, almost all of the alien elements that provide the story and the motivation of the main character and turn a dense work of prose into a film where the first line of dialogue doesn't occur until 10 or 15 minutes into the movie. The imagery and the music are excellent, and some of the shots are thought-provoking.

There are some interesting aspects to the movie, and the idea of having the star of the movie drive around trying to pick up hitchhikers without them knowing they are being filmed is one worth future exploration, but could have been done here in a much shorter film. Kudos also goes to the filmmakers for recruiting someone with neurofibromatosis to play the role of a person with the disfigurement, rather than rely on prosthetics.

Ultimately, this is a very divisive movie and not one to watch if you are expecting a fast pace or densely plotted movie. If you have time and are open to looking at something different, then it is worth a look.",1462752000,,1129,4.584158415841584

6309859,4,B00J22YU62,"I remember being disappointed with Michel Fabers book, although a decade has passed since I read it and I can no longer remember exactly why. I do, however, remember enough about the novel to note that Glazer and Campbell have pared it down to the bone to produce a rather distant, abstract interpretation of Isserleys (as shes named in the book) conflicted feelings towards humanity and her attempts to understand us. Its bleak and ambiguous and, surprisingly, more successful, and powerful, than the book. Johannsens performance is mesmerising, and perfectly pitched. Glazer has opted for a naturalistic style, which is unusual and quite brave given the nature of the source material. Its also strikingly photographed and has a compellingly eerie soundtrack. All-in-all the film is a successful depiction of the main characters struggle to come to terms with her actions and her attempts to understand the world around her. But for some viewers, especially those who are unfamiliar with the novel, it may all seem rather odd, and they might find themselves wondering what the hell is going on.",1461456000,,1095,5.122905027932961

6309897,1,B00J22YU62,"I have read reviews that absolutely rave about this film saying its disturbing, haunting, poignant, beautiful and mesmerizing. Well my dear readers I think these people watched a completely different film from the one I viewed; I found it creepy, boring, confusing, and pointless. I guess what this says isyou will either love it or youll hate it there is absolutely no middle-ground. You can tell by my 1 star rating where I stand on this one.

Normally I really enjoy ScarJos work, I usually find her pretty entertaining no matter what shes doing, this time though she felt lost, dead and out of her depths to me but I cant really pin the blame on this on her though; I blame it on the direction. Personally, I think someone decided to get a bit too artsy-fartsy with this film because the only way you as a viewer actually have any clue of whats going on is if youve read the book Under the skin by Michael Faber.

The director had a serious brain-fart in how he approached this film. There is absolutely NO dialogue whatsoever for the first thirteen minutes of the film; just a lot of ScarJo (aka the female)  driving around in a van talking to and picking up strange menand it doesnt change much from that format throughout the entire film. I swear this had to have been the easiest script to learn in modern history!

For the longest time I thought she was some sort of deranged serial killerI honestly think if she had been that would have made for a more interesting story, but while I suppose she was in a sense a serial killer (she did kill men) I had no idea why she was killing them and as the movie went on and on and on in much the same way it started I just got more and more confused. I know I had to have been sitting there watching it with an am I really still watching this?! expression on my face.

I kept watching it though, why in the world did I keep watching? It was as if I was drawn in thinking this really cant be THAT bad. ScarJo wouldnt be in a movie this horriblewould she? It was much the same as the morbid fascination rubber-neckers have at the scene of an accident. I held out this tiny ray of hope that somehow something would eventually make sense..sigh, it never did.

So, having endured an hour and forty-eight minutes of my life I can never get back I decided I just simply had to figure out why this book was turned into a film. Obviously the book had to be much much better. Turns out, thats exactly the case.the book is much, much better and I can see why.

Here Im going to inject spoilers about the movie, normally I don't do this but this movie made so little sense it needs some explanation.so SPOILER ALERT!

The book explains to us who ScarJos character actually is, an alien called Isserley who has been sent to Earth to harvest humans as food, turns out they're a delicacy on her planet; Isserley uses her attractive human female form to lure men to where she lives and the men are never seen from again.

So, oknot a huge spoiler alert, theres much more to the book but it doesnt make its way into the movie. Characters pop in and out but you as the viewer are clueless as to who they are, or why they are there. She interacts with a male character from time to time who rides around on a motorcyclebut they don't tell you why. They mention his name but thats it. I later learned from the book that this is her direct Supervisor, Esswiswho was also directed to take human form and come with her to Earth to well.supervise.

As far as the viewer can tell all ScarJo does is drive and wander aimlessly around Scotland almost never speaking. Occasionally she picks up a man (apparently he must look tasty), takes him back to her home where they both end up stripped and she then slowly walks backwards, he follows her mindlessly until he sinks into some dark abyss where he end up a drowned flattened meat suit.  Its just creepy and weird.

The ending of the movie is just as strange and really, quite abrupt. The whole ride just felt like one long rubber-neck at a car wreck to menot really sure there were any survivors.

I really suggest buying the book and reading it as its actually pretty interesting but skip the movie completely; youll thank me for warning you off of it.",1460937600,11,4227,4.348984771573604

6309937,5,B00J22YU62,"The ending is sad; and the surprise for me was that I ended up pulling for the pretty-killer alien.  The film though, stands on its own as a beautiful work of cinema. The way it is shot is haunting and beautiful. A highly recommended sci-fi/horror movie for those interested in a visual treat. Anyone who didn't pass the marsh-mellow test need not waste their time on an attempted viewing.

Again this is a cerebral alien/horror movie, though, there are moments that feel so real.  The couple who are out on the beach, with the wife being swept away...  The following actions are so painful, and understandable, that there is a complete disaster unfolding.  When I bump into friends who have watched this movie, there will be these moments that I may have forgotten, but they were very vivid and incredible cinema.  And then at the end of the talks: ""remember the baby?""  Yes, I remember.

It's an incredible complement to say this has visual element that remind me of Tarkovsky or Kubrick. Glaser has made an interesting movie that will be watchable and a topic of conversation far into the future.",1459123200,3,1099,4.717277486910994

good actress in other movies I've seen her in !!!!

I really gave this film a good try, but about 45 minutes into it when the only things that had happened was a woman driving around in a van stopping to ask directions from random men that I couldn't understand. She'd pick them up and sometimes, not always, take them ??? start taking off her clothes which lured them to do the same. As they walk towards her they would sink but she would not.

6309940,5,B00J22YU62,"There's a bunch of reviews that go into detail here so I'll give my one paragraph review.

If you want to turn your brain off and be entertained (which often I do), this movie isn't for you. If you like thinking a lot about a movie, this is pretty good. I don't think it requires a genius to understand, but it does require some amount of thought. Maybe it is slow, maybe not, but it's definitely tense. That tension kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. After it was over, I spent the next several days periodically thinking about it.",1458864000,,551,4.19811320754717

6309943,5,B00J22YU62,"I was surprised by the amount of vitriol hurled toward this movie.

The most prominent complaint is that the movie is slow. This is true. If your brain requires a hard cut every 2 seconds coupled with constant chatter (read: if you thought ""Transformers"" was a good movie), then you'll definitely hate this.

The next target for complaint seems to be the narrative. I get the impression that the narrative is a little more abstract than some viewers are used to. If you often complain about movies being ""artsy"", then there is a pretty good chance you'll hate this.

Also, if male or female full frontal nudity makes you uncomfortable for some strange reason, you'll hate this.

If you're still reading, I'll assume you haven't already made your mind up about this movie. If you're looking for something dark, highly sexualized, slow-burning, intellectually and emotionally challenging, and heavy on atmosphere, then give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. You might be too.",1458518400,,978,4.9815950920245395
6309944,3,B00J22YU62,"This movie is 1 hour and 48 minutes.  By the end, I would have sworn I'd been sitting there for 2.5 hours.  I don't mind a slow-paced movie, but I don't need to see a character sit in a van doing very little for so long.  Many other scenes could have also been shortened.  I don't need to see five minutes (I'm exaggerating) of random people walking along the street.  The surveillance-camera feeling, which occurred in some scenes, seemed out of place.

Many viewers liked the score, but I found it annoying.  Each time the alien female's ""siren song"" played, I was taken out of the film.  The siren song wasn't subtle; it was as if the filmmakers were yelling, ""This is the part where you should feel creeped out!""

Complaints aside, the movie presented (very slowly) an interesting view of humanity.  Under the Skin is a movie that has ""room for interpretation,"" which can be a bad thing or a good thing.  In the case of this movie, I'm leaning toward good because it has at least compelled me to write something here.",1458518400,2,1021,4.494565217391305

6309960,1,B00J22YU62,"If you have ""nothing but time on your hands"", then this is the movie you've been waiting for.  And I truly, literally mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G!  Reading the short description for this movie sounded so intriguing, I couldn't wait for a chance to do some real good deep couch sittin' and not remove my eyes from the screen for a second!  Anticipating a little hipster-cred b/c I've never heard anyone speak of this movie before, I was ready to take in what I was sure would be a complete masterpiece that I could say... ""Of course you haven't seen it, you're just not as super-hip and cool as me yo!

Unfortunately... this was not the case.  I know, I know I saw it only had a 2.5 star rating but I was just assuming it was rated poorly by those who weren't true fans of Sci-Fi, Horror-ish, Effed up, Crazy movies like me.
As it started... I actually inspected our TV thinking the picture went out b/c of the long black-screen.  The light that appeared seemed to freeze or pause or some other thing I didn't know how to fix. Which caused me to review my internet connection and then the Roku.  Nope, just fine.  The timing of both the blackout and the light seemed to me the equal of a very long awkward silence during a long, dull, blind date neither party wanted to be a part of. BUT, I was going to give this movie my undivided attention and get all mental with it. Put my cell on vibrate, brought anything and more that I might have cause to need... Tissues? Check!  Snacks? Check! Blanket to snuggle in on couch? Check!  Small dog so I don't get lonely?  Double Check!
The movie is picking up now, we're actually starting to look at images. People moving-sometimes talking.  Very little dialogue here. Then it happened, 30 mins into this snooze-fest... My mind started to wander!  No longer entertained by the film ( or maybe never entertained? I dunno?) It starts... ""What do I cook for dinner?  Is today Monday?  Who invented Purple?  Do I smell Cheese...?""  Ugh! ""Stop this!"" My inner voices were telling me to stick this out.
Hipster-cred is hard to come by now-days, especially for chicks b/c we can't compete in ""Beard Wars"" and honestly learning to play a musical instrument that no one has heard of before or that I DIY'ed out of toilet paper rolls, box twine, and elastic bands just isn't on my bucket list. Listening to and watching ""new"" music and movies is the laziest way to get hip.  I'm OK with that.
Around the time I remember seeing a floating body condom ( shape of human body, translucent, looked as if it was thin latex) in a sea of blue, {or a blue room I'm not even sure} I started thinking of all the things that were completely unnecessary to work on or finish pre-movie that were becoming more and more critical with every ticking second.  Thoughts running through my mind, plaguing me with worry.  "" That root canal can no longer wait, now is the time!  Did I scrub the baseboards when I mopped?  I have got to freshen up that resume`, now!  It is imperative that all socks in this house are matched at this very moment!""

End result:  I didn't realize how many socks I didn't have matches to!  Oh, but the movie sucked.  I don't even think I finished.  I walked away to match socks, re-balance the check book, and count all the dried beans in my cabinet without stopping the movie or turning off the TV.
So, if you have a pile of chores ahead of you and no motivation?  This movie is a wonderful tool!  Entertainment? No.  Also, I found out later that yes, it had been heard of by everyone and no, even if I had sat through it there was no hipster-cred to been had.  Or anyother category of  ""cred"" for that matter.",1458172800,2,3639,4.4077961019490255

Yeah, that's a good use of your interstellar gas.

And our alien Venus fly trap shows not a whit of emotion, whether she sees a whole family drowning in front of her, a baby abandoned on a beach, a man who tries to rescue the family (whom she then snuffs)--until she happens to look in a mirror and suddenly discovers a conscience.  If she had any conscience to begin with, why would she be OK with horrifically murdering a sentient species?  Are we supposed to feel sorry for this serial killer after she improbably acquires a conscience?

And then there are all the lovely humans she encounters.  With maybe one exception, their only objective is to sleep with her, rape her, or murder her.  Should we have any concern for these beings?

What, really, are we supposed to take away from this flick?  Beware, good looking girls may be out to eat you?  Beware, guys only want your body (perhaps for murder)?

I wanted the movie to hurry up and be over already because it was so abstract, seemed so long keeping the viewer wondering what the hell is going on until the last few minutes, which allowed the viewer to actually see what was happening. Great ending, but it was then too late to enjoy the sci-fi special effects of what was shown at the end. Overall, it was just too slow and they wasted what could have been a great scifi movie plot.

It is dark, disturbing, mysterious, and you have to use you brain to figure out what is happening. There are layers upon layers of meaning, as well as stunning visuals. Large pieces of the story happen off screen so you have to assemble it in your head.
The monster in your imagination is always more frightening than the one on screen.
The dialogue is mostly improvised and has little impact on the narrative.
Comparisons to Kubrick are well founded, though not perfectly analogous.
This movie hearkens back to a time when audiences were expected to be able to think for themselves. Some movies of the late 60s and early 70s (good and bad) had this trait, but studios realized that not everyone was willing to go along with that, so in order to make more money, movies got dumbed down, and that's why terrible, forgettable, mundane movies like 'The Martian' get nominated for best picture. They are aimed at the lowest common denominator.
Escapism in movies is a totally valid desire and I can enjoy those too, but this film is a work of art to be explored and pondered and if you are open to it, you will be haunted by it for a long time. A masterpiece.",1455408000,4,1344,4.534979423868313

6310155,5,B00J22YU62,"A haunting original film utilizing the alien visitation with a killer agenda theme, but this one has a bit more under the guise of a common sci-fi thriller. You'll either get this and find an intriguing master work, or not and give it a one star review becasue of the abandoned baby on the beach scene, Scarlett Johansonn is enchantingly detached, effortlessly sublime in her portrayal of the being doing the visiting, carrying out a strange and ultimately grizzly task of luring men to their doom. A sort of nod to the black widow, as her victims follow her into surreal blackout environments with black liquid floors. Expecting sex, they walk forward to her and are absorbed, as she walks on water as it were. These aliens appear to have all the conscience of insects or reptiles on the surface. She is rehearsed and has a beautiful appearance for one purpose to quickly seduce men. Otherwise she appears cold and oddly devoid of emotion when not on task, with only the slightest hint of ""against her will/per the requirements"" aspect to it. This goes along well enough until one victim elicits a sort of identity crisis, perhaps this alien has become to familiar with her prey, enough to develop a confusing sense of compassion. Soon after falling into this all too human state, she goes rogue, disillusioned. Now the alien hunter is vulnerable to the alien prey. Earth is seen as the cruel alien world as much as these beings might ever be from. Her motorcycle riding henchmen, assistants, guardians, monitors, whatever you can call them, clean up after her, disposing of evidence. There is one scene on particular with him overlooking a snowy landscape, that has the effect of projecting the viewer into his perspective. These are visitors on an alien world...ours. In fact there is an important reason, if shocking per standards and morals of the human race...this is about the cruelty of nature, an alien one, and an earthly one, how these definitions exist purely based on cultural aspects...insects don't have emotions about the dead mouse they are devouring, they would not last as a species very long if they did.",1455148800,16,2124,4.837912087912088

Perhaps better if viewed while stoned, as a big budget movie leveraging the box office ka-ching of a celebrity, the scriptless, plotless film noir without the noir seems to be just a bit too distracted with nudity and repetitiously goes nowhere.  It seems like an interesting opportunity wasted.  Whether it's feeble fumbles of the editing, or the tedium of the director, you'll find yourself answering the question ""What happens if high school film students were given free rein and unlimited budget?""  (answer: a clumsily spliced stack of repetitious, stultified, incongruous one acts.)
How might this movie be enjoyed: The expectation of science fiction or horror distracts from the opportunity to follow the story with no preconceived notion.  I'd suggest letting it take its path, follow along, try to be unadulterated, I think that's the role of the audience for a movie that strives to stimulate thought and imagination.  You'll find no film festival gem here.",1454630400,3,1257,5.318181818181818

I kept suffering through it waiting for this to go somewhere interesting or meaningful, but no, it was just a grievous, weird, waste of potential.  Let's be clear that there was potential here, and more importantly that it was unrealized.  Fail.  There is also an unnecessary cruelty about it, a deliberate effort to break boundaries in poor taste which deserves adamant denunciation. If a filmmaker is going to drag us through all those vile qualities I listed he or she is obliged to at least finish the story with something that makes us see some sort of value in having endured them.  Not the case here.  Fail.  If you as a viewer make the mistake of starting this, please know that you will not find satisfaction in finishing it.  Stop while you are ahead.

6310309,2,B00J22YU62,"I was not impressed. I like a good sci-fi, Scarlett Johansson has a good body but this movie was just too slow and really didn't say very much for how much time it took to say it. And it only hints at many things and leaves much up to interpretation. I haven't read the book and I'm not familiar with the director this may be affecting my comprehension of the movie. But as a stand alone movie I'd say this was for the most part a dud. There isn't much acting going on. There is virtually no action. Special effects aren't to die for. Storyline is very vague. And character development in my opinion is fairly weak especially since the only character that they develop at all is Scarlett Johansson's. Everyone else pretty much plays just a bit part. Besides the biker who never says a word and they just kind of leave him hanging. This was a very cerebral movie, but still didn't say very much. I watched this movie because a site said this was the best movie of 2014, have to seriously call into question their standards. Wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but still pretty much a waste of time, if you're looking for a good movie to watch that will entertain you.",1453593600,,1168,4.362385321100917

In the book, she is in constant pain due to her surgeries and most of the men she meets, deserve their fate.

She is either evil in nature herself or just wanted the payday that came with making the movie for the sick writer and director?  My guess is both actually. But yeah, what a complete waste of time to watch. Her character barely even speaks in the movie which is a good thing I suppose considering what her evil character is doing to the poor unsuspecting young males she or it lures in by using her body. It won't take you long to figure out she is not even human. But rather some kind of evil being from someplace disgusting!  There is one spot early on in movie where she looks to the sky. And it seems the writer is suggesting beings from another point in space?  But you will have to judge for yourself? If you are a deeply demented person or just evil and full of hate then maybe this is the kind of movie you will enjoy you sick freak!  Watcher beware!  It's a purely evil movie and you may need to clense yourself with a prayer or two and some holy water after watching this!?  Very disturbing that not only a writer would come up with such filth.

how come she can talk while she is seducing men, but not at the end?  it kinda reminded me of the horsemen of the apocalypse at the end when all the bikers took off looking for her after the main male had beat up mister big head.  i think alot of this story ended up on the cutting room floor, i  say this because i automatically felt like i had walked in on the middle of a conversation, watching this movie, and was trying to play catch up without interrupting.

if i had to compare movies, i would go all the way back to speilburgs first one where he had the semi chasing the car.  very little dialog in that movie as well, but i never felt near as lost.",1453161600,2,893,4.062857142857143
6310351,5,B00J22YU62,"Jonathan Glazer's ""Under the Skin"" is not an action-adventure sci-fi popcorn flick. It is, in the best science fiction literary tradition, a thoughtful look at the human condition.
Scarlett Johansson's alien character, driving around Scotland in a van, is on a metaphorical birth-life-death journey as well. With each encounter, each stop, she acquires a human trait of increasing complexity, from shallow chit-chat and filling survival needs through group behavior, humor, pity, mercy, love, and fear.
Along the way she is shadowed by her patriarchal alien overseer who seeks to set boundaries on her development. The point at which he intervenes is telling, and the alien ""She"" ditches her van and overseer to learn more. In the process she shows more humanity than many of us can muster.
""Under the Skin"" is beautifully crafted but difficult to watch. The opening ""birth"" sequence and scenes around Scotland are gorgeous, but there are several heart-rending scenes, and the demise of some characters is visually arresting. Those watching for prurient reasons or who are unwilling to put some thought into it will be disappointed. The pace is Kubrickian and, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", what little dialog there is is largely meaningless in terms of plot.
In the end, this movie challenges us to think about what is under our skin. Inside ourselves we will find predator and lover, vulnerability and callousness, patriarch and feminist, victor and victim. But in what proportions?",1453161600,95,1484,5.239495798319328

It's stylistic in a way that I love but that goes against what common movie goers want. It's Kubrickian in pace and it's disassociation of humanity in it's characters but in Glazer's own sensationalist fashion. I love both of them to begin with. That tied with Scarlett Johansson's great acting abilities and absolute beauty, the breathtaking landscapes and cinematography, and still enjoying this movie on a repeat viewing I have to give this movie a 5 star rating.

I only know this because I actually HAD to watch this movie as part of a previous job. In fact, I watched it SIX times in four days. I'll be honest, the first time screening it felt mostly like a slow, dull slog - at that point I would have agreed with (nearly) everything that has been written in the one-star reviews - seriously, sometimes the only reason to stay with it (aside from the fact that I was being paid to watch it) was, of course, Scarlett Johansson herself. No matter what movie/role she is in, you can't look away.

After a few more viewings, the real plot and message of the film slowly reveals itself. All the seemingly ""random"" moments and vignettes make more sense... trust me: Even though this movie has a verrrrry slow pace, you're going to miss a lot the 1st time around.

It shure was.
It has parts from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and parts from EX MACHINA(The ending). That's what I felt.
Because since I felt that I already previously saw similar imagas from other films already, I wouldn't say this movie is truely original.
Some of the shots are pretty cool but some of them are pretty too long and they are too boring. I would say it could be 1 hour instead of 1:40:00.
I don't know Scarlett used the body double but if she didn't she was brave exposing her body that much because I know she is not naked in the other movies at all.
Back to the novel. The novel was very simple so I think the director had a lot of interpretations and there are a lot of inserted images which is to make the audience think and imagine more what they are about. Some of the images fail to deliver and some succeded.
Above all, I don't know I would watch this movie again and this movie is definately not comparable to one of the Andrei Tarkovsky's movie.

In part two the released victim gets kidnapped by some random motorcyclist, who steals some random car. After that the random motorcyclist aimlessly travels around the town. I have no idea what happened to the stolen car or victim or whoever that motorcyclist is.
In part tree the woman gets into some relationship with some random guy and then runs away into the wood. Some other random guy tries to rape her, but damages her skin.

6310389,5,B00J22YU62,"NOTE: This is a review of the book AND the movie--sort of a compare contrast deal.

One of the most haunting stories I've ever read. It's so creative I can barely believe it. Still, slow-motion nightmarishness. A mix of the philosophic and gruesome blood hash death! It gets the Kelly D. Snuff Maximus Award for nastiness and blood drenched slaughter. If they ever made a movie that followed the book strictly, it'd make John Hurt's chest exploding scene seem like Winnie the Pooh getting his head stuck in a pot of honey.

Isserley is an extremely surgically-altered alien female who drives around Northern Scotland in search of fresh meat; alien as in outer spacenot from Central America or Syria. Not that she or her peers can eat such meat; earthling/vodsel is a delicacy on her planet. It's far too expensive for her class to purchase. They were allotted the poorer-quality mince, the necks, offal and extremities. Lovely. Yeah, Isserley is from an unnamed planet choking on its own runaway pollution. The wealthy, ""elite,"" live their entire lives inside and let the lower classes provide their sustenance and riches. Therefore, obviously, Isserley's is a low-level job, but still considered above the drudgery of working in the ""New Estates,"" located in a hideously overpopulated and claustrophobic underground. Its a more technologically advanced type of Morlock society, if you will. In the minds eye they think of themselves as the civilized society, and humans as the savages. However, these aliens actually seem to be physically closer to what vodsels call canine. Michel Faber does a great job of translating their native thoughts and communications into English without being the slightest bit intrusive.

Interestingly, theres a category of space traveling elites from her planet that would be labeled here on earth as tree-hugging environmentalist whackos. Isserley hates them. In fact, when one of these alien environmentalists comes to planet earth, Amlis Vess, he releases three of the captive vodsels which were being prepared for slaughter. After which, theres a nightmarish, keystone cops slapstick scene wherein Isserley and a meatpacking laborer have to hunt down the fugitive vodsels before they're found out! Its cold, and the naked, grotesquely-fattened-by-space-steroids vodsels are shivering and turning blue; their bodies bloated like Michelin men. Their teeth have been pulled and they're castrated for good measure. They cant talk and only moo. S*** drizzles down their overfed, stammering legs. After this Benny Hill saxophone corralling situation ends, the two exhausted chasers look at each other and start to laugh. Unbelievably hellish hijinks, eh?

Isserley knows earthlings far better than the elites do. The elites have only heard rumors that vodsels can communicate with any sophistication. When Isserley tours the vodsel stockyards with Vess, one swollen, mewing vodsel writes out the word mercy in the dirt floor of their corral. Vess is curious if it means anything. Isserley says of course not. She knows that vodesels can write, however. She's watched enough TV to know that. Nonetheless, she misinterprets the word as murky. She does not provide information about vodsels to the nobles because she despises humans like Amlis Vess. Isserley is not a happy space camper. Her cynicism runs deep. She thinks vodsels are shallow, empty animals. They lacked siuwil, mesnishtil, slan, hunshur, hississins, chail and chailsinn. They couldn't siuwil, they couldn't mesnishtil, they had no concept of slan. In their brutishness, theyd never evolved to use hunshur; their communities were so rudimentary that hississins did not exist; nor did these creatures seem to see any need for chail, or even chailsinn. These terms obviously relate to the intellectual and philosophical depth of her civilization. At the very end of the novel, you get a glimpse of the Buddha-like nature of these elements in her culture.

Isserley is brutally raped by a serial murdering vodsel in a scene that made me wanna puke.

His penis was grossly distended, fatter and paler than a human's, with a purplish asymmetrical head. At its tip was a small hole like the imperfectly closed eye of a dead cat.

After a minute with his urine flavored flesh in her mouth, the knife-blade on her neck was
lifted slightly, replaced by hard stubby fingers.

'Murky,' she pleaded.

Thankfully, she hideously kills this scumbag.

This ordeal drives Isserley a bit insane, which manifests itself in a temporary gory-maximus-blood-lust; she brings in a sedated vodsel and demands that she be allowed to watch his grisly, thick gouts of crimson castration. This adds to her already complete and everlasting cynicism. Too bad her revenge-by-proxy is taken out on a genuinely good vodsel. Between the grotesque inequality of her culture, and the barbarism of most of the vodsel males she meets on her travels, it would be bizarre if she was NOT filled with hopeless pessimism.

The message is pretty clear, male vodsels blow.

I have some problems with the book. For instance, the aliens have to know that vodsels can build cars, planes, and even rocket ships. But they don't know if they can write? What the hell was Faber thinking? What the hell were his editors thinking? Unless I missed something, this is an egregious f-up. I could not blame someone for not liking this book because of that major flaw. But I'm a forgiving reader. My philosophy is that in a fictional world, anything can make senseeven nonsense. In art, sometimes pieces don't fit together correctly without the flaws. It doesn't sound right.

Under the Skin, the movie, doesn't have this flaw. It's even more of a feminist story than the book, and the book is plenty feminist. The book's story telling is extremely loud, whereas the movie's story style is deafeningly quite. The cinematic version is made even more chilling because of the stark contrast between the quiet characters and the in-your-face, roaring sound design and score. Also, the movie is fast, the score is not. Silence is a powerful, POWERFUL tool. A book is wall-to-wall, rock 'n roll movement. Of course, a novel DOES give us a lot of information that we have ponder in solitude, and that's a completely in-your-head sort of silence. The final scene reminded me of the burning dowry deaths of the Middle-East, as well as our burn-the-victim-not-the-rapist culture.

The suggestion is that in the woman that the movie centers around there lies an alien character beneath her stunning and exquisite beauty that she uses to mesmerize men.  She hunts mercilessly.  There is no middle ground.  She is a predator at the beginning of the film, and later, she becomes prey.  Then men hunt her, and they display an alien nature to the ""alien"".  The woman's strange alien nature is on display and destroyed.  This rather silent peculiar film hints at an alien nature in each one of us.  There is the outside, social aspect of our lives, and then there is an inside, under the skin, dark and alien to others.  I recommend this film, but do not expect to appreciate its strangeness immediately.",1451174400,2,815,4.683098591549296

6310410,5,B00J22YU62,"Having purchased this on nothing more than a brief glimpse of a preview and a highly recommended review from a local critic, I decided to give it a shot. Knowing anything about this film does a great disservice to it, since its mystery is a large reason for its success. Even the summary on the DVD box was too much, spoiling the nature of the characters depicted before I'd even had a chance to turn it on. I wish I had avoided reading it. The methodical way it reveals information is hypnotizing specifically because it leaves very little explained. There are no grand monologues for the audience's benefit, the puzzle is completed by piecing it together yourself from the clues.

This is a fascinating, dark and disturbing depiction of something we've seen numerous times before in movies, but rarely in such an understated tone. There are lengthy sections featuring a woman on the prowl, our main character who is never named, scanning the city streets for those unlikely to be missed in their lives. Whatever she is, it becomes clear quite early on she is not quite human. She knows enough about human nature to draw in her victims, but she is not human herself. A brutal killing on a beach while a young child cries nearby is about as unsettling a scene as any I've seen in recent memory. It reveals much about her character without telling us a thing: she isn't inhumane -- she just doesn't see the child as anything worth her attention.

Scarlett Johansson is phenomenal in this. Her stilted mannerisms and off-kilter delivery simply add to the effect of a human-like entity trying to act like one of us. She is also responsible for the funniest moment in the film: trying to have sex, she comes to the horrific realization that she's not built for it. It is both tragic and comedic in the same moment, and does so without saying a word. While this may not be Oscar material, Johansson is the heart of the film. Without her, it would not have worked nearly as well as it does.

While there are times when it seems to lose its focus, and the lengthy scenes of her on the hunt can test a viewer's patience, there is something eerie which draws the attention. It is not a perfect film, and I'm almost afraid to pick up the novel it is based on (which, judging from the book's description, is different at least in her choice of targets). The film leaves plenty unsaid, and ends explaining almost nothing. When the credits roll, you may either think you've witnessed a near masterpiece or a complete miss. I fall into the former group, but know enough people who fall into the latter.",1450569600,,2588,4.573275862068965

I concluded that the movie took on an observational style than what viewers were expecting.  The film shows that Scarlett is an alien covered in human skin and has a side kick that helps her out if needed.  Is her helper an alien?  We don't know.  Why is Scarlett here on Earth and why she is doing this to men and/or how it is helping her and/or her home planet?  We don't know.  Give it a go if you want something different.  Not really knowing her intentions kind of made it more cool and horrifying.  The film just shows her luring lonely men, after a brief interview, to have sex with her at her place.  Then you see each man walking toward Scarlett full blown naked and then end up sinking in some cool looking black/silver goo?  lol.  Maybe that's how they got the film financed by paying Scarlett a lot of money to get naked for just a scene?  I don't know.  It wasn't as bad as some reviewers have pointed out.

An alien species is harvesting isolated humans for DNA.

I noticed that 0 of 3 people liked my review, which is fine, however, it would be VERY HELPFUL if you were to add a comment so I might understand what you did not like or agree with or found lacking in my review so I might do better in the future. Thank you.",1449273600,,1195,3.9791666666666665

6310542,1,B00J22YU62,"As to this movie Scarlett, frankly I didn't give a damn for it.  The director used, or better abused, your A-list talents as an actress.  Wardrobe did your beauty no favors.  The film was over filter too dark making even day light look dark.  The thick Scottish accent made me turn on the closed caption which further detracted from any film nuances that would have, or, may have shed more light on theme.  The lame attempt to show your character development, your mid-western accent turning British, growing empathy and  other such scenes seemed to be walking along then just fall into a black hole. And, the nude scenes... wholly beneath your dignity.  This film was best summed up with the diner scene where you carefully take a fork of dark chocolate cake (with I'd bet mocha frosting) and spit it (twice) back onto the plate.

In my heart of hearts I hope there was frequent use of a body double for your character, you fired your agent, please never work for this director, and distance yourself from this film.  Another ''Lucy'' or its' sequel (by the same writers and production company) I'm sure would be a winner.  Any film that shows your depth of range and real talents, the ability of unspoken clear meaning read only in your eyes and slightest of smile.  I'm still a fan, but, this film was painful to watch.",1447804800,3,1322,4.6068376068376065

The richly saturated colors in numerous scenes were appealing, and the shot framing led me along nicely without beating me with symbolism.

6310614,2,B00J22YU62,"This movie is almost an experimental film blend of Man Facing Southeast (or also The Man who Fell to Earth) and Lifeforce. Some elements could be straight out of the Men in Black franchise, but there is little to no humor evident. Were it not for the final scene I would simply call it an experimental film, but as it is things that have been vague or ambiguous do eventually become clear (or at least explicit to the eye of the camera.)

Synopsis with mild spoilers:

A pair (or group) of space vampire types go around picking up subjects for use of their skin and possibly other qualities. A scene where a girl is dispossessed of her clothes somewhat indicates this (the clothes could be seen as a stand in for the eventual reveal of the use of skin.)  We follow the female vampire as she drives around picking up guys (all who seemingly attempt to have their way with her.) If a subject is not the right type or he doesn't show the correct responses he is rejected. Subjects who are chosen are taken to this black oily chamber and are swallowed up by the darkness (details will become clearer as the movie goes on,) but as it is the first sequences are very cryptic and lack any sort of explanation. This happens several times.
A man is encountered at a beach and is seemingly rejected: he doesn't pay mind to the girl and instead attempts to rescue a drowning man (or couple.) This is not the correct response and he is violently rejected.
Another man who shows some facial deformity is picked up and is taken to the oily chamber, but is rejected as well. The rejection may be because of the deformity, but also because his (sexual) responses were not the correct ones. Not only that, the introduction of this man into the chamber changes the program of the alien 'girl,' and she apparently stops her search of subjects. She becomes more human and attempts to adopt human behavior and acts only to utterly fail - she is still unable to engage in normal human activities.
Another one of the aliens apparently starts chasing her (to destroy? to arrest?) and we are led to the final turn of events.

The movie is very slow and vague (maybe even exasperating) and it is obviously not for general audiences. Were it not for the end ""explanation"" I would not have liked it as much as I did..",1446422400,,2289,4.4688995215311005

This is a parable of human sexuality and emotional alienation. The woman leads the man to his demise. The man has his way forcibly with the woman. (I am avoiding a word here so as not to trigger Amazons censors.)

Theres a deep sense of female versus male and male versus female reality under the skin of this film.  Something like that. I like the idea of combining science fiction elements with a kind of deep psychology about human beings. On a more concrete level the film is a bit weird since there seems no reason for the woman (Isserly in the novel) to be seducing and killing these men. The suggestion that she is starting to discover her own sexuality is not developed and seems almost tacked on. Or maybe something is missing or maybe its just me. I think reading the novel by Michel Faber, from which the film was adapted, would help the viewer understand the film.

At any rate this is original and very much worth seeing, if only for Scarlett Johansson who does a great job as something close to an emotionless robot.

You don't find that much these days, even with a lot of the so called independent films that are being made. A lot of viewers will find this film either boring, incomprehensible or just weird. I personally would not compare it to Eraserhead like other reviewers have done. I have never seen anything quite like this movie. It reminded me somewhat of the more avant-garde films that were made in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Films where the cinematography was foremost, and the director was striving for a specific atmosphere and mood. I purposely did not read a lot about the plot or the main character before watching the film. I found myself enjoying the process of figuring out who and what she was, and why she was doing what she was doing. If you are going to try watching this simply because its Scarlett Johansson, skip it. Its not for you. If you like your movies straightforward, with no challenge to how you see the world, skip this film. If you are interested in viewing something done with artistry and originality, then give it a try. You might just like it.",1445904000,,1217,4.561643835616438
6310646,5,B00J22YU62,"I'm going to make this quick because I'm so excited to start reading other reviews. I want to know what other people's theories are as to what was really going on and why. It's that kind of movie; I want to watch it again and I want to talk about it, and I want to learn more about it. I'm going to assume that the prospect of seeing Scarlett Johansson naked probably drove a lot of people to (attempt to) watch this movie who ordinarily would not, and that's why there are so many 1-star reviews. Frankly, if you want to watch a movie where the characters literally explain everything to you and there is a tidy little ending that resolves everything, then you generally have your pick of movies every single weekend, and you will be very disappointed by this movie.

My review: It didn't make me cry or laugh, which in a way I appreciate that my emotions weren't being so obviously manipulated as so many movies do. This movie was fascinating, disturbing and poignant. Nothing is explained to the viewer and there is not a neat resolution. There is an unhurried pace, there are stretches of silence, similar to Moon or 2001 A Space Odyssey. And similar to those movies, some people are going to think this is boring, and some people are going to use the stretches of silence or inaction to try and process what the heck is going on and anticipate the next revelation. I appreciated the lack of dialogue--the actors in this movie are actually acting instead of telling the viewer the story. There were a couple of points where I asked myself, ""What the f___ am I watching? Why am I watching this?"" But I felt compelled to keep watching, and I'm glad that I did, and of course those moments were vital to the impact of the movie. Scarlett Johansson was really good in this movie, it's amazing such a beautiful and vital woman could make herself look and seem so dead-eyed and creepy as hell, I mean she really gave me the creeps in some scenes.

***SPOILERS BELOW***

I have my own theories about what was going on and why. I'll call the aliens Scarlett and Biker.

The nature of the aliens is at least partially revealed in one of the first scenes, when Scarlett examines an ant she found crawling on the belly of their first victim. Scarlett and the Biker are like ants, searching for food and bringing it back to the queen, and similar to ants, have no emotion or empathy. There is a theory that Scarlett's body was stolen, that the alien possessed or filled the skin of a human woman, but I think not. If they only needed to find a victim for Scarlett to possess, that victim most likely would have had clothes on, so there would have been no need for a naked Scarlett to steal the clothes of yet another victim and hope that they fit. (Also, it would have been ripped or torn or something?) So, the alien formed the Scarlett skin over its body, and already knew enough about humanity to understand what features would make a woman attractive. However, she was only given the features required to lure victims to the giant vat of fluid (I don't know if it's actually a vat). She discovered this later, when she tried to have intercourse with a man: he seemed to be having some difficulty, and when she realized this, she felt herself down there, pushed him away, grabbed a lamp and looked between her legs to examine it. I'm 100% sure there was nothing down there. After all, genitalia is fairly complicated, and she didn't actually need any to do her job.

I plan to watch it again, because I'm not sure what I think that liquid is, or why Scarlet eventually rejected her mission and fled from her fellow alien.",1445817600,,3616,4.464447806354009

I know the lack of dialogue is supposed to add to the atmospherics, still, a little more exposition would really have helped.  The only image that is likely to stick with anyone is full frontal Scarlett, bless her.  She actually does very little here, given she's in most every scene.  Her driving around in a van gets pretty boring pretty quickly and other than the alien(s?)'s ability to inhabit human skin and shed it at will it never seems like they have any sort of motivation or even menace.

She is obviously exploring much more interesting and provocative material and accepting roles which are very ""different"" than what we are used to from her. Lastly, I think it is so much better than the almost moronic ""Lucy"", where the audience is patronized ad infinitum. Do we really need Morgan Freeman to dumb everything down to see what is going on? Worst of all, she downloads (?) all of her knowledge into a usb memory stick!? That is like trying to drain the Atlantic ocean through a smalllll/kitchen funnel.

6310720,5,B00J22YU62,"Have you ever felt like an outcast? Like you didn't belong? Like something was different about you? Director Jonathan Glazer takes that idea to its logical extreme.

Under the Skin is a movie about the unique horror of isolation you can only experience in a city. There are no shortage of people, kind words, or charitable deeds, and yet every attempt at connection simply points out its impossibility. The tension in this movie is slow, continuous, and simmering. The barrier between the unknown woman and everyone else is slowly and steadily pressed to the point of breaking. It's like watching a car crash over two hours: slow, horrific, and fascinating.

Not everyone who watches Under the Skin will see a movie. Most of the footage is shot in hidden cameras with the main character having seemingly normal interactions with real people for much of the film. It doesn't try to simplify its message, and it doesn't have patience for anyone who cannot appreciate its subtlety. As a film and a film experiment Under the Skin is more than original: it is truly alien.",1444348800,,1067,4.825136612021858

Instead, the viewer is left to their own conclusion. Some of the victims don't fit the traditional mold; indeed, some of them are almost unimaginable in this type of film - though I wander a bit, because this film is of its own type.  The cinematography is gritty to an extent that it nearly belies the film's high production values.

Very cinematic approach with a refreshing lack of dialogue--telling the story of a dark alien being nourishing itself while living in Scotland. In my opinion, what is not seen explicitly is just as important as what is show in this film. Much of the film is dark and clinical, allowing your imagination to fill in the gaps left by limited exposition.

But their is no driving force to the plot, it meanders for over and hour, until suddenly there is a shift in direction - not because of any instigating event in the film, but seemingly because of the point in the runtime that had been reached.

Johansson is very good, but to no particular end. An interesting portrayal of a non-character is not very compelling, any more than beautiful cinematography with no purpose is.

The film is so far up its own ass that it never bothers to even hint at what is going on. I'm not talking about spelling things out for a dumb audience, I'm talking about sitting and watching basically nothing until the ending, which also, simply happens, and then is over. Everything that I know about what is actually going on comes from outside sources, not from the film itself, and that is a big no-no.

6310753,3,B00J22YU62,"Jonathan Glazers Under the Skin is a kind of film that challenges the viewer to see things differently. Thats a good thing, and the premise is intriguing. Its about the human world (in this case Scotland) seen from a predatory life form disguised as a young woman played by Scarlett Johansson.

The films sparse narrative and measured pace is far from that of Hollywood sci-fi movies like Species. No scientists show up to explain the mysterious womans motive for capturing men. Johanssons character, whoever it is, seems to undergo a certain psychological change at a certain point, but we are not really sure when and how this happens. And these are not bad things.

Even so, and despite some brilliant images and eerie soundtrack that may draw comparison with more famous film directors like Kubrick, Under the Skin is drawn out to the point of being pretentious and self-indulgent. Even those who think the film is unique and inventive would agree that it takes too much time trying to make its point.

Under the Skin strives to be unconventional at the risk of alienating viewers. I respect the decision, but also think that, slow-moving as it is, 2001: A Space Odyssey offers enough mystery and suspense, and most importantly, is not boring.",1444003200,,1247,4.872641509433962

6310756,3,B00J22YU62,"Meh.  Good if you want to see Scarlett Johansson emotionless and naked, but quite frankly a Google search of ""naked scarlet"" would probably yield quicker, more satisfactory results.  I didn't read the book.  I was excited to watch this after seeing it on a ""Greatest intellectual films of all times"" list.  I didn't feel like this movie was intellectual.  I watch a lot of foreign film.  I went to art school.  Some favorite modern directors are Lars Von Trier, Greenaway, Herzog, Morris, Noe. There are some beautiful cinematographic shots in this film, mostly of nature.  Looking back in my mind's eye, these shots, like Johansson's character, seem like shells of beauty without really saying much.  I suppose one could treat the film like viewing a lot of modern art: reading and creating meaning that may be there--but more often times is not.  We could look at the landscapes as breathing, living and emotionless, feeding on nutrients unseen below the surface--more beautiful than the analogous aliens crisscrossing the terrain on motos.  But now I feel like I have already given this film more thought than it is worth.

This movie was much like the plot line:  A shell with ambiguous intentions, driving around aimlessly giving occasional glimpses of beauty to the beholder when it stopped and rolled down the window.  In the end, one is left with that feeling that time marches on and it is all pretty senseless.

Underscore ""pretty senseless"", if you want to make this film seem more intellectual than it is.",1443830400,,1517,4.917322834645669

When Scarlett walks down a road to a bus stop... there are no cuts we just watch her walk and walk and walk and walk and walk - and suddenly a 10 second dialogue. And this is just one example.
The underlying sci-fi story is not all new but it is there.
Scarlett is enjoyable - the lightning and make-up crew must have hated her though because they don't really put on a nice light.
There are scenes that are ""frappant"" and shake you up a bit - not horror or violence but e.g. there are scenes with a complete lack of empathy and encounters with decent but unfortunate people.

6310760,4,B00J22YU62,"In the film Under the Skin there is no story line or development of character(as in the book), the almost non-existent story must be created from what we see. Johansson plays a blank,humanoid void of personality, filling in (like us) the blanks of what she knows with what she sees. The stroke of genius was dropping an A-list star into the streets of Glasgow and her mixing with non actors using a Kiarostami-type -10 approach to filming in and from the white van, with all the sounds of the street filtering through. I wonder how much this film traded on Scarlet Johanssons celebrity glamour rather than her acting skills as she seems like a passive observer, almost mute, apart from a few encounters with stranger pick-ups on the streets, where the recognisable husky voice and seductive tone reels another unsuspecting victim into her lair. There are some brilliant,stunning visual effects, making the film realize the the alien presence with the eye image from the spherical globe, to the birth of her human identity in the all-white space, where she dons the victims clothes and identity. The heroine knows how to drive a car and turn a sentence, and the use of red lip-stick as she kerb crawls.

The chipper lad, the cocksure charmer, the deformed lonely hearts are all lured in by this femme fatale, siren of film noir luring them( friendless) into the cavern of blackness of her squat. The victims wade into a black intergalactic gloo as she walks on enticingly above.
A mystery biker speeding the Scottish highways seems to aid and abet her, or monitor and supervise her. Is he her controller or is he her drone? All is accompanied by Mica Levis eerie ominous drums and strings soundtrack. We don't know who she is, she doesnt even have a name. She has a mission, some of which she may not know herself. She even kills one victim with a rock when hes washed up on a beach trying to save two people in the sea. Im not sure how much we are supposed to project onto her opaque performance glimmerings of
consciousness, e. g. when she picks up a man at night suffering from facial disfigurement, whose loneliness and longing appear to affect her and she lets him live, then after she takes off for the Scottish highlands, her growing human awareness and vulnerability allows her to
experience briefly a relationship and sex which shocks her. She is seen to explore her naked body, to wonder about its effects in a mirror. The ending is both matter-of-fact and tragic.

Glazer made it clear on this project of 9 years, he didn't want to make the novel, but make a film on what it means to feel human. The clever ploy is using the alien gaze to show us our own alienness back to us. How alien we would seem to an alien as how strange an alien would be to us in any encounter. Hes on slippery ground. We cannot gainsay the beauty of non-verbal images, but this has no substance without a narrative thread. As a former director of music videos and TV commercials there is a slickness, he creates atmosphere and mood, but lacking dialogue or narrative, what does happen has a certain repetition and tedium, blankness and incomprehension, emptied as the story is of its intellectual content  and relevant details. Still its Johanssons best yet. A very anti- Scarlett performance where she takes risks.",1443744000,2,3301,4.668384879725086

One is forced to accept the unknowable. The primary twist of the antagonist's eventual experiments trying to experience the human condition is well played, again deepening the sense of her unknowable inner life and blurring some assumptions as an observer just enough.

I found myself thinking about the possible metaphors that the story could be bringing in regard to human social psychology as it relates to attraction and repulsion.

The antagonist is well-cast and made the drama extremely effective. Ms. Johanson went out on a limb in my opinion and succeeded mightily. Props to her and everyone involved.

Wish I could give it a zero.

But this is simply someone thinking they are artistic by being vague and random. How they managed to cast Scarlett Johansson is beyond me.
This movie could have been truncated down to a 10 minute short story and it would still be horrible, make no sense, and really just be an excuse to catch some of johansson's body double nip.

I suspect that the book was much better and contained substantial narratives and characterizations. But the movie has none of this, and is all the worse for it. The movie adaptation of the plot is obscure and unfocused, the character relationships are disjointed and rarely given either substance or meaning, and there is neither drama, suspense, nor passion in the story telling. If I hadn't looked for, and found, a description of the book's plot I'd have never figured out from the movie what this woman was or who any of the characters were meant to represent ... at least, I don't think so. It's glacial pace and lack of cohesion reminded me in some ways of an old foreign language adaption I saw of The Metamorphosis, but without any of the attempt at profundity. I can't for the life of me understand why ScarJo agreed to make such a terrible movie, except that perhaps she thought an art-houe'esque role might be a diverting change from the work she is usually sought for. Whatever the reason, she carries the movie and most, if not all, of the intrigue comes from how surreal it is to see _her_ in such a weird and misshapen production. If you're a ScarJo fan and just positively have to see everything she does, then by all means watch this movie ... otherwise, find something else to watch, or do, because this is a total waste of two hours you'll never get back in your life.",1442016000,,1487,4.5315985130111525

Actually be willing to think about the sort of human existential exploration the film makers are making, don't worry so much about the un-shown motives of the alien being's actions, but rather piece that together however you like, and you will finish this feeling rewarded.

The important thing is to understand the questions about our collective human existence and in our individual lives that the filmmakers are trying to provoke; understanding what the aliens are doing isn't important. Under the Skin feels poetic and exciting if you're thinking.

There are two things left to do when watching: take in the ominous tone and visually interesting and gorgeous scenes, and clear your head of all the existential analysis & confusion on what the aliens are trying to do for a moment to appreciate each time you get to see one of the most beautiful, iconic cultural figures of our time in the nude.

I have been pretty infatuated with Scarlett since I was a 17 year old boy in 2002, and this movie is so stimulating that some of the scenes of her nude almost snuck by me without my realizing what I was actually seeing. She is truly a beautiful young woman, and it's a beautiful thing that she was generous enough to share her body with the world. 30 years down the road, my son can admire her beauty at age 29 if he wishes.

She lures them back to her many lairs thru out the city,portal to another dimension, where they are sucked into a black hole, held, an awaiting an ominous death. We find that they are processed into food for her planet. Wandering the streets, she takes a tumble which seems to allow her more humane attributes such as compassion and  seems to go on a search of discovering herself in human form.  Many interesting scenes follow and I shan't reveal the ending. This movie is not for everyone, and I'm not sure if it helps if you have read the book since it follows it very loosely.

This was only worsened by the fact it is such a dark movie.  By that I don't mean dark tone but actually dark as if they couldn't afford any lighting.

I really enjoyed that it exposed only enough to give the viewer something to think about but not so little that you loose interest. I found myself wondering about aspects of it days later.

The scenes in the liquid substance were disturbing and the sounds were perfect to really create a haunting sequence it took me a while to forget. The only real criticism I had was that at some points it was hard to understand the accents and dialog. I almost wanted to turn on the closed captioning but there was so little of it that it wasn't worth it really.

6310973,4,B00J22YU62,"From the outset I knew this would be a strange film because of reviews that led me to renting it. I liked it for the biggest reason; it didn't hit me over the head with bloody violence and a backstory cribbed from every horror movie ever filmed. Not even being sure of what I saw I realize that may be the point. I'm supposed to fill in the blanks and that's fine, in fact I like a film that leaves me guessing. There's nothing explained. For many that's not the narrative they require. It's not a film for everybody, but maybe it should be, at least every once in awhile. Maybe we need less spoon fed plots and story twists -that we catch to make ourselves feel clever- and watch something for the sake of watching it and savoring every nuanced bit of information, or new mystery we can get.
The one thing I liked about this film is the alienation of the viewer. This is not a character who will win anyone over. But then something changes, and while I didn't become what would be described as sympathetic, I did start to wonder, to care. I'm not even sure that I was supposed to.
Scarlett Johansen is one of my favorite actors to watch and this adds to her film repertoire in a daring way.
I think the oddest thing for me was how oddly human her ""alien"" is. While she's in complete control she was oddly vulnerable and also detached. How does an actor pull that off so effectively?
The other high point of the film are the people and the settings. There wasn't an actor in the lot. Everyone felt real and not in the least bit contrived. The director ran a risk with that because people can be dull and they are especially daffy around attractive, seemingly vulnerable women.
The settings from urban and rural Scotland were the perfect backdrop for such a weird tale. Everything seemed so normal and dreary but also could be seen haunting and desolate. Visiting Scotland for the first time in '03 helped.
I'm glad I took the risk on this movie.
Perhaps I'll read the book.",1439942400,2,1973,4.39344262295082

6310980,1,B00J22YU62,"Well, I gave it a whirl, hoping that the positive reviewers were the smart ones. Nope. The story is actually brain-dead simple. An alien disguised as a hot babe is luring men to some kind of doom, undetermined. She leads them into this black, tarry stuff, which does some weird things to them, which we don't understand. About an hour into the film, she starts to get interested in mankind. The alien who's managing her, some guy who rides around on a motorcycle and cleans up the jobs she's muffed, isn't happy. But just about the time you think there's going to be a conflict between the babe and her boss, some woodsman shows the bad side of humanity by trying to rape her. Then he douses her with gasoline and burns her to a crisp. End of film.

Given that the idea is so lame, the only explanation for anyone finding any merit in the film, is the unexpected treatment. There is almost no dialogue, the pace is glacial, and the strategy is always to keep the viewer confused. So it seems mysterious and outr. The signature scene is in a restaurant. The babe has ordered a piece of chocolate cake, presumably because she knows humans like chocolate and she wants to give it a try. But you don't see her order it. It just arrives, and we watch for two minutes while she cuts a piece with her fork and carries it to her mouth. Finally, she spits the cake out, presumably because aliens can't digest chocolate or cake or both. This is a lame scene by any standard, but the filmmakers have made it mysterious by keeping us guessing what's going on. We don't see the babe order the cake, and we don't know what her motivation is. We just see her sitting at the table, and then the cake arrives. Then, we don't see her face. All we see is two minutes of the fork cutting the cake--very, very slowly--and then the fork carries the piece of cake to the babe's mouth--very, very slowly. Then she spits it out. What would be a horribly stupid scene is turned into something that seems less stupid, because we don't have a clue what's going until the scene is over.

There is a scene that should be funny. The babe gets sufficiently interested in mankind to give love a whirl, so she has sex with a guy. But when it comes time for penetration, she's aghast and holds a lamp to her groin to try and figure out what's going on. Should be funny, but unfortunately it, too, is lame. We've seen her using her sexual wiles to lure single man to her pad where the two of them strip naked. She destroys them before sex is possible, but there is no way she doesn't understand what human intercourse is. So her surprise at the mechanics of the love act isn't credible.

Dummies may hate this film, but it's not for smart folks. Don't bother.",1439942400,,2723,4.377470355731226

6310994,4,B00J22YU62,"This movie is beautifully filmed enveloping the viewer in  a cold, wet, Scotland of stunning wind whipped seascapes and mesmerizing, swaying forest tops, empty country vistas and cold grey townscapes populated by anonymous people and quotidian events. The raw natural beauty and the casual human activity all rendered remote and somehow ominous to the movie viewer as it is all seen thru the eyes of the main character, played terrifically with almost no dialogue by Scarlett Johansson. The trick if the film is that we don't know who, or finally, what, Ms. Johansson is. And we don't really know what her purpose is as she endlessly drives around looking to pickup lonely men who apparently are without connections to other people. She then seduces them into going home with her where they become transfixed by her and are lead into an unearthly, other place, where they sink into a frightening, floating nothingness. To what end we never learn. I have seen the movie twice and there are still things I simply don't understand. They don't matter. The basic premise becomes clear early on. Inevitably, the main character gets fouled up in various situations from the (almost) funny to the more often sad and tragic. A disturbing anomie is created as we watch these events unfold through the uncomprehending person of a near mute Ms Johansson.

Certainly this is a rather minimalist art film and I'm sorry to say lost much of its emotional slam when seen on a TV screen. But on the big screen it is engaging, visually stunning and emotionally powerful. I left the theater feeling a bit like an alien myself.",1439596800,,1606,4.857664233576642

6311024,3,B00J22YU62,"Note that  this is based on a book that I haven't read, so I can' only critique the film based on the film itself.

The good - the photography and acting is well done.

The not-so-good - the pacing is slow, the characters are almost completely opaque, and it is very difficult to engage or remain engaged in the story.

SPOILER ALERT:

The overall - S.F. all too often strays into familiar, shallow waters, which means the whole alien-on-Earth-harvesting plotline has been done practically to death, so it's hard to plow new and interesting territory. What I like is the ambition to attempt it and this movie does so by making the man character, unnamed, a true mystery. She is an alien seductress, which means she can use her beauty and feminine wiles, drive a car, talk to people coherently and has obviously rented or taken over a location where she brings her victims for... well, I'll get to that in a moment.

Now the problem with an alien seductress is about how she's able to know people well enough to be effective at it. She is, first and foremost, Scarlett Johansson, so she obviously is beautiful and sensuous. But she doesn't seem very ""smooth"" in her approach - which makes sense if you're an alien, but an alien who apparently knows on some level about modern society. It's a fine line and I don't know how well it is pulled off. Then there is the issue of the black goo. The victims are taken to some house or apartment, convinced to undress and then simply walk down a hall into black goo where they are submerged and essentially are eaten from the inside out. First of all, didn't they notice what they were stepping in or were they already enslaved or unable to notice? We never learn. Then there is the people dissolving inside out. Does she need to feed like a spider (which would be a nice metaphor and fits into her role) or is it for some greater purpose. Again, we never learn. My problem is that, if it is only to feed, then it seems like too much trouble for her to go through. If it is for a greater purpose, it just doesn't have nearly enough to explain this process. It makes me wonder if this is all or at least more fully explained in the book I never read (and probably wont.)

There is some depth to her seductress character as shown when she picks up a man apparently suffering from the ""Elephant Man"" syndrome - she first seduces this lonely man and then releases him. Nice. So there is either a quality of mercy or, at the least, he's not good enough to consume factor. I would have loved to have seen at least one man who got in the vehicle with her, sensed she was ""weird"" and gotten out; but alas, anyone in her vehicle is doomed (unless they suffer from hideous disfigurement).

Also, there is an ally she uses and we never learn if he is a fellow alien or someone she has seduced. I'm thinking it's more of the former, but he seems to simply come in and out of the movie, as it only a naked plot contrivance.

And the ending... it made me grit my teeth to see the seeming irony of a would-be rapist saving the human race...

So, would I recommend this film. Conditionally.

If you want a different take on a familiar subgenre of S.F. that is well-filmed and well-acted, and that is enough, then see this movie.

If, however, you are annoyed when there is no relatable character (except maybe the victims), slow pacing and some rather significant WTF factors, then this is not the film to see.",1439164800,6,3434,4.399053627760252

6311068,5,B00J22YU62,"Certainly not your usual big budget, CGI, sci-fi movie. I have always looked for these little gems of purity. Seems like one of those stories hidden in often ignored, old, science fiction magazines and books from the '50's. I snatch those Time Machine compilations off the shelves for 50 cents and usually make a bunch of giddy groans like E.T. made after finding one Reese's Pieces after another. Yellowed pages but under that type of skin, they are stories that draw you in with crumbs that have recently travelled through the Universe; through the Pillars of Creation, past that puppy planet Pluto, the blue worlds of Uranus and Neptune, ricocheting off all the rings of Saturn, passing through the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, pinging off a Mars Rover and finally floating down to my moss-laden shack in NH. Not much I want to tell anyone other than it's not too long before you have a pretty good idea what going on and it's into the Wormhole after that. While there's no doubt part of the attraction is Scarlett Johansson, her beauty is only skin deep--and nothing else; no matter what your eyes see in that mirror. She maintains a porcelain doll personna through most of the movie until those ""You're not in Kansas anymore"" feelings come as quite a shock as the tables are turned on her! She gets quite a dose of living among Humans and it's not all it's cranked up to be or what the mission priority had been. ""Under the Skin"" has some pretty good ""twists"" and that's the five stars. See it HD because the countryside is beautiful but there's pretty horrific things going on in soggy Scotland. Scarlett is a favorite of mine because she takes chances. She's young and has completely embraced her career as an actress. Where will she go next? She does have that ultimate aura of self-confidence that allows her to get lost in some roles. It makes her an interesting person and a delightfully disarming performer. It makes you wonder--- if you could look deeply into her eyes--would ""Lucy"" be staring back at you?",1438214400,5,2017,4.668539325842697

6311088,4,B00J22YU62,"As mesmerizing as it is perplexing, Under the Skin can be, alternately, a tease, a head-scratching bore, and a feast for the eyes and mind.
It is purposefully obtuse, speaking in broad artistic strokes rather than dialogue (which is scant, and in the cast of the Scottish men, almost impossible to understand). Scarlett Johansson is an alien roaming a Scottish city; she (it?) apparently needs to lure men into an abandoned suburban lair outfitted with what seems to be a dark and oozing pool of viscous fluid that her suitors willingly walk into as if in a trance (underscored by Mica Levis sparse, strangely alluring seduction music). Ensnared in some womb-like funk, they are even able to make contact with fellow suitors until some unseen machinery violently sucks everything from them but their skin, left to float in the water like a dermal jellyfish. Then shes back in her white van, prowling the streets and clubs. Though she appears as a sexy siren who knows how to converse with men, and how to finesse their instinct for protection and lust, Johansson makes it clear that this alien is a stranger in a strange land. We do not get any explanation of her origin (or her motorcycle-riding accomplice), or how she came to know so well the human psychology necessary for her ruse. It must suffice that she wears the skin of a vivacious and sexy female.

Director Jonathan Glazer (Sexy Beast, Birth) does not make every male victim a drooling simpleton. Some of the men she encounters are sincere, some are simply driven by lust, and one in particular, a horribly disfigured man she tempts with simple kindness, is compelled by the attention of this beautiful woman not recoiling in horror. This man spurs a change in her; she lets him go, and becomes lost in a search for her own identity within her borrowed skin. Wandering in the cold Scottish countryside while her cohort searches for her, she is taken in by a well-meaning man in a small village. His kindness and a desired to explore human compassion lead her to the jarring discovery of what isn't under her skin.

Casting Johansson was an interesting choice; she does several scenes in the nude, and Glazer is careful to light her in shadow and tint so as not to overwhelm the viewer with a holy cow, ScarJo is naked reaction. There is no beauty or glamour to her being (for half the film she seems as sexy but mentally lost as Isabella Rossellinis torch-singer in Blue Velvet). It is a one-note performance on the surface, but Johansson provides deeper resonance. When the true alien form emerges, it is sleek and surprising.

The scenes where she is stalking her victims are done in a gritty, guerilla-filmmaker style which is a stark contrast with the beautiful and meditative scenes of the hillsides, forests, the towns at night, and the most horrifying scene of all; when she is trying to lure a man at a beach, the man bolts off to rescue a husband and wife who swam out to get their dog, struggling with the current. After a losing battle, he comes back to shore and she kills him and drags him off, completely ignoring the heartbreaking wails of the couples infant, sitting on shore as the tide steadily comes in around him.

There is an ending that may seem terribly anticlimactic, but perfectly in tone with the somber mood on display. The dense mix of lush imagery with blunted human pathos is evocative of Terrence Mallicks films. Its one of the most interesting films and performances of the year. Under the Skin is an exercise in patience which passes no judgment and offers no moral compass, but it is a fascinating ride.

6311120,3,B00J22YU62,"Now comes Scarlett Johansson in the role of an alien inspecting us earth folk in Under the Skin.  Funny how you can have a bigger budget, a much longer project, a whole novel for the source material, a big-name like Johansson, and not even come close to being as interesting as Ex Machina which I also just viewed.

Of course Johansson is not playing an artificial intelligence; she is playing an actual alien who has taken on the appearance of a human in order to study us.  Still there are some similarities: contemplating meeting some intelligence equal to or superior to our own, and yet very different.

People find this film frustrating.  I found it frustrating.  No, its not just because I have to have everything spelled out for me.  [And YES, a lot of stuff IS NOT spelled out in the film, which apparently did annoy a lot of viewers].  Enemy, which I recently reviewed, also left out a lot of explanation and yet I found it thoroughly engaging.  In this one though, theres a one-two sucker punch, because as it begins you don't understand what you're seeing.  Then you're seeing Johansson driving around watching people [and yes, abducting some of them, even if she doesnt have a UFO hovering in the sky to take them into and anal-probe them] but...NOTHING MUCH SEEMS TO HAPPEN for a good one-third of the movie.  It goes from baffling to boring, and stays that way methinks, for too long.

The specials on the blu-ray are rather sparse and I had hoped theyd shed more light on the background for the script, but one thing did come through loud & clear.  In the end they decided the most interesting way to do the movie was simply to give us almost the aliens viewpoint.  We are watching humanity like some new species weve never seen before.  Mostly this was filmed in Scotland, which leads to interesting contrasts: a modern mall; old Scottish houses; snow-covered mountains, and forests.  For most of the urban scenes they did NOT populate them with extras; they had normal mall-shoppers, disco-dancers etc. on the sets, and did the filming in the most discreet way possible, trying to get a genuine and spontaneous feel for the city scenes.

Well, unless it was a stunt double, Johansson does bare herself more in this film than Ive seen in any of her priors [not that Ive watched them all].  Youd better enjoy watching her [with or without her clothes], because her script practically could have fit on one page.

I had hoped for something a little more exciting.  Possibly more scary, or at the least more challenging.  This is a slow-paced film; be forewarned.  Enter with that expectation [and not expecting any explanations] and maybe you'll like it better.",1437177600,,2676,4.697424892703863

Perfect soundtrack.
One of the few movies that needs to be seen at least twice and keeps you thinking and feeling about it for days.

The movie communicates the rawness and basic aspect of life.
All life is motivated by survival.
Survival by consuming more life, deception, force or reproducing.

Movie also narrates what might happen when an organism becomes aware of its individuality and becomes deprogrammed.
Interesting to see that only the lower classes where the victims without any consequence to the system.
Reminded me of how ants societies work.

6311139,5,B00J22YU62,"I give grade 4.5 rounding up as 5. Why? This is difficult movie to understand and appreciate. This is a very sophisticated, subtle, artistic, great  SF-Horror movie. People who gave low grade must have been blind to this super-subtle sensitive movie development. I did not know the book or story behind this movie. To understand fairly, I have to watch carefully up to the end. At the ending, we know beautiful woman was exactly alien predator sucking life-force from the lonely male victims. I thought of other SF movie ""Lifeforce"" (1985) by author Colin Wilson (Title ""Space Vampire"") in which beautiful naked alien (played by Mathilda May) sucked life force from victims, but this movie was visible from start that beautiful naked woman was alien. In this ""Under the Skin"", it was not so obvious. Maybe Title of movie was suggestive, I think,  after watching this movie. ""Lifeforce"" was more entertaining movie, while ""Under the Skin"" was serious study of visitors (creatures, predators) from space mixing with earth people. The scene at street (woman fallen down and stayed for a while and showed ""no-thank you - I don't care"" attitude after the scene) was shown as very indicative of alien nature in artistic way. This is the first time I watched Scarlett Johansson. And she truly played important role as alien predator pretending beautiful woman on earth. Very artistic, highbrow, great movie. But it is truly difficult movie to understand and appreciate. Movie must be easily understandable to be enjoyed fully. This is the reason of my grade 4.5 instead of simple 5. Mathilda May in Lifeforce was beautiful and so this Scarlett Johansson was also beautiful in nude and played truly subtle, important role. I have to watch again to enjoy thoroughly of this sophisticated, well-crafted SF-Horror movie. Great! I am glad to know there are somebody who can still produce beautiful horror movie without much artificial noise.",1437004800,,1929,5.043887147335423

The movie had me completely confused at first, but I liked that. I don't want to be able to decipher a movie's intentions by the time the opening credits end, and this one kept me guessing. It's strange, disturbing and captivating. I won't describe it since other people have done of good job of doing so already, but if you like to be engaged by a movie rather than blithely and blandly entertained, give this movie a look. Movies are, or at least can be an artistic expression and a creative exploration of uncommon themes.

If you have any interest in seeing all the details of Scarlett's NUDE BODY it's worth watching just for that... There must be about 3 full minutes of it shot from nearly every angle in various scenes strewn throughout the whole movie. If you have any interest in contemporary SCOTLAND and it's ordinary working-class people (and their males' nude bodies) it might be worth watching just for that. It's kind of a ""Scottish Twilight Zone episode"" and would have been better as an hour-long TV show. It's very slow and creepy and too repetitive but the boring repetitiveness has a lot to do with why Scarlett's interplanetary-hunter character slowly becomes interested in the subtleties of her Earthling prey. Really, if you're working on a project... have it on and savor the few good bits. The scene near the end with the dwarfish guy in the van is touching.",1436745600,,957,4.771084337349397

Through the eyes of Scarlett, it presents a detached and clinical view of humans through individual encounters. The film showcasing man's impulses and potential for good and evil, though through a very intimate and anecdotal way. Some really interesting discussion can be brought up when dissecting the film, but with the filmmaker's style and perspective taken away, it's as simple as the synopsis seems. While the plot occasionally loses momentum, everything in the film feels very deliberate, and exudes a confidence from the filmmakers in presenting the story through Scarlett's eyes. The film is an excellent showcase of how atmosphere and design can elevate a story to an entirely new level, and put the viewer in an original mindset. A haunting and repetitive score perfectly complements Under the Skin's warped imagery, leaving a lasting impression regardless of one's thoughts on the plot. While I feel a lot of the film's proponents are overrating it due to its originality and immediacy, I can't deny that 'Under the Skin' is a tentpole of atmospheric storytelling, and will leave an impression for months to come.

If you prefer clear narratives with no loose ends and everything neatly tied up, or if you want a nonstop action pace, this isn't a movie for you and you shouldn't bother rating it.  If you enjoy movies that set out to disorient and trouble you and that are filled with images designed to work on you long after the film is over, then this is probably a movie you will find worth viewing.  I think it's a masterpiece of dread and the uncanny, and I've been thinking about it (and rewatching portions of it) ever since I saw it two weeks ago.  It is truly a work of art, and a work of genius.  Like Beethoven's Grosse Fuge, it's not going to conform to a standard template, it's not going to be easy, and it's going to leave you shaken up and exalted.  At another time, I think more people would have wanted to put in some work to engage a movie like this, but now it seems that a lot of people actively resent being challenged.  If you relish a challenge, this movie will pay off for you, big time.",1435622400,4,1415,4.1501831501831505

Unless one is a knuckle-dragger then watching this movie entirely to the end is a minimum of cerebral cortex synapse or perhaps you're like the scarecrow in Oz (looking for any signs that one is not brain dead).

But all of that minutia aside, this is the sort of film that you dream about seeing if you love the idea of subtle, artistic science fiction that burns slowly.

There is very little dialogue (in some ways it's like watching a silent movie with the dialogue cards done in audio) and that means the actors, principally Johansson, have to emote, and boy does she ever emote.  Of course she's aided in this by some pretty amazing photography, a pine forest rippling in strong winds, fog being whipped up, a stark landscape being momentarily traversed by a very tiny motorcycle, urban scenes that glow like Christmas decorations...and so forth.  Just beautiful.

Read any review on any website and it becomes clear that either people love or hate the film. Not a lot of middle ground exists on this one and thats not surprising given the style and execution.

Note: I feel compelled to address anyone who is only interested in seeing Scarlett Johansson fully nude (because you totally do!). Find the pictures or gifs online, don't waste time watching the whole movie. If all you're after is quick thrill the story/theme/concept will pass right by you, then youll feel compelled to write a s***ty review based on nothing and who wants to read that.

I digress. Movie review. Focus Ok, the movie is

In a word disturbing. More disturbing than this one. The film is disturbing for several reasons. First, the idea is altogether creepy if you're a guy who likes to cruise bars and pick up women. Second, there is a scene on a beach that is nearly unwatchable if you have small kids and/or a dog. Its necessary to the theme and it works. Oh god does it work. Just be warned.

The scenes in the van were shot with hidden cam, the men being picked up aren't actors. I know crazy right, but it makes the scenes more believable. The cinematography is amazing, and relevant so pay attention.

Q: What is the story about?
A: Predator vs Prey. Humanity. Empathy. Stuff like that.

Q: Do you get to see ScarJo nude?
A: Please see my note above.

Q: Is it a good film?
A: Its a well made film that is very thought provoking. Youll either get it or you wont, but either way I don't see this being re-watched on a regular basis.

Q: How about children. Can I let my kids watch this film?
A: I wouldnt, and I generally don't have an issue with kids watching most horror movies. I started with Dawn of the Dead at six years old and I turned out o.k. I think. No, this movie not only has a lot of nudity but some of the scenes are very disturbing, and very realistic. Keep the kids away.",1433894400,,2034,4.374005305039788

I'm aware I am watching the production put together by  A team of passionate people who want to put out something original, or exciting, new, or any combination thereof.

It's rare that I lose myself while watching the film, getting lost in the story. I'm usually focused on camera, lighting, sound, performance, production design,  as well as story  how it's told, doesn't follow a 3 act structure or something less conventional, does the story challenge me, etc?

I believe the reason I like this film is because it's perfect for someone like me who wants to be challenged. Someone who wants to be challenged by how a story can be told both by the  script, production and performances.  This film successfully challenges you on all of these aspects.

I completely understand how many filmgoers go to escape reality. They want to forget about things and just enjoy a movie. I totally get that, I want to go back to being able to forget myself and just enjoy the film. But if you don't think that way, I can't imagine you'll enjoy this movie.

And that is saying nothing negative about the film itself or the viewer who does not care for the movie.  Hardly anything or anyone in this world can appeal to everyone at the same time and film is no exception.

If you want to put something on that you can relax too, forget about the world and just enjoy being told a story, this movie is not for you. If you are someone who wants to be challenged through filmmaking which doesn't hide it's attempts at presenting itself as a storytelling artform, I think you will enjoy this film.",1433808000,,1830,4.413690476190476

6311342,3,B00J22YU62,"On my initial viewing, I found the movie to be just on the border of incomprehensible. So I was surprised when I noticed after watching it that it had gotten a rating in the 80% range from Rotten Tomatoes. It turns out that you had to be familiar with the book on which the movie is based to really understand it, since it contained a lot of critical expository information that the movie lacked.  Once I had that information and was able to reevaluate the movie in that context, I was able to bring it up from my initial assessment of 1 star to 3.

ScarJo was pretty good in the movie.  She was little more than a cipher during the first half of the movie, but a later encounter had a profound effect on her,  helping her develop some empathy with the men who would be her victims. Her performance during the transition was compelling, some of the best work that I've seen from her. If you wish to see this movie, I'd recommend reading just enough of a couple of reviews to just find out the nature of her mission. It'll save you the exasperation of watching this movie and spending the entire time trying to figure out what she and her accomplice are doing.",1433721600,,1159,4.3271889400921655

I am impressed with Ms. Johansson's performance in that she is very expressive facially and has few if no lines that are spoken out loud and yet conveys her emotions and intent very directly.
I just wished there was more specifics in the movie than they gave.

6311357,4,B00J22YU62,"Sometimes I think a rating system that allowed for ratings across multiple criteria would be really useful, although such a thing would still be prey to the Amazon sock puppet phenomenon, wherein crap amateur films are somehow rated as equal to, say, The Shining within a few days of their initial release.  I say that in regards to this particular film because, while its cinematography, acting, writing, production, etc are all the sort of high level that is Hollywood standard (and much better than a lot of Hollywood dreck), the appeal of this movie is going to be pretty limited.

This is a fairly rare type of alien film that deals with a sort of Pinocchio effect: a thing/creature designed to look like a human tries to discover what it is to be human.  It of course must end in tragedy, but it says something about the character development and Johansson's excellent portrayal that the viewer can feel some empathy for a creature that entices and then ... Not really sure how to describe what happens to the victims, but rest assured, it's fatal.

This is a slow build, with some creepy surreality, one or two slight shocks, and one absolutely hilarious ""I HAVE A WHAT NOW??"" moment (you'll know, it involves a lamp, and I laughed out loud).  But people looking for gore, jump scares, or a nerve-stringing tension fest are going to be very disappointed.

We're both diehard SciFi fans, but this was more like an art film. The movie was so hard to follow that it just wasn't worth watching. It was truly obnoxious from the very beginning -- no sound, then irritating sounds, with visuals that don't make any sense at all. Eventually you finally get some actual dialog, but nothing of any consequence. The editing was confusing throughout the limited portion we suffered through. We finally decided to turn it off after the bizarre sequence that begins with Johansson's character leading this fellow into a dark building. The room seems to go on and on, but the guy never wonders why or what kind of strange place this must be. You see Johansson walking ahead, disrobing, then cuts back to the fellow doing the same some distance behind her (warning guys, there's a brief 'full monty' of the fellow), then he inexplicably is suddenly chest deep in some type of black liquid, still apparently oblivious, but she's walking on the surface of whatever this fluid is. You see her turn around and walk back, but the guy has simply disappeared. No thanks. I like my movies to have some symblance of a plot and to pull me in from the get-go, not bore me to death. I guess guys might like seeing Johansson naked, but even my hubby wasn't impressed.",1433376000,,1413,4.633466135458168

If you appreciate good film and are open to a unique movie experience, you have to give this a try.  Yes, it is slow as all get-out, so be patient.  Creepy sexy ScarJo is some kind of alien tasked with the incredibly inefficient job of luring in lonely men one at a time to...uh...basically be digested.  SURELY there is a better way for an alien race to come eat us, like, I dunno, mass invasion, but whatever.  This movie is about being creepy as heck without being a typical horror movie.  There is almost no dialog in this movie (and half of what is in it is almost unintelligible Scottish), and certainly no explication of the plot -- at no time is this movie going to hold your hand and explain to you, ""Okay, see, obviously once the men are inside the lair there is some kind of mental numbing going on because they don't run, and another thing you should know about ScarJo the alien is that she is monitored by this other alien....""  You're going to have to figure it out for yourself.  And the end, well, at first you might be ticked off.  You might sit bolt upright on the couch and yell, ""That's IT?""  I think I did that.  And you might be annoyed that after all that, you didn't get something more satisfying and neatly wrapped up with a bow.

But then, later that night, the next day, the next week, you will want to watch it again.  And maybe again.  It will haunt you.

At first I didn't want to see this when I saw a critic quote in the trailer that this movie was made by ""this generation's Stanley Kubrick,"" because I loved the book 2001 yet the movie 2001 is like ""...what? What happened? Why am I watching this paint dry?  Oh, paint drying in space. Death?  Oh, it's over.""  And this movie is very Kubrickian.  But somehow, I loved this movie.  Maybe I'm more mature now and should give 2001 another chance.

Oh and if you like this, you should give ""Enemy"" with Jake Gyllenhaal a shot, too.  And vice versa.  It's the same kind of slow, unsettling, wtf just happened kind of trip.",1433376000,3,2109,4.351282051282051

It was as if they were trying hard to fill a full movie slot so they had to take every boring scene and extend it.  Worse, there was barely any plot to this story.  A bunch of random boring scenes with little explanation.  Even the description of the movie on Amazon gives you more description than what you actually see.  It seemed as if they wanted to make it a bit artsy, but it wasn't even very impressive in that arena.  Also contained lots of great scenes that with such poor lighting that you could barely see anything.

I watched this with someone who had read the book.  Now the story itself seemed very interesting.  But they did not incorporate hardly anything from the book in the movie.  They had a lot of good material to work with and I have no idea why they did not include any of it.  It could have actually been interesting.  If I was the author of this book I would not be happy to have all of my creative ideas trashed and ignored.

6311430,2,B00J22YU62,"This could have been absolutely fantastic, however there are serious issues with its presentations.

1) Its delivery fluctuates often and quickly between scenes which are figurative or metaphorical with virtually no explanations
--If you've ever watched the ending to American Psycho where it intentionally leaves you guessing then be prepared for that same confusing feeling over the entire course of this movie in spades

2) Scarlett Johansson's acting in the first half of the movie is superb but in the second half she loses character. You will understand why this happens but the execution is poor and sudden

3) Johnathan Glazer (director) delivers this movie in a pretentious fashion, which when combined with vague metaphors and figurative scenarios muddles up the entire plot. This movie could have been much better without so much imagery and a little more dialogue

4) You are very unlikely to ever understand the actual plot to the movie. The delivery of the sequences of Scarlett's interactions between her and human society make 2001 Space Odyssey look like an episode of Tom and Jerry for straightforwardness.

5) If ever you were disappointed by any movie having an ending that was just awful, this movie will make all the others tolerable by comparison

So is this a bad movie? Not necessarily. If you give the movie a chance it could hold you in thought. The nature of the movie is to make the viewer guess and keep watching to obtain more information to derive a meaningful plot and conclusion, but the director definitely does not give the audience this. Even if you look on the internet for answers you will find none because the plot is so completely open to interpretation that it fails to offer any plot at all.

MINOR SPOILER BELOW, but I suggest you read this anyway to help you get the most from a confusing movie
-- Scarlett is probably an alien in a human form. This is both literal and metaphorical and the confusing intro is full of meanings, which seem to include a spaceship landing on earth
-- ""Under the Skin"" is both a reference to her alien body inside of a familiar human body, but also is a metaphor for beauty and sex because she is something ""other"" beneath the white skin. All humans are 99% the same under the skin, but she is not
-- The movie uses sex and the female body to illustrate how alien (""other"") a woman can be. Feminists will understand this since ""other"" is a common term used to describe the sensation of being human but not being treated as a human, but rather as something ""other"" which carries a double meaning since she is literally an alien
-- The movie is extremely boring but also engaging, where you might hate it for lacking the answers you seek but have the desire to see it through to the end because you want to have the answers...be warned, you will not get any answers
-- This movie makes Scotland look like the worst place in the entire world to ever go to

BE PREPARED TO SEE THE MOST DISGUSTING SCENES OF MALE GENITALIA. This movie is not for the sexually faint of heart. You can come to your own conclusions about the movie when you see it.

6311444,4,B00J22YU62,"Though this is a very slow film that at times seems completely unfathomable, it is in fact very good hard scifi.  Through the entire film, I was fascinated with the mystery of it - what the heck was going on? - as well as the mesmerizing presence of Scarlett Johansson, who proves herself a versatile and cerebral actress.  If you are not put off by the unusualness of it, the film is a rewarding experience of how an alien might perceive life on Earth.  You can watch it multiple times and see more each time.

The nameless woman is a kind of observer and predator, bringing men to a mysteriously otherworldly lair where they disappear into a kind of primordial muck.  She attracts them with sexual allure then goes out in search of her next prey, seemingly hungry for experience but at a distance from human emotion.  She even witnesses the destruction of a family on a wavy beach with complete lack of emotion.  In time, she seems to become curious, first observing her body and then apparently wishing to experience the senses that come with it.  She lets one of her victims go, a lonely deformed man.  This makes her vulnerable and she goes kind of renegade.  I do not wish to reveal what happens in the end, but it is a surprising transformation.

One of the things that kept me going on first view was the unexplained.  It is great food for the imagination, as only the best scifi can do.  For example, she seems to have some accomplices, but what they are doing and what their relationships are never become clear.  The last images are wonderfully striking, only adding to the mystery.  In multiple viewings, there are many details that seem to fit, such as the tear in the woman's eye in the beginning.

I can see why this was a box office failure.  It is serious and yet obscure hard scifi, not action or even horror.  While it worked for me, I suspect it won't for most viewers, though it will certainly achieve cult status.  Unfortunately, the marketing tool of displaying Johansson nude may overshadow how fine and subtle her acting is.  The film operates on many levels.

You have to watch the paint dry on this dreary and dreadful slow paced - generally nasty - pink elephant. I realize this is going to be a POLARIZING movie. You'll either LOVE IT or HATE IT. A mix of Stanley Kubrick, Rod Serling and Don Coscorelli but it's a mixture stirred with a toilet brush. Our lovely Scarlett wears Kristen Stewart's facial expression for the duration, only smiling twice I think, casting voluptuous alien bait while trawling for solitary dudes no one will miss. She leads them into an old house in the woods that holds a doorway into an other-dimensional tar pit of sorts. As she strips naked they blindly follow her into the quagmire that sucks them down below its surface then sucks out their vitals, leaving behind empty skin like a deflated balloon - imagine raw meat going up a conveyor and through a portal to....another dimension?.... another planet? There's a frustrating lack of explanations and less dialog than a chess match. ""What we got here is....failure to communicate."" One thing is abundantly clear. Scarlett's ""alien"" is cold, dispassionate and robotic. ""She"" walks by a sea cove where there's a family, apparently picnicking. There's a  father, mother, boy and baby. The boy is swimming and gets pulled out to sea by the current. The mother jumps in...caught in the current, father runs and jumps in...he's dragged out to sea too and so they all drown. The toddler is left alone on the beach crying. The ""Scarlett Alien"" is walking by, observing all of it as we would ponder a softball game while walking past a park, never showing the slightest emotion or concern, she continues on her way. There's also the matter of another alien being who rides around on a motorcycle apparently on his own mission which is wholly unexplained. I won't say much about the ending except that it was anticlimactic. So! Let's summarize. Puzzling, dreary, dispassionate, slow, nasty, no sympathetic protagonist, a blank antagonist, and boring enough to win the OSCAR for Best Picture (remember Dangerous Liaisons? Of course not! Who DOES?). Scarlett's most boring movie since THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL.  Too DULL to classify as a THRILLER. Too VAGUE to classify as SCIENCE FICTION.",1431561600,,2274,4.88860103626943

Any individual who has felt disconnected from the rest of society and subsequently turned to self-destructive methods for a quick-fix will find the film appealing. It might be more difficult, for those who have never had to seriously question the direction of their lives, to empathize with the protagonist. No matter your ability to relate to the narrative, the exquisiteness of the cinematography is inarguable.",1431475200,,752,5.223140495867769

6311489,5,B00J22YU62,"So many ways to start this review...

It takes a certain kind of moviegoer to be able to watch a mostly quiet film.

There is only dialogue in this movie where it is needed. Instead, the cinematography and the score along with acting set the mood perfectly. It also takes a certain kind of actor to pull off a mostly silent role. I have earned a new respect for Scarlett thanks to this movie.

There are not enough headlining actresses who are willing to bare all for the camera. This happens to be a story where it is necessary for this to happen, and Scarlett is perfect for the job. Is it my inner perv that is so happy about this? Possibly. But the art lover in me is also beaming with joy.

When I started watching this film it was one I had never heard of. I read a part of the quick synopsis before starting the movie, and I didn't even realize Scarlett was starring in it. I am very glad she did.

In short: Every once in a while we need a movie like this. Quiet, cerebral, eerie, dark, sci-fi. Not the kind of thing you want to watch every night, but certainly the kind of thing that you want access to from time to time.",1431388800,,1130,4.141552511415525

6311525,5,B00J22YU62,"This movie is amazing. I can't stop thinking about it. Before you watch it, realize that if narrative hand-holding is your thing, this is not for you. There is a definite and clear narrative here, but it is not spelled out in dialogue, you will have to work it out on your own. I'm not going to knock people who like obvious story arcs, but nothing irritates me more than when an essential plot element is deliberately revealed through clumsy, forced dialogue just as it's needed. Also, if you like huge explosions and warp-drive spaceships, this is not for you.

The best science fiction movies are always about what it means to be human. This movie takes that idea head on as the hero alien, a seductress preying on men, becomes both seduced by the human experience and, ultimately, prey herself. The tension builds slowly but surely, every scene is a purposeful commentary on the ""emotional"" development of the hero, and the soundtrack is 70's-horror-movie pastiche, which is pretty cool given the subject matter.

6311564,5,B00J22YU62,"One of the best movies I've seen in many years. And I watch a lot of movies.

The hatred and indifference in the reviews here on Amazon is ironic.  This is a movie about ""the other"" in society... a movie which revels in the dark confusion of identity.  It is about what being different feels like.  So it does not surprise me that so few people can appreciate it.  We are a culture who goes to movies to see something comfortable and recognizable.  Even when we meet strangers from another land or planet in our movies... they all seem to act and talk just like us, right down to their pre-packaged marketing dialogue phrases: ""I'll be back.""  How reassuring for people and particularly Americans... who like to always think they know it all or can fight every enemy (alien) with our innumerable weapons.

""Where are the guns?"" audiences wonder?  ""Where is the fast-paced, choreographed, slow-motion fighting?"" Or perhaps, ""Why aren't all the characters speaking English and explaining everything that is happening, WHILE it is happening?""  ""Where are the funny catch phrases?"" ""Where are the sex scenes with the hot actress who I just saw in the tabloids?""  ""O help me please! It is not ALL being explained to me!  I don't know who to root for because they're not wearing opposite colored jerseys!"" they cry out... having been spoon-fed all this repetition for years by the Hollywood machinery where OTHER (weird) cultures, genders and attitudes are all boiled down to the same (usually male) ""American"" ideals.  ""Movies all need to look and feel like MEEEE!!""  It is pretty ironic.

This is a beautifully photographed, edited, and directed movie. There is nothing wrong with a movie being slow paced, I feel, provided there is ample material within the pacing to contemplate and explore. And there is here.  This is a welcome return to movie making as a thoughtful often perplexing odyssey through repressed emotions and strange ideas. The story in this (yes, there is one if you actually pay attention) is oblique and mysterious. The story gently overlays cultural questions which are really quite close to home for all human beings when we look into the eyes of someone outside of our own heads... who we must admit we don't really know.  And that can be a bit uncomfortable but it is certainly worth thinking about.

If those kind of ideas don't interest you, then go watch a Star Wars... (I hear they're making another one.... which will be SO very different than the last six but with all the WAR parts still intact.)",1430438400,5,2524,4.789838337182448

Brad Pitt made the right decision walking away from this one, Scarlett should have been on his heels, but then again she became the lead role. My biggest beef's the repetitive nature of seducing, entrapping and emulsifying the victims, while visually well done, gets old quick. Its okay if the first one is easy, but it should get harder as the film moves on, up the ante, things should go wrong, turn up the heat for God's sake, drama is a good thing.

Once I watched it I just couldn't see how he could possibly be talking about this total train wreck of a movie.

All that goes on in this movie is the always beautiful, sexy, and highly talented Scarlett Johansson stars as some hot yet nameless alien driving around Scotland seeking out sleazy Scottish men only to take them to her apartment, have them strip naked expecting a hot time and get them to step into her swimming pool, only to have them wind up dead with their skin removed.

I didn't get why she would wish any harm on that nice Scottish guy(on the beach)who risks life and limb to save a child from drowning.  That was just rotten of her to do.  Seeing Scarlett nude from far away wasn't amusing either.  When she finally does a close up nude scene, it's too dark in the room to see much.  Total jeers to that!  I also couldn't make heads or tails as to why of all unneccessary things to come up one of the guys that she picks up turns out to be a disturbingly deformed Scotsman who was out shopping.  Thankfully she spares his life, but I neither seen what the point was to that part of the movie nor do I see why he leaves her apartment walking around completely naked.  She eventually meets up with a nice, decent guy, and even falls in love with him, but for no clear rhyme or reason she gets up in the morning and leaves him high and dry.  After that the movie proceeds to more pointlessness that I will spare you all.

To sum it up this sad excuse of a movie:  I  as the unfortunate viewer was left with several unanswered questions.  And they are as follows:  Why does this movie have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling a plot?, Why wasn't there any info about sexy Scarlett Johansson's alien character?  For instance, why is she on Earth to begin with?, What is her characters name in human form or alien?, What planet is she from?, Why did she go to Scotland in particular?, Why is she so evil, cold, and unlikable?, Where's the character development?, Who did they honestly think this movie would entertain?, Why ignore all the conventions that make a movie entertaining, watchable, memorable and above all worthwhile?, Why was the pace so unbelievably and mercilessly slow?, Why did the script come off like a 14 year old wrote it?, Who did they honestly think this complete waste of time would entertain?, and above all, could this movie possibly be more flat and boring?  LOL!

Who/whomever made this so-called movie is an amateur and should quit while their barely ahead. Better still hiding in a cave from the  shame of this turkey would be quite justified too.",1429142400,4,2809,4.470588235294118

I did not read the book and although I could figure out what was happening, I was spending too much time in that effort rather than enjoying the movie.

These guys she seduces seem TOTALLY oblivious to the situation and their surroundings as they follow her into desolate houses in secluded rural areas, enter into pitch blackness, and follow this chick blindly as they strut nonchalantly into the floor, which by the way is some river of black goop. Just totally stooopid.

One minute she's in a van, the next she's on a bike, the next she on foot.  She seems to have houses all over town and she inexplicably goes from a seductress with the power of speech to some walking mute zombie who doesn't sem to even know where she is.

6311701,2,B00J22YU62,"I thought this film was hugely ambitious but insanely over rated. I believe UK critic Guy Lodge called this the best film of 2014 and I have to say he's waaaaayyyy off the mark here. It's clearly a well made, ambitious venture from Jonathan Glazer that certainly has some mesmerizing moments (in particular Johansson's Alien encountering a man w/ a severe facial dis-figuration) but quite frankly doesn't really add up to much. There seems to be no overarching theme the filmmakers are trying to explore which can probably be laid at the feet of a week and somewhat inept script.

Inevitably, comparisons to 2001 abound in which the unknowability, if you will, that Alien lifeforms take. What is their purpose? What do they want, etc? Kubrick (& Clark) uses this aspect of unknowability to advantage in coming up w/ the Monolith. Conversely, Glazer et al by comparison just seem clumsy and inept as they try and fit this unknowable entity into human terms, into scenarios we can glean from or understand. The 'Alien' becomes more human that the human's, etc. In fact, a much better point of comparison maybe Nicholas Roeg's The Man Who Fell To Earth, an infinitely better, more expertly conceived narrative and better executed film than this one. (Yes, the Spfx in Under the Skin are quite good, maybe trumping the 'alien planet' scenes for Bowie's character, but given the wide use and availability of CGI that's not such an accomplishment by today's standards.)

Also, the film was very cold in almost every may. Pauline Kael famously quipped about Kubrick's weakness in creating warm, human characters that HAL was the best character he'd ever come up w/, but compared to this film HAL is a cross between Jim Carrey and Robin Williams...",1428451200,,1740,4.894915254237288

But it was diffuclt to fully enjoy it because it is so ""art-housey"" (weird), there is very little dialogue, and there isn't a fully formed narrative, just the skeleton of one.

If you liked ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", you'll like ""Under the Skin"". I liked the cinematography and the abstract ideas of ""2001"", but was bored by the same abstractedness that was the film's narrative and lack of dialogue like I was with ""Under the skin.""

The two movies are somewhat similar, such as in both One Face, One body carries almost the full weight of the drama.

As for the alien part, it had promise, but of course we do not know the purpose, nor do we get an idea.

6311872,5,B00J22YU62,"Too many haters recently here, so I feel a need to redress the balance. Yes, this isn't for people looking for the usual movie shtick. Nothing gory, no explosions, no real drama, etc. Very little dialogue. It was filmed in a unique way: Scarlett Johansson drove around in a van picking up unsuspecting guys in Dublin, I think, and inviting them back to her place. Apparently none of the men recognized her. There's a deformed guy who was hired for the part and he's the soul of the movie, but he was also a non-actor. Johannson took the part because she considers the director a genius, and she knows what she's talking about. (All this from a terrific interview with her.) She thought the picking up men on the street idea was crazy and found it very uncomfortable, but it wasn't crazy, not at all. For somebody in her position at the top of the profession, she had a lot of guts to take on a project this fundamentally noncommercial.
This movie isn't really about plot--it's more a state of mind that evolves very slowly to a tragic conclusion. It's been aptly compared here to 2001 and to Hitchcock, though Hitch would never have done something this esoteric. The story doesn't explain itself much, but it's really a simple sci-fi conceit: a couple of aliens, one in the skin of a beautiful woman, pick up men in order to feed on them. (The alien guy rides a motorcycle--I think a nod to Cocteau's Orpheus, where Death's henchmen are motorcyclists.) En route it's a meditation on beauty, on humanity, on movie stars, on sexuality, on empathy, and various things in that direction.
The denouement is when the alien woman, after her encounter with the deformed man, begins to feel empathy for her victims. Eventually she ends up in bed with a guy, and that's the turning point: she discovers apparently for the first time that she has no genitals. She wants to be a human being now, but she isn't. And if she is not a predator of human beings, she's nothing. That discovery, and her newfound empathy with human beings, is her tragedy and her doom.
But again, all that is just one side of the film, which is as much involved with atmosphere and mystery and isn't straightforward about explaining itself. The cinematography ranges from marvelously beautiful to gritty street-cinema. If you can get onto its unique wavelength, you'll never forget it.",1426723200,8,2348,4.687651331719128

The restraint in production glitz makes it all come a little too close for comfort - which I personally think is great. Comfort can be a nice aspect of our lives certainly but it is definitely over-rated. Comfort - not the movie. The movie is clearly under-rated here - but that could have been easily predicted.

This film is not action-packed and does require a natural patience - not a forced patience - you know who you are. It is not going to be everyone's cup 'o tea as everyone simply has different tastes.

6311927,5,B00J22YU62,"Um. Wow. It's really weird to see how many horrible reviews this movie got... way out of proportion to any positive reviews.

Personally, I absolutely loved it. Best movie I've seen in a while. I don't know what everyone else was expecting. Action movie or something? Or I guess some of them were expecting a closer interpretation of the book (which I haven't read... yet). I can understand disappointment at a movie edition, having been burned by that a few times, but I'm also pretty good at treating the movie and book versions of things as completely separate entities, if the other still has merit.

This does. It's slow, very slow-paced. But never for an instant boring. The premise (which probably differs completely from the book, hence the disappointment I guess?) is essentially about a monster, caring nothing for those she manipulates and beguiles, who gradually becomes self-aware, grows the beginnings of a conscience, and a curiosity about herself and the world around her. This simple idea is played out at a deliciously serene pace (with some decidedly sharp-edge moments), letting the movie's imagery speak as much as possible.

The first half of the movie seems to be devoted to demonstrating how utterly without empathy or concern for any human being she is - boundlessly monstrous. And then a moment arrives where she seems to begin to understand what she's doing, at a level she had not, and leaves to find herself, and try to pick up the pieces of her confusion, and cope with the unconquerable differences between herself and the people that she would otherwise allow to become part of her life.

The end is tense, and a little surprising (but not very - there are shocking moments in the movie, but not ever really surprising, as the was telegraphed loudly from the second the movie begins), and possibly anticlimactic... but seems fitting anyway. I enjoyed the whole ride quite a bit.

So, bottom line: if you loved the book and are hoping for a movie version of it, my impression is you'll be disappointed. If you're easily bored/distracted and require constant stimulation, this is not your movie. If you like horror movies that don't depend on constant shock-value, but rather subtlety, suspense, revulsion, with a few shocks peppered more tastefully, then you may love this, as I did. (I also loved the Swedish movie ""Let The Right One In"", which I think could be compared in some ways stylistically with this).",1426464000,10,2441,4.886473429951691

Instead, I was blown away by Jonathan Glazer's dark masterpiece. This is not a literal translation of the book, it is an adaptation. An yet, the adaptation is true to the spirit of the book and manages to capture the creeping horror of the story, from the original cold inhumanity of Isserley as she hunts and captures her prey to her gradual transformation away from a cold inhuman predator.

I know, not very helpful.  I was greatly bothered by this movie.  And yet I went and rewatched it a month later.

This is not a typical flick.  To get something from it, you have to invest something of yourself.  Thought, comparison, revelation.  You have to do some heavy lifting.

If you're not up for that, fine, go watch a Michael Bay flick or some Star Wars.  It's OK, we all enjoy those movies.

But I think that Coen Brothers fans and followers of Kubrick will know this heavy lifting of which I speak.  You will study this film, and see just what it is doing, and how it is a study of humanity.  And as you watch this film, you become part of the study and may figure out something of your own humanity.",1426377600,,796,4.117647058823529

This is a modern mind screw of a film. The imagery is laced with the imaginative mind of the unknown. A story book telling of the very recesses of the nightmarish world of the sub-conscience. This movie is amazing. It's a modern-day masterpiece of perfection, done in the visceral surreal setting of filmmaking. It has a true avant-garde stamp. It bleeds the inner reality of an Ingmar Bergman film. It has the landscapes and the waves of a pure visual reality that only Andrei Tarkovsky could visualize and yet Jonathan Glazer has become the new master story teller and visual god.

This movie is brilliantly acted. Stunningly crafted and amazingly performed by Scarlett Johansson. She owns her part and creates a character like no other. This is her shining moment. She is utterly flooring, beautiful, stunning and magically interesting beyond words as the character of Laura.

The sound effects, noise and haunting atmosphere bleeds deep into your mind. This film brings out emotions beyond understanding. A visual experience of perfection.

6312021,4,B00J22YU62,"Fair warning this film is about as far a cry from The Avengers as one could possible get. However, this is perhaps the most interesting take on the ""Alien/ Sci Fi"" genre that I've seen in a while. While certainly an ""art film"" the picture does have several incredible strengths that lend some meat to what might otherwise be a bone dry film. In every way this film lives up to its name- both literally and figuratively. With very little dialogue, what carries this film most is the emotive quality it creates through visual and audio imagery. Breath taking panoramic shots, not accomplished by cgi or even sophisticated editing or camera work, but by simple, articulate, frigidly objective captures of the Scottish highland, costs, and city streets. Beneath these cold, still frames, the score slithers and weaves, eliciting sincere tension, anticipation, and suspense. Johansson's performance is unlike anything in her career thus far, finding the perfect balance of warmth and cold to create a truly interesting character. The true brilliance of the film is the way in which the culmination of Johansson's performance and Director Johnathan Glazer's execution are able to take the familiar and tilt it every so slightly to create an intriguing, slightly disturbing alien world of our very own Earth.

My best recommendation for enjoying this film is to eliminate as much as possible any and all expectation. Just open up and allow the film to move and pull you in. This is not a film about intense, climactic scenes, sharp cuts, rapid fire pace. This film is not a means of getting our explosion-thirsty rocks off.

Have you recently been declared brain dead by a licensed physician?  Then you might like it.  Long, boring scenes where nothing is added to the film in any way are constant.

Okay, the only way you should watch this is if you are high on something.

What a very rude awakening.....I've read some of the reviews, no dialogue, no character build up and lots of one stars.....I think acting is also about emotion, intensity,feelings and the ability to project of those feelings onto the screen was a job well done. Still once again, another story of who are they, what do they want....the question continues to elude us. It left me with questions...are they here? if so, why? after all, the ending was her grand illusion gone wrong...she can't be like 'them'...like 'us'...because in the end....she is not.

I really watched it because I was attracted to the poster image, I thought it looked neat with the stars and stuff. After watching the film, I looked it up on IMDB and saw that Jonathan Glazer made two other movies I saw called Sexy Beast and Birth. I guess this is more in line with Birth but way different. A complete and total head trip.  Anyway, you can't even imagine what this movie is really like. IT FREAKED ME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS. Honestly, I kept thinking about who this woman was and her agenda and the soundtrack (score) is phenomenally creepy and memorable. I kept laughing when I was watching the Oscars last weekend and seeing Desplat (who I do like) finally winning for a mostly forgettable score. Under the Skin has a truly amazing movie score. This movie is batsh*t insane. If you like science fiction or creepy kind of movies --- you gotta watch this. It's hard to describe what is going on because for maybe the first hour , I didn't really get it. But I was super intrigued in that same way I felt watching David Lynch's movie Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive. Scarlett Johansson has always been a really solid actress, I've liked her a lot in different things from Lost in Translation to Match Point even to her movies as a kid like Manny & Lo --- I think this might be her best performance. She was just totally embodied in this otherworldly psycho horny alien. The scenes of her ""lair"" are truly amazing to behold, visually and with that score - again... Under the Skin is one of the most interesting, confusing and wildest movie trips I've taken in a real long time. I won't ever forget seeing this.",1425081600,,1696,4.435897435897436

Subtly is great, but this movie is almost mute in explaining the purpose and methods of the primary character. I believe the reality for the most movie goers is: it was a great vehicle to see a beautifully shaped woman be naked and men naked as well (not so perfectly shaped though).

We do see that she (it) decides to try human food and sex as, I think, her, the aliens way of trying to understand humans. This is the strongest part of the movie without enough investment of time.

Unfortunately, the skin over the alien was such a poor choice as technical way of explaining her 'human transformation'. Check out the Star Man movie for a much more understandable and organic way of becoming a human.",1424908800,,824,4.516778523489933

In ""Under the Skin"", she's some kind of alien who lures random men in with promise of sexual liasions, as they disappear into a black goo.  In ""Lucy"", she ultimately turns into black goo at the end.  What's with all this viscious black goo going around these days, huh?  Anyway, in this film, men are subsumed into the goo.  At first I thought it was a metaphor for them being subsumed into her true essence (which we see at the end, is all black (and I mean pitch/coal black) under the skin.  She is apparently some type of alien inhabiting a human form to devour human men for their meat??  As when they are engulfed in the goo, they are swimming about, but still breathing--until processed, as the meat is sucked out of there bodies onto a conveyor, going into some kind of furnace.  It's almost as though the movie is trying to tell us that the assumption of human form imposes human qualities upon the being--whether it be spirit, angel, demon or extraterrestrial.  This film could have greatly benefited from the voice of an omniscient narrator, or at least Johannson's character voice her thoughts of her origin, her purpose, her mission--which is never made clear.  It's what made the original Blade-Runner work was the voiceovers of Deckard's (Harrison Ford's) character reflecting his thoughts, and thus making them known to the viewing audience.",1424736000,,1468,4.785714285714286

So-so sci-fi concept but the lack of a plot, dialog and character development left nothing but a rambling mess of a movie; me thinks the director is a Stanley Kubrick wanna-be. Very low-budget with indie-film feel, can't believe an A-lister like Scarlett Johansson signed up for something like this,  not a good career choice, hope she made tons of money doing the soft-porn stuff.

Seriously, what's up with all the full-frontal nudity, erections, and a Scotsman humping a hot-looking alien?  Was this supposed to be artsy?  Can't believe ScarJo would drop her kit for scenes like that,  just gratuitous eye-candy thrown in to keep the audience from walking out; found those bits God-awful to watch.

As another reviewer noted, I had to look up other people's reviews to figure out what this thing was all about!  And the only reason THEY seem to know what's going on is because they read the book.  After reading a plot summary from the original book, I found the film to be all the more ridiculous and scrambled-up -- the first-time viewer hasn't a chance at figuring out what's going on until (maybe) the very end.

6312206,5,B00J22YU62,"A bizarre masterpiece of 2014  is Jonathan Glazer's ""Under the Skin"" which seems to almost re-invent cinema itself in its refusal to avoid all narrative explanation.  While watching, each viewer must unravel the story solely from the film's images which range from the unearthly beautiful to the deeply disturbing, at times making Glazer seem the heir to Stanley Kubrick.

The plot, at least in its first half hour, is virtually undecipherable, but it tells of an alien entity taking the form of a seductive young woman who searches for human prey for reasons one must surmise.  Scarlett Johansson plays the alien with a detached dispassion and a slowly-developing empathy as she processes the variety of human behavior she is studying -- this is undoubtedly the cap of Johansson's career to date.

Magnificently filmed in Scotland, this is a sort of science-fiction horror story mated with ""Candid Camera"" (using hidden surveillance cameras pointed at real people on the street), while it goes way beyond its genre roots to ultimately form a statement of what the human experience is all about.  Using not only directing, editing, cinematography, art direction as well as the music score with brave new audacity, ""Under the Skin"" is a milestone in breaking out of the mold of conventional cinema.",1424390400,,1297,5.09433962264151

 Jonathan Glazer waited nine years before coming out with his next movie, ""Under the Skin,"" and one wonders why he couldn't have spared us and waited another nine years. The project only shines in the visual department as there's some beautiful cinematography by Daniel Landin, particularly of the Scottish Highlands. Glazer based his script on the novel of the same name by Michael Faber.

The story is a thin one: Scarlett Johansson plays an unnamed woman driving around Scotland in a van, picking up various men and bringing them to a house where they follow her naked into a black void. The men end up being killed with only their skins remaining. At first you wonder who is this woman but it soon becomes apparent that she's some kind of alien.

There are a few variations when it comes to guys Johansson picks up (some are played by non-actors who were initially filmed by hidden cameras). One of the men is a swimmer who tries to save a drowning couple. Johansson knocks out the exhausted swimmer and he ends up as another one of her victims, back at the house of horrors. A crying toddler is left to fend for himself on the beach by Johansson's alien.

More strange stuff: another one of the alien's victims is a sexually inexperienced man with a facial disfigurement. He escapes from the horror house, only to be recaptured by a man on a motorcycle, apparently an accomplice of the alien female.

The climax arrives when a man spots the alien in distress after she's reeling from eating a piece of cake at a restaurant. The man puts the alien up for the night, brings her to a ruined castle where they kiss and back at his home, they begin to have sex. The alien, however, freaks out and wanders into a forest. We don't know why but a logger tries to rape her and when he strips off her clothes, he discovers her body is not human. Then inexplicably, instead of running away in fear, he sets her on fire.

The ""big payoff"" turns out to be the revelation that the alien is wearing an exoskeleton and she looks more like a lizard with black, leathery skin. What exactly is Glazer's point? We never find out ""why"" the alien is bringing these men to the house with the weird black void and what it's attempting to gain by killing them. The attempt to convey some kind of atmosphere of dread or terror is lost by the unintentionally comical ending, where the alien is found to have no power and is dispensed with by a most unpleasant human rapist.

Glazer also doesn't realize what a burden it is having to listen to all the natives with their Scottish brogue--most of it is unintelligible. Subtitles should have certainly been in order.

""Under the Skin"" once again proves to be a project that undoubtedly will not advance Scarlet Johansson's career. Relying on her good looks alone is not enough to sway a critical audience that expects more. Glazer's ""folly"" consists of some brilliant cinematography coupled with an empty vessel of a script that leads nowhere.",1424390400,,3010,4.600746268656716

Scarlett Johansson stars in this sci-fi thriller as an alien who has an appetite for men.  She drives around in her white van searching for single men to take back to her run down country house in Scotland.  They meet their fate of a watery inky death as they are mesmerized by Ms. Johannsson's come hither stare.

Johansson operates in a purely robotic manner.  She is methodical and emotionless for the first half of this film.  She is also largely silent.  Her first scenes are of her silently disrobing a dead human (or it could be an alien, the movie goer can decide) then dressing in the dead girl's clothes.  Johansson looks very different than in any other film.  She is dark haired, with a shaggy cut and her coral rather unattractive lipstick makes her look both common and memorable. She mimics well the modern day human on the make sans tinder.  She has another alien with her on Earth who seems to be her leader.  He is silent but instead of being seductive like Johansson, he is threatening.

There are many boring scenes of Johansson trolling the city (I assume Glasgow) for unsuspecting men.  It's important that the men be single (I assume these aliens realize their jig could be up if authorities are alerted too soon of missing persons). Too much time is spent on these scenes with Johansson driving aimlessly, having short conversations with men and staring blankly out the window.  Instead of building anticipation, I became frustrated by viewing the same scene replayed.

By far the absolute best moments of this film are between Johansson and a disfigured man played brilliantly by Adam Pearson.  Here Johansson has her first real interaction with a human that is emotional.  These scenes are poignant as Pearson reveals his life of loneliness.  It actually takes this dialogue rather than Johansson's rather non-descript stares at crying babies or self-sacrificing humans for her to make a connection that is honest with a human.

From this moment on Johannsson is on a journey of self-discovery and the road is both interesting and dull.  Interesting as she interacts with humans as more than potential victims and boring in that it takes way too long for anything to happen. There's beautiful cinematography, although every outdoor scene shows Scotland as a dark, rainy kind of dreary place.

Johannsson has a wonderful voice sort of vulnerable yet also seductive too, so I was surprised that it was not utilized more often.  I was tired of watching her emotionless stares then her rather bemused expressions.  These are her favorite emotions.  Don't expect any big answers to the question of why the aliens are here and why are men only chosen.  These seem to be trivial matters to the director and writer but they were important questions to me.  Is this riveting, not so much due to the massive amount of time spent showing Johansson looking out in space or driving the roads of Scotland cocooned in silence, but it is thought provoking.  It is possible to have a movie be both; this is just not one of them.",1424304000,,3253,4.7710196779964225

The harvesting process was supposed to be much more intricate and grotesque. There was supposed to be an examination of social class when the ""inspectors"" came to visit. The sedative mechanism was wrong, the ending was different; basically everything they could've changed, they did. At least the movie got the nihilistic properties right. If you walked away from the film feeling kind of pointless then the movie did its job. What surprised me is that they managed to make a slightly slow book even more boring. At least the book had sufficient content.

The type of of people who like to have their hands held through the movie, don't like silence, or watch a movie just to see the nudity will most likely not enjoy this film. That's probably where the majority of the one star reviews hail from. For me this film was an easy 5 stars. I'm a fan of those moments in films where your character seems to just be ""being him/herself"" moving about, seemingly not driving the film forward. These moments get us to ask questions, begin to hypothesize and view the film from more than one angle. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of the scene in Kubricks direction of ""The Shining"" where the little boy was riding around his tricycle around inside. This is one of the most memorable scenes in all of film history for me, and one of my favorites. I try my hardest to keep an open mind, a scientific mind set, a will for faith in openness. Which is why i love science fiction, because how are we to know what may exist 3 trillion light years away? Science, sci-fi, and silence get you to ask questions. Questions which lead us to new experience, and it's through new experiences that we grow. Now, I don't mean to say that this film will have your heading spinning with questions, trying to understand a sliver of its' content. However, it will get you to ask yourself ""who? what? when? where? why? and how?"". You won't be confused after the ending, but you will want more. Just like our own life  you may struggle to find meaning, asking question after question. In the end, when you begin to close your book, you might  look back and think ""all I did was exist... observe... be felt by others"".

An alien being? or both?
Also, her transistion from uncaring monster to wondering what it is like to be human was fast and poorly done.

To give you an idea of whether it will suit your taste, consider whether you enjoy stark, visually appealing 'arthouse' style movies with sparse dialog. Think Stanley Kubrick's 2001 or Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris. Personally, I really enjoyed this film and believe it was a very bold direction for the cast and the director. If you are watching this because you like Scarlett Johansson's other films, prepare for a surprise. This film has very little in common with her big budget Hollywood productions. This is a very mature and complex film meant for a very sophisticated audience. It is not suitable for children (or small-minded adults). At the risk of sounding like a snob, this is a film for people who appreciate the art and craft of cinematography and storytelling over splashy special effects and banal dialogue. This is a very carefully crafted film and every scene seems to have been meticulously staged. It takes some patience on the part of the viewer to let the story unwind and present itself - but that is often the case with great artistic films.

6312397,4,B00J22YU62,"This strange, niche art film weaves haunting, beautiful, and some almost psychedelic imagery into a slowly unfolding story that continues to unfold for days afterwards. This is a smaller budget film by a visionary filmmaker. Johansson steps aside her media image in a role that could be commenting on it; the film seems to comment on beauty worship. The story is told in long scenes, sparse dialogue that is evidence rather than explanation for the narrative, and a hauntingly original score. The film lingers, yet its focus is so tight we're denied information that doesn't serve the point. (Like who or what the beings are, from where do they come or why most things are happening.) A beautiful, strangely unemotional woman is dispatched to prey on human men. Characters are nameless so I'll call our lead Sue. For realism, the film puts us in a covertly filmed cold, wet, real-world, common man's Scotland. Men on motorcycles serve as drones or minions, cleaning up clues and keeping watch on Sue. She's cold or blank as she drives a mini-van around Scotland hunting men. She pulls over to talk to them, turns on a smile, flirts and feigns interest to question and qualify them. (I read that some scenes use Johansson in character with real guys that play into her act.) We're shown her long hours and false nibbles as we learn she's seeking loners to manipulate back to the lair. This is from Sue's perspective so we see the lair as an environment of boundless black. The men don't seem to notice, but are transfixed by her removing articles of clothing. They follow her undressing fully. Naked, and erect by the mere anticipation of her, they follow her, oblivious to their doom. She does not exhibit emotion and we're shown the extent of her emotional disconnect in a few simple but unnerving scenes. After hours of searching, during which we watch as she observes, makes unintended engagements with people and experiences kindness, she begins to contemplate humanity, challenged by the concept she is not prepared to deal with.
I do have quibbles. The director uses over-long, lingering shots, where the camera holds for an uncomfortable amount of time. I found some too long; instead of inciting further observation they broke my connection. In an important scene the weak makeup effects lessened my investment in the moment. The story the film tells could well have been told as a more traditional short. However its scarcity and lingering amongst common, average people creates believability and wrings a wide and unexpected range of psychological and emotional responses. The scenes depicting full nudity are far from sexy but necessary to the story. They are evocative and unnerving as well. Uptick to 4 stars for a unique beauty and transcendent uncommon storytelling.  Down-tick to 4 for pacing issues and flawed effects.",1421539200,2,2835,4.968421052631579

Nearly every scene of this movie was ""artfully"" extended well beyond any meaningful impact. I found myself wondering how the movie would have played had every scene been cut down by half. Might have been somewhat interesting as a half-hour short. But is absolutely pointless as a full movie. If you make it past the half-hour mark it's because you're waiting for a killer payoff (there is none) or because you're the type of person who spends 15 minutes searching for meaning in a picture of a red dot on a field of black.

6312405,4,B00J22YU62,"Inexplicable and psychically jarring, Under the Skin has the seductive power of a nightmare. Written by Jonathan Glazer and  Walter Campbell and directed by Glazer, it is an art science fiction film that wanders between the visionary and the pretentious but mainly succeeds at what its trying to do - which is to get under your skin with its unsettling implications and mood.

Scarlett Johannson plays a strangely emotionless young woman who cruises around Scotland in a van, luring unattached young men back to her place, where they disappear into some kind of liquefied oblivion, leaving only their skins behind.

One day, she picks up an Elephant Man-type figure on whom she ultimately takes pity, releasing the disfigured man before he can be fully disappeared into the who-knows-where. This unaccustomed lapse into human compassion forces her to go on the run, though from whom were never quite sure. In fact, we are never made privy as to why she does what she does, only that she is inexorably compelled to do it.  And thats where the movie becomes problematic. On the one hand, one appreciates the writers refusal to spell everything out for the audience, thereby deepening the sense of mystery and challenging us to think for ourselves. On the other hand, with virtually no context for the womans actions, were essentially set adrift with just some truly creepy and disturbing moments and some truly stunning visuals to grasp onto. Indeed, the movie is marked by long stretches with little or no dialogue, often requiring the images alone to carry the story.

Perhaps, Johannson is the cold, soulless femme fatale character stripped (figuratively as well as literally) to her basic essence. Or perhaps not. Frankly, Im just spit-balling here.

But does it really matter in the long run? Why not simply sit back and allow oneself to be transported to the strangely off-kilter world of enigmatic plotting and surreal, painterly landscapes that the filmmakers have fashioned out of Michel Fabers 2000 novel.

Under the Skin is for looking at and connecting with on a visceral level - and the sooner you stop fretting about What It All Means, the sooner youll able to more fully appreciate its hypnotic power.",1421452800,2,2214,4.983739837398374

6312430,1,B00J22YU62,"CONTAINS SPOILERS BUT EXPLAINS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS THE MESSAGE OR WHY THE EVENTS OCCUR: This movie really disapointed me.  The reason I even watched it was so many reviews which said the book, and the movie were outstanding. I read quite a book about both the book and the movie before I watched it and it is a good thing I did. I thought this movie would never end. Repetative plot, very few details provided to supply context, meaning and direction. Based on what I saw in the movie, if I had not read about the book I would have absolutely no idea what was going on except that an alien, or android or multi-dimensional being who looks like a woman comes to this earth, or an alternate Earth, or an Earth-like planet and traps men in a pool of sticky black goo/water which disolves their insides and then magically loads the resulting red goo on to an assembly line and dumps it into a furnace which powers a very bright, white light.  Oh yes, we see the bright white light at the beginning and learn it is really an demonic eyeball!
  Anyhow, this ""woman-thing"" spins all of her time driving around to pick up male hitchikers or guys in bars, who she encourages by mumbling coherent comments about how she likes their eyes, hair and hands and them feeds them to the sticky black goo over, and over, and over. For some reason she begins to have trouble completing her ""assignment"" as well as loosing her ability to verbally communicate anything about what is going on. Sadly, the most exciting parts of the movie involve a scene where she trys to have sex but cannot (it seems to be painful for her but we have not idea why), or when a woodsman tries to rape her but tears off part of her skin along with her clothes, which reveals a plastic looking black female something. Then the entire think ends with the rapist pouring gas on the thing and setting it on fire.
  What did the movie lack, nearly evering thing. No backstory on the perps, no dialog to explain anyting. No idea why only men were being turned into chunky pink slime, no idea what was being done with the pink slime. No explanation for the gender roles (other alien was maybe her boss) why wasn't the male version collecting females instead of just chasing the female alien? Why did the female alien have breasts when she removed her skin by no vagina?
  It really struck me that the director made no attempt to explain anything to the viewer and that I was expected to ""magically"" figure out what was going on. I made the mistake of watching the movie from the very beginning to the end, but that really didn't help me to understand anything about the plot, backstory or message of this film.  One of the worst movie scripts I have ever seen.  Save yourself the trouble and don't watch this movie.  If the book is anything like this movie avoid it as well. Plan 9 from outer space had a better plot and was way easier to understand (and Plan 9 is rated as one of the worst movies ever made.)",1420934400,21,2964,4.4003656307129795

This is a very good movie for people with ADHD because there's nothing to remember: no plot, no characterization, nothing.

It's also an excellent movie to watch if you think you might need to leave before the end, because you won't be missing anything.

So all in all, it's hard to see what anyone might object to, aside from the fact that it's a complete waste of the time required to watch it.

The French used to make, back in the 1960s and early 1970s, incredibly self-indulgent films influenced by Sartre and the early post-structuralists. People killed themselves in movie theaters throughout France in order to avoid having to watch such creations to the bitter end. Or they emigrated. Or they (sensibly) stayed at home and watched snails mating in the garden. Under The Skin is eerily reminiscent of such films insofar as it will lead the viewer towards the contemplation of self-harm too, if only to relieve the utter tedium induced by this movie.

Well she is, but it still may not be enough of a reason to have invested the time watching this film, for many. Again, I truly liked this film a lot, just don't wish to paint a rosy picture about experiencing it.  I believe it is a wise decision to commit to watching it.

6312490,4,B00J22YU62,"This movie is clearly not for all tastes. Some of the visuals are off-putting, though it is beautifully filmed. This movie intends to examine what it means to be human, more specifically a woman. Scarlett Johnasson turns in a exceptionally nuanced performance as an alien being who inhabits the body of a human woman. Rather than your typical sci-fi movie where the alien is hell bent on human destruction or war, she simply ""wears the skin"" of a human and measures the reaction of others to her in a human form. Her stunning beauty attracts all types and Johansson sheds her clothes in the process in her first fully-nude role. In the process she ""harvests"" the bodies of the men she seduces as she travels through the countryside.",1420502400,,732,4.7265625

This story is about how an alien makes her living in a foreign world in which she's not well suited though she manages to function well enough, for a time. Ms. Johansson is good and the predator she plays is a creature with a conscience. there's alot more the writers could've explored: who the creatures are and why they're here, how they got here, where is their planet, what is that pool where the men are trapped, is it a different dimension, etc., but basically the main problem is no act two.

Under the Skin shows and shows and shows (yes, even ScarJo quite naked, but not at all salacious) but manages not to explain much at all. It's often pretty, sometimes ugly and quite surreal, but offers none of the mind expanding fish out of water philosophical discourse of the book.

While it's tough to review without spoiling, I think talking about the things the film's addressing rather than the plot itself, we can get by. I rated the book 5 stars and I'm disappointed at the adaptation, not with the adaptation per se, but that it got adapted at all. The film's more of an interpretation than an adaptation, and if they'd adapted it directly, it would have been the most bonkers thing on screen of the year. It doesn't fall far from that, but the book teaches a moral lesson, and the film, none. Unless you hate to read, read the book.

No one should be able to write a review that starts with ""I didn't watch all of it"". The movie is 108 minutes long. If you need a movie with tons of exposition and dialogue go watch Michael Bay or daytime TV. None of the plot is explained but it isn't that hard to understand. An alien comes to earth in the form of a human woman to seduce men and steal their skin. There is another alien in the form of a human male that has rank over her. Through her experiences with humanity she slowly starts to deviate from her mission and starts to see herself as a ""she"". They used hidden cameras to film Scarlett interacting with real people and places in character. The on location nature shots are beautiful. A certain horror scene is disturbingly stunning. The music and sound design is very memorable and really sets a good atmosphere. The Blu Ray comes with interviews with different cast members about different aspects of the movie.

In between her two pickups she drives, and drives, and then drives. This is a movie about her driving.

There is very little dialogue to indicate why she picks up these men. What dialogue there is could have been eliminated and it wouldn't make the movie weaker. The men don't seem to mind somehow finding themselves in a black featureless gestalt, as they seem fixated on the woman leading them, removing articles of clothing as she goes. I suppose everything is resolved at the end but by the time I stopped the movie I just didn't care-boredom had overtaken me.",1420070400,3,983,4.430939226519337

Visually and aurally stunning, with an unusually natural performance from Ms Johansson, there is much to appreciate here. What it lacks in clear thematic and narrative thrust, it generally makes up for in mood and the evocation of an emerging soul. Clearly a film that requires some patience and commitment from its audience, as well as a willingness not to be force-fed, it stakes a place almost exactly counter to the Hollywood studio fare of pumped out sci-fi blockbuster action films. As such, it is a well-needed tonic for some viewers, and just as likely a completely inexplicable work for others. At its heart, this film is mature and thoughtful with images that will likely linger in the mind for quite some time. It could have benefited from sharing some other moments in the story, perhaps, and the plot, such as it is, remains largely unresolved, but that isn't the point here.",1420070400,,1054,4.893854748603352

It's obvious that this movie gained mainstream distribution because of Scarlett J's participation and the promise of her bod on display, but there is nothing commercial about it whatsoever.  I knew immediately after seeing it that legions of people would watch and hate it, which is unfair to the flick really, because it AIN'T for the multiplex crowd.  If you scoff at the idea of ""art films"" then do not watch this.  You will hate it.  It's not a romantic comedy.

Under the Skin is a loose story of an alien in a woman's body, experiencing but not understanding human life.  It consists of a string of unrelated scenes.  It's very slow moving and oblique--it doesn't explain any of its mysteries.  Scarlet J looks good and does a passable English accent in her few lines of dialog.

Scarlett plays a young woman who trolls the highways of Scotland, looking for men. She lures them back to her place and, well you'll have to watch the film.

Truth be told, the film can be confusing. There are a few posts and blogs about it online that try to explain it. I am not sure it needs explaining. The film is loosely based on a novel by the same name. After reading the novel, I think it happens sometime after that novel ends. That is as close as I can get to explaining it.

So is it worth watching? Yes. if only for the questions it raises about humanity. We are pretty secure in our assumptions about how we are different from animals. Both this film and the novel challenge those perceptions.

At its worst, the film employed some interesting techniques in its production. At its best, it is a very stylish and well done story that only hints at what is clearly stated in the book. If you want to see a lot of Scarlett, watch it anyway. I will probably watch it again in the near future.",1419984000,,1127,4.382775119617225

For me, ""Under The Skin"" is like watching an overconfident film major desperately try to emulate Tarkovsky or Kubrick. The best thing I can say about it is the score is wonderfully creepy.

Be forewarned if you're looking for traditional plot and characters - the majority of the film is Scarlet Johansson driving around in a van while it's raining, picking up various strangers and making awkward alien small talk. I have no problem with ambiguity as I love Eraserhead, Mirror and other similar films, but Under The Skin is mostly just a pretentious bore. Thankfully, there are a few visually stunning albeit brief scenes to break up the monotony.

If you enjoy low-budget, cerebral arthouse science-fiction, you will (probably) find something to enjoy, or at least stimulate your brain. All I can say is I saw this with a small group of fellow cinema snobs and the film didn't work for any of us. Have to give Glazer credit for trying something different in the age of the sequel, reboot, remake and franchise, but this film will have an extremely limited audience.

The colors, the lingering shots, FILM THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING THROUGH IMAGE instead of the usual, ""and then, and then, and then"".

6312748,4,B00J22YU62,"UPDATE: I've read some of the negative reviews of UtS, and so am providing this update to my review.

When an audience member isn't trained in a particular pursuit, or lacks the ""tools"" necessary to understand what an artist is doing, they're at a disadvantage. Technical training in or study and knowledge of an art -- or many other things outside of art for that matter -- provides keys that help someone unlock doors.

For example, let's talk about something perhaps more accessible: basketball. I happen to be a huge basketball fan, played since I was a kid all the way through high school on my school teams, and have a well-rounded understanding of what basketball theory is. But to an outsider, who may or may not enjoy basketball, the game can just look like ten guys in chaos, just ""winging it"" and running around willy nilly. If they don't enjoy the game, they will use their lack of knowledge as an excuse to put down the game. If they enjoy it, they can find things to enjoy about it, the athleticism, when a player gets hot, a slam dunk, whatever. But they are cut off from the nuances of the game on many, many levels, and it is there that, for lack of a better way to put it, someone with a working knowledge of basketball theory, can extract maximum value over and above someone who lacks said knowledge.

And it's the same in many fields of endeavor, from writing to filmmaking to photography to architecture....

In addition, as I point out at the beginning of my review below, there is the distinction in some fields of art between escapist and interpretive art. This is also further complicated by some forms of art being ""more accessible,"" as in painting. Someone may enjoy an abstract or highly conceptual painting but not have any basis in painting or design, and yet, their enjoyment is valid, however, someone with a background has a much wider palette from which to draw.

On the other hand, movies exist on many more levels form-wise: on screen space, off screen space, sound and silence (and everything in between), light and dark (and again, everything in between), fast and slow (and again, everything in between), perspective (near and far or depth of field, and again, everything in between), etc. As an art *form*, movies encompass a much wider set of tools at the disposal of an artist than any other art. Thus, they theoretically present a much wider set of tools that can be used simplistically (what Noel Burch calls, ""the zero point of filmmaking"" or the straight match cut style of filmmaking that replicates ""reality"" that is perhaps best contradicted by Godard's jump cuts in his seminal ""Breathless""), or, in different ways, such as Glazer and UtS.

Whether that organization of film techniques is dialectical is another matter, and a whole other digression. We'll leave that for now at this fork in the road.

It really falls upon the viewer to constantly broaden their scope of perception, much like I alluded to Miles Davis at the end of my review. I may not have enjoyed the fruits of his explorations as much as some of his earlier works, but I understood why he was on a constant search. More, I respected that.

Glazer's ""Under the Skin"" has a simple story, really, and is fairly accessible. What's challenging is his form, the techniques he uses in the construction of UtS that, in relation to traditional commercial fare, stand in marked contrast, much like Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" or better, Tony Williams' ""Emergency"" at the time (even now!) to traditional forms of straight ahead jazz. The problem lies with the viewing audiences' lack of exposure and understanding of other forms of narrative *film* techniques/forms.

Having a bedrock of knowledge does not guarantee satisfaction of a movie like UtS -- that's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is that with such knowledge, one is able to move away from simplistically dismissive judgments -- ""it's artsy fartsy,"" ""it's pretentious,"" ""I've heard all of the intellectual nattering about this movie in a vain attempt to justify it,"" -- to an informed point of view that can assemble opinion from the many facets of an interpretive work of art. In Glazer's case of UtS, it's not so much the story, it's the form. With a working knowledge of film form, many doors that were heretofore closed unlock and open. But understanding of anything *takes work* -- study, pondering, thinking and researching, and perhaps that's the real road block here, particularly with American mainstream audiences who, vis a vis say, French or Italian viewers, who've been exposed to a much deeper array of talent (Godard, Bunuel, Bertolucci, Fellini, Antonioni) that have wrestled with film form outside of the typical ""straight ahead"" narrative style.

Understanding, having the working knowledge of an art form, again, guarantees nothing, except the wider scope from which a viewer can form an opinion. And that, in and of itself -- ***even if Glazer himself does not understand film form*** -- can be very rewarding, *even if one does not like a particular work of art.*.

======================================================================================

When a director such as Glazer attempts to create something outside of traditional narrative standards, the polarizing effect is easy to predict. It's easily explained in literature: the differences between escapist and interpretive writing, and the same holds true for movies. However, there are differences, as movies have their own unique syntax. Meaning, feeling, impact... is conveyed, or can be, in very different ways than with words. Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" is perhaps the high water mark for what I'm getting at. But Bunuel was also a Surrealist, and because of that, operated on a very different level than most. This doesn't invalidate ""Un Chien Andalou"" as an example, but does qualify it (him).

Glazer, on the other hand, injects plenty of obliqueness into UtS, and while it fits the vision he has for the movie, said oblqueness polarizes the masses accustomed to escapist, on point narrative technique.

That said, some comparisons have been made to Kubrick, and while I can see why they would say that, I think one reviewer's take that makes the connection to Nick Roeg is more apt.

In the end, UtS is worth seeing if you do not demand classic narrative forms of movie construction. One way that UtS is like Kubrick's ""2001"" or even ""Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" is that it is a movie that must be seen/heard, experienced. Reading the screenplay to ""Un Chien Andalou"" yields very little, while seeing it is a mesmerizing experience. While UtS is not in the same league as ""Un Chien Andalou"" (what is???) it is a good example of how movies are their own unique art form, replete with their own techniques and manner, and while it borrows from many of the other arts (writing, photography, design, music) its sum is unique and differentiated from all of the other arts.

Bottom line: UtS is worth seeing if you are seeking a filmmaker with a strong vision outside of the norm. It's like Surrealist painting; looking at a painting by Rufino Tamayo, Max Ernst, Paul Delvaux, or Leonor Fini yields very little if anything in terms of literal meaning, and yet the effect that they have while looking (thinking about them too?) at them is indescribable, like looking out into a world that's been revealed after a veil has been lifted. It's the new, and as Miles Davis once said when asked in his later, exploratory ""Bitches Brew"" years why he didn't play audience favorites like ""Kind of Blue"" anymore, in his trademark rasp said: ""If I played Kind of Blue"" now, it'd be like making love to an old woman.""",1419724800,,7664,4.879323597232898

6312766,4,B00J22YU62,"It sounds like the premise of a porn movie -- an alien visitor who looks like a beautiful woman wanders through cities, picking up men.

Instead, that is the central concept of ""Under The Skin,"" a hauntingly poignant sci-fi movie that is... well, not really like anything else you've ever seen. It's strange, abstract and devoid of a typical plot, relying mostly on the subtle cues of Scarlett Johansson's acting. But the way it's filmed is somewhat disconcerting, as it veers from Kubrickian surrealism to a gritty, awkward ""realism"" that feels improvised.

While dwelling in a blank negative space, a mysterious young woman (Johansson) steals the clothes of a dead girl found by the side of the road. Then she wanders through a Scottish city in her van, observing and experimenting -- she wanders through a mall, tries on lipstick, buys a fur coat, and so on. And of course, she picks up a number of semi-attractive young men.

Not so unusual, right? Well, she brings them into ANOTHER blank space, this one filled with an inky black liquid. She lures them into the liquid with her body, and leaves them to be sucked dry by it. Literally. In one horrifyingly creepy scene, a man sees a previous victim dissolving into nothing but a floating mass of empty skin, drifting down into the darkness.

Among her victims are a friendly electrician who accepts a ride, a man camping on the beach, a guy at a club, and a shy man who suffers from a facial deformity. But this peculiar routine begins to change as the woman begins to yearn for human connections; one of the men even leaves when her eerie stillness unnerves him. And behind her at all times is a mysterious motorcyclist who follows her.

""Under the Skin"" is not a movie that answers questions. What was the woman's purpose in being here? What does the black liquid do? Is there a practical reason for her to kill all these men, or is it part of the process of trying to absorb the human condition that she clumsily imitates?

Nope. Not answered. It's a movie that gives you several jigsaw pieces so you can fill in the gaps with your own imagination. Director Jonathan Glazer prefers to let this story drift on its own, at times almost like a silent film -- while there is sound, he prefers to let visuals tell the important parts of the story. For instance, the woman's increased attentiveness to humanity is represented by countless golden-hued images of people she sees, growing more complicated and abstract until it becomes a fluttering, scintillating map around her lovely blank face.

So what is this movie's flaw? As far as cinematography goes, it actually feels like two movies. The cinematography of the ""everyday"" world of Scotland shows it off in its grey-skied, slightly wild beauty, both in nature and in the grubby cities. In these scenes, it feels almost like cinma vrit. The dialogue is awkward and stammering, dwelling on unimportant topics, with long pauses -- almost like real speech. Then we switch to the silent, hauntingly surreal science-fiction of the black sea and its seething channels of blood, filmed crisply and without the sting of ""realism.""

It's very disorienting, and the only thing that seems to unite these two ""worlds"" is the soundtrack by Micachu, which enhances the eerie otherworldliness of the story. It's twisting, trembling, stark music with a drum like a heartbeat. Whenever her music is playing, you can't forget that weird things are happening.

Scarlett Johansson's performance is absolutely phenomenal here, playing a lonely, cold creature that seeks the warmth of human experience, but cannot truly grasp it.. While technically acting ""normal,"" she infuses most of what her character says with a subtle weirdness -- an artificiality that belies the chilly inhumanity underneath. Her character cannot grasp what humans are all about, yet we see her struggling to do so -- trying to connect to people in a clueless, awkward way, trying to eat cake, trying to have sex, and so on. Johansson conveys both her vulnerability and her cold alienness through subtle expressions and eye movements.

""Under the Skin"" is definitely not an average sci-fi movie -- it's an odd, weird, surrealistic piece that drifts between two cinematic styles. Definitely not for everyone, but also definitely worth a watch.",1419724800,2,4301,4.895604395604396

The whole film was nothing but our superficial depiction of beauty.  It works perfectly with Scarlett Johansson's character being an alien.  There is so much to this film and I would rate it as high as the movie Drive.  My other all time favorite film.

Through out the film Scarlett's character is doing a mission of abducting lonely men while at the same time observing humans.  In the beginning it was about trying to blend in and observing humans, which will also show how we perceive beauty.  She started off as cold and emotionless; unitl, she starts to interact more with humans.  She doesn't quite understand it at first but soon later finds the road to self-discovery.  Trying to understand herself.

I love movies like these where you are thinking most of the time and not have the film present the message clearly to you.  Audiences have high expectations for films these days and don't want to take the time to interpret.  The final portion of the film shows how most people see beauty.  We see the exterior of someone but when we see the person who they really are, we get scared and don't want anything to do with that person.

This film has a lot to offer if you take the time to interpret it.  No high octane action sequences or pointless dialogue.  It's a film on observation.",1419552000,10,1475,4.50188679245283

The middle section was more odd alien messing with dumb guys.  Then the ending switched back to how aliens humans are to each other.  The it's ending falls into mankind sucks territory.

6312857,4,B00J22YU62,"First off, if you're reading this review first for some reason, read it all before you decide if you want to read any more reviews before watching this film.

Okay, normally I don't watch films like this. The dark and creepy and weird stuff that is hard to grasp. That being said, I was intrigued and stuck with the whole thing.  I kept an open mind, and that was helpful.  This is not a movie that is any way 'normal'. You have to go into it knowing that.  This is not a movie that those looking for mainstream are going to enjoy.  This is a movie that moves along differently, that you have to pay close attention to, and one you will be thinking on long after.  Let me say that again. This is a 'thinking' movie.  It doesn't move at a fast action pace, doesn't lay things out for you, doesn't explain anything, doesn't give you answers.  You will leave this movie with questions, and you will have to draw your own conclusions to them.

I thought the movie was genius in many ways. The genius of it was in the 'thinking' of it.  You're not spoon-fed the story, you're given room to discover it, in your own way.  And the more you think on it after, and trust me, you'll think on it, the more you come to appreciate it.  It is subtle in an unusual way.  If you keep an open mind,  and go into it knowing it's odd and you'll have to wade your own way through it, you'll find an intriguing and thoughtful experience.  One you may find yourself repeating, to get even more out of it each time you watch.  This movie is not for everyone.  You need to know that you won't really know what's going on the whole time, and that it isn't really 'entertainment'.  If you still want to watch it, knowing that, then I would recommend doing so without reading any other reviews, because most of them contain spoilers.  If you want the most out of the experience, you'll want a clean one where you can come through it in your own way, untainted by the thoughts of others.  I read many reviews first, and while they can be helpful by giving away some of the storyline, I know they are not for everyone, because of the spoilers. In many ways, I wished I hadn't read them first.  It all really comes down to who you are and what you want to get out of this movie.",1419379200,,2248,4.217798594847775
6312858,4,B00J22YU62,"I liked it. The movie was very interesting and a unique take on the subject - alien race is ""feeding"" off us in some way and the chief agent discovers humanity and kindness (??) and goes rogue. That was my take on it. Not a ton of action and no 'splosions at all. No explanation as to what they are or what they are technically doing to us. Very little dialogue really.

6312882,2,B00J22YU62,"OK, This is going to be a tough movie to review because you never really know what the hell is going on. First off, I never read the book that this was based on. All that I knew going in was that it was a Sci Fi/Horror movie and that Scarlett Johannson does full frontal nudity in it. I KNOW. I also know that I will not be the only guy to see this film for that reason alone. Any way...here's the review. This movie is incredibly slow paced and just plain BORING. I fell asleep within the first 30 minutes of the film on two separate attempts to watch it. I finally made it all the way through on the third try and wondered why I bothered. The Scottish locales are all dismal gray and depressing. The characters are all one dimensional and boring. There is no explanation as to why Scarlett Johannson's character does what she does. I honestly can't fathom how this movie got a 6.9 rating on IMDB. That said, the movie is very unnerving and sets a surreal tone throughout. It just never delivers. Ms. Johannson turns in a fine performance, as always
 There's just no point to it. She utilizes all of her considerable talent to show ZERO range or emotion. It's mind boggling. I honestly think that she got tired of people constantly wanting to see her naked, so she decided to give them what they wanted. She also decided to make them suffer for it. By the time you get to the long awaited full frontal nudity, you start feeling like one of the poor saps that got lured into her character's trap in the movie. Maybe THAT is the point? Credit where credit is due. Through her performance and through the overall tone of the film, they managed to remove any sexuality or emotional punch from the nudity. You just feel uncomfortable with it. You finally get to see Scarlett Johannson nude, and you just don't care. It was a sad day. I guess in the grand scheme of things...Scarlett, if you have the talent to make me not care that you are on the screen completely nude, then you should be very proud of this performance.

The beginning is strange, in fact there are a lot of strange things in this movie, and some of which are never really explained. Every time I felt about ready to give up something else happened that piqued my interest enough to make me stick around. I mostly love Scarlett Johansson and this was one of her best performances in my mind. This movie moves slow and forces the you to pay attention. I suspect this has something to do with the poor ratings. Even though I figured out fairly quickly what Under the Skin was referring to and what she really was, it was still interesting to see how it all played out. I think perhaps the ending could have been a little more dramatic; again left with many unanswered questions but in my mind that isn't always a bad thing. Let's the view use his/her own imagination.

6312944,5,B00J22YU62,"This movie is impenetrable, confusing, and ultimately amazing.

Dozens of other reviewers have described the movie better than I ever could, so I'll only hit the main points - this movie has very little dialogue and a dreamy pace, and it's never immediately obvious what's happening at any given time. It's completely possible to watch the whole movie without even understanding what the premise is.

(Minor spoiler: in broad terms, the woman is an alien in human form whose mission is to seduce and incapacitate human men so that their bodies can be sent back to her home world and used for... something. This is made much clearer in Michel Faber's novel, but the film leaves it all so surreal and ambiguous that you might easily assume that the film's ""sci-fi"" elements are just psychedelic dream sequences.)

Under the Skin refuses to explain itself, but that's a good thing. The experience ends up being less like watching a movie and more like reading a challenging book - you know that all these components were created for a reason, so the imperative falls on you, the viewer, to piece them together and identify the ideas and meanings that lie under the skin (sorry).

This process is rewarding because, in terms of traditional ""film logic,"" Under the Skin DOES make sense. It took me two and a half viewings to work out some of the more ambiguous scenes, but I managed to come up with my own internal synopsis of the movie's key ideas and plot with only a minimal amount of ""active"" viewing. And yes, the film does have a plot - it's a sort of incidental French-New-Wave-type plot where the major events randomly spring from everyday happenstance, of course, but it has a linear progression and a beginning, middle, and end. The unifying element in these events is the woman's character development as she does her ""job"" while nurturing a growing fascination with the human world. Some reviewers seem not to have noticed this character development, and I think that's part of what makes the movie so great. Scarlett Johansson plays a character that is only shallowly familiar with human society. She can communicate, often well enough to manipulate the men around her, but she is confused by and obsessed with the shadowy parts of the human condition - mortality, friendship, and passion all fall outside the range of her experience, and she doesn't even know the appropriate social cues to use when confronted with them. How do you develop a character who lacks even the facial expressions needed to express herself? The answer is unclear, but it seems Johansson has figured it out. She is on-screen for most of Under the Skin's running time, and every minute you can almost hear the gears turning in her head as she comes to terms with the alien world around her. Apparently this effect is lost on some reviewers, but it remains my most powerful memory of the film.

Under the Skin is not an easy movie, but it's worth the effort you put into it. It's one of those rare sci-fi movies, like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Upstream Color, that pulls you into a dream-world where countless ambiguities and bits and bobs of surrealism congeal into a whole that feels timeless and mythic. I don't know what Under the Skin ""means,"" just as I'm still not sure what 2001 ""means,"" but the sheer talent and inspiration that are on display in the film allow the viewer to come up with his or her own meanings for it. And that's just amazing.",1419120000,7,3435,4.708818635607321

In my opinion this is one of the rare instances where the filmmaker's interpretation is far better than the original. So dark, mysterious, and beautiful that I have to rate it 5 stars, but my wife wouldn't watch 5 minutes. It's polarizing.",1419033600,,541,4.530612244897959
6312977,5,B00J22YU62,"Nine Things About the Movie Under the Skin

1. This is surely the strangest, most beautifully baffling film of 2014. It's visually poetic, existentially stunning, and impossible to describe.  I think it's brilliant and scary, though I don't know why. This is art that cuts below conscious thought and messes around inside you on the human level. It either speaks to you, or it doesn't; it has nothing to do with your intelligence.

2. It kind of has a plot. Scarlett Johansson plays a woman with the personality of an insect who wanders around Scotland, picking up solo men, and... makes things happen to them.

3. The movie is so abstract that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. I think it's supposed to be about some kind of inter-dimensional vampire alien thing. But this is not an action science fiction movie.

4. The movie could also be about a primitive force of nature that both distracts and consumes humanity.

5. Or it could be about the predatory nature of humans, and how men differ from women in what they're after.

6. There's relatively little dialogue in the movie - most of it is visual.  None of the characters even have names. Most of the characters were played by non-actors, and when they do talk, it was mostly unscripted.

7. The scene with Adam Pearson, the guy with neurofibromatosis in real life, stops you cold with its depiction of the unutterable, lonely intimacy of human relations.

8. This is a complete, perfect package of a film. From the surreal acting to the entrancing visuals, and the hauntingly unnerving soundtrack, you either take the whole thing or reject the whole thing.

9. I'm still not sure if the ending is happy or sad. Or if it even matters.",1418947200,,1697,4.68013468013468

It was basically, girl meets boy, girl takes boy to some extremely non-descript location, boy dies in giant black pool of ooze.  No emotions, no questioning as to why her prey willingly walked into a giant pool of muck without thinking it was strange, nothing.  The best part of the movie was the end when it was finally revealed what she was all along, but still I felt almost nothing, no remorse, and most of the time I sympathize with the anti-hero type character.  I didn't mind the long stretches without dialogue, but at least throw in a scene or two of utter terror when the guys arrive in her dark lair, an expression on one of their faces, a struggle, a look of pure disbelief, something.

6313075,4,B00J22YU62,"Overall, I liked this film but I was very tempted to stop watching it about 30 minutes in. I'm glad I didn't because I enjoyed the implications and subtleties of the film; however, that's also what I didn't like about the film. I spent a large portion of the film trying to answer open ended implications and questions the movie throws at you; I was really hoping for some more exposition around Johansson's  character (obviously later on I know she wasn't human but I wanted more details than that). Before watching this movie, I didn't realize it was an adaptation of a book with the same title by Michel Faber (of which I will probably end up reading for a more satisfying exposition/narrative). Bottom Line: you will either like or hate this movie, and those who hate it will probably stop watching it around the same 30 minute mark I mentioned earlier.

Pros:
Interesting Concept
Johannson gives stellar performance
Entertaining Overall (in my opinion)

Cons:
Weak Exposition
Multiple Interpretations due to the loose adaptation of the book
Very Minimal Dialogue

Conclusion: You should give it a try, those who want a linear narrative will be disappointed; those who are open minded will have a better chance of appreciating/liking the movie but its not a given.",1418688000,,1268,4.883720930232558

They know half of the people that should like it, will likely watch it on a day when they aren't ready to take it in and claim the director is too pretentious and self righteous for their own good. But for those that watch this and feel exactly what the folks behind the camera are going for, it's totally worth all the misunderstood negativity that it will inevitably stir up. Blessed are those high profile actors who lend their star power to something a studio or an investor might consider a less than profitable project in order to give visionary directors the opportunity to keep style and creative life pumping through modern cinema. Under the Skin is more important than the world is ready to give it credit for, but 20 years from now it's films like this that will give artists the courage to take the risks that are vital to the industry as an artistic medium.

6313094,5,B00J22YU62,"I glanced at the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and was surprised to see how many critics didn't get this movie. I loved it the moment it started: this is one of the lushest films I've seen in a long time; the cinematography--especially of the natural beauty of Scotland--was breathtaking. From the very beginning of the film, the music echoes swarms of bees or wasps on the attack. When Johansson first appears, removing the clothing  from the carcass of her predecessor, she picks up an ant on her fingertip and for one brief moment the camera zooms in on the ant; she observes it, perhaps feels some affinity with it...

Johansson plays what I would refer to as a drone: she is a worker whose job is to harvest human males for later consumption by her species. The guy on the motorcycle is obviously her superior/supervisor (and the one who cleans up after her when her prey's belongings are left on the beach). He buzzes around Scotland on his cycle and makes sure that all work is efficiently performed; toward the end of the movie, he and some cohorts try to catch up with the AWOL Johansson, but she has lost herself in the human world.

The expression on Johansson's face is exquisitely emotionless: she knows how to play human with her prey, but the rest of the time, her expression is devoid of anything but her focus on the hunt. This alien-insect-like quality is terrifying: I was amazed by the amount of cold-blooded focus she was able to express in her eyes.  However, after she sees herself in a mirror, she begins to inhabit her humanness more deeply: her range of genuine emotions begins to expand. She experiments with chocolate cake and human intimacy, releasing one of her victims and kissing a man who rescues her. But she is done in by the same sweet, sticky bait she uses on her victims: human sexuality.

Scotland is the perfect backdrop: breathtakingly beautiful images of nature are juxtaposed with the bustling human world of Glasgow and surrounding small towns. I enjoyed this movie more than anything I have seen in a long time because it has so much respect for my human intelligence and my understanding that we don't have to look beyond our own species to find insect-like predators in our midst. And I promised myself that soon I will go back to vegetarianism.",1418601600,,2289,4.669975186104218

Coming from someone who can watch Johansson iron clothes for 24 hours nonstop, she still couldn't save this movie.
It was just dull & boring & long & trying very hard to be strange.
oh so edgy the camera on some guy with a deformed face. yeah i really want to see that in HD.
oh a ton of random male frontal nudity for no reason. no thanks.

the music is actually good. too good for this movie. it was wasted on this film.
i will purchase the soundtrack.

In the end this could've just been an episode of tales from the Crypt.

development of feelings and understanding of herself was well-done over the length of the movie.

On the other hand, the movie seemed too long. It took me almost 50 minutes to get a feel for what was going on and there seemed a lot of dead
space in the plot's development during that time. While the men's capture was interesting, they were extremely stupid in ignoring the weirdness
of their surroundings inside the places she took them. Also, I was disappointed in the total lack of explantion of any of the context of what was going

In fairness, though, it does develop a true narrative later in the film in contrast to the first half which seems like purely a stylistic exercise.

It works pretty well as a defense of ""the hot girl"", even one who thinks she's in complete control and knows how to use men to her advantage.  However, there is really only one character who gets anything resembling depth, and hers is still mostly under the surface. It's a showcase for Johansson, who manages to own the screen and convey several different emotions with almost no dialogue and relatively little change in facial expression. Every other character is basically there to by symbolic, and offers no depth or insight. It's really slow and often really uncomfortable.

I couldn't figure out why it had so many negative reviews until I read some of them and realized that people don't want supernatural fiction to actually be *super*natural - they want exhaustive exposition. They want some ""expert"" character who can explain to the audience what's happening and why. They're impatient and lack the imagination to ask the why and how questions themselves. If you're interested in watching a supernatural horror movie that doesn't hold your hand and tell you what to think, then by all means, watch this. If you're boring and want everything spoon-fed to you, then you may want to move on.",1418515200,,970,5.031055900621118

6313175,4,B00J22YU62,"It it often said that science fiction uncovers more penetrating truths
about contemporary existence than most genres, especially documentaries
or so-called cinma-vrit films.

This is certainly the case with UNDER THE SKIN, whose title suggests
the film's principal aim. Director Jonathan Glazer tries to get under
the skin of what it is to be 'masculine' or 'feminine' in contemporary
post-industrial societies, and comes up with some rather depressing
answers.

The plot is straightforward: a mysterious woman (Scarlett Johansson)
comes from another planet and inhabits the person of a dead women.
Thereafter she seduces a succession of single men in Glasgow, Scotland.
At the beginning she simply absorbs them; but as the action unfolds she
begins to discover something about herself as well as the people she
encounters.

Shot in a series of lengthy takes with minimal dialogue, UNDER THE SKIN
is as much about ambiance as plot. We are exposed to a rough,
aggressive world of the inner city, where one-night stands are
commonplace and people show very little concern for one another's
welfare. It's always easier to beat someone up rather than try to
understand them. The girl's treatment of the various men serves to
perpetuate the status quo; she simply reverses the stereotype of the
aggressive male/ pliant female. Yet Glazer suggests that this is
something she is not especially aware of; as a visitor from another
territory, she believes this is the only way to behave. Environment
molds character.

As the action unfolds, however, so she begins to discover different
ways of responding to similar situations. This does not mean that the
plot ends happily; far from it. But at least she can understand the
power of self-determination - something that Glazer suggests is denied
to most of the Glaswegians she encounters on her odyssey through the
city.

In terms of visual style, UNDER THE SKIN is very reminiscent of
GRAVITY, with Daniel Landin's camera creating a dreamlike world of
garish colors and blurred edges. The film is as much a mental as a
physical journey for the central character. It could be argued that the
theme helps to perpetuate rather than question familiar stereotypes
(the girl's behavior suggests that she is part of the 'monstrous
regiment' of women, to be feared rather than understood), but Glazer's
laid-back narrative approach encourages us to reflect carefully on what
we see before us.",1418428800,,2425,5.144670050761421

6313216,4,B00J22YU62,"""Under the Skin"" is an intensely dark film that has very 'art house' film feel to it. Though not as ambiguous as other stereotypical art house films, it does borrow a lot from that medium. This film is sparsely populated with dialogue and uses its color-grading, lighting and  soundtrack/score to emote. I gave it a 4-star rating, because I do enjoy films like this, when made well.

Cinematically, the cinematography is both beautiful and stark combined with a soundtrack that lends well with the mood of the film and evokes the emotional content that is needed in each shot. This is extremely important in a feature with long static shots and such little dialogue.

As for the low rating by most other reviewers, I'd have to assume that it is more than likely due to an audience that doesn't quite understand 'art house' stylistics (and there's nothing wrong with that). Art house films cater to a very specific palette that is often based on interpretations of aesthetics, symbolism and the evoking of an emotional response. This film is no different from these types of films with exception of using the three act structure, which is not a requisite of art films. One could argue that such a structure is the antithesis of an art film. But then again, isn't that placing a structure on art films?

Anyway, I digress. Scarlett Johansson performance is fantastic, even though she's plays a very, purposefully, flat and dry character. There are quite a bit of moments that are left unexplained throughout and could reveal another reason for an overall low rating, but personally I think that's part of the charm (if you take it as an art film).

As a father, no, as a decent human being, I can't stand for this sort of thing being depicted in any fashion. Personally, I don't care if the movie were about a woman murdering men. What I never want to see in a movie is an INFANT being purposefully stranded and left for dead or murdered in a film.

That was some pretty sick crap and as a father, it about made me have an anxiety attack, and this is coming from a man that has served in Iraq without a single issue of anxiety.

6313280,3,B00J22YU62,"In 'Under The Skin', Director Jonathan Glazer presents an uncommon mix of sci-fi, horror, and avant-garde for the film viewer. Scarlett Johansson plays the primary in this story with no point of reference other than it obviously takes place in Scotland. The script plays out in the sparsest way possible with a number of elements inferred, but unexplained. Some of the imagery is unique and interesting, but some of this is also quite disturbing - especially the scene at the beach. There is also very little dialog, so Johansson has her work cut out for her in that she is in nearly every scene and must convey a lot while saying very little. Unfortunately, all this minimalism undercuts what could have been a much richer story. There is no sense of a narrative here, only a series of scenes laid out in a seemingly chronological order that focus on Johansson's character. 'Under The Skin' leaves the viewer with more questions, which I suppose was the creators' intention. If you enjoy off-beat films that refuse to follow the standard 'Hollywood' model, you might consider this film.

6313314,4,B00J22YU62,"There is a strangeness to 'Under the Skin' that most movies don't dare to even approach. But here, that quality is precisely the point.

I remember reading Michel Faber's novel 'Under the Skin' years ago. It was the first of Faber's books I had read (though I've since read all his others), and I remember being struck by the feeling throughout the book that I never felt quite comfortable while turning its pages. For quite a long time, I didn't know what was really going on, though I knew there was something there beneath the surface, and it was bound to be something interesting. In this, I was not at all disappointed. The film version makes the ambitious attempt - and a mostly successful one - to match this feeling. Even having read the book, there wasn't a time when this film didn't feel strange, when the everyday things we see (a bustling intersection, a shopping mall, a dance club) don't come through the lens as something other than what we know. And certainly, there are scenes that left me positively mystified, and fascinated.

One of the things I remember writing about Faber's book is that ""he doesn't rush,"" and this is one of many ways the movie matched the tone of the book almost perfectly. 'Under the Skin' is a film that takes its time, that steeps itself like a rich tea in hot water, with lingering shots and moments drawn out to the breaking point. Often the camera focuses on Scarlett Johansson's face or body, so much so that I almost forget it was her, and I'm caught up, as she is, in the angle of her jawline or the space between her eyes or the curve of her calf. Her performance in the film is distant and curious, unlike anything else I've seen her do, and it adds to the overall weird quality. The music, too, creates a strange counterpoint to what's happening onscreen, sometimes a slow, steady beat, sometimes a wailing, distorted string instrument, never what you might expect. This is a sensual film, filled with moments surprising and strange, often deceptively simple, sometimes shockingly new. But it never rushes.

As you've probably read in other reviews, this isn't a movie for everyone. It can seem too slow in places, it leaves more questions open than it answers, there's precious little dialogue to explain what's happening, and sometimes it feels disjointed and non-linear. These are hard hurdles to overcome, especially for audiences that are accustomed to being spoon-fed with clear signs of what is and is not important.  There are no color codes or obvious musical cues in 'Under the Skin' to tell you what matters. Instead, it's the details. Another thing I wrote about Faber's book that holds true for the film is that the questions it asks are implicit. Nobody asks them outright, there's no big debate between characters about the nature of what's going on. The film's questions are asked subtly, through action and inaction, and their answers are not always clear.

For those willing to take the chance, however, 'Under the Skin' does reward you for your effort. There's a moment at the end when there's a relief - an understanding. It's not an ""ah-ha!"" moment, it's more like a ""yes...of course."" A sigh, a clarity. 'Under the Skin' is not a conventional film, it's not a comfortable film, and it's not an easy film. At times, I had a hard time watching it. At others, I was captivated, even though I didn't completely understand what was happening. It uses a language of images and sound to convey a message - not always clear, but almost always compelling. I'll quote myself on Faber's novel one more time, because this also holds true for the film: ""By the simple persuasion of its elegant language, it made me question a great deal of what I believed to be real and reliable.""

Simply put, 'Under the Skin' is one of the few times you'll have the chance to see us through other eyes.",1417996800,,3851,4.672566371681416

6313319,5,B00J22YU62,"Every so often, while watching ""Under the Skin, I would ""pause/stop"" the film in utter amazement, so as to appreciate, elongate and ""savor"" what I had just experienced and witnessed; knowing it might be a decade or even longer before I would be ""treated"", availed and/or exposed to such a brilliant and masterfully done film and score!!  This movie was simply fabulous!  At around the film's mid-point, and there after each time I paused it..........my enjoyment, excitement and bliss for the movie/story had grown.  But I also noticed and felt a growing sadness and a sort of impending doom.  For with each successive pause of the film - I couldn't help or refrain from glancing and noticing the # of minutes left/remaining kept dwindling!  I did not want this movie (dream) to end!  Once experienced, it's gone and done; as it will never be cloned or copied.

The ""location"" used to make and shoot the film (expansive, long/wide range scenes, visuals, etc.)......along with the ""weather"" (cold, wet, fog, etc.).....was sheer genius and magnificent!  You can be certain that every angle, element, detail - involving the production, direction, filming of this movie - was very carefully considered and mastered.  This film was congruent and true to itself.  It is (was) what it is.  It was not Hollywood, and was not made to please the ""Top 40"" pedestrian crowd.  Each shot, scene was brilliantly created/crafted to slowly build and compound the suspense.  And I'm not quite sure how or why they worked and ""fit"" so well, but the use of those ""motorcycles"", and the manner they were driven and filmed, was extraordinary!  The sound and music (score) was sensational throughout the movie.

Those who crave control, interpret and/or see everything in life as ""black or white"" and abhor any ""grey""; they will probably not appreciate ""Under the Skin"".  And some of them may vehemently despise it!  Whenever I see wild extremes/differences in ratings and reviews, it's an almost certain indication that I'm going to like it, or at least ""check it out"".  If I personally don't care for it, I'm happy for those who do.  I'm thankful for and celebrate those that are different and don't always like or agree with me.  For I am often wrong and sometimes need help, for there are many things that I either do not ""like"" to do and/or am not good at.

6313355,5,B00J22YU62,"""Under the Skin"" is a rare cinematic accomplishment - a perfect visual treat that eschews explanation or explication and relies solely on the visual narrative, trusting the viewer to make sense of the story. It seamlessly melds the guerrilla tactics of documentary and found footage with fully realized, polished cinematography. The unscripted scenes in the vehicle, using hidden cameras, appear fully integrated into the more conventionally staged scenes.

The minimalism will appeal only to fans of movies like 2001, Koyaanisqatsi, Man Facing Southeast, Man With a Camera, and The Driver. Director Jonathan Glazer's work here is as different from his earlier cult hit ""Sexy Beast"" as Walter Hill's ""The Driver"" was from ""Last Man Standing"".

Director of photography Daniel Landin describes some of the technique and collaborative approach in interviews. The movie was made just before the affordable small HD and 4k Black Magic cameras were available, so the crew had to make their own concealable HD cameras for the vehicle scenes: (http://www.indiewire.com/article/how-dp-daniel-landin-captured-scarlett-johanssons-alien-nature-in-under-the-skin)

It looks and sounds great.  Any frame can be grabbed at random and you'll have a powerful still photograph.  Great care was taken to provide adequate lighting for a lush cinematic effect, while remaining as unobtrusive as possible to preserve the intent to take the viewer on a journey that unfolds as the main character experiences it.  It feels like a documentary without voiceover narrative, but looks like a feature film.

Under the Skin is not for impatient audiences who need spoken explanations of everything that happens, or scrolling text back stories. And while the occasionally nekkid ScarJo looks fantastic, she portrays a predatory, manipulative, not quite human character with all the allure of a lioness preying on warthogs.  There is nothing sexy about the nude scenes. She turns the manipulative charm on and off like a switch - it's absolutely unnerving to watch, and completely improvised for each scene. It's her strongest performance yet, and what little dialog there is was unscripted and improvised to suit each encounter with the non-actors, who were drafted into the final cut of the movie only after each scene was shot.",1417910400,,2298,5.527065527065527

It possesses an unparalleled ability to dissuade me from allowing a particular individual to choose or otherwise affect movie viewing decisions.  I have to say, a long conversation with a painted wall might be more . . . interesting?  Illuminating?  Poignant, perhaps?  There is one difficulty a viewer may have with this film, and that is that it provides no context whatsoever by which to interpret the imagery and sounds that occur.  However, if context is irrelevant for you--when it comes to the act of interpreting stimuli that you experience in your environment then this may not be a problem for you.  If you are the type of person who will look at an old postcard and suddenly realize that it is a commentary on Hegelian philosophy as applied to post-war pre-modernism then perhaps not watching this movie would as stunning a social statement as watching it--because if context and content are not required to give rise to interpretation, then . . . wanton nudity.

6313423,3,B00J22YU62,"Alright, this is a slow sci fi. Slow and dry. It is no better or worse than most of the pod people / body snatcher style films.

I personally had to break this up into 3 sessions, the pace was miserably slow through most of the film. There are a handful of really shocking and funny moments.

Spoiler: We follow the semi-sentient appendages of an alien life form, particularly we follow the female bait. Like an angler fishes glowing bulb she exudes sexuality to draw in victims. At a certain point the appendage becomes far more self aware and in a fashion rebels. The appendage sinks deeper into humanity. The alien reacts to try and find its stray hand (apparently it has a problem with female appendages, since it was likely a failed female appendage at the start of the film). In the end humanity does what it normally does when it encounters something it can't understand.

If you are nerdy enough to be familiar with the Palladium Role Playing Game, you might draw really strong parallels to the way many of the entity organisms function in the game. She is simply a fragment of the entity, potentially one of many.

I really haven't given much away and I won't spoil the ending if you can stay awake to get there. I personally saw it as a decent watch, but not ground breaking or spectacular. Some skin, some enticement, lots of waiting for something to happen. There are observations on humanity and basically the old joke of 'men think with their peckers' is the biggest point it tries to hammer home.",1417651200,,1511,4.564575645756458

I also wished for more info on her relationship to the motorcycle guys.  Same type of being?, same level of knowledge or control?, or was she more of a controlled servant?
The synopsis of the novel is no help, because the movie appears to depart far from it (or at least is only a narrow focused part of that, without the context, cannot confirm if she is like the woman in the novel, or different).
However, on reflection of the movie, it kept me focused on every detail (if only to try and figure out these missing details), and visually made it feel like this could be going on right in my own town, never to be suspected.  For the fact it kept my attention and still has be thinking about it, and who she was, I could give it 5-star, so I settled in between on 4.)

It's utterly boring and frankly shows no talent in the field of directing. Anyone could do this - and has. Had he shot one or two long scenes to establish the mood he wished it might have worked, but dragging almost every scene in the movie on and on with barely a sound or action turns watching this flick into absolute drudgery. It kills any contribution the actors might have made. It feels like he is trying to fill the 149 minutes of this movie and lacks imagination to come up with something.

Then there are some other dudes riding around on motorcycles for no reason, while some s***ty wanna be close encounters atmospheric music plays in the background.

Not sure if the director of this movie has naked pictures of Scarlett Johanson's mom or how she was talked into this crap, but this has set the bar of bad.

I don't know if that is from the original photography, or due to the transfer. But it was like looking at an almost totally black screen much of the time. Scarlett Johansen plays a young woman in search of men that have no social ties. When she finds them, she ""makes them disappear."" That's pretty much the entire plot. You never really know why or what the point is. The movie has almost no dialog. What little dialog there is, is just the woman asking questions to verify that the men have no friends or family. I watched the whole thing. I kept thinking that, eventually, they would have to make some kind of sense. But it never does. I suspect that a final scene at the end is supposed to tell you what was going on. But I guess that I'm too obtuse. It still seemed pointless to me.

6313493,1,B00J22YU62,"I always try to be fair when expressing an opinion about a persons film or written material. Having an MFA in Film Production will cause me to go overboard sometimes in these circumstances, or be insensitive, or arrogant, or simply pissy. In my life, I have walked out of one film because it was so bad. That film was 'Showgirls', and I won't go into the gory details here.

However as a filmmaker I always make a truly sincere effort to watch someone's work all the way through, because I understand how bloody difficult it is to not only start and then make a project, but to actually complete it.

For 'Under the Skin', I could only hold on for 53 minutes. No more. I told myself, 'c'mon, only 36 minutes to go -- you can do it!'

I could not do it.

It amazes me that money was raised and time was spent in pre-production, post-production, and even marketing this film -- this personal vision -- this story. The first human dialogue is heard about 22 minutes into the film. This is 'film-speak' that can be translated as 'Hey don't get upset! Don't leave the theatre yet! This is an ART FILM.' I have nothing against art films, but 'Under the Skin' does not fall into that particular category.

There is no story. There are no 'acts'. There are no plot points. There is no direction (not a director directing actors or the DP to do something, but rather, the story has absolutely no story direction and no purpose in being). And for the life of me I cannot find a personal message, or the writer/director's vision, or even a valid reason why this film was made.

There is some good acting within the piece (alas not by Ms. Johansson), but that is the best I can say. This film (and for sure 'Showgirls') is a specific example of why Amazon needs to be able to have a film rating of NO STARS. Not one star, not 1/2 of a star. NO STARS.

Spending the 89 minutes to watch this piece could be better spent planting a garden, creating an ant farm, cutting your toenails, or merely watching the clouds in the sky. Any activity would be better. Anything.",1417478400,,2051,4.381578947368421

Scarlet Johansson is compelling in this role and the visuals in the sci-fi 'mud', where her victims end up is amazingly simple, but incredibly eerie! It's not a movie it is an experience. The first 5 minutes of the movie are incredible, it is for your interpretation alone, and that leads me to my summing up of 'Under the Skin', it is what ever you want it to be, viewer participation is essential.

6313551,3,B00J22YU62,"""Under the Skin"" merits a differential rating system- one for aesthetics and production value, and a separate one for writing and acting.  A mildly challenging and frequently disturbing film, Under the Skin is a showcase for director Glazer's gift of creating an ominous and serene mood with spare cinematography, and a muddy and droning soundtrack

You can read the plot details elsewhere but anyone expecting a riveting portrayal by Scarlett Johansson will be sorely disappointed.  Not unlike her character in ""Lucy"", Johansson stares blankly into space 3/4 of the time, doing a listless imitation of blank wall (which will probably inspire most viewers to similarly stare at the screen).  Only when she picks up the gentleman with neurofibromatosis does she start to exhibit some semblance of real emotion (not much), but by this time the die is cast and the movie plods along in an emotional state of suspended animation.

""Under the Skin"" is nevertheless a stark, somewhat poignant look at how extraterrestrial outsiders might view our species.  It is beautifully filmed and creates a superb, unrelenting mood. However, the scant writing and dialog, and the wooden performance of Johansson limits the extent to which it can be taken seriously.  Well worth a few hours- just don't expect any revelations.

One note: Comparisons to Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" are worthy but shouldn't be taken too literally.  While it certainly owes an homage to Eraserhead, it comes off as an extremely lite version.  Eraserhead was spare, shockingly inventive, and offputting, whereas Under the Skin is a more conventional and arty take on Lynch's seminal film.",1417392000,,1643,5.236641221374046

I found the film a very surprising turn from Jonathan Glazer's previous films such as the stylish and brutal yet, conventional neo-noir Sexy Beast. Balanced despite a very wide contrast of bleak, alienating scenery and vivid, alien imagery.",1417305600,2,542,5.2298850574712645

I haven't read the book, so I felt like I was playing catch up on the story line.

The cinematography is stunning and Johansen's work is as wonderful as her beauty but the movie never really succeeds. If you decide to give this film a try I'd suggest reading a synopsis of the book of the same name (there's a good one on Wikipedia) because it will give you an idea of what's happening.

Of course, I am a big fan and may be somewhat biased. While the plot seems rather simple on the surface (a mysterious woman picking up men and pulling them into some underworld) it kept me glued to the screen to see what would happen next and how it would turn out. I must say they did an interesting job of turning her into an unfeeling, unemotional creature into a very human one. Very surrealistic in many settings, dominated by rather creepy music, and at times had me staring at the screen in utter confusion, it was worth the free watch as a Prime member. Now I am not sure if I would recommend purchasing a rental on this, unless your really into something off the wall. Fans of Cronenberg and Lynch might enjoy.

Scarlett has, along with other attributes many find attractive, real acting ability.  Nothing herein challenged it, but it is evident.

Aside from the vivid (albeit bleak) color that is used in the cinematography, there is little to distinguish the feel of the movie.  As I sat watching the film and listening to its' soundtrack, I felt a) boredom and b) annoyance.  This film's soundtrack and production design are 90%+ ripped off from David Lynch's ERASERHEAD and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Yes, I realize surrealistic films were around prior to the party days of 1967, but this film is so obviously the equivalent of an 9 year old kid who wants to be his older brother.  This film has no distinct identity of its own aside from the use of color that's missing from 2001 and is null in ERASERHEAD.  Oh, and it's got a famous actress who gets naked on screen.  Oooh.  Yeah.  The story is good, supposing one can trust what they read on Amazon, but I didn't get far enough into this film to personally verify that because the story apparently doesn't make itself known until the end(ish) of the film and by that point...there is no point...",1417219200,,1111,4.515

6313665,5,B00J22YU62,"I have only read a few of the reviews, but it appears that this movie is doing something that is totally lost on most people who see it. There are two key differences between this film and the book: 1) it is a film and 2) ""Scarlett Johansson""**.  That is, this is a film that is about film, film-making and acting-especially as carried out by the celebrity actress-all in the guise of ""science fiction"".

Let's start with the star since that is why most people probably bothered walking in to the theater.  ""Scarlett Johansson"" is the only name to show up in the opening of the movie. That marquee placement is the first hint that the film is perhaps ultimately about something other than what it appears on face-or we should say skin-value to be about.  Essentially Scarlett Johansson plays an alien that inhabits the body of a human woman. That is she-""Scarlett Johansson""-inhabits a character who is doing something quite analogous to what an actor/actress does: take on someone else's skin. The film clearly and intentionally uses Scarlett Johansson's name, face and body (yes there is more than a bit ""revealed"") as a form of attraction (in terms of drawing viewers) that has it's rather disturbing analogous practice in the film. And I suspect that ultimately the film is intending to say something about ""Scarlett Johansson"": that is, about celebrity and it's role in Hollywood's operations and our culture's obsessions.

A key practice in the making of this film was that a number of the scenes shot in public were done so with hidden cameras without extras.  Perhaps most centrally are the scenes where Scarlett Johansson is driving around in a van looking for and picking up potential ""victims"".  Part of what is fascinating about this is that these real people apparently did not recognize the celebrity actress.  And they climbed into a van driven by a total stranger most likely because of her physical attractiveness.  Not all that different than why we walked into the theater.

One of the most compelling sections of the film is one of the scenes shot in the van, but this one involves the actor Adam Pearson who has neurofibromatosis.  The irony of Pearson's involvement here is that he is not wearing a disguise: his physical ""disfigurement"" places him in the position of an ""alien"" in relation to conventional human expectations.  It is his interaction with the alien Johansson that leads to her ""conversion"".  That is, up until that part of the film she operates with absolutely no evidence of any ethical / moral concern (at least in relation to humans).  Following her interaction with Pearson she stumbles (rather obviously at one point) into a kind of conscience.

The latter part of the film depicts the alien unmoored from her task yet lacking any sort of understanding of what to do.  Ironically when the possibility of real sex (the promise of which she has used as her means of attraction) occurs she is horrified by it.  And it is the possibility of real violent sex that is her undoing.

The more I think about this film the more it feels like a critique of how film functions in our (I'm speaking as an american) culture.  That is, we are drawn into a sensation based entertainment enterprise that has as it's prime goal to attract us in order to consume us or at least our money.  Not in a way that is any more nefarious than that of the alien Scarlett Johansson plays: she doesn't seem to have any obvious evil intention: in her eyes we're no more than flies.

...

** In putting ""Scarlett Johansson"" in quotation marks I am intending to identify her celebrity persona as opposed to the actual person who is Scarlett Johansson.  This persona is a construction-by the media, by Hollywood and by the public-that may or may not bear a resemblance to the ""true"" Scarlett Johansson.  The genius of casting her in this role is that she is so famous that it is impossible for most viewers to see her as anything but the persona ""Scarlett Johansson"".  In the film this ""Scarlett Johanson"" inhabits the body of an anonymous woman (who looks just like one of the most famous actresses in the world); that is, we never know anything about the person whose body she is inhabiting.  Further ""Scarlett Johansson"" is playing an alien (who is inhabiting the body of an unknown woman) about whom we know virtually nothing.  At the end of the film we get a sort of cryptic glance of the alien within, but it is rather nondescript.  As such, while an actress is typically playing a character with some sort of history, in this case we have Scarlett Johansson playing ""Scarlett Johansson"" playing an anonymous alien ""playing"" an anonymous human.  Convoluted, but it seems to support the idea that this film is not what it appears to be when one just looks at it's skin.",1417219200,5,4783,4.722021660649819

Scarlett Johanson naked playing an alien luring men back to their doom. There could not or should not be any possible way to mess this up. Even the oddly pretentious art house way they made this thing, by simply having Ms. Johanson go out in Scottland and pick up real random men, without revealing who she was, or that it was a film, is interesting with the potential for brilliance.

Which makes the end result all the more sad. This is not the movie you are expecting to see. In fact the movie you are expecting to see would by any rational assessment be very very good. This is not that movie. This is the other movie. Poorly lit, incoherent sound and dialogue. Poorly shot. Lousy script. All mixed with a deep veneer of pretentious Art house meaning to try and convince you what you are watching is some deep exploration of something or other. Don't be fooled. All it is exploring is how many gullible fools will pay for any movie featuring Scarlett Johanson unclothed. The movie is at its best incomprehensible and boring.

Did you ever notice how long you yourself stand staring when your thinking out a solution to a situation? Yes that's right when your thinking for 30 seconds or even 1 minute, it goes by in no time, but when you wait for someone else to think it takes forever. That is exactly what is happening in this movie, she is busy thinking about _ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ (you fill in the blanks).  This movie gives you partial control of the story.

6313744,4,B00J22YU62,"I would have to agree with many of the reviewers on this movie, but I am firmly on the side that it is a intriguing film. It is slow, and at times I kept wanting to turn it off, but it got 'under my skin' and thus I watched it until the end. I really liked the movie, especially toward the middle when the pace picks up and the main character begins to 'flesh' out and become more complex and thus for me, more sympathetic. I was turned off initially at the callousness that was displayed by the two main characters towards the baby, but then when she demonstrated incredible compassion toward the man with a disability I was hooked.

I can't say that I would watch this movie again, but it definitely made me want to read the book. No movie is ever going to be as good to anyone as the book, because when we read a book we create a universe of images and characters that is unique to us and the film projects a universe and characters that is unique to the director based upon his/her reading of that book. I don't think that 'dinging' a movie based on this is fair, as it is akin to comparing apples to oranges.

That said, I like it but will admit it is not everyone's cup of tea and if you need action, lots of dialogue, and a clearly defined premise that is revealed early in the movie, then this isn't the film for you. If you are familiar with and like art films like ""Orpheus"" by Jean Cocteau or ""The Seventh Seal"" by Ingmar Bergman, then this movie will probably appeal to you.",1416960000,,1486,4.1923076923076925

6313747,4,B00J22YU62,"Under the Skin is a remarkable film that will be underappreciated by most. The protagonist, played by Scarlett Johansson, is essentially a tool for her species, serving only one purpose, which is to lure men to their deaths.

Seemingly human, she initially appears to be a sociopath, showing no real regard for the people around her. In predator mode, with an almost robotic demeanor, she targets young men who have no real ties to family or community.

While in pursuit to fulfill her mission, she meets a disfigured man who awkwardly accepts her unusual invitation. Unexpectedly feels compassion for this man, and she releases him. At that point, she becomes more self-aware & questions who she really is.
Confused, she stands alone on a foggy, Scottish highway, hoping to end the confusion & her existence. When no vehicles appear, she succumbs to an alternative & attempts to learn what it is to be human.

When those experiences seem to fail, she flees into the woods, seeking solitude.  Unfortunately, she soon learns that predators are not species specific.

Regardless of her species, our protagonist is originally controlled by males, & sadly her fate is eventually sealed by one.",1416960000,,1189,5.0152284263959395

What finally made me turn it off was three scenes with two different babies about 18 months old.  These babies were crying in these scenes so hard they were close to vomiting.  I hate to see children subjected to this kind of abuse  just to make a movie. Dont get me wrong, they were not BEING abused in the movie.  No one was physically hurting them.  One child was left alone at the beach as its parents drowned.  It was sitting on rocks on the shore and crying its little heart out.  That scene started in the daytime and went into a night shot with it still sitting there alone and crying.  You have to wonder how long did it take to shoot these scenes and how long did that crying go on. Babies can't act and cry on demand so this was the real deal.

Certain things...scratch that IMPORTANT THINGS aren't explained, and the filming overall seemed like it was a tourist that did it with a new HD camera.

The best part as selfish as this sounds was seeing her naked. I know, nothing new, but it was nice to see. I'm just sad I had to slog through the film to see it. Blech!.

It's unfortunate that those who don't understand the film or clearly make any attempt to understand it write such negative reviews. It's as if they tasted one flavor of chocolate, had a bad experience then wandered around condemning any candy in general.

Researching the film on the internet and going back to reviews of the time the film scored four and five stars by many critics who's business it is to know good films from bad and have made their careers doing so. The director of the film has made some of the best films to hit the cinema such as 'Sexy Beast' and 'Birth'. It's also scored an 86% approval rating on the rotten tomatoes dot com website. Clearly it's won over substantially more than the few on Amazon that provide uninformed and uneducated reviews.
It also beat Captain America: Winter Soldier when they opened on the same weekend. Scarlett Johannson starred in both.

I'm going back to watch this one again a few times, it's just that good of a film. Might have to pick it up on Blu Ray too.

Scarlett Johnson does a perfect job. And the hidden cameras filming unwitting extras in some scenes adds an extraordinary realism. The very, beginning is confusing and I almost turned it off, but stick with it. This film delivers.",1416787200,,528,4.866666666666666

When the movies starts out (this is not really a spoiler) it just shows a dot in the middle of the screen. It gets larger and brighter and then transforms into different shapes. This took forever - it was a blaring red flag that hinted at how the rest of the movie would play out. A red flag that, much to my chagrin, I ignored. There was minimal dialogue throughout the movie, and very long periods where there was no talking at all.

However, your sense is vague to the point of being only a tiny relief that they inexplicably avoided the dreary bloodless slaughters other characters experienced.  Other than that, we have no reason to care about anything that anyone does so long as they do it quickly thus hastening the end of the movie.

6313953,3,B00J22YU62,"I deliberated several days over how I felt about this movie, and in the end I'm still on the fence.

On the one hand, it is visually gorgeous and cinematically accomplished. You see Scarlett's character both in close ups and from very far away, when she is just a moving speck across a landscape. The camera work is effective at establishing and controlling mood as it fills the screen with a riot of color at times or a void of black the next moment, and incredibly soft whites and grays at others. The cinematography is stunning of itself, but it also helps construct the narrative--what narrative there is--by letting the viewer get a sense of what earth's environment must feel like to ***SPOILERS*** an alien creature. And the textures and contrasts on display are a treat in themselves.

I was also moved by Scarlett's performance as the ***SPOILERS*** increasingly alienated alien hunter, soon hunted itself. The climactic image of the movie made me sad--something I wasn't expecting.

But on the whole, the story never quite comes together and there is little, beyond the above, that remains of it once the watching is over. Unlike the best Kubrick movies, which I think this has been compared to, it is not something I feel compelled to watch again. The horror is dark as an abyss, but because we are never allowed to understand the alien intelligence that creates it, we cannot fully grasp what's at stake. Compare to The Shining, which is like your darkest nightmare of being hunted and finding no escape: we understand the horror of the Jack Nicholson character, as opaque as his madness is, because many of us have experienced human extremes of anger and insanity, whether in our own environments or reported in the news... somehow we get it, and even the supernatural element feels earned. In Under the Skin, by contrast, all remains an enigma, including the most basic questions about why these aliens go to the trouble of doing what they do and why we should care at all. In the end, all that's worth watching is Scarlett's turn in this role, and even that is kind of slight.

I'd still recommend you watch and make up your own mind. Definitely enjoy the visuals, if nothing else.",1416700800,2,2196,4.7408376963350785

6313980,5,B00J22YU62,"This is a very stylized Science Fiction film. No, make that - This is a very, VERY stylized Science Fiction film. I liked it, I admit that up front. However, I can completely understand another viewer's puzzlement, even rejection of it. One of the results of this kind of film-making is that the audience cannot identify with any character, and in fact is kept at a distance from the characters, like a stage set
with a scrim between the audience and performers. Why did the director make such a choice? I suppose to emphasize this is a harsh, unrelenting view of an extraterrestrial life form in our midst. The ETs need something from us humans and must kill us to get it. Yes, it is an unrelenting scenario, but the director fulfills his vision with brilliance and integrity. Scarlett Johansson, who has proven her ingratiating charm in a variety of films, reinvents herself as an ET who apparently gains insight and compassion for human beings and tries to escape from her murderous mission. But she is always an ET disguised as a human being - the film never goes soft, sentimentality is nowhere in sight. I admire Scarlett Johansson for playing the truth of this character, even if that truth will alienate part of the audience. Her closing scene, however, is simply and eloquently heartbreaking. And it is all conveyed through action and expression. There is no dialogue that explains things. She builds her character scene after scene and the cumulative effect is deeply moving and disturbing in equal measure. The film is set in an autumnal Scotland, and much of the natural setting in forests or moors is strikingly beautiful. The photography and Scarlett Johansson's utterly committed performance recommend this film highly in my estimation.",1416528000,,1751,4.918918918918919

The film Under the Skin is based on the book of the same name, but with significant artistic differences. The book has plot detail which underscores many finely taken social criticisms and ironies of modern life. The film, alternatively, is a catalyst for wide-ranging imaginative speculation for the viewer, across wild spectrum of philosophical and psychological speculation about the human condition. It is an amazing ride for the thinking viewer with its palate drawn from both natural settings and from a brave, finely conceived and subtle performance by Scarlett Johansson. Sexuality is only one (perhaps minor) theme among many others in the film, and the very clinical use of nudity, the lack of explicable external action and the meditative pace of the cinematography may leave more conventional viewers frustrated and bored.
Like 2001, a film to which some comparison is appropriate, the dialogue is basically irrelevant. Visually, however, the film is spectacular. Special effects are sparingly used as a stand-in for what is not natural but both the human/urban and the wilderness backdrops in Scotland are exquisitely chosen and mined for maximum symbolic and emotional effect.

6314007,4,B00J22YU62,"Undeniably unique and worth-it weird. Here's that rarest of horror/sci-fi films: no cliches. That's really something.

Add visually exquisite to all that, and allow yourself the shift down to a much slower pace  so you can walk into this all-bets-are-off realm. Not to mention, it's Scotland.

Moments of intriguing to shocking hyperrealism and potent wild nature scenes unroll from a glacially paced anti-story. The horror sneaks up on you at this pace, and it's pleasant that way. Ventures beyond even spooky David Lynch territory in INLAND EMPIRE, though the visual grammar has nothing to do with that film. Visually, this film is so beautiful and hypnotic, I don't think I'll ever forget it. It affected me as something completely unique, much as the unclassifiable surreal suspense film DONNIE DARKO.

Don't watch this if you just guzzled a Red Bull, because what shows up on the screen requires giving it up to a different rhythm that you're not going to fall into if you're over-caffeinated. Got kids? Wait for them to go to sleep. These are slow adult scare pleasures. There's also a great deal of full frontal male nudity, for a changeup of a whole other sort. Did I mention it's Scotland?

Through the Scarlett Johannson character's eyes, everything is strange, and director Jonathan Glazer succeeds in powerfully unifying different scenic textures making the familiar urban landscape, the chilly seashore, and wild woods all look menacingly beautiful, full of an unnameable force.

So many women and girls are disappearing every day in our walking around reality, it was interesting to watch that horrible state of affairs get changed up a bit, and yet...I was just a little sad to see the way the last act unfolded.

Highly recommended if you're tired of space operas, space zombies, space jails, and too many movies made to look exactly like the familiar blow-up-everything style of gaming for teens.

Big surprises in the sound track as well...music and audio enthusiasts will get a whole other sort of thrill from what's done here. Took me a few moments to determine how the arresting compositions were done.

6314060,4,B00J22YU62,"Stephen Hawking, when asked about extraterrestrials, once opined that he believed it would be very risky making contact with them.  After all, when Europeans first arrived in the New World, it didn't work out so well for the Native Americans, as an example.

This position is logically valid, due to the fact and it's implications, that space is so huge.  The farthest we've been able to travel so far is just outside of our known solar system -- and that is only with unmanned missions -- which in the big scheme of things is but a blip.  Our galaxy is about 100,000 light years across, after all.  If some civilization were able to reach us, they would be far more intelligent than we are; they couldn't get here if they weren't.  And intelligence and psychopathy are only loosely coupled, so even when they are so smart it doesn't mean they'll be so nice.

And psychopathy is explored a bit here.  Without much of a spoiler, Scarlett Johansson is some type of extraterrestrial, of unknown origin, and anything bad that ""she"" does is done without morality.  ""She"" is in quotes, because while watching, you will realize that someone's sex, from a universal standpoint, is somewhat arbitrary.  She is not psychopathic in any way, but rather, she is just like a spider who spins its web to catch prey so that it can eat and spin for another day.  From her perspective, there is nothing ""good"" nor ""bad"" in what she does, and this is a hugely important distinction and idea here.

This film reminds me a bit of ""Cloud Atlas,"" and while not being quite that ambitious, ""Under the Skin"" (UTS) sure tries hard.  I gave that film a 4 as well, and in a review I discussed its Big Ideas, as I felt it made some assertions but also asked some difficult questions of the viewer.  This film is similar, in the sense that it asks questions such as:  ""What is innate to life?  Are some things strictly mechanical, and so they come naturally?""  Also, ""Is morality learned?  Just by living, does a life-form begin to feel empathy towards other beings, or is this some built-in truth to the Universe?""

The cinematography is at times beautiful; note in particular the body of water with fog rolling over.  That scene really was quite impressive.  Another scene shows a camera pointed to the heavens, where that camera slowly is covered in snow.  And much has been made of Ms. Johansson and her ""full frontal.""  In reality, while she is certainly a beauty in real life, these scenes are oddly asexual; after all, in the film it's not really her, so to the viewer it seems that you aren't really looking at her body either.

If you watch this film, you might agree with Mr. Hawking; perhaps it's best to not make contact.  But then again, maybe some ""humanity"" -- if humans really have any at all, which I say is dicey at best -- might rub off on them if they come.  But in some good but also in some very bad ways.",1416441600,,2897,4.512476007677543

You took the time to write a non-review just to let us know that you have the attention span of a 5 year old?

Anywho, no promises that you will like the movie, but you don't really know what the movie is unless you watch the whole thing - there is a lot of character development for the main character, but there is very little dialogue so the development is done through the actions of the character, and her reactions/facial expressions throughout the movie.",1416355200,,910,4.347058823529411

Yes it does require the viewer to ""participate"" with your mind, your empathy, your imagination.
The movie is quite beautiful as it is dark and moody. Wednesday would have loved it. As they say her, Scarlett is a beautiful face. I could watch her drive like this all day. Definitively pouty lips. A real Bladerunner face. The scenery ain't bad either.
Of course aliens prefer crotch rockets. Close to feeling light speed as it gets...
Are we all aliens (even to each other) in our own little shells? Do we digest parts of our world without even thinking much about it? Of course we do. Where on the food chain are you?
Have you evolved at least past eating big intelligent creatures like whales?
Must you dominate large beasts for your riding and/or viewing pleasure? Is that not what happened to her at the end?

The movie is a very long string of strangeness, with almost no dialogue to let you know what's going on or why anyone is doing what they are doing. There is absolutely no explanation to any of the strangeness at any point in the movie.

If you like your movies clear and obvious (not mysterious and disturbing), if your tastes have been trained by Hollywood fare, you may well hate this (look at all the one-star reviews).  And at times, even I must admit, I found the movement of the film painfully slow.

That said, I LOVED this movie.  Once you give up on swift movement of plot, you'll find you can luxuriate in the stunningly beautiful photography.  And off-putting as it may be, the theme of the film gradually becomes clear: quite simply, all the SF-horror aside, this movie is about feeling, the beauty and the burden of feeling.  Feeling makes action deeply meaningful, but feeling also makes it hard to act.  By giving us the world from an alien pair of eyes, at first insensitive to human suffering, then gradually awakening to it, it allows us to look at the world in a fresh way and feel it anew.

This is one of the best movies I've seen in ages.  Not easily digested, not even always clear at times, but thought-and-feeling provoking in the best of ways.  If you can't see that, one-star reviewers, I'm sorry for you.",1416268800,2,1151,4.543689320388349

6314121,5,B00J22YU62,"To discuss much of what happens in this film would detract from the very reason this art film was made. You are meant to experience this film. You will find yourself confused, angry, sad, and disgusted and at times truly frightened. The main character's story arc and development are NOT your basic three-act-fare. This is a story of self-discovery that is meant to focus not only on the fragility of mankind but on the nature of beauty as we see it.

Scarlett Johansson was stunning in this film. Yes, she is nude. That is not the draw. She ""wears"" her skin in this film in such a manner that it feels ""alien"" from the very first time she is in frame. Her face is the focal point of much of the film, and most of the development of this character takes place on her face. You see her go from calm and focused tool of an undefined, yet frightening plot against mankind to a vulnerable and lonely being faced with the truism that beauty is truly ""skin deep"".

I love art films. If you do not, please don't waste your time on this film. You will not get answers or closure or a happy ending. However, if you want to see mankind through the eyes of a ""stranger in a strange land"" and experience a gambit of truly disturbing but visually stunning images, this film will take you on a journey seldom seen in today's cinema.

If you are a Scarlett Johansson fan, prepare to have your mind blown. Frankly, most of her highly commercial work to date hasn't shown her acting ability to the extant it is stretched in this film. Her journey is so personally naked through the film that the occasionally nudity isn't what is shocking. Her attempt to discover what it is to be human ends up tragically finding out how fleeting humanity truly is. When she is faced with how important her own beauty is and how delicate and easily destroyed it is, her moment of self-discovery is so poignant that it moved me as no other scene in film ever has.

If you plan to watch this film, prepare for an emotional roller coaster ride that will leave you spent by the shocking conclusion of this film. You will have more questions than answers, but you will see humanity in a completely different light. You will understand that what is ""Under the Skin"" is a lot more important than the beauty we put on a pedestal. Watch and enjoy.",1416268800,3,2305,4.416470588235294

Clarke's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with the morose music score and seemingly random scenes.  The only real clues that the film might be science fiction come when Johansson's character lures men to their seeming demise and at the very end of the film.  Otherwise, there is no explanation as to what actually happens to the men, nor what the motorcycle riding characters are supposed to be, nor what the plot is supposed to be.

If you're the kind of person who has described a piece of art as ""delicious"", you may like Under the Skin.  If you found Apocalypse Now to be too 'artsy', I can pretty much guarantee you'll hate Under The Skin.  As I read some of these reviews, I'm picturing reviewers sitting with their bare bottoms on velour furniture rubbing their niples, occassionally taking a break to suck down some oysters.  Anyway..

I've never liked Scarlett Johansson because she looks like she was genetically engineered to be a movie star.  I have no interest in her nude scenes because I think modesty was simply written out of her genome-- it'd be like looking at a mannequin!  But for the type of movie this is, she was perfectly cast.  This movie has a lot of schreechy music and naked female forms.  And erect dongers.
I can't say I've ever seen erect dongers in a movie.  But the nudity is 'tasteful' because the naked people were shot in a totally black or totally white background-- clinical, kubrick-esque.  There's no mud or oil!  So yeah, art.

To quote from my favorite movie of all time, The Big Lebowski as the Dude is talking to the porn king Jackie Treehorn:  ""Did you know Dude, that it's the brain that's our largest erogenous organ?""  The Dude's reply: ""On you maybe"".

I couldn't even make it to the half way point of the movie.  This film would be the result if a less manly Stanley Kubrick was given the script to Species.  I imagine later in the movie, there will be a bunch of 'odd' scenes where we're supposed to make poetic interpretations.  Really, really not my kind of film.

6314163,5,B00J22YU62,"There are a large number of people who will go to see Under the Skin simply because they heard that there was a great deal of nudity in it. Of particular importance, Scarlett Johansson, the famous and curvaceous blonde actress many men (and women) fantasize about, is particularly naked, the first time she has gone full frontal on film. This is of note, I guess, because, especially in the United State, nudity is taboo and actresses who are willing to be nude on film are often looked down upon (while actors who do it are considered brave). Johansson did not go nude for a blockbuster Hollywood film, but, rather, for art, which should get her a pass from our nation of prudes. I have a feeling that the pervs that go to see Under the Skin won't give it a pass, because they will likely be mystified  unless the pervs enjoy difficult, ponderous art films. Im not a perv, but I do love that type of film, and director Jonathan Glazer has made an indelible, hypnotic masterpiece of an art film with Under the Skin.

That the film offers no explanation as to the motivation or origin of Johannsons character and barely provides signals of her transformation. The audience needs to do a lot of work to piece things together, and this is often the hallmark of what we call art films. Sometimes, I think, this abstraction becomes pretentious, but other times, like in Under the Skin, the abstraction is what makes the art. I don't think too many people would argue that any semi-skilled actress could have done Johanssons part, but Johanssons fame was needed to bring in audiences. Once there, they can witness Glazers sublime use of the Scottish landscapes, Mica Levis truly haunting score and our own expectations of science fiction to create one of the most original major films in some time.",1416096000,3,1792,4.667721518987341

No doubt a challenging film to create, I enjoyed every minute, partly because it was not another simplistic, formulaic, low-brow, 100 million dollar ""blockbuster"" action flick. There was some real thought put into this, with some absolutely wonderful cinematography, and imagery that is still coming back to haunt me the next day.

Not everything is explained, but then the main character (Johansson) is a female alien, so we humans can't be expected to understand her motives. I enjoyed watching the female alien's growing comprehension of her assumed humanity. I hadn't expected that, and it was a nice twist.

If you want to see a really slow movie, watch ""Gerry,"" with Matt Damon. While ""Under the Skin"" is not that slow, it spends more time on too many scenes than it needs to. The scene where the female alien takes a bite of cake is the longest piece of film I've ever seen dedicated to such an act. But it's all about creating the mood, and the pacing helps create that mood effectively. That doesn't mean everyone who views this movie will care for the mood it builds.

Almost every human being identifies itself purely as the body w/out seeking out it's true soul and spirit.

Also the breathtaking symbolism throughout every scene would be spoiled with dialogue. And yes, each scene or encounter differs greatly as the character becomes to understand the attachments to flesh it had not before. So you see the two extremes. The dichotomy is the progression! I can't believe so many hated it!?  Just the gorgeous splendor of the dance and movement of every scene was worth it to me. But then again, I like pesky subtitles and Fellini movies too.

Whatever.
Criticizing each other or not, here's what I saw: I saw a director who is infatuated with Scarlett Johansson and somehow convinced her to appear bare-ssed naked, close ups and all, in some odd ball vain attempt to make a sci-fi art film that transcends common expectations and understanding of typical cinema. (IE, It helps her break out of that Avengers schlock that pays the bills.)
I liked her in The Island.
As for this movie, I was waiting for something to happen. The skin guy imploding was jolting and bizarre. All three male victims naked and erect didn't help me understand the point, unless, again, the shock value of something not usually seen in typical cinema. Didn't impress me and didn't add anything to the film. Odd, pervy muck. I don't need to see a guy naked much less 3 guys naked. Weirdo. The endless shots of trees and snow and nothing.

6314240,2,B00J22YU62,"My first reaction was, ""Why is this film soooo bad?"" No plot, no acting, no character development... nothing? Who would act in this film? Who would pay to have it made? Who would distribute it? Who would watch it? You get the idea...

Then I had an epiphany: This movie has nothing to do with heartless aliens feasting on bovine humans. Everything promoting ""a vision of humans from an alien point of view"" is the lure to catch the most likely (and most superficial) market there is for the real ""messages/meanings/communications of this film.

I am convinced that this film has at least two levels of subliminal ""messaging:"" First, it is a ""hit-piece"" against young men (perhaps men of all ages) as vapidly bound to their drive for physical/sexual comfort, and an equally damaging indictment of young women (perhaps women of all ages) who vapidly bound to ruthlessly exploit the male drive in ways, and to ends, that all but defy understanding.

Second, beneath this subliminal message is a second level of meaning/messaging that indicts the viewer for being drawn to a film built on the physical appearance and allure of a young female actress who does nothing more for just under two hours than show us her body while leading us to believe that she will either show us more or deliver on the promise of some other form of entertainment.

In service to both levels of messaging, all the actress does (literally) is back up while shedding her clothing... and we (men in general and movie viewers of both genders) are pulled forward (into the black emotional quagmire and aftermath of relationships that last only as long as they give HER whatever it is that she wants; and - at a deeper level - deeper into the bitter, irretrievable loss of two hours of our time hoping/waiting for something ""more"").

Neither of these two hopes are ever met and neither level of message is particularly complimentary to either gender. Yet they seem far more compelling as the ""artistic vision"" of the writer/director than anything having to do with extraterrestrials. The ""alien"" in this case is the writer/director who sees what pulls us toward the other gender, and the absolute, baffling carnage it creates. The accomplice is the ""star of physical beauty and high regard"" who was/is willing to be used as the vehicle for making the writer/director's point. I have no doubt that, in some way or on some level, she was well-paid, and I am equally confident that the rest of us were very ill-served.

This movie will probably earn a heads or tails response for any of a number of reasons.

For:

Great premise:  a hunter comes to earth and seduces guys who are then beamed off world to maybe be extraterrestrial sushi.

Great beam me up, Scotty, variant: bodies of victims are reduced into weirdly beautiful swirls and then pulsed, streamed, and narrowly focused to be sent off.

Great( Unforgettable) scene of chilling horror set on beach: she bags a valiant swimmer while a true human tragedy plays out in the background.

Great scene of almost human compassion: SJ finds a horribly deformed man and invites him to intimacy but then subjects him to the same fate as those she seduced earlier...or does she?

Great camera work: Two back lit shots trace SJ in stunning outline.  Later SJ appears nude in a masterful shot where she still preserves modesty. Never has an unmoving arm been so tastefully placed.

Not For:

Each scene in UTS  is in someway perplexing; so some people will get mad at being puzzled, while others won't. (An hour after seeing the movie the penny dropped and I figured out why a love scene had an odd ending. I liked this; others might find it geeky.)

If you do not have a high tolerance for silence and a razor thin plot, run.

Some might find the soundtrack too edgy.  If you liked Trent Reznor's soundtrack for The Girl With, you'll like this soundtrack: if not, then not.

It is set in Scotland which is different, unusual, and weird. That nation has many virtues but also the bleakest and harshest landscape imaginable; additionally, the people look like they know this.

Scottish people have an accent that Robin Williams perfectly caught in a description of the Scots inventing golf. If you remember it, you get this point.  If you don't know it...go immediately to YouTube/Funny or Die after this review. What you hear on UTS isn't funny, just unintelligible.

SJ captures the feeling of being in a strange land and being herself a stranger.

The ending is brutal, ugly, mysterious,horrible pass measure, and then oddly beautiful.  If this doesn't sound appealing then it is a final negative.",1414108800,3,2251,4.77979274611399

6314315,2,B00J22YU62,"This film reminded me of ""Melancholia"", which also had some spectacular visuals and a deliberate, very slow pacing, which helped set the eerie mood (and which, in both cases, I thought was one of the finer directorial decisions of these two films).  (The other thing these two movies have in common is showcasing famous actresses in shall we say clothes-free scenes.)  But ultimately ""Under the Skin"" was disappointing.

(Spoilers at this point)

When ""The Woman""'s true appearance was revealed at the end, I thought it undermined the self-discovery she had been undergoing - it seemed to me from the intro scenes that she was either made solely for her diabolical purpose and/or was perhaps a robot, and that her human skin allowed her to experience sensations that were new and in some ways overwhelming to her.  But in that revelatory scene at the end, it seemed she really was an alien life form underneath, and I thought it created a disconnect between her sensory explorations that she had been going through.  Also, if there is a small army of alien bikers ""minding"" the ""seducers"" like Johansson's character, it's a wonder there are any humans left at all - it seems they could be operating a regular man-eating factory with that much man power.

One side comment - I saw someone speculated that the woman at the beginning whose clothes Johansson takes was Johansson's predecessor, another alien stalker, which I thought was a very interesting possibility (note I have not read the book).  It makes that scene and the tear almost poignant, which is a nice touch, if that was the intent.

6314334,2,B00J22YU62,"I sat through the whole movie even though I really felt like stopping it after about 30 minutes in. The only real ""character"" is played by Scarlett Johansson. Others are only present to forward the flimsy plot. There is almost no dialogue or exposition. The plot consists of the main character seducing a series of men while trying to seemingly discover herself. There are no scary moments or graphic violence if you are sensitive to these matters. Johansson is frequently nude in a number of scenarios. Despite having an exceptional body, she alone isn't able to keep this movie afloat.

Contrasting the story, the cinematography is outstanding. The opening scene feels much like 2001. The frequent driving scenes are varied enough that they are interesting throughout. Some of the darker scenes demonstrate an excellent use of light without the cliched lens flares used by many contemporary action directors. The final act is interesting and it was the only time any emotion came from the screen.

Perhaps I missed the point of the film. It came off as more art-house than true feature. I think this would have been better presented as a 20 minute short film.",1411689600,,1161,4.918367346938775

Not even Scarlet Johansson's hot naked body could keep me from the fast forward button after 35 minutes.",1411603200,,295,4.959183673469388
6314338,4,B00J22YU62,"This is a film that couldn't help but polarise opinion. I found it riveting, but mostly that is due to Scarlet Johansson's brave performance; she delivers more than the filmmakers could possibly have hoped for.

Director Jonathan Glazer took the basic plot from Michael Faber's novel to craft this story about an alien who takes human form as an alluring woman (Scarlet Johansson). She preys on lonely males in Glasgow, who eagerly follow her impressive, denim-clad hips as she leads them into another dimension, seemingly to be consumed. The novel is explicit about what becomes of the humans, but Glazer is more ambiguous about their fate. The Alien, at first impersonal, begins to feel emotions about some of the men.

This is especially so in the moving encounter with a man (Adam Pearson) suffering from a disfiguring condition. She meets another man with whom she has an affair. She begins to questions herself and becomes disorientated, leading to a stunning ending.

In many scenes there literally isn't anything between Scarlett Johansson and the camera - there is a lot of nudity in the film. Her shape is a combination of the maternal and the sensual that has inspired artists from the cave painters onwards, but the sense of fertility she exudes is at odds with her character, which is anything but a giver of life. She projects a unique energy in this film, which I doubt too many other actors could generate in the same role.

The film was shot on the streets of Glasgow using a candid camera approach with real people, and no number of episodes of ""Taggart"" can prepare an outsider for some of the Glaswegian accents. However there really isn't that much dialogue; Scarlet Johansson's performance is almost wordless. Much of the story is communicated through the visuals and the silent interaction of the characters.

This film is far removed from other alien in human form movies such as ""Species"", or ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". It allows us to view humanity in another light - the good along with the bad. I feel it is more like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Not just because of those spheres against the light at the beginning (the formation of an eyeball), but more because Glazer challenges us to take a cinematic journey to another level of storytelling just as Kubrick and the Star Child did over four decades ago. I for one found it a journey worth taking.",1411430400,4,2381,4.797560975609756
6314339,1,B00J22YU62,"I understand that some people are calling this movie a work of art.  I do not have the same opinion.  The soundtrack is utterly horrible and it's reminiscent of a badly put together movie from the 70's.  90% of this movie is spent inside a van(which is stereotypical of ""rape van""s that creepy male kidnappers drive around in).  There are LONG scenes involving just weird lights and bizarre sounds, or watching a vehicle driving.  There is maybe 5-10 minutes of speech in this entire movie.  It never explains who she is or where she came from.  Do not even get me started on the creepy motorcycle guys who clean up her mishaps.  If you like weird, cheesey, bizarre movies with little to no dialogue or plot....  Then this is the movie for you.  Honestly, I think someone should refund my money for renting this.

6314346,3,B00J22YU62,"I don't blame Scarlett Johansson for doing this movie.  You're a top actor and the best you can do these days is action hero in spandex?  That's got to be a bit of cold water in the face - although her bank account is hardly as wounded as her pride might be.  And I admire her efforts in this film -- an alien literally trying to put on human skin.

After that, it might be nice to know what we are watching and why.  There must have been a plot in there somewhere.  It's not hard to guess that she is ""not alone"", but geez could they make it any more obtuse?  We have no idea why she does what she does, but clearly she doesn't deserve an ounce of compassion... (Line from Twighlight Zone:  ""It's a cook book!"")  Even after escaping an attempted rape and agonizing pain, it's not like E.T, or Jeff Bridges in Star Man, where the audience gets weepy.

The lights on/lights off effect (I'm an alien; Now I'm a flirting alien) don't really demonstrate Johansson's real skills as an actor - but she does do a pretty good Brit imitation, which makes no sense because she's in SCOTTLAND.  And they really don't develop the character.  Based on some gratuitous nudity, we get to see her demonstrate some banal level of curiosity with the body she borrowed.  She finds that she can't eat food.  Apparently, her manual didn't come with an explanation of human or female anatomy, but did show how to remove skin...

About the nudity:  It's a shame that almost every good woman actor has to drop her shorts to be taken seriously.  At least unlike Jennifer Lawrence, Johansson didn't stage her ""bearing of skin"" as some act of phone piracy and hard-to-believe ""personal crisis"" before the release of her next film (gosh? coincidence?)... Scarlett went full frontal doing what she does:  she acts.  I thought the nudity was largely unnecessary -- although there's a very funny scene with a desk lamp -- but I admire her guts even as I lament the conformism.

I really like Scarlett Johansson.  In interviews, she appears an intelligent, witty, down-to-earth person.  She can appear on a talk show without cue cards - Charlize Theron needs a voice double and still sounds less than intelligent.  When given a real roll Scarlett Johansson can really act.  And she is clearly attractive.

6314349,5,B00J22YU62,"As you can see by the huge number of 1 star reviews, this movie is not for everyone.  It's not the type of move to plunk down on a Saturday night and crack a few beers and wait for the jokes to come rolling out.  It's a move that demands a lot of the viewer, so I'd approach it as a short story and watch it on an afternoon when you feel like unwinding but doing something to excite your mind.

The complaints to this movie seem to be how slow it is, but I took (after watching it twice) that the slow shots were meant to show the barren, alien landscape that can be our world.  This goes for the claustrophobic scenes in the mall to the sheer emptiness of the Scottish woods.

I read the book before watching this film and was curious how much would carry over from the book to the movie.  As other reviews have said, it's very little, but I still enjoyed the film.  I like to think of adaptations as cover songs; someone doing a chord for chord copy is less interesting than someone giving the song's concept their own spin.

Ultimately, I came away with how rough and brutal we can be as a species, as seen through the eyes of an alien.  Granted, that alien came to earth to collect humans for meat, but the everyday humans treated her just as ghastly (if not more) than Scarlett treated her victims.  SPOILER: At the end of the movie, when Scarlett is confronted with a monstrous man who reveals her alien likeness, he comes at her in an attempt to ""destroy this monster,"" but in his actions he showed himself to be the true monster.

Finally, for those of you who just rent this movie for the revealing scenes of Scarlett Johansson, you should prep yourselves to see a whole lot of Scottish dong in the men she collects.

What little plot there is involves Johansson as a mysterious female with no name or clear identity, drifting about Scotland picking up lonely men hoping for a tryst but getting much more then they bargained for. Ms. Johansson is assisted, or perhaps supervised, its not entirely clear, by an equally mysterious male motorcyclist who has even less dialog. Who the characters are, or what they are up to is not made explicit, but their identity is hinted at throughout, and is somewhat revealed at the end of the movie. I thought the whole exercise was rather unsatisfying and in fact regardless of the fact that Johansson is a very attractive woman, you can only watch her pick up lonely dudes so long,  before wondering why the gentlemen don't start to think in spite of her looks, this is a really bizarre chick and maybe I will take a pass before following her to some abandoned house.

Under the Skin requires the viewer to use their intellect, certainly.  But more importantly, the languid cinematic style and minimal dialogue forces us (obviously uncomfortably for many reviewers) to visit our own heart and soul, and furthermore gives us time to do so.  This is inimical to consumer capitalism which demands that we see MORE EXPLOSIONS NOW! and requires a laugh track to instruct us in what is funny and order us to laugh--or sit, speak, roll over, or play dead.  And consumerism certainly never wants us to visit the dark night of our own souls or contemplate what it means to be human or our own mortality and the shortness of our lives, 'cause that gets in the way of time better spent watching car commercials, which promises that we'll live and spend forever.

All of the above being said, Under the Skin is probably the most haunting and beautiful movie I've ever seen--better than Never Cry Wolf or Jacob's Ladder, even--my two previous favorites.  I went into it expecting a horror film from the trailer and got a mesmerizing, very human tragedy.  Several days later the movie stays with me, and that seldom happens in most of the cacophony of blaring modern American ""Info-Edu-Tainment"".

I can absolutely see why some reviewers would revile it with that most American insult of all: That it seems ""European"" or an ""art film"".

Johnathan Glazer's films leave an impression. He doesn't work often, but he's serious about his craft. No throwaways with this director. He sets about doing something new and different. He's very much like Kubrick in that way. He also has a lot of Kubrick style, which will always please me, since I love Kubrick.
And like Kubrick you will not be able to easily forget this film.
For the majority of the run time you think you are watching the next great thing in horror. Unfortunately, the film keeps shifting, and shifts itself into a kind of ho-hum corner, when the rest of the trip was grand. It tests your patience just a hair too much, so in the end you are left a little frustrated, when if it took a little less time or went in a slightly different direction (I have no idea where), your mind would have been totally blown.

Movie begins with someone riding a bike, goes near water, picks up a body-assumed dead?- later we see lead actress taking the clothes of this dead person and scene changes. Somehow she drives a child molestor van around and picks up man. Now, you skin lovers down-down..because there is nothing to see here. She takes them a unknown location--viewer never sees the entrance or anything else regardign this place but it is a weird, extremely dark place. Naked guy walks towards her but at each step he is sinking into a black tar looking substance. yet, she WALKS on it like solid surface. Poor guy goes under, scene changes. You WILL NEVER find out why...Why she collected them, who she is....what was the purpose...no answers...And this cycle goes on few times. BORING and almost no conversation....Finally the end....who knows why but she is the forest. This weird guy attemps to rape her ( again you all down boy, because thre is nothing to see) when he takes her , sort of pulls off rougly, her clothes, he sees that her skin like a body suit is coming a part. Underneath, it is black substance that looks like how a human should look like without a skin( so to me alien theory is out). Guy gets scared and runs away....WAIT FOR IT!!! WAIT FOR IT......He comes back in a few minutes and pour gasoline on her( go figure please!) and lights her up. THE END. Movie  finished.

I don't mind slow-moving films (like 2001) if they make sense, even arthouse sense. This film could have made its point with far fewer scenes of the black styxian absorbtion of human beings.
The funny touch of Glaswegians being foreign to the alien woman made us laugh (we've been to Scotland many times & Glasgow really does have its own culture/language.
But just far too many scenes of Johansson's alien luring men into the black goo.
And the long scenes of a baby screaming in agony on the beach (not just crying, shrieking in fear) was horrific & unecessary. Showing a dog drowning (yes, we know that PETA would not have allowed a real drowning) was also uncalled for & did not serve the ""plot"" (there is no real plot, just endless scenes of the alien driving around, asking for directions & seducing men to their death (except the deformed man, who was rejected)
The cinematography was utterly gorgeous but sadly wasted on this film.
You could discuss all the symbolism forever (river styx, what is ""alien,"" why do humans react violently to things that are different, why did the alien come to earth, comparisons between this movie & others about aliens----Man Who Fell to Earth, Moon, 2001) but you'd still be better off skipping this film.",1409616000,4,1375,4.733333333333333

This is based on a great book, but only the outline of the book was used.  So, why do I love it?  Like the book, the film asks us not only to consider what it means to be human, but to acknowledge that being human and living among us would be attractive to an alien species.  Yes, SJ has little dialogue, but she is able to convey so much with her face.  I was captivated watching her examine her ""human"" self and discover the limitations of her mutation.  She is fascinating in this role.  Finally, great science fiction always gets is to examine ourselves by posing ironic plot devices.

Trust me when I say that's something because I'm usually pretty level headed and firmly believe that life is too short to dwell on the bad things in life. That being said I don't intend to dwell too much in writing about this movie because it was indeed one of the worst things in life to be found.

Story: a girl wakes up, takes the skin and clothes off another girl who looks just like her, leaves and begins trying to pick up men. With each one she lures them to a secluded location that always looks like a black room where they follow her as she disrobes doing the same and then walking slowly into the floor (which looks like black oil) only to go under and disappear allowing her to move on to her next victim. As the movie progresses she encounters different men and we later discover that she is in fact an alien observing humans. The end.

Seriously, this movie was so completely boring that even if viewed using the fast forward button it would be tedious at best. Some of the cinematography is worthwhile and the effects of walking into the dark pool are interesting the first time around but that's it. That's all the good things this movie has to offer.

I have little doubt in my mind that there will be pseudo-intellectuals who will hail this film as the next best thing since sliced bread (which I would guess they think is trite and common place) and all they will do by loving the film is display the emptiness with which they fill their minds. I noticed the praises heaped on this dung heap on the front of the box and yes, they do indeed come from sources that like to think of movies like this as art rather than admit that they had no clue what they were watching. To do so would be to lose credibility in those upper crusts societies they belong to. This truly is a movie to be avoided at all costs.

There is one type of person who will honestly love this movie without bringing their pretentious outlook to it. That's the peeping tom viewer that has been dying to get a good glimpse of Scarlett Johansson naked. That is if there wasn't a body double being used but it didn't seem so.

6314440,5,B00J22YU62,"Forget the haters, this is by far the best science fiction film since 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I really love Stanley Kubrick, so there it is.  Jonathan Glazer has done a very brave thing here: he has asked us to consider what it means to be human. Being human is complicated. Books and films too often want us to believe that being human is simple, linear, a journey with legible topography. Glazer, via Michel Faber's original source material, reminds us that being human is anything but simple, that being human is complicated and life is mostly meaningless. The older I get, the more I realize that life is mostly meaningless, and Under the Skin is a punch to the gut, a reminder of this simple truth.

I've enjoyed Scarlett Johansson's work since Ghost World, but wow. Where did this come from? Her portrayal of Laura/Isserley is a fully fleshed out creation, a reminder that being human is often terrible, inscrutable, horrifying, and mostly meaningless. Life can also be funny, if you happen to enjoy British comedies.

If you hate novels without plots, if you skate through life doing your nine to five routine without ever questioning it (also meaningless), you'd be wise to avoid Under the Skin, it will only piss you off. I loved it, but then I understand that plots are for dead people.

I reviewed parts of the movie again and understood it. It's probably one of best movies this year. It's really just an observation on human behavior/sexuality from the eyes of an alien perspective.

The movie drops you into a slice of life (about 3 days) of an alien (played by Scarlett Johansson) disguised a human being.  Since there is very little dialogue and facial emotion from the disguised alien, the movie seems surreal and repetitive.

There are some points in the film where there is a subtle change in the alien's thought patterns and these were the most interesting  scenes in the film to me.  However, because of the lack of a larger storyline most of the film plods along with scenes of an erotic or sexual nature (seduction, sex, rape).

In my opinion a little more plot and revealing of the alien's personality would have made the film a lot more interesting (such as who is it, where did it come from, why the alien is on earth, how did it come up with the disguise, what is the end game ? etc).  Also who are the motorcycle guys and what is their purpose (are they also aliens, are there a lot more aliens roaming the earth ? etc.) .

I think an opportunity was missed for a better movie and it may have been due to budget constraints which altered the original script significantly (as revealed in a Special Feature on the DVD).",1409097600,,1399,4.416342412451362

If you want to spend 90 minutes watching an arthouse experimental advert and don't mind the numbingly dull interactions between alien and human in Scotland, then you may well rave that this film is one of the best films of the first half of 2014, as many a professional film scribe have.  But if you're a normal filmgoer, who likes thoughtful, thought-provoking cinema along with your low-brow actioners, you'll find yourself feeling like the person in the crowd who realized that the Emperor - in this case our latest film Empress - has no clothes, literally and figuratively, and that this is not nearly enough draw to waste your time on.",1408579200,7,947,4.803680981595092

The men, blinded by the allure of the alien, follow her into darkness and are submerged in an abyss of liquid...their bodies vanish, leaving empty skins behind. But unlike other alien invasion films...this alien develops a conscience, leading to tragic consequences. Did I say the alien occupies the body of an erotic seductress? Well, who better to play that kind of role than Scarlett Johansson? Johansson is on display in this film - full frontal nudity and all - though the camera angles and lighting put her body in the shadows for most scenes. Though Johansson is still gorgeous, nudity does not become her as much as you'd think; as she looks a bit chunky in the hips and thighs. I'm guessing most of the money in this low budget film was spent on Johansson...and some very nifty camera work which produces cinematography of the first order.

I personally really enjoy deeply ambiguous, off-kilter films (another example would be Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master, which I passionately adore) that leave much of the interpretation up to the viewer, so I really loved Under the Skin. If you don't appreciate this kind of movie, fair enough, but it seems a bit peevish to come to Amazon and complain about a work of art that is simply not for you.

The individuals Scarlet interacts with were just random individuals she actually encountered while driving the streets of Glasgow for hours a night. They even filmed a scene in a nightclub and Mall without letting the general populace know that Scarlet was there.

There are some genuinely interesting interactions and conversations between the Alien Scarlet and the people she meets which give the viewer a fresh perspective on the human condition.

6314503,4,B00J22YU62,"I saw this in the movie theater and to be honest I think this is the type of movie that you can only really see in an intimate movie theater.  It's very haunting and unique, but there's not a lot of explanation at first and requires patience.  Personally, with the distractions that tend to come with being home I don't think I would've enjoyed this if I hadn't seen it in the theater.

This film is all about imagery.  There is almost no dialogue and the dialogue that exists is almost all improved.  Scarlett Johanison literally drove around town trying to pick up men and they were secretly recorded.  Afterwards the man would be told that he was being secretly recorded for a movie and that this woman he was with was actually a big movie star.  Once he got over his disbelief he would then be asked to sign a release form... some men agreed while others were to angry and refused to sign.  Those that signed ended up having their scenes in the movie.

So already by this method you can see that this movie is very different.  The message of the film is basically that you don't know someone until you've walked a mile in their shoes... or in this case, their skin.  This alien starts out having no sympathy for her victims, but being in the skin of one of her victims for so long leads her to start having sympathy.  It's a very haunting film and not one you will ever forget if you see it.  However it is not very fast paced and requires patience and just ""being"" with the film rather than wanting to see what's next.",1408147200,,1523,4.320422535211268

6314511,3,B00J22YU62,"Spoiler alert.  I'm pretty patient when it comes to watching movies.  Sometimes it takes a while to get into the characters or their surroundings.  I have to say this film by Jonathan Glazer tried my patience and then some.  There is no dialog for the first 15 minutes or so, just some weird visuals that may or may not have something to do with the blackness of space.  Then we see Scarlett Johansson (no character names used) stripping the clothes from a prostrate woman seemingly alive but paralyzed.  She puts on the clothes, leaves the naked woman behind and climbs behind the wheel of a white cargo van, left there by some strange dude on a motorcycle.

Things never get chatty and the entire film essentially has ScarJo coaxing young men, walking alone, into her van.  ScarJo's character is seemingly shy and almost childish.  It isn't hard for her to lure them back to her ramshackle apartment.  As she disrobes, the men, now in a trance-like state and fully erect, walk into a syrupy pool of blackness.  Her behavior changes mysteriously now and then which provokes a lot of questions.  But Glazer, working from Michel Faber's novel and Walter Campbell's screenplay, provides no answers.

My first experience with Glazer goes back to a series of music videos he did with Massive Attack back in 2001 but he's also responsible for ""Sexy Beast"" (good) and ""Birth"" (not good).  The film reminds me in many ways of those earliest of films by George Lucas (""THX 1138"") and Christopher Nolen (""Following"").  Low budget, confusing and questioning films all.

There are a few things that make ""Under the Skin"" watchable besides Ms. Johansson's full Monty which may be reason enough for many.  Overall her performance is noteworthy.  The film is beautifully shot.  The use of small Go-Pro-like cameras seemed to be used as well as other less small hand-held ones.  There are some great shots of the motorcyclist (protector?, companion?, teacher?) who's usually nearby or rushing to her rescue.  They never talk.  The music is interesting and seems to work well with the unusual film.  And yes after a couple days, I'm still thinking about it, but probably not enough to see it again.

The Blu ray version I saw looked very good.  Using a 1080p video resolution the film maintains a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  There isn't a lot of color in the movie aside from Scarlett's red lips and some shots of blue underwater, but the black levels are inky and the movie has a soft film-like image much of the time.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is also very good.  I'm reminded most of the soundtrack and a long scene at a cold Scottish beach where ScarJo grabs one of her victims.  This is a very unsettling scene in general and the audio enhances the dread.  What dialog there is comes with ScarJo's British accent and the locals, all of which have heavy brouges.  Hard enough to understand.  Thankfully the audio isn't a problem there either.  The Blu ray comes with Spanish and English SDH subtitles.  Extras include a Featurette broken into 10 sections (1080p; 42:23):

You can categorise the film as a science fiction, but it is not a science fiction in the normal sense.  It is a moody, eerie, meditative, shocking at times, beautifully directed, acted and photographed film with very effective music, sound and special effects.  Scarlett Johansson is the only star and she went through extreme hardship during the filming in terrible conditions but she managed to give one of her best performances in recent years.  The filmmakers aptly used Scotland wilderness as the film's background resulting in many breathtaking sequences.  Furthermore, as the film progresses, the alien became more aware of human instincts and became more human-like which resulting viewers' sympathy towards her.  Jonathan Glazer's earlier ""Sexy Beast"" with Ben Kingsley was shocking and powerful.  This film is a more mature work by JG who was strongly supported by his production team.

These scenes stretch on for minutes each, all without one emotional expression or word of dialogue.

It is kept from being an excellent film, in my opinion, by the handling of the establishing scenes at the beginning. Although I ""got it"", I believe it would have been a better film with more explicit exposition regarding the origin of the two characters responsible for most of the action, Ms. Johansson's unnamed seductress and Mr. McWilliam's unnamed motorcyclist. The implication is that they are aliens in disguise ""hunting"" for humans to be processed for food, but I think a little more clarity might have been good at the beginning and that lack of clarity may have been what put some of the reviewers off. This was a VERY brave choice for Ms. Johansson and she really does an outstanding job of developing her character with very little dialogue. The nudity (and yes, little boys, she is nude) is appropriate and helps move the story forward. The last forty minutes or so are some outstanding work and well worth the effort. It's hard to believe the gentleman playing the logger at the end is not a professional actor. All in all, more of a 4.5 than a 4.0 star film. It needed, in my opinion, more clarity at the beginning and a better plot device for ensnaring the men once they had been brought to the lair by Ms. Johansson. Also, some explanation about exactly why the aliens were handling their ""hunting"" in this manner would have been good, too.

Ok, so I watched the movie and would not have known what it was about unless I read the review on the front of Netflix envelope. Although, at the end it would be obvious what she was. I liked the movie in a certain sense and in the other I didn't because of not knowing what the heck was going on. I do agree with others the beach scene is very disturbing, well the part about the baby.

I decided to read the book for free on Amazon and got more irritated as it was different in most aspects from the movie. Now I get a lot of things but they are so different. I would love to have seen more that was in the book. That being said I will buy the movie and the book when the movie goes down in price as it is good in it's own weird way.

And since they didn't have the little deformed guy from the movie in the book, what the heck was that all about. I know in the movie she started to have some feelings. Does this mean she has some sad feelings about the little guy and couldn't harvest him as meat or what? Thank you to anyone that can help me with that thought.

I found the end very sad. I felt her sadness and then of course what happened to her. In the book she goes a different way. I would also loved to have seen one of her species like in the book so I could get a better picture of what she really looked like, yes she has human skin on but they cut her up from her normal self to look like a human. In the book they actually have one of the aliens come to the farm and he is in his true form. It would have been really cool to see her in a flashback of what she really looked like in the movie.

A very cerebral movie that you try to wrap your mind around all the subtle symbolisms and imagery throughout the movie.  I know some people will either love it or hate it but I just loved it.

This film will not be for everyone.  It's extremely slow paced and much is left unexplained.  If you're looking for a popcorn flick, this is not it.  It's the sort of film that should reward adventurous viewers willing to work at interpreting it.

6314567,3,B00J22YU62,"I'm going to give this movie 3 stars because if you consider the effort, it is, at it's heart, an art film.  I'm not really an art film type person but I watched the entire movie in an effort to determine what exactly was going on.  My curiosity and my abilities as a writer forced me to ""need to know"" what the movie was really about and to search for another level of meaning.

The movie, much like ""Enemy"" with Jake Gyllenhaal is bizarre.  Scarlett Johansson appears nude in the movie.... several times.  I guess she felt like this film was worthy of such an appearance.  Her character appears to be like a Black Widow... luring her potential mates for sex but ultimately killing them in a very unusual method.  They seem to walk into a pool of liquid and remain there until they are digested.  In one scene we see one victim looking at another victim and seeing what has become of his insides.... We see the internal collapse and what is left is the skin.  This is apparently how the ""aliens"" are able to move around amongst us.  Wearing our skins.

It seems clear to me that she didn't enjoy what she was doing.... At one point in the film she appeared to want a different life.  She stopped hunting men and ran off with a man to his home.  She even attempted to have sex with the man.  This was of particular interest.  You see, prior to the sex scene she has a moment where she appears fully nude in a mirror and examines her form.  Those (like myself) who find her very beautiful will enjoy this scene despite its somewhat clinical nature.  After this scene Scarlett's character attempts to have sex but is unable.  She is not anatomically correct.  She examines herself with her back to the camera to convey this to the audience.  I found this rather curious.  She seemed to not realize that because she's wearing a human skin that does not mean she's capable of living as a human and participating in coitus.  Yep.... I said coitus.... Big Bang Theory... LOL.

Anyway... the other aliens appear to be searching for her as if they need her to continue in her role.  That really isn't resolved.  Further... after the failed coitus she runs off and a man attempts to rape her.  When he discovers that she's not human he burns her.

Ultimately I found little meaning in the film.  It doesn't say much about society, nor the interaction between humans and aliens.  There appears to be a mild element of delusion when Scarlett's character abandon's her role and tries to live as a human..... Why?  Does she realize that she's murdering people?  Does she feel remorse?  We don't see her cry.  There is no emotion save for when she is attacked.  There is no resolution of her fellow aliens attempting to find her.  It seems they don't have any way of communicating with one and other.

I give the movie a three because it does have some interesting imagery.  Scarlett Johansson is very beautiful and if you want to view her in her natural form.... not covered in make up and photoshopped then you will appreciate her personal bravery.  During a time when big A list movie stars like her don't normally take their clothes off for just anything, she chose a daring film that challenges you to search for meaning and create you own answers.  She's not worried about looking perfect, although she is quite beautiful, and she says, in essence, ""Here I am"".... ""Take a picture.""  50 years from now she'll be able to look back and say.... DAMN.... I was hot!.",1407369600,,3454,4.508064516129032

6314580,1,B00J22YU62,"Hmm, a movie about a woman (representing the church) gaining spiritual insight (eye, fountain at beginning of movie - look up word ayin in Hebrew) and being reborn (given a new body, symbolically) leading lost individuals to the oil (Holy Spirit) so that they can cut away the flesh by being baptized by the oil (Spirit) and be saved. Even hitting them in the head with the rock (Jesus) to forcibly bring them to the oil (Holy Spirit) in once instance. She later has doubts about her new birth as she is tempted by sin (the slice of cake) and the man who takes her in. The difficult to understand dialog also suggests that Christians are in their own world, unable or unwilling to reason with earthy people. After her fall from grace she finds herself alone and afraid in the wilderness as her God has deserted her and left her at the mercy of wicked man. Of course this sick twist on the biblical plan of redemption has the wicked rapist lumberjack (who Im assuming is cutting away at the Tree of Life) cast as the hero (savior) who burns both body and spirit of the chosen woman (church) with fire to save fallen humanity from her influence. Sorry, but there is only one Yahweh who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell (Matt 10:28) and this art house movie has not convinced me otherwise. It is Yahweh we should fear and not wicked men who seek to destroy His people, as those who envisioned this film. Yahweh will not desert us if we return to Him. This clever use of biblical symbols (including four horsemen as motorcycle riders, and Im sure many others) in an attempt to deceive the masses who do not yet have their spiritual eyes open to understand this is just plain evil and it is no wonder the critics are raving about it, as many movies tell stories that mock our God and Savior in a similar light and many people just do not notice it, because they just do not know their bibles as they ought to. Those who made this movie and know what it is about are probably laughing so hard at the lack of spiritual insight of most of the moviegoers who see the film. They probably will not be laughing so hard once those moviegoers seek their God, read their bibles, wake up and understand what they are saying with this movie and how they have been duped.",1407196800,,2266,4.372037914691943

Then a little while later, we wondered if we both have gone deaf cause we couldn't understand a word of what was being spoken. So we looked up the subtitles and got them for the film from subscene. Fifty minutes later, I was very lost about what was going on so we thought if it was us being really stoned or whether the film is a bit ajeeb. The film ended and we were both surprised. I decided to go to imdb and read the entire plot synopsis. Once I read the synopsis, I really liked the film. But then I wondered why should I have to read the plot synopsis, I got really confused. I think one reason this film is getting confusion is because we men had something to look forward to in our lives, now that we have all seen Scarlett naked and realized she has no angels or wings, we are all really confused but maybe something new will come up.

6314590,4,B00J22YU62,"When I first saw ""Eraserhead"" it blew me away. The weirdest film I'd ever seen. Then, more recently, was ""Enemy"" with Jake Gyllenhaal. Definite weird to the 9s. Now I've subjected myself to this oddity and I feel I'm on a roll.

Here's the scoop. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien who lures men, mostly loner types, in with the suggestion of sex then proceeds to kill them and process them for food for her fellow aliens. She has a male counterpart on a motorcycle who moves in and out of the picture periodically. She runs into all types of folks, both good and bad, and begins to (seems to) start wondering about those she is killing, as though she is gaining some degree of empathy.

This is a real polarizing film. As one can see by the spread of reviews, there is not a lot of middle ground. Most either love it or hate it. I can't say it's the best movie I've ever seen but it carries a lot of weight and has some tremendously powerful scenes. One, set on a turbulent beach, where a man is trying to save a drowning woman, is like nothing I've ever seen. But this is also a very dreamy film. At first I thought it was moving too slowly but each scene was so powerful the feelings of slowness fell by the wayside. The music score is really odd but it worked for me. It helped underline the alien quality to everything. There are some very eerie images throughout. There is one scene where a man, stricken by neurofibromatosis, is running naked through some reeds that is very unsettling. Some scenes involved special effects but the effects weren't 'look at me', 'look at me' effects. They enhanced the narrative.

This is not for the impatient. I can see why many would shut this off halfway through. But for me it was a real treasure. A definite repeater. I figure this will yield more with successive viewings. I saw director Johnathon Glazer's earlier ""Sexy Beast."" I found it very very powerful and disturbing. This is equally so but in a different vein.

6314592,4,B00J22YU62,"Scarlett carried U.T.S. from start to finish proving once again it's been a good year for her career.  The unclad Scarlett wore her nakedness like a costume, figuratively and literally, as you'll see, and her scenes of self-discovery like a pre-teen in front of a mirror were astonishing in that the full impact of her introspection really occurred to you near the end of the movie when you realized what she was really looking at.  Her confidence with her body surpassed the nearly awkward earthiness of her torso and primal gait.  How magnificent she was in carrying her mysterious presence and the conflicts imposed upon herself.

The faults with this movie recall the comments made years ago by Carl Sagan, the astro-physicist, who scorned the believers of intergalactic space travel who believed that aliens would require landing zones on Earth similar to air fields now in existence.  It seems the aliens in Scarlett's movie could have figured out a more efficient way of incapacitating humans.

I have not read the book this movie may have been based on, and have recently noticed how many reviewers have based their comments on the disparity between this movie and the book.  That's unfortunate, because cinema is a totally different medium. The criticism about the pace of this movie reminds me of the comments made years ago about the slow tempo and sparse dialog of Antonioni's films.  Apparently, such changes, drastic or subtle, are too much of a challenge for the popular movie-goer who expects to be passively entertained.  This movie demands otherwise, you must reach out to it.

The only similarity between the book and film is that an alien woman picks up men for purposes other than sexual.  Faber's book explores the psyche of the creature who has endured massive body reconstruction to allow her to pass as human.  This has not been too successful but because the model ""woman"" design was sourced from a ""lad mag"" she has amazingly alluring breasts.  The book not only explores the woman's internal dialogue but also delves into the thoughts of the male victims as well as an alien visitor who is concerned about animal rights.  The woman's prey are seen by her as animals and her species as human.

It has a great story, an interesting story - interesting in how it turns around the convention of the ""good"" gal (or dude) who turns bad, and seeks revenge, because of hard circumstances. And it's a marvel to watch, achieving what all great films do: it persuades you to watch closely and then rewards this attention. It teaches us something about watching not just science fiction but moving pictures.

The baby-on-the-beach scene, for example. Any viewer who sees this and is not shaken up, unsettled, is not really watching the movie. That's a truly horrifying image.

Or the mirror scene, when our heroine studies herself - so quiet, so long a shot, so purely terrifying, BECAUSE we want someone to come up behind her. BECAUSE we think we know what we're seeing, and this movie, like all great movies, is partly about questioning what it is you think you see in a movie when you watch a movie. Or what it is you think you'll see when you see Johansson in the screen.

The opening sequence is the most fascinating and chilling scene I've seen since the opening of von Trier's _Antichrist_. This film has little in common with that one, but there is a similar undercurrent, a cool quiet to the film, a nervous expectation of ours that is not quite fulfilled that reminds me of von Trier's film.

The other is Scarlett Johansson as she is both gorgeous (and fully nude in several scenes) and does an excellent job portraying Isserly.  Other than that, I wouldn't have given this any stars.  The movie is only VERY tenuously tied to the book.  The book is an excellent read after a somewhat slow start that gives you an alternative way of looking at things and takes its time letting you know what's really going on...and then provides some very interesting character changes/growth...or not depending on how you look at it.  The movie takes place in cities, has Isserly going to shopping malls, and taking on marks outside of her vehicle - basically pitting her physically against much larger males - something that never would happen in the novel.

6314647,5,B00J22YU62,"People will rent this movie for two reasons- Jonathan Glazer or Scarlett Johansson.  If you are renting becase you like Glazer's movies (and really-can you imagine a stronger debut than Sexy Beast?) then you are in for a treat.
If you are renting because of Johansson, particularly because if you have read that she gets naked in the film, than caveat emptor, buyer beware, etc. etc.  Run away, little boy, back to the internet and porn search.
In fact (minor reveal, so beware), there is a scene in the movie which is a perfect metaphor for that type of viewer/reviewer.  Men in the film follow Johansson into a pure black field because she is undressing.  You might think they would stop and look around and wonder about where she is leading them but, heh, this is ScarJo and she is taking her clothes off so they will follow into pure shiny black space shedding their clothes.  And then they start to sink into that pure black field.  Still gazing at Johansson.  They sink until they are well over their heads and then they watch her walk away above them. And then they look around and notice other suspended guys and realize they should have paid more attention.
Well most of the negative reviewers are like those guys. Slowly sinking into this very unusual film they rented because of ScarJo and suddenly realizing that they are watching this really disturbing and highly stylized film.
So much for them.  This movie is very much worth seeing.  ScarJo is playing with her stardom these days bending it to work in all sorts of very good films.  Glazer is on top of his game.  This film is as claustrophobic, as disturbing as Polanski's Repulsion.
In any case, ignore the negative reviews if you want to see something truly odd and visionary.  This is a very good film, subtle, disturbing with a brilliant visual style and an actress who is in full control of her art and career.",1406592000,45,1882,4.618618618618618

6314663,4,B00J22YU62,"Let me start off by stating, this is not for everyone. I find it weird that some people are giving this a one star rating but at the same time, I don't blame them. Some people just can't accept the way art is meant to be seen. This is truly an art-house film! Not much dialogue, the story is pretty straightforward. It doesn't take a genius to understand what is going on. However, the first time I watched it, I didn't understand some of the imagery that was presented until I watched it a second time and it all made sense. I'd rather not tell you much about the film, it's one of those movies you just have to watch and experience for yourself. If you are not intrigued by the first 10 minutes, then it's obviously not for you. This is one of those movies where you have to let the movie speak for itself and YOU interpret what it means to you. It's very abstract! Sadly, it's an art form, a lot of people don't appreciate anymore. This film isn't going to tell you what is going on, it's going to show you, so be ready!

I found this film to be inspiring! I know that sounds funny but how often do you come upon movies like this. Watching it, should put us to shame because anyone could've made this movie. People keep comparing this to Kubrick but I don't find the connection (Maybe the look of the film). I think this movie stand on its own because I haven't come upon a movie like this. It's originality, it's complexity, and depth are the reasons I enjoyed it! If you enjoy movies where people aren't shouting the obvious then this movie is for you. It's silent, eerie, disturbing, unique, thought provoking, abstract, beautiful, haunting, poignant, artsy. Scarlett does a great job at playing the nameless alien, it's unlike anything she's done before. She starts off as this emotionless alien who completely lacks human qualities like vanity, fear, love, etc. and as the story progresses, one male victim at a time, she begins to see herself as a human and understand the emotions of a human-- a human with complexity, vulnerability, fear, emotion, awareness, giving the alien depth. Without giving away too much of what happens to every male victim she lures, just know it's disturbing, if you understand what is going on. There was a scene that I found chilling, where an infant child witnesses his family drown in a beach, what happens next gave me chills. See for yourself! It's important to the story and to understanding ""it"" (Scarlett Johansson).

Give this movie a try! It's not for everyone, but if you watch it with an open-mind and low expectations then you might enjoy it! I know I did. I've seen it twice and I have a better understanding. It took me a while to process whether or not I liked the film but I found it to be perfection.

6314668,4,B00J22YU62,"Some have compared this movie to Kubrick's work... well, maybe, if he was on acid! Actually, this film appears more akin to the films of the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky (Stalker, Nostalghia, Solaris), and having said that this is definitely not for folks who want the traditional science fiction plot and pacing, which may account for the very negative reviews some people are giving it.

True, the movie provides few of the conventional devices used to guide the viewer from point A to point B, so you're on your own, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out pretty quickly what's going on. As such, this is an eerie, visually stunning film, but a radical departure from the norm and uses silence interwoven with menacing music and sparse dialogue to make its points about aliens who are here for nefarious purposes.
The fate of dog and the family was sad, though that had nothing to do with aliens except to demonstrate their single-minded purpose including a complete lack of regard for human life, and the moral of that story is don't let your dog play in waves big enough to eat a ship! And if your dog does play in waves big enough to eat a ship, heartbreaking as it may be, it's probably best not to swim after it.

The following day I watched it in three segments, getting up and doing something else twice during the movie to wake up. Almost nothing exciting happenings in this movie, and you never really get an explanation of what is going on, except that in the final ten minutes of the movie you finally see what the woman really is.
Her victims have no emotions even while being ""consumed"". They sink into darkness as though they do not even notice what is happening to them. Why she is doing this to them is never explained in the movie, and I got the word ""consumed"" from the synopses. Why she runs away would also be unclear if not for the synopses.
In short, only by reading explanations elsewhere does this movie make any sense, and some parts still do not make sense with only the synopses for outside information.
Also, due to the night scenes, back lightly, and other low lighting it is often hard to tell what is happening. I will note here that there are some nude scenes in this movie, but they are all either in low light or backlit.

My girlfriend says I am a film snob but I have several degrees in film production, history and criticism so I do look at every film (well, not every one- i.e. Transformers) in many layers and this is certainly one of those. The acting, cinematography and music are woven together in a beautiful and haunting way that gave me both chills and sadness. So many novels are dumbed down for the film (Starship Troopers, totally lacking the real meaning of Robert Heinlein) but this one was not.

I do like my fair share of low budget movies and since this one managed to snag Scarlet with promises of nudity I figured why not? For 15 dollars I figured eh I've bought worse things for that. The truth is this is probably one of the dumber movies Ive seen and Ive seen a lot of really bad movies. This one is probably in my top 10 worst movies Ive seen....a list that includes Serbian film and Bad Taste and Human Centipede 2. Anything lumped into that list of movies should never be seen.

*NOTE TO AMAZON* Put some of the 1 star reviews on the front page of this turd of a movie.

*SPOILERS* but then again there isn't much of a plot to start with.

Reading some of the reviews I see people talking about how Scarlet is an alien.....ok great. Too bad the movie never says this. She could be a demon, a ghost, a mutated bigfoot, or yes even an alien. There really is no clue given as to what she is.
This movie starts with a bright light getting closer and closer and brighter to you and then a guy dragging a girl from the ditch and bringing her back somewhere. At this point Scarlet takes off this dead girls clothes and goes about her business. This business is apparently luring lonely men back to her place.....a place that none of the guys question is dark and has no lights. I guess she puts them under a trance I have no idea the movie doesn't explain how all these men become that stupid. I know promises of sex with Scarlet will make any man weak in the knees but still these men become exceptionally stupid. The brain doesn't automatically turn off when sex is involved.

She strips and walks and they strip and walk towards her. Eventually they start walking into a black liquid pool while she walks on top of this surface since I guess she can walk on water. For the first hour or so this is all this movie is, yes there is a creepy scene when you see inside of the black pool and one guy shrivel up and die but that's about as thought provoking and as much detail as we get out of this black pool. The conversations for luring this men are basically ""Hi, Im lost please help me get to X"" which are followed up with ""are you alone? Do you have family? Do you want a ride?"" literally it's the same conversation 4 times over.

Scarlet also spends entirely too much time either just walking around or staring off into space. There are long periods of silence as Scarlet stars off into space or just walks around aimlessly. There is also her just driving around too. Again some reviews mention in the book she is thinking deeply and people would like to project that onto what happens in the movie but the truth is in the movie she just stars into space and puts on lipstick now and then. There is nothing thought provoking here unless putting on lipstick is the path to enlightenment then there really is nothing to think about here.

There is a baby left on the beach by himself scene which is allegedly creepy.....it could be creepy but like most of this movie it becomes pointless filler. The baby is just sort of there. The beach scene would be fine with or without the baby.
Close to the one hour mark of this snooze fest Scarlet inadvertently picks up a very ugly man with a disfigured face. She suckers him into riding back with her to her place. He too even if he is more suspicious than all the other guys to this point, falls under her magic trance and walks into the black pool. Here is where the movie diverts from its plot up to this point and Scarlet drags him out of the black pool for some unexplained reason. The best guess we have here is sympathy but since she is some weird creature that can walk on black water it's hard to say what her motives would be. Again some reviewers would have us assume things like sympathy but the truth is since we have 0 clue what Scarlet is and what her motives are beyond tricking men back to her place for an unknown reason, we cannot project a reason onto her motivation for letting Mr. Ugly Man go. Part of her thought process to deciding to let Mr. Ugly Man go apparently include staring a fly on a glass door window and staring at herself in the mirror. I suppose this is deep thinking at work but this movie offers 0 clues on any deep thinking.

Now at around this time some mystery man decides to capture the fleeing ugly man and put him in the trunk of his car while an old lady watches this from her window. No cops are called or anything. This man is then seen at various times riding around on a motorcycle in what I can assume he is doing is chasing Scarlet down but that's an assumption at best. The movies only clue is he captures Ugly Man, but what he has to do with Scarlet is left for us to wonder. Some reviewers say he is an alien like Scarlet but in the movie we are never clued into whether she is an alien or how he even knows her or whether he is even an alien. You are given 0 clues to go on as to what this man is. Again he could be bigfoot in a human costume for all we know.

At this point Scarlet is shown to have abandoned her car for whatever reason, going into a restaurant of sorts and ordering a cake to eat. She tries to eat it but spits it back up. Scarlet is then shown walking down a road to which a guy tells her a bus will be here any minute, so she goes to the bus stop and waits. Presumably the same guy that was there and told her about the bus stop(I say presumably because this part of the movie is shot from a really high distance that you cannot see the actors....there are far too many camera shots that are just way off and from a distance or other weird angles in general) gets on the bus with her and starts hitting on her. The bus driver starts talking to her too. She says nothing to these people which is strange because she had 0 problem talking to men up to this point. Finally the man who got on the bus with her asks her ""do you need help?"" and she says ""yes"". That is the last piece of dialogue Scarlet says in the entire movie at right around the hour mark. You have another 45 minutes to go with the main character now being a mute....though to be fair she didn't talk much in the movie anyway.....shes the perfect the woman....SHE DOESNT SPEAK AMIRITE GUYZ????

She goes home with him and eventually they have sex to which she seems disgusted and checks out her vagina immediately afterwards but why we are not told or shown despite a few minutes before that we see Scarlet examining her whole body in the mirror. Yes this is your payoff you get to see  nude Scarlet in the mirror for a good minute. Checking herself out. Congrats there is your reward.

After Sex she runs into the forest apparently and some guy tries to pick her up but doesn't. She then goes to rest in the cabin in the forest where he tries to rape her and yet she still doesn't scream, she does fight back and get away. He then tries to rape her in the forest chasing her down where we get the big pay off for this movie.....we see her skin is falling off and she is a black humanoid creature underneath.  She is strangely silent during her attempts at getting raped and her skin falling off. She remains silent when the man comes back with gasoline, throws it on her, and sets her on fire. Yes she runs through the woods on fire dying and doesn't let out a scream. Maybe she is some sort of alien without a sense of touch? Who knows. And that's basically the movie.

Some random black creature girl with human skin takes men back to her secret lair and has them fall into the black pool. What is she? What is the black pool? Why does she have sympathy on one towards the end? Why can she not talk in the Last 45 minutes of the movie? Why is half of the movie her staring into space? Why are the camera shots so bad? What was the mysterious light at the beginning of the movie?  Why did she put on that girls clothes? Who is the guy on the motorcycle? Also why are the camera angles so weird in this?

Seriously bad movie....1 star review. Terrible plot. Terrible camera angles. Bad use of Scarlet. DO NOT BUY.

Its sad there could be something amazing here but there isn't.",1406246400,7,8133,4.1938579654510555
6314696,1,B00J22YU62,Don't buy! There is nothing redeeming about this movie.,1406246400,,55,5.222222222222222
6314697,1,B00J22YU62,"Here's why.

**The Plot...wait, what plot?**  If you watch this without reading the book or looking it up online first, you'll have no idea what is going on or why.  That's because there is no voiceover, no Star Wars-style rolling text intro, and very little actual dialogue period throughout this entire disaster of a movie.  The intro is nonsensical and develops incredibly slowly.  I thought after all that time, there'd be a nice payoff.  Nope.  As far as I can tell, the intro has nothing at all to do with anything that happens afterward.  Absolutely nothing is explained in any way, shape, or form.  You'll find yourself watching scene after scene wondering why she talked to one guy and not the other, why she stares into a mirror or off into space for long periods of time, what the motorcycle riders have to do with anything, and why she's doing the things she's doing.  In the end, you end up with nothing but questions and no answers.

**The Dialogue**  I'm a native English speaker, and the only person I could understand was Scarlett Johansson.  The Scottish men with speaking roles were apparently chosen because they have the thickest Scottish accents in the history of mankind and either speak abnormally quickly or in hushed, inaudible tones.  There may be only 10 characters with speaking roles in the entire movie:  Scarlett, and Scottish dudes 1-10.  In almost all cases, the interactions are brief, provide no clarification on her motives, and focus around nonsense like ""How do I get to the M81?""  ""Where are you headed?""  ""Is that on the way?""  and ""Do you have a girlfriend?""  And for about the last 1/3 of the movie, Scarlett doesn't speak at all for some unknown reason.

**Nothing makes Sense**  Why is she riding around in a van picking up random guys?  Why is her ""home"" this black void behind a normal looking door in a normal looking building?  Why doesn't she fall down into the ""stuff"" that the men so eagerly walk right into like they're in a trance?  Why don't the men move once they're in that ""stuff""?  What role do the motorcycle riders play?  What's with the woman's body at the beginning, and is she still alive?  If not, why does she shed tears?  If so, why doesn't she move?  How did she end up in the ditch?  Who is that woman and what's her purpose?  Yeah.  No answers in the movie.  It's just long periods of quiet mixed with random images thrown together intended to be artistic and meaningful, but ends up failing miserably at both.

I despised this movie.  If taken in another direction, it could've been solid.  Such a shame.",1406246400,,2575,4.629711751662971
6314698,1,B00J22YU62,"Really really bad. Most 'art' movies are rotten, but this one seems to be deliberately stupid. I sort of wish I had read the novel, as I suspect it would have been more entertaining on paper. As a film it tells one nothing about being human on any level.

I hope the director, Jonathan Glazer never works again. Never ever ever ever. I certainly will never spend a dime on a movie he is connected with. At times the director even manages to make the scenes of a naked and nearly naked Scarlett Johansson entirely unexciting. A considerable achievement, I suppose. Early in the film we are treated to American Johansson speaking in impeccable BBC English to entirely unintelligible Scotsmen, and I thought perhaps there was going to be a humorous undercurrent to the story. No such luck.

Johansson's career will (already has, actually) survived this clunker, but she really needs to reconsider who she is getting advice from about where to spend her considerable talent.",1406246400,,970,4.837349397590361

The film has a very alien feel too it also. The often abstract and otherworldly aspect of the film seems however to suit the themes of the film. As a viewer we share in the strangeness of the world that the aliens themselves might be experiencing being in our world. Alienation seems to be the major theme of the film and this comes to the forefront when one of the aliens played by Scarlett Johansson becomes lost physically and psychologically. The film is slowly paced but this also seems to facilitate our immersion within this alien world. Like watching a David Lynch film we find ourselves alienated from the world, perhaps getting a glimpse of what the world might be like if we were seeing it for the very first time.

Something so alien (Johansson's character), that begins to slowly, with increasing confusion, experience a gleam of Humanity, but then to be consumed by an unexpected and somewhat ironic reversal.  This film made me realize, again, what it's like to watch and have so many questions to think about afterwards, to be challenged and make the connections amongst the quiet bits of film work, between the allegories, to decipher Ms. Johansson's facial expressions rather than her words.  We tend to get spoon-fed cinema, lately, and we lose track of the films that require us to assemble the pieces together for a wonderful experience.  This is a wildly odd and intricate film, yet it's premise is as simple as an old pulp science fiction short story, or perhaps an Outer Limits teleplay.  The diverse filming techniques (the breathtaking long shots of foggy landscape, or the tight, hidden multi-camera scenes), the surreal and alien concepts (the black mirror pool), the incredible and beautifully creepy soundtrack (at points even sounding reminiscent of old horror movie ""pensive"" music), the total immersion of the actress (that she walked streets unrecognized, in her new ""skin""), all combined for an incredible film, one of the best of this year.",1406246400,3,1489,5.111111111111111

6314716,1,B00J22YU62,"IT WILL GET UNDER YOUR SKIN!!

This film is surprising, but not in a positive way. It's surprising why an A list actress like Scarlett Johansson would appear in this very low budget film. A film that looks as though it was shot by a first year film school student.  How low budget does this film look? Ok, the sci-fi props include the white van that Scarlett drives around in looking for unsuspecting guys to pick up, oh and two motorcycles that two dudes ride around on, in some last minute so-called action scene. THAT'S IT!!

The director of this film Jonathan Glazer uses scenarios from other sci-fi films, such as the opening scene where Scarlet's nude character (no character's names are used in this film)  takes clothes from a human to use, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""The Terminator"". Then her character picks up males using her sexual charm to use for her own alien purposes, think ""Species."" Big mistake Scarlett made, appearing in this no budget boring film, that had practically no or very little theater release and appeared on DVD very quickly.  There is scene in this film of Scarlett in panties and garters. She actually looks fat!! With a gut!! Also the scenes of her picking up men, the dialogue is so idiotic and amateur it's embarrassing. There are scenes of Scarlett on a beach, shot at extreme wide angle that looks like an amateur home movie.

This film did nothing for Scarlett's film career what so ever. Where was her agent to advise her against doing this film? As a screenwriter I have scripts that would be far more rewarding for her than ""Under the Skin.""

If you want to see a great low budget sci fi film, pick up the DVD ""The Machine"" a film about a sexy beautiful female android discovering about herself, it's far more enjoyable.",1406160000,,1768,4.6293929712460065

6314768,5,B00J22YU62,"I love the sight and sound of this movie. A director rarely shoots and assembles a film this well. Jonathan Glazer knows how to create memorable images. And, he does so in scene-after-scene-after-scene in this film. I am impressed with how each scene is a piece of first-rate cinematic art. Glazer combines visual elements masterfully. Just watch the opening sequence. Just watch a late scene in which Scarlett Johansson's character wanders in a fog both psychologically and literally. Just watch an earlier scene with a family by the crashing sea. Just watch the seduction scenes that are actually done in a beautifully minimalist way. Just note the symbolism of this female predator wearing fur or placing a ""threatening"" ant on her finger.

Furthermore, Glazer has the brilliance to combine the right sounds with these visuals. He uses shrieking violins when he wants to disturb us. He uses silence when the audience would like more information. He uses characters' labored breathing when he wants us to feel their fear. Much dialogue is indistinct in the movie, but this muttering is appropriate, for it presents the protagonist's confusion while analyzing the humanity around her. I love the masterful amalgamation of visual and sound in Under the Skin.

I like also two things that others might not like about the movie. The pacing is very slow at times. Or, would a person say that the pacing is quite deliberate? I think that the slower pacing mostly works. The audience takes in each scene fully. This experience matters especially in uncomfortable scenes. Director Glazer dares to tell us that we are not cutting away; we are not going anywhere safer. The slower pace works also for great build-up. Throughout Under the Skin, the audience does not know fully what is going on. We do not know exactly what Johansson's protagonist is thinking (although, the actress conveys her inner world excellently, often without saying a word). The measured pace builds and builds the suspense. When is the alien going to find her next victim? Once she has him chosen, when is she going to strike? What is going to happen next in this bizarre and imaginative film?

Under the Skin is exceptionally creative. Competent surrealism is rare in the cinematic arts. Under the Skin represents a well-done example. I shall not try to explain much further. Simply, Under the Skin is a trip. Simply, Under the Skin has moments worthy of a Kubrick or a Gilliam. Watch it altered, or watch it sober. It'll sometimes blow your mind, man.

I mentioned that Under the Skin has two elements that might not work for everyone. Pacing is one. I have already indicated the other: ambiguity. Perhaps, do not watch Under the Skin with friends who want everything spelled-out for them and everything resolved. Under the Skin is ""thinking man's sci-fi"" for people who analyze and interpret during viewing and, then, discuss (all night) afterward.

Other on-line commentators have complimented Scarlett Johansson's performance in Under the Skin. I join them. As mentioned, she emotes like a master actress. She has an extraordinarily intelligent understanding of the script. Other actresses would not understand the central character as well as Johansson obviously does. And, yes, although ScarJo has done violence and nudity before, she does take big risks in this film with those elements. So, she does give a brave performance in that way (I guess). In fact, Under the Skin generally takes risks that way; there are plenty of [parts of the human anatomy] in this film. However, Under the Skin is so much more than the skin presented.

Perhaps, take a look, and enjoy the show.",1405987200,10,3650,4.985221674876847

6314782,5,B00J22YU62,"This film requires a certain love of abstraction, and minimalism, if you hope to enjoy it. The opening title sequence alone, seemed like op art from the Guggenheim. There's very little dialogue.  I remember looking at the DVD player when the first person speaks, and it was almost 18 minutes into the film.  Right away, I thought of the first 18 minutes of 2001 by Kubrick. Or even the imagery of ERAISERHEAD.  Scarlett Johansson plays a beautiful space alien, who entices men who are sexually inexperienced, to her hidden lair. And she sucks them dry.  The imagery of this film is so horrifying, so intense, so bizarre at times, that you will not be able to shake it for days. At one point, a man and his wife and baby are on the seashore. Their dog runs into the crashing waves of the ocean, and the woman swims after the dog, until she's drowning. Then her husband swims out to her, until he's drowning. Then, a guy runs after him and saves him.  He punches the guy, lets him dying on the beach, and goes back into the sea. Meanwhile, their 18 month old baby is alone on the beach, and its dying. And the aliens are going after the guy on the beach who was trying to save the husband, while ignoring the crying baby as if its not there. What can you DO with imagery like that? Its so ALIEN to humanity, and of course, that's the point.  Another bizarre image is how Scarlett goes after this guy, who's 27 years old and hideously deformed.  (Nope, not make up either. Watch the MAKING OF documentary.)

This is art cinema at its finest.  A series of amazing, intense cinematic images, which, if you freeze the film, provides you with constant masterpieces.  Some of the most abstract, layered imagery at times floods the screen, that will affect you, like a nightmare you cant shake, yet makes no sense.  I think Scarlett Johansson played this role with amazing conviction and realism, considering that she is something not remotely human, except in appearance. My only problem with the film, was attempting to understand the Scottish accent, which was so thick, I had very little idea what was being said at times. So you might need captions at times.  Its strange that even the English language is undecipherable in the film.  Certainly a film you'll either love or hate. I loved it.",1405900800,6,2287,4.5623471882640585

Men sometimes perceive only the sex object, the seductive woman that they want to engage sexually. because of her beauty, youth and perceived innocence the assumption is that all the moral foundations exist beneath that veneer of physical attractiveness.  beauty is only but skin deep. throughout the film we slowly witness the character being disturbingly human and becoming vulnerable as she slowly sheds that humanity to reveal her true self.

Be warned, if you're the type of person who requires exposition and closure, stay FAR, FAR away from this film. However, if you don't mind ambiguity and abstruseness and are a fan of art house sci-fi, then absolutely watch this film. I get people criticizing it for being heavy-handed in its critique of the 'human condition.' But if you simply take it for what it is without trying to constantly decipher some deeper meaning, I think the results are more favorable.

Yes, I was completely bewildered at the end, but my next thought was 'damn, I need to see that again.' VERY few movies actually warrant a second viewing as most story arcs are explicit and predictable. This is the type of film that will have you lying awake wondering what in god's name you just watched.

If I had to compare it to anything, it would have to be 2001. Two completely different films, but both portrayed a number of haunting scenes without relying on obligatory slasher film gimmicks (i.e., Event Horizon).

Also, this film manages to achieve a level of visual freshness that few films before it have been able to capture. If nothing else, it's worth seeing for the stunning imagery alone.

No characterization, no dialogue, no plot, no conflict,..there was the smallest amount of suspense: why was Johansson's character doing what she was doing?  Who was she?

Pros: SJ is phenomenal. She is as uninhibited and as mesmerizing as I have ever seen her on film. She will probably get nominated for awards here.

6314799,5,B00J22YU62,"If you have ever seen the film ""man who fell to earth"" staring David Bowie, this film is like a modernized version of it. Much of the film is about the imagery and culture of the times. Everything is gritty and from a very alienating perspective. Things are shot like they are first witnessed, subtle everyday things all of a sudden become mysterious. Old becomes new again, normal becomes haunting, socially acceptable becomes abstract. Our daily lives become a foreign culture shock to us. This film becomes more about seeing through the eyes of a predator alien than it is about a plot. The ambiguous ideas left in the film for viewers to ponder over. It works like a music piece without lyrics, the mood itself tells a story open to interpretation and feelings. Or a painting that elicits thoughts, a painting that gives you hints of a story where you could still appreciate it's beauty and craftsmanship. Beauty and disgust rest in the cinematography. Much like the spiritual realm and god, it's open to interpretation and is consumed in interest and mystery. Under the skin doesn't come across as simply trying to be weird for the sake of being weird, it's trying to be weird to invent something new and innovative. Just about anything mainstream was at one time or another new or strange, it would only make sense a strange film like this comes along every once in a while, more often now than before. The film will make you feel like an insect being slowly eaten by another.

There is very little dialogue and plot within the film. Also there isn't much action or mainstream elements to stimulate an easy access craving audience. Not every ambiguous movie works, Under the Skin works because of mainly the unique imagery, mood, acting, quality craftsmanship, and what thoughts it provokes, it's intent comes across well.

This film is more for an artsy crowd wanting a bit more of a challenging film. If you love this film be sure to pick up ""man who fell to earth"".",1405814400,5,1974,4.702312138728324

6314825,2,B00J22YU62,"Watched it last night. I figured with Scarlet Johannson in it how bad could it be? It was pretty bad. It's interesting to contrast the reviews here with those on IMDB.  On  IMDB - it's an ART FILM. Here it is simple bad sci-fi. I think this site got it right.
The basic storyline (as far as I could tell) - alien creatures are living amongst us. They slip into our skins (after we die or are murdered - I am not sure if they killed the ""human"" ScarJo character). They don't like our food and seem to prefer either not eating at all or assimilating some liquefied form of humans (why humans as opposed to other animals? we don't know). To acquire the humans, they ride around in vans and pick up horney guys.  These are emotionless creatures -  (in one scene they  watch a couple drown and walk away from their screaming baby  - unconcerned and oblivious). Sometimes they can make small talk (like when trying to seduce people on the street) but usually act like they have no idea where they are or what is going on.
Scarlet is beautiful and she remains attractive even playing this emotionless who-the-hell-knows-what-it-is. Yes, she appears naked (or a body double) but as cute as she is, that doesn't make this a good movie.
I will say this - there are a few scenes that are brilliant - the entranced men walking into the dark liquid (or oil or space juice - who knows?) while the she-thing walks across the same surface. Those were creepy, effective and chilling scenes. Maybe the writer had a bad dream and took these scenes directly from that.
What's with the motorcyclists?  Okay, riding sport-bikes extremely fast on rain soaked streets is an interesting visual, but so what - it added nothing to the story, gave no insight to the riders - a  few ""cool looking"" scenes which were probably of no interest to anyone that doesn't ride.
At one point the she-thing picks up a deformed/disfigured guy - the next victim. She spends a little time talking with him and expressing some interest in him but then it's business as usual. Into the oil-pit he goes.  Unexpectedly and we don't know how much time has passed, she  ""frees"" him and lets him walk home. Now, did she release him out of compassion? Or maybe because he was deformed they didn't want any wacky genetic material in their liquid dinner? We don't know and we don't find out.  When the deformed man gets home, it looks like one of the space-bikers captures him, but it is so poorly done you just can't tell for sure.
Some of the story's moments are idiotic - we have an alien race that knows enough about us to learn the language, slip into our skins, function within our society and yet for all their research, they don't seem to know how our reproductive systems work?
The ending scene comes out of nowhere and once again, we learn nothing. Well, we learn that the motorcyclists really, really enjoy riding around trying to get somewhere (all through the ending we see them riding) - but we don't know where or why.
Nothing is explained or revealed at any time. The viewer is an observer and what we observe is a confusing, pointless series of scenes. Not art. Crap.

I don't think I'll be able to shake this anytime soon. It's haunting. I know I won't be able to get that beach scene out of my head. One of the most disturbing scenes in a film that I've seen.

6314833,3,B00J22YU62,"Very artsy and dark, the film, which is loosely based on a book of the same name, sometimes lingers on Scarlet Johnasens austere expressions to the point of fooling you into believing it's a still shot.  The incongruous body with her exaggerated assets, overly large trifocals, and homely features has been replaced with an impassive Scarlett. Truth be told, she does an exceptional job, but the whole idea of the exaggerated features as a lure as well as a means to misdirect shortcomings that could possibly arouse suspicion, were missed opportunities.

Under the Skin is more atmosphere than substance, more skin crawling discernment than heavy handed storytelling. Still, the director applies long drawn out scenes of the Glasgow sprawl. Whether he was conveying human excess or perhaps vulnerability in the wake of something foreign, or the other way around; I'm not sure. I would have much preferred less cautionary panoramas of mundane life and more substantial narrative about the main character and her function.

6314841,4,B00J22YU62,"Yes this is an art film, meaning it is true 'cinema' and not the low-level drama capture so many viewers call 'films'.
Funny how many negative reviews use the term 'art film' or 'artsy' as a pejorative in their review of this picture. Why is that?
It's probably because many of those reviewers are people who consume motion picture media like fast food, expecting what's produced at such places to be the pinnacle of haut cuisine. With movies they appear to have an expectation that everything has to be spelled out and spoon fed in order to enjoy it.
Nothing wrong with that I guess. Simple entertainment and amusement have always been a key goal in the consumption of movies. But art films have always been the bread and butter of motion picture innovation. For those of us who really love motion pictures we have a broad and varied appetite, unlike the slogs that apparently expect every frame in a movie to spell out the obvious in two second cuts.
For every 'Star Wars' there is a 'THX 1138' behind it; for every 'Jaws' there's a 'Seven Ups' that lead the way.
For reviewers that consider 'Transformers' science-fiction they might as well wear a t-shirts that say "" I believe Michael Bay invented Movies"" and leave it at that.
'Under the Skin' is a valid and important picture, just not meant to be consumed and then discarded. Rather it is a work that is meant to be savored as it is viewed, accepting it's aesthetics, ambiguity, and it's perplexity as flavors that are not easily forgotten. Great cinema has the effect of changing one's perspective of living in this world, even just for a moment.

6314855,2,B00J22YU62,"I watched this based on critical acclaim.  My skepticism started with the opening scene.  I think the critical acclaim came from the fact that no one wanted to admit that they didn't understand this really odd, slow paced, pretty much ""it's whatever you decide it is"" type of movie.  I think there are many who gave positive reviews out of peer pressure, I really don't know.  Watch it for Ms. Johansson.  That's it.  Her glammed-down look is stunning.  She really doesn't stretch her acting chops until the end.  The movie's based on a book and I read a review that the movie is a departure from the book, for what it's worth.  The movie has an abstract and, for me, almost '50's beatnik, perform-your-own-poetry kind of feel (at least what I think those might have been like - weird music and nonsensical verse).  The strange background ""music"" helped with that feel.  That's ""music"" not MUSIC.  I haven't read up on how Ms. Johansson became involved, but I applaud her for tackling this departure from the norm.

I actually might give it 2.5 stars for ""sort of okay"".  It might induce someone else to racking sobs, revealing the secrets of the universe to them.  I think it was well done and had some interesting elements.  The main character ""develops"" as the movie progresses.  I can see some irony in what happens at the end (I won't do a plot synopsis, nor drop any spoilers - you can find all this everywhere).  The movie, per se, did absolutely nothing for me.  Even so, I may have become a little more of a Scarlett fan.

What's the point of the movie?  I guess whatever you want it to be.  Watch it if you're curious.  Then, you can write a review dropping high-fallutin' words like ""Kubrick-esque"" that you found on Rotten Tomatoes.... ;o)",1405728000,2,1751,4.5954692556634305

It attempts to detail the manner of confrontation between loneliness and love in the guise of a complete innocent seeking sex. It is depressing, dark and brooding, often demeaning and almost without conscience cliche. There remains little to explore beyond sexual gratification, redemption is rare, and thus we are left with nothing but wondering what the black oil was and the childhood lesson that women should not walk alone in the woods.

be entertaining & intriguing.

The film is dull. The amount of dialogue spoken could, perhaps, fill one paragraph, and there is no real sense of tension, suspense, anything that would make this movie worth watching.

This is a film that has taken nearly 10 years for Director Jonathan Glazer to bring to the big screen, and had Glazer and his crew guerrilla filming north of the Scottish border.

Adapted from Michel Faber's novel of the same name, the film discards virtually all of the book's landscape and the irony of commercial farming. The story of Scarlett Johansson's extra -terrestrial entity begins with an enigmatic ""birth"" sequence from another dimension or other -world. There are faint glimmers of speech hummed through a distorted fog of sound. Then vocalizations repeat and develop and it becomes clear that they're consonants, then syllabic sounds, and finally whole words. The manner in which these enunciations acquiesce into speech is matched by sight of an abstract image of light and a circular shape, which ultimately - in the most intangible way - then form and reveal a human eye.

The alien is then transported to Scotland's grey, rainy streets of what appears to be Glasgow and it - she - has a minder or a familiar for back-up, support, or to ensure she stays on task. His presence is ominous; he wears made-to-measure leathers and rides a R1 Yamaha motorbike. He acquires for her a dead human girl salvaged from the roadside. Or perhaps, this is another expired alien whose shape is being reused? Whatever the case may be, our alien is soon up and running in her white Mercedes Sprint Transit  as she then prowls the Highlands Lowlands.

There is succinct plainspoken interconnectivity between Johansson and men she picks-up, who think she's just a lost lass from South of the border. She comes over as sultry and tempting, with her innocent disarming smile that could be read as being coquettish. However, the alien has one single minded purpose, to sexually entice wide-eyed males who can't trust to their good luck and are quite right not to do so. A film that at times emulates a style of documentary filmmaking; where it combines improvisation, with the use of the camera to expose truth or highlight subjects concealed behind crude realism.

The only sign that the alien is leading men to be harvested for sustenance (but for who or what we are never told) is in an unnerving sequence that shows the sufferers of her seduction. For me Johansson is nothing short of hypnotic in the role as the alien and plays it so very well. There is so little vocal narrative; there are snatches of isolated dialogue. Yet there is a discernible narrative to follow  as we see this through the eyes of the alien, in a montage of menacing images. The scenes where her would be victims are taken (and finally processed, then dispatched into their bare constituents) are astonishing and chilling. All the buildings she uses, as portals to her lair, are derelict and in decay - and yet her unwitting victims follow her into the black inky void. Then of course is the film's extraordinary score, by Mica Levi, which furnishes our predatory alien with her three-note Siren's call. Here then is a real marriage between Levi's score and celluloid, which is both unsettling and yet works so very well.

For me this is a captivating film, but a divisive film, that is not for everyone's tastes as you either love it or hate it.

It almost defies being categorized as sci-fi in that the director's focus is more on Johansson's alien character's attempted assimilation into human society as opposed to her harvesting of healthy unattached men for her intergalactic overlords. Glazer has adapted Michel Faber's more conventional novel into a haunting mood piece filled with images that I'll soon not forget;from the disturbing ""processing"" scene of a male victim to an eerie Scottish coastal sequence where crashing waves and a ghostly fog seem to form an unearthly tunnel. Scarlett Johansson expertly carries the entire film with hardly any dialogue, dramatically evolving from a heartless predator into a sympathetic character whose shocking film-ending fate evokes sympathy. Its disheartening to see all the 1 Star reviews the film is receiving from other reviewers.

The film opening has a faint muffled voice. It is the alien being learning to speak. What appears to be an alien comes to Scotland and tricks men into coming into her world where they can't walk on water. I wasn't sure if this was real science fiction or something like that Jake Gyllenhaal thing and this was just another metaphor for human relations...which it still could have been. The film changes direction about midway.

Scarlett plays an almost robotic alien, very slow and deliberate in her moves. She doesn't know how to respond to many situations. She asks for directions as if she was reading from a foreign phrase manual. As far as Sci-Fi goes in this genre I think ""Phantasm"" was more entertaining and ""Liquid Sky"" more clever.

Her acting was well done, but as far as entertaining, if left something to be desired. Clearly this is not a film for everyone.

Ok, post-pubescent testosterone-driven audiences, go on the internet and find screen caps and then go see TRANSFORMERS for a fifth time, because if that's why you're watching this film, you're going to be one of the haters.

However, if you're in the mood to see a proto-sci-fi film about the allegorical birth, life and death of an unearthly being in a very Kubrickian fashion, UNDER THE SKIN should be a perfect fit for you.

As directed by Jonathan Glazer (SEXY BEAST, BIRTH) the film follows our protagonist, as played by Johansson, as she travels around the Scottish countryside in a white van to seduce men and abduct them for what seem to be extremely nefarious and alien reasons. Almost all of the seduction scenes are set against a completely black backdrop as the men sink into a black abyss all while she's protected and guided by a mysterious motorcyclist. She meets a terribly disfigured young man, and suddenly, this emotionless sexual predator starts to feel things that make no sense to her; feelings like compassion and mercy. This leads her off her mission and into the presence of another man who takes her in, not understanding who she is or what she's capable of. The film ends in on a very strange, almost TWILIGHT ZONE-esque note which is disturbing, but makes a perverted sort of sense when you think about it.

Those who may have read the book might be very upset by this film as it seems to be, at least thematically, quite different. The film is very much about birth, life and death in both a very figurative and literal way. When we first meet our protagonist (none of the characters in the film have names, and much of the dialogue is improvised), she is nude (as the day she was born) and is undressing the body of a recently deceased young woman and putting on her clothes. As she journeys her way through the film, at first, she's just doing exactly what's expected of her, but once she starts to feel a twinge of self-awareness, she begins to stray. In the aforementioned nude scene, she seems to just be examining her body in an entirely unsexualized manner. Of course we're aware of her beauty, but this character isn't. And this plays unusually well to Johansson's strengths as a performer, considering that one of her main strengths, as proven by Spike Jonze's magical HER, is her voice. But she's an extremely physical actress as well, and using her body, face and eyes to let you in makes this one of her best screen performances.

Glazer takes quite a few cues from Kubrick and directs the film with extremely minimal dialogue, with an incredibly unsettling and gorgeous score by Mica Levi, and allows the camera and the character's eyes and body language to tell the story instead. This is bound to be unsettling for viewers who are completely used to a standard linear narrative, and hence, many of the 1-star reviews of this film seem to be from viewers that just aren't on board with this kind of cinematic storytelling. I can't really argue with them; it's a very jarring and unsettling experience and for those who are fed on a strict Hollywood diet, they're going to be upset by this film.

But for those who are willing to take the leap into what is an extremely unusual film experience, UNDER THE SKIN is a modern masterwork of minimalist cinema.",1405555200,344,3426,4.646864686468647

6314898,5,B00J22YU62,"Trippy stuff, seems to be polarizing but as a surface level sci-fi film, without going into meanings that could be derived from everything going on or what it says about life, Under The Skin has more than a couple scenes that will be in the cinematic hall of fame. I've seen a lot of comparisons to other films but with my somewhat limited film vocabulary I felt it was similar to maybe Species and Let Me In/Let The Right One In crossed with a little Beyond The Black Rainbow on my first impression. As a bonus you get a look into modern Scottish society and landscapes, some of it is England though, so that was interesting for someone who has never been there and the thick Scottish accents really helped you feel a little of what Scarlett Johansson's character must have felt as an alien whether it was intentional or not. Plus there are some insightful featurettes totaling about 45 minutes. I don't want to spoil anything major so I'll end it by saying I thought it was better than I imagined it would be even though I was already onboard after seeing previews, and much better than the negative reviews suggested but admittedly it's not for everyone with a fairly strong ""R"" rating but it could have been PG-13 pretty easily with a few well-placed fig leaves.",1405555200,8,1266,4.557017543859649

There is something to be said for leading the audience in and letting them figure out what is going on along the way, but film doesn't even do that.  It is deliberately vague about what is happening and who the character are.

I kept watching expecting something to be revealed or explained or some sort of exposition.  There is nothing.  I can forgive a movie that doesn't have a lot of plot if it has a message, or if it is visually beautiful, or if it makes me feel.  Under the skin did none of these.  Even in rare moments where the characters speak, they say nothing meaningful at all.  I understand the main character is an alien, and her behavior should be alien to us, but she is constantly interacting with humans who don't seem to have any motivation or emotion.  Only one or two of them seems human at all.

The cinematography is is very underwhelming.  It has the feel of a film school project.  Colors are flat an muted.  Lighting is non-existent.  The sound track is a mix of white noise and music that clashes with the scene.

The story of an alien sent to pick up humans to send back to its' planet is confusing, boring, and strange.  Just short of two hours, 'Under The Skin' is an almost dialogue free film (and what little dialogue there is is hard to understand) of darkly-lit, dream like sequences, several featuring fully nude men being led to their demise by Scarlett Johansson (which evidently is a key element to the plot).  I walked away from this movie wondering what had just happened for almost two hours, and what was Scarlett Johansson thinking when she agreed to make this movie.",1405555200,4,651,4.547008547008547

There are some great visual moments, but certainly not worth the difficulty of following & trying to make sense of things on your own.

Most of the Scottish accents were so thick, they should have included subtitles.

The movie is slowly paced, mostly without dialogue.  Silence and sound are used to get your attention.  Sometimes ""graphics"" are used and not explained what they are.  The alien seems able to interact intelligently with it's victim's in order to get them to go along with it's ploy.  So one can assume the alien ""understands"" what it is doing.  And perhaps with that understanding, the alien developed a sense of right and wrong.  It could also be that the alien lived a life of unconnected loneliness and found ""human interaction"" to be something it would rather become a part of, instead of preying on.  Alot of scenes are meant to depict ""something"", but they are not really explained.  I spent the day after watching it, trying to find meaning.  I came to the conclusion, it has none.  You are suppose to give it meaning, according to your perception of the movie.  That I have to give it meaning, makes it the anti-thesis of what movies generally do.  Which is tell us what we should think.  We spend an enormous amount of the movie with the alien, watching it, but we never connect with the alien.  I'm not sure the alien even connected with itself or it's own species.  If the goal was to remove all emotion from a movie, this one comes the closest I have seen.  Can't really say I'm better for having seen it, but I'm no worse either.  Scarlett in all her glory is a beautiful woman.  I give her cudos for choosing this venue to show her body off.  I also think we should recognize that in order to do this movie, she had to show ""no emotion"".  That would be a challenge for any one of us.",1405468800,4,1729,4.391167192429022

Still, this movie has no plot--it wanders.  Its end is absolutely horrible.  The film explains nothing.  No characterization, no motivations, no antagonist, no climax--this film is NOT A STORY.  It is a dream-like succession of interesting and sometimes-beautiful cinematography.

If you have a hard time with Scottish accents, forget this film.  I could hardly understand 90% of the ""dialogue.""  And the men talking don't matter to the plot anyway.  In reality, they were captured by hidden camera and spliced into the film.  Really weird technique that only makes the movie less watchable.

Be warned: There is a lot of nudity.  Scarlett is a beautiful, REAL woman.  Her body is like a healthy ideal for women.  But it gets a bit tiring.  Believe it or not.  And the naked men were not my cup of tea.  Walking into traps with erections.  No thanks.

While the bulk of this movie is absurd and slow and pointless, the STRANGE visual beauty of the film is to be commended.  Even the naked bodies were lighted (or shadowed) interestingly.  The scenes are all creepy and make even the most mundane parts of our world seem alien.

But save it for the art house!  Give us story!  Not a presentation of weird cinema.

Why did I even watched till the last scene?  We learn nothing.  Our heroine accomplishes nothing.  In fact, she nearly SAYS nothing.

Well, the visual weirdness of the movie is like a slideshow.  You begin to realize that you are NOT watching a movie in the traditional sense.  Instead you are just watching art.  Set in a world in which something alien is kidnapping humans.  I think.

Under the Skin makes the book it is based upon seem like the ramblings of an idiot or a drug-addled, paranoid teenager.  I feel bad for the author.  I will not TOUCH that book now.

Something as alarming as an abandoned baby crying sets off an alarm in any human,  but it goes entirely unnoticed by her.  Yet she learns or wants to at least.  Is it compassion that we see develop or is it a desire to experience?  Does she start to feel?",1405468800,8,508,4.229166666666667

Based upon the comments of my friends and colleagues, I expected to have the crap scared out of me.  Sorry to say , I was not.  Now, I do think I know what scared the crap out of THEM.  I am sure these guys would not mind a dalliance with Scarlett, only to find she was the bait to the trap.  Expecting a hot one night stand, only to become lunch.

I did note that some cinematic elements that were clearly from 2001: the long, quiet scenes; the music that was reminiscent of Ligetti's work in 2001; long stares into the elements.

As far as the film is about an alien predator, that is pretty much a cliche', making the entire movie somewhat the same.  The concept of an alien being transformed by the very creatures they prey upon ... also a cliche.  The original Star Trek played upon on this plot device early in its television history.

I read up on the plot of Michel Faber's book of the same name.  I think I will get the book, because it sure sounds more interesting than this film.

So what could interest us in this film?
Plot?  Certainly not, as the plot is well worn and easily recognizable.  If it IS based upon Michel Faber's book, I do not see any intelligence, thought, let alone any satire his book supposedly portrays our society.
Actress? Scarlet nude?  Well, I have to say that nudity in film and subscriber television is so prevalent as to be insufficient to be a shocker, and while she is a remarkable actress, her nudity by no means supplants her acting skill.
The Monster?  The film has a classic nothing approach: we don't see the monster until the end.  To add insult to injury, the monster is almost always destroyed by fire in most gothic films.
Terror? Only for those who are betrayed by their own dark passions.

Where am I most disappointed? I expected to have the crap scared out of me, and all I could do is: ho hum.

6314924,1,B00J22YU62,"Stunning on so many levels, one might even say ""jaw dropping"". Unfortunately, none of those levels are positive ones. I have the sneaking suspicion that the so-called ""10 year"" period it took to complete this movie was broken into three segments... 21 1/2 minutes to come up with the plot, the meaning, the characters, the dialogue, the subplots, the motivations, find some paper, put it in the printer, write the entire script, pour out several celebratory drinks and roundly toast each for their special genius... 1 year to hire everyone, find locations, build sets, shoot the principal photography, shoot the inserts, then edit the whole film 20 times in the hopes of finding a movie.... include then the initial 9 years of trying to find a studio, group, or individual who did NOT run screaming from the building when the movie was pitched to them and the script revealed - and viola! - Instant Labor of Love, Ten Years in the Making.

What is being heralded by many here as ""brilliant"" is merely a rehash of the juvenile pulp that fueled so many short-lived SF monthly magazines of the 1930's - aliens come to Earth, hide among us, lure and entrap us, then eat us (or digest us in some fashion) - but eventually get their well-deserved-but-somehow-sad comeuppance.

This flotsam floated many a mag for several years (witness the small SF mag empire of publisher/editor Hugo Gernsback - yes, the one they named the Hugo Award for). Of course, he ran the very first SF story (""Ralph 124C 41+"") which he wrote himself in one of his first magazines, ""Modern Electrics"". It has been described by top SF authors as a ""tawdry illiterate tale"",a ""sorry concoction"" (Brian Aldiss) and ""simply dreadful"" (Lester del Rey) - words curiously apropos to the movie under discussion, I'm afraid. And I'm also afraid I'm firmly in these author's camps when it comes to poorly conceived and executed stories - especially that of the movie in question, starring an improving Ms. Johansson but otherwise merely masquerading as a film.

There's a test that can be applied, one that is used in nearly every film class in America. Whether the film is an idiotic comedy, a tense drama, or something utterly avant garde and cerebral, it's a test that measures the the truth and craftsmanship of the project against ITSELF, and therefore has great validity even though it might p**s off a dedicated fan no end.

It's simply this: Look at each individual sequence of the film, mull it over until you know everything you can know about it. Then ask yourself one question - Is this sequence necessary to the film's existence? (Does it move the film forward, or explore and reveal character, or provide new information or back story, or provide a setup for what's coming?) If the answer is ""no"", the sequence, however pretty, is superfluous and harms the film. Too many of these (maybe 10% of the film) and the film is flawed. An overabundance (maybe 20%) and the film becomes unwatchable to anyone but fans.

Agree or disagree, it's nonetheless the way the human mind works, and the way that filmmakers must work if they hope to create something that can aspire to the title of ""Art"" - for ""Art"" is determined by the VIEWER and not by the artist. Anything else is hyper indulgence, ""arting around just for the sake of arting around"", and a way to get certain actors to say ""oooh, that's cool, yeah, let's do that!"" and make yourself popular with undisciplined or untrained performers.

My personal estimation (just my own) is that ""Under the Skin"" is almost 80% non-essential sequences. Which qualifies it for a place up front in the ""Disaster"" file. It reeks of director/writer ""oooh, that's so cool, let's do that - they'll NEVER figure it out!"", while at the same time it forces the actors to hang onto the director's ""vision"" instead of a literate script - a script that doesn't exist, but is desperately needed if they're to make sense out of what they're doing internally as actors. ""Oooh, hey, Scarlett - I gotta great idea... why don't you try doing THIS!!?"" is not, repeat not, the best or even a tolerable use of an actor's gift.

""But it's cinema verite!"" some might puff. Well, just keep in mind that the cinema verite style was invented by Jean Rouch, a Frenchman, and that the French agree on one thing only when it comes to ""cinema"" - the greatest film genius, the greatest director/actor who ever lived is.... Jerry Lewis. (For those unfamiliar with this odd fact, it's true - look it up.)

A last point... For a film to make an impact that, as some suggest here, will keep people discussing it far into the future, even launch it into the realm of Citizen Kane or Stanley Kubrick, it must first actually BE a film, not just an exercise in reanimating discarded non-classic stories of the 1930's. ""Citizen Kane"" had Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz writing it, ""2001"" had Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. Maybe a total of 20 recognized masterpieces, both written and filmed, came out of these people. ""Under the Skin"" has Jonathan Glazer and Walter Campbell... lots of music videos, even more commercials, and two very minor films in the last 14 years.  Oh, yes - and now ""Under the Skin"".

I have been looking hard at my vast collection of silk purses and sow's ears. Much as I try, I just can't seem to imagine one suddenly turning into the other.

And now I'm going to go to the living room and watch any Liam Neeson movie I can lay my hands on. Which will wash this one away, get rid of the taste, and make me feel better. So there.

It's an adaptation, and a really loose one at that. The focus is on the imagery and eerie soundtrack to evoke an alien sent to Earth to hunt humans for meat that's sent back to her home planet. The subtexts about class inequality and sexual politics aren't there, so don't bother complaining about how this apple isn't an orange.

Many people have given this film terrible reviews mainly because we live in a society that wants faced paced films. This film is not one of those but it is an artistic masterpiece. Let's not forget many people hated ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" when it first came out and now consider it one of the best films ever made.

If you read about this film we're told she's an alien who grows more human as the story unfolds, but I don't think we have to be forced to take the film that literally, and besides, aside from the strangeness of the whole experience there's nothing in this film to suggest anything science fiction. I kept thinking about failed relationships and the difficulty we can have in connecting with other people. I mean, what is it exactly that drives us to be with other people anyway? Why do we have that need, beyond the obvious biological need?

Almost all of her interactions come from needing help, real or lies. She asks strangers for help getting somewhere, the man on the bus asks her if she needs help, the men on the street pick her up and ask her if she needs help, the baby cries out for help, the motorcycle man helps clean up ... it's that help we need from each other that can bring us together. But isn't a lot of that help also selfish? How do we repay that help? Why should we repay that help? What are the consequences of helping or not repaying help?

And what does a person look like who never honestly reaches out to other people and helps them? What black heart would they have under their skin?

A lot of questions and a lot to ponder here, and that's why I liked it. I'm glad there are people in this world who want to make movies like this.",1405209600,19,1625,4.406666666666666

WTH just happened??? Oh no you di-n't just end this movie!
There were almost NO questions that were raised in the movie answered. I mean, even in movies that are made with the intention of creating sequels afterward, there are SOME questions answered; SOME explanations. I've felt like those are complete movies, even though there's a cliffhanger. Not so for me with this movie.
Was this a film class assignment to create mood and a complete a story wasn't required? Could Jonathan just not decide on what direction for the story to go in or ran out of time and so just made up the excuse that it was a an artistic decision to withhold the rest of the story? Or is there some deep philosophical reason or inference that I am not smart or knowledgable enough to grasp? Hell, I don't know.
Alright, now I'm going to calm down for a minute and be fair.
The mood and the artistry, including the acting, set design, and timing were masterful, I thought. Engaging, interesting, and here and there, even beautiful. No doubt. Maybe even Stanley-Kubrick-ish with a little of the well, beauty, and artistry of American Beauty, some of the starkness of Fargo, and a tad of the gory freakiness of The Cell. Yes, the mood and style were well done.
And while I might have imagined a more classic model-like appearance of the main character - with more angular features to reflect the sometimes seemingly emotionless state of the character - rather than the soft, voluptuous, vulnerable Scarlett Johansson - she is convincing. I really admire her work in this movie. She didn't have a lot of dialog, yet she seemed very skilled at conveying the character.
I imagine that the general audience might not like this movie because of the incomplete story (I could be wrong), but obviously, sci-fi junkies like me will want to see it, even if they are irritated by it.
If there's a sequel, I will definitely watch it. But Jonathan better pony up on the story, or I might not forgive him.",1405123200,2,2009,4.646067415730337

All I knew was that Scarlett Johansson was playing some kind of alien who abducts men in Scotland. It turned out to be quite a bit more than that, although the snail's pace at which the film unfolded was a little taxing for me at times. Jonathan Glazer is an outstanding visualist and this film has some rather haunting combinations of images and music that create an unnerving atmosphere. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job as the enigmatic main character. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue in this film, which could put off some viewers, but sometimes what one sees is as or more important than what one hears. I'm not really sure how to describe what happens in the film at the risk of spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that you'll be rewarded if you can make it until the end. Stylistically, it reminded me a bit of a sci-fi film I watched before called BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW, inasmuch as the atmosphere created by the visuals and music combined are similar. Overall, I thought it was a decent film, although one that I'll probably wait awhile to watch again.

6314951,5,B00J22YU62,"Warning: This film contains some very disturbing ideas and imagery. This is intentional and adds to the film, but if you can't stomach that kind of thing, don't buy this.

Warning to anyone who likes the novel: This is not a strict adaptation of the novel. Sure some of the flavor is there, like the woman picking up random men in Scotland. Some of the story beats are similar to the novel. Other than that, this is completely different from the novel.

Warning to anyone interested in traditional movie storytelling: This is a very non-traditional film. It draws some deserved comparisons to Kubrick's 2001. There is very little dialog. Almost everything is told with imagery and symbolism.

So if you are looking for an adaptation of the novel or you want a traditionally told story where characters verbally tell you what the plot is, you should probably avoid this movie.

That said, I love this movie. Its unique imagery sticks with me long after I saw it. I find myself wanting to watch it again to dig up more of the hidden secrets the film has to offer. The director/writer Jonathan Glazer achieves this with very little dialog. In fact, most of the dialog is only used by the predators to lure in their prey.

For anyone willing to dig deeper and understand the meaning of each image presented, you can experience a story in almost an entirely visual basis. And what an interesting story it is. By presenting the way humans appear to the aliens we get some insight into how fragile we are as a species.

The aliens in this movie have processes and behaviors that are very inhuman and disturbing. Too me, this strange, trance-like surreal film-making fits perfectly with how alien life would appear to us humans.

There is a meta layer to this film for those that are interested in how it was made. The shooting of this film is very predatory and is done in a candid camera approach. This adds more meaning, to me, knowing that some of the men featured in this film were ""seduced"" with the prospect of being in a movie.",1405123200,13,2027,4.598337950138504

Scarlett's staring off into space mannerisms actually made the movie and encaptuated the audience just like she did to the men. the ending shot when we see that her skin covering her alien body is ripped and that her attempted rapist sees this too is heartbreaking. and when she looks at the face of the alias skin she was using you can see how shocked and saddened she is knowing her time is up. her death by burning into the flames felt just like my mind did when the end credits rolled I felt not only lost and confused but a little annoyed at the unanswered questions. this movie really had no plot and was disturbing with the naked elephant man and the little baby deserted to die on the beach. I did notice the symbolisms of the dark and light themes of the movie. her pupil being the darkness that seductes the men into the floor. it had so much potential but left you hanging too much. still enjoyed it. it's the type of movie you probably get stoned to and invite a bunch of friends over to watch and to freak them out ;),1404864000,,1555,4.239057239057239

If I was walking alone on a road in the dead of night and a white van that looked suspiciously like the ones child molesters and rapists drive pulled up alongside me and it was revealed that Scarlett Johansson was behind the wheel, dressed like a prostitute, and she began to inquire about my home life, where I was from, if I lived with anyone (that sort of thing) and then she offered me a lift and we wound up back at her place, I would pretty much know that I was about to die and yet I would still readily walk inside, take off all my clothes, and strut my stuff.

Its Scarlett Johansson.  You don't say no; ever.

All joking aside, the above paragraph is pretty much what happens for the first half of this film and yet for some reason it still works in a way that completely entranced me and has me thinking that Ive finally seen the first REAL masterpiece of 2014.

This has been a long time coming for me.  There were so many things riding on the success of this film, at least for this film lover.  First, you had the return of Jonathon Glazer.  The man has produced two films since his debut, Sexy Beast, in 2001, and while I don't think that Birth (his sophomore film) was the outstanding masterpiece everyone calls it, the atmosphere he created and honest potential he displayed was undeniable.  Ive been craving more from him for TEN YEARS and yet he merely teased us with this film for the last two years, promising it to us and yet withholding it until now.  Second was the inevitable return of Scarlett Johansson to the good graces of the cinephile community.  I love this girl, and back in 2003 I christened her the best new thing to happen to cinema.  Then she became a sex symbol and the world forgot she could act.  Shes been steadily proving her chops over the past two years, and this panicle of awesomeness has finally pushed her back over the edge.

You cant deny her talent any longer.

But, above all else, I just really wanted Under the Skin to be a great movie.  Isnt that the most we can ask of any film; to be good?  I have not read the novel, although its been on my shelf since 2011, when I first heard that this film was in the making, but I have heard nothing but stellar things for it.  In fact, Ive heard that the novel was such a defining moment in the genre that many fans were afraid it was unfilmable.

It appears that Glazer doesnt know what that means.

I think the first thing to understand about Under the Skin going in is that the film kind of defies formulaic plot structure.  It isn't a linier story in the sense that you may expect.  It does have a clear beginning and end, but the middle kind of goes in and out of a direct storyline, and rightfully so.  The films clear intent on developing a dreamy, otherworldly atmosphere, is key to the development of the themes presented, and without them this would have fallen into the genre traps the keep so many other films grounded in a place of mediocrity.  Instead, Glazer flips us all the bird and constructs something that feels like David Lynch attempting to make a Terrence Malick film.  It is stunning to look at, independent of dialog (as in, it doesnt need it even though it has some), richly spiritual and absolutely insane.

To sit here and try and uncover all of the tasty tidbits produced by this film would take all day and be somewhat counterproductive, since so much of the understanding and appreciation of the film comes from that subjective light that we as cinephiles call our opinions, but I wanted to express one aspect of the film that I found to be a beacon shining over what were by expectations.

Under the Skin says a lot about human nature without ever once telling us a thing about it, if that makes sense.  Instead of resorting to those James Cameron force-fed clich&eacute;s of HUMANS RUIN EVERYTHING SO ALIENS MUST INTERVENE, Glazer allows the visual identity of his film to tell his story for him.  In the development of character in his protagonist (antagonist?), the seductive alien (no one in this film has a name), we see a creature with a purpose who acts like a machine, without sympathy or any real emotion whatsoever, who is betrayed by her own mission when she starts to observe the people around her and become transfixed by the potential for good in humans.  It is through this observance that her guard is weakened and she is won over by her prey and eventually disregards her own journey for another path entirely, only to find out that nothing is black and white.

The finale is a jarring look at how we can condemn ourselves through an act of ignorance.

This year has been so rich with films that develop complex themes through a subtle air and craft such through provoking tales that leave us all grasping for different answers, showing how important and how impactful film (and storytelling) can be.  Enemy, Noah, Under the Skin; three vastly different films with VERY different stories that all prove that less is more and nothing is what it seems.

1.) someone has a  GREAT sense of  Humor via  sarcasm about the ""MOVIE""

2.)  This movie was every 14 year old boy ""SCI-FI"" dream to have an alien take the form of a HOT ACTRESS to watch her naked, or for the 26 year old living in mom and dads basement....I tend to believe this was a confused childhood erotica sci-fi dream after his first hangover and don't understand what just happened...

This could have been a really good movie the premiss was sound but the screenplay and directing  was terrible,

This looked like an ART project with RICH daddy's money for equipment only and absolutely no clue about MOVIES or acting

It would be great if we had a director and writer to make a movie that the people act like regular people...Scarlett was not the norm in this flik and yet everyone around her acted like she was normal

although I think less dialog in today's movies would be great, this movie could have benefited from some dialog

As I watched this it was almost like a REALLY BAD knock off of a Stanley Kubrick movie, even the music was an attempt to rip-off Kubrick....Most Kubrick movies had the ability to pull you into the movie, to be part of it, to feel as though it was you in the movie, At no point did this movie do anything and was at most times FLAT OUT BORING....This is from someone that is not into all the Graphics and looks to  hear from the actor really acting

this movie is a total mess, it's almost like they told Johansson to just walk around and drive vehicles and then let the camera roll for a couple hours and then that was the finished product

6314993,5,B00J22YU62,"""Under the Skin"" was pure pleasure to watch--and be awed by.  The craftsmanship of this film rewards multiple viewings.  It contains some of the most vivid,evocative, and outrageous imagery I've seen in years.  If Kubrick and H.P. Lovecraft collaborated on a movie, this is what they could have made together.

The story is simple enough.  An alien being, played by Scarlett Johansson, dresses up as a beautiful woman to troll the dark and depressing streets of Scotland and lure men back to her place.  There, in a claustrophobic black pool, something unspeakable happens to her victims.  What, exactly, happens to these men is left to the viewer to decide, in one of many deliciously open-ended moments in the film--but clearly it is something that pulverizes them both body and soul.  Later, as she spends more time among the humans, she begins to feel more human--perhaps out of curiosity, perhaps as a by-product of wearing a human appearance.  She develops a sort of empathy and compassion for the human species, and even a desire for human love.  Ironically, her innocence of humanity's own predatory streak leads the film to its shocking conclusion.

The appeal of this film is evident in the way it builds something truly original out of one of the most over-used cliches in science fiction--aliens preying on humans.  Glazer's style has rightfully been compared to Kubrick's.  But this film also reminded me of Jean Cocteau's ""Orpheus,"" with its odd evocation of death as a voluptuous woman (accompanied by motorcyclists!), trips through mirrors into other worlds, etc.

One last example of what impressed me about this film, that will show off its strength in simplicity.  Near the beginning, the alien played by Scarlett Johanssen descends an escalator into a mall full of people.  Somehow, we are seeing the sounds and sights of the mall crowd through alien eyes, as though we had never seen them before, as though humanity were some strange and unknown quantity.  Fantastic.  Then she goes to the cosmetics counter, where women are getting their faces done.  Somehow, this harmless activity suddenly takes on an eerie and uncanny feeling, as though the human women were also somehow alien, donning a disguise by modifying their faces.  The whole film has this sort of strange, uncanny feeling--these are just two examples.

Not everyone will be ""into"" this film, as evidenced by the bad reviews here, but if you can let the imagery work its way into your subconscious, I think you will find it a rewarding experience.",1404000000,14,2531,4.992840095465394

The film was disturbing and scary.  The sound effects and musical score in addition to the minimalist dialog were excellent in setting this overall tone.
I have not read the book. The movie was a science fiction movie which also had a societal comentary on the effects of portraying woman as sex objects which was thankfully accomplished without being at all in your face preachy.

6314999,5,B00J22YU62,"I'd heard various reactions to this film before watching it, some very positive, some negative, both commenting on how confusing and strange it was. David Lynch's 'Eraserhead' was the most popular comparison. While I think any attempts at comparison are going to fall well short of the mark, I'll say that 'Under the Skin' is a slow-burning SF-Horror film that's closer to Kubrick's meditative pace on '2001', with the realistic, semi-improvised dialogue of Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant' and 'Gerry'.

{**SPOILERS**}
Scarlett Johanssen plays one of two aliens who has taken human form. Just how alien they are cannot be fully appreciated until the second or third 'seduction'. After picking up a stranger in her non-descript van, she brings him to a dilapidated rural house. Leading her would-be suitor into utter blackness, she leaves a trail of clothes behind as she undresses; the unfortunate victim stumbles forward, oblivious to the impossible metamorphosis of the floor beneath his feet as he sinks into the black, like a sabertooth tiger chasing its' prey into a tar pit. Fully submerged in a viscous, translucent oil, other figures are visible... and so is she, somehow walking across the surface meters above. In a particularly haunting moment, two victims try to make sense of what's happened to them, and reach out to clasp hands in desperation, before one of them implodes in a shockingly violent manner that leaves nothing but his skin behind, like a discarded wrapper.

The black liquid is the alien life-form, 'digesting' humans and absorbing their consciousness along with their bodies. With each instance, she becomes more and more human. From an insectoid disregard for human suffering, she eventually appears to take pity on one of her would-be victims, letting him free. But when the male alien hunts him down and kills him, cleaning up her mess like a worker drone, she leaves on her own, and ends up in a relationship with a kind-hearted man who takes her for a girl on the run... which she is, sort of. Things take a disquieting turn for all parties, resulting in a violent conclusion for the mock-human that has shaped itself from the communal form/intellect of the black liquid. This, however, is just one interpretation. Director Jonathan Glazer deliberately strays from the more concrete narrative of Michel Faber's novel, allowing the viewer to use the spare audio-visual data as they wish, a tactic which allows varied opinions on what it all means. This refusal to spell things out definitively has inspired something close to outrage in some viewers, a righteous indignation all out of proportion to the film's supposed faults.

Under the Skin is mesmerizing at times, with beautiful cinematography that makes certain sequences, the 'black widow' scenes in particular, seem dreamlike or hallucinatory. But as far as truly strange films go, this is nowhere near the top of the list. In some ways it's actually quite simple; but Glazer's conscious decision to forgo the signposts and signifiers that usually accompany science fiction requires a certain level of personal interpretation that some people obviously find off-putting. I enjoy watching a film that requires more from its audience, providing small islands of imagery and narrative separated by open water that the viewer must navigate alone. My own ideas about the story are easily summarized: an incredibly alien form and intelligence produces two doppelgangers by reshaping itself, and sends them out to acquire experimental subjects/food. As the female doppelganger spends time in this new world and new body, it begins to develop the qualities of an human individual... until it hits a wall, so to speak.

While I didn't find the film confusing, and I don't think it possesses the complexity of Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, both of which are like Russian Nesting Dolls of narrative and meaning, Under the Skin is certainly open to multiple interpretations. Director Jonathan Glazer has created an ambiguous and poignant science fiction art film, which is always dangerous territory. The few examples that exist, however -- 2001, The Moon, Solaris -- usually take advantage of the existential nightmares and metaphors that space travel so readily implies (the womb, birth, death, nothingness, nihilism, isolation, etc.). Under the Skin takes the viewer into terra incognita, gives us a glimpse of the truly alien as it absorbs, and is finally absorbed by, humanity.

One of the other comments that surprised me after seeing it suggested that 'Scarlett Johansson must really regret doing this movie'. I hope not. I don't think there's anything to regret about Under the Skin. I'm a huge Lynch fan, and this is not imitation-Lynch. This is a quietly disturbing look at humanity through alien eyes, and it's one of the most unique and haunting fims I've seen in a while.

Johansson made it robotic, but in the end vulnerable. If you are not familiar with Scottish brogue, you will understand about 20% of the dialogue which makes up about 2% of the story. Needless to say, there is very little dialogue. If you like films with a lot of action and dialogue, don't bother. If you like a super spooky score and some film-noir, check it out.",1403913600,4,866,4.319018404907975
6315006,5,B00J22YU62,"A subtle tale of murder, lustful longing, and understanding loneliness, ""Under The Skin"" is a must-see for fans of films by David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock. Scarlett Johansson is transcendent in the role of an alien life form that seduces human males and then devours their flesh within the darkness of her hearth. You'll be utterly convinced of Johansson as a sociopath and predator. Her interactions with her prey were shot with non-actors using hidden cameras while she drove across Scotland picking up random men in a non-descript white van. The film score is unsettling much in the way the soundtracks for Kubrick's films tended to be. And the art direction employed by the director, Jonathan Glazer, again recreates a sense of surrealistic realism that made his last film ""Birth"" so strangely plausible. Overall, I thought it was a brilliant commentary on human sexuality through an alien eye by using the plot device of the femme fatal to approach the subject of sexual violation through interchanging gender roles. I am now a Glazer fan for life. Five Stars. An Instant Classic.",1403913600,9,1087,5.011049723756906

This may be rare, but I buy/watch movies based on the actors/actresses rather than the plot.  Obviously, it's hit or miss since not all can be blockbusters.  This one was definitely a miss.  As some posters have already mentioned, there is very little dialogue, a whole lot of SJ looking blankly into space, heavy Scottish accents, and unfortunately a lot of nude men scenes.  The only consolation was that SJ displayed herself in all her glory in a few scenes.  I understand that the female alien role, that SJ played, had a self awareness awakening towards the end, but the journey getting there was excruciating and the ending landed with a dull thud.

I must add that the Scottish landscapes and other scenes of life in the UK were spot on.  I lived in the UK for 5 years and it brought back many memories of the mostly dismal weather and the Mom and Pop grocery stores complete with bland food - God Bless America!

This is a film about perspective and texture - both visually and musically. There is an 'other worldly' feeling that I found refreshing. I very much appreciate directors and writers who don't go by the usual 'Hollywood' standard. I can see why some would compare the long shots with Kubrick, but I think this was somehow different... and in some ways better. Needless to say, on second thought... I shall say it: Ms Johansson was terrific. I've heard the book that this is based on is excellent... and I'll look it up to read. If you are looking for a sexy movie or an 'Alien' sequel, I'd suggest you look elsewhere... this is not an action movie.

It's probably shot in a very short time and Scarlett and Tom were laughing all the way to the bank with that  big pay check only to have the viewers left to think WTF were they thinking making this?
For the ""artsie"" folks out there you find this to be interesting, but the facts are this movie has no dialogue I don't think Hardy says 1 word in the whole movie, so the plot is pretty much made up as they went it's kind of like making fun of the big dollar movies that actually have a people writting to make the movie interesting and make sense also.

6315015,5,B00J22YU62,"This movie knocked me on my ass. It's one of those miracles of cinema that does so much with so little that I can't help but applaud its virtues. On the surface it looks and feels that the narrative is thin at best, but as the movie goes along it gradually reveals it's thematic layers on the nature of humanity, what does it mean to be human? Is kindness a universal shared trait that transcends species classification. The neurons in my head were exploding while I was watching this. Scarlett Johanson...woah! She has always been eye candy to me, not much of an actress in the prior roles I've seen of her, but boy does she knock this one out of the park. This is by far the best thing she has ever done as an actor. Yes the selling point is that she gets nude in this, but underneath the surface there is a lot of tension brewing within her which ultimately makes the movie very suspenseful and quite moving in the end, she honestly blew me away with this performance. Don't be fooled, this is not some impenetrable indie art house flick, it has the appearance of one, but this ultimately is a very accessible film that leaves you thinking about it for days afterward. Mark my words this will be a cult classic. Scar Jo will be at conventions talking to fans about her experience making this. I'm not ready to put it on the top of my list so far for best of 2014, but it's up there. This is a keeper. Smart, intelligent sci fi with a beating heart.",1403740800,9,1451,4.299270072992701
6315016,1,B00J22YU62,"I waited eagerly for this film to come out.  The book was fabulous on so many levels. It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.

Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.
In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets.

This is a worthless boring straight to video movie at best. Honestly, I question the 5 star reviews only because it doesn't make any sense how anybody could say it's great and be honest. I really wanted to like this when I saw the trailer. I gave it a shot and was VERY angry that I was suckered into watching this by using her as the reason. Her being nude is not a valid reason for you watching a movie for entertainment purposes unless this was a porn. Then you have a excuse. I wish when I read the negative reviews that I had listened.

6315024,4,B00J22YU62,"What the hell did I just watch? That was the first thoughts that passed through my mind as I left the theater after watching Jonathan Glazer's sci-fi film Under the Skin. Many thoughts and emotions passed through my mind while I watched Under the Skin that include wonder, frustration, hate, love, what am I watching, what is the reason why Glazer added that to the film, why, and many other thoughts and emotions, and I can understand why there is such a divided opinion over the film between the top critics along with the general audience. Under the Skin is one of those films that I believe people will either hate or love, and after thinking about the film for nearly a week weighing the negative against the positive I am in the latter category in that I have ended up loving Under the Skin as it is perhaps the most original film I have seen in decades.

What is there to say about the plot as there isn't much of one. The film follows two unnamed creatures that I believe are aliens in Scarlett Johansson and a guy riding a motorcycle who for some reason is following the unnamed woman around. The film follows Johansson's character as she travels around Scotland luring men into her truck, and taking them to a secluded location where they are trapped and I guess processed for some unknown reason that the film never explains. Through her journey Johansson's unknown women finds humanity especially after she picks up a disfigured man that she ends up letting go that leads to a heart wrenching yet terrifying climax.

The plot written by Jonathan Glazer and Walter Campbell is at times absolutely brilliant as is with a scene by the Scottish Coast where Johansson meets a surfer and in the background a family is playing in the ocean that leads to a terrifying conclusion, but at other times doesn't make a lick of sense like the other alien creature riding the motorcycle. I still don't know what the purpose was for the guy. The character wasn't really needed in the film who just seemed to follow his fellow unnamed alien around cleaning up messes that weren't really necessary, especially since Johansson's alien was the most important aspect of the film. There was also the passing of the film that was at times dull, but the positive far outweighs the negative as Glazer's script and film is the most original film I have seen since the likes of Looper and Inception, and perhaps the most original film I have seen in over a decade as Under the Skin delves into what it means to be human, the human identity and what it means as well as loneliness and love. Along with Glazers frustrating yet brilliant script the director smartly uses visuals as well as the gorgeous beauty of Scotland to bring meaning and life to his original film and along with the eerie and dark score by Mica Levi would make Under the Skin one of the best films of the year, but I haven't gotten to brilliant star in Scarlett Johansson. Johansson deserves a lot of credit for taking on a daring role where she has perform fully nude for a few scenes yet the actress gives subtle and brilliant performance with limited dialogue relying more on body language and facial expressions for her performance making Under the Skin one of the most original, unique and best films I have seen this year and in years.

I know some will absolutely love Under the Skin while others will hate it, and I wish I could go into more detail about the film, but you have to experience the weirdness and beauty of the film that make Under the Skin a film that shouldn't be missed. That along with a slightly flawed script and methodical pacing, some really good visuals, and absolutely beautiful cinematography along with a great score and a brilliant performance by the gorgeous and Oscar worthy actress in Scarlett Johansson make Under the Skin a must see film in 2014. Watching Under the Skin audiences may love the film or not, and they may not understand what they are seeing or the themes of the film, but I can guarantee viewers of Under the Skin will have seen nothing like what they have watched in Under the Skin before.",1402444800,14,4098,4.580381471389646

6315026,5,B00J22YU62,"This movie is not for everyone. It demands patience and concentration. For the director, it is a work which involved 10 years in the making. As you watch this film, it becomes evident that each scene has been the subject of much thought and consideration.

For those who enjoy this genre of film, it is an extraordinary and rewarding experience. Others would find it a chore to sit through this complex allegorical tale for 108 minutes.

Jonathan Glazer has crafted a remarkable work of original motion picture art, with the collaboration of Scarlett Johansson, who delivers a stunning performance in a complex role as an alien whose mission is to kidnap men for consumption by her race. Her role was made additionally challenging as several scenes involved improvisation, with Ms Johansson engaging numerous unwitting persons to become participants in the movie.

The music by Mica Levi is atmospheric, haunting and disturbing.

Daniel Landin's cinematography is excellent- whether it is capturing the beauty of Scarlett Johansson and the Scottish countryside, filming from a point of view perspective or meeting the challenge of filming covertly. The cinematography effectively conveys the mesmerising ambience and the emotion of the story.

The story is told in a mesmerising fashion- the jigsaw pieces of the tale are disclosed one by one until the full picture is revealed.
Interestingly, part of the filming of the movie involved the unknowing participation of men who were propositioned by Scarlett Johansson as she was driving a van. Covert cameras in the van captured their reaction to being approached by a beautiful and mysterious woman. The unwitting participants were told about the filming afterwards.

In much the same way, the audience is taken on a journey where the multiple layers of the story are lifted one by one, until the final denouement. Johansson's (unnamed) character develops during the film, evolving from being a dispassionate hunter through to learning and experiencing human compassion, desire and vulnerability, acceptance by and assimilation with humanity, then ultimately metamorphosing (like the insects she finds fascinating) from being the hunter to prey and on to being a victim of cruelty and ignorance.

There are fine observations and explorations of the nature of humanity- both good and bad - including compassion, vulnerability, mercy, pity, altruism, survival, desire, lust, cruelty and ignorance. And, the director makes some pointed observations about ""skin"" - society's fascination with the outer envelope of physical appearance.

I have read that others have compared this movie to the works of Kubrick- I thought that there are some comparisons to be made with ""2001- A Space Odyssey"". As I was watching it, some scenes vaguely reminded me of Tony Scott's ""The Hunger""- however, the stories are quite different. At times, I could see parallels with Nicholas Roeg's ""The Man who fell to Earth"". And, I thought the sympathetic killer theme was reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""Psycho""*. Luc Besson's ""Nikita"" also came to mind.**

Nonetheless, this is an original artistic work, which stands on its own creative merits, and which I suspect will become the subject of critical analysis by film students.

This is a quite remarkable movie- very rewarding and worthwhile for aficionados of this artistic genre.

*An unusual coincidence: Scarlett Johansson's character is a sympathetic killer; in ""Hitchcock"", she portrayed the actor who played the victim of one of the screen's best known sympathetic killers- Norman Bates in ""Psycho"".
**Another coincidence: Ms Johansson is starring in M. Besson's ""Lucy"".

6315027,4,B00J22YU62,"""Under The Skin"" (2013 release from Scotland; 108 min.) brings the story of several aliens (one man, one woman) whom we see take the shape on a human. The woman, played by Scarlett Johansson, starts picking up one guy after another, leading them to her house where she ""takes care of business"" (how? I'm not going to spoil). Eventually the woman tries to fit better in and even tries getting into a 'real' relationship. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is the latest movie from British director Jonathan Glazer, best know for bringing us ""Sexy Beast"" some years ago. His previous movie ""Birth"" was also a take on things that are not quite your normal situation, but here he goes one better, and then some. Second, the science fiction tone of the movie is brought expertly, from the opening scenes where we're not sure what exactly is happening, it looks to be something in space like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Third, there are a number of stunning, if at times unsettling, scenes, including the extended beach scene, and the scene with the 26 yr. old virgin guy. Fourth, the movie is set in Scotland, and while we get glimpses of some of its beauty, the overall feeling is pretty grey and grim, and hence not necessarily an inviting ""postcard from Scotland"" (in contrast to that other seminal Scottish film from 30 years ago, ""Local Hero""). Fifth, there is a very abstract soundtrack that matches the movie perfectly, scored by British artist Mica Levi (a/k/a Micachu). Last but certainly not least, what can you say about the performance from Scarlett Johansson. Yes, there is nudity, and quite a bit of it, but far more important is the astonishing way in which she portrays the alien. By coincidence, she is currently in the theatres also with another science-fiction movie, albeit one of a very different kind, namely ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", which I have no interest in seeing. I'm sure she collected a big check for that movie, and if that is what allows her to take on more challenging indie roles such as this movie and ""Don Jon"", then I'm all for it. I guess I wasn't quite sure what to expect from ""Under The Skin"", but I can tell you that was I saw far surpassed whatever expectations I had, including an unforgettable ending.

I saw ""Under The Skin"" at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee showing I saw this at was not particularly well attended, but that could just as much be a reflection of the very nice weather outside. Either way, if you are in the mood for the antithesis of that other current science fiction movie starring Johansson, you cannot go wrong with ""Under The Skin"", which is a very original, if at times creepy, but never boring sci-fi. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1401753600,126,2840,4.68937875751503
6315028,5,B00J22YU62,"I have to say so far this is the movie of the year for me. The second movie of the year will more than likely be ""The Scribbler"" with Katy Cassidy.  This movie was so artistically done and the cinematography was so beautiful. It reminded me of a cross between a David Lynch film and some of David Cronenberg's older material. The first half of the movie was basically her having zero morality for mankind even children. The second half of the film she becomes depressed and doesn't understand what her place is on this earth. She also finds a respect for human life and tries to live like us. Even tries to mate with our kind and finds she doesn't have the reproductive organ for it. From there she becomes even more depressed and tries to find solace alone.

  The seduction scenes are out of this world very David lynch as well as the opening sequence. I don't want to give away plot details for the film. But for those that are in to the indie art cinema this one is for you. The nude sequences are shot beautifully and tastefully. The film is pretty much a silent film with very little dialogue with little explanation. But the movie itself for the most part is pretty self explanatory for someone that is use to these types of films. I will be purchasing this film on bluray with no hesitation. This and Matchpoint , Vickie Christina Barcelona would probably be scarlet's three best films. But this one hands down is her most experimental and challenging role. If you like this film check out Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr, Lost river, Inland Empire, Excision and AntiChrist you won't be disappointed.",1401667200,32,1604,4.559027777777778

It supports the cryptic plot and dark ambience, where Scarjo forms the first link in the chain that abducts men (and only men) for purposes unknown. The mood develops throughout the film, as Scarjo's character seems to crumble from within.

But, in the end, it's only mood, with barely a plot to point to and more left unresolved than not.

6315035,5,B00J22YU62,"""Under the Skin"" is a movie that recalls the Kubrick of 2001--not least because (with respect to dialogue) it could be a silent film. If you can't decipher the Scots dialect (it's set in Scotland) you're not missing anything important. This is a movie of ideas and emotions, rather than clockwork plots, and it cannot be reduced to a statement. It also resembles 2001 in its voiceless surrealism, and in the beauty of its images.

Scarlett Johannson was the perfect choice for the film's unnamed protagonist, and her face is the luminous and opaque center of the movie. The performance itself is almost the portrayal of absence, maintained steadily through the movie. Yet though Johannson's emotional flatness is constant, her behavior changes in the course of events, and her character develops, bringing the viewer into a kind of identification with her. This is a movie you'll talk about later.",1398643200,13,897,5.02013422818792
6315036,5,B00J22YU62,"The style of Stanley Kubrick is evident here. If you are watching this movie for Scar Jo's boobs and nothing else, I cannot recommend it. If you are a film lover and love experimental and films with a lack of dialogue then this movie is made for you. You will most likely love it. It speaks to what it means to be truly human.",1398556800,14,326,4.109375
6315037,1,B00J22YU62,"This movie sums up much of what people hate about indie films, it tries way too hard to be artistic and fails completely.  Shots are held way too long, there is no exposition about why anyone is doing what they do is never explained and the movie is a complete mess.  My wife has read the synopsis of the book this was adapted from and it sounds like the makers of this film hatcheted the book to the point of incomprehensibility.

I am sure there are those who will say I'm not smart enough to understand the genius of this movie so I will say where I am coming from.  I hate Hollywood cookie cutter movies that I feel I have seen 10 times before just by seeing the trailer for them so I pretty much avoid big budget movies these days.  Many indie films go too far the other way though such as this one.  For the record, I like most of what Aronofsky has done like Pi and Nolan was good before he was allowed too big a budget so I don't demand big budgets or even color, just something well made.",1398038400,16,997,4.11340206185567

6315039,5,B00J22YU62,"As I sit here writing this review Im trying to think about which films Under the Skin reminds me of and to be perfectly honest I cant think of any one in particular.  If youve seen any of the 1950s science fiction films such as Devil Girl from Mars (1955) or The Astounding She-Monster (1957) its a cross between these pictures and something out of the Shyamalan camp.  The latter I say because of the way the film ended.  Having read nothing about the plot prior to the screening I was confused early on about the presence of the motor cycle rider in addition to Scarlets character.  It was about s of the way through that I finally realized the two were both alien, but not the same character.  There was very little dialogue and a tremendous amount of subtext and imagery embedded within. I am reminded of the scene in the van with Scarlett and the disfigured man. Though extraterrestrial and from a faraway distant planet she is able to demonstrate a basic set feelings and emotions similar to the way humans do. After the encounter with him she feels shame. I think her death at the films end symbolizes a realization of the power of the mind over lust and physical desire. Mentally she was so distraught by what shed done that there was no future anywhere in the universe fit for her. A gorgeous picture.(3.5/4 Stars).",1397865600,12,1324,4.523012552301255
6315040,4,B00J22YU62,"""Under The Skin"" (2013 release from Scotland; 108 min.) brings the story of several aliens (one man, one woman) whom we see take the shape on a human. The woman, played by Scarlett Johansson, starts picking up one guy after another, leading them to her house where she ""takes care of business"" (how? I'm not going to spoil). Eventually the woman tries to fit better in and even tries getting into a 'real' relationship. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is the latest movie from British director Jonathan Glazer, best know for bringing us ""Sexy Beast"" some years ago. His previous movie ""Birth"" was also a take on things that are not quite your normal situation, but here he goes one better, and then some. Second, the science fiction tone of the movie is brought expertly, from the opening scenes where we're not sure what exactly is happening, it looks to be something in space like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Third, there are a number of stunning, if at times unsettling, scenes, including the extended beach scene, and the scene with the 26 yr. old virgin guy. Fourth, the movie is set in Scotland, and while we get glimpses of some of its beauty, the overall feeling is pretty grey and grim, and hence not necessarily an inviting ""postcard from Scotland"" (in contrast to that other seminal Scottish film from 30 years ago, ""Local Hero""). Fifth, there is a very abstract soundtrack that matches the movie perfectly, scored by British artist Mica Levi (a/k/a Micachu). Last but certainly not least, what can you say about the performance from Scarlett Johansson. Yes, there is nudity, and quite a bit of it, but far more important is the astonishing way in which she portrays the alien. By coincidence, she is currently in the theatres also with another science-fiction movie, albeit one of a very different kind, namely ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", which I have no interest in seeing. I'm sure she collected a big check for that movie, and if that is what allows her to take on more challenging indie roles such as this movie and ""Don Jon"", then I'm all for it. I guess I wasn't quite sure what to expect from ""Under The Skin"", but I can tell you that was I saw far surpassed whatever expectations I had, including an unforgettable ending.

""Under The Skin"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The matinee showing I saw this at was not particularly well attended, but that could just as much be a reflection of the very nice weather outside. Either way, if you are in the mood for the antithesis of that other current science fiction movie starring Johansson, you cannot go wrong with ""Under The Skin"". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1397779200,8,2816,4.686868686868687

6315042,2,B00J22YU62,"The only saving grace to this movie is that you get to see Scarlett J. naked.

Brief synopsis of the movie:  SJ is hunting men who won't be missed (no family, friends) and feeds them to a house.  There is a guy (or a few) who act as backup for her should she end up in trouble (or dead, the first scene in the movie where you actually see people is this guy riding up on a motorcycle, walks into the darkness and comes back carrying a dead SJ, then another being (who is SJ) strips her down of her clothes and puts them on).  At one point she stops hunting guys and lives with a guy who ""only wants to help her"", but he ""becomes"" enamored with her.  She apparently forgets she is different and rediscovers it when she tries to have sex with him.  She then runs away and gets in to serious trouble that the backup (who is looking for her since she ""ran-away"") can't help her with.  Then the movie ends.

We have no idea what the house is, what SJ really is (apart from alien) or why the guys on motorcycles are helping her.

Too make matters worse (if that is really possible), the film uses actors from Europe whose accents are fairly thick.  So what there is of dialog (not a lot, I'd say about 85% of the movie is silent except for the background noise of cars and the almost ear splitting music) is hard to understand.  I only picked up about every 3rd word that someone other than SJ was saying.

Like I said, the only good parts are when SJ is naked (3 scenes, though one scene is only topless) and I could have done without seeing the guys she lead to the house naked.",1397692800,11,1574,4.141447368421052
6315043,5,B00J22YU62,"Leaving the theater, I was sure I had just seen one of the best movies to come out in recent years. I'm still not sure exactly how to describe it or even put it into words, but it was one of the most surreal experiences I've had while watching a movie. Scarlett does a fantastic job at being both charming enough to lure her victims into her trap, cold enough to not care that she's leading these men to their deaths, and then, at the turning point in the movie, vulnerable enough to make the audience believe she is emotionally conflicted about what makes someone human.

Definitely not going to be a movie for everyone, but I would recommend a watch regardless.",1397606400,22,663,4.434426229508197

What you get is much bad weather, much rough scenery, a beautiful woman hunting men and mysteriously disposing of them, some guys on motor bikes who seem to be the clean up crew ... To quote Monty Python: what does it mean?
The woman experiences some kind of mind change, she seems to run away. From what?
That's when some of the most romantic scenes happen. See for yourself.
Some people were bored and left. I couldn't do that, the imagery was too compelling, and I kept up the hope to understand it, maybe. Maybe somebody does. It certainly doesn't quite fit our normal movie viewing experience.",1397260800,15,864,4.474683544303797

No moment, no scenic view, no character interaction goes un-lingered, so the whole movie sort of oozes along in almost continuous dramatic stretch, in a seeming attempt to impregnate each scene with meaning that isn't there.  It trades in the currency of the pseudo-intellectual:  obfuscation in lieu of depth.  Its very essence is what we don't actually see: beatniks with bongos chanting meaningless poetry to an audience (or a director) too cool to admit they don'tcant!--have a clue what any of it means. It might have a saving grace in Scarlet Johansson, but only if you've ever wanted to see her Playboy-centerfold naked.
