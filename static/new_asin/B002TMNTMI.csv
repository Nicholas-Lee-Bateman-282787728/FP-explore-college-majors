8380285,4,B002TMNTMI,"This is a review of the DVD, by AGI, on the ""Disassembly & Reassembly of Colt's Double Action Revolvers"".  My objective, when I purchased this DVD, was to learn how to completely Disassemble and Reassemble my Colt double action Revolvers.

My initial research led me to the purchase of 2 Manuals, with stellar reviews, by Jerry Kuhnhausen, on Colt's double action Revolvers.  I quickly realized that these were serious manuals geared towards professional, or advanced amateur gunsmiths.  Could a non professional Revolver enthusiast performed a Disassembly & Reassembly with these manuals?  Probably yes, but I still didn't have enough confidence to start Disassembling.

There was also a DVD by Jerry Kuhnhausen, on the same subject, with no reviews, that I purchased. Again, geared towards the professional, or advanced amateur gunsmith, this DVD does not show actual disassembly shots. The narrator just talks about removing such and such a part, and the next cut shows the parts removed, without showing how it was done. The DVD shows potential trouble spots to look for when doing a disassembly, and how to perform needed repairs, etc.

More research finally pointed me to AGI's DVD ""Disassembly/Reassembly, of the Colt double action Revolver"". Again, no reviews, but bought it anyway.  This DVD clearly shows how to take a Colt double action Revolver totally apart, and put it back together again!

The AGI DVD is not a slick production, with great lighting, etc., but it is a step above the one person YouTube demos. This one  looks to be a two person production, the narrator and a cameraman, but it is a complete demonstration, with step by step visuals, and lots of close-up views of the Disassembly and then the Reassembly of a Colt double action Revolver. They used a well worn, blued, Colt Python for the demonstration.

There's not much more to add about this DVD, other than to repeat, that it is a simple, but complete demonstration, of the Disassemble and Reassemble of  a Colt double action Revolver, that a novice amateur gunsmith (like myself), can follow, with some confidence!",1379289600,2,2098,5.031791907514451
