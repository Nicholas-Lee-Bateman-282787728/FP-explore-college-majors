She was defintely ahead of her time, but she had a hell of a lot of courage. I admire her a lot. Watch this movie. You will never view race relations the same again.

863559,5,6304331908,This is when I figured out that HALLE is a really really great actress. This movie is so good! The cast and story is great as well. No flaws in my opinion.,1126742400,3,155,3.875
863560,5,6304331908,I really enjoyed this movie. I think that Halle was superb as well as the entire cast. I was shocked and appalled when she didn't get recognized for this movie but received an Oscar for a movie of less depth. This movie is a heartfelt story of a bi-racial slave who trying to find her place in the world. Alex Haley is a brillant storyteller and this movie is a perfect adaptation of that.,1106438400,5,389,4.27027027027027
863561,5,6304331908,THIS IS HALLE AT HER VERY BEST. I LOVE THIS MOVIE HALLE WAS SO WONDERFUL IN THIS MOVIE SHE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AN OSCAR FOR THIS MINI-SERIES BECAUSE SHE DID A VERY FINE JOB I LIKE THIS MOVIE. THIS IS CLASSIC HALLE WHEN SHE WAS REALLY GOOD!!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO LIKES HALLE BECAUSE SHE DEFINITELY DID A TERIFFIC ACTING JOB IN THIS MOVIE.....,1095724800,9,364,4.367647058823529
863562,5,6304331908,"Absolutely spectacular and highly recommend! It's a classic epic right up there with North and South and Roots.  It also introduces the audience to a new viewpoint...which is the thousands and thousands of ""children of the plantation"".... slaves of mixed race who were forced to endure hardships and even more prejudice than other freed slaves because often other blacks would not accept them because of their white ancestry.  Halle Berry demonstrates a wide range of emotions and in my opinion was the best performance of her career thus far.",1093996800,5,543,5.089887640449438
863563,5,6304331908,"I loved this movie. Their is still this prejudice against bi-racial people and I can relate.  What happened in Queen is what happens now still.  Its hard to get accepted.  This movie did a good job in showing a bi-racials point of view in the movie Queen.  Halle Berry(my fave actress) did an EXCELLENT job in this movie and I was also impressed with the scenery and costumes.  It was so real and I think it was an great idea to have an continuing of roots.  I would really recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies or tv shows like Dr. Quinn, or historical movies.  You don't want to take your eyes off the screen because you want to know what happenes next.",977875200,11,665,4.314516129032258
863564,2,6304331908,"I have read the book ''Queen'' by Alex Haley. I thought it was an  absoloutley touching book. I rented the movie recently, and after watching  three parts I have to say I did think it was partially good, but something  was missing. That something was the brutality. I understand that at the  ''Forks of Cypress'' slaves were treated well, unfortunately in the book  there was enough brutality (beating, whippings, rapes) to give the reader  enough understanding of WHY the slaves wanted freedom. In this movie as the  slaves are treated with such respect and given no beatings, fine clothes,  little work and much respect, what exactly would make freedom so appealing?  I understand to be a slave is a horrible thing, but I feel the movie did  not do a good enough job of depicting at least some of the evilness of  slavery. As for the actors: some were great. I think that the characters of  Alice, Cap'n Jack, Sally, Lizzie(part of the time), and Easter were  extremely well cast. In this movie however, a lot of core relationships are  glossed over. In the book Lizzie hated Queen. Queen was the living  embodiment of Easter, and she hated the fact that James loved Easter more  than her. In this movie she is quite kind to Queen, and even Easter, who  she treats with much respect. As for Queen, she is not at all cruel, at  times kind, and sometimes, really, much like a step-mother. It's only in  one of the last scenes of ''Part 1'' of the movie that Lizzie shows the  anger she SHOULD have shown the whole time. Patricia Clarkson who plays  Lizzie is a good actress, the character should have been written correctly  the whole time. As for the main character Queen, well part of the time as  happy Queen, innocent Queen, sweet Queen, Halle Berry did well.  Unfortunately Queen was also required to be angry, sorrow, hurt, and cry a  lot. Halle Berry didn't do very well in that. As for the breakdown, she has  her scenes, but overall she's not that good. James is played moderately  well, but again the character is drained of the brutality he had (his power  over Lizzie), and is nothing great. All in all I'd reccomend seeing this  movie, but only after you've read the book to get the whole story.",965692800,13,2208,4.57544757033248
863565,5,6304331908,"I THINK THIS MOVIE GIVES AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THE TIMES. I THINK THE WHOLE SLAVERY ISSUE IS NOT BEING LOOKED AT REALISTICALLY. IT IS NOT A BLACK & WHITE ISSUE, BUT A PEOPLE ISSUE. IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT A MAN  CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, REGARDLESS OF HER ETHNIC  BACKGROUND. A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THOMAS JEFFERSON AND SALLY HEMINGS. QUEENS  FATHER WAS THE SON OF A SLAVE OWNER, AND WENT ALONG WITH THE VIEWS OF THE  TIME ONLY ON THE SURFACE. IT WAS NECESSARY AT THE TIME TO APPEAR TO SHARE  THE COMMON VIEWS TO AVOID THE TROUBLE THAT CAME ALONG WITH GOING AGAINST  THE NORM, HOWEVER,THAT DID NOT NEGATE HIS FEELINGS FOR EASTER. YOU REALLY  HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMES TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE. NEVERTHELESS, I THINK  IT DEFINATELY DESERVES A VIEW, I THINK THIS PROBABLY  MS. BERRY'S FINEST  PERFORMANCE. SHE GAVE ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,  THAT I'VE EVER SEEN, AND LORD KNOWS SHE HAD GOOD REASON TO HAVE ONE IN THE  MOVIE. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!",950832000,12,995,4.466666666666667

7870206,5,6304331908,"After seeing Roots, I needed to learn more about Alex Haley's family.  Queen was well played by Halle Berry.  This beautiful woman was transformed into a sad, unhappy slave.  The story was beautifully told by beautiful actors.",1389744000,,226,5.054054054054054

7870208,5,6304331908,Good movie from icon Alex Haley.  Halle Berry does a fantastic job acting in this film.  A nice addition to your collection.,1356134400,,124,4.590909090909091
7870209,3,6304331908,"Set in the old South, the story of Queen is a sad, but poignant one. The prejudice against her and the confusion and fear she endures because of her mixed heritage sheds light on the suffering of the times. The acting was great. I think this was one of the first leads for Halle Berry and she does a marvelous job. The only problem I had was her makeup. It's like they were trying to make her look lighter than what she was and her skin color would come out chalkie sometimes. Also, there was no way to confuse her with being white (because of her coloring and features), even when she was young (played by Raven-Symone), yet there was references to her being almost white as a sheet or something like that. Queen couldn't find help from white or black. Being of mixed heritage myself, it's hard enough these days, but during slavery times it was dangerous. But in the end, Queen finds a place for herself in this world with a man who loves her. It was a riveting story!",1214956800,,970,4.335164835164835
7870210,5,6304331908,"I have Queen, the 1993 mini series, made from the book Alex Hailey wrote.

It seems that movies like this were stopped since all these cable channels came on. These new channels, being remarkable in entertainment as they are, are very far behind in those made for TV movies or the mini series that were on the regular networks. This is my own opinion, of course, but that's the way it seems to me. Also, when these mini series came out in video or dvd, they were cut. Some great movies and mini series were cut so much, as to edit out the reasons for things and why the movie was made in the first place, at times. This movie, Queen, was a movie like this. Edited so very little, but edited it was. I pride myself in the mini series and movies I have that aren't cut because they came straight from TV. There was remarkable acting in this film, with Halle Berry at her best. Her oscar win was a long awaited one for her. And Alex Hailey was a man who touched our hearts with his wonderfully written books that were made into screenplays. He was a master at his craft as HB was of hers and also the other wonderful cast members in this wonderfully made film. See it if you haven't.",1140134400,11,1180,4.221238938053097
