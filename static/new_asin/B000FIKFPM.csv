8123455,5,B000FIKFPM,"I received a DVD THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WILLE NELSON THE RED HEADED STRANGER.  IT'S
A VERY ENTERTAINING DVD - BUT NOT THE MOVIE THAT Honest Abe, the first reviewer
describes.  I""m afraid that I will never get a DVD of one of my favorite movies,
The Red Headed Stranger.  This is the 2nd time I ordered RED HEADED STRANGER only
to get the wrong version.  The first time was not from Amazon.",1272326400,15,388,4.202702702702703
8123456,1,B000FIKFPM,"This DVD is ""Region 2"" format, meaning it is made for Europe and unlikely to play on US players.  There was no warning of this until I opened the package.

The label made it clear that removing the Region 2 warning and opening the jewel case would make it unacceptable for returning, so I am not sure whether or not the ""Red Headed Stranger"" movie is on the disc.  However, the part of the package that I can see makes it seem very unlikely that it contains the movie.  I bought this item because it is sometimes described as the Red Headed Strnager movie.  But, it is also sometimes described as ""The Life And Times Of Willie Nelson"".  Be careful!

By the way, the movie is great if you enjoy Willie!",1166659200,8,701,4.305343511450381
8123457,5,B000FIKFPM,"I caught this western on Hallmark chanel and was very pleased with it (Except for all of the commercials) I hope to see it offered on DVD for a more reasonable price. Lots of action, and an interesting plot. A minister who goes bad over love gone wrong. Shows great contrast with the human condition good/evil - Love and hate. As well as good vs evil.",1159142400,5,351,4.333333333333333
