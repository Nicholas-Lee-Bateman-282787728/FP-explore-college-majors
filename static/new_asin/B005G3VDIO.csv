This little elf can get into so much around the house!
Children can not wait to see what he gets into next!",1355961600,,165,3.9696969696969697
4687175,5,B005G3VDIO,It is a very cute movie. It tells a story of the elf on the shelf. It helped my daughter understand the tradition behind it.,1355011200,,124,4.0

4687177,2,B005G3VDIO,"Our kids love this movie, so what better than to have it on Blu-Ray and 3-D?  The disc that was shipped was a DVD, not a Blu-Ray.  Amazon was great with helping to return the item, but did not have the blu-ray version to send.  Correspondence with the seller was not good.. they just referred me to Amazon.",1337817600,2,306,4.241379310344827
4687178,1,B005G3VDIO,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

OOS EFFECTS:
There are about 14 out of screen effects that extend between 10 and 15% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. An additional 5 effects made it to 25%.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
Huge separation between right and left views results in ghosting and double images throughout this short film. To be fair I would like to hear from a passive user, so...

IF YOU HAVE PASSIVE AND THIS MOVIE, PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT !!!

This is a cute, kids, Christmas short, just avoid watching it in 3D.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
Don't even think about it. This film is a headache inducing eyesore.
(crosstalk varies from system to system) but the 3D on this one wins a booby prize

MY 3D RATING = POOR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4687179,4,B005G3VDIO,This movie is cute for children who still believe in Santa Claus.  This movie backs up the premis of the Elf on a Shelf and the clever way to get kids to believe.,1324339200,,162,3.909090909090909

4687184,4,B005G3VDIO,"This is a product review of the 3D bluray version of this movie. Not about the movie itself (which is already reviewed by many customers here anyway).

The box contains 2 discs: a 3D bluray and a DVD version of the movie.

Pros:
Excellent 3D. Spectacular throughout! The 3D depth is very good. The animation is superb and very pleasing to watch. Excellent colour and contrast.

Cons:
Ghosting was found in some of the scenes. But that did not have any distracting effect on the overall viewing experience.
Since the 3D was so good and engrossing, I wished it lasted for at least an hour. Unfortunately, it was only about 24 mins of content (!) Felt rather too short.

Overall, a great 3D (short) movie - one of the best and pleasing 3D animations.",1475193600,,747,4.552238805970149

4687196,5,B005G3VDIO,"Gave this to my nephew to see how he felt about the elf on the shelf, because I know some kids are scared of the idea of an elf in the house.

He absolutely loves this movie and my sister says an elf will be sent to her house from Santa this year.

I have watched this with my 2 year old as well, however we already did the elf on the shelf prior to seeing this movie. And it is just too cute and not too long either. Not a Christmas classic but a great way to have an ""elf ice breaker"" if you are unsure how your child will feel about the idea.",1441670400,,545,3.7304347826086954

I thought it didn't work and he thought it didn't because it was Blue Ray. We didn't notice the other DVD.

4687233,5,B005G3VDIO,"Very nice film for the children.  The 3D antics are very good.  The story line is nice, however it may be a bit
suggestive of ""no Santa"" to children who still believe in the magic of Christmas.  I watched it before the
kids and was able to thwart the innuendo about Santa.",1402012800,3,272,4.1923076923076925

She had a blast watching this movie, so much that she still asks to watch it daily. At 30 minutes long it is just the right length for a toddler's attention span.

As a family we've watched it 3 or 4 times, and find it entertaining every time.",1357603200,,391,3.949367088607595
