3083754,3,B00128960O,"Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal is s movie that is purely based on soccer and stars John Abraham, Bipasha Basu, Boman Irani and Dalip Tahil, Arshad Wasi, directed by Vivek Agnihotri and is written by Anurag Kashyap.

This is a very well researched made movie, in terms of research as well and what has made it better is that it was almost entirely filmed at London's Chelsea Football club, one of the current top teams in this country. The grounds used were those of the club. Howeve, in one scene, Manchester United Football Club can be seen and one scene is filmed inside the ""museum"" area where there are names, etc, of the players who were killed in the Munich air crash. The film makers were reported to have received a lot of help from Chelsea Football club and there were reports that some of the Chelsea players even kicked the ball around with some of the cast. But this movie has also shown reality and what some foreign players come across on the pitch - racism. Only recently, some players did complain that racism does exist stands where fans call some of them ""names."" But there are procedures that enable this to be stopped whenever possible. Also, what was correctly shown is that Indians, Pakistanis and even Bangladeshi people, born in this country do support various teams. The songs are not bad at all considering that there are not many.

Since this movie has drama, tragedy and romance, it is a good movie and more so if you enjoy watching soccer.",1304467200,,1458,4.582375478927203
3083755,4,B00128960O,"This is about a UK born Indian guy (John Abraham) who is very good at soccer but isn't fully accepted in white teams for racist reasons (probably unfair to the English who do seem to have foreign faces on their sports teams). Then there is the struggling all Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi team who will lose their playing ground if they don't win the season - even though they lose all their matches. They don't like the John's character but can they accept him and knit as a team to win as required...and will the dirty tricks of developers who want the ground succeed etc
This plot is hardly unpredictable but then who makes sports movies about the team that fails and the guy who gives up and goes home to grow roses for the rest of his life!! But the cliche really is the fun of these movies (and I am not a sports fan). Really these movies are about the human dilemmas and challenges of the people involved and this one has the slant of Indians (NRIs) in the UK (and all the movie is set in the UK)
It was rather lacklustre early in the movie and a bit slow but as it warmed up it settled into quite a charming and engaging movie.
The acting was good. John Abraham is no longer the stiff actor of his earlier movies, and did a good job with the part. His girlfriend, and team doctor, is played by real-life girlfriend Bipasha Basu (who originally wanted to be a doctor herself!). They have great chemistry together, were relaxed and really sparked - unlike some other real couples who often seem awkward together on film. Arshad Warsi was also very good as team captain, as was Boman Irani as coach back from self-exiled retirement.
There is also some good music - mostly background music but with one big crowd-pleasing item number.
We ended up quite liking this one. I do see elsewhere on the Net that its usually seen as just average -and IMDb ratings suggest women like it a bit more than men overall - odd for a sports movie. It may be because it has good interplay between characters and heart - and John Abraham has a certain attractiveness of course. Or perhaps men like their sports movies more hard hitting?
If you liked 'Victory: from Ashes to Glory' or even 'Chak de India' you may want to try this one.",1242518400,,2219,4.427872860635697
3083756,3,B00128960O,"In the wake of the uber-successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chak-De-India/dp/B000WOQKL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chak De India</a>, which told the underdog story of women athletes in field hockey, Bollywood was quick to come up with DHAN DHANA DHAN GOAL. This time, the focus is on soccer (or football, as it's known everywhere other than the States). Except that when compared to CHAK DE INDIA, DHAN DHANA DHAN GOAL pales noticeably. And, even judged solely on its own merits, this film labors under a busload of bad cinematic decisions.

Just keep track of the cliches now.

For England's Southall United Football Club, things couldn't be at a lower ebb. Universally regarded as the armpit team of the Combined Counties Football League, Southall hasn't had a winning season in a hell of a while. The team being comprised of blue-collar players of South Asian descent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), racial baiting and discrimination surface with regularity (although, to be fair, there's also a fair amount of Brit bashing). What's more, the City Council is determined to tear down the Southall stadium and erect a shopping mall in its place. The only way out for Southall is to compete in the league tournament and win the championship (and the prize money, to pay off the lease, which hadn't been paid in the past eight years). The obstacles are daunting. No uniforms, no gear, no sponsorship, no coach, no support from the community, and the stadium stands are desolate. Most importantly, the team is hapless at the sport. My old granny with the two hip replacements could play a better brand of football.

The three central characters are strong selling points for the film. Arshad Warsi plays Shaan, the earnest team captain who determines to save the future of Southall United. He starts by recruiting disgraced and broken-down ex-player Tony Singh (Boman Irani) to be the team coach. Buff good-looker John Abraham plays Sunny Bhasin, a gifted but arrogant Pakistani striker who happens to look down at his own culture. When his dream of playing for an English football team is ignominiously shot down, he ends up signing on with the league's laughing stock. Team cohesiveness disintegrates even further when Sunny signs on, as he and Shaan simply cannot stand each other.

Really, there's absolutely nothing new here, but that's not the knock against this movie. Sports cinema wrings out cliches more often than Shahrukh Khan weeps in his roles. Thing is, the film is riddled with too much overwrought melodrama, and, at 2 hours 44 minutes, that's a whole lot of hand-wringing. It should really have taken a page from CHAK DE INDIA, which was exciting and dramatic in spots but overall maintained a low-key and grounded tone. Everything in DHAN DHANA DHAN GOAL is over-the-top, to the point that believability was shoved out the window fairly early on. I think it started going downhill for me, minutes into the movie, when the owner of the Southall United Football Club gets the bad news and then proceeds to abruptly die in the car (of grief, undoubtedly). Another intended high point but which ends up being laughable is the big inspirational speech the coach makes in the Manchester United team locker room. This moment is supposed to mark the turning point for the lowly team, except that, as performed by a momentarily ineffective Boman Irani, I don't see how it can. The disappointing thing is that, in his other scenes, Boman is his typically reliable self.

The action on the football field is decent, although some of the actors on the Southall side don't look very fit and convincing as athletes. The film's eventful final 20 minutes are devoted to the championship game and makes up a bit for the film's lapses.

Interestingly, Bipasha Basu plays an unusually forward girl (by Bollywood standards). She's the one who actually hits on the guy. I must've been getting caught up into Bollywood's traditional and cultural sensibilities, because I actually had to adjust to that. Bipasha routinely takes on vapid, sexy roles, so it's nice to see her play a fledgling sports physician here, and with glasses.

Solely based on my viewing experience, Bollywood has had a good track record with its sports-oriented flicks. I loved CHAK DE INDIA, as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iqbal/dp/B000I0RVI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iqbal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lagaan-Once-Upon-a-Time-in-India/dp/B00005U124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in India</a>.

By the way, since this is a Bollywood product, there are musical numbers here. But, appropriate to the dramatic tones, there aren't as many as in your typical Bollywood film. Still, it's worth noting that, even burdened with a crutch, a proper dude in Bollywood must get down and balle balle whenever the song is cued.
