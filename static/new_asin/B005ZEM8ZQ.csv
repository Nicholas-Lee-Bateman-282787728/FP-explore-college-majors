She is a real estate agent that appears maybe 10 minutes at all in the whole film..... ha ha ha ..... She is as lovely as always but barely appears on the film. Not a great movie...",1350172800,,354,4.378787878787879
4908565,1,B005ZEM8ZQ,"Don't let the good reviews steer you into buying this movie. The bad acting, the bad plot and script and pretty much everything about this movie left us feeling like we wasted our time watching it.  And we generally like most movies.  I hope I can get a dollar for it at our garage sale.",1347408000,,287,4.2
4908566,4,B005ZEM8ZQ,"This wasn't a bad little movie. If you liked the idea of the movie ""Fight Club"" you will like this movie.",1343865600,,105,4.0476190476190474
4908567,5,B005ZEM8ZQ,"I watched this movie after seeing a preview on another DVD. This one was great. Oz Perkins proves he can be just as spooky as his father, Anthony Perkins. He plays his role with the perfect mixture of pompous and creepiness. Billy Burke steps away from his Twilight role of Officer Swan and into a role that is very eerie. This is a thinking persons movie and not is at all what you think!",1337990400,7,389,4.27027027027027
4908568,5,B005ZEM8ZQ,"Removal is a great movie from start to finish. The cast was excellent and the storyline was spot on. It was original, entertaining and creepy! Billy Burke and Oz Perkins were fantastic in this movie.",1337472000,6,199,4.714285714285714
4908569,4,B005ZEM8ZQ,"The movie starts out with a man on prescription meds getting laid off from work. The next day he is involved in an awkward murder/suicide witnessed by Cole. We then cue credits. Cole (Mark Kelly) is now on prescription meds to prevent hallucinations. He works for a floor cleaning outfit and his condition has alienated him from his family.

After working a week of doubles a tired worn out Cole is offered a job to clean a rich man's floors for an additional $5,000 under the table. Thinking of his wife and child, Cole reluctantly takes the job, cleaning floors to a decent soundtrack while having flashbacks to times with his family...and the murder/suicide.

Oz Perkins plays Henry Sharpe, the odd man whose house Cole cleans. There are hints that Henry has murdered his family...the flashbacks get more intense as the film progresses. Enjoyable film.

Good psycho-thriller. Solid 4 stars.

F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1325894400,7,920,4.916129032258064
4908570,5,B005ZEM8ZQ,I was lucky enough to see this at AFI Fest when it premiered and enjoyed it quite a bit!  Glad to see a great independent thriller like this one getting distribution!,1325548800,7,166,4.354838709677419

8489576,4,B005ZEM8ZQ,"Osgood Perkins gives a good performance. After witnessing a friend's gruesome suicide, things haven't been the same for Cole. He is being tormented by what appear to be hallucinations. After working several double shifts, Cole thought things couldn't get any worse - until he's called out to an all-night carpet cleaning job for a man named Henry, who leads him to believe he has just killed his wife. As he hurries to clean the place, Cole's hallucinations start to interfere, and the horrid truth that unfolds will leave you begging for it to stop! Plot is somewhat confusing. It met of been better with a different ending.",1463875200,,625,4.850467289719626
8489577,1,B005ZEM8ZQ,"""Removal"" was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Uninteresting characters, terrible acting, and the god-awful music made me wish I were deaf.",1445558400,,148,5.208333333333333

8489581,2,B005ZEM8ZQ,"the movie wasn't as good as I expected, It never really got going, it would start to pick up steam and then just stall out and leave you hanging...",1401148800,,147,4.103448275862069
8489582,3,B005ZEM8ZQ,I thought Billy Burke played his role very well I was much disappointed with the wealthy  mansion owner his role was rather over exaggerated and a bit cartoonish... It had moments where it was very interesting and then moments where flashbacks started to make it somewhat confusing. I think this movie would've been better in a theater setting where you would be completely focused on the film and not distracted by anything else. if you miss 30 seconds of it it might leave you wondering where you're at... Some of the acting was excellent the premise was nice but overall not completely enthralled...,1390780800,,602,4.844660194174757
8489583,5,B005ZEM8ZQ,In order not to give away anything...let me just say what a mind trip I'm really glad to see Billy Burke in another role,1380844800,,120,4.041666666666667
8489584,5,B005ZEM8ZQ,"Co-Stars Mark Kelly and Billy Burke are wonderful in this thriller.  It has all the great qualities of a ""Hitchcock"" mind bender.  A must see!",1358553600,,142,4.64
