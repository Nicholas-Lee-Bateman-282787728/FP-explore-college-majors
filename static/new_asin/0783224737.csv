7790100,3,0783224737,"another hard film to find,is on a ntsc vhs tape in the states or dvd-r copies from private collectors,but don`t try too much to get it as poster is promising more than film delivers,just seen this last night and should have been  much better,anything with Sidney Poitier in it is worth a look,but this is very slow and way too talkie,feels like an episode of ironside or any cop series from the sixties,idea of blacks knocking off a local companies payrol sounds good,but the bits inbetween way the movie down and ending takes a little to believe,may get a proper release but will not be high on any dvd firms releasing schedule,or your wish list.",1316649600,,647,4.626086956521739
7790101,5,0783224737,"This is a good movie about explosive late 60s race relations. But the soundtrack is not listed on Amazon. So I will use the movie entry to review the soundtack.

Quincy Jones, one of the absolute best film composers of this time, wrote the Lost Man Soundtrack, and it is excellent. It holds a lot of soul and blues by unknown singers, and lots of electrified flutes and heavy fuzz bass. It is typlically outstanding work by Jones, who understood jazz and blues better than any composer of the period. He also understood how to exploit tone color to get the maximum tension from the film.

The music, however, holds up beautifully on its own, and I would encourage
anyone to seek out this soundtrack on vynal, until someone has the good sense to reissue The Lost Man score.",1214438400,3,772,4.546762589928058
7790102,5,0783224737,"THIS MOVIE IS THE FIRST TRUE BLAXPLOITATION FILM, LONG BEFORE THERE WAS A SWEETBACK, SHAFT, OR SUPERFLY. SIDNEY POITIER'S PERFORMANCE, AS ALWAYS, STANDS OUT. AT THE TIME THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED (1969), THE  CRITICS AND THE PUBLIC CRITICIZED MR. POITIER FOR BEING THE PERFECT NEGRO  IN HIS PREVIOUS FILMS (IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, GUESS WHO COMING TO DINNER, THE SLENDER THREAD, DUEL AT DIABLO,ETC). HOWEVER, IN THE LOST MAN, MR. POITIER PORTRAYS A 1960'S REVOLUTIONARY WHO MASTERMINDS A DARING  ROBBERY THAT GOES WRONG AND PLACES HIM ON THE RUN FROM THE POLICE. A FINE SUPPORTING CAST WITH A EDGE OF THE SEAT, NAIL-BITING CLIMAX THAT WILL LEAVE  YOU BREATHLESS.FOR A FILM THAT IS CLOSE TO 40 YEARS OLD, THE MOVIE STILL HOLDS UP VERY WELL AND IS ANOTHER PIECE OF THE POWERFUL BODY OF FILM WORK OF SIDNEY POITIER.",947721600,28,823,4.774647887323944
