In my opinion, this video is very incomplete (okay, lame). It only gives snipits of David's concepts and work. His seminars usually last an entire weekend or longer and this video only captures moments. To me, it plays like an expanded promotional video or trailer for his seminars or published works.

I would NOT suggest this video to anyone hoping to get more from David's work. His books are much more helpful and thorough. I was left feeling VERY dissappointed at the end of the video especially knowing I had spent $30 for it.

As far as service, I was very pleased. I received video within 3 days. Tommy",1308355200,6,873,4.44375
8098556,5,B000CEX3JE,"David Deida is provocative and rightly so.  He honestly describes ways one can take spirituality and sexuality to a deeper place, if one chooses.  This video was very insightful and gives a good basis for his work, although reading a book like Finding God Through Sex may be a suitable pre-requisite.  If you're ready to move through desire and fear in sexuality this video may assist.  We definitely enjoyed it.",1298160000,2,412,4.8428571428571425
