8239729,3,B00110XTH4,"On the 1st day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...ROH Motor City Madness 2006. The Delirious-Zach Gowen match was a nice energetic opener. The Allison Danger & Lacey vs. Daizee Haze & MsChif-tag team match was ugly this side of Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon. The Claudio Castagnoli-Davey Richards match was a pretty good bout. The Christopher Daniels & Matt Sydal-Colt Cabana & Jimmy Jacobs tag team match was decent at best. The Matt Sydal-Chris Hero match was also decent at best. The Jimmy Rave-Pelle Primeau-Dave Crist-Jake Crist-Shane Hagadorn-Matt Cross-6 way match was a very fun bout. The Bryan Danielson-Austin Aries-World Title match was pretty good,hard-hitting,heart-pounding bout. The Jay & Mark Briscoe-Homicide & Samoa Joe-World Tag Team title bout was pretty awesome brawl. I give this Super-Card a 6 out of 10.",1418515200,,835,5.2388059701492535
