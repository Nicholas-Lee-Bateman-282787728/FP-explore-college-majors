8666143,1,B00LIJ9VP2,"Jeffrey Smith; not a scientist (and zero scientific background) compiled this vid based on ""science?"" Nope. Turns out the vast majority of his higher education was spent at a yogi school where he learned to levatate (not joking.. just wiki/google the guys background.. there are pics online of him supposedly levitating)
This vid is full of poorly done studies (most of them rejected by highly regarded journals) and the few legit studies (Seralini, ect) have since been found to be complete frauds (wherein the labs used poor methadology to get more funding) and that makes this vid useless.
If you want actual science, look at the metadata.. turns out the vast majority (of both studies and scientists) show exactly the opposite of what this video does.
The biggest study documented in this vid is Seralini and his rats; what the study didn't show is that these rats get these huge tumors naturally anyways (lab mice are supposed to only be used for so long before euthanized, specifically because they grow tumors in late life)
Bottom line: if you want real science, don't buy or read stuff written/made by non-scientists. (especially  those who went to yogi school)
Jeffrey is a hoax/conspiracy theorist.. if you want to actually read science compiled by scientists, go quick look up Neil Degrasses' youtube video on GMOs, or Bill Nyes, or any other actual trained scientist... they will tell you this technology has been around 40 years, and is actually SAFER (because it's studied more) than conventional breeding :) Thanks, science!",1504915200,,1539,5.035294117647059
