7498051,5,B01793CMPQ,Awesome movie! Gave me a new outlook in my own life having suffered so much loss.,1527120000,,81,4.125
7498052,5,B01793CMPQ,"This film is a well done portrayal of a man who has lost everything in his life and is struggling with faith and meaning.  Sonny was a successful boxer who ends up killing a man in a boxing match.  After the incident, he loses everything and spirals into depression and alcohol abuse.  The story is something we can all relate to in one way or another, even if our life circumstances are not as severe.  I liked how there were other characters in the story that were also helped by Malachi, all having sad life events that they turned into a positive in one way or another.  The ending is really nice as well, and definitely surprised me.  This movie is just what someone who is struggling with life and faith needs to get them thinking and open their mind to the possibilities of God working in life.  I enjoyed it!",1526169600,,816,4.364238410596027
7498053,5,B01793CMPQ,"I liked the depth and application of spiritual principles in this movie. Will watch it again. So many idols in life that we place our trust in, and use to  get what we think we need and want. Movie makes a point about what really satisfies, a desire for God.",1523318400,,258,4.16
7498054,5,B01793CMPQ,Great movie!  God is always with us and wanting the best for us!!!  Praise be to the Father!!!,1523145600,,94,4.166666666666667
7498055,5,B01793CMPQ,"Incredibly inspiring movie! I love how my soul is filled with constant thanksgiving after watching this movie. I stopped it half-way and started keeping a journal like the champ. Soon my heart was lifted up, while tough circumstances continued. The ending where many things come together here on earth was not as important for me, but I know some will be blessed by it. I would've liked to have seen more of the heavenly glimpse that they gave us :-) Glad I did not stop watching this when it seemed to be moving so slow! Recommend to all!",1523145600,,539,4.510204081632653
7498056,5,B01793CMPQ,"In a world so full of darkness and confusion, movies such as this gives one a renewed sense of confidence that God is there for us and with us. And that God has a purpose wrapped in His love for our good in both good and horrific circumstances in this life.  It was wonderful to experience through the movie so many of the bible's messages of wisdom that I believe God wishes to share and bless us with.  A christian and hopefully others will be edified from watching this movie.",1523059200,,479,4.311111111111111
7498057,5,B01793CMPQ,Great movie!,1522540800,,12,5.5
7498058,5,B01793CMPQ,"Excellent movie. It answered so many of my ""why God"" questions.  Made me realize also just how really and truly blessed I am.",1522195200,2,125,4.434782608695652
7498059,4,B01793CMPQ,"Through a terrible experience the former boxer is taught to be grateful
 for what he has in his life at the moment that
a stranger helps him with the renewed gratitude book and journal.
It is slow at times but the ideas are good to soak in.
I really like the character Malachi Carpenter(Kibwe Dorsey)
and how he helps the boxer.",1522108800,,328,4.377049180327869
7498060,3,B01793CMPQ,Great message. Production and acting were adequate.,1521763200,,51,6.428571428571429
7498061,4,B01793CMPQ,"This came along just when I needed it.  it really touched home.  It was a slow start but once I got into it I had to finish it and I am glad
I did.  It has helped me to come to a decision to move on.",1521763200,,199,3.282608695652174
7498062,4,B01793CMPQ,"The slow parts do give you time to think about the deeper concepts being dramatically presented.  A few of the actors are a bit awkward briefly.  It does all come together and make sense in the end.  I thought it was kind of cool and will probably think of it again in the coming weeks.  It's not meant to be a fast action drama though, but meant to be slowly savored story with characters with whom we can relate.",1521763200,,414,4.2025316455696204
7498063,5,B01793CMPQ,"The plot in this movie was creative and thought provoking. The acting wasn't great at times, and it was a little slow at points, but I felt intuitively that I should watch it through. The last 15 minutes or so were very meaningful to me. I'm so grateful it is available on amazon for streaming.",1521763200,,294,4.363636363636363
7498064,3,B01793CMPQ,"Good concepts and family oriented but fairly awkward at times. Slow paced after the opening boxing scene, not for everyone.",1521244800,,123,5.2

7498067,5,B01793CMPQ,"Very speechless, and touch. The bible said to walk by faith not by sight. It is not what it look like. Everyone have to go to the storm to get to the rainbow. Only strong survive.",1518825600,2,179,4.0
7498068,5,B01793CMPQ,I really loved this movie.  I watched it because I had enjoyed Wade Williams in The Investigator. But this story was a delightful surprise.,1518480000,,139,4.791666666666667
7498069,5,B01793CMPQ,It was really good I was surprised that I really enojoyed this movie. Shows what blessings we still have even during our dark times. God is always there! Loved the actors especially  malachi carpenters character. Watch it.,1517443200,3,222,5.0
7498070,4,B01793CMPQ,Good movie in my opinion. Alot of thought provoking moments throughout the movie. Actor (Wade Williams) brings a very strong approach and realistic response to someone who is searching for purpose and meaning in life in the midst of tragedy when all hope is gone and you don't know where to turn to next. I think because it mirrors his real life experience to an extent that he's shared in several interviews he is really able to embody this seeking character and highlight that realism. Enjoy!,1495670400,3,494,4.755813953488372
8738419,4,B01793CMPQ,"A wholesome movie. Simple yet has applications of life's deep questions that we wonder about. It is hard enough to figure out our lives Let alone how all of our lives are more so intertwined with others that we had no idea of. This movie propels the message that is echoed in the Bible that much of our lives will remain a mystery yet when we put our trust in God, and seek His kingdom all things do work out with our divine purpose in mind.",1535155200,,441,4.1395348837209305

8738423,5,B01793CMPQ,It shared a great life lesson that everyone goes through one time or another and it helps you see he right path to take.  I enjoyed the  movie!,1533340800,,143,4.071428571428571
8738424,5,B01793CMPQ,"May not have been a big budget movie but the message was the cream of this film.  I was surprised I even liked it.  I initially thought that this movie was going to be a waste of time but what a grand mistake! We are so misdirected by multi-billion dollar movies nowadays that we often forget that all that glitters is not always gold.  The message & the lesson is the true treasure.  Wonder if this movie is in book format as well.  In any case, watching the movie was well worth the time invested.  See for yourself.",1530403200,,518,4.23469387755102
8738425,5,B01793CMPQ,Some people will think that it was too scripted or the outcome not likely. If you know God then you know that's not true.,1529798400,,121,4.083333333333333
8738426,1,B01793CMPQ,I'll admit right up front I did not watch all of this movie but judging from what I did see in the first 30 minutes I would say you would have to be a glutton for punishment to finish it.  It's hard to say what is the worse thing about this movie the script or the music.  If I could turn off the awful music I might could have finished it.  Thumbs down on this one.,1529193600,,366,3.789473684210526
8738427,5,B01793CMPQ,The true symbolism in this movie has reminded me of all the things i need to be thankful for and grateful for. Take every situation as if you are speaking to angel or God Himself. An amazing Christian movie. Thank you so much for the reminder. God Bless!!!,1528329600,,256,4.354166666666667
8738428,1,B01793CMPQ,"A boxer accidentally kills his opponent in a fight.  After losing his job, home and life as he knows it, he hits rock bottom.  A stranger takes him under his wing and shows him . . .?

I guess that's where I get lost.  What does he show him?  I think the movie attempts to answer very complex questions about human suffering in an over-simplified way, and fails pretty miserably.  At the start of the movie, the main character is so bitter and angry and shouting and it was a bit too much.  When bad things happen, it is common for one to ask, ""why?"" but  the answers given here are a little strange and not theologically sound.  To the effect of:  don't ask God questions He can't answer (??); and yes, I was hit by a drunk driver, but it was my decision to get into the car that day...

At the end when he meets the victim's family, their reasoning is unreasonable.  The story is contrived, and I'm pretty sure the details contradict what we're told in the beginning of the story.

Part of the story is that the characters carry a journal in which they write down things for which they are grateful.  I think if that piece had a greater focus in the movie by showing how gratitude to God and others was helping the healing process would have been more effective than the testimonies with bad theology. There are a couple good or interesting points made, so it wasn't a total waste.  The ""twist"" at the ending was foreseeable, but I'm not sure what our exact take-away was supposed to be.

Bridgestone movies are kind of hit or miss.  It's nice to be able to watch these on prime, knowing they are lower budget, but have a good message. Lots of people liked this movie, so maybe give it a shot,",1528156800,,1695,4.313291139240507
