8253260,2,B0013XZ6QG,"When I purchased this item, Amazon claimed that the language of the product would be in English. It is not. At all.

I was expecting audio in Spanish, as that was the language these movies were filmed in, but I expected the option for subtitles in English, based on the product description. There are no subtitles on the disc whatsoever.

Furthermore, the back cover of the case is almost entirely in Spanish. The tiny bit of English is at the very bottom, and just used for phrases like ""Not Rated"" and the location the disc was printed.

I have attempted to edit the product description to correct the language listed, so that others won't be deceived as I was, but right now, I'm incredibly disappointed in Amazon for their dishonesty. (Or for not checking the validity of the description provided to them at the very least!)

As for the films themselves, I saw them before buying this product, and they're the height of glorious B-Movie cheese. Incredibly entertaining stuff, and if you're into B-Movies, you'd likely love them.

Unfortunately, along with the lie regarding the product language, it also claims that the movies are goth in color, and the second feature on the disc, ""Santo y Blue Demon Contra Los Monstruos""), is entirely in black & white.",1437350400,2,1259,4.783410138248848

8253264,3,B0013XZ6QG,"Are you a die-hard fan of Lucha Libre, particularly films starring the original Santo and the Blue Demon? If so, you're probably going to want this double feature, if only because there's some well-filmed in-ring action including a match between Santo and Blue Demon in ""La Atlantida."" (Coincidentally, most filmed vintage lucha footage can only be found in these genre films as the televised matches weren't preserved, which makes practically all lucha films from the 1950s through the 1970s valuable for fans of the genre.)These are also some of the earliest on-screen collaborations between Santo and the Blue Demon, so they often have a freshness that's missing in later movies.

Some general notes - this is a double-side disc. There are no subtitles, not even in Spanish, and you can forget about an English dub. The version of ""Los Monstruos"" is in black-and-white which (given the choppy editing) makes me suspect it is a TV print.

Both films are like live-action comic books, which could be said of practically any post-1968 lucha film. To me, these films aren't as much fun as they could be because they look and feel considerably cheaper than the stylish earlier movies. ""La Atlantida"" includes an incredible amount of stock footage not only from Japanese sci-fi films but also an entire musical number lifted from another Mexican movie and the effect is obvious. Speaking of effects, the makeup effects in ""Los Monstruos"" are often dreadful which is a significant flaw in a movie that includes characters such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Mummy as villains. In theory, ""Los Monstruos"" should have been one of the better Santo-Blue Demon teamups but the movie is limited not only by the amateurish monster makeup but also by its almost totally repetitive nature. It often reminded me of the cheaper movie serials that were cranked out as that particular genre was dying. In both cases, it seems as if the films' ambitions far exceeded their budgets and they suffer as a result. I can imagine them playing much, much better to their original audiences, who may not have been able to see Santo and the Blue Demon on TV and for whom seeing them on the big screen brought to life sports heroes they'd only heard on the radio or read about in ""Box y Lucha.""

With that in mind, if you aren't a lucha die-hard, these aren't the first films I'd recommend. Start off with ""Santo en el Museo de Cera"" which is an undeniable classic.",1346889600,5,2454,4.838095238095238

8253266,1,B0013XZ6QG,"Santo and B.D. vs. the Monsters is HILARIOUS good fun, but we saw it in color on a big screen at a university showing; imdb says it's in color; AMAZON says it's in color.

IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE on this disc.  That's just wrong.  It sucketh in black and white.  It's not supposed to be in black and white.  Amazon, change your specs on this DVD!",1277683200,6,346,4.104477611940299
8253267,3,B0013XZ6QG,"Undoubtably the best movies made by luchador legends el Santo and Blue Demon were made prior to 1968. Santo vs. The Vampire Women and Blue Demon and The Shadow of The Bat are classics of the Mexiluchahero genre. But Santo contra Blue Demon en la  Atlantida and Santo y Blue Demon contra las Monstruos(both made in 1969) are two pretty good later entries. The first film is a lot of fun with a comic book-like plot that has an ex-Nazi scientist headquartered on Atlantis planning on taking over the world. During the course of the movie the Blue Demon is brainwashed and he and el Santo throw down, just like the heroes in a Marvel comic book from that era would, before teaming up to beat the bad guys. The second film is the more famous of the pair and if you like cheesy fun this is the film for you. This is a high concept movie that's title says it all. The two wrestling superstars take on a wolfman,a vampire and his two sexy lingerie-clad consorts,a reptilian cyclops,a mummy,and the Frankenstein(here called Franquestein)monster. Or should I say Santo takes them on. In the previous film Blue Demon is brainwashed and spends most of his screentime opposing ""the man in the silver mask"".This time out he's kidnapped by the bad guys who substitute an android double for the real luchador. The real Blue Demon does come through in the film's climax as he and Santo fight the villians in a free for all. The production values in these two films aren't as high here as they were in earlier entries. In some places they look like some of Don Glut's early student films and there's a decided lack of atmosphere in the second film. Still both films are entertaining and worth a look.",1254873600,,1683,4.554455445544554
8253268,5,B0013XZ6QG,"I don't speak Spanish and couldn't understand a word of this two-feature DVD (there are no subtitles) but I can still confidently state that Santo and Blue Demon versus the Monsters is one of the best films I have ever seen. It stars six different monsters: Mummy, Cyclops, Vampiro, Lady Vampiro, Wolfman and Frankenstein. Because the action occurs in Mexico the monsters look a little different than they do in America. I especially liked the Mexican version of Dracula.

It is also good to see Cyclops getting some screen time. He has been woefully underrepresented on the American screen.

Monsters is black and white, but that is okay. As usual there are some beautiful females, both good and bad, in the film.

I heartily recommend this film for fans of either monster or rassling movies. A friend from Puerto Rico tells me that he remembers watching this film on Sunday afternoon on TV, so you know that Santo is the real deal. He died in 1984, and except for one moment of weakness a week before he died he never once removed his mask in public.

Santo is like a Mexican James Bond in that respect. He is also immaculately dressed. Even when he is beating up bad guys he usually wears a nice sports jacket that matches his mask. No wonder the girls go crazy over him.

What a man.",1217030400,12,1287,4.554112554112554
