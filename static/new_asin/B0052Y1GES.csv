8454766,5,B0052Y1GES,Great DVD.  Enjoyed seeing the midgets again as I used watch my uncle race these cars in the 40's and 50's.  Mel Anthony----what a classic.,1365984000,,139,4.52
8454767,5,B0052Y1GES,"I bought this video mainly due to it having track roadster footage... but all in all i thought it sounded good... it lived up to my expectations... great video about a great guy

the only complaint is that you have to go one by one through all the special features rather then a ""play all"" feature.... but that is not really even worth mentioning

if you like old oval track racing and vintage racing from now... check it out!",1336089600,,426,4.379746835443038
