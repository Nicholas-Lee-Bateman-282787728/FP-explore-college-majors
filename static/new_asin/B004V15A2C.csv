4478836,5,B004V15A2C,This video is a MUST buy! I saw results in a couple of weeks! It definitely found muscles I didn't even know I had!,1310601600,4,115,3.8333333333333335
4478837,5,B004V15A2C,"This is the most comprehensive workout DVD to date.  80 minutes worth of workouts in 1 DVD. It has everything I need including toning, cardio, tons of abdominal work, stretches and a workout I can do with my baby.  Look no further, this is the best.",1302825600,7,249,4.391304347826087
4478913,2,B004V15A2C,"I didn't realize that I would need small fitness balls to do most of the exercises on this dvd.  I already have a good amount of exercise equipment so I'm not excited about having more to clutter up my living room.  Also, very few of the exercises involved the baby.",1333670400,3,266,4.3
4478914,5,B004V15A2C,Getting into a workout regimen post pregnancy is not easy.  I was constantly trying to squeeze in a workout while baby was sleeping.  I never could complete the whole thing!  This video is awesome.  The quick segments allow me to do as little or as much as babys naps allow and when he wakes we do the mommy and me segment.  He loves it!  The busy mom bootcamp segment is great cardio and I felt such a sence of accomplishment when I was able to do the segment more than once.  I highly recommend!,1333324800,4,497,4.223404255319149
4478915,2,B004V15A2C,"There is only one workout with baby on here. I was thinking that I would get to use my baby as a weight or something, but even part of the mommy-baby workout is just doing exercises while your baby is near you.

I was also kind of shocked to see how out of shape this woman was. I get it- she just had a baby. But I would much rather take my workout advice from someone who isn't desperately sucking in her stomach.

Lastly, you need a a ball to do some of these exercises. I was pretty disappointed with this video.",1331856000,6,516,4.049019607843137
4478916,4,B004V15A2C,"I purchased this DVD after the birth of my third child and wanting to ease back into exercise in the comfort of my own home. Patricia's workouts include an abdominal rehab segment, a toning segment, baby and me segment, a cardio "" busy mom boot camp"" and a rejuvination stretch. I was 12 weeks post partum when I started the workouts. I really enjoy the toning workout. It is a fun yoga and pilates inspired workout that has helped strengthen and rehab my pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. This workout does require a small fitness ball and resistance band which I wasen't aware of before I purchased. I improvised with one of children's toy balls and already had a resistance band. The boot camp cardio workout is also good but I didn't find it very challenging after the first week and it is only 15 minutes. The baby workout is cute and my son seemed to enjoy it at nearly 3 months. It is nice for those days that working out isn't really an option and at least you can get some stretching and core work in. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to other moms.",1328572800,17,1084,4.425
4478917,5,B004V15A2C,"After having 2 back to back babies and 2 c-sections, I needed to get my figure back, and I also wanted a DVD I could do at home.  This is the perfect DVD for busy moms.  Patricia's fun, easy to follow program is a great way to get back into shape.  I highly recommend it!!!",1328227200,,273,3.9272727272727272
4478918,5,B004V15A2C,Patricia Friberg is amazing and totally knowledgeable.  It is clear that she has so much experience and loves what she does.  Her energy is fantastic and she helped put my stomach back together after babies.  Nice to have someone who actually went through childbirth teach me how to get my body back instead of someone who never even has had a child before.  Patricia's DVD is the best.,1327968000,3,386,4.632352941176471
4478919,4,B004V15A2C,Today is my first day of working out since having a baby.  My son is 4 months old and I enjoyed working out with him. I really like that it's easy to follow and it's something I can see myself doing for a long time. Can't wait to see the results. I highly recommend this DVD.,1327536000,3,275,3.9107142857142856
4478920,5,B004V15A2C,"I bought this DVD because I had surgery that damaged my muscles the same way a c-section would. I had heard from friends about Patricia's DVDs and the great results they achieved so I bought the Belly Beautiful Workout. I only use the `Ab Rehab' and `toning' segments from the video but I am really impressed. I used to not even be able to flex (or suck in) the same way I used to be able since before my operation and now I can flex and show off my beautiful belly! I love how it's a quick 15ish minutes and I get sore. You can adjust the workout to your level and I appreciate how Patricia consistently reminds you to keep proper form, I swear she can see me! Anyway, I highly recommend!",1320969600,8,689,4.18796992481203
4478921,5,B004V15A2C,"this video was a good addition to my collection. Packaging had it scratched up though, but it ran as brand new. Good ideas to get back in shape. uses real baby. fun looking. quick and easy workouts for keeping you interested. many tips i had never heard mentioned before, that was a plus. Simple tools to use with video available at most any sports store and wallmart. Good use of your money. I am very happy.",1319500800,4,409,4.394736842105263
4478922,5,B004V15A2C,"Loved, loved, loved this video. Even though I'm not a new mom (my youngest daughter is three years old) it is toning muscles I thought I lost a long time ago. It is a great workout - easy, fast and fun! I'm recommending it to all my mom friends.",1317686400,6,245,4.020408163265306
8442528,4,B004V15A2C,Good pace for beginners or starting back slow. But not a lot of time with baby. It's more for yourself. But I still like it - just finding the tie to do a little for yourself.,1448928000,,175,3.888888888888889
8442529,5,B004V15A2C,"Great for getting back in shape after having a baby!  Love that there are different segments for you to choose from.  Allows for you to do one if short on time, or combine them for longer workout.  Great video!",1418688000,,210,4.333333333333333
8442530,1,B004V15A2C,"I am not much of a reviewer - but this is an absolutely ridiculous video.  The ""special"" segment on diastasis recti would have been helpful if she provided an example WITH a towel.  I mean, did she forget the towel on the recording day, was it out of the budget?  Why did she have to pretend to have a towel?  I feel that the overall video is VERY basic movements NOT challenging. I also found it odd that this is SO basic yet she didn't really explain any of the actual movements.  Like where are your sit bones, specific information on the poses, etc.  I already know it, but for someone who is new to working out. . . they'd be lost and/or doing it incorrectly.",1413676800,,664,4.23015873015873
8442531,4,B004V15A2C,"It's an easy fast workout. It does require done yoga supplies, but it wasn't as challenging as I hoped for after all it is post natal so that may be why",1367452800,,152,3.935483870967742
8442532,1,B004V15A2C,"This was a dissapointing waste of money. I regret buying it. And hate that I invested in it. If I could return it and get my money back, I would!",1364169600,,145,3.8666666666666667
8442533,5,B004V15A2C,"Love, Love, LOVE the Belly Beautiful workout! I have always been an active person even throughout my pregnancy but the muscle separation is the one area I truly had no clue how to get back into shape. This workout is not only fun but allows me to fit in a daily routine no matter how unpredictable my day may be. I love that I can include my baby in my workout or squeeze in some ""me"" time while she naps. I'm still working on the tummy toning but extremely pleased with the results so far! Thank you Patricia! You're FABULOUS!",1351900800,3,527,4.28
8442534,2,B004V15A2C,When I bought this DVD I was not made aware that it requires other fitness equipment I don't own. It requires te big yoga ball as well as the bands.  Thus I did not use this DVD but one time since I didn't have the other equipment. Moreover it is not advanced enough for me.,1350172800,3,274,3.981818181818182
8442535,5,B004V15A2C,"Good exercises post natal and beyond. These exercises are excellent for doing at home when you have time in between looking after your precious little ones. Effective in toning and easy to understand instructions. Great workouts that you can actually ""do"" and want to do. These exercises can be done years after you have given birth.

8442536,5,B004V15A2C,"This is a great workout for those who just had a baby. I just had my third baby and have been working on getting my transverse muscles back in shape and I feel that this dvd is doing just that with out damaging them anymore. For those not aware, you can't do crunches and other types of movements until the transverse are closed.",1335052800,8,329,4.238095238095238
8442537,5,B004V15A2C,"This DVD is great, the exercises are easy to do when you only have 15 to 30 minutes, and they are helpful, I feel stronger already after using this DVD for a month. I would recommend it for new moms.",1334707200,3,199,4.0
