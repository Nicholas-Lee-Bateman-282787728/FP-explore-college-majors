7828378,4,6302622913,"This one isn't even on DVD yet. I still have a VHS player, so bought it anyway. Mickey Rourke plays the part of a crazed serial killer. Really old TV movie. He looks so young in this one; 1979. He was really young in this one. Lol  Enjoyed watching this. Must have missed this somehow. I have been watching his stuff since the very late 70's and all through the 80's, 90's, up to the present. If you are a Mickey Rourke Junkie, you should have this. Easy ordering from Amazon.com and fast delivery.",1430956800,,498,4.297872340425532

7828381,4,6302622913,"David Janssen gives a Tour De Force in his last performance as a news columnist. Robert Vaughn plays a worthy advisory as his boss/publisher. The cast is full of TV/Movie veterans including William Daniels,Lane Smith,Perry King,Allan Miller,Susan Sullivan,and M Emmet Walsh. The story loosely based on the 'Son of Sam' hysteria of the 70's has aged well.  There are three views of this story;the newspaper coverage,the killer,and the police investigation. It works best from newspaper coverage followed by the killer's(Rourke's)view. The police investigation is the weakest. Despite that shortcoming the acting and dialogue is first rate. The characters are shown to be multidimentional with strength and flaws.  Despite the fact it has not been released on DVD it is worth seeking out.",1290902400,6,786,5.434426229508197
