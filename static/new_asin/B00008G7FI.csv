These dvds arn't the best when it comes to having extras and the dvd quality is the same as an ok copy of an ex rental vhs haha...but hey...that just adds more charm to the little horrors!  this box set includes: 'The Gates of Hell 2', 'Night of the Zombies' -aka- 'VIRUS' -aka- 'Hell of the Living Dead', and the 3rd movie is 'ZEDER' -aka- 'Revenge of the Dead'  All three of these dvds come with original title and vhs art work!!!  This is a really AWESOME box set to have; I can't stress that enough haha.  These 3 dvds are placed in regular keepcases, not those dreaded jewel cases some box sets come in haha.  If your a zombie nut like me or you just love obscure horror, than pick this up!",1259798400,,800,4.1558441558441555
7983308,2,B00008G7FI,"Zombie Fest is a three DVD set consisting of the following titles: 1) 'The Gates Of Hell II: Dead Awakening'; an in name only sequel to the Lucio Fulci film. 2) 'Night of the Zombies'; a.k.a. 'Hell of the Living Dead' and 'Zombie: Creeping Flesh'. 3) 'Revenge of the Dead'; a.k.a. 'Zeder'.--These are the Creature Features releases that are not much better quality than their VHS counterparts (which means not very good). The Creature Features disc of 'Revenge of the Dead' ('Zeder') is missing ten minutes of the film including important scenes which basically slaughters the film and unfortunately a lot of reviewers have based their reviews on the slaughtered version. For a complete version of 'Revenge of the Dead' check in the VHS used listings for the Lightning Video release which is often listed by the sellers as having different cover art than that shown on the page (see my review on that page for further information). The disc of 'Night of the Zombies' is complete but a poor quality print; the 'Hell of the Living Dead' DVD, which Amazon carries, is a much better deal. Since I have not watched 'The Gates Of Hell II: Dead Awakening' DVD, I cannot comment, although I do believe this title is only available from this company. Creature Features unfortunately has a bad habit of cutting films (apparently at random) to get them under ninety minutes. Their poor quality and lack of concern with regard to the continuity and content of films makes them a poor investment unless you can get the set for a cheap price.--Bob",1102032000,8,1533,4.788679245283019
