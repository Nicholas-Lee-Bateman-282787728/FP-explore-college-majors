When you don't do this odds are you're going to wind up with one review since 1997 of 2 stars at best. As you can tell the brothers Sid were a bit let down with the feature of the evening ""Real Thing"" due to Gary only getting about 3 minutes of total screen time. And after watching his captivating performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-the-Tiger/dp/B0006TPDR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of the Tiger</a>&nbsp;last week that lack of screen presence just isn't going to cut it. Now we give them credit for casting a young, yet really old looking, Ari Gold and Richie Valen's drunken La Bamba brother Bob Morales but it just wasn't enough to push this one above the 2 star rating.

The story here centers around a bunch of dead beat convicts. Rupert's younger brother James, fresh out of prison, winds up getting gunned down putting him in need of a liver transplant. So Rupert grabs Ari Gold before starting his agent career and a select group of convicts for a New Year's Eve nightclub heist to get enough cash for the transplant. Yeah New Year's Eve is certainly the best time to pull a stunt like that. Anyway, the same guys that gunned down James already had the plan and wind up showing up at the same time for a battle royal of epic B proportions. Too bad it sounds way cooler then it was. Really the first and last 15 minutes of the film were the only salvaging factors making the whole middle just useless.

Well looks like we really set the bar too high last week making this weeks choices a bit of a let down so far (except for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nighthawks/dp/B0001FGBWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nighthawks</a>). None the less we still enjoy getting our movies in and upping the totals in our extensive vault of B. See with the Real Thing the story was pretty solid and could have been so much better. They really could have executed more in the explosions, fights, and acting departments which would have lead to much much more laughter from us. We weren't looking for anything legit great just something passable in the ""so bad it's good"" section. Busey must have realized what a joke this was and left after a few minutes of filming. This was the time in life he could actually decide what roles he wanted instead of his current status where he probably would have been in this film the entire time. We rate this one as shallow and pedantic, yes I agree shallow and pedantic.",1267142400,2,2660,4.882743362831858
