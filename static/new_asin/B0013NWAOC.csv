8252461,4,B0013NWAOC,"This DVD is good and I use it as part of my ski fitness regime. Be fully aware however that it is about Body Core muscle development. Other aspects of ski fitness such as leg strength exercises are not covered. It is therefore not a complete ski training course. You will need at least some fitness equipment to do most exercises, such as a balance ball and dumbbells as a minimum. Some of the rest you can improvise with a bit of thought. As well as videos of the various exercises, it includes PDFs which suggest various workouts, etc. You can even put together your own program and download it to ipods, etc, although I haven't tried this.",1296000000,,642,4.4491525423728815
