5724404,5,B00CJH1QIW,"I was looking for a dvd to use when I couldn't make a Zumba Sentao class (which I usually take once a week) along with a regular Zumba class.  This dvd works for me as it has the toning sticks segment then the chair exercise segment.  What I liked best was Beto (founder) was instructing.  Once you realize you are not going to have the same ""party"" experience as an actual class (I have a super instructor), it does work as a supplement.  It's an hour dvd, just like the class.  Today I didn't have a whole hour at once so did the toning segment in the a.m. and the chair segment in the p.m.  I use a folding chair.",1377734400,12,616,4.091666666666667
5724405,4,B00CJH1QIW,"I like it because it is Different than what we are doing in the Zumba Class that I have twice A week.
The reason that I bought the DVD was so if I went out of town & had to Miss my Zumba class that I
would Have Something That I could do,But I have Decided to Incorporate it into my weekly Exercise Schedule
& I Hope to teach the Class some of the New things that Are in the DVD.
I Would Recommend it for anyone that has been doing Zumba for a While,I wouldn't recommend it for a Beginner
since it is fast paced. It is two Parts the First part is Toning & the Second part you will need a Chair.",1372118400,10,593,3.7903225806451615
5724406,5,B00CJH1QIW,Received in timely fashion.  Excellent workout!,1405814400,,47,6.833333333333333
5724407,1,B00CJH1QIW,"I was very excited to introduce this DVD into my work out. I am very disappointed that as I was using the DVD the last two workouts skip,drag, and come to a stop. I had to start and restart the DVD so I could finish. I am very disappointed. I am going to try to find another Zumba Ripped DVD soon.",1402185600,2,297,3.8852459016393444
5724408,5,B00CJH1QIW,"Really gets your blood flowing. At first, it was hard to pay attention to the music and the weights at the same time. You have to stick with it and you'll end up dancing!",1398470400,,170,4.029411764705882
5724409,5,B00CJH1QIW,Perfect condition and this dvd was my favorite out of the set. It also includes the chair portion that isn't included on the first production of this dvd.,1395964800,3,154,4.535714285714286
5724410,5,B00CJH1QIW,"Great way to work arms and torso without getting on the floor! The 2 half hour sessions are good to do back to back when time isn't an issue. But if 30 minutes is all you have, you'll still feel like you did something.",1394841600,4,218,3.977272727272727
5724411,5,B00CJH1QIW,It's has a lot of great and easy moves!! Great music in the background and instructors were lots of fun.,1393977600,2,104,4.25
5724412,5,B00CJH1QIW,"Love that this is split in two parts! I am able to switch out every other day. Zumba is truly a fun way to get in a workout. This DVD was perfect for me because I didn't need to lose the weight just tone things up. I've only been doing it for a month and already I see my abs again. Do not recommend for beginners, though. Its very fast paced even in the learn it option. However,I find this pace keeps me motivated.",1393804800,,416,3.9642857142857144
5724413,3,B00CJH1QIW,Good exercise but host is slightly creepy.  Like the two different sections.  Queing for moves should be faster.  Need for chair is a pain,1392508800,,138,4.666666666666667
5724414,5,B00CJH1QIW,Easy to learn routines! A great workout! ! I love Zumba and Beto Toning and workouts using a chair. ;),1391472000,2,102,4.15

8582558,4,B00CJH1QIW,"I enjoy doing Zumba and have really enjoyed this DVD.  The workout with the Zumba toning sticks is wonderful.  The workout with the chair is good as well, but really fast.  I'm going to have to spend lots of time learning it.",1427760000,,225,4.309523809523809

8582560,2,B00CJH1QIW,"This dvd is way too easy.  I barely broke a sweat and since I'm used to heavier weights, the sticks that one uses for the weight lifting section were a joke.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It was a complete waste of money.",1416096000,,218,4.023255813953488
