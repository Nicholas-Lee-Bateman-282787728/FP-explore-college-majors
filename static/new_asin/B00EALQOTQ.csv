5899601,5,B00EALQOTQ,I have been a MM collector for many years and i was so happy to see a HBO special on dvd. This sells at Barnes and Noble for $26 so the value thru amazon is great! Its a very good movie and every Marilyn fan should have this!,1389398400,8,225,3.7083333333333335
5899602,4,B00EALQOTQ,"Love, Marilyn is a biographical documentary of Marylyn Monroe, most notable for the way in which the subject matter is presented. Along with a wealth of archive footage and interviews, Liz Garbus documentary follows the life story of the worlds most famous actress (and criminally underrated talent) with sections of ten actresses reading before the camera the long unpublished personal writings by Marylyn Monroe herself.

So Marylyn Monroes writings including her diaries, poems and letters (now published as a book Fragments: Poems, Intimate Notes, Letters by Stanley Buchthal and Bernard Comment) are read by Elizabeth Banks, Ellen Burstyn, Glenn Close, Viola Davis, Jennifer Ehle, Lindsay Lohan, Lili Taylor, Uma Thurman, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood.

The film also features other actors and actresses reading the writings by such people as Truman Capote (read by Adrien Brody), George Cukor (Paul Giamatti), Natasha Lytess (Janet McTeer), Norman Mailer (Ben Foster) and Billy Wilder (Oliver Platt). It is quite amusing to see what these talented players can do.

As a bio-pic Love, Marilyn, entertaining and informative as it is, does not add much to what we already know about Marylyn Monroe. Just half a century has passed since her untimely death, and much (or too much) has been written about her, but she still remains a mystery. Maybe that should be so. But her personal words are something different, charming, intelligent and sad. And these narrators give voice to those words.",1389312000,4,1497,5.2552301255230125
5899603,4,B00EALQOTQ,Very interesting seeing actors read her own words and other people who knew her. A great look inside her mind.,1389139200,6,110,4.55
5899604,5,B00EALQOTQ,"This 2012 HBO documentary is now on DVD from Docurama through Cinedigm. I did not see it on HBO but am glad it is out on DVD, especially for those who remember Marilyn Monroe at the height of her career.

This is probably one of the most unorthodox documentaries Ive seen and it took a while to get into the directors method of telling the story. Yes, there are some new, as well as archival, interview segments, but much of the story of Monroes life is told by having a cast of about 22 mostly-well-known actors ( Glenn Close, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei and Jeremy Piven among them) read from both Monroes personally diaries and papers (recently discovered) as well as documents from director Billy Wilder, studio head Daryl Zanuck and others.  But these actors are never identified on the screen and, though they are listed in the final credit, quite a few were unrecognizable to me. Maybe you are, but the names of Jennifer Ehle, Ben Foster and Elizabeth Banks, are not actors whose names I recognize. (Talk about name recognition; we have Lindsey Lohan as one of the readers . But, as I said, I soon found myself more interested in the story than who was reading the words.

As youll see from the lengthy End Credits there are lots of archives who contributed to the film clips used. There are also audio tapes of Monroe which are very revealing. As is stated at the beginning, over 1,000 biographies have been written of this superstar, and at least a half-dozen are interviewed on screen.  The film is long  at nearly two-hours  but never sags. And the often-contemporary soundtrack of recordings adds to the enjoyment.
The DVD has no bonus features  Just  Play Movie and Chapter Selection options.

If you missed it on HBO (which does some great documentaries) and are interested in holly films  especially how studios controlled their contract players, I can highly recommend this DVD. If you are a Monroe fan, then its a must see.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5899605,4,B00EALQOTQ,"The documentary, for the most part, was uniquely personal and interesting. I felt Marilyn Monroe herself would have approved of it, because finally her voice comes through and people are not speaking for her (she is speaking for herself). However, I don't think Norman Mailer's excerpts were crucial. In fact, I found his words about her crude and slightly disrespectful. Furthermore, I don't think there needed to be several actresses playing ""Marilyn Monroe"" and only one actor playing her psychiatrist, or her director, or stage coach. One actress who is capable of playing a convincing Marilyn Monroe could have done the documentary and Monroe herself justice. That said, the documentary was respectful of the famous screen legend and, most importantly, had her voice all over it. Finally, (the real) Marilyn Monroe on Marilyn Monroe.",1387584000,27,838,5.2611940298507465
5899606,5,B00EALQOTQ,Very emotional and you see her in a new light.  Great actors portraying real Hollywood players in M's life. <3,1387584000,4,110,4.5
5899607,5,B00EALQOTQ,"I absolutely loved t he directing, casting, and even musical and other audios used. Everything was perfect. I loved how the characters, especially Marisa Tomei for me, real tried to encompass the persons they were portraying. Even in the silent scenes where the actresses would just depict the anxiety and uneasiness of Monroe, fantastic acting. There were even bits of humor (The Wilder notes with Miller were too funny). I can't wait for the release. I haven't paid this much for a DVD that didn't come with a Blu-ray and digital code in forever but I will definitely swallow my pride on this purchase.",1385856000,18,604,4.8173076923076925
5899608,5,B00EALQOTQ,"When I saw this documentary it aired on HBO and was 2hrs long. I wasn't really sure about it at first, but was won over. Mainly, we get to hear readings of Marylin's personal diary entries, snippets of peoples books about her, some videos of her and her calendar photos. All in all I loved it, but I have only read her autobiography and do not know a ton about her. The one part I felt this film lacked was that there was nothing about her and the Kennedys in it, and I was hoping there would be since a lot of people blame him for her death.",1382054400,5,542,4.027777777777778

5899611,3,B00EALQOTQ,"Good content where different actors and actresses read quotes from Marilyn with archive movie scenes - which were good. The women who read quotes were all mature and very good. But most of the ""men"" looked like very young actors - too young - and I didn't like them at all.",1454889600,,273,4.372549019607843
5899612,4,B00EALQOTQ,"I enjoyed watching this film. From the stars who read Marilyn's words to the imagery of Marilyn herself, this is a fan favorite. I recommend it to all Marilyn fans.",1453334400,,164,4.5
5899613,5,B00EALQOTQ,"Amazing footage of her. She's so gorgeous and I hate to see how badly she was basically mistreated or not given credit. I think the world wasn't ready for such a beautiful person then. She had a bad childhood and still went on to try to do something, but again she was mistreated. She wasn't a crazy mess, she just wanted to be loved and unfortunately that never happened. I believe the only person who truly loved her was Joe DiMaggio. It's sad it took her life to be cut way to short for her to be such an admired icon. I hope she's looking down at the world and all her fans and finally feels she is loved. Rest in paradise Marilyn Monroe xoxo",1453334400,,646,4.176

5899618,3,B00EALQOTQ,"This film tries very hard to be good but just feels too earnest. I adore all things MM and appreciate the wonderful effort that this film makes
but alas even Meryl Streep can't save it. Still, a truly devoted MM will want to rent and watch this for the tribute it attempts. Uma Thurman shines in this though. Her monologues alone make it worth the investment of your time and money.",1446163200,,382,4.394366197183099

5899629,5,B00EALQOTQ,"This is a nice documentary about MArilyn Monroe, It is more authentic cause the documentary technically indicated the fact that it was marilyn's own words that was in this documentary. We kinda being able to dove into marilyn's psyche and really inhaling her thoughts and emotions at that time. So, far this is the only authentic documentary of Marilyn monroe's life..

5899631,5,B00EALQOTQ,"Being a huge Marilyn fan since childhood, I have always been more interested in the woman than the films, seeing the latter as both an extension and prison of her talents.  When I stumbled upon the exhibition at Ferragamo in Florence, I was deeply moved by the thought and detail and the integrity in which her most private notes and journals were displayed.  Instead of making a mockery of her vulnerability or the image which both freed and confined her, I was able to get to know more about the human being behind the myth.  Love, Marilyn does this in the form of film.  Honest, straight-forward and deeply moving, the documentary showcases the sides of Monroe that were at direct odds with not only her image, but life as a whole.  I feel a deep and personal connection to Marilyn (Norma Jeane Mortenson) and understand the demons she battled and I appreciated having the chance to hear about her thoughts and feelings, desires and dreams through her own writings and words instead of through the projections of a writer, lover or fan.  Definitely a solid gift for any Marilyn, History or Movie buff.",1419638400,3,1104,4.694300518134715
5899632,5,B00EALQOTQ,"Love, Marilyn was the very best documentary of MM.  It was great that contemporary actors like Elizabeth Banks and others, male and female gave their take on her.  This movie showed so many new details of Marilyn's complex emotions and her life.",1417910400,2,245,4.809523809523809
5899633,2,B00EALQOTQ,"This did not do much for me.  It did not capture the cuteness and care- free persona that was Marilyn's. That is what made her so special and without those characteristics I just could not get into the presentation.  The only other starlet that had that cuteness was Brittany Murphy.
Sad isn't it.  Very talented fragile creatures.",1417132800,,331,4.771929824561403

5899648,5,B00EALQOTQ,"I managed to catch this when it aired on HBO and it completely changed my view of Marilyn. I've always thought of her as a fabulous icon (the image most people have of her), but never had I imagined that she was so deep and intelligent. I made the same mistake that a lot of people make -I let myself assume there wasn't much more to her than meets the eye. But, after hearing her personal journal entries and random musings, and hearing accounts from people who knew her, I now realize what a disservice I was doing to her memory by not thinking of her as the thoughtful, multi-layered, truly special person that she was.
I haven't bought the DVD yet, but I certainly will now that I've found it on Amazon. I know it's something I'll want to watch over and over again, because I'm sure I'll get something new out of it each time I do. Seeing this documentary has sparked in me a newfound respect and admiration for Marilyn. She is even more beautiful to me now as a person than she ever was as an icon or sex symbol.

To me, Marilyn Monroe is an endlessly fascinating subject. Add to that the inclusion of material from some of her journals which have been recently found after years of being buried in boxes - material which paint a seemingly complete and illuminating portrait of M.M., as both an artist and a human being.
