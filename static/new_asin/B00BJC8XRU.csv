8569600,4,B00BJC8XRU,"Miracle Mile is a fantastic movie ! No film made me so afraid. And it's beautiful to. Well, the movie isn't edited in France, or Europe, in zone 2. What a shame! Do you know if there are subtitles on this dvd for Miracle Mile? And if it's really ""all regions""? Thanks!",1423872000,,268,4.173076923076923
8569601,4,B00BJC8XRU,There has been some speculation that THIS version of Miracle Mile is letterbox. It is NOT. It is the exact same as the other version (single movie version which actually comes with 1984 on it as well). There is NO LETTERBOX version of this film. Both are 4:3 squished into a letterbox looking format. Fake letterbox. :(,1420675200,,319,4.614035087719298
8569602,5,B00BJC8XRU,"To those who might be interested, the TGG Direct edition of Miracle Mile is, indeed, widescreen, not full frame.
There are black bars, but the whole image IS there: it might not be ideal, but it sure beats the full frame format from all of the previous editions (the only reason I refrained from purchasing any of them).
I'm adding a few ssnapshots for clarity's sake.",1410393600,,368,4.590909090909091
8569603,4,B00BJC8XRU,Manhattan project was one of the iconic movies of my youth... I just didn't realize the lead was the guy from Starfighter but neat to realize that in later years. This is also probably the only thing I've ever seen cynthia nixon in so... at least I can still say I've never heard a justin beiber song =),1385683200,,303,4.241379310344827
8569604,3,B00BJC8XRU,"'Miracle Mile' is one of the more quirky and exciting of forgotten '80s films, and has long been one of my favorites. 'The Manhattan Project' is a fun romp, and it's always a trip to see a young fresh-faced long-haired Cynthia Nixon in one of her earlier performances.

I was hoping to get a true 'Miracle Mile' widescreen transfer. It appears to be the 1:33 print matted down to a 1:85. Perhaps this is the way it was released originally in the theaters. My player shrinks the letterbox down, so if I zoom the image on my TV to fill the screen, I get the exact same image as if I zoomed the original MGM DVD release. That's a little disappointing.",1385337600,5,648,4.355371900826446
8569605,5,B00BJC8XRU,"This review is for the burn-on-demand Nuclear Double Feature DVD set of ""Miracle Mile"" and ""The Manhattan Project"".

The two DVD set is housed in one keep case.  Each film is presented in letter boxed 1.85:1 wide screen.  There are no extras for either film - none.

""MIRACLE MILE"", 1988 is a fun, nerve-rattling tale of a man (Anthony Edwards) who answers a pay phone call intended for someone else and is told that nuclear war is about to begin.

If you haven't seen the movie, get this DVD and find out what happens next for yourself - because, I'm not going spoil it for you.  Like all movies, this one demands a little suspension of critical thinking on the viewers' part.  The obligatory just-met girlfriend (Mare Winningham) is given the thankless task of making us believe a grown woman would blindly follow someone she just met they way her character is written.  The out-of-date technology is obvious, but not too off-putting.

The photography is beautifully done and perfectly composed for the 1.85:1 format seen here.  The old full frame edition always looked at bit off.  (Notice when the restaurant owner jumps on the counter with a gun.  Think about how much less effective that was in full frame.))  The hard pounding music serves nicely to build the ever-increasing tension of the plot.

Pop some corn, put your mind in gear for a great exercise in ""what if...?"" and enjoy.

""THE MANHATTAN PROJECT"", 1986 is about a teenager (Christopher Collet) who gets his hands on weapons-grade plutonium and builds a nuclear bomb for a school project.

I've never been able to warm to this movie.  It seems to take to take the teenager-bumbling-into-a- situation-over-his-head premise that Matthew Broderick did so well in ""War Games"" and stretch it way too far beyond an audience's credulity.  Supporting actor John Lithgow's talents seem wasted in big screen film like this.

Let fans review this one.  I'll just leave it alone.

A WORD ABOUT THE LETTER BOXING

Miracle Mile is letter boxed to 1.85:1 for a 4x3 format - and The Manhattan Project is letter boxed to 1.85 for a 16x9 format.  When watching on a wide screen TV, you can set your screen to the desired format.

But if you are watching on an old standard TV, ""Miracle Mile"" will display just fine, but ""The Manhattan Project"" will lose a little of the image on each side.

This set is worth the price (and my 5-Stars rating) for ""Miracle Mile"" alone.  I just consider ""The Manhattan Project"" as unnecessary extra (apologies to fans of the film.)

This set will do nicely until someone releases ""Miracle Mile"" with commentaries, etc.",1381968000,3,2600,4.771300448430493

8569607,5,B00BJC8XRU,Have seen both of these movies many times in the past and loved them both. The Manhattan Project is a bit cutsie but still a pretty good movie. Miracle Mile is a great look at human interaction at a time of great crisis. Definitely a very good story.,1370822400,3,250,4.229166666666667
