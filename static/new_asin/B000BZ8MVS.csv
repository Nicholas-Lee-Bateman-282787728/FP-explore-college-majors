8094634,3,B000BZ8MVS,"As an ex-trombone player I decided to take up the alto sax by myself without a teacher. I found Foresman's demonstration of the sax embouchure and his information about putting the sax together and cleaning the sax extremely useful, but other than that the DVD's content was very limited for me. It is only an hour long and starts off with a jazz tune by Foresman and even a solo by his accompanying pianist, which I think is a waste of time since it doesn't teach you anything, and we all know what the instruments sound like.

If you can't read music then this DVD could be useful in teaching you that, but again I think that is something that should be done before purchasing a beginner's DVD, because so many people learning an instrument can already do so. Foresman goes on to teach only the notes in the scale of C, and too much time is spent on play-along songs that go too fast. Playing along with a DVD, with notes appearing on the bottom of the screen, isn't a convenient method, and it would have been much better if Foresman had spent time teaching all the notes, i.e. sharps and flats, and about what the keys do, because he left a lot out and I ended up disappointed that I had just practised playing the same few notes over and over again.",1168041600,8,1254,4.358974358974359
