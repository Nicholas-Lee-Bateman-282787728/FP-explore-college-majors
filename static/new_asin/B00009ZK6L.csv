7994586,5,B00009ZK6L,"This is some of the most amazing footage of one of the worlds most deadliest forms of Karate.  I studied Uechi Ryu for about 2 years, as a teenager. It's lessons still serve me well. this is the real thing.",1369958400,,206,4.15
7994587,2,B00009ZK6L,"For students of Uechi Ryu you must understand that this video was filmed by a Uechi Ryu student but is currently not produced by one.  On the back of the video it clearly states ""He is performing the katas and training drills of the style.""  There are no Uechi Ryu training drills shown in this video by Kanei Uechi.  The video cuts out and resets after it has shown the three Uechi Ryu kata without any conclusion.  After my frustration on the dvd player, I went to my computer and played the video.  On my computer it continues after the kata to show modern Shorin Ryu students practicing drills and their own kata.  The person that made the dvd either intended on fooling all of us with these training drills as being part of Uechi Ryu in order to make the dvd longer.  Or they simply are so cheap that they taped over another karate video instead of paying .50 cents to buy a new dvd.

This video footage is only 3 Min of Kanei Uechi doing Sanchin, Seisan, and Sanseirui.  The rest of the Uechi Ryu video is repeated footage (the same kata from a different angle), and then the exact same footage in extremely slow motion. The amount of time actually showing Kanei Uechi is roughly 12 min.  The rest of the video is contemporary Shorin Ryu.

I believe that you do not get what you paid for.",1325376000,7,1294,4.35
7994588,5,B00009ZK6L,"I have been a student of Uechi Ryu since 1979,a fine style for those of short stature.

The previous review would have been more appropriate if it were in english.",1175558400,,163,4.433333333333334
7994589,5,B00009ZK6L,"Como gua histtrica, y por tener al Maestro Kanei Uechi realizando los katas y algunos de los movimientos importantes, este DVD es de mucho valor.

Hay otros productos no vendidos por Amazon, que tienen mejor calidad que este DVD, exponiendo casi el mismo contenido.",1168473600,3,265,5.0227272727272725
