5722238,5,B00CHKGWPI,"Eddie Izzard at his amazing best! We've been watching Eddie for years! He never disappoints! This new DVD, released in November, 2013, is outstanding!! He will make you laugh and learn!",1391299200,5,185,5.0
8581791,5,B00CHKGWPI,"Eddie Izzard is an incredibly talented performer.  I've been a fan since I chanced on Dress to Kill years ago.  We saw him in person in March 2017, which is 4 years after this show in London was recorded, but the current act was just as fresh as shown in this performance.  Force Majeure is very well crafted and each part is cleverly interwoven.  The filming effectively captured his physical moves and the audio was crystal clear.  Watching this show makes me again appreciate the preciseness and sophistication of his comedy,",1493596800,2,528,4.758241758241758

8581793,1,B00CHKGWPI,The ultraviolet redeem date had expired when I got it(11-18-15)!!!!!!  Money wasted---would like a refund. Thanks Toni Weber.,1479168000,2,125,5.944444444444445
8581794,3,B00CHKGWPI,"The show is awesome and is probably My favourite from Izzard, packaging is nice with a booklet and pictures - however nothing special there.
I was very disappointed to see that the code for the ultraviolet service that was accompanying this purchase expired last november and I could not redeem it",1469232000,,297,4.8431372549019605
8581795,5,B00CHKGWPI,It's Eddie. Of course it's great other wise you would not be reading this - just get it.,1463011200,,88,3.9444444444444446
8581796,1,B00CHKGWPI,This will not play on my dvd blue ray player it is for a Violet ray player. Never even knew they made them. You have to pay to ship it back to the UK for a refund. Haven't even bothered to look in to it. Therefore it sits on my shelf. Still love Eddie .,1443657600,,253,3.618181818181818
8581797,4,B00CHKGWPI,"Not his best concert. Eddie is pulled in other directions now, notably acting, but also politics and marathon running, so he recycles some of his best routines. But recycled Izzard is till one of the funniest comics ever",1442275200,,220,4.815789473684211
8581798,4,B00CHKGWPI,"Although the disc specifies non US region coding, I took the plunge and found that it works on my old Magnavox Bluray player. I can not vouch for other US machines, but my player has not been hacked to be region free.

As for the content - it's Eddie Izzard and he's great (maybe not vintage Izzard, but still bloody good.) Saw him in Las Vegas a few months ago.",1441756800,,362,4.171428571428572
