The movies should be :
1. Night Passage, 2. Death in Paradise, 3. Stone Cold, 4. Sea Change, 5. Thin Ice,6,No Remorse,7. Innocents Lost,8. Benefit of the Doubt.

5410105,5,B00AEB70V2,"Great series. I truly enjoy these movies. Selleck was meant to be Jesse Stone. I would not recommend watching them all at once as there is some repetition. They are, after all, an ongoing series with time gaps between when they were shown on TV. Another irksome point is the 8 movies are spread over 4 discs, not the 8 claimed in the online description, and are not in chronological based on release date. I really can't fathom why not as it's a bit of a pain to need to switch discs to watch them in order. I've also purchased the 9th movie. It's as good as the first 8. Hope Jesse sticks around for a while provided he can get away from ""Blue Bloods"".",1475798400,12,653,4.232

5410114,5,B00AEB70V2,"Tom Selleck has greatly matured since his high, squeaking-voiced Magnum, P.I. days. Although I liked him--who couldn't--now I love him. As Jesse Stone, and in a similar but alternate-universe sort of way in ""Blue Bloods,"" Mr. Selleck has mastered the subtleties of acting.
ALL of his performances I highly and strongly recommend :-)",1472860800,2,332,5.283018867924528

brightly sighing in every scene as if crying out to be put out of his pain for having to more be in more Jesse Stone films,
the classic DVD set we bought at the total cost of $65 + is faulty. The audio track falters at times which makes it
impossible to understand dialogue in numerous  places which leaves you wondering....how could a leading production
company lend it's name to this inferior product. So be prepared for this fans, because we weren't and would have passed by
this collection had we known. (sigh)",1470873600,5,620,4.636363636363637

5410158,5,B00AEB70V2,"If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.

Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work. Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her? Will he be able to stop drinking? Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job? Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?

In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.

In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real. Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease. You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself. The secondary characters are strong. You don't feel like you are watching a show. You feel like it's real life. And you care about the characters. Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.

This is the kind of series you could watch every year. Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode. Hallmark did this fall titled LOST IN PARADISE to be released on DVD January 26, 2016. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until then.

5410169,5,B00AEB70V2,"My father-in-law and I have a once a week ""movie night"". We had already watched the complete 8-series set of the Jesse Stone movies when I purchased another copy of the set for close friends. That should say it all, but please bear with me...
Our movie night now is one episode of Magnum, P.I. and one episode of China Beach. Granted, we are only in the first season of Magnum, but the plots are thin and Mr. Selleck's acting, to paraphrase Pauline Kael, runs from ""A to A"". Beefcake. (Though he is very good at that.)
Thank goodness for Jesse Stone which allows him to demonstrate his superior ability to act.
The stories are well-written. The casting, cinematography and acting beyond superb.

My heart ""soared like an eagle"" when I heard a new Jesse Stone was in production. I hope Mr. Selleck continues to make one every year.",1435881600,14,830,4.570469798657718

5410246,5,B00AEB70V2,"While I am still waiting to receive the last movie I purchased here on Amazon, with the addition of the two I own on Instant Stream in my movie library, I also own all the rest of the series on DVD. I have seen all 8 of the Jesse Stone movies on Netflix and the Hallmark Channel on cable TV. The picture clarity of the DVD's are far superb to what I've seen on cable. The first thing that appeals to me about this series is of course that it stars Tom Selleck , who currently stars in the CBS series ""Blue Bloods"" which in recent months has completed it's third season and has been renewed to begin it's fourth season on Friday nights this fall and another long running CBS-TV series which most of his fans are familiar with ""Magnum PI"". Selleck has also starred in several films for the big screen ""Three Men and a Baby"", the sequel ""Three Men and a Little Lady"", ""Runaway"", and ""Her Alibi"" to name a few. Selleck not only stars in the Jesse Stone movies as the central character, he is also the producer so consequently these movies have top notch casting and the performances are excellent. In particular Viola Davis who I've seen on numerous ""Law and Order"" episodes playing one of those defense attorneys we all love to hate but here she is cast in a much more likable character as Molly and is part of the Paradise Police department. She forms quite an attachment to the Jesse, the Chief of Police, and provides good moral support when appropriate. I love the scene where she goes into the boys restroom at the local high school after one of three gang rapists of a fellow female student, the way she apprehends the teen is priceless. He is one of those kids of upper society families in Paradise and thinks he doesn't have to pay attention to any authority type. The boys father is just as bad and another great scene is when the father insults the rape victim at the police station in front of Jesse and the victims father, the victims father jumps up and punches out the teen for insulting his daughter and when the boys father attempts to confront the victims father he also proceeds to punch him out and next you see him taking on both the obnoxious father and son...then at the right moment Jesse Stone calms the girls dad down and has him take a seat. When the dad of the boy starts to yell about getting his lawyer and having the other dad charged with assaulting him and his son, when he tells Jesse he is a witness for his assault case, Jesse sides the victom and her dad and the teen rapist is put in a holding cell. Jesse Stone was hired by the town council for Paradise and in a meeting they tell him that he could be better utilizing his people and resources to solve a series of mysterious shootings. When Jesse tells them he's been a cop for a number of years and knows how to work the case, the council implies they can fire him. Jesse's reply, ""you can fire me but you can't tell me what to do."" It's not long before Jesse knows who is responsible for committing the murders including his pal, a lawyer for the DA, now he must gather the evidence needed to apprehend the killers. ""Stone Cold"" is a very taught, well written, and acted story and Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone doesn't miss a mark. This movie as with all the movies in this series keep your interest from beginning to end. There are many other excellent actors in the series. I have never read the books but after watching this series I just might have to read the books...books usually have far more detail than what you see in the finished movie. Tom Selleck is excellent as Jesse Stone. I had so hoped that we would see another movie added to the series but perhaps the last movie ""Benefit Of The Doubt"" is the end or maybe Tom Selleck felt he wasn't able to squeeze in the time to shoot another movie with his busy schedule doing""Blue Bloods"". In any case these are movies that I like to pull out and will watch again and again over time. Each time you see these movies you see something new that you missed the time before. Jesse Stone is a very comfortable character for Tom Selleck and Tom Selleck is very comfortable in the role of Jesse Stone. These movies made for CBS-TV are all top quality and a definite must see if you like crime drama's and especially if you are a fan of Tom Selleck. Something added with the DVD that you won't see on any of the pay services on the DVD ""Stone Cold"" there is a featurette ""Beneath the Surface of ""Stone Cold"" which gives some interesting background on the making of the first movie in the series and the cast that appears in this excellent movie.",1404777600,,4580,4.339160839160839

5410248,1,B00AEB70V2,"My Mom asked me to look into buying these for her.  She is 67 years old and has no understanding of buying online.  After looking up the movies on Wikipedia, I got the list of available films.  I then came to Amazon to research prices.  Turns out you can buy these individually for less than this movie collection.  Don't know if this collection comes with any specials or extras, but not worth the extra $55 for us.

I actually found a collection of 5 of the movies for $39.95 and then bought the other 3 separate for only $68 compared to the asking price here of $139....",1403568000,4,573,4.308411214953271
5410249,5,B00AEB70V2,"Jesse Stone is the best! Tom Selleck is at his understated best as Jesse Stone. Every one of these stories is gripping and intense, while the acting is superb. Couldn't have a better cast...they ARE these people. The theme music is haunting and just right to introduce the setting of Paradise Cove, the small Massachusetts coastal village where Tom Selleck is the Police Chief. As Jesse Stone, this is one of the best characters he's ever played. I've always liked him in anything he did, but something about his Jesse Stone just seams so REAL. He's a melancholy sort, but a good man with some serious problems who is trying to do good (not always succeeding), but everyone who knows him knows he's an honest, fair, compassionate man and one heck of a cop. I think it's his best character to date, including the TV series character Frank Reagan in Blue Bloods, which I also love. Hopefully, (and according to Mr. Selleck), there are plans to produce more episodes soon. I can't wait! You won't be disappointed with this collection and will find yourself watching it over and over. EXCELLENT COLLECTION! Fast Shipping & Well packaged.",1403308800,3,1133,4.785714285714286
5410250,5,B00AEB70V2,"Anyone that has watched ANY of the ""Jesse Stone"" movies can tell you..... There's just SOMETHING about them that draws you in! For me, its a combination of the WONDERFUL acting of Tom Selleck, combined with his cast of of GREAT ""Character Actors"" like Kathy Baker and Kohl Suddath, along with the awesome scenery of ""Paradise"" (Nova Scotia is where it was actually filmed) and the plot and story lines makes these movies a JOY to watch over and over and OVER again! I don't know what it is about small,coastal towns, but just LOVE movies and TV shows that take place in them! Something ""soothing"" about it to me.. But anyway, lol (rambling) I just ordered this 8 movie set so I CAN watch my Jesse Stone movies whenever and Whereever I want to!
Sure hope they make a #9 soon!!! Selleck SAID he is not opposed to it as long as he has the time and it doesn't interfere with Blue Bloods!

5410259,5,B00AEB70V2,"The Best in todays TV movies is this series
with that said here is a very good job of acting
I do hope that Tom Selleck makes more movies of Jesse Stone.
His writing is great also.
the way to watch these movies is listed below
2006: Night Passage
2005: Stone Cold
2006: Death In Paradise
2007: Sea Change
2009: Thin Ice
2010: No Remorse

5410265,5,B00AEB70V2,These movies are sort of film noire genre detective.  The flawed character of Jessie Stone is handled well by Tome Selleck.  There is an overarching sense of sorrow from all the characters that makes this different from many other detective series.  We enjoyed the entire series.,1388707200,,279,5.021739130434782

5410268,3,B00AEB70V2,"DAY-1

First, I really like the movies... But:
1. There is nothing that specifies the order each movie was made. I'm assuming ""Stone Cold"" was the first (because it is the first one pictured and has the lowest catalog number).

O.K., so which episode has the town council hiring Jesse because they think he is a screw up?  Shouldn't this be the first one or is there a pilot episode which was not included?
I'm confused (but have only watched ""Stone Cold"" thus far).

2. These movies are special to me.  I would have thought Mr. Selleck would understand this about Jesse Stone fans.
You know, with the ""Nikon"" natural lighting and the heart-string tugging music and all, this package should have been simple and natural.  Unfortunately, the studio weasels (including Mr. Selleck?) managed to insert some cheap-assed make a few extra buck ""Previews"" and warnings (in three languages) to ""not copy what you have already purchased"".

Bummed me clean out...

DAY-2

I watched the next movie (based on catalog numbers) ""Night Passage"".  THIS is (or at least should be) the first in the Jesse Stone series.  It explains how he is recruited and hired by the Paradise Town Council.  ""Stone Cold"" has a lower catalog number (remember, no guide is provided with this collection) but should not be watched first.",1384819200,4,1301,4.83710407239819

5410277,5,B00AEB70V2,"I love the characters and stories that Robert Parker wove together in this series of Jesse Stone stories. The film quality alone is rich and clear and displays many beautiful shots of this small northeast harbor town. These are not hard, fast, or noisy shoot em up type of murder mysteries. They move slowly in order to allow ample time to develop both the characters and the plot. Often there is more than one plot being developed in one episode. I first learned of these on Roku streaming and instantly fell in love with the characters and stories. Parker portrays Jesse Stone (played by Tom Selleck) as a clearly flawed character with alcohol issues and an ex-wife he can't seem to move on from. But he is a great cop and as he often said, he is more concerned with justice than he is with conviction which leads him into some rather unorthodox but effective means to an end when it comes to catching the bad guy/gal.",1377302400,,920,4.514970059880239

We like movies where the language and sex are not over done.  With the Jesse Stone series, there is some reality of life.  There is love, heartbreak, humor, mystery, compassion, true friendship, companionship, and the dog often steals the show.  We watched a few as rentals, then decided the collection was something that we wanted to own and have watched all episodes many times and can't wait for the next one to be released.
