7863406,5,6304023235,"I love this video. I laugh out loud whenever I watch it. When it was new, it was great, but now that it is a bit dated I consider it a classic. Some of the best and funniest comedians can be found including people I never knew did stand up. Besides Billy, Whoopi, and Robin there's also Chris Rock, Paula Poundstone, Drew Carey, Bobby Slayton, Margaret Cho, Paul Rodriguez, Bob Saget, and a ton of others that I'm leaving out. Don't miss this video!",1159574400,2,449,4.357142857142857
