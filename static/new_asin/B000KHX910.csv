This is a really good dvd EXCEPT LAP DANCE is very graphic (nudness & foreplay scenes), & dem suga DOES NOT feature Pharrell. i rated this dvd a 5 (EXCELLENT)vbut this is NOT for MINOR CHILDREN, has explicit language & sexual scenes.",1283299200,,709,4.634920634920635
8431035,1,B000KHX910,"I ordered this for my daughter who loves Pharell, but wish I hadn't.  The DVD was just a bunch of grainy looking recorded videos, transferred to a DVD. It didn't even include all of the songs listed on the cover. Even my daughter didn't want to finish this mess. Don't waste your money.",1265241600,,286,4.39622641509434
