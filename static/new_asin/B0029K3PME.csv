3876893,5,B0029K3PME,"Leaving Barstow does absolutely nothing particularly flashy. I mean, it's not a film stacked with special effects, wild storyline twists, or anything of that nature. Instead, what makes Leaving Barstow succeed is the fact it tells such a simple, likeable story.

In fact, another reason the movie is so great is the way many of us can probably relate to the young teenager who plays the main character.

He desperately wants to leave home (and town altogether) but the love he has for his mother and his friends (and a girl he meets at a restaurant where his mother works) makes leaving a VERY difficult decision. How many of us were in the same situation at some point in time? Most of us were.

My favorite part of the storyline are the scenes showing the teenager trying to deal with his mothers new boyfriend.  The boyfriend is seriously only a few years older than the mothers son, haha.  This means the son has a serious problem with him and constantly questions his every move.

Anyway, the atmosphere is exceptionally quiet and the storyline is definitely on the simple and straightforward side, but none of that interferes with the amount of enjoyment this movie supplies to the viewers. You will understand every single event that takes place (well, except maybe the part dealing with the school teacher who suddenly dies- I think this part of the story could have given us more because I was curious what really happened there).

Anyway, the acting is solid, the storyline is enjoyable, and the film just works. I like it.",1277251200,,1533,4.7406015037593985
3876894,5,B0029K3PME,"When I finished watching Leaving Barstow for the first time all I wanted to say to everyone involved in the film was.........Thank You.  And then I went off to find a box of Kleenex.

The story of a boy, Andrew, with bigger dreams stuck in a small town trying to find the strength to go, may seem all too familiar to some, but that does not mean that this film feels old or tired or off-putting in anyway.  Quite the contrary.  First time writer and star of the film Kevin Sheridan has put together a script and a performance with quiet heart.  (Only about 25 when he did this, he is definitely one to keep an eye on)  Michele Clunie infuses Andrew's mother Sandra with characteristics that make the audience both loathe and feel sorry for her at the same time, aptly showing us where the core of Andrew's struggle to stay or go lies.  And Peter Paige's direction depicts Barstow as washed out and lifeless while at the same time he keeping his actors in sharp but quite focus, thus allowing them to shine and be the true center of this lovely little character driven piece.

So, after viewing the film a second and a third time, I would still like to say ""thank you"" to everyone involved with this film for proving that a great film comes from the heart and not necessarily from the size of your production and marketing budget.

This had a great run on the festival circuit over the last year, but sadly remained mostly an undiscovered, indie gem.  Well worth your time and money to discover it for yourself.",1251936000,26,1510,4.438405797101449

3876899,4,B0029K3PME,"It seemed like the story of many young people who don't fit in but who have bigger dreams.  The main character is  in high school and quite intelligent, but socially awkward. His mother depends on him a lot and they are close.  They don't  have money and he wants to go to college, but he feels like he has to be there for his mother.  The landscape is flat, dry and barren and rather depressing.  It reminded me of so many little towns in West Texas.  His father is dead and his mom works as a waitress but she is lonely and pursues affairs with a few guys including one who is a 22 year old musician.

3876943,4,B0029K3PME,"I chose this movie for its indie festival tour.  Then, I look for the intended meandering pace to match what my mood desired.  If your mood wishes for something uplifting or edgy action, this isn't the one.  Take the time however, you will find solace in the the main character in this movie, Andrew, as he leads a meager existence with his young, irresponsible Mom in Barstow, CA. But Andrew finds patience by focusing on finishing his final days of high school.  His one true buddy, Carlos, rides the city bus with him each day to go to school.  Although most of the movie takes place outside of school, the characters all seem to evoke a common worry that life in Barstow will derail ones dreams.  Carlos and Andrew have dreams of college acceptance letters when even a pitiful teachers encouragement for them comes from depressing self-disclosure.  Andrew is played by the writer, Kevin Sheridan, who did a convincing job keeping the tone low and the pace slow, but with enough side plot interest to move me into understanding how Andrew's circumstances would not keep him down.",1392768000,,1082,4.754010695187166

3876946,5,B0029K3PME,"I was amazed to learn that this great character study was written by lead actor Kevin Sheridan.  It portrays the story of an 18 year old finishing up his senior year of high school, and his mother. Andrew (played by Kevin Sheridan) is a very bright 18 year old senior who threw away his application to a big name university (I think it was Harvard) out of a sense of loyalty to his mother, a waitress who has a hard time paying the rent or filling the fridge, but who spends a lot of time with her new boyfriend, who is only 4 years older than her son.  He plans instead to go to the city college.

One of the overriding themes in the movie is that of people feeling ""trapped"" by having given up on their dreams and remaining in Barstow, a dusty, desert town miles from anywhere along the highway Vegas and LA.  He and his best friend Carlos had been planning together their escape through acceptance at a good college.

Andrew is faced with resigning himself to staying and helping out his mother, and going to city college, or getting up the courage to follow his own dreams.",1389571200,2,1077,4.338308457711443

3876949,3,B0029K3PME,"I've seen worse. :)

The movie isn't really all that novel. Classic ""kid in a dead-end town"" story. But it's done with thoughtfulness and decent characterization. The acting's pretty good too.

I didn't like the technical aspects so much, but not so much that I feel like it affects the rating. Seems like in every shot, something's out of focus, sometimes the whole shot. Yeah, I get it...use depth-of-field to convey or soft-pedal (depending) the point of interest in the shot. I'm sure there's even a name for it in Hollywood. But for the whole movie? I also got pretty bored with the musical montages, particularly ironic considering the movie soundtrack isn't even available for sale (which seems like the usual reason directors stick a bunch of lengthy music-backed segments into the movie).

So, be prepared for a bit of cliched technique in your movie. But other than that, it's a fine diversion for 90 minutes. Watching Andrew work his way out of his rut is satisfying. There's a great relationship between him and his best friend Carlos; it's fun to see how much they care about each other. And the conversations with the late-night radio host are convincing and entertaining. There's some other good stuff in the movie too. :)",1385078400,6,1237,4.8530805687203795

3876955,3,B0029K3PME,"Every now and then I come across a gem of a movie by pure accident. I was just searching through the schedule for Showtime on TV earlier this week and ran across this movie. I read the short synopsis and decided to record it. After watching it tonight, I'm surprised at how good the film was. Leaving Barstow (2008) is an indie written by young actor Kevin Sheridan and directed by actor Peter Paige. I think what's so appealing about this movie is how low key the production is. It looks and feels like everyday life in a small crappy town like Barstow. But the movie is very well written, acted and photographed. So while it may look like a low budget indie, it doesn't have the often times lame story and acting of a low budget movie.

The story is simply about this 18-year old guy named Andrew who is finishing high school in a dead end town. He's living with his widowed mother Sandra, who's dating a 22-year old country-rock singer named Cody. There's obviously some tension between Andrew and Cody since Cody is only a few years older than Andrew and he's sleeping with Andrew's mother...on the other side of Andrew's bedroom wall. But the real story here is Andrew figuring out what he wants to do with his life. Does he stay in this nowhere town and keep his lonely mother company? Or does he leave for college and start a new life for himself?

Actor Steven Culp, who I absolutely loved in Thirteen Days (2000), plays one of Andrew's high school teachers. It's a small supporting role, but he packs a punch with his few minutes on screen. This film was obviously overlooked and poorly distributed when it came out two years ago. But I'm certainly glad to have discovered it on Showtime this week. If you like character-driven dramas, then check this film out on Showtime or DVD. I think we can all relate to the characters in this movie from some period in our lives. The photography was well done, with some cool compositions...even though there seemed to be a lot of ""ass"" shots and blurry montages. I give the film 3 out of 5 stars. It's a good late night flick.",1286236800,,2076,4.474934036939314

The minimalist. music is oddly fitting and touching.
I've been through places like Barstow many times and I can relate to the location. Towns like this reek of thoughtless despair and hollow resignation. A gray, greasy, dishwater existence in the midst of smoky diesel fumes and suffocating dust.
No one gives a second thought to the landscape: The ugly skeletons of endless iron security bars laden with attacking rust and the unstoppable peeling of cheap paint and even cheaper application.
Most folks passing through fill up with regular, grab a fast food combo and disappear into the hazy sunset, glad to be leaving and in no hurry to return.
This is a town stuck in endless dusk with little hope for daybreak  and the director knew precisely how to capture these sentiments.
One viewing on IFC and I had to own a copy. Well worth revisiting those shades of misty gray.
Hollywood films gives us escapism.
Indy films show us what we are escaping from.
This is a movie made on a shoestring budget that has some true meaning. It's void of Hollywood trappings. Real life told with a heart.

8357821,5,B0029K3PME,"This was a surprisingly good film.  The characters, played expertly by mostly little-known actors, were ordinary people caught up in the drudgery of daily life with no apparent future dreams that could drive them.  The story centers around Andrew (Kevin Sheridan) who is a very bright high school senior who has chosen to forgo a college scholarship to stay in his dismal home to look after his flake of a mother, Sandra (Michelle Clunie).  Sandra is still a young woman looking for romance and seemingly finding it in Cody (the gorgeous Ryan Carnes) who is only 4 years older than Andrew.  Andrew stumbles into an uplifting and hopeful relationship with Jenny (the stunning Ryan Michelle Bathe), a coworker with Andrew's mother at the Chinese restaurant. I don't want to say much more about the story line since it unfolds in a surprising and ultimately uplifting manner. I do want to give a shout-out to Steven Culp who plays Andrew's high school teacher and mentor, Mr. Johns.
