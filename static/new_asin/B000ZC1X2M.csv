8235366,3,B000ZC1X2M,"Did have some funny stuff in it.  Also had a lot of repeats throughout it.  Plus it had clips that not only weren't funny, they didn't even make any sense.",1355097600,,155,4.133333333333334
8235367,1,B000ZC1X2M,"This DVD was apparenetly copied from a VCR tape and it was recorded from the Television.  It is really a junk disk.

The copy is so poor you can't hear most of the dialogue, the video is poor, sometimes jerky, sometimes it looks like a movie from the 1920's with all the streaks in the video.  I filed it in the circular file.  I do not fault the vendor - -it is just the nature of the beast.  Had I contacted the vendor there is nothing they could have done except perhaps offer me a refund, but that would have punished the vendor for something totally out of his control.  I have ordered from the vendor in the past and will again in the future.",1344384000,4,648,4.144
8235368,2,B000ZC1X2M,"If you can get this really cheap, pick it up. Otherwise, save your money. The problem with this DVD is, they may be bloopers, but they're not uncensored. Whenever someone swears, it's covered by a bleep! Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of this collection? Shame too, because the Laugh-In and Star Trek bloopers are a lot of fun. Just not in this DVD. And yes, Bonanza bloopers can not be found. At least, I didn't see any.",1244505600,6,430,4.455696202531645
8235369,4,B000ZC1X2M,"CLASSIC TELEVISION: BLOOPER BONANZA 1960s includes bloopers from the 1960s TV series ""Star Trek,"" ""McHale's Navy,"" and ""Laugh-In,"" each running about 15 to 20 minutes. About 15 years ago I bought at a science fiction convention a videotape of ""Star Trek"" extras, including hilarious bloopers from the original series. This is very similar to the bloopers on my videotape, including the length of about 15 minutes, but there are some differences here. Editing is a little different, and oddly this one is censored, whereas my videotape version was not. When someone says a curse word it's bleeped out, which is frustrating since you often can't tell what the person said. Since these bloopers have usually been shown at conventions and available for private purchase and NOT shown on TV, why were they censored here? Much of what's funny about bloopers is that people said and did things that could not be shown on TV, so in my opinion it's too bad that the uncensored version was not put on this DVD. I would have dropped my rating to 3 stars because of this, but decided not to because as far as I know this is the only place that these are legally available. Also, the picture and sound quality are still terrible here as they were on my videotape, although from what I've heard about their origin I'd say that there's probably not much choice there. I should note that some of the ""Star Trek"" bloopers are only fully understandable if you know a lot about the background of the show, but they're still funny even if you don't know those things. Perhaps optional subtitles should have been added to explain some of this.

The ""McHale's Navy"" and ""Laugh-In"" bloopers are also very enjoyable although sometimes raucous, and with a little better picture quality than the ""Star Trek"" bloopers. I don't mean to minimize them, it's just that I know a lot more about the ""Star Trek"" ones. And I should note that despite the title of this DVD, there are NO bloopers from ""Bonanza"" here. Well, someone MIGHT think there were!",1228003200,3,2018,4.732954545454546
8235370,3,B000ZC1X2M,"If you're looking for an excellent restore and production values of today, this is not for you.  However, if you love these old TV shows and are willing to look past some truly amateurish editing, some general silliness, poor video and audio quality, this is worth a look.",1212969600,3,272,4.666666666666667
8235371,5,B000ZC1X2M,This DVD features classic television bloopers from 1960's Star Trek. Quite funny for a Trekkie fan out there. Also features other bloopers from 60's TV shows McHale's Navy and Laugh-In.,1196985600,5,185,5.2
