8009188,5,B0001AFNVU,"I admit that I have not seen this film since it was playing in theaters but I do remember at least some bits that I dearly which I could revisit on DVD. In particular, Mike Hailwood on a TZ750 blowing by some guy in the fog at the top of the hill on the Isle of Man.",1324684800,,266,3.6842105263157894
8009189,2,B0001AFNVU,"Save your money.  This movie is not made well at all.  Filmed so dark in many places, you can not see who's talking. There is a real reason the film did not make the big time. To compare this film to ""On any Sunday"" would be like comparing drum to disc brakes. Very poorly done. Waste of time.  Go ride.",1294963200,,303,4.016666666666667
8009190,5,B0001AFNVU,"This is the only motorcycle video in the same league as the original ""On Any Sunday"" video. I only wish it was available in DVD format. I've checked everywhere in the world for it, but no-go.

Few people outside of motorcycle enthuiasts know about Steve Baker and what he did for motorcycling. He was a true pioneer in GP Road Racing. He was the first American to win a road racing world championship, when in 1977 he won the Formula 750 Title. This video highlights Steve's career.

If you get the chance to watch this video - DO IT!",1239926400,9,534,4.383838383838384
