899088,5,6304563795,"Who'd've thought that a nun, a woman dedicated to a life of religion and chastity and serving the church would have such an insight on the sexual content of works of art?  Well, that sounds a bit ignorant on my part, but Sister Wendy does do an excellent job at giving us a guided tour and commentary of some of history's most beloved and admired works of art.  Some works are not included in art history books used by educational institutes and some are so discussed that the viewer can almost take pride in hearing that Sister Wendy shares their opinion.  This is a great collection to add to any art education/art history curriculum (high school/college and edited versions for middle school).",1002844800,10,696,4.688524590163935
899089,5,6304563795,"I use this set as part of my beginning art history classes.  People like to make fun of Sister Wendy and they are less likely to make fun of the art.  The fact that she is not a bit shy about pointing out the sexual nature of many of the pieces gets students on her side after awhile.  Sister Wendy gives a good comprehensive overview and, although I don't always agree with her, she sets up great conversations in class.  Video is a great way to get students to enjoy art--far better in my opinion than the endless parade of slides we had to endure.",1001635200,11,550,4.20952380952381
899090,5,6304563795,"This is a great introduction to the appreciation of western art.  Sister Wendy's passion for art is contagious.  She gives us new eyes to see.  The one big regret is that with such a wide scope to cover, she could only be  rather cursory in her comments.  I would love to watch her commenting in  greater depth on some selected paintings, like the 100 Great Paintings  series or even devote a whole hour to each painting, like Vision on  Art--Jan van Eyck -- one of the best videos on art that I've seen.",956793600,14,504,4.344086021505376
899091,5,6304563795,"These series are a surrealist masterpiece in their own right! Who would have imagined a sweet old Catholic nun describing 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon' with such passion and expertise!  Sister Wendy deserved to be  painted by Andy Warhol as a pop-art icon!
Not that the BBC programs are  flawless, mind you: Velzquez, for instance, is not as thoroughly analized  as, say, Turner, although he's a far superior artist, if not the greatest  of them all. And, due to the scope it tries to cover, the show I think  merely gives a somewhat simplistic overview of its infinitely much richer  subject. But hey, let's not forget this is TV, and as such, this is the  best ever made on this matter!
If I were you, I'd buy both the box and  the book. What a match made in Heaven!",954633600,6,766,4.532846715328467
899092,5,6304563795,"i own each of the videos in the series, and i find sister wendy's criticisms culturally relevant and interesting.  the editing with sister wendy floating amongst the works of art is quite funny (intentionally).  i  used them with advanced students, and once they stopped laughing and  listened, they worked well.",939254400,8,312,5.18
7874200,5,6304563795,"I am taking an art class that is based on Sister Wendy's book, The Story of Painting, so the documentary series is the perfect companion to the book.  It is delightful to see Sister Wendy in action.",1442275200,,198,4.351351351351352

7874205,3,6304563795,"Sister Wendy has a slight lisp with an English accent.
There is no doubt that she has been to the places and seen the
paintings, but she has a sort of strange angle of attack
on the female in art that she brings to her
lectures? From cave are to 1400 A.D.
she covers specific examples of Greek, Roman and Egyptian art.
I liked the art and the color close-ups, but sometimes didn't
appreciate her interpretations.",1249084800,,412,4.434210526315789
7874206,5,6304563795,"If you have any interest in art history, this quick 5 hour tour de force provides a great overview.  I bought this at a NPR video sale and wasn't exactly sure what I was getting.  I started watching it one evening and found Sister Wendy to have all the attributes and humanity of my best and most admired college professors.  It's something I will no doubt watch again and again.  Beautifully done.",1235001600,3,398,4.486111111111111
7874207,5,6304563795,"I only used the first video in the collection with my students, but they really liked it.  Sister Wendy is facinating to them because of her looks and sarcasm.  (Most of my students were inner city kids)  They loved.  I do advise that you view it first, since in the last 3 minutes of the video she shows a Limborg brothers work that the men have no underpants (although they look like cow udders!  Not appropriate for kids.)  I just cut it off there when they were watching.  They always begged me to see what it was.  I even had a couple of kids who checked it out from the public library to see it. They said it was no big deal and we should have just watched it...",1226620800,2,668,4.124031007751938
7874208,4,6304563795,"...because this is one quick story! Is it wrong to think that five hours isn't enough time for so lengthy a subject? In this case, it didn't seem like enough, but I understand that the producers had to stop somewhere.

Sister Wendy does a masterful job of showing you things in art you might not see otherwise. Her passion is alive and real, and she doesn't hesitate to show the viewer exactly what she sees. And the topics aren't muted because she's a nun - whether it is love or hate or sex or suicide - doesn't matter to Sister Wendy. She tackles them all. Not only does she explain various masterpieces of art, she also tells you about the artists that made them, and why.

Sadly, though, there is so much to cover and so little time. Because of this Sister Wendy is only able to spend a few minutes on any given artist - whether it is da Vinci or Monet, they all get the same treatment. And although it is understandable, for there is a lot of ground to cover, it left me wanting more - like I hadn't seen it all (and indeed I hadn't).

To adequately cover this material Sister Wendy would probably have to produce a 10 or 15 hour documentary. But again, there's only so much you can cover. In view of that, Sister Wendy has done as good a job as any!

Four stars.",1124841600,,1269,4.231404958677686
7874209,5,6304563795,"Prior to encountering Sr. Wendy, I liked art.  Through Sr. Wendy, I have come to love it.  One might first be struck by her rather odd appearance -- she is a rather frumpy nun.  But the second thing one notices, and what one is ultimately swept up by, is her passion for art.
She approaches art as a lover, rather than as a critic.  Yes, she is willing to make judgments about what she likes and what she doesn't like.  But one has the impression that she approaches all art expecting to be pleased.  That attitude makes her willing to *look* at the art with her whole being.  And in that open act of looking, she sees a lot.  She has the further gift of being able to clearly articulate what she has seen.
In this series of videos, Sr. Wendy takes us through the history of art, from the pre-historical art of the caves in France to the modern art galleries in New York today.  She allows us to see how art developed, and she sets these developments in their historical context.  Nonetheless, the heart of these videos and the secret to Sr. Wendy's success is her ability to see these great works afresh, almost with the eyes of a child.  Some of the paintings evoke her delight, others her reverent awe.  She has thought about why the paintings elicit these responses, but without losing that primary response.  We can't help but be swept up in her enthusiasm.
I've watched these videos several times, and they never get stale.  If only they'd be re-issued as DVD's!  If you want to know why some people make such a fuss about fine art - these videos are a great place to start.  But be warned, you might find yourself suddenly planning your vacations around art museums!",1025827200,15,1673,4.436065573770492
