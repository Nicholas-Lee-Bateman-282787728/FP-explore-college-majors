8450288,4,B004ZMBKOY,"Sarah Miles won the best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival for this and she is quite effective. Cyril Cusack adds some class (in acting terms) as her father and a very young Julian Glover athletically plays the object of Sarah's desires.
A downbeat film enlivened by the cast. Still worth watching. Bleak Irish coastal scenery adds to the mood which never lifts for long.",1408233600,,379,4.757575757575758
8450289,4,B004ZMBKOY,"In the spirit of the arguably superior 'Girl with Green Eyes' (UK, 1964, 4 stars), also directed by Desmond Davis, and descended from more famous works of proto-feminist fiction, such as Ibsen's 'A Doll's House' and Lewis's 'Main Street,' 'I Was Happy Here' (UK, 1966, aka 'Time Lost and Time Remembered') is a thoughtfully written, earnestly acted man-tries-to-own-girl morality piece with a few class-oriented kitchen-sink elements sprinkled in and done with a hint of experimental, New Wave-influenced filmmaking.  There isn't anything groundbreaking here either intellectually or emotionally, but the script's sense of humanity and introspection and its cool evenhandedness in assigning blame to both sexes for their too-often tragically self-serving agendas distinguishes IWHH from many of its contemporaries with similar themes.  VCI's presentation is mainly good, offering a relatively clean b&w picture (1.33:1), although on my copy I encountered a number of random audio sputters that may be the result of a defective disc rather than a problem with the source recording.  3 1/2 stars overall.",1398816000,,1102,5.626506024096385
8450290,5,B004ZMBKOY,"This 1965 British film, set in Country Clare, Ireland, and London, is a coming-of-age story which, though firmly set in the values and attitudes of its day, attains a timeless quality by virtue of an intelligent, fluent script and fine ensemble playing by a top-notch cast. Sarah Miles plays the girl who leaves an Irish fishing village for London, hoping to be joined by her boyfriend, but, desperately lonely, ends up meeting a budding doctor. The story, which I won't spoil by going into more detail, is simple and universal. Anyone who has been in love can relate to it. The film-making shows distinct influences of the French 'New Wave' but uses these techniques judiciously and is creative in its own right. The score by William Alwyn is highly effective and the black-and-white photography lovingly captures the magnificent sky and seascapes of the Irish coast. It is a quiet, almost contemplative film, that uses flashbacks extensively. The weaving of these time transitions is very good, on the whole, but audiences that prefer a linear narrative and buckets of action are not likely to be satisfied. For me, I rate the film highly because I know I already want to watch it again.",1331424000,10,1189,4.891089108910891
8450291,4,B004ZMBKOY,"VCI Entertainment and Partisan Productions presents ""I WAS HAPPY HERE"" (aka: Time Lost and Time Remembered) (1966) (92 min/B&W) -- Starring  Sarah Miles, Cyril Cusack, Sean Caffrey & Julian Glover

Directed by Desmond Davis

Another great film from the British Invasion released by VCI.

Told in flashbacks with glorious black and white photography which gives this hints of films from the '40s.

An Irish woman (Sarah Miles) moves to London and marries an older man (Julian Glover).  Miles at her best, a well-mannered free spirit, wanderer type, who after a fight with her conservative, upper-crust husband, returns to the sleepy, old Irish seaside township of her birth.  And trouble brews when she rekindles an old flame, who is now engaged to another.

Director Desmond Davis, who also wrote the screenplay gives this an artistic nature of story telling. Wonderful close ups, good scenes with the cars and bicycles, which is so prevalent in other British films in the early 60's, but this hits the spot within the texture of good cinematography.
