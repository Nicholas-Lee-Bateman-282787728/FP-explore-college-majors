But parts of Don Qichote himself were just of poor singing. The Guy just could not make it! And never even bothered to try.
Music is very much like Rameau. That is very enjoyable. Otherwise the performance leaves much to be desired.
A CD recorded 20 years before by the same Mr. Niquet Herve en Concert is much more enjoyable.
And yes, there were an attempt to make some jazz out of it... wasted!
Don Qichote by Mr. Cervantes Saavedra was a parody on Chivalric romances. Mr. Bodin de Boismortier made a parody over that parody.
While this attempt of Mr. Niquet is like the third derivative of a parody - with little left of anything...",1504915200,,878,4.528301886792453
