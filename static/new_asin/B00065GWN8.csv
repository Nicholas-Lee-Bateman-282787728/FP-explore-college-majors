2169459,4,B00065GWN8,"This DVD is well worth the price and the 2003 tournament was the last before the WSOP got out of control.  Good to watch Chan, Ivey, Hellmuth, Farha, Harrington, Lederer, Nguyen etc.  Would have been nice to see some more extra features but you can't complain about the ESPN coverage.

Good to see Moneymaker win it.  Not an out and out champion like Ivey etc, but a good solid poker player nonetheless. Seems like a good bloke too.  Rather have a beer with him than Jamie Gold!!",1168473600,4,479,4.459770114942529
2169460,5,B00065GWN8,"Well it's poker. If you like it, then you're gonna love this DVD-Set. It's got all 7 episodes of the WSOP Main Event (probably don't need to tell you, 10thousand dollar NL Hold'em) tournament coverage, plus 3 extras. One of them an interview with the 2003 WSOP Main Event winner Chris Moneymaker. This DVD brings you great entertainment, starring legends as Chan, Hellmuth, Scotty Nguyen. And see some ""rookies"" like Chris Moneymaker, Tomer Benvenisti and others upset some of these legends. Some of it, certainly, luck; but also a lot of skill. And last but not least: The bluff of the century.",1153872000,2,595,4.8431372549019605
2169461,5,B00065GWN8,"The WSOP DVD's are just like watching it on ESPN, except without the commercials.  Very Satisfied.",1151452800,2,98,5.125
2169462,5,B00065GWN8,watching these disc i was struck by how much drama and comedy that there is in poker. this is also a very cheap way to learn about the game and what it takes to play with the big boys. i have watched this once and will watch it again.,1147046400,5,234,3.795918367346939
2169463,5,B00065GWN8,"This is an excellent set of DVD's featuring fun action by the top name stars. The episode featuring Sam Grizzle busting Phil Hellmuth's stones is worth the price alone.

As a special bonus, I don't think there is ANY footage of Mike ""The Mouth"" Matusow.",1135728000,3,253,4.622222222222222
2169464,5,B00065GWN8,"I know some guys have asked me before why I waste my time watching poker on television.  I've explained to them that observing the action, and getting to see the cards that are played and raised, actually makes me a better player.  It's as if you're given several hours of practice hands to learn from.  For your average Joe, seeing the way in which the game changes when the table is small is very helpful.  Ordinarily, I would be too conservative to play the types of cards necessary to win at a 4, 5 or 6 person table.  You have to take chances and gamble which is exactly what Farha and Moneymaker do throughout these 7 episodes.  I also like the fact that, unlike when you see them on television, there are not any commercials here to distract and annoy.  You can speed right through the discs.  I got my copy used and definitely will be watching WSOP 2003 a few more times.",1120435200,13,879,4.3496932515337425
2169465,5,B00065GWN8,"Unlike others that did not like this DVD, I highly reccomend it. Owning a dvd allows you the freedom to watch at your pace instead of trying to catch it for free on tv and missing parts of it, I really enjoy the game and I also use it as a study tool to see what the best of the best do in certain situations. I have watched mine several times now. Everyone who plays poker knows what to do with the top 10 hands as well as the worst hands(fold!!) What makes a champion is the difference of what they do with the mediocre hands. A great watch and a great study

and well worth the money.",1114560000,8,587,3.9745762711864407
2169466,3,B00065GWN8,"This is just a collection of 2003 WSOP as broadcast on ESPN.  Each of the 7 episodes is commercial-free, and it contains three poker-related short segments (1, 3 and 6 minutes in length) from other ESPN shows, but there is nothing new for this DVD set.  If you have seen the episodes on TV already, and don't expect watching the episodes again, I suggest passing this one and registering for an online satellite tournament for this year's WSOP instead.

Also, I noticed that the video is at times pretty choppy and nearly unbearably blocky.  You would think that any professional production company can do a better job of image transfer.  Oh, well.  Maybe they will do a better job for the 2004 edition (if they make it).",1106265600,13,721,4.637795275590551
2169467,5,B00065GWN8,its a most have if your a poker fan. Its awesome the way that a ameuter chris moneymaker could win with 800 people.,1101945600,,115,4.043478260869565

8039020,5,B00065GWN8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD but the only complaint I have with it is the quality of the footage.

You would expect with an ESPN branded DVD that the quality would be at the same level that one would see on TV, but this isn't ESPN's fault but rather with DVD Marketing Incorporated who produced the 2-disc set.

Aside from that it was good to see the pro's in action and it's a shame other sellers are charging high prices for the 2004 edition which, as I understand it, also suffers from a poor transfer.

Apart from the above issue the best part about this set is that there are no commercials interrupting the action and the commentary from Lon and Norman is still as good now as it was back in 2003.

It's just a shame ESPN decided to abandon making this discs because I would definitely buy more of them.",1465344000,,810,4.309210526315789
8039021,5,B00065GWN8,My husband loves this series so I bought it for him for Christmas. He has already watched it twice. It came faster than expected too.,1454457600,,133,4.36
8039022,5,B00065GWN8,Nothing beats owning the poker boom on DVD thanks to Chris Moneymaker. Provides an excellent comparison to what the game was like back then and to now.,1416441600,,151,4.62962962962963

8039024,4,B00065GWN8,"An always-interesting look back at the start of the Hold'em boom, for better or worse.  I say for better or worse because like all televised poker, the coverage is skewed towards the dramatic and thereby leaves the novice or the naive with incorrect perceptions of what solid tourney poker actually entails, namely patience.  Also, I actually prefer Omaha Hi/Lo Limit for fun homegames, and the everybody-only-plays-hold'em thing is unfortunate and limiting and sorry to say somewhat boring.... Nevertheless, I do enjoy this DVD (and hold'em, so don't get me wrong).",1395014400,,566,5.277777777777778
8039025,4,B00065GWN8,"Even if you've seen the more comprehensive 2004 WSOP DVD set, 2003 is still a must have imo. You'll want to see the crucial hands that propelled Moneymaker to the win, and the courage it took to shift gears from awestruck to dangerous. It's also interesting to see how Phil Hellmuth handles a player who needles him early in the tourney. This DVD is a keeper.",1321660800,,359,4.454545454545454
8039026,5,B00065GWN8,"I have NO Idea why ESPN stopped making htis 2 DVD set, its certainly cheap to make make and sell.  I bought on [...] yeras ago.
Very fun to watch, in 2003 Norm and Lon had bulky headsets on and spoke through a huge microphone, not like today.
Great DVD set, someone please bring it back.",1253750400,,287,4.125
8039027,5,B00065GWN8,Watch the Series that started the Current Poker craze as moneymaker turns $40 into 2.5 million.  It got me started playing.  love the extra's and no comerials.  Wish they would come out with 2005 and 2006.,1178409600,,205,4.638888888888889
8039028,5,B00065GWN8,"Great to watch the last of the 'old' world series events before the boom kicked in.

Enjoyable, informative, and highly recommended.",1169078400,,132,5.285714285714286
