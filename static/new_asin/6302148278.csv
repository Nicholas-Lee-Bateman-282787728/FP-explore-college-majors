433281,5,6302148278,"That movie impressed me since I was a kid.  Somehow, I did not encounter it till I purchased it lately through Amazon.  It is about the pioneers (some of them ruthless) which built America (In this case - Alaska).  Great actors like Richard Burton and Robert Ryan.  Happy end like Hollywood likes.",1266969600,,297,4.653846153846154
433282,4,6302148278,"Edna Ferber wrote several big, sprawling novels that captured the sights and sounds of particular American places in the 20th century. SO BIG, CIMARRON, SHOWBOAT, SARATOGA TRUNK, and GIANT were all bestsellers, with the first one winning the Pulitzer Prize, and all of them were filmed. SHOWBOAT became one of Broadway's greatest musicals. The first film version of CIMARRON won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1931. The 1956 movie version of GIANT is on just about every list of the greatest American films. Her books inspired other writers, notably James Michener (HAWAII, ALASKA, CENTENNIAL, etc.), to give us history lessons in colorful fiction.

And then there's ICE PALACE. It was her final novel (1958), and it came right after GIANT. The book was another big bestseller, but the 1960 film version was dismissed as--in the words of one critic at the time --""GIANT in snowshoes."" This is unfortunate, but understandable. Like GIANT, it tells the huge story of two men (Richard Burton and Robert Ryan) who begin as friends but become enemies in the Alaska Territory in the 40 years leading up to its statehood. They are also rivals for the love of a beautiful woman (Carolyn Jones). The film covers those 40 years and 3 generations of both families (including Martha Hyer, Jim Backus, STAR TREK's George Takei, and a very young Shirley Knight), much like the other story. But there the similarity ends.

ICE PALACE is a melodramatic, over-the-top epic, with broad performances and silly dialogue and an unimaginative director (Vincent Sherman) whose routine staging makes everything seem rather flat. The much-publicized location filming in Fairbanks is limited to a few scenes here and there--everything else was clearly done on Hollywood soundstages (check out those painted backdrops!). And the music by Max Steiner (KING KONG, GONE WITH THE WIND) is not up to his usual level. But, despite all this, it really is fun to watch. You get the fishing industry, racial prejudice, interracial romance, politics, a plane crash, fistfights, an attack by a grizzly bear (okay, a stunt man in a bear suit), perilous births, sudden deaths, the formation of our 49th state, and the 3 stars constantly shouting at one another as they age 40 years in 2-and-a-half hours. It's no GIANT, but it's interesting from start to finish. I'm glad it's finally available on DVD from WB's no-frills Archive Collection. Make a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.",1254182400,4,2434,5.037220843672457
433283,4,6302148278,"I Just wanted everyone who liked this entertaining movie to know finally this movie has been released to DVD on Warner video! Hopefully Amazon will soon have it here also. I am going to order my copy soon. I saw this movie late one night as a teen and I really loved it and it held my interest. It did for me what a movie is suppose to do, not think about what was right or wrong just purely took me away and entertained me. That is just what a movie does, tell a story and that is what a movie is all about. I have waited a long time for this and I am so happy.",1253491200,,562,3.8119658119658117

433286,5,6302148278,"I have been looking for a tape of this movie for several years, and now that I have found it, I am overjoyed.  I had seen it many times on TV in the past but it has not surfaced there for many years.  I think all of the actors and actresses are superb in their roles.  No need to say anything else but excellent for Burton, Ryan & Jones, who left us so early in life.  I admired the way the story was sprawled out in every aspect, from personal joys & sorrows and the way the all of future family members were woven into the drama to the very end.  I especially enjoy a leanthy story when it holds my interest to the very end, which this movie did; even the supporting cast held my interest because of their fine performances.  I'm looking forward to finally receiving this favorite.",1104710400,19,783,4.1866666666666665
433287,2,6302148278,"I lived in Fairbanks when this was filmed.  The population turned out to recreate the statehood parade down 2nd Ave, and the recreation parade was  better than the original.  But this was apparently cut out of the movie,  and only about 30 seconds shows the real Fairbanks.  They might as well  have saved the cost of filming on location and used a sound stage.",966816000,3,361,4.5625

433383,5,6302148278,"I have been looking for this movie for years and years!  My mother and I used to watch it on the late, late show on channel 4 in St. Louis MO in the early 60's  and it was such a great movie to watch.  Well, to tell you the truth I was so young watching the movie with my mother, I could only remember Carolyn Jones because of her beautiful eyes. I went to ask.com and asked about the movie with Carolyn Jones located in Alaska and lo and behold up popped the title, ""The Ice Palace."" I immediately ordered it on Amazon and they shipped it soooo quickly.  I was so excited to watch this movie again. It is a great movie.",1319587200,3,620,4.016260162601626
433384,2,6302148278,"While I remember enjoying this movie on its initial release some 50 years ago, seeing it again on DVD was too painful for words. The story has a good premise, that of a man (Richard Burton) who is down on his luck as the movie opens but climbs to the top on the back of a friend (Robert Shaw). It is a story typical of author Edna Ferber, who also gave us Giant, and Showboat. No wonder Warner Brothers was so excited when Ice Palace came out they purchased the rights to it as soon as possible. The movie falls way short of the novel. Ice Palace wasn't even filmed in CinemaScope, but rather the standard 35 millimeter Nowhere in the movie is there a mention of where the title came from, the palace Burton's character built for himself in his climb to the top. The outdoor scenes set in winter are hilarious. Nowhere do we see anyone's breath, a true indicator of how cold it is supposed to be. )This happens many times during the course of outdoor dramas set in winter). And whoever heard of a bear being out of hibernation in wintertime. Something had to happen to the character, though. Having just been to Alaska myself, it was fun to see the scenery as it was 50 years ago. This movie could have been so much better, but what happened is nothing less than mediocre. For Burton fans, Becket is a far better example of his acting ability. Shaw fans should see Jaws instead, and Carolyn Jones fans should view the big screen How the West Was Won.",1317168000,,1450,4.354243542435424
