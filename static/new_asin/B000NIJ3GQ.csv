In Solomon. He needs to go back and learn his Ten Commandments.
Before he is shown teaching the children incorrectly.

2769044,1,B000NIJ3GQ,"B E W A R E !  READ BEFORE ORDERING !Products from this seller will likely not work in your American DVD player!! The seller does NOT caution buyers about this. Somewhere within their ""small print"" on the seller's site it only states:  ""PAL format"".  These nine letters serve as the ONLY indication that their DVDs will NOT play in American DVD players.  Therefore, in the likely event that you do not happen to be in the business of manufacturing DVD discs or players yourself, you may not realize that ""PAL format"" means their DVDs will NOT play on American-purchased DVD players.  [Also, don't overlook that their ""PAL"" has nothing to do with Pay""PAL""].  We ordered an expensive set of 17 DVDs.  When it promptly arrived from England it was in perfect condition and appeared just as advertised! However, none of the DVDs would play in our ordinary Sony DVD player!  So rather than just throw out the DVD discs and throw away the money we had just spent, we reluctantly took many 30-minute time-outs to email back &forth with the seller.  They always replied quickly, but repeatedly informed us it was just too bad that we didn't know their meaning of ""PAL"".  Well, now we know.  And we want other American DVD player owners to also know!!  That's why we're spending even more time to write this unhappy review.  Regardless of our repeated attempts to explain to the seller how unreasonable it is that their site offers NO caution about the differences in European DVD discs/players, the seller would NOT pay for postage back to England.  So we lost nearly $30. in postage (in order to return the DVD set to the England address), at which time the seller quickly refunded our credit card (but they subtracted from our refund the co$t of their postage to send the DVDs to us in the U.S.).  Buyer beware.",1343865600,40,1804,4.646687697160884

8177941,1,B000NIJ3GQ,This DVD set is NOT for U.S. DVD players. I bought this using the iPhone app and it did not state that it was Region 2. It was a birthday present that I bought early therefore I could not return due to the fact that it two days outside the return window. $261.52 down the drain. Why make this available to U.S. consumers?,1436140800,2,321,4.111111111111111

8177946,4,B000NIJ3GQ,"Best selling Bible Series of all time! For those who want the U.S. Edition set though, purchase the Bible Collection 20 Disc DVD Special Edition Set on amazon. Its cheaper than this one, has all the same movies, IS compatible on U.S. DVD players (only plays on US DVD players) and has a couple extra movies like Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston, Quo Vadis and a Jesus movie. Search for ""Bible Collection 20 Disc DVD Special Edition Set"" on Amazon, it will be on the top of the list. Hope This Helps!!",1394236800,4,505,4.5

8177948,4,B000NIJ3GQ,"Item delivered on time , box and package ok.
Even it is a recent copy , it doesn't have subtitles or any other language and I send it as a present to Chile , a spanish speaker country.
If you buy all dvd separated, those DVD's are in spanish and English language and several subtitles.
On the other hand the Box set it's only PAL system but again  if you buy it separated they are in NTSC and PAL
I would like an answer from Seller
Thanks",1370476800,3,438,4.0344827586206895
