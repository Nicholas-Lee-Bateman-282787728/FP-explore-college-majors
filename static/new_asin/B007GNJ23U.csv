8516457,4,B007GNJ23U,"The movie was much better than I expectred after reading the other reviews. The music was atmospheric, the locations eerie, the acting solid, the sound design impressive and the zombie fights fast and frenetic. It's no surprise to me to learn that X Kult has put this out in limited hardbox. There was more than enough character development, it was just done in a subtle way that required you to pay attention. It's an easy movie to get your story facts wrong about, but I thought it provided a satisfying pay-off. This is, when all is said and done, a low-budget German zombie/cannibal flick. 28 Days Later and The Road are clearly influences. Sure, the pacing is somewhat slow for the first fifteen minutes, but there are a number of impressive zombie/crazies assaults, most notably a terrific subway station attack - great use of a real location here proves that with imagination a low budget film can have impressive looking sets. Ultimately, if you're a fan of 28 Days/Crazies type films, and haven't yet becopme completely burned out on the glut of these 'after the cataclysmic event' storylines you could do a lot worse. Pair with the equally excellent 'The Day', for a sombre but entertaining apocalyptic cannibalistic chicks-kicking-major-ass-atistic double feature.",1379376000,,1275,5.04739336492891

8516459,3,B007GNJ23U,"Eloise (Samantha Richter) is out partying with two guys. She has taken acid while being exposed to toxic chemicals being sprayed in a field. The world she lives in is green and colorful. When Eloise goes to sleep, she wakes up in a very different world. In this world everything is drab. People wear gas masks to prevent from getting infected. Infected people are called sleepers (not zombies) as they stand around all day as if they are asleep. They are flesh eaters, fast moving, and one had a diabolical laugh while he was killing and eating a person, something I would like to have seen more of. The man who rescues her believes she is from ""The Green Island"" a fictional safe haven. In the drab sleeper world Eloise has memory loss.

The infection is explained as is the mystery surrounding Eloise.

The film is in German with English misspelled subtitles. Fields is spelled ""fealds."" People is ""Poeple."" and Fate is ""fake.""

Parental guide: F-bomb, sex, near rape, brief nudity (male and female)",1348531200,,1001,4.741379310344827
8516460,1,B007GNJ23U,"This is an awful movie. The story line is non-existent, the characters are empty, and the editing/directing are childish. The movie was built around the special effects (and those are not special at all) of zombies eating flesh. Garbage, not only should you not buy this, don't even watch it. Thankfully I borrowed it from my library so it only cost me 90 minutes of my life.",1344038400,,375,4.611940298507463
