7840719,4,6303183832,"Five part series follows fictional Hornet Squadron with their Spitfires for roughly one year, from just before Chamberlain's speech of Sept. 3, 1939 to Sept. 7, 1940.  They transfer to France with a new commanding officer that served in WW1 who runs things like a country squire.  The long wait of ""The Phony War""  gives way to the invasion of France in May, and after retreat, to the Battle Of Britain.  Along the way, all but two of the original pilots are lost.

The series is a compounding of the early errors and realities of war, so it has a sad realistic ending.  The aircraft restored for the 1969 Battle Of Britain film are reused, and some aerial explosions are taken from that footage, but there is plenty of other newly shot scenes.",1420588800,,744,4.556390977443609
7840720,4,6303183832,"I am of the older generation and lived through the War (WWII) years. When I first saw this production years back on Masterpiece Theater with Host Alistair McLean, I enjoyed every moment of the moving emotional story of men at war and all the exciting action. I thought then, how well done this production was done in terms of story, acting and the truly authentic locales. I was particularly happy for the closed captions as I have always not completely understand the British accent when I saw this series on PBS Television. Years later, I am now partially deaf and CC would have been a tremendous DVD feature but Alas such is not the case. I still am happy I purchased it though just to watch the most magnificent flight and action of the incomparable ""Spitfire"" fighter doing what it did better than any other aircraft, win the skies over England.",1165449600,,850,4.635761589403973
7840721,5,6303183832,"I saw this series once, when it ran on Masterpiece Theatre in the late 1980s.  I've never forgotten it.  That's how good it is.
The PBS station in the Washington, D.C. area is, happily, re-running the series right now (WETA, Sunday evenings at 8).  Watch it if you can.  If not, you know where you can buy it.
This is a study of a group of young men -- well, okay, most of the actors aren't as young as they should be for historical accuracy -- and how they respond to risk, and loss, and each others' personalities.  The pace is stately.  Though the aerial combat scenes are genuinely thrilling, there are long, long stretches with no action at all.  The series is all about dialogue and expressions.
Two performances stand out for me.  Boyd Gaines is sensational as the American pilot in this very British squadron.  He comes across as both dashing and touching, a man carrying on despite terrible stress.  Neil Dudgeon also excels at the tougher assignment of playing ""Moggy"" Cattermole, the squadron jerk...mostly.  (That's one of the pleasures of this series.  No one is entirely sympathetic or entirely unsympathetic.)",1034553600,8,1124,4.766839378238342
7840722,4,6303183832,"I saw the original on Master Piece Theater and really liked the presentation as a whole. Interesting story line, beauitful phototgraphy and flying. As for accuracy and chacters it left a little to be desired. I think that in checking that one will find that the English wouldn't allow their precious ""Spits"" to go to France although they did send some Hurrcanes. ""Spitfire envy?"" Churchill wisely not flushing good material down the toilet when they knew what was going to happen in a few months. Most of the  chacters were off a bit I felt too. After reading ""A Fighter Pilots Anthology"" and other works which told of the premier of this film shown to the actual surviving pilots of the Battle that many of them left the theater early because of this aspect. Remember, in 1939 the RAF was more or less a Gentleman Warrior's Club to be supplemented by a volunteer force as the ""Gentlemen"" were killed off. This was a brand new type of combat to the military so all were learning as they went. They were after all just plain people who were doing the very best with what they had. Which of course makes them all Heros. So in essence knowing this, I didn't buy the set for the historical content. I bought it because I love seeing a beautiful airplane flying in beautiful settings. And I do highly recommend it.",971308800,14,1309,4.546610169491525
7840723,5,6303183832,"Piece of cake, or A Piece of Cake as it was known at the time (in british circles) was a great success. A compelling story, fine photography, and  more importantly (for aviation enthusiasts like myself) excellent flying  shots of those well preserved aircraft we have over here. (incidentally,  for you aviation boffins, the aircraft flying were, MH434, NH238, PL983,  and G-BOML and others for the Gerries, with several fibreglass mock-ups for  effect). No, truly, without going into ridiculous detail this was a great  contribution to the list of those great air-war movies that are our  heritage. Truly a piece of cake, and a great commemoration to ""the  few"".
Incidentally, if any of these words are spelt strangely, it's  because we write things properly over here!
(also, that's another great  drama you will not have seen)
Sorry Yankee chaps!
Buy it!",967420800,10,857,5.057142857142857
7840724,5,6303183832,"Viewed this film when originally shown on Masterpiece Theatre (PBS) late  August or early September 1990 near or on the fiftieth (50th) Anniversary  of ""Battle of Britain"".
Recorded it at the time, but over years  some got recorded over. Tried and tried without success over the past few  years to obtain VHS of the series. Even contacted WGBH (PBS Boston) for a  copy and was told none were available.
Am overjoyed to have finally found  one.",965952000,5,443,4.7631578947368425
