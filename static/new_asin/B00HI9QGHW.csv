6166631,3,B00HI9QGHW,"This play had an uplifting message. We can never give up when we face adversity in life. The play comments on relationships and fidelity. The point is made that if a man really loves a woman he will marry her. I agree with that. I am a fan of Mr. Woodbine but he seemed to phone in his performance in this. I am not a fan of Lavell Crawford and I don't think that he was funny. Denise Boutte is beautiful and her performance was great. The rest of the cast did a good job. I love the fact that Mr. Johnsons play makes it clear that real men take care of their women. This is a fact that is often overlooked. Recommended for fans of comedic, romantic stage plays. This would be rated PG or PG-13 for mature situations. No sex, profanity, nudity or violence.",1403740800,,756,4.184931506849315

6166633,2,B00HI9QGHW,"For having such a great cast especially Bokeem Woodbine whom you haven't seen in a long while, I was looking for a better story line and connection, but it was very flat. Je'Caryous new play ""Men Money and Golddiggers is excellent. I guess one  is a fuller for the Golddigger play.....I will always support his work.",1398643200,2,316,4.642857142857143
