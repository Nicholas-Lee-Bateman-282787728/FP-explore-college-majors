7868949,2,6304347030,"Jayne Mansfield stars in this low-budget British melodrama about a tough strip-joint owner (Leo Genn) and his girl Friday (Mansfield) who must contend with a take-over move by hostile hoods in the sleazy Soho district of London.
Mansfield is surprisingly effective in this straight dramatic role, but the real reason she's in the film is for the semi-nude dance number she does.  Scenes from this dance were featured in a 1967 Playboy article.
But evidently this video is the export version for the beknighted American audience of the uncut British original.  Mansfield is clearly not semi-nude in a transparent gown here.  The gown is very modest and demure in this edition.  Be advised.
The image and sound quality of this VHS tape are just average.  I recommend it only to nostalgia fans.
The director of this film, Terence Young, became much better known a few years later as the director of the James Bond films Doctor No, From Russia With Love, and Thunderball,",1025481600,6,967,4.9079754601226995
