7808655,5,6300988724,"Only Kirk, Spock and McCoy knew what had happened on Holberg 917G, but Kirk would forget--because someone loved him enough to relieve his pain.

The best science fiction opens thrilling vistas of the mind, while remaining driven by character. ""Requiem for Methuselah"" is the best. It delivers the intellectual sizzle and emotional wallop we crave, not just from ""Star Trek,"" but from all of our stories and movies.

This late third-season episode, from science fiction writer Jerome Bixby, isn't without missteps. The scene where Flint miniaturizes the Enterprise borders on the absurd, and the fistfight is unnecessary. But the strengths more than make up for the flaws.

The character of Spock is never more appealing. He's revealed as a connoisseur of art and a pianist of some ability. Intellectually and emotionally perceptive, he tries to head off catastrophe for his shipmates.

In the justly famous denouement, McCoy lectures Spock, pitying Spock's supposed inability to love. For once, McCoy misjudges him.

The Enterprise warps out of orbit. Kirk, Spock and McCoy go their way across the Galaxy, leaving below them a very old man who will presumably build yet another android companion to relieve his loneliness. As for the Enterprise trio, they have each other. And us? It's a pity that every ""Star Trek"" episode wasn't this good--but we'll always have ""Requiem for Methusaleh.""",1354233600,,1389,5.210762331838565
7808656,5,6300988724,"Requiem for Methuselah is proof that the Third Season was great.  This episode is so moving, especially with Dr. McCoy's little gem of a speech. However, it turns out that Spock does have feelings and this is evident when he eases his best friend's pain at the end of the episode. RFM talks about impossible love, the joys and agonies of love, immortality, and so many other aspects of humanity.",1242259200,,395,4.642857142857143
7808657,3,6300988724,"There is a scene in this episode -- the last -- which ranks among the finest in Star Trek. Unfortunately, there's 50 minutes of an otherwise bad episode to get through first. The episode does contain a solid premise: a man has perfect genes that make him immortal. How has he used that immortality? By developing prodigious talents over the centuries and becoming some of the most famous men of history, but later becoming a recluse. For thousands of years, he had to pretend to age and then move on.

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to a planet in search of a chemical they need to save the Enterprise. The crew has the deadly Rigelian Fever which will kill everyone within hours, unless McCoy can get a substance called ritalen with which to immunize the crew. There on the planet they meet the reclusive Mr. Flint (James Daly), a man who is 6,000 years old, who at first turns them away but changes his mind when they mention the ravaging effects of the disease. Flint has a flashback in which he remembers the Black Plague of the Middle Ages.

So far, so good. But instead of worrying about the 400+ crewmembers who are about to die, Kirk is distracted by Flint's pretty young ""ward,"" Rayna, with whom he immediately falls in love even though she turns out to be an android Flint created for himself. Given what happens in the plot, there was perhaps no way to rewrite this; but it contradicts everything we are usually shown about Kirk being the responsible leader. Who cares if hundreds of his shipmates are about to die, he's gotta get the girl! Mr. Flint, for his part, shows at first that his advanced technology gives him mastery over the Enterprise. But later, provoked to jealousy by Kirk's attentions to Rayna, he engages in an old-fashioned fist fight. Give us a break.

The lovely Louise Sorrell portrays Rayna nicely, showing vulnerability from the start. This episode presents a view of machine-based intelligence that is not entirely negative. Flint created Rayna for essentially the same reason Dr. Korby created Andrea in ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" and let me give you a clue, the beautiful female android is not built just so that the designer might have a bowling partner! Still, the differences are significant. Andrea was essentially a bimbo, though smart enough to carry out orders; in contrast, Rayna would like to discuss ""sub-dimensional physics"" with Mr. Spock. Andrea had no regard for life at all; Rayna's deep regard for the feelings of others ultimately kills her (or rather, terminates her programming?).

The final scene, ending with the word ""Forget,"" almost redeems the episode. I suppose if Kirk had to fall in love with an android, this was the one to fall for. Watch also for McCoy's little gem of a speech to Spock in that scene, once again highlighting De Kelly's acting talents.",1183420800,,2828,4.741869918699187
7808658,5,6300988724,"Very rarely does a STAR TREK episode live up to the memories of thirty years ago. I saw this one as a tiny tot, and remember just swooning over the ""confession"" of the wise old Mr. Flint -- ""yes, I was Brahms. And DaVinci. And Merlin, and Alexander . . . and many, many more.""

This episode is refreshing, in that the focus is not on Kirk's macho daring, but on art and music, thoughts and feelings, philosophy and loss. Kirk and the boys are amazed to meet a fascinating wise old man in the remotest possible corner of the galaxy, whose companion seems to be an adoring and cultivated young woman. But all is not as it seems! Mr. Flint has secrets, and so does his companion Rayna. Ultimately Kirk ""loses"" one of his few fights and Mr. Spock shows an unusual amount of understanding and concern for his captain's human emotions.

This episode owes a lot to Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST. Mr. Flint is a retired magician, like Prospero. Rayna is as innocent and charming as Miranda -- and as eager to meet attractive men. The M4 Robot flits about running household errands, just like Ariel.

But this episode goes further. ""Miranda's"" isolation has tragic costs, which Shakespeare doesn't acknowledge. And Prospero's wisdom is flawed, making him both more tragic and more human. Shakespeare's magician was rather too pure -- betrayed by his brother, by Milan, by the tiresome demands of real life. Mr. Flint is far more accomplished, and also admits to having made his own share of mistakes. This episode is everything STAR TREK ever set out to be -- original and exciting entertainment, and a doorway to new worlds of art and thought.

O Brave New World!",1127520000,4,1651,4.6632302405498285
7808659,5,6300988724,"This is one of my favorite original series episodes.  It proves that even as the show was nearing cancellation, it still had lots of pizazz and power.  While most Americans have probably seen this episode many times over the years, it is difficult not to be moved by it's premise:  Impossible love, loss of immortality, and the failure of the mind to control the heart.
The beautiful Android Rayna's untimely death due to Captain Kirk and Flint's boyish wrangling is bad enough- but the most poignant scene is at the end, when Spock mind-melds with Kirk to help him forget his foolishness; a sudden end of scene, and we see the Enterprise flying away....  Very moving.  And of course, this episode has some very beautiful music, typicl of the original series score, with a gorgeous waltz made specially for this episode.
I feel this episode encapsulates all that is Star Trek, The Original Series.  It is a must have that still holds up today.",1067472000,5,943,4.719512195121951
7808660,1,6300988724,"Rigellian fever, an extremely deadly plague, strikes the Enterprise crew. Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to a supposedly uninhabited planet, Holberg 917-G, in search of the only known antidote, ryetalyn. To their surprise,  they encounter Flint and his daughter, Rayna. Not pleased to have visitors,  Flint orders his robot to gather and process ryetalyn, while the three  officers are entertained by his daughter. Due to the robot contaminating  the first batch of antidote, McCoy tells it another must be made. In the  meantime, Kirk and Rayna have become attracted to each other, to Flint's  jealous objection.  Spock has discovered, to his puzzlement, old  masterpieces on modern supplies, ie: a da Vinci painting done with modern  oils on new canvas and a unknown Brahms waltz, written on new paper. Flint  explains that he is an immortal, who wandered the Earth for centuries in  various personas, including Brahms and da Vinci. He came to this planet to  retire in peace and built the ""Rayna"" androids as his companions.  He had hoped that her involvement with Kirk would speed up her emotional  growth, but now he has become hopelessly jealous. Not understanding such  intense emotions, Rayna short-circuits and 'dies.'  The Enterprise party  takes the ryetalyn and returns to the Enterprise. McCoy tells them that  Flint, too, will soon perish because what made him immortal was the  atmosphere of Earth. Leaving it robbed him of that power.  In a  surprisingly compassionate gesture, Spock uses a Vulcan mind touch to erase  the painful memories of Rayna from Kirk's mind.",943315200,2,1583,5.125490196078432
