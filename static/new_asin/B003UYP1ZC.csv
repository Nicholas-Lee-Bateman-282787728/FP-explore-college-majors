This gem of a movie has managed to tackle the problem with appropriate and some vey funny inappropriate humor. The movie is very well done and moves along quickly.

8406294,4,B003UYP1ZC,"Having Worked with a number of people in the banking industry and seeing a lot of the downside of whats going on, I was curious as to this movies take on the subprime mess.

The fact that this film takes a stab at the funny part of having families move in together is hysterical.  Fun movie, laughed throughout, no Oscar candidates here, but then again, real people never are.

Good job, worth owning and watching.  thought the cast and crew came off as honest and hardworking.  Would recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for the typical slick hollywood crap but rather like watching a good community play put to film that pokes fun with a little social commentary thrown in for good measure.

Great little film.

I thought the premise for the idea is wonderful and it lives up to its claim. Thumbs up!",1288310400,,806,4.517241379310345
