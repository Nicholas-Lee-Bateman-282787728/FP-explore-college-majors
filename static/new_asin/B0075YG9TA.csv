[This review has SOME SPOILERS]

This video is comprised of (18) stalks/hunts presented as ''reminiscent stories'' while Jack and some partners go out on a wild pig hunt. Some of these hunts may also have appeared in other DVD titles as conversion from older VHS productions to add time or etc.

Alaska; Black (1) & Brown Bear (2) archery, Brown Bear (2) rifle, Moose archery.
- Texas; Russian Boar archery [segment #1].
New Mexico; Elk (3) archery, Elk (3) rifle.
- Texas; Russian Boar archery [segment #2].
Quebec; Caribou archery.
Utah; Rocky Mountain Goat archery.
New Mexico; Pronghorn Antelope rifle.
Texas; Bobcat archery [while after whitetail].

For the most part these segments involve ground stalks, including a couple of the bear hunts nearly turning into situations other than the hunter(s) intended. As usual however the bulk of the hunts comprise Elk stalks across the Rancho Lobo managed acreage in New Mexico.

Of additional interest is one or two of the Alaska chapters, and the Quebec caribou migration hunt, which involve travel into the hunting locale via brush aircraft. American bald eagles make a number of cameo appearances as well.

Almost all of these segments involve guided hunts for trophy mounts rather than just meat harvest, which may be off-putting to some viewers.",1482019200,,1416,5.271111111111111
