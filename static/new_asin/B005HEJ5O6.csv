8472899,4,B005HEJ5O6,City Hall starring Cha Seung Won and  Happy Together starring Lee Byung Hun.  Two of K-Drama's hottest stars.  Great twin-pack!,1364342400,,127,5.25
8472900,3,B005HEJ5O6,"I bought this two pack because of the great reviews for City Hall and I actually paid less for the two combined.

So for City Hall...it was good but not great.  I was funny and moving at times but I didn't find myself drawn into the story like I am with most KDramas.  Overall it was enjoyable.  Some of the content is suggestive so I would not recommend for family viewing.

I am currently in the middle of Happy Together and although it was done in 1999 I am really enjoying it.  I am very drawn into the story and the characters.  I will say some of the content is a bit adult (one of the family members is a ""bar hostess"").  I wouldn't recommend for family viewing.",1341273600,,669,4.171875
