8208464,4,B000TAPC7M,"When School of Horror begins, we see a woman tied up in a basement promising she won't say or tell anyone... something.  This was just a movie being shown in a classroom.  The professor says this horror-like subject matter has been done over and over a thousand times.  He's right, the genre is completely saturated.  He says the kids are walking down a well worn road.  A teen in the audience named Rocky Horror (his actual name apparently) gets upset and confronts the professor calling him an elitist.  He compares the teacher to a pebble and says he's going to walk over every single pebble.  When Rocky storms outside and talks about the situation with his girlfriend a man drives by and runs over a kid, then speeds off.

A kid named Billy Bob says he always wanted to be an actor and star, but wonders how far would we be willing to go for the things we love.  He runs out of the classroom when a kid tells him to run quick.  Somebody's going to die!  Billy Bob runs around but can't find the kid.  Rocky Horror comes up to Billy Bob and says the girl is already dead.  Billy Bob's confused.  Turns out this is just a script in a movie.  He introduces himself as Rocky Horror but doesn't see the coincidence.  He tells a story about filming a movie off campus after this girl named Sarah screamed and was found missing.  They called the police with the dogs, but nobody could find the girl.  It's like she was never even there.  Christian, the kid who told Billy Bob to run, took some time off after Sarah went missing and returned as a weirdo.  When asked what happened to Sarah, Rocky Horror says he took a picture of Sarah and captured two other people dressed as clowns in the photo.

Rocky Horror sneaks up on a teenage girl undressing.  He leaves the camera sitting on a chair turned on and the girl questions if the camera's off.  It clearly isn't!  You can see the flashing red button!  Rocky follows Billy Bob outside where two killer clowns grab him from a van, tie him up and leaves him in the van stranded in the woods.  Billy Bob escapes and hears a woman screaming for help in the woods.  He finds the girl and unties her.  He says clowns brought him here.  The girl's name is Sarah but it's not the same Sarah that's been reported missing.  ""Cut!""  This is all an act.  I hate when movies do this seriously.  One of the guys set a camera in a tree when he should have set it somewhere else.  This upset Rocky so he had to cut the scene.

The one clown tries to jump in the back of the van to leave but Rocky gets angry and tells him to beat it since he screwed up the act.  The clown mentions God but Rocky simply tells him to get lost.  Rocky and Billy Bob pick up the breast-exposed girl from earlier.  They talk about their favorite movies like the Thing and Exorcist.  They're trying to come up with a new concept for a horror movie.  Rocky took it personally when the professor said the horror genre is a cliche.  A nerdy student goes to the professor and says there's an evil student among them.  Not sure who he's referring to but Rocky seems the likeliest.  The teens all visit a bar.

A man named Virgil and his friends asks the kids if they're making a movie.  Rocky wants to shoot it here in the bar.  Rocky tells the guys he's shooting horror films.  Virgil mentions an old Indian monster or the devil himself is roaming around this town.  Every 7 years it comes out of the woods and is hungry.  The teen says ""He comes out every 7 years... to come to the bar to eat peanuts?""  lol.  Virgil says he waits for people to come to him.  The bartender mentions a story about a couple customers leaving the bar, hearing a howl and a choir of voices all howling at once.  the bartender went outside to look for them but they were gone.  The cops found fingernails embedded into the trees with scratch marks in the tree trunks.  They also found blood mixed in with flesh and hair.  Yummy!

We hear what happened 7 years earlier.  Two guys left the bar, went into the woods and the cops never found either of them again.  One theory is that this monster is a supernatural being and a cannibalistic spirit that can possess people.  I like the atmosphere here- hopefully it won't end with the men going ""Gotcha, just kidding!""  Without giving the ending away, it ends on a *much* bigger note than that!

The nerdy kid who walked into the professor's room earlier says Rocky is up to no good and has been planning something for weeks.  He says Rocky has been dreaming about murder and torture and he's not the same anymore.  Rocky's going to the bar to paint his masterpiece tonight.  The professor threatens to call the cops but the nerdy kid says he hasn't done anything yet.  A man named Curtis and Rocky get into an argument.  Curtis says all the teens better be gone by the time he gets back.  They all want to leave... except Rocky.  He thinks things are just getting interesting.  Rocky wants Billy Bob to jump Curtis from behind when he comes through the doors.

Rocky comes up with a better idea.  He wants to follow Curtis outside in case he gets attacked by that monster.  He'll have it on film for his movie.  Nobody feels safe going out there though.  Rocky encourages Billy Bob to walk outside and film.  Meanwhile the professor is driving around looking for Rocky.  Billy Bob and some kid walk through the dark woods looking for Curtis anticipating that he'll jump them both.  At the bar the teens don't believe the 7-year monster story.  The girl of the group says nobody's actually seen the monster.  It's too much of a coincidence it only shows up in small towns.  It's hard to believe the teens happen to be here the night it returns.  Billy Bob and the kid hear a scream.  They soon panic and run.  Billy Bob runs back to the bar.  The girlfriend of Curtis wants to know where Curtis is.  When Billy Bob mentions the screams they fear the worst.

A friend of Curtis thinks Billy Bob and the kid he was with jumped Curtis and that he's being set up.  This friend of Curtis takes out a knife and flashes it around.  The kid with Billy Bob suddenly is thrown through the window of the bar before being dragged back out.  Curtis' friend is still upset and thinks the teens are up to something.  Meanwhile Rocky's walking around with a camera recording these events and enjoying every moment.  Curtis' friend suddenly walks through a door with a knife in his back.  There's something strange going on concerning the back room of this bar.  A friend of Curtis' friend kicks him to see if he's still alive.  Another friend tells him to stop so he can figure out if he's still breathing or not, lol.  They conclude he was stabbed by his own knife.  A friend questions how he managed to stab himself, but his other friend calls him a dummy and says ""Someone *else* stabbed him silly!"" The teens think Curtis and his girlfriend are setting up everyone.  If you think the story's confusing now, just you wait!

Rocky recommends tossing Curtis girlfriend outside to see if the monster attacks her.  If she comes back unscratched we know it's a set up.  A kid says he can't see anything when he looks outside and says someone could be waving their weiner at him and he'd still be smiling like a village idiot, lol.  The lights in the bar go out, and someone opens the door and pulls somebody outside.  It's dark so it's hard to tell who's being pulled out.  The teens argue.  They blame Billy Bob because he told everyone the guy with the stabbed back is dead but when the lights come back on his body is missing.  When a girl runs out the door suddenly her bloody head is kicked back inside.  This makes Billy Bob throw up.

The phone is out.  Rocky picks up the girls head and Billy Bob thinks he should put it down.  He agree ""It is getting a bit messy"".  ""Get the door for me Billy Bob- I'll chuck it outside"".  LOL!  ""Hey Virgil, why don't you get the door for the little lady"".  Rocky throws Virgil the girl's head.  ""Catch!""  He runs outside screaming only to get smacked by someone with a baseball bat.  It certainly wasn't a Phillies player making contact since they aren't doing well this year.  The bartender wants to know why Rocky sent Virgil outside.  Rocky asks if he wants to settle this outside.  The bartender says ""Stay away from me!""

Billy Bob wants to spend the night in the bar.  Rocky agrees to see how this will play out.  The professor calls the nerdy kid and tells him to call the cops right away.  He relaxes and reads a book while singing to himself instead, lol.  Meanwhile back at the bar the bartender sees a woman demon standing outside and becomes too stunned to speak.  He passes out.  Rocky says he's getting sick of Billy Bob.  Rocky says to grab the bartender and throw him outside.  A diversion is the explanation behind this.  Rocky and the other teens will run to the van while the monster feeds on the bartender.  They struggle to get the bartender outside since he's heavy.  When two guys finally get the bartender outside Rocky locks them out all out there.  They bang on the door to get inside.  Rocky tells them to move the bartender 15 feet from the door like he asked.  He then lets the guys inside and waits.

Rocky tells the guys to open the front door when the bartender's body is gone.  The guys says ""How do you know he's gone?""  Rocky says ""I just know!"" But seriously, how does he know?  It's hard to believe everyone just lets Rocky be a demanding jerk and let him continue filming the movie acting like everything's fine while people are getting murdered.  As two men run to the van they're attacked from behind and killed.  Rocky deliberately gave them the dorm keys instead of the van keys.  Billy Bob smacks the smirk off Rocky's face.  Rocky says he has enough of Billy Bob but seriously, I think we've all had enough of Rocky.  Rocky beats up Billy Bob by kicking his ribs.  He says he (Rocky's) the villain and he's making it out of here so the villain can win this time.

Rocky says he and Sarah are making it out of here.  Sarah tells him this isn't a movie. Rocky says ""Of course it's not a movie, capturing the real thing is better!""  Rocky tells Sarah to open the door but she says we're all leaving together.  Rocky is definitely in on these murders now.  It's obvious when Rocky lets Sarah get captured by the murderer behind that door.  Billy Bob says Rocky needs an antagonist to get him out of here because Billy Bob knows the script.  Rocky says Billy Bob's his only way out of here and smacks him with the camera.  Rocky tosses Billy Bob into the back room where all these murders seem to be happening when suddenly Billy Bob gets the upperhand and the monster attacks Rocky.

While Billy Bob is the last survivor and has a drink Rocky and Sarah come back in.  What, they're alive?  Don't tell me this is one of those ""Cut!"" or ""Job well done Billy Bob- you followed our script to a tea!"" moments.  Okay it's not.  Thank goodness.  Rocky wants his camera back. Billy Bob smacks the back of his head with a bottle.  Rocky beats on Sarah who intervenes.  Rocky says he has to go.  Billy Bob and Sarah try to leave together.  In the back room Rocky says ""Cut!"" when his friend cuts a woman's neck the wrong way.  Billy Bob asks Rocky what's going on since he's just as confused as the viewers are!  Rocky says he's making a movie.

Billy Bob says he saw the monster killed somebody.  But... he can't explain it.  ""Wait, that wasn't real?"" says Billy Bob.  Rocky agrees.  But... Rocky says the people in the bar really are all dead.  The professor comes in.  Rocky says ""Hey professor, you said it's impossible to make an original horror movie these days.  Well here's one where people are really dying.  How's that for original!""  Rocky hired everyone we see at the bar and gave all these actors lines to say.  Sarah was in on it too, except she didn't know Rocky was going to actually kill.  Curtis was doing the killings outside while Rocky could take care of the people inside.

The professor asks why he's doing this.  Rocky says it's because the professor stomps on the hopes and dreams of his students.  ""What more could I ask for!""  Billy Bob says these were all his friend that Rocky killed, but he says they were all actors.  Billy Bob thinks if he takes this film to Hollywood they'll find him out and realize he's a murderer, but he says ""At least I get my 15 minutes of fame"" and ""My name will live forever"".  Rocky says he will take care of the bodies.  He's concerned someone will spill the beans and tell the cops what really happened here tonight.  Rocky appears to prepare and attack Billy Bob after this but... actually turns and beats up his other friend instead!

MAJOR SPOILERS!!

Rocky says Billy Bob is the hero.  He survived!  But the professor has to go.  Billy Bob intervenes.  Billy Bob thinks about the nerdy kid saying something bad is going to happen tonight.  The professor says to Billy Bob ""You set Rocky up!""  Rocky agrees he's been set up by Billy Bob.  The professor thinks about this situation some more.  ""Billy Bob's the murderer, the professor is the witness, and Rocky is just the camera man looking for attention that any starving actor would want!""

Billy Bob says ""You've got it all figured out professor"" when the professor accuses him of being the murderer.  Sarah shoots the professor, hands the gun to Rocky and says ""Rocky, you shouldn't have shot the professor"".  Oh wow, Sarah and Billy were in on it together!  Billy Bob says his name is Jack Terry.  He says Sarah knew a lot more than Rocky realized, and that he should give her more credit.  ""In your quest to use, abuse and destroy every one of your friends in order to achieve your goal, the last person to be used tonight is you Rocky"".  ""You are a genius!"" ""Stick to the script and you'll make us all famous!""

Billy Bob drives Rocky to the woods and says ""Remember, we saw you shoot the professor so don't try to make a comeback.  Now get lost!""  Billy Bob narrates the ending.  The police found evidence outside the tavern.  A video tape that mentions the disappearance of all the people who went missing.  Billy Bob got a call for a three picture deal in the movie business. Sarah went with a different offer.  ""You must ask yourself- how far would you go to become a star"".  ""Me, I told the world the lie of my life and I will never look back"" says Billy Bob.

A very clever ending!  It's a little confusing too since I can't quite figure out what happened, but that's because the writing and in particular the twist is so good I can't grasp it, nor can I grasp all the events that led up to this magnificent ending.  Highly recommended.  The acting's a bit weak and you won't see much in the way of a monster that supposedly comes out every 7 years, but you WILL get a really fantastic story if you chose to stick with it.  There's a LOT going on though, so you'll need to watch this movie twice to grasp it all.",1500681600,,14926,4.373265157048941
