8247478,5,B0012RLWR0,"This film is not bad at all. Great acting, humorous, and touching. Things really light up when Bern Nadette Stanis is on camera. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.",1490745600,,189,4.757575757575758
8247479,1,B0012RLWR0,So boring. Couldn't even finish watching it.,1479081600,,44,5.428571428571429
8247480,1,B0012RLWR0,"This sounded like it might be funny and perhaps the premise is, but the execution of this premise is done so poorly it is remarkable. The acting is worse than your typical amateurs! Do not buy this film!",1291766400,,203,4.368421052631579
8247481,4,B0012RLWR0,"The movie was ok, but nothing really to get excited about. It was definitely a low budget movie.",1239753600,,96,4.388888888888889
8247482,1,B0012RLWR0,This was so bad!  This is lower than low budget.  If you just get off on watching IR than fine get it but seriously... it's bad!,1237334400,,128,3.8846153846153846
8247483,4,B0012RLWR0,"There are a couple good things about this movie, really.
Yes, the plot is predictable, but which Hollywood movie have you seen lately you haven't guessed then ending, and the production is not that great.
But the acting of  the two newcomers, Tenique Mathieu and Andy Gershenzon is excellent. I only hope that they get some really good movie roles soon.
It's a family movie so no, it doesn't attempt to solve all racial and social ills. It's a comedy, relax and you'll have a few laughs.",1215216000,5,487,4.597701149425287
8247484,1,B0012RLWR0,"Like all African Americans, I just love seeing Thelma from ""Good Times.""  However, that's the end of my praise.

This movie had bad acting, bad timing, and a predictible plot.  This has the same, tired line of stock characters that you would expect.  Why is it that in this most Black film, the only gay character is white!?  Again, Black gays are erased so that folk can lie about ""We don't have that in OUR community!"" and then folk wonder why some brothas are on the down-low! (Actually, the multicultural and excellent film ""What's Cooking?"" rendered homosexuality entirely white and most heterosexuality was portrayed of color too, but not in the sloppy fashion here.)

There are better films about interracial marriages out there.  It's ludicrous and shameful that any adult would fail to tell their parents that they had a child.

The jokes are corny.  The main characters are stupid and then they wonder why support characters are just as stupid.  This film is sooooo poor-quality that it boggles the mind.  I can't believe I let some brain cells die in watching this stinker.  This film is clearly designed for viewers who think no movie can be a bad movie.  I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy!",1213142400,4,1218,4.742857142857143
