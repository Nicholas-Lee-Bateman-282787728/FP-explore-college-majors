7371021,4,B013T5IH52,"I love The Tenors and saw them perform live when Clifton Murray was new to the group, so it's been a few years.  I also have DVDs of the programs they recorded at The Royal Conservatory in Toronto, and the ""Lead With Your Heart"" tour in Las Vegas.  Compared with those two DVDs, the performances on this DVD seemed rather lackluster.  There was no banter between the members in between songs, the intros to the songs were either not there or hurried, the songs each individual member sang were ok but not nearly as good as their individual songs on the other DVDs.  Of course the four of them singing together was outstanding, but the video seems to have a sort of ""thrown together"" feel rather than something well thought out and polished like the other two DVDs.  If you're a real Tenors fan, you'll want to add this to your collection, but I suspect you won't be watching it as much as you watch the others.",1474329600,,910,4.425149700598802

7371024,4,B013T5IH52,"I am a HUGE fan of The Tenors, but, I did find this dvd to be a bit to 'edited' and felt like I wasn't getting the entire concert. 'Leading With Your Heart' live in Las Vegas is truly the best and my favourite. But I do love these guys and hope they will continue putting out their concerts on dvd.",1464307200,,298,3.901639344262295

7371040,5,B013T5IH52,"As always I loved the performance.  They are my favorite singing group.  The song that really got me was ""Time to Say Goodbye"".  I know Victor equated it with how they feel leaving their families to tour, etc.  My memory of the song is because we played it at my daughter's memorial service back in 2008.  At that time the only version I had was Paul Potts, but his voice is great also.  So, thank you Tenors for another wonderful DVD.",1450137600,3,435,4.308641975308642
