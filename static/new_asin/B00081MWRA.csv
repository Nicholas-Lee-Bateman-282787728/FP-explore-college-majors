2256890,5,B00081MWRA,"I was blown away by how good this film was. Everything about it was superb, the acting most of all. Ran Mukherjee was phenomenal, i have always been a fan of hers but i never knew that she was capable of this. The fact that it was a remake of the Miracle Worker turned me off a bit, I didn't think that it was a movie that could be remade and done better, but Black did it. It also being a Hindi movie makes it even more extraordinary because now the entire world can see Indian Cinema at its best. This movie is going to sweep every award next season and if this doesn't get any acclaim at the awards show here in the US, then i will have lost all faith in them.",1126742400,3,663,3.955223880597015
2256891,5,B00081MWRA,"The only reason I did not get up and clap at the end of the film was because I was a bit too taken aback by the strange flood of emotions in tears this film brought out from me. I have never seen a film with this torturously significant direction of mind. Amitabh Bachchan might live a hundred years but it is without a doubt in 2005 that he actually reached a level beyond being called ""superhuman"" His acting is synonmous and quite close to what my faithful description of people's God might be. (I Don't beleive in God mind you)

Rani Mukherjee on the other hand who plays the role of Michelle gives to this film what no actor possibly could have given. She does indeed outshine anything remotely addressed to impress. I lost count of the number of times I shamelessly let out the tears. However, like a lot of illiterate teenagers and middle aged people, I do not call this film depressive. Infact, I call it a challanging inspiration of sorts. After this film, I realised I will watch all movies involving Amitabh Bachchan and more importantly Rani Mukherjee.

To play the life of a human who can't see,hear,touch as well as Rani does for this film is simply unbelievable. The next time I run into Amitabh Bachchan I will make sure I touch his feet. He's the closest to God we'll ever be.

Time and again, I think of the best films I have seen in Bollywood but this one film right here makes them all shudder and sit back 20 rows from the first row that belongs to Black.

The last scene of this film is quite possibly the most emotionally jolting scene I have ever witnessed in my life. It's sad that many people died before watching ""Black"" or many might not witness the epic.

If you have remotely liked a film in your life,then I order you to watch ""Black"" No matter who you are and where you reside.

2256892,5,B00081MWRA,Black was an amazing film. the actress playing Michelle was mind blowing! no songs but the story and script make up for it. I would recommend this to anyone even if you aren't a bollywood fan!!,1120176000,3,193,4.388888888888889

2256894,5,B00081MWRA,"Absolutely OScar worthy effort from Amitabh and the young girl who plays the blind Rani. Rani hams it a bit at times, but is mostly adequate and at times, good. See it - is it 85% in English and will keep you spellbound.",1113436800,3,220,4.1395348837209305
2256895,5,B00081MWRA,"Ever wondered a life without Sound or Sight, where Silence is the ruler! It could be a dreadful thought for people like you & me(the 'gifted' lot), but the blatant reality comprises of many millions who are branded as 'challenged' lot. 'Black' attempts to unfold this world of darkness where every color is free of its meaning and where every feeling felt comes thru, they are more spirited and pull off challenges with aplomb. They don't need any mercy or don't moan in general.. subtly suggesting us to be little more grateful about what we have and who we are.

Sanjay Leela Bhansali arrived in Indian Film industry with 'Khamoshi:The Musical', a film on the subject of deaf & mute. With 'Black' he moved a step ahead and deeper by choosing to trade on an unusual path of selecting a subject inspired by Hellen Keller's life. Well-known for his prolific passionate films where music & dance gain an adequate repute comes a film which is songless yet musical, troubling yet touching, painful yet pleasant.

Lot of films on blind & mute have been made in the past. My memory somehow selects to remember Sai Paranjpe's Sparsh(1980) for reasons 1. Rightly portraying that challenged people do not need any sympathy, 2. Not creating any melodrama out of tragedy and 3. Naseeruddin Shah's performance.

'Black' revolves around Michelle McNally(Ayesha Kapoor,Rani Mukherjee) who is unfortunately a physically challenged child since a very young age,but fortunately how an ageing anguished teacher Debraj Sahai(Amitabh Bachchan) brings ray(s) of light in her dark life. A ray of light entering a dark room thru a small hole is such an effortless natural event, sounds simple but not for Sahai who has to train a girl whose disabilties have turned her into a riotous brat. Words like impossible & inconfidence doesn't exist in Sahai's life and this is precisely the things that need to be inculcated in young Michelle's mind and heart through the language of touch.. where fingers become words and a window to express desires and fulfil dreams.

A totally performance-driven film where every actor emerged a winner. With a handful of characters to concentrate on, Bhansali succeeds in extracting the best never-seen-before act from all of them. Be it little Ayesha's brilliant out-cry or her parents' Shernaz Patel & Dhritiman Chatterjee's sublime sorrow or Nandana Sen's very natural sister insticts. Rani is not surprising, but very realistic in delivering the finest nuances of Michelle's character to perfection. Bachchan's repository of acting seems to be hoarded for such films where he tries to compliment his artist's yearnings totally by taking him on a very high respectable status. Watching Bachchan and Rani together achieving little big victories is so enchanting that we're caught unawares by our tears and  smiles merging with theirs.

This is Bhansali's most beautiful belief painted on 70mm. To give wings to his aesthetics there is his team of techinicians who need a big round of applause and mention for their commendable work in the field of Cinematography(Ravi K Chandran), Background Score(Monty), Art Direction (Omung Kumar),Dialogues(Prakesh Kapadia) & Editing(Bela Segal).

Black color has a very universal appeal in general, so will this 'Black' appeal you completely and welcome you into a new genre of Indian cinema.",1112832000,8,3339,5.149446494464945

2256897,5,B00081MWRA,"Extremely moving film, based loosely on the Helen Keller story, transplanted to India.

Stylistically, this is very much a Bollywood film.  No songs , but larger than life performances  which are still enthralling and rooted in real emotions.  An operatic feel  that doesnt undermine the storys power.  Exquisite, but highly expressionistic and stylized photography.  In other words, its the correlative opposite of Arthur Penns gritty, real The Miracle Worker, but it succeeds just as powerfully on its own terms.

Bollywood sometimes manages make movies the way that Hollywood did in the 1930s-1950s; they aren't afraid of theatricality, but they use that quality just right, so it enhances instead of undermining the storytelling.  The film may have been consciously pushing my buttons, but it all worked, making me weep more than once.  And a number of images have haunted me since seeing it.",1398297600,3,896,5.246478873239437
2256898,5,B00081MWRA,it was a great movie a very good story with great acting  by both stars. the mother in the movie was also great I think that anyone who watches this can not help but loving it . Rani Mukherjee was terrific as Amitabh bachchan was as her teacher .I highly reccomened this movie.,1377302400,,277,4.226415094339623
2256899,5,B00081MWRA,"It is a beautiful, inspirational and breath-taking movie. I believe acting was very convincing, and story was touching. It is difficult to forget the light in teacher's eyes, absolutely beautiful!",1366848000,2,196,5.566666666666666

2256901,2,B00081MWRA,"This was just a Bollywood remake of The Helen Keller Story. I do adore Rani Mukherjee as an actress. I like how she takes risk and this was a big one, but not one I favored. Also why did the actor, Amitabh Bachchan, keep on that stupid hat throughout the movie? Anyway, this would have been better with an original screenplay like Barfi, or My Name Is Kahn. Nice try but not convincing. Sorry.",1360627200,,393,4.324324324324325
2256902,5,B00081MWRA,Beautiful cinematography. Dark vs. light theme perfectly played throughout the film. Inspirational story and superb acting. I would love to see this director do more and be recognized for his wonderful skill and story choices.,1360368000,,226,5.485714285714286
2256903,2,B00081MWRA,"holy smokes, what a cheesy, horribly acted, poorly scripted, highly rated (by indians i can only presume) flick. ive seen better film on dishwater that's set all night. perhaps coming from bollywood this is quality, but in relation to any films that are actually of merit or well made, this compares like macdonalds to homecooking..there is none. from the starting scene where the ""blind"" lady is noticing the snow...you can tell she sees it, from then on the acting is weak, the story telegraphed, and the scripting..well, you can take a film out of bollywood, but you cant take bollywood out of the film. amazing these other reviewers are so blind..or so biased.",1359849600,,664,4.884955752212389
2256904,3,B00081MWRA,"The same points constantly recur throughout the movie and the end is predictable, but the for a Indian production this movie is a breath of fresh air since it's void of villans, romance, songs, and dance",1357862400,,203,4.666666666666667
2256905,5,B00081MWRA,"Fantastic film! I have always enjoyed The Miracle Worker, and I wasn't sure if this could live up to it, but it did.  It's a visually stunning film, and Rani Mukherjee and Amitabh Bachchan deliver top notch performances.  Glad to have this in my collection.",1353369600,2,257,4.688888888888889
2256906,5,B00081MWRA,"An excellent movie I should have purchased this long ago.  My daughter & I both like Indian movies which she first brought one to my attention.  No doubt that it is so similar to the ""Helen Keller"" story but what I find and like Indians movies add something extra to stories that are similar to others. I always find an unexpected surprise or a little different twist to those stories. I think this is why I keep watching Indian movies.
 The two main actors are great but Rani Murkerjee just out did herself in this one. From the first time watching her in a movie I liked her from the start. I will buy most movies she is in and I have.  I know of the many known bigwig Indian actors I like them as well. Ms. Rani Murkerjee is truly a wonderful actress in my view and can handle her business.",1314403200,4,793,4.197368421052632
2256907,5,B00081MWRA,"Bought it for a friend in US, a first bollywood film for her.
One of the best from the best director with one of the greatest actors ever. Most probably Amitabh Bachchan's finest performance and I'm sure he'd agree. No singing or dancing in this one but a well directed, acted and scripted film. Even the musical score is brilliant.

Would recommend this to newbies and veterans of Bollywood, although I doubt some of the elder generation will appreciate this as they will call it an 'art' film (no singing or dancing).

The young girl in it is unbelievably good, I'm sure she has a bright future.

The only down side is some of the translation into English is not always spot on, a problem with most Bollywood films but it will not distract you from the fine film - so buy it.",1314057600,2,777,4.419580419580419
2256908,5,B00081MWRA,this is one of the most beautiful and inspiring movie that I saw lately. I highly recommend it!,1262217600,3,95,4.333333333333333
2256909,5,B00081MWRA,"This film demonstrates Indian movies at its best. The theme is painful, a blind-deaf girl. But this films goes a long way above the American ""The Miracle Worker"". This is truly a masterpiece. The setting, the music, the performances undoubtly deserve an Oscar. Both actresses who play the child and adult girl and her teacher (Amithab Bachchan) performances are so moving, combining violent and tender scenes that no words could describe their talent. Each nuance in this delicate film is superb. It is one of the most outstanding masterpieces in film I've ever seen.",1252195200,11,567,5.042553191489362
2256910,5,B00081MWRA,"I'm as mentally tough and emotionally stunted as they come. I use humor or some other mechanism to avoid feeling a genuine emotion when watching films. I watched ""Black"" alone late at night. At one point in the second half of the film I said out loud softly, ""Oh, my, god"" and broke down with no one there to see me. It was real.  I watched it again the following evening with my wife who was seeing it for the first time. She started crying way before it did, the wimp.

When watching this film one will realize that (except for one important moment) sometimes the characters express things out loud knowing full well that Michelle cannot hear. This is done so you know what the characters are thinking. Also there is communication directly with Michelle by the characters (aside from what is said during signing) where the labor of communication is abbreviated and Michelle understands. This is a skillfully used mechanism to enhance the flow of the film.  Bravo, Rani!  Bravo Amitabh!  Bravo Ayesha and everyone else who had anything to do with the making of this amazing film.",1245715200,19,1080,4.663157894736842
2256911,4,B00081MWRA,"The movie is beautifully made and the story is interesting and full of emotional content. The acting can be so convincing that one wonders if the main character is acting or if she actually suffers from the portrayed condition. The only problem is the quality of the translation in the subtitles, although I can only speak for the Spanish version which is the one I used.
All in all, this is definitely a film I recommend strongly to anyone.",1242604800,7,441,4.594936708860759
2256912,5,B00081MWRA,"I am a Southasian film nut...this is no Bollywood film.  This is one of the best films to come out of India.  It is Cinematically one of the best films made in a very long time.
It would be silly to suggest that one should not see the immediate reference to the Miracle Worker - Helen Keller's story...but one should definately be pleased with the creative departure taken by the writer and director of this great film, to go beyond and tell a deeper story. Expression is the key to this story and how Michelle is able to express her feelings both happy and sad, her angst both deep and low, her frustration high and tense is amazingly beautiful to watch. Some people I know who can speak, hear and see don'thave such an ability.
The relationship between Michelle and her Teacher is so close and so intimate she can see and hear him and he can hear her...without a single word being exchanged. I love this story as it develops. Where the teacher initially reaches in to pull Michelle out of her darkness, in the end Michelle will reach in to pull him out.  I don't want to say more than that because it would spoil the story.  See this movie if you can get your hands on it. The actors are wonderful and add the special touch to making this one of my favorite movies of all time.",1233705600,24,1279,4.316666666666666
2256913,5,B00081MWRA,"This film will leave you breathless. Although some may inadvertently, or consciously even, pass it over thinking it is another take on the Helen Keller story, you will be left moved. The brilliant acting, direction, and shots of the characters will stay with you for a long time.

I highly recommend the soundtrack which is available on the two-disc set. The soundtrack will haunt you; settling in the joy that is within all of us.

If this is your first trip to Bollywood, I wish you well, and know you will be touched, longing to return. This is a perfect first film to be introduced to the actors whom you may then choose to see in their other films.

No American production has even come close to exposing you to this purely raw and brilliant acting; touching you merely by exposing the recognition in each of the characters, invoking empathy, as we all have had people in our lives with qualities that are portrayed by each actor in this film.

The cinematography, both long shot and in the character involved close-up scenes, will leave you weak in the knees.",1229472000,8,1065,4.619047619047619
2256914,5,B00081MWRA,"This movie is superb. The acting by Amitabh Bachchan, Ayesha Kapur and Rani Mukherjee were incredible.  Amitabh Bachchan's character was different than any other movie that I have seen him in and this shows just how versatile his acting ability is.  He is a very seasoned actor and I expected as much.  Ayesha Kapur also did an excellent job portraying the younger Michele.  To see a child act so well amazed me.  But I was most impressed with Rani Mukherjee.  This was totally different than when I saw her in Khabhi Khushi... playing Naina.  Although she was good in that the details of the emotions that she showed were astounding.  She is now one of my favorite actresses!!!!",1153440000,2,679,4.694915254237288
2256915,5,B00081MWRA,"This film is simply one of the finest pieces of cinema to be made anywhere in the world in the last 5 years. That's quite an extraordinary thing to say but then Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'BLACK' is an extraordinary film.

It carries some weighty themes and pulls no punches delivering them. At times the film is harsh and even brutal in it's portryal of the life of a combined deaf and blind woman. Exploring not only the perceptions of those who care for her (parents, nannys, etc.) but the perception of the central character herself Michelle locked in her world of darkness.

Rani Mukherjee underplays the character of Michelle with such skill and believeability you are genuinely shocked when she loses her temper and lashes out. Beautifully supported by Ayesha Kapur, as the young Michelle, who achieves remarkable sympathy with her character. Between the two Actors they achieve a fullness of character rarely seen in cinema today.

The supporting cast of Mother (Shernaz Patel), father (Dhritiman Chater) and her sister who feels left out (Nandana Sen) provide wonderful sub plots weaving in and out of the main theme. The script is sharp, biting, honest, brutal and even amusiing at times, more than a match for any of the best script writers Hollywood can throw at you.

Then into the mix add one alcoholic, eccentric teacher played by Amitabh Bachchan who turns in the performance of his life. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this then the motion picture industry needs to ask serious questions of itself. A craftsman at the height of his powers Amitabh creates a character who is at once terrifying, wonderful and yet with a fragile edge that you feel could snap at any point, which created a meanaceing undercurrent in the early part of the film. Then with a subtlety of pure genius Amitabh completely turns this round over the course of the film to play with our heart strings like the master he is.

The film dialogue is a mix of English and Hindi which brings me to my only gripe. The subtitles are grossly inaccurate in places, which is annoying to English speaking audiences. The curios thing is the words are being spoken in English yet the subtitles are saying something totally different in English, makes you wonder what else has been messed up in the subtitles.

The score can be a little overbearing but is still an excellent score. Despite a dissapointing technical blooper this is still a truly remarkable film and I recommend it to anyone.

'BLACK' strides across the gap between Bollywood and Hollywood and leaves 99% of Hollywood films in it's wake. If you only get out to the cinema once every five years, go see this, it's worth every penny of the entrance fee.",1149638400,3,2688,4.755364806866953
8055269,1,B00081MWRA,"Oh it just hurts me to say what a terrible film this is.  I watched it with English subtitles as I usually do with foreign films.  The first sign that this would be bad was the melodramatic music trying hard to pull the heart strings of the audience, (that never works unless the music is done with subtlety which it is definitely NOT here).  But I continued watching to give it a chance.  Only to find that the actress playing the mother cannot act well at all.  She overdoes every facial expression and gesture to a laughable degree and so does the actor who plays the teacher.  The screenplay is a conglomerate of forced exposition and cheesy dialogue. I have watched some of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's musical scenes and believe he is extremely talented with uniting camera with scenery and costumes, but he doesn't seem to do as well with works such as this that require more subtlety.  This was a real disappointment.  One of the worst films I have ever seen.",1517011200,,962,4.5523255813953485
8055270,5,B00081MWRA,"Does it really need saying? Where ""The Miracle Worker"" started, ""Black"" goes the rest of the way. From the strenuous awakening to deaf-blindness to the weighing of possible solutions to rising against all odds. And of course, going full circle with student and teacher (eventual vice versa/favor-returning moment). Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee and director Sanjay Leela Bansali, to name some, indeed do their jobs; especially with the principal of call-and-respond. An often ignored and dismissed element that western films, and cinema in general, desperately need. And don't think of our main character as the ""Indian Helen Keller"". Keller may have been noted by history as the first blind-deaf person to break through the barriers of lacking sight and sound; but she is not the ""rightful owner"" of every blind-deaf person's achievements. Before or after her. Get with the planet, People. And last time I saw this one (a long time ago), the DVD works fine and dandy. A shoo-in for Best Foreign Film.
