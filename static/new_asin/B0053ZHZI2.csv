4553195,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I saw this movie in the theater on May 28.  It is excellent, and should serve as a wake-up call to all who see it to get their eating-habits act together.  As one who has spent time in the  hospital recovering from congestive heart failure and subsequently converted to a plant-based diet, I can personally attest to the efficacy of Drs. Esselstyn and Campbell's approach.  I am now off all but one of the Meds, and am only continuing with that one because it helps my kidneys repair themselvs from the diabetes damage I inflicted on them with my previous eating habits.  When they have recovered sufficiently, I will be off all meds.

My resting blood pressure (BP) is now in the normal range without meds (typically about 115/70, down from mid 180s/80), no thanks to my cardiologist who was perfectly happy to keep me on three BP medications indefinitely.  My weight is now about 170 lbs, down from over 400 lbs.  My heart ejection fraction is now in the mid 60s, up from 42 when I went into the hospital.  I can now walk an aerobic 5 miles without breathing hard.  My total cholesterol is about 120 with the LDL about 90 and the HDL about 35.

This movie is one everyone should see.  If you let it, it will change your life.",1306713600,478,1227,4.428571428571429

Sooooooooooooooo happy to see that the cookbook is scheduled to be released next month because when I left the Cinema, that's the first thing I wanted!",1306281600,38,214,4.631578947368421
4553197,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This movie combines the scientific and medical work of Dr. T. Colin Campbell, PhD Professor Emeritus in Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University, and Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstlyn, Jr., MD, surgeon at the world-renowed Cleveland Clinic, and the incredibly INSPIRING story of two FORMER heart disease patients and two FORMER diabetes patients.

This movie is POSITIVE, ACCURATE, and HOPEFUL. It is the perfect introduction to the concept of plant-based nutrition, and it offers very attainable role models in the patients to empower people to take their health into their own hands.

There are no segments of tortured animals - just wonderful information, top athletes, and people reversing their chronic disease.

Everyone needs to see this movie!!!!!",1304640000,239,754,5.539130434782609

4553213,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I have this review over on The China Study as well, but it applies here, so I'm not going to re-write another review.  I give this 5 stars, despite the 4 stars I gave to the China Study, because FOK is done incredibly well in terms of making the information easy to understand and assimilate vs. the book.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to others, over the book, with my one caveat included with the recommendation.

My review is also a reply to another commenter named, Liz. I think this is an important point that needs to be lifted above the dust of arguing that has developed around this study. I didn't give it five stars [for the China Study review] because his ""in conclusion"" advice isn't based on his own facts. I've done a lot of reading, watching documentaries, and listening to the opinions offered on this debate, before deciding to finally weigh in with my viewpoint. For what it's worth, here's my observation:

""He [Dr. Campbell] discusses diets that include 10% meat. Pick up any book that looks at the longest living people in the world. Greece, Japan, wherever you find them- they won't be downing red meat and milk at every freaking meal. That is not healthy. But God forbid anybody who suggests this, cuz obviously it'll be a vegetarian conspiracy.""

I think this right here is the problem, and why so many people get frustrated with the recommendations of Dr. Campbell, which are not the result of his own findings.

In his writing, and videos/interviews, Dr. Campbell repeatedly mentions the 5-10% animal protein point at which cancer growth turns off. In Forks Over Knives, this is one of the main points discussed, yet, despite that, and the fact that Dr. Chen, in FOK, also says that a healthy diet includes mostly plants and very little meat, Dr. Campbell bypasses this/his own fact and jumps to recommending a vegan diet. An honest recommendation, based on his own findings, would actually be to recommend a diet of no more than 10% animal food.

When I first watched FOK, this percentage, and Dr. Chen's comment, didn't slip past my notice. I was surprised when the documentary wrapped up this evidence by then saying we should be eating a vegan diet. I pointed out the discrepancy to my husband, and we agreed, instead, to follow the diet based on the actually findings. Based on the evidence, that means a diet consisting of no more than 10% animal products. As others have pointed out, science is always evolving and learning more about food. That 5-10% of animal food may be more crucial to overall well-being and health than is now understood. So, based on the China Study, and Dr. Campbell's and Dr. Chen's findings, we are keeping that 5-10% animal food in our diet. Just as ""more is better"" isn't true with animal food, ""more is better"" isn't automatically true with a plant based diet. Based on the available evidence at this point, it may very well be that a 90-95% plant based and 5-10% animal based diet is the ""sweet spot"". This is the point, based on the evidence at hand, that so many people seem to be overlooking - elective dismissal based on personal/ethical beliefs, an honest oversight of the fact, etc.

I think Dr. Campbell has provided us with invaluable information, and has brought our diet out of the dark ages, but I don't think there would be so much arguing over non-facts if people, including Dr. Campbell, stuck with the evidence and findings of these studies instead of providing personal opinions/beliefs as a conclusion; this includes those individuals outright dismissing the study/Dr. Campbell, because of Dr. Campbell's discrepancy. They are just as guilty of overlooking the evidence and offering their own opinion/belief on the other end of the spectrum.",1525737600,,3730,4.790046656298601

I lent out my copy and never got it back so I bought another one to put it back in my library because it is one I will watch over and over and over.

I want everybody to go vegan and reverse their diseases and not go on meds or have surgeries.

The vegan studies of people getting off their diabetes meds in 14 days and reversing heart disease in a year and even reversing Cancer are astoundingly brilliant realities.

Eating like this every single day for the rest of your life might be a bit of a test, but if you are diabetic, obese, or suffer from heart problems, this might very well be a least one answer to your immediate health challenges.  And the two gentlemen who developed this are not some tree-hugging quacks but highly respected leaders in heart surgery and nutritional science, respectively.

4553258,4,B0053ZHZI2,"The pro-vegan arguments, studies and statistics (like the china study and the Norway war time statistic) are very interesting. But the few testimonies of people improving their health or curing illnesses, no matter if they were 100% true or not, doesn't sound very convincing due to their small number and the way it's presented; they don't show enough medical testing and results and show too much of the patients simply telling how healthier they feel; sometimes it felt like the types of testimonies people give when they think they've been cured by some miracle from god. I wouldn't show this film to friends or family members if I wanted to convince them veganism is good. It might make veganism seems like a crazy cult and scare them off more than anything.",1520208000,,763,4.8320610687022905
4553259,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Put simply, this film proves beyond any doubt that humans are plant eaters.
If we eat anything else we are significantly less healthy physically and mentally.

It is a scandle as big as the tobacco industry that fish, meat, eggs, dairy and sugar products are freely available in our supermarkets.
They should have health warning labels on them and be age restricted same as tobacco and alcohol. NOT promoted as part of a healthy balances diet. THEY ARE NOT.

These provide the essential vitamins and minerals that we all need and they lessen the dangerous fats that clog our arteries. The way that our food comes to us
is also important. What a better world it would be all around if we stopped the terrible cruelty that we put animals through, by slaughtering them for our food. Big agriculture has crueler methods than ever before.  Animal based foods only cause us more health problems in the long run: heart disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and a host of other health related problems. We could reverse these diseases by eating a healthier plant based diet.  We could also stop the pollution of our environment if we got our food from plants rather than animals.",1504137600,,848,4.761904761904762
4553321,1,B0053ZHZI2,"Just came across as an anti-meat commercial IMO.  I think our bigger issue is all the non-foods we eat that are high in hydrogenated oils, preservatives and ingredients no one can pronounce. Even foods that don't need to be sweet are loaded with corn syrup. I would recommend That Sugar Film, which I think everyone can benefit from. It does a much better job of explaining the link between sugar/corn syrup consumption and poor health.

I also found it interesting that they kept showing old nutrition education films from the 1950s, and we didn't even have an obesity problem in this country until low-fat/high carb diets became all the rage for health & weight loss in the 1980s.",1503705600,6,682,4.771186440677966

4553341,4,B0053ZHZI2,"Overall, Forks Over Knives is a slightly better-than-average documentary film but its message is so imperative that this should be compulsory viewing for everyone. Amassing a staggering collection of statistics and studies, spanning decades and multiple geographical locations, two doctors, one a nutritional scientist and the other a heart surgeon,  prove the benefits of a whole foods, plant based diet. No dairy, no meat, and no processed foods. They argue and prove that natural products in their unprocessed state, not only combats all the major diseases but has the power to reverse and even, completely eradicate.

Among the many frightening revelations is that animal protein, which is the staple diet for most people, has an innate ability to turn on cancer cells. The film also sheds light on some of the political ties of the animal product industries and illustrates why governments discard and even ignore the findings of this landmark research.

I suspect that the film might come across as preachy and somewhat impractical to people who strongly believe that animal protein is essential for human life, but will certainly prove difficult to ignore when presented with the cold hard facts. To an impartial individual, this just might save their life.",1499126400,,1264,5.247524752475248

I actually got mad at him. A colonoscopy was scheduled, sleep apnea test and a visit to the nutritionist were ordered. I lost a father and three brothers to renal failure and diabetes AND LIVED FOR SALT AND RED MEAT AND RICH DESERTS.Right away I was offered all kinds of stuff to help support my downward spiral-even the dietitian was just about to start on another caloried diet when I asked 2 questions- can this be reversed and can I stop the medicine? She suggested this documentary. I didn't need more convincing. The writing was on the wall. Everyday I had three spectacular hrs when I ate whatever I wanted and then 21 miserable one as I lugged along an out of shape body, stiff joints and cramping muscles. Three days after starting I was walking upright, moving more fluidly  and not taking diabetic or blood pressure meds. I opted for 3 miserable hrs and 21 fabulous ones. It turned out I quickly adjusted to the veges, fruits. nuts,seeds and grain and didn't feel nearly as deprived as I had thought. I even consulted with long time veges and got some great simple recipes. I check in with my dietician to be sure I am getting the B12, calcium, protein etc that I need. I monitored my  pressure and glucose twice a day at home without even a hint of it going outside of normal-go figure.

4553455,2,B0053ZHZI2,"I'm not a vegan and have heard a lot of evidence against it (from researchers, scientists & doctors) as a long-term healthy option for most people.  But I've also heard many vegans reference this video, and wanted to make sure there isn't something I'm unaware of, that should make me consider this way of eating. There was nothing in this movie to convince me otherwise. I could poke so many holes in their arguments, it's not even funny.  Yes, going from the standard American diet of unhealthy fats, conventional meats, and a whole lot of sugar and processed carbs, to a whole foods vegan diet, is going to be a major improvement, thus the great results many have in the beginning. But it's not the animal products that are causing the problems, it's the other components (vegetable/corn oil, junky carbs, and lots of sugar).  I've had results equally as impressive as the people in this movie by switching to a ketogenic diet, which is very low carb (no grains, potatoes, sugar, and very little fruit) but lots of veggies, high fat (grass-fed butter, coconut oil, avocados, nuts), and a moderate amount of protein (pastured eggs and chicken, grass-fed beef).  I'm 14 months keto, and still very happy with this way of eating.  My whole family (husband, kids, my mom & sister, and my best friend) have all lost weight, reduced meds, and improved their health by eating this way, so it's not just me. I do appreciate the aspect of not wanting to hurt animals, that is at the root of the vegan philosophy, but still believe some animal products are required for most humans to have optimal health.",1477267200,5,1598,4.71326164874552

Several of my students, largely in part due to this video, have decided to take a closer look at what they eat and move to a healthier diet. If you, or someone you care about, is inflicted by heart disease, obesity, diabetes, or several types of cancer, this is an excellent way to introduce them to the concept of diet as medicine.

If meat and dairy is what kills people how can the health in Mediterranean countries can be explains?
I m from Italy, I come in U.S. as an adult and never adopted the American way of eating, meaning, i eat pasta (not drown in rich sauces) vegetables, lots of fruit,whole crusty bread,cheese and meat in moderation, meaning not everyday and not the portions you see in American plates. And dessert only for special occasion. Even soda for me as a kid was a reward to be enjoyed in summer,and the choice was soda or ice cream, not both and not everyday.
My grandmother was french, she consumed lot of butter, meat and cheese, and she did not have high blood pressure or heart problems.
Personally I never read a study that proves cholesterol is related to heart disease.
Of the 5 place in the word ,where people have the longest rate of longevity, one is rural Sardinia, any of you that have been there know the diet is mainly sheep. Meat, cheese and wine are definitely consume in large quantities. Yet they don't seem to have the health related problems we have here in America.
In  Okinawa, the place with highest longevity on Earth, people love their pork.
In Europe, in the Mediterranean regions, you started to see the issue that we have here, now the younger generation are adopting the American way of eating.
When i grow up, i didn t know a single person that was obese.
I think the main issue in America is the size of portion and refined sugar, kids start their day with over sweetened cereal, there is definitely a sugar abundance in American diet.
With wealth came over abundance of food, together with people having desk jobs, sitting in cars instead of walking, all these factor contribute the the poor health of America. Not to mention the pollution.
How we feed and grow our animals, cows grow on grain when their natural food is grass,animals been fed antibiotic because the unnatural condition they grow.
Maybe, just maybe that is why eating to much meat,according to these gentlemen, can be directly link to cancer.
And unless you eat organic from an organic farm, i bet lot of poisons( pesticides, stuff to make the depleted soil continuing producing, waxes to make the fruit and veggie look pretty) and nutrition deficient veggies ends up on our plates
.How can vegetables and fruits not allowed to ripen on the plant, frozen,and full of chemicals consume out of season be healthy?

My point is, sure we should all follow a good nutrition plan, there is no one magic food. Staying healthy doesn t depend on one factor,but many .

And it would be great if stopping consuming meat with stop the deforestation of rain forest and other places on Earth, but truth is, the human population is growing, and a lot of places on Earth get stripped on natural habitat to make room for farm land.",1474070400,3,2850,4.650793650793651

I am on board to start this tomorrow.  I just heard of a friend who died a couple of days ago.  His diet was horrendous with lots of meat, sugar and dairy.  As he was only about 8 years older than me and I'm going to be 57 next week, it's time to switch my diet.  This was a great movie that gave me tons of wonderful information.  It also made me think about how we treat animals, although the movie did not focus on that aspect.

4553518,1,B0053ZHZI2,"I am a triple-degreed scientist and I know bad science when I see it.  This movie contains numerous fallacies, scientific inaccuracies, and glaring omissions.  The movie makers, so eager to demonize animal protein, make no mention of the myriad of health benefits that come from eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, etc. and conveniently omit discussion of the health benefits whey protein which is the other major protein component of milk along with the much-demonized casein.  Speaking of which, the ""science"" used in the movie to bash casein is laughably bad when you consider that aflatoxin-riddled rats fed low doses of casein mostly died of malnutrition and toxic effects instead of tumors.  It is hard to grow a tumor when you don't even have enough protein to make normal cells.

The one positive from the movie is the recommendation to eat more fruits and veggies and less processed, fat and sugar-laden fast food fare.  I think we can all agree on this.

 Others have pointed out then myriad of other falsehoods in this movie.  If you are looking for a facts-be-damned feel good movie about veganism then by all means buy this movie and enjoy the ride, it is good entertainment.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for a non-biased scientific discussion of health and nutrition then look elsewhere.",1471824000,24,1320,4.905405405405405

4553545,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I've watched many whole foods/plant-based diet documentaries, and so many of them are full of psuedo-scientific babbling that is more akin to motivational speaking than they are to a frank discussion of the clinical evidence resulting from large-scale scientific research over the last two decades. Evidence that unequivocally implicates the consumption of animal products (meat, eggs, dairy) as the culprit responsible for the leading causes of death in the western world: Cancer, Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Disease, all major diseases of inflammation, etc. You can turn these disease on and off like the tap in clinical studies by simply putting people on plant based diets.

Peer-reviewed scientific research strongly supports a shift to a vegan diet if health is a concern, and this knowledge is nothing new. All large-scale diet studies point to meat consumption and processed foods as the cause of the health crises faced in developed countries, and the same studies find that an increased intake of whole fruits and vegetables works as the best path of treatment. It's so refreshing to see a documentary that brings this evidence into the light of day and respects the intelligence of its viewers to actually understand the research and its power to cure the epidemics ravaging our loved-ones and health care systems.

The bottom line is that if the body is acidic, it's prone for dis-eases. If the body of alkaline, it fights dis-eases. A vegan diet is the way to go.

I had a malfunction in my blood that doctors said I would never get rid off, but then I understood that the hospitals make money by keeping people alive... And sick... If they were to cure everyone, their business would go down A LOT. I didn't lose hope but I was on the search for answers. A friend of mine filled me in on this documentary, on people like Dr. Sebi (look him up), and on Medical Certified Water machine (read about it on ""H2Owonder.com"") and after months of pain and sufferings, I was able to have a full detox of my blood at a molecular level.

You would be surprised how many people WANT to eat this way but don't know how. Take it a step at a time if you need to. I've been working on it (giving up things one at a time as I find out what it's actually doing to me) for several years now AND I DON'T bash myself if I eat something I shouldn't... I simple made a rule I can't bring it in my house. I can eat a piece of cake at a restaurant but not the whole thing in my house. That's helped so much. Also shop once or twice a month.

I just finished watching Forks Over Knives, which I borrowed from my clinic, and am now determined to change the way I eat! There is so much information, good information contained in the 96 minutes that I am on Amazon and purchasing a copy not only for myself and my husband, but for my daughter, son and sister! I plan to also purchase the cookbook and the plan on HOW to transition.

Once I receive the books I will give this way of eating an eight week try and report back on how well I benefited from the change in what I eat. Not having yet received the books, I don't know if 2 months is a sufficient amount of time to see benefit; I might have to adjust that, but I am so hopeful that I can reverse the damage I've done to my body through overeating and being sedentary. Wish me luck and I'll ""see"" you in a couple of months.",1452297600,,994,4.2592592592592595

You believe what you want to believe because you want to keep doing what you're doing - point blank. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, of course. This is America after all, we can say what we want (ostensibly) and feel what we feel (until it offends).  What's true is that a lot of the foods that are shoved down our throats and advertised are not good for us. Breads have additives that are not good, meats are littered with nitrites and all kinds of rubbish, even some of the vegetables are being toyed with.  We are an obese nation DYING in record numbers. I have never seen so much stomach cancer, color cancer, pancreatic cancer, diabetes...in my life. The diets promoted in Forks Over Knives calls for a radical change in the way that most of us have learned to eat.  Of course you can't just east salad and carrots. You have to get your nutrients in a cornucopia of ways -- beans, fruits, veggies, etc.  I personally have a lot of sick folks in my family. They are dying and something needs to change. There is not one magic panacea. But this is a fantastic step, the push that many folks need.  Yes it could have been more entertaining. But I'll tell you what - there is nothing entertaining about premature and unnecessary death. Great information in this film to get you started on a new path to better health. If you didn't like the film, then do your own research and make your own movie refuting everything you heard and provide a better alternative to saving lives...that is unless you are a lobbyist for the food and pharmaceutical industries.

I am continuing to reduce my weight, have lowered my cholesterol significantly to healthy levels, and have returned to perfect glucose levels (92-100 fasting)  mostly following the diet outlined in the video, and my multiple doctors all tell me I'm better off, now that I'm following this lifestyle (diet AND EXERCISE).

If you don't believe vegetarian/vegan diet,  you'll be able to make enough excuses to continue with your current meat/dairy diet and lifestyle and not notice any problems for years, but around age 40-45, it will begin to catch up, and I hope you will remember the messages this video presents and reconsider.

I just thought it was genetics and a role of the dice that determined if you went to the hospital.  Not so. We really do control our health through eating but the food industry and the marketing practices of the food industry and the government that tries to help and assist the food industry ALL LEAD US DOWN THE WRONG PATH.  After you view this documentary you will see the hidden agenda and hidden truth that you have actually seen every day and is right in front of your eyes and that you already know!  You can't deny it because you already know it, now you will HAVE to act on your knowledge. How can you not?  This documentary takes all the knowledge you already have and just brings all the facts to the forefront for you to ingest at one time.

These topics just can't be emphasized enough.  Responsibility for the health of our society is not a one-sided thing, responsibility lies in many areas, from our parents and schools up to the food industry, health care industry and our government.  I did not agree with 100% of what was said, maybe 95%.  I am not a vegan, was for a couple of years, it didn't suit me.  That's a choice we all have to make for ourselves.  Eating meat is not a necessity in today's diet, we know of many other foods now that contain plenty of protein.  I do believe eating meat comes with risks and also responsibilities.  I choose to only eat meat once or twice a week.  I attempt to eat only that which has been raised and made available by humane means.  If it was all gone tomorrow, I could be vegan again.  I would not starve and I would still have a variety of foods to choose from.  The biggest help for our animals, our planet and our health is getting the correct  information out there, over and over and over.  It has to become ubiquitous and prolific.

I do not eat any animal products and started this because of the ways in which animals are treated, however I noticed a change in how I was feeling. I could not explain it to my husband in the detailed, specific way he was needing in order to understand, but this movie did it for him. And it made me more confident in my decision to become a vegan. We really enjoyed how the documentary showed individuals from different socioeconomic classes practicing a plant-based, animal-free diet and the effects it had on their health and life. This proved that this lifestyle is possible for anyone to adopt. If you have not made the decision to reduce the amount of animal product in your diet, do not let that discourage you from watching this film. There is plenty of useful information mentioned that applies to meat-eaters, vegans and all in between. Be open minded and take what you will from this documentary. Hopefully you will be inspired like my family was.
PS: There is not a lot of footage about animal cruelty in this documentary. As I mentioned, the reason I first became a vegan was due to animal rights, but I am not the type of person who can sit and watch a video that show graphic images. I know what happens, I don't ignore it, but I cannot comfortably sit and watch it.

4553876,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I love Forks Over Knifes (2011) and this is one of the BEST EVER documentary I have watched in my entire life. I recommend this move for every living human being, I mean it.

Why should a Hospital-Pharmaceutical-Doctor cure you of your illness or make you a healthy human being, when their whole livelihood depends upon making you chronically ill, and then trying to keep you alive with drugs, surgeries and procedures.

The most important aspect of Our Life Style and associated Health-Wellness should always be our #1 concern. Unfortunately, the same is distorted by media, healthcare professionals, marketing & advertisements, business interests and in the end protectors become preachers in disguise. This move gives me a fresh prospective about ""my life and my health"" in a well documented, neatly referred and informed manner.

Also must read is China Study, if you are more statistically inclined person. Preventive maintenance of health is so uscapitalistic and against the commercialization of entire insurance driven healthcare system of the western world.

I have seen so much good for me that I am NOT going back to my old habits and lifestyle. Watch the movie :-) you will fall in love with the concepts and common sense approach which we had lost due to white-washing by propaganda of business/industry.",1440633600,2,1317,5.111627906976744

4553886,3,B0053ZHZI2,"The problem I have with this film is that it only discusses diet in terms of one extreme or the other. Of course people will be unhealthy if they consume large amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, salt, and cholesterol.  The recommended amount of foods daily for a 2000 kcal diet is actually pretty modest (5 1/2 ounces of protein foods is often exceeded daily). Moving to a 100% plant based diet is of course going to be healthier than what is typically consumed, but the film doesn't discuss several problems that can occur with a vegan diet over time: B12 deficiency, iron deficiency, and sources of essential fatty acids NOT found in plant foods, just to name a few.

If the rats that received 5% of their diet in the form of casein did not develop cancer, and the countries studied that did not consume large amounts of meat also did not develop cancer in high rates, wouldn't it seem right to promote eating LESS meat and dairy, instead of none at all?

It bothers me that a balanced diet with the inclusion of meat and dairy received no focus when trying to get the patients featured in the film to healthy levels. I think there needs to be more exploration in this regard before making the claim that meat and dairy are 100% unhealthy.",1439856000,5,1246,4.528888888888889

These legal fictions are immortal; however, real people, natural persons must eat in order to live. All too many of us have been sickened by the foods we've been told are good for us. Forks Over Knives provides information by which any person may liberate herself/himself from the propaganda and from the illnesses that are guaranteed effects of the Standard American Diet (SAD). Ironically, the big corporations are now doing to the Chinese populace what they've long been doing to Americans' beliefs.

4554021,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This presentation does a very good job with research and clinical results to buttress the argument that the western diet is nutritionally poor and vitamin deficient. Another set of doctors has left the ranks of the masses in the medical field to expose the elephant in the room. When diets are high in carbohydrates, animal products (meat) including dairy, sugar overload and sodium the results are overweight, obese and a chronically ill population. In countries where the food is primarily plant based, unaltered by antibiotic treatments, preservatives, and hybrid manipulation things common in our country do not exist in theirs. Hypertension (high blood pressure), cancer, diabetes, and kidney failure, to name a few increase more and more as the western diets are increased in these places.

4554174,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Excellent eye opening show. I wish I had watched long ago.
It's kind of funny but about 25 years ago when I had 480 cholesterol and 1800 triglycerides along with being 75 pounds overweight the doctor gave me 3 choices.
1) I could keep going the way I was and live a very short time.
2) I could keep going the way I was, take a lot of pills and live a while longer.
3) I could lose a lot of weight, take a few pills and live a long time.
Since I had very little money #3 was the best choice. I lost 75 pounds but didn't go veggie but I can see now that would have been the way to go but I have cheated the Grim Reaper for quite awhile and have never had a heart attack but I sure was close.
Looks a few more changes are in order to improve my diabetes readings. No insulin yet but I am excited about ever being on it.",1425254400,,816,3.8058823529411763

You are not going to get cancer or die young if you put creamer in your coffee, eat one egg/month, one piece of fish/month, and two pieces of chicken/month. And the SAD is not too many eggs, too much chicken and too much fish. It's too much bread, pasta, cereal, cookies, pretzels and potato chips.

STOP THE VEGAN NONSENSE. If you don't like using animals for food, that fine. I have no problem with that. But please don't justify it with bogus health claims and selective studies of a certain group of people.

And the China Study is crap. From Wiki - "" It looked at mortality rates from cancer and other chronic diseases from 1973-75 in 65 counties in China."" That's just great. This took place when China was still communist, and the people barely had enough to eat. Is that what we should do, go on a borderline starvation/90% rice diet?",1422057600,6,879,4.453416149068323

What a blessing to have such powerful scientific evidence that proves that God's way is the best way in all things....even concerning our diet!  Think about it...there was no butcher in the Garden of Eden and there will be no butcher in heaven....those who say humans must consume meat to be healthy need to take it up with God because as soon as meat was permitted by God to eat after the flood when all the vegetation was destroyed the lifespan of man went from about 800-900 years to about 120 within a few generations!

4554435,3,B0053ZHZI2,"This was an interesting documentary and I agree with the basic premise that the Standard American Diet (SAD) is atrocious. However, I was very disappointed that they never once differentiated between industrial, CAFO meats and organic, pastured meats. They also didn't differentiate between organic and GMO vegetables. You health results will be dramatically different in each case, which research appears to support; e.g., the Seralini study.

I agree with another reviewer that the premise of the film that all vegetables all the time is the best diet for everyone is false. The Institute in Integrative Nutrition refers to the concept of ""bio-individuality"", meaning, not all diets will work for everyone all the time. Treating acute conditions may require a different diet than prevention or maintenance. Also, the China Study has some serious flaws in its methodology and conclusions. See ""Death by Food Pyramid"" by Denise Minger for a comprehensive analysis of the study. Hint: she eviscerates the conclusions.

The film exposes the conflict of interest between the government and industrial food interests but only offers ""all veggies all the time"" as an alternative. As Michael Pollan has said, (I forget which book), ""Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants"". The operative word being ""mostly"".",1410393600,,1306,5.365853658536586
4554436,5,B0053ZHZI2,"To be honest, I have avoided this movie since it came out because I did not want to make drastic changes in my diet.  Then last week I (a 60 year old healthy female) had a heart attack.  My doctor recommended seeing the movie and making serious changes (""This is what I would do if I were you,"" he said.)
I watched the movie tonight, and although it is primarily about eating a plant based diet, it is so much more.  There are at least 3 good case studies of people who were helped by doctors who prescribe this diet, data from various countries (especially China), and how the food industry send consumers inaccurate messages about protein and diary products.
The movie is a must see for anyone with any form of heart disease, but is important for all who are concerned with justice issues related to food consumption.",1410307200,,819,4.483221476510067
4554437,2,B0053ZHZI2,"Although it did serve to encourage me to eat more plant foods (I grow my own and shop at a food co-op), I thought it poorly considered and omitted many of the factors that make for good nutrition.  It failed to determine that the diet they recommend is one that all can thrive on, there being many factors in an individual's metabolic make up that would make them healthy or not.  One of the great problems is factory food that have contributed to our epidemic of chronic disease and factory farming that contributes to the lack of many important minerals and nutrients in food.  And using only a partial component of protein (casein, from milk while not stating whether or not it was organic) to determine a rat's likelihood of getting liver cancer is poor science at best and shameless at the least.  I am sorry this is such a poor vehicle for consumer education.  I hope other viewers pick up these deficiencies and seek a better source for their education.",1410307200,,960,4.590643274853801

4554454,5,B0053ZHZI2,"What I appreciated about this film was it's appeal, and offer of empowerment to the individual. The appeal was to at least try eating a whole foods plant-based diet, and see how it works for you. The empowerment came from bucking the system, taking responsibility, and determining what is best YOU and YOUR health, instead of the central planners in DC. The filmmakers went about trying to persuade the viewer as to why they should try such a diet. Unlike other films, this one didn't have a strong ""angst"" about it, or a ""foaming-at-the-mouth"" radical tone, and I thought the persons interviewed on both sides of the argument were quite professional and/or qualified and were represented respectfully (even though it was obvious who's side the filmmakers were on).

The overall message is that if people wish to be healthier, they must eat a diet consisting of whole natural foods. There seems to be  little doubt or disagreement that such food can be excellent medicine for a body that is wracked with ailments. Overall, people are eating WAY too much heavily processed foods, and are being drugged to death. The system is biased, bloated and broken.

The parting of the ways the film illustrates is when one of the two groups goes completely without animal products, and the other stands firm and continues consuming dairy, meat and poultry. The result is the two groups waging an epic conflict (an ever escalating, noisy, confusing and hostile affair I might add) as to the future of which will finally be victorious.

Personally, I find this attitude of ""either we stick with animal products, or totally kick them out of our diets"" to be rather silly and ignorant of the differences in the composition of people's bodies. With some, the plant based diet just doesn't work for an unknown reason and feel best when they have small to moderate amounts of animal products. For others, it makes a huge difference eliminating meat and dairy. Either way, if people are becoming healthier and enjoying their lives more, let them be. Don't antagonize them or force them to adapt to how you think they should live. If you do that, you're no better than a fascist (I'm waggling my finger at BOTH sides when I say this).

I've eaten meat and diary my entire life and have decided, of my own free will, to give such a diet a chance and give up animal products. If it improves my life and health (which I strongly suspect it will), excellent. If not, no harm no foul, and I'll go back to consuming small to moderate amounts of animals. Don't get me wrong, I love all creatures (although the ones that would try and kill me I love considerably less) and abhor the way they are treated in processing plants. But I certainly don't place them at the level of a human being (if its my wife or the cat . . . sorry kitty) Animals should be treated well, after all they were placed under us humans for us to take good care of. Sure we can eat them, but it may, or may not be the best thing for our health. One argument for a plant based diet could be that just because you could be a cannibal, doesn't mean you should. Just because we can eat meat, doesn't necessarily mean its the best thing for us.

This film was inspiring and informative. Sure it has it's biases of which I was fully aware of (global warming for example, LOL!), but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have it's good points; and I would recommend it to carnivores, omnivores and herbivores alike. :)",1409356800,2,3451,4.585089141004862

For long term, people need to inform themselves about root causes of ""bad"" high cholesterol, and address those.  (Ex:  eating beef from cattle confined in feed lots, loaded w/ antibiotics, eating GMO corn etc.)  The meat/fat from these animals is high in Omega 6 fats, which is at the root of cardiovascular problems, according to much recent research.  ""Clean Meat"" from free range, grass fed cows is properly balanced between Omega 6 and Omega 3's,  the healthy, good fats.  Same goes for chickens and eggs.  Best to slowly incorporate lots of vegetables - mostly raw, steamed or stir fried in healthy oils (not Canola) and increase your fruit intake.  We need to go back to the way people ate 100 years ago, when there were no deaths due to clogged arteries, i.e. ""heart attacks"".  Also, please watch the DVD ""Food, Inc"" - a very well done documentary which explains why multitudes are so sick w/ preventable diseases.",1409184000,6,1030,4.795454545454546

Do yourself a favor and go to a whole foods plant based diet.

I also am doing plant based because after seeing Gary Yourofsky's Best Speech Ever and Earthlings on youtube about the abject cruelty to the  animals that become our food and the way the meat dairy and egg industry commercially produces these animals like they were so much garbage you will want to go to those farms and ring those peoples necks with the careless brutality inflicted on innocent beings.

4554499,1,B0053ZHZI2,"I wish I could have rated this movie a quarter of one star because the overbearing theme of this movie was ridiculous.  Meat (red, white, fish, poultry, and nuts in one lead character's view) is not the health demon of our society which is what this movie is shouting to any who will listen.  If this were true, the history of our species would have been quite different.  Being introduced to many old but extensive health studies from other countries, it appeared that the introduced information was manipulated to its preconceived theory of meat being the root of all health evil.  Simple research provided multiple dissenters of its medical and statistical claims and negligible supporters.  I agree with the basic concept of eating more ""whole"" plant food and less processed food but that doesn't translate to the vilification of all other food groups.  I did appreciate the personal stories of those few individuals who have taken on the vegan food lifestyle and how it helped them overcome their infirmities and improved their lives.  In fact, if the movie was simply about these individuals, I believe  it would have been more persuasive to others; rather, it spent an enormous amount of time establishing the credentials of the main medical characters - those who have literature for sale as presented at the end of the movie - and used anecdotal scarce tactics for persuasion.  It wasn't worth the money I spent or the time I viewed it.",1407024000,9,1445,4.865306122448979

We support kind treatment of animals as well, but we do not eat them or their eggs or milk products. Still, when I go to a restaurant, I ask for ""Vegan"" food.

KNIVES - refers to the surgeon's knife - which you can avoid, by using your FORKS to eat a WFPB diet.

T. Colin Campbell is the author of THE CHINA STUDY, available through Amazon also.

This is the classic epidemiological study in China, which statistically related diet to disease.

4554544,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This documentary prevents a very compelling case for adopting a plant-based diet.  Dr. T. Colin Campbell, PhD Professor Emeritus in Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University, and Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstlyn, Jr., MD, surgeon at the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, are both extremely fit, dynamic, older men who live the principles of eating that they espouse. While completely giving up all animal products - meat, fish, chicken, pork, eggs, cheese and other dairy products, is not something I think I could do, I can certainly eat plant-based foods exclusively several days a week. Though my cholesterol, blood pressure and glucose are all within normal levels, it's getting harder and harder to fight the ""battle of the bulge"", and I'm certain that giving up or minimizing the calorie-dense animal products will help me win the battle.

The film is well researched and presented, with just enough science to be convincing, without being too technical. The main selling point of the theory is the dramatically improved lives of the people featured in the film. Not only were they able to lose weight and regain their health, they were able to turn back the debilitating effects of heart disease and diabetes and get off the medications. The cost savings to individuals and society in general of improved health is incalculable.

I've gone vegetarian a couple of times, years ago, and found my mood was calmer and I had tons more energy -- I just joined my wife on this eating plan, as she has high cholesterol and cannot take statins -- two weeks and we've both lost weight, sleep better, and don't get that ""crash"" after eating a heavy meal or sugar treat.

Now I hear I need never eat another morsel of dead animal flesh to be healthy and live a long life!  This documentary blew my mind!  I am either confused or in denial.  Probably both!

Now, how to unlearn a lifetime of different information and habit?!",1402790400,,392,4.5285714285714285
4554585,3,B0053ZHZI2,"I loved the original Forks Over Knives. The two main doctors featured in that movie have expanded dialogue, which is fine. There are other featured personnel that were not used in the movie and you will need to judge their comments on their own merits.

My main issue with the movie is that they chose to daisy-chain each interview without the use of a moderator. A splash screen would pose a topic that the interviewed doctor, nutritionist, or other professional would talk about. I dozed off a couple of times and had to go and replay portions of it. I think the effect of having one voice talk without a different voice as an interlude added to the droning effect of the movie.

Also, I thought Forks Over Knives avoided much proselytizing and cynicism that many of these types of documentaries often have. The extended interviews is another story. Be prepared for many themes along the lines of a) Big Business is influencing government agencies for purely profit motives, b) many medical studies supporting plant based diets are hidden from the public, c) food companies are using psychological warfare to make you consume unhealthy foods, and d) most doctors are recommending medical procedures over prevention because it's good for their business.  There are compelling arguments to support these notions to a degree, but there is a lot of personal responsibility involved too. If we eat unhealthy, we can't blame the outside forces trying to sell a product. All businesses have a profit motive, including many of these interviewees with their healthy programs.

What is clearly missing is the steady progression of evidence to suggest how a plant-based diet improves health and is worth the sacrifice of ending a standard western diet. In fact, there is more pseudo-science, mainly by the new people in this film. Dr. McDougal, the doctor that promotes a starch and vegetable diet, talks about how oils suppress the auto-immune systems throughout your body. I wasn't able to find an appreciable amount of evidence to support this. There are many plant-based foods with natural oils that are beneficial. Excessive oils and fats are obviously unhealthy, but to end the consumption of them completely doesn't seem warranted.

I'm not bashing a plant-based diet. In fact, Fork Over Knives was a pivotal reason I decided to switch a couple of months ago. I've lost weight and feel better, but it is still too early to see the improved effects on blood pressure and cholesterol (doctor's appt next month!). I think they can make a case without sounding like a conspiracy theorist's wet dream. By the end of the movie, I had the impression that there was more messaging to compel the viewer to go to a vegan diet because the evil forces out their want you to not eat a plant-based diet, rather than promoting the plant-based diet on its own merits.

It isn't a bad movie by any stretch. It was pretty dry to watch and seemed to go on and on. Make sure you are doing something at the same time to break up the monotony.

Quick note (9/30/14). After three months on a plant-based diet, my blood tests have improved substantially. Cholesterol is down 30 points, triglycerides down almost half, and my HDL/LDL levels have switched. The plant-based diet works! I'm continuing it and the doctor have reduced my medications accordingly. Watch the original ""Forks Over Knives"" and decide for yourself. I still stand by my review of the Extended Interviews given above.",1402617600,3,3461,4.885860306643952

The movie is exceedingly biased against animal products, and I feel that the movie forms a false connection between Eastern vs. Western diet and Animal vs. Plant diet.  They are simply not the same concepts.  One of the biggest problems with the so called ""western"" diet is the high proportion of processed food which is high in caloric density, carbohydrates, and salt and low in fiber and water.  Despite the insistance of the movie, the China study does not support the conclusion of this film and instead suggests that consumption of fish is inversely associated with the rate of cardiovascular disease.  Also, the effect size of diet on the population level is much smaller than expected.

For example, in okinawa, Japan, the area in the world with the longest average lifespan, a very small percentage of the populace is vegan.  They tend to eat a whole foods diet with small amounts of meat, mostly fish.

4554626,3,B0053ZHZI2,"This is a well made documentary and for the most part I enjoyed it (the open heart surgery part was not a particular joy to watch).

My disappointment with the film is this:  It was unbalanced, one-sided and really a mouthpiece for the 2 doctors involved.  There was lack of deeper discussion and alternative opinions apart from wheeling out some woman who was implied to be in the pocket of the meat industry.  It purported itself to be a balanced 2 sided argument but it was not.

It is a shame because a diet rich in vegetables is clearly a good thing.  That said, the film seemed to give the viewer permission to eat as much fruit as they would like.  That it is not generally regarded to be the case.  There was no discussion about other food groups such as nuts, fish etc - why not talk about that.  Also, little talk of organic vs. non organic vegetables and fruit.  Is a moderate amount of grass fed, responsibly reared meat and dairy really that dangerous to our health?

As I say, if you want credibility and to get my plaudits, you need to examine all sides of the arguments, giving each their fair shake.  Essentially telling the world to eat only fruit, vegetables and grains (the paleo crew would not agree with that last one) is not going to fly.

4554634,3,B0053ZHZI2,"I think it is a great documentary of the main studies that documented why animal protein is so carcinogenic and deadly. I do think it was a little bit basic for anyone who has done a lot of reading about nutrition, and it actually unfairly idolized the doctors in the movie because there were a lot more people who lived decades before these guys who did a ton of research on vegan nutrition (Arnold Ehret, like about a thousand more people really who could have added a lot more to the claims in this movie, haha). So I thought it was funny that the men in this video basically claim credit for ""discovering"" that vegan diets are a lot healthier than ones based on animal protein. The video in itself is actually hugely aimed at men and one character in the video is a professional fighter who is shown working out punching people and talking about his vegan lifestyle, the narrator himself seems like a ""good old"" fraternity type in his middle-aged years, and even a firefighter is shown insulting his coworker like a guys often do to their friends they pressure...and the same firefighter is shown climbing a firefighter pole repeating, ""Real men don't eat meat."" Women in the video are often shown being so happy their husbands are showing them the way to a better lifestyle... it is really a lot of sexist American crap that seems to paint an ignorant picture of women and definitely excludes them from identifying with the video.

I have never seen a nutrition documentary that is aimed so heavily at men and think the preview should have gone over that a bit more! I also take a few things in the video less seriously scientifically. I think the video should have really, really gone over why fresh vegan diets are immensely more healthy than ones based on cooked vegetables, canned foods, and worst of all cooked grains! I struggled with candida for years, and part of the problem was not believing how bad cooked food really is for you, especially if cooked food had been frozen which kills about everything worthwhile to a sick person that is in a vegetable or food source. Part of the life changing dietary change I took that might have saved a few of my teeth and maybe a few more important aspects of my body is that I began to buy into the idea that I should stick to just specific sources of carbohydrates like squash and sweet potatoes and avoid cooked beans, cooked grain, and processed bread. I also was helped immensely by eating raw cheese that was mostly goat cheese and also raw butter. I also was misled by the idea that you can eat as much fruit as you want, and the most important thing people don't realize though about fruit and especially fruit juice is that fructose is actually a lot worse for you than sucrose which is found in sugar... and on vegan diets you tend to eat a lot of fruit which definitely gives you candida, sugar level problems, and also makes your teeth have a lot more cavities than if you were just eating sugar (google Dr. Mercola's article on fructose please and the subject of fruitarians losing their teeth). I think there are other very important guidelines to a near vegan diet, such as being sure to discuss how oils can be beneficial when they are cold pressed (like olive oil and coconut oil) and how important it is to supplement with a very, very good vitamin D, calcium, and B12 pills that are not the cyano-derived kind. I really recommend reading Natalia Rose's most recent books and especially ""Detox for Women"" for what I think is the ""real"" healthiest diet. I also think Maria Emmerich's book, ""Secrets to a Healthy Metabolism"" complements Natalia Rose's book very well. I think it is sad that so many parts of American society are molded by stuck-up and arrogant men and think this movie is mainly aimed at affecting those people and ignores a lot of research that proves a vegan diet isn't really the best thing for most people but especially and most significantly if that person has a risk for getting a candida infection or gastritis, which unfortunately is turning out to be a risk for most people as the epidemic grows. I think given that candida is such a carcinogenic problem in itself, if you set yourself up to get it by draining minerals from your body by eating too much cooked food and grain in addition to disrupting your digestion by eating a lot of raw nuts which is what most vegetarian or vegan people do, you are probably going to get candida and eventually cancer on a poorly managed vegan diet...but if it does go by many guidelines that most people don't have time to research than I am sure it is healthy, although I think eating raw cheese and butter from goat sources is worth including in the diet. Please see Natalia Rose's books, and I don't think including a minimal amount of raw goat protein in a diet gives you cancer. I also think the movie should have discussed probiotics and the importance of taking whole food nutritional supplements if you do go vegan because artificial minerals and vitamins suck (I replaced my tooth enamel after eating too much grain by taking True Blue coral calcium). So, I think it is really ""dumb"" to just go cold-turkey vegan, and this is really not a wonderful base to start being a vegan and is really more like a documentary for the scientists in the movie who probably should have mentioned how badly United States doctors professionally treat cancer and blatantly ignore Candida compared to the 36 other countries who have a better healthcare rating than the USA according to the World Health Organization if they think stopping cancer is so important or makes them so important.",1400457600,3,5615,4.609390609390609

On the one hand, we have those in favor of the paleo/atkins/high protein and fat diet, and on the other we have the vegan revolution. Both sides largely scorn each other's ideas. Which do I eat? Which do I believe in? Who is telling the truth and who is lying?

There's a clear problem

There is clearly a problem in the realm of food consumption, and particularly in the United States, but the problem is quite different than some imagine it to be. Many are of the opinion that saturated fat is the culprit, and stopping the consumption of meat and dairy is what's needed. Others think carbs are to blame and encourage all to eat a carb-free diet. In reality...

Sat, Sugar, and Fat

Anyone who has read the book ""Salt, Sugar, and Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us"" probably has a decent idea of what the REAL problem is in the food we eat. While that book wasn't perfect, it did bring to light one trend that is absolutely destroying people's health, and that is... what many people are eating isn't actually food!

When you order a burger/taco/sandwich at most fast food restaurants, or buy something at the grocery store manufactured by one of the food giants, it's chemically altered, chemically flavored, chemically stripped of all possible nutrition cardboard enhanced for flavor with hydrogenated fats and chemically extracted corn sugar. THIS food is garbage in every conceivable way. And yes, it WILL give you diabetes, heart-attacks, and cancer.

Meat is not the root of all evil

I've really seen both sides argue quite forcefully, and as far as the pro-vegan side goes this documentary is probably the most persuasive/not threatening, but it's seen not complete until you see the other side. For my money, the best I've seen representing the much maligned meat/protein/fat side is the excellent ""Fat Head"". It shows how you can indeed eat meat/animal protein/fat and have your cholesterol go DOWN and your health get improve. Will it reduce your chance of heart attack/cancer/diabetes to eat a high fat/animal protein diet? I'd say that comes down to weather or not you overeat and if you are eating UNPROCESSED MEATS.

Veggies are still good for you

Eating fruit and veggies is good for you, no one can argue successfully that they aren't. Are they everything the body needs? That's up for debate. I know someone who is a vegan. While she feels very healthy, I'd say she could be on ""Superfat vs Superskinny"" and their experts would say she doesn't consume nearly enough fat, protein, and carbs, and is danger of sudden organ failure. This same person would say that my diet is probably going to kill me because I eat eggs and bacon for breakfast (and sometimes lunch or dinner). Since I've increased my intake of fruit and veggies, and simultaneous increased my consumption of protein and fat, I've lost weight, gained mental clarity and energy, and feel much, MUCH better than I did before. I still enjoy more processed foods than I should, but I consider myself to be balanced. Would I ever eat a completely vegan diet? Maybe I'd try it if I was DYING.

Balance is key

The scientists and nutritionists are still figuring this stuff out. They don't know for sure exactly what we should be eating, but a few things are clear. Processed, chemically engineered food (if you can call it that) is BAD, BAD, BAD! Meats and dairy? The jury is still out but clearly unprocessed  and as close as possible to found in nature is wildly better for you (grass-fed beef is arguably better for you than fish!). The same goes for whole milk that's not full of growth hormones etc. Dr Wallach famously read an article about people who lived over a hundred in an area, and not one of them was a vegetarian. He then read newspaper articles about vegetarians who died young (along with Doctors, atheletes, and health enthusiasts). Even on a vegan diet you can drop dead of nutritional deficiencies if you don't get minerals to replace those lost by agriculture and exercise.

The point of all this is just this. While this documentary is a decent entry point, don't take it as the end-all-be-all. Every person is different and needs to eat different kinds of food. There is no one-size-fits-all. There is room for variety. Except when it comes to processed food. Avoid that stuff like the plague.",1398643200,9,4398,4.7408376963350785

4554668,3,B0053ZHZI2,I started out with this  as someone who eats a Mediterranean diet including chicken and fish and very rarely lamb chops.  I tried to follow this diet because the DVD is very persuasive.  I found that living this way was not attractive to me in actual life.

4554669,5,B0053ZHZI2,"About 600,000 people die of heart disease in the US every year  thats one in four
deaths.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. Coronary heart disease and stroke either directly or indirectly costs the US 300 billion each year.  And the cost increases each year. ( Center for Disease Control data)(Johns Hopkins Health Library)

The probability of developing invasive cancers in the US from 2007-2009 for men from birth to death was 44.81% or close to 1 in 2 men.  For women from birth to death the rate was 38.17%  or (1 in 3).  (American Cancer Society info, dated  2013)

On diabetes, the key facts are that nearly 10% of the entire U.S. population has diabetes, including over 25% of seniors.  If present trends continue, 1 in 3 American adults will have diabetes in 2050.  Updated to March, 2013,  the cost of diabetes in the U.S. in 2012 came to $245 billion.  (American Diabetes Association)

In 1994, no state had more than 20% of its population obese.  In 2010, no state had less than 20% of its population obese.  Those are sad statistics.  68% of adults in the US are overweight or obese. Widespread obesity is a recent phenomenon.  It was ushered in by the TV dinner followed by a deluge of processed ready-to- eat meals.  The viewer finds out with ample evidence that whole foods instead of processed foods can cure diabetes and obesity.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on health care per capita ($8,608), and more on health care as a percentage of its GDP (17.2%), than any other nation in 2011.  Our Health and Human Services Department expects that the health share of GDP will continue its historical upward trend, reaching 19.5% of GDP by 2017.  But the Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries, while noting  U.S. care costs the most.  In a 2013 Bloomberg ranking of nations with the most efficient health care systems, the United States ranks 46th among the 48 countries included in the study.  A 2001 study in five states found that medical debts contributed to 46.2% of all personal bankruptcies and in 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses.  A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses.  So we have ever higher medical costs with little progress in curing these chronic diseases. (Wikipedia)

On these health issues, we certainly could use help and relief.  But can nutrition provide this relief in the form of alternative medicine?  The two men you will meet in this film Forks over Knives assert that nutrition can do what the AMA and Big Pharma have failed to do in the last century.  And they provide startling and convincing evidence that it can be done and that they have done it.  Buy or rent this DVD.  It can save your life.

Most of the doctors that I have seen in the past was all about putting me on more drugs (pills or insulin).  With eating my vegetables, fruits, and allowable proteins, I know I can do this.  I haven't been much of a meat eater in the past few months; so I feel that having the more healthy food will be a lot better for me.

The eminent film critic, and dean of U.S. film critics, Roger Ebert, rightly said of FORKS OVER KNIVES: ""This DVD can SAVE YOUR LIFE!""

This DVD is about u.s. dietary reform, particularly personal, but also at the U.S. government level - local, state, and federal.

This DVD is especially gratifying for its severe indictment of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.) by recognizing that the U.S.D.A. has an extreme, and damnable, conflict of interest with the best health interests U.S. public, in the form of - inter alia - the U.S.D.A.'s recommended guidelines for what the U.S. public should be eating, recommendations which are in fundamental conflict of interests with promoting the positive health of the U.S. public.

This DVD is also gratifying for its exposure of how self-dealing U.S. corporations, and U.S. corporate money, dominate the self-dealing, advisory or other decision-making bodies at the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the highest ""scientific"" body in the U.S. government.  This is not ""science,"" it is self-dealing advocacy by picked agents of self-dealing U.S. corporations.

The revolutionary disclosures and exposures of this DVD should, among other things, outrage the U.S. public as to the U.S. government's abuse of its duty to protect and enhance the health of the U.S. public.

Take note, U.S. citizens, for each one of us need to be our own nutritional guardian - the locus of dietary control needs to be in each individual.

I have posted my ""customer review"" of the DVD entitled FORKS OVER KNIVES: THE EXTENDED INTERVIEWS, which is a complementary companion to the DVD reviewed here, and is just as important.

From the 70 year old running marathons in Hawaii, apparently it can do a lot.

Basically this documentary goes over the pro's of vegetables and the cons of animal meat, to the nitty gritty of why, it never says you
should stop eating meat, but the information that's shown, is quiet impactfull enough to where you will definitely cut down on
meat consumption if nothing else. ..

I watched this at the suggestion of an acquaintance, and have no regrets from watching. It was very interesting and worth the small price tag to watch. I learned a lot.

But to really get the most out of it, I believe a complimentary book was released along side the movie, to fill in some gaps, or provide recipes etc.. I have yet to purchase that. Obviously with more information the better informed you will be about whether this is something you should tackle.

I plan on implementing what I watched, slowly into my diet, where it seems logical to do so.

She recommended that I seriously consider reading a book called The China Study. I bought a copy and took the next month to read it. Glad I did! That lead to doing some research on the I-Net related to Diabetes where I came across this movie. I am so glad I bought it and now recommend it to friends, family and anyone willing to hear what I have to say about it.

4554783,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Based in part on the results of a ground-breaking observational and epidemiological study on nutrition and degenerative disease in China, in the late 90s. by 2 leading scientists, one American and one Chinese, this film pulls no punches and does not pussy-foot around the links between obesity, diabetes, many cancers, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis and other degenerative conditions, and the typical Western industrialised McDiet. That is, a diet high in artificial processed foods, heavily laced with saturated and hydrogenated fats, corn syrup and other sweeteners, salt, meat and dairy produce from factory farmed methods, heavy on the additional growth hormones, antibiotics and fed on pesticide rich vegetation as the least offensive option. Several recent food scandals showed factory farming has also resulted in herbivores being fed ground up animal remains in order to boost weight, with predictable results.

This is a documentary and educational film which takes that study, and others, hooking up Colin Campbell, one of the aforementioned scientists, and author of the mainstream book brought out from those findings, The China Study, with work done with seriously ill patients, treated by radical changes in diet, rather than pharmaceuticals.

Colin Campbell, co-author of The China Study and clinician Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn go further than linking our additive rich, tampered with, factory farmed chunks of flesh rich diet as the prime cause of the rise in degenerative disease. Their evidence heavy material convinces that whether heavy meat and dairy consumption is processed or of more natural, traditional provenance, it is the high protein concentration itself which is the problem. There are some sobering cross-over lab studies cited around high levels of protein switching on and low levels of protein switching off tumour development. Sure, these are lab rat studies, and we do always have to question the validity of studies applied to one animal being extrapolated over to another species, but, sobering and thought provoking.

This is of course not new material - there have been many, smaller studies, reaching the same conclusion. What is interesting about The China Study - and this film based largely around those findings, is that both Campbell and Esselstyn, nutritional scientist and clinician, respectively, are not vegans on ethical grounds, or banging a drum for their dietary beliefs through vested financial interests. Rather, both of them, originally from farming (cattle rearing) stock, CHANGED their views because of the evidence they found - Campbell from a life-time in nutritional research, initially espousing the we need more protein line, and Esselstyn working at the start with seriously ill heart attack patients who were so far down the line there was little that could be done for them except a dreadful cocktail of surgery or drugs which were not expected to extend life beyond months. Years later, survivors both from his initial cohort, and later patients, tell their own surprised and miraculous (to them) stories of the rapid and positive changes in health caused by moving to a plant based wholefood diet.

As this short, direct, fierce and sensible film wears on, other reasons for vegetarianism are woven in, beyond the compelling evidence for personal health. These include some references to the ethical arguments, the arguments around the waste of resources in terms of land as the clearing of rainforests to provide arable land so that the developed world can continue to eat itself to unwellness continues apace. They lay out information about starvation in some parts of the world happening precisely because resources are going to feed the animals that will feed the haves, rather than the land being used for plant material to feed the have-nots of mankind directly. There are also the economic arguments about the unsustainable costs of healthcare in the developed world, as more and more expensive pharmaceutical drugs are seen as the cure for, or control of, degenerative and debilitating conditions which have been caused by our poisonous diet.

Not to mention tie ups between the interests of big pharma, big agri, and politics.

The film makes the telling case that logic, ethics, evidence, environmental concerns all point to a simpler answer. In the words of that other politics of food prophet, Michael Pollan

Eat Food. Eat Less of It. Eat More Plants

This is not a film presented by sweet hangovers from the love and peace brown rice, flowers in the ringlets and lentils era - this is hard edged, well argued, with plenty of evidence from all sorts of surprising people, including a group of fire-fighters, medal winning runners and a rather well-muscled martial arts experts, that wholefood plants based diets are for seriously fit people.

I watched this a couple of years ago with my husband, but he likes to baby step things, so we worked slowly at getting switched, from animal to plant based and we have been truly happy with results! Even when we were baby stepping the switch, he lost over 80 lbs and claims he's never felt better! I've experienced stabilizing of my body like I've never known. I used to think being sick, (nauseous, sweats, throwing up, hot fleshes, dizziness to the point of staying conscious was a challenge, and unable to keep any type of food down) was normal. I started on my road to health when I gave up on doctors and took matters into my own hands. This was before I had seen this show. I had to come off meats then, and only ate fruits and veggies, but I found that conventional foods only helped a little, when I went to organic I was cured!  Since then I had gone back to some meats and dairy products, but after watching my husband do so well and feel so happy, I knew I was ready to go off all of it again, but this time permanently! I personally still stick to organic, but when adding that quality to this life style, I've never felt better!

Whether all the information that the movie presents is valid was not my concern. However, I felt convinced that the message was clear enough for me to  make a change. My weight was far too heavy in my opinion and my health was in decline. After less than a week on this plant based diet I am already amazed at the progress. My weight has reduced and as further encouragement beyond the scale reading I have received comments from family and friends that they see a weight reduction. I am  starting to recover some long lost energy and a welcome reduction in malaise. I am a believer, a convert.

Luckily there wasn't very much of it.

Well I had tried everything else including excercise and no changes.  So after one week of vegetarian diet i noticed a 20 point drop, two weeks later another 20 point drop, and by the end of the month i was at 127/81.  This got me thinking what happened?  I told a friend of my what had happened and he told me it sound like this movie so i decided to watch it.  After watching it what I had done started to make sense, my diet was killing me. I was basically consuming too much salt and a switch to vegetarian basically eliminate sodium, since I stopped eating processed food.  I also lowered my cholesterol and weight which was a plus.  The movie is a nice movie and they make some key points that they observed.  I don't agree with the movie 100% bc im not sure about being cured of diabetees with this methob is accurate.  I don't have diabetes, and while the diet works well for diabetics I question the cure part.  But I will say I do agree with it 95%, for high blood pressure this worked great.

It's great to see this information reaching the general public.  This is something the general medical profession should be presenting as an option (it may not appeal to everyone, but everyone should be informed that it does work).

Anyone who found this video interesting should also watch ""The Extended Interviews"".

For anyone who thinks vegans are wimpy:  My wife is 66 years old, weighs 116 pounds, does 8 chin-ups, 50 sit-ups, 50 push-ups (all to Marine standards for 18-20 year olds), runs 10 K races, and gets evil looks from high school girls when their boy friends stare.",1387411200,,768,4.922480620155039
4554910,4,B0053ZHZI2,"This diet actually WORKS in REDUCING bad cholesterol level. A friend of mine got his bad cholesterol level dropped from high to low after 6 months of a healthy diet without taking any medication. During that time, the amount of meat and dairy products he consumed daily is less than 20 percent of the total amount of food he ate. It's reasonable and believable because non-animal based food does not contain any cholesterol. He's still on it today and still healthy without having to take any medication.

The claim that plant-based food can control or reverse cancer is not scientifically proven. It can be proved right with some cases of some patients like the movie did. In other cases, it is wrong. For example, Linda McCartney, former wife of Paul McCartney, died of breast cancer even though she was a vegetarian long before it was detected.

Another problem is it is very difficult to follow a complete-plant-based diet for the rest of our lives. Just look around and you will see what I mean. A lot of vegetarian people eat a little bit of eggs, cheese and milk. But with this diet, you are not allowed to eat any amount of those types of food. How many people can do that? For the people who can, I congratulate you on your health. I am happy for you. In fact, there is no method that works for everybody.

In short, this movie deserves 4 stars by proving a complete plant-based diet can eliminate the risk of high cholesterol. It also inspires people to keep themselves healthy without taking medication.
I am following my friend's example. It is easier to achieve and sustain.

First I cut way, way, way back on sugar (not completely ought though.) I lost about 10 lbs in about 3 weeks. Then I bought a ""Hamilton Beach"" Big Mouth Pro Juicing Machine. I lost 20 lbs the first week doing the detox method (juicing fresh, almost all organic veggies and a little fruit.) I was not hungry, though I still had some cravings for sweets, steak, etc. It is important to know that I never let myself get hungry. I drank the 16 oz juice 3 times a day for 21 days snacking on cut up fresh veggies when I felt the need. My weight loss stalled a little, then slowly started moving again. It has been 6 weeks now and I currently have lost 40 lbs., went from a 38"" waist to a 34."" My shoes are now laced as tight as they will go and are now slip-ons. I feel & look healthier. I have a better attitude now and my doctor took me off most of my meds. He said over time, I may get off them all.

Honestly, you do have to have drive, enthusiasm, and determination. However, you do NOT have to be hungry and want to make sure you are not hungry. Otherwise you trigger a starvation involuntary bodily response to store fat due to the bodily perception of food shortage. This is only one reason why ordinary DIETS DO NOT WORK!

Of course, there is a whole lot more science, medical research and trials out there related to the benefits of a plant based diet, so for all the nay-sayers: point us to a similar accumulation of research/papers/studies done by objective third parties (not tied to industry, either pharmaceutical or meat/dairy related) that states that we all absolutely need meat to cure the cancers/heart disease/diabetes that is killing the consumers of the western diet.

4554984,3,B0053ZHZI2,"Although I certainly understand the enthusiasm that many reviewers have for the central thesis of this film, and I certainly believe that there is little good in a diet heavily focused on meat (particularly red meat), I want to caution people to think twice before buying into the notion that all you have to do is eat a whole foods vegan diet and your chance of getting cancer and other diseases will disappear. I  know someone who has eaten such a diet all of his adult life and still got prostate cancer.  He told me that the disease has run rampant through generations of men in his family and it was just a matter of time before it hit him.  That scenario is also true of me.  My father died of prostate cancer and so did his father.  It turns out mine was caught in time, but it seems those nasty cancer cells are trying to make a return engagement while all other aspects of my heath, including my weight, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. are in excellent shape!

I have another example of an alternative scenario.  I work for an organization that has pretty powerful board members.  One of those directors takes annual trips to Sweden with her husband.  Both are vegans and have been most of their adult lives (and they are both now in their early 70's).  While on one of their trips to Sweden, they got into a terrible car accident.  Their survival was very questionable.  But they both emerged from comas and were eventually in good enough condition to eat solid food.  When the Swedish doctors learned they were vegan, the couple was given a choice: eat the vegan diet and increase your chances of not surviving, or start eating meat and live because of the various animal derived protein benefits of building the body back up to good health.  I regret that I cannot be more specific about what those benefits were because the accident happened roughly 12 years ago and I simply can't remember.  In any event, the couple started eating meat and continued to do so for a number of years.  Some three or so years ago they returned to the vegan diet and appear to be doing well.

What am I trying to say through all of this?  Well, the first thing is I don't believe in miracles.  If all it takes to eliminate cancer in the world is a vegan diet then you can bet a huge percentage of the world's population would have embraced it.  But such a claim hasn't been proven and I think it's cruel to give hope to someone suffering from cancer, or likely to get it because of genetic family history, by saying all they need to do is eat plant-based whole food.  This may, in fact, be true of some people, but it certainly won't be true for all.  NOTHING is a magic bullet.

One last story: I know of a very tragic case of a German woman who had three daughters.  She watched two of her daughters die of breast cancer, both under forty-years-old and both in otherwise good heath, neither was the least overweight, both ate great diets, were extremely successful, and were married with families.  The third daughter pre-emptively had her breasts removed in order to avoid getting the disease.  I think she's still okay.  But in the meantime, her mother died of breast cancer as did her mother's sister.  It virtually decimated the women in her family.  I really whether all of them would have lived had they eaten a whole foods vegan diet.  If I recall correctly, at least one of the deceased was a vegetarian, but I don't know if she was vegan.

Please embrace this diet if you feel so inclined. It will more than likely do wonders for those suffering from obesity (as long as the focus on carbs is controlled), those with diabetes and a host of other conditions.  Hell, I may embrace it myself!  But be realistic as well.  There aren't too many miracles out there even though early morning Saturday infomercials want you to believe otherwise.",1382918400,3,3850,4.507936507936508

This documentary is one of our favorite to share with family and friends because it helps people get back to a sensible, as well as delicious, diet they can enjoy and stay with.

After seeing this documentary, you feel like you have much more control over your weight and overall nutrition.  Lastly, you really discover that this type of diet is not boring to eat!

4554996,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Very inspiring documentary about eating a plant-based diet to control and prevent disease. Worth watching and taking into consideration, if not immediate action. It's not a scare-tactic film which is refreshing -- the filmmakers don't want to terrorize with the information they're presenting (we get enough of that in modern culture). Rather, the intent is to be informative and inspiring:
we can take charge of our health using nutrition to maintain good health. However, the next step is to assist people in how to plan meals, shop and cook -- their information is good but without that next step, is not so easy to put into practice for most people.",1382140800,,653,4.945454545454545

It reinforced my desire to practice a vegetarian diet and really raised my awareness of the health risks associated with consuming dairy products.  My mother broke both hips at the age of 73.  I definitely do not want to follow in her footsteps and have completely eliminated dairy products as a result of viewing this film.  Although the film contained a lot of statistical data, it also incorporated the experiences of real people.

4555007,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I first came across this documentary, about two years or more ago. I first became aware of it on HBO's real time with Bill Mar's
talk show and the individual who created the movie was the guest on his show and he shared the cold truth about the food industry,
and it's direct link to pre mature deaths, so many health disorders, how to combat these ills by simply changing your diet to a plant
base diet and the information was so comprehensive, and well written I was truly impressed. So I gave this information out to
close to 20 or more people over a period of one or more years after the discovery of this film.
It has also changed how I thought about food and the food choices I have made in the past and the types of foods that I have chosen to eat. Since then, I have been an advocate for better living through healthy eating. Which has caused my health to drastically improve. I have not experienced a sick day for quite a long time now since I have changed the way I eat. By the grace of God, I will be extending my life expectancy for another 50 or more years I am now 56 years old and I look much younger than my actual age and my energy levels are very good. I have not contracted a cold, flu or any other health disorders since I have made better choices of foods to consume, my diet has changed.
In closing, I feel that everyone should buy and watch this movie and make a conscious decision to change their eating habits and contact the people who produced this film at [...] This web page has a lot of helpful articles, videos and seminars to review and sound advice based on the facts and research, not speculation, theory or conjecture but sound evidence to prove their findings from experts who dedicated their lives to help millions to live better and stay healthy. The information provided
if applied, will change your health and reduce your medical bills drastically. Did you know that the medical, food and dairy industries are bed fellows and regularly get together to devise ways of keeping the American and western world sick and dependent on using costly drugs which have costly and painful side effects, which will make you sick and kill you eventually?
Let the experts that are in this film along with their experience, their wisdom (In this Forks over Knives video) and their knowledge be your guide.

In Korea, the masses of people eat vegetables and soups and maintain their health in a very noticeable way.

being raised using fast growing hormones, given antibiotics etc. but I had no idea what extent the commercial
Cattle farmers had gone to bulk up and get more cash for their products. It makes you want to become a vegetarian.
This DVD is very factual. Data from two MD's during their 30 years of collecting nutritional data is very convincing!

4555064,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I was eating candy and crackers while I watched the beginning of this movie. Seriously....wondering why I felt sluggish and needed to lose weight. Already a vegetarian, I thought I was healthy enough. Wrong. This movie completely opened my eyes to food. The science behind the plant-based diet is staggering. The brilliant doctors showcased came from childhoods growing up on dairy and meat farms. I feel better and have lost weight without trying. My old constant hunger has vanished. I feel every person should watch this movie.",1378339200,,530,5.103448275862069
4555065,5,B0053ZHZI2,I think that Forks Over Knives speaks volumes.  We as a nation need to take control of our food choices.  What we eat makes such a big difference in our quality of life.  My 15 year old daughter was really inspired to go Plant Strong after watching Fork Over Knives.,1378339200,,266,4.28
4555066,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Americans are naive about their health care system.  The system is not here to make people healthy. On the contrary, it is designed to treat sick people because that is where the money is.  Hospitals, for example, make huge sums doing open heart surgery, heart transplants and other surgical procedures. Yet heart disease is preventable and reversible.  No one should die of cardiovascular disease in America.  No one should ever reach the point where they need a stent or other surgical procedure.  But our doctors are neither trained nor motivated to work with a patient to stop and reverse the disease.  There is no money to be made doing this.  The few doctors who do are like attorneys who represent the indigent.  They are motivated by ethics; they want to do the right thing; they may not become rich.  So, if you want to be among the healthy and avoid degenerative disease, see this profound film.  I was so impressed I purchased 11 copies and am giving the film to friends and family.",1378339200,,993,4.687861271676301

4555071,5,B0053ZHZI2,The two doctors profiled on this video have done those of us who want to stay healthy without having to take piles of pills a real service making this film.  Even if you don't want to move to a completely plant based diet as they advocate the insights they provide to how the human body deals with the things we put in it in the form of food are invaluable.  Interesting to learn too that the Cornell researcher has been marginalized by the food industry and no longer gets the funding for his research he once did.  Any wonder there are so many obese Americans when our beloved food industry attempts to quiet those telling us how bad what they've developed is for us.

4555074,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I have been a vegan for a long time, a vegetarian for far longer, over 20 years. I can personally attest to the benefits of a plant-based diet. I am 60, yet my blood work numbers are all in the perfect range; I have no need for any prescription drugs; and I have ten times more energy than other people my age. My only regret is not becoming a vegan earlier. However, I did not become a vegan for my health -- I did for the animals.

Forks Over Knives presents compelling evidence of what the meat industry is doing to our nation's health. Both the doctors' research is well researched and well presented. They attack the common misconceptions that we are brought up with: that we need meat for the protein and that we need milk for the calcium. For anyone who has any concern for their health and the health of this planet, this is a must-see film.",1377907200,,849,4.30625

Honestly, probably not going to give up carne asada, but will reduce my ""meat based protein"" intake. Very informative regardless of your position on meat vs vegetables. The correlation (and implied causation) between meat based diet & cancer was jaw dropping. Not sure it's worth $15, but it's worth watching.

Edit: my review was of the DVD, not the ""instant video"". Hence my reference to $15.",1377820800,,474,5.076923076923077
4555078,4,B0053ZHZI2,This is a very thought provoking movie. I try to eat healthfully but had no idea that meat and dairy were so full of hormones and things that cause disease. All the statistics and documentation were very convincing that we should all at the very least cut down on the amount of meat and dairy that we consume.,1377734400,,309,4.344827586206897

I eat way too many meat and cheese substitutes and not enough fresh, whole foods. After watching this, I'm convinced that my diet, though vegan, is still a long way from being really healthy, because most of my food comes processed and in a package.

I'm dedicating myself to this new life style (I don't see it as a diet at all. I'm not choosing this way of life because of weight, though I am loosing weight, but because I have chronic illnesses.)

  FORKS OVER KNIVES
  by brett reeves 12.19.12
I sent you this DVD to watch cause I am truly concerned,
For all the that IS truth about eating and nutrition is NOT what we learned.

This journey of mine has revealed some shocking things about the powers that be and are.
Don't take my word for it, check it out yourself. The lies and deceit in this country start at the top and go deep and far.

Diet, drugs and chronic disease-the truth about which should be dealt with as serious, not funny.
Investigate for yourself and you'll discover that the truth is OK as long as it doesn't effect industry money.

This is important quality of life type stuff that demands your attention soon.
Worse than any conspiracy theory about JFK or if we ever really went to the moon.

Sitting down and watching this well done flick does not require you to be a sleuth.
90 minutes is all it takes, and on the subject of diet and chronic disease you will finally know the truth.",1373932800,,1254,4.513274336283186

They guys were all of the same mind set, but were acting independently towards figuring out a new way to save patients' lives! I love this book!

As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of all things dairy (okay, not all, but butter, cheese, yogurt, and milk are on the list), I wasn't quite ready to go vegan (was already vegetarian) -- but the health implications of eating dairy made me reconsider how much I really knew about eating dairy. I reduced my milk and egg consumption.

I have since gone vegan (not directly because of this movie) and have bought a copy of it for my mom (my love of dairy comes from her). Worried about her eating habits, I wanted her to watch this and pass it on. I don't think you can get the message in one viewing, but if you watch it a d return back to it a few months later, you may get something out of it.

This documentary revenues The China Study a lot, so if you're more of a reader or prefer to read the major study cited directly, check that out as a starting point. (Not just o e study is cited...that would be pretty lame.)

If you're curious about the health benefits of reducing dairy consumption, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Not too preachy...just great information (and not too scientific).

I then took the video to the second person who has had 3 heart attacks and took her Caldwell Esselstyn's book titled: PREVENT AND REVERSE HEART DISEASE. This young lady is very similar to the patents that joined Dr. Essy on his diet and after a few years they reversed the heart disease within their bodies and are living today after 20 years.

The video highlights the problems that doctors have when they try to under a disease and when they find and understand that the thing that is killing us is our food: 1.) the doctors peers see the doctors taking away their ability to make a living; 2.) and the owners of the giant food industry controls the minds of the food lobbyists and the industries scientists that speak what the food giants want said; even when they know that it meat and dairy that is killing our children, our adults and our nation.

Almost everything that our doctors treat from heart, bones, to cancer to diseases of the brain are caused by this nation's love with meat and dairy.

We've found that the South Beach Diet is more balanced and works well for us.  When we are on it, we have no health complaints and we lose weight.  South Beach allows dairy (not milk), very lean meat (in small portions), fruits, vegetables and all whole grains (whole wheat flour, brown rice, nuts, etc.).

4555245,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Very well done documentary that changed the way I understood nutrition and what constitutes a healthy diet. I rented it a year ago after my marathon-running father had a heart attack after being told his cholesterol was good (180) and he was in great shape for his age (77).  He was on no medication prior to this, but after the heart attack was put on 4-- statin, blood pressure, something to keep the stent inside his coronary artery open, and one other.  These medications caused him to slow down, have memory problems, and zapped his energy.

Determined to figure this out, I began with this documentary, read The China Study and the works of others including Esselstyne's 'Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease' (great).  A year later, my father, older brother and I are all on the plant based diet and feel better than great. My cholesterol went from 190 to 136, my blood pressure is down to 107/68 (from 138/88). My athletic endurance is amazing.  My father has also seen his cholesterol and blood pressure numbers drop; he  is off his statin and blood pressure medications.

Transitioning to this type of eating is easy when you see a family member suffer an unexpected heart attack and have to be scented.  My father thought he was eating correctly with so-called lean meats, no fried foods, no fast foods, plenty of vegetables, and fruit.  After you watch this documentary, which presents the science in a logical way, you cannot rationally go back to the SAD diet (standard American diet) which promotes cardiovascular disease and a host of other diseases.  Understanding the affects of animal proteins and fats is crucial if you want to have abundant health.  Genetics load the gun, but diet pulls the trigger.

4555256,2,B0053ZHZI2,"While watching this, it kept my interest by catching the flawed ""science"" as it jumps from one testimonial to another of people who have switched to a ""plant based diet"". The main message is that consuming any animal protein at all from either meat dairy or eggs will make you fat and give you heart disease and switching to a plant based diet will not only stop but reverse diabetes, heart disease and cancer. While there is scientific consensus that lowering your overall fats and eating a variety of plants can improve your health, this Op-ed goes on to make wild claims of curing cancer and diabetes through no more than eating a vegan only diet and eliminating virtually all protein from your diet.
Needless to say after hearing wild claims with flaky, at best, science to support it. I felt like it was more pushing a vegan agenda and at the end of the op-ed was even more skeptical about the idea of a plant based diet than before watching it",1369785600,3,949,4.523255813953488

Especially when you factor in the damage to top soil feeding cows when you could be growing edible plants. So I was already familiar with some of the concepts covered. The movie doesn't talk much about the environmental impact but it was interesting to learn about reversing damage in your body from eating animal products. While I don't think it's a cure all for everything, it has definitely motivated us to start making an effort to reduce animal product consumption.

How could whole foods plant-based eating be so good for the body?  And how could we have been so misguided?  The film suggests answers to these important questions.

I've heard for years that the healthiest diet on Earth is a plant-based Diet.  I wasn't ready to commit to it, though based on the fact that I simply didn't know the facts behind it.  I didn't know the science behind it.  If it's so healthy than why do most of our doctors recommend eating lean meat, for protein and low-fat dairy for calcium?  Why is it that most of our weight-loss and health books recommend eating high amounts of meat and dairy to build muscle, boost metabolism, and shed fat?  I was a firm believer in ""The South Beach Diet"" and had great results with it.

After Reading ""The China Study"" I started leaning into a plant-based diet.  I noticed the biggest change in my skin.  My skin cleared up, the bags under my eyes started to disappear, and my skin was taking on more of a glow.  I still ate meat, but had reduced it down to one meal a week.  I did this for about a month.  I am not over-weight by any means, but I was hoping to lose some weight.  I didn't.  I have now figured out that it was because I was eating high amounts of nut and nut butter.  When I figured out my calorie intake it was way more than my body needed.  I know this now.  Frustrated by this at the time, I turned away from the plant-based diet and went back to ""South Beach.""  I need to get my body in bikini shape and build some muscle.  I can't do that by eating plants? The China Study convinced me of the health benefits of a plant-based diet, but not the body-building aspect.

Once I added more animal protein into my diet, almost instantly, my skin broke out.  My constipation came back. I was starting to get bags under my eyes again I hadn't even noticed had disappeared. Yes, I was losing weight (I was counting my calories religiously and was consuming between 1200-1400 calories per day), but I didn't feel as good.  My skin was losing it's ""Glow.""  It wasn't until I picked up a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beauty-Detox-Foods-Discover-the-Top-50-Beauty-Foods-That-Will-Transform-Your-Body-and-Reveal-a-More-Beautiful-You/dp/0373892640/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beauty Detox Foods: Discover the Top 50 Beauty Foods That Will Transform Your Body and Reveal a More Beautiful You</a>&nbsp;that I discovered the reasons behind why my skin was looking so healthy when I was following a plant-based diet.  When I reflected on what I was eating it became clear to me, I gained weight eating plant-based foods because I was choosing to eat high-caloric plant-based foods in high amounts.  It wasn't the plants making me gain weight, it was the calories.  Sure the calories are from healthier sources, but it all comes down to one basic principle, if you consume more calories than your body needs you will gain weight.  I needed a refresher course on what I learned in the China Study.

Which brings me to this DVD.  It basically summarized everything I had read in the China Study, but I had forgotten.  For me, watching a movie has greater lasting power on my memory than reading a book.  It was so nice to hear T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Esselstyn.  Watching the study results, hearing the people mentioned in the book speak, and seeing the actual test results patients had a different impact on me.  I now know that a whole-food plant-based diet done properly is extremely beneficial to ones health.  The secret is a Low-fat whole-food plant-based diet.  Science has proven it and I am now convinced. I highly recommend this DVD as well as the aforementioned books.  It will change the way you approach food if you just give it a try.  I have been back on the plan for a week and my skin is clearing up, beginning to glow, and slowly I am losing weight.  My energy is improving too.  I have not completely eliminated the meat, but I have eliminated Dairy.  I am leaning into it, but making progress every day.",1368316800,4,4367,5.1303116147308785

After watching Forks Over Knives, the movie Vegucated and reading Age Less, Live More by Bernando Lapallo (which wrote and published just a few years ago, the author is a radiant 111 years old man) I was floored by the power of a vegan diet.  We are being neglected, some would say deceived by the US Department of Agriculture, the food industry and many scientists.

After seeing the overwhelming evidence and correlating consumption of animal products with disease I had to make a change. I've been a vegan for 3 months and love it. I'm a healthy, active 39 year-old and to my surprise I don't miss meat or dairy one bit..  Watching this movie has had an amazingly positive impact on my life.

4555354,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Forks over Knives reveals the truth about heart disease and the relationship to meat and dairy products. Forks over Knives follows several patients with heart disease while providing information from cardiologist Dr. Essylstyn MD from the Cleveland Clinic and explains some of the findings from the book The China Study.

I have learned the truth, but only after my mother died of heart disease and my father died of multiple organ failure stemming from liver failure which I am certain statin drugs played a key role.  The final straw was when my husband was battling Severe Congestive Heart Failure when a medical doctor accidentally induced his experience with death, a very traumatic experience; thankfully he was resuscitated.  Together we began a journey to find the truth about heart disease - we had no other choice - doctors gave him mere days to live and turned their backs to helping him get healthier after providing the only temporary options as being devices, procedures and medications.  My husband made that ultimate choice, that he would rather be dead than to have his quality of life consisting of machinery and drugs. We succeeded - 5 full years later and he's not only alive and well, but has overcome all these issues. If he can do it, most anyone is able.

Begin by watching Forks Over Knives.  When you are convinced and are ready to begin your journey it will be tough. Cravings will manifest. Old habits will return. I recommend watching Forks Over Knives periodically, coupled with the movies Eating, Food Inc., King Corn, etc.

If Heart Disease is a concern, or Diabetes, or Obesity, or any combination of these chronic issues, may I recommend the following:

As a result, I've lost 12 pounds without even trying, I walk the stairs to my office on the third floor numerous times every day, my mood has improved dramatically (things at work that would normally frustrate me don't anymore), I'm actually waking up BEFORE my alarm feeling refreshed and ready for the day instead of hitting the snooze button 4 times and forcing myself to finally get up.  I now get up an hour earlier than before eating all plant-based and have the energy and and drive to workout regularly again.  I can't wait for my annual checkup in August to see where my cholesterol and weight is.  I also watched Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead and have added juicing to my everyday diet a month ago also -- I didn't think it was possible to feel even better, but adding juicing to my vegan diet is now a daily part of my life.  I can't begin to describe how good I feel!  Amazing!!",1366761600,,1380,4.325581395348837
4555358,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I am considering the Vegan Life Style, and this Forks Over Knives DVD certainly got my attention!  Everyone should at least watch it!",1366761600,,133,4.782608695652174
4555359,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Why does our government, the USDA and other so-called repsected institutions cover up or hide the truth from the otherwise intelligent U.S. population.  Eating animals is not good for us.  We don't have to be slaves to past traditions or paradigms that blind us.  Vote with your fork!",1366761600,,284,4.875
4555360,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I've always been fascinated with anything concerning human nutrition. In college, I took several nutrition classes and almost made a career out of dietetics, just because I was so deeply attracted to the power of healthy foods. But those nutrition classes never came close to something as life changing as this documentary. Call it radical, because it is in today's typical American diet. But it's what I have been searching for.

I want real answers, not a ridculous Food Pyramid that almost every doctor in America will recommend you follow on a daily basis along with bottles of pills. I want real food, not high fructose corn syrup, artifical flavors, brominated vegetable oil, aspartame...the list goes on and on. Why is that crap in our food? Are you really sure you want to trust the government to tell you what's safe to eat now-a-days? I want a healthy body, to run marathons, compete in triathalons, anything I set my mind to. I want to be educated on how certain foods affect my body to know how to better serve my muscles, my bones, my organs. I want to reverse heart disease, cancer, diabetes.

For years I have looked at my extended family, seen them suffer from diabetes, strokes, high blood pressure, heart attacks and cancer. And silently I have listened to my mind tell me, ""It's coming for you too. Those things are genetic; they run in families. Even though you try to eat healthy, damage is already done. Too late for you.""

According to Forks and Knives, it's never too late. And it's not genetic. It all has to do with your DIET.

You may have eaten fast food for decades, are overweight, and are a walking heart attack. But there's still hope. Because the human body is a working miracle. You feed it what it needs, and it will clear out cholesterol from your arteries. It will stabalize your insulin. The weight can be dropped with no pills or surgery.

It's simple. Eat a whole food plant based diet.

I never pictured myself as a vegan. There have been times when I have been close to becoming a vegetarian, but vegan? Gosh, how would I live (now I see how ignorant that little question is)? But all the carefully conducted research presented in Forks and Knives is hard to ignore. Eating an animal based diet greatly contributes to cancer, diabetes, heart disease. Dairy and meat, which are both so prolific in our American diet, is what have caused such an uncontrollable epedemic in our nation. You look at our children today, wonder why 1 in 3 of them are overweight or obese? This may be the first generation whose lifespan is less than that of it's parents. If that doesn't shake you up, I don't know what will.

Watch it. I guarentee it will change you. My meat and dairy loving husband, who I thought would never be able to give up such things, watched this with me and it has completely transformed him.

Then give a whole food plant diet a go. Just try it for 2 weeks. The results you see will most likely astonish you. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your family.",1366761600,,3017,4.553505535055351

Full disclosure: I've much admiration of Amazon's search functions and wonderfully intuitive way it works. Search and ye shall find. At first blush, Amazon ""FORKS OVER KNIVES"" search yields 897 HITS! Filtering of results produce much food for thought.
Amazon's publishing of 995 reviews greatly furthers SERIOUS intellectual inquiry.

Beyond posting another ""preaching to the choir"" 5 star rating, I urge those of you who are not already doing so, in initial product evaluation, to START with Amazon reviews and then use Google and You Tube. ""Forks Over Knives"" has 13,000,000 Google hits!

Good seeing ""Gabel statt Skalpell - Gesnder leben ohne Fleisch"" out in German.
Amazon.de has 38 five star rave reviews. Give them time for hundreds more.

PRAGMATIC GUIDE TO EVALUATING CLAIMS:

(1) When the experts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain;
(2) When they are not agreed, no opinion can be taken as certain by non-experts;
and
(3) When they all hold that no sufficient grounds for a positive opinion exist, the ordinary man would do well to suspend his judgment. Bertrand Russell - Let the People Think (1941)

Two people are inside the character for meat.

Meanwhile portraying these ex-meat-farmer doctors as the perfect examples of health and well-being because they eat lettuce, eggplant and 'legumes'.  Watch them ride a bike, or lift weights...and tell you that they are SOOO happy and healthy.

4555450,5,B0053ZHZI2,"My husband and I watched this over the Christmas holiday and decided to give it a try.  This movie really spoke to us at a time when we were looking to improve our diet.  We are in our mid-thirties and he had to have surgery twice last summer to remove a large and painful kidney stone.  We learned after analysis of it that it was caused by too much acid in his diet.  This lead me on a journey to find a better diet for us and our two children.  When I kept seeing Forks Over Knives mentioned on various websites, I knew we had to check it out.

We were completely blown away by the information it provided and decided we would quit meat and dairy cold turkey and switch to a plant based diet.  What's the worse that could happen, right?  If we didn't feel good, we could always switch back.  So we committed to a one month trial.

Three months later, we are still sticking to our new plant strong diet and the results have been nothing short of amazing.  I cannot even begin to express to you how much better we feel.  We have more energy, my mental clarity has increased to levels I didn't know I was capable of experiencing, we sleep better, and we have each lost weight....my husband is down 22 lbs so far and I am down 9 lbs.  The mid-day slumps I used to experience are also now completely gone.  I no longer need a nap to help me get through the day.

My husband works in law enforcement and is required to go for an annual health screening as part of his job.  We were expecting good results when he went in yesterday because of our diet change but the numbers still blew us away.  Even the nurse was amazed by the change in his numbers over the previous year and said it was the best numbers she had seen all day.  Here's how his results looked:

Blood Pressure:
Last year - 116/89 (considered pre-hypertension)
This year - 114/76 (now in the normal range)

Total Cholesterol:
Last year - 176
This year - 114

HDL (Good) Cholesterol:
Last year - 43 (anything around 40 is considered dangerously low and 60 or higher is good)
This year - 76

Body Composition:
Last year - 30.7% (considered obese)
This year - 19.1% (considered the healthy range for his age)

Was changing hard?  A little.  I had to learn a new way to cook but there are so many great plant based recipe sites and cookbooks out there.  I highly recommend Oh She Glows, Happy Herbivore, and if you have kids...Peas and Thank You has some great recipes for families.  All three have blogs and the latter two have great cookbooks which are for sale here on Amazon.

We don't look at eating this way as deprivation.  I think you have to go into a change like this with a positive attitude or you will set yourself up for failure.  We focus on all the great things we can eat, not the stuff we no longer want to.

I should also mention that we eat wild Alaskan salmon a couple times a month and I do use a little olive oil in our food occasionally (which isn't recommended by the movie).  I think everyone needs to make changes that they feel will work for them otherwise it's hard to stick with it.  If you don't think you can be meat or dairy free 100% of the time, try 90%, or 75%, or 50% or whatever works for you.  Even smaller changes can make a big difference to your overall health and well being.

I have since shared this documentary with family and friends who were impressed with the positive changes we experienced and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to make a change to their health and the way they feel.  Thank you Dr. Esselstyn and Dr. Campbell for giving our family a new lease on life!

After watching the film, I read ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"", ""The China Study"" and ""Dr. Neal Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes: The Scientifically Proven System for Reversing Diabetes without Drugs"". Then I changed my diet completely and joined the others that have been so impacted by the message in this film.

It's an alternating series of scientific and anecdotal evidence advocating a ""whole-foods, plant-based diet"". The term vegan is almost never used, which is perhaps wise given the amount of baggage that term carries. It focuses heavily on cancer and heart disease, which is very timely; modern healthcare struggles to address lifestyle-related illness, and these are the big public health menaces of the 21st century. As a lifelong vegetarian myself (who eats no meat but plenty of dairy products), I was struck by the amount of negative evidence relating to animal protein of any source, as well as being reminded of the perhaps surprising abundance of oft-neglected plant protein.

What this movie does not do much of is address other aspects of health and disease, compare other ""healthy"" diets to the WFPBD they advocate, or discuss economic, environmental, ethical, or other aspects of veganism. Focusing mostly on the health angle is a perfectly valid choice, but the viewer needs to understand that this one documentary is not a comprehensive treatise on how to choose one's diet.

It also doesn't talk much about actually implementing the diet (i.e. how to cook vegan, how to transition from another diet), but this topic has been covered elsewhere, including in subsequent material by the company behind this movie.

All in all, it's probably an eye-opener for anyone who eats something like the Standard American Diet; worth seeing for anyone interested in eating better.",1364083200,,1705,5.122302158273381

Your getting degenerative diseases because the food supply is intentionally poisoned.

1) Fluoride in the water supply. Also Chlorine. These have been rejected in Europe.
2) GMO foods - these will wreak havoc in the health of people as the years progress
3) Chemicals and additives
  a) aspartame
  b) hi-fructose corn syrup
  c) MSG
  d) others
4) Cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation are toxic to your health.
5) Most surgeries are unnecessary
6) Virtually all prescription medication should be avoided. Food and Supplement based alternatives are far healthier.
7) Most important- avoid all vaccines. These have done enormous damage to the population especially in the area of chronic diseases.

GMO ballot questions in WA and CA were defeated thru ballot rigging.

Outside of cuts and bruises and some emergencies, conventional medical system should be avoided because it is dangerous to your health. Alternative health is also much cheaper.

For heart disease and stroke prevention - use fibrolytic enzymes e.g. nattokinase, serrapeptase (they work)
For intestinal and bowel disorders e.g. diverticulitous, IBS - use Aloe mucilaginous polysaccharide
For kidney stones - dissolve them naturally - no surgery with herbs
For colds - zinc
immune support - cat's claw extract
weight control - CLA

4555495,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This is a fabulously educational piece about how to improve (radically !) the measure of our health.  And the avenue is learning and then implementing a change in what food we put into our bodies.  We, in our culture, have been taught SO many things about food as we grow up that are just so plain wrong.  You combine that fundamental fact with how many things have changed in recent years with all the lobbying interests, the escalation in marketing techniques, plus the agribusiness forces and it has led to the vast majority of our population just having no idea how we are causing most of the serious and/or chronic physical conditions we are afflicted with.  Yet this video is not fear-mongering in its approach.  It is encouraging, empowering, and inspiring.  It's told by a journalist who got a serious diagnosis himself, and set off to research what there was to learn.  This led him to a number of very wise people, but especially two exceptional, 70-something, with-impressive-vitality, still-practicing doctors who hadn't known each other but whose research and life-long experience (and this journalist ?) brought a convergence of their paths.  The film follows the progress of about 6-8 patients working with one or the other doctor -- to extremely gratifying results.  The patients experience much, though not terribly difficult, change .. what with their determination which was sustained by enormously improving health, weight, and, ultimately, the very course of their lives (and life expectancy).  And we, the viewer, get to SEE the changes in their appearance and HEAR them talk about the changes in how they feel and how their lifestyles have changed.  As I said, it is SO encouraging, SO inspiring, and SO empowering !!!  Would that we could get a copy of this DVD delivered into every household in our country !

We in the US consume roughly 10 times more animal protein than the plant based regions in the study.

There are 500,000 bypass operations performed in the US every year. The China study data supports the assertion that almost all of atherosclerosis disease can be prevented by a change from an animal based diet to a plant based diet.

Colin Campbell estimates that 70 to 80% of US medical costs can be eliminated by a change from an animal based based diet to plant based diet. Cambell's research is supported by thousands of people who have changed their diet, including myself.

Based on Campbell's and other's research, I eliminate steaks, chicken, dairy, cheese, and dairy from my diet. I am now eating a plant based diet and enjoying it. My blood pressure is optimum. I sleep better. My arthritis symptoms have disappeared.

I do not understand why there any negative comments concerning Forks over Knifes. I would assume that the negative comments are due to an estimate reduction in health care costs of 80%.

Ten years ago my husband was in a malnutrition coma, because of severe complications after mistreatment of gum disease. After three months in the hospital I was told by the group of nine doctors that were seeing him that nothing else could be done and I had to take him either home or to a hospice because he was not responding. My husband, nine months before, was 200 pounds, and six foot tall, today he was still same height but 119 pounds!!  After research and inquiries I asked the Gastroenterologist to have a feeding tube put into his stomach before I could take him home. It was not easy to convince him but he finally agreed and I took my husband home, comatose and with a feeding tube. Ten years later, my husband is still my best friend, he is still alive and enjoying brainy conversations, an intellectual life, friends and hopefully also me. How did this happen?  Food did it, and at the moment I did not realize that I never put animal protein into that tube. I used to cook and blend the food that would go into the tube, never used the commercial liquids that the hospital send me home with.  He had many, other problems later on, however, medications have been minimal and he is well. Some of his MD's used to call me the witch, because they couldn't figure out how I was doing it, but I was doing it right.

4555530,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Great documentary.  I often let people borrow it because I truly believe in its message.

4555533,3,B0053ZHZI2,The caliber of the movie just seemed a little off - that said the content of the benefits of diet came through loud and clear and were appreciated,1362873600,,146,4.25
4555534,5,B0053ZHZI2,"First watched this documentary quite by accident on Netflix. It is extremely informative. We then decided to purchase the DVD to share with friends. Love the research that is explained how and why this meal plan was developed. Also love the stories of the people whose lives have been changed and saved by this food program. We adopted this meal plan in mid-January and it has changed my life. I recommend the program and recipes to everyone. I was diagnosed with RA almost four years ago. Since following this meal plan starting in mid-January, I am completely pain free. Doctors say there is no cure for RA. Maybe there isn't a cure, but this diet plan certainly eliminates the pain of RA or it has for me. I never took prescription meds for the RA, used herbs, vitamins and minerals, and they helped tremendously with inflammation and pain. However, it was only after I adopted this meal plan that the pain totally disappeared. I will never go back to eating the Standard American Diet (SAD). One of the women featured in the companion Engine 2 Diet documentary was changing to this plan in hopes of getting off all her RA medications. I sincerely hope she was successful. I know this program has made a tremendous change in my life",1362873600,,1235,4.6438356164383565
4555535,5,B0053ZHZI2,"The 90 minute film is so interesting that I did not leave my seat once it started!  Forks Over Knives invites you into the lives and passions of individual professionals who each took a look at differing dietary influences in people who came down with various diseases.  It was only after they each had come to similar conclusions that they became aware of each other.  I was very impressed with the changes the dietary approach can make in limiting and eliminating some diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and reflux.  It was encouraging to see how people were able to come off most of their medications after just 3 months when they followed the recommendations of these doctors.

This film has completely changed how I look at food.  And, the only reason I watched it was because my sister's cardiologist recommended it for her!

Do yourself a favor and watch this film; then share it with all the people you love.",1362873600,,930,4.703703703703703
4555536,5,B0053ZHZI2,The research is compelling. It is sad that the general public is not informed. This made me rethink my eating and cooking habits for life!,1362873600,,138,4.56
4555537,2,B0053ZHZI2,"This is one of the most one-sided documentaries I think I've ever seen, at least among ones that act like they're scientific. I think they devoted all of 1 minute to people who disagreed with their conclusions and presented absolutely zero data to the contrary. If you take this at its word, you would think that the science is 100% conclusive and a glass of milk is about as dangerous as a pack of cigarettes. And that there's a giant conspiracy among drug companies, agribusiness, government, and doctors to hide the evidence. Switching to a vegan diet is an almost instant cure for heart disease and cancer. If your doctor doesn't tell you to go vegan, he must be in the back pocket of the drug companies.

As someone who works in scientific research (not medicine or biology) I guess I tend to be a little more skeptical. The evidence is clear that the Western diet is definitely bad for your health, the support for the idea that it's necessary to completely eliminate everything but plants is lot more tenuous. The movie mentions scientific studies, but it seems to draw mostly on anecdotal evidence for its conclusions. While I'm sure it did work for those people, you can't use them to say it will work for everyone. It also has several completely unsupported assertions. They say to avoid processed foods like HFCS but don't really say why. If animal products are the only problem as they suggest, then surely HFCS and refined soybean oil should be perfectly fine.

It lumps fish and poultry in with beef and pork in saying that all meat is bad for you. It doesn't say anything about GMO crops or pesticides.

It does more to encourage a discussion rather than acting like it's settled science that you should just accept.",1362787200,9,2086,5.058139534883721

With a family history of diabetes and heart disease, it really opened my eyes. The possibility of avoiding the vast array of drugs my parents use is appealing enough to make significant changes to my diet. While I have already taken great strides by eliminating most processed foods, this video has convinced me to go even further by eliminating meat and dairy.

We gave up raw dairy products such as milk, cream, butter, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, cheese and eggs.  We haven't eaten meat (beef, pork, lamb, poultry, or fish) in over a year, and we feel better because of it.

The concept of animal protein and highly processed foods being a major contributor to many of our crippling ailments such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertention, and cancer is reason enough to invest a couple hours of your time to watch this video.  The concept of a plant-based diet is a nobrainer and I have started incorporating more raw fruits and vegetables in my diet. While I may not become completey vegetarian or vegan I have dramactially reduced my intake of meat and dairy and strive for the majortiy of my meals to come from fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes. I have lost 7 lbs in one month just by reducing dairy and gluten and eliminating processed food and excess sugar. I drink green drinks in the morning (kale, spinach, carrots, apple and almond milk), lots of water and I exercise 3 days a week.

4555618,5,B0053ZHZI2,"It's a very engaging documentary.  And I can add my personal story that the lifestyle works. I really don't understand why people continue to eat meat. It's not good for the planet -- takes excessive resources and is highly polluting. It's not good for people -- millions are undernourished while we ""fatten"" animals. It's not good for the animals -- they don't go calmly and willingly to their deaths, and in fact many do suffer inhumanmane treatment. It's not good for society -- the medical costs from such diseases are enormous. And it's not good for our own personal health.  So to answer the question of why do you eat meat with ""because I like it,"" suddenly looks very unconsidered and selfish.  This film explains this in much greater and more eloquent detail.

She used the diet from this film, along with traditional medical treatment, acupuncture, oxygenated water, exercise & similar holistic aids. She did not lose her hair during chemo.  Scans 14 months later showed ""no active cancer"".

You can imagine just how happy those words from her physician made all of us who love her. The diet was one part of a multifaceted approach to the happy words ""no active cancer"".  You may be sure my daughter will continue to combine the wisdom of this film along with the best that conventional and holistic medicine have to offer, so we can all keep hearing the joyous words of her physician, NO ACTIVE CANCER!

Sure, some of its content may be controversial, but the message the video presents is something every person should hear and consider.

But even Ghee is used ONLY in medicinal treatment in low dosages and mostly for applications like in nostrils or so, but never recommended for regular consumption with normal food.

I am going to give this a try, because I have been having some nagging health problems, and although I was aware of Ayurveda's principles, I neglected them considering impractical to follow in the 21st century, but this movie is an eye-opener, and I am going to go back to my roots (now that they have been YET AGAIN proved by the modern day research)!",1359331200,,810,4.912408759124087

I am not a baby cow. Even baby cows stop drinking cows milk when they grow up. Our digestive tracts are made for grain consumption. Not really for meat, but as omnivores they will do it.

4555701,4,B0053ZHZI2,"So I really enjoy learning about health, especially ways to improve human health naturally without the use of symptom treaters (most modern medicine) that are so prevalent in the US today. Therefore I really enjoyed this documentary because it directly discusses this topic. I started researching ways to improve my health about 4 years ago when I was dealing with some mild health problems. I always thought I knew how to stay healthy, and one of the key methods I used to stay healthy since I was a teenager was exercising regularly. However, I have a saying that I live by which is ""I'm very curious about the things I don't know."" And with that in mind I realized that while my exercise knowledge was decent, my nutrition knowledge wasn't so great. So rather than relying on sporadic articles in the fitness magazines I read at the time, I went a little deeper and ordered some books that seemed to be very informative and focused on some health issues I was dealing with. Those books were The Mood Cure by Julia Ross, The Ultramind Solution by Dr. Mark Hyman, and The Edge Effect by Dr. Braverman. I also ordered and read through Eat Right for your (Blood) Type by Dr. JD'Adamo, but in the end I found the research too lacking in that book (eh, if the book is telling me to avoid certain vegetables and fruits, it should at least layout the clinical studies backing this claim, or make them available online, which it doesn't).

  Okay, so back to this documentary. The common thread I found weaving through the books by Ross, Hyman, and Braverman is that health issues very often have their roots in our diet, lifestyle, and environment. So these three areas are crucial to address to see dramatic improvement in our lives...NOT through modern medicine (or at the very least not solely through modern medicine). So there is congruency between this documentary and that concept. And these three books also HIGHLY emphasize the importance of a healthy diet, and Ross in particular does an excellent job of describing what to consume and what to avoid.

  And this is where their research is a bit at odds with this documentary. This documentary seems to convey the vegan diet is the way to go...eat all the whole plant foods you want but avoid all animal protein. But the books by Ross, Hyman, and Braverman, although highly emphasizing the importance of a whole plant foods diet, don't go so far as to state that all meat and dairy products must be avoided. In some instances animal protein is even recommended in the three books, especially regarding fish sources of omega 3's (e.g. sardines).

Reading exercise and health literature over the years, I've learned it is not uncommon to find conflicting research. And it doesn't mean that everything that one camp claims (or vice versa) is the whole truth. Regarding an ideal human diet, I think a statement from Dr. Hyman's book sums it up quite well:  ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" And it makes sense to me. I see the human body evolving over time by our ancient ancestors living (probably not always by choice) by this guideline...foraging for roots, vegetables, fruits, nuts, berries...getting fish when they could...and getting fast food when they could (e.g. some animal speeding through the jungle).

  So I don't intend on eliminating all animal protein from my diet, especially because I exercise consistently. On most days I'll have 3 eggs in the morning, sardines for lunch, and a whey protein shake for dinner. And the last time I went to the doctor and had my bloodwork done (I am very curious) he said I was probably the healthiest patient he had.

  And I think it is very important to emphasize, as some other reviewers have, the importance of unique body chemistry. Although a vegan lifestyle might work great for some folks, it may not work all that well for others. I'm surprised this wasn't really emphasized in the documentary either. Google the topic ""mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians""...you'll most likely come across at least one article that is very interesting which indicates a vegan diet is not the best diet for heart health.",1358640000,,4130,4.790436005625879

4555714,5,B0053ZHZI2,"If you consider yourself in any way conscious of your health on a life-long scale, please watch the documentary called ""Forks over Knives"". Tonight I'm watching it for the 3rd time.  It details how the American diet with it's high meat, sugar, dairy, and eggs is causing
Americans to become a nation full of diabetics, obese people, and who are now more dependent than ever on prescription medications such as Lipitor for lowering cholesterol.

You may not know it but high cholesterol levels lead to heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes.  Since the 1960s when fast food and supermarkets began to become a normal part of American living heart disease has been on a steady and frightening  rise.

In the beginning of the 20th century, around 1900, Americans ate about 120 lbs of meat annually.  By 2007 that figure had exploded to 220 lbs of meat per person.  In 1913 we ate about 40 lbs of processed sugar per year.  By 1999 our consumption of  unrefined sugar had risen to 147 lbs.  In 1909 Americans consumed 242 lbs of dairy products a piece, such a cheese, milk, ice cream, etc.  By 2006 our yearly intake had doubled to 605 lbs per person, per year.

We are now one of the fattest, sickest nations on earth.  This particular documentary aims to re-educate people that adopting a plant-based diet is the only way that will effectively save our lives, lead to longer healthier existences, reverse and eliminate Type II Diabetes, and help avoid heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.  It is now understood by scientists that cancers caused by faulty genes accounts for only 1% of cancers in the US.  The rest is caused by life-style choices, poor diet, lack of exercise, and eating a diet largely based on animal based foods such as meat, eggs, diary, and sugar.

The problem most people have a difficult time bending their minds around a plant-based diet is protein.  "" If I don't eat meat, where will I get it?""  The big beef and dairy industries spend billions of dollars a year on advertising campaigns that brainwash the average American into believing that  that meat and dairy should not only comprise a large portion of the food we consume, but that without it our health will truly suffer.

It is now understood, however, that plants such as spinach, broccoli, yams and many others have just as much protein as meat with zero cholesterol to hurt your arteries and heart.  Cholesterol is ONLY found in animal-based foods.  It is very similar to the plaque you find in between your teeth when you floss - white, sticky, and it adheres itself to your inner arteries, blocking the blood flow to your heart which will ultimately lead to heart bypass surgery for some (over 500,000 Americans annually), stroke, or death.

So what is the answer?  According to the documentary Forks over Knives it is imperative that in order to avoid cancer, type II Diabetes, heart attacks, chronic fatigue, and stroke people must adopt a plant-based diet for life.  That means no meat, eggs, dairy, or sugar.  Since the 1950's scientists have discovered that there is a real causal link between the animal-based foods we eat and the diseases we will develop later in life, which include heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and many obesity-related illness such a hypertension, and erectile dysfunction.  Yes, erectile dysfuntion.  Our bodies are not compartmentalized.  If you are having circulatory issues in any part of your body due to diet or disease, one of the first indications that things are seriously wrong is that blood flow to the extremities, including the penis, has been compromised. It's not so much an inconvenience as it is warning sign that there are serious issues brewing in your body that you may not yet be aware of.

So what does it mean to eat a plant-based diet?  It means consuming minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains.  Processed foods such as bleached flower, oils, and refined sugars should be limited or completely avoided.  It is a misconception that the lack of animal proteins in our diets  lead to the lack of amino acids that are responsible for muscle repair, cell growth, and overall health. L

Large scales studies  from the 1950's onwards have found that nutrients from animal based sources promote cancer growth, while nutrients from plant-based sources discourage cancer growth.

The naysayers are obviously people who have never lived on a whole foods plant based diet.  This isn't a gimmick and not even a quick weightloss trick, it's a clean way of life and a transition I wish I had made years ago.  I didn't make the change because I wanted to lose weight, but because I'm almost 48 years old and felt heavy ""inside"" my body.  All the years of butter, cheese and dairy just had me feeling heavy. I was always an avid meat eater, never believing I could live without cheese and butter--I loved butter so much I could just drink it.  I was a bodybuilder and for years believed in a low carb diet and the myth that I needed meat for protein. After 2-1/2 months of living on a whole foods plant based diet I can honestly say that I NEVER want to go back to dairy, meat or sugar. I feel fantastic, my skin is glowing and I no longer suffer from constant congestion.  I've lost 7 pounds and even my doctor was amazed at the results of my labwork after just one month. On a low carb diet I would always crave sugar and starches and end up having a massive binge every couple of weeks.  Not once have I craved anything except fruits and vegetables since beginning a whole foods plant based way of life. Mentally, I occasionally miss salmon and goat cheese but nothing else. I did not eliminate extra virgin olive oil and nuts from my diet as I do not have heart disease and in good health. Every person who is addicted to food should watch this video. Eliminate the artificial sweeteners and foods with added sugar and you'll be amazed--cravings for sugar will vanish.

After watching the video, we were astounded that not only do they not give us those benefits but that we're hastening the leeching of calcium from our bodies by ingesting those stuff. And that is just ONE condition out of the many conditions that eating meat and dairy causes. The solution is just so simple, yet we have been led to believe that meat/dairy is a necessity. What we're just doing is making sure hospitals and pharmaceuticals don't run out of business. If you experience any pain in your body right now or want perfect health, you must watch this.

If you have watched this movie and find it has blown your mind, try researching it and you will find out what utter lies it is. Wow! The only merit this movie has is waking up the complete ignorant to the fact that fruits and vegetables are good. The one hinge this movie has that keeps you watching is the claim that animal protein causes cancer. After watching this part i immediately asked myself ""Milk protein isn't in a rats diet, is it? Thats completely and utterly foreign to them, right? And how much is 20% of their diet? Turns out that it is of course not in a rats diet and the 20% they were giving the rats is the equivalent of eating 250 peanut butter sandwiches a day. The study didn't mention the rats on 5% protein DIED sooner than those on 20%, nor did it say anything about the same study done on monkeys and where the monkeys who ate 5% caesine got ill due to lack of protein. It amazes me how Americans believe anything doctors say. In the shocking study done on rats who ate 20% caisin, though they did develop tumors 30 survived to 12 that ate 5% animal protein after 1 year!! The lack of protein caused other terminal complications. Again, 30 survived on animal protein even though it is utterly foreign to their normal rat diet, to 12 that survived on 5% animal protein being their only source of protein after 1 year!!

The correlations is this movie were so loose it should be used as an example of how disinformation is spread. Norway is used as an example of how when the Nazi's took norwegian livestock away their health improved because they turned to a plant based diet. Nevermind the fact the norwegians caloric intake plumeted due to food rationing by the Nazi, they turned to fish rich in omega 3, and teburculosis was a major killer so you were too young to see heart disease.

Same goes for the China study. They leave out fish. And other correlations that don't suit the agenda of the film.

I also love how they characterize the ""American diet"" as fast food restaurants and hamburgers, bacon dogs, and donuts. Only watch this movie if you think fast food is food, you don't know what vegetables are, or you don't know why you are over weight.",1357603200,20,2249,4.440677966101695

My only gripe with The China Study and Forks Over Knives is that they are heavily biased towards vegetarianism. I don't believe you have to boycott meat to be healthy as long as it's from an organic, free-range, grass fed source (which is both rare and expensive to find.)

The high ratings on this movie drew me in - what's a wellness nerd not to love? But the ad-like introduction and the tone of the arguments - defensive, unbalanced - made me wonder early on. Then, when they started cherry-picking countries to compare against the U.S. (why not have a larger sample?) I became skeptical of the filmmakers' methods. I started Googling, and found the NYTimes review saying it was pedantic but persuasive (but with no mention of the science), so I kept going. Raw Food SOS had probably the most thorough analysis I've seen: [...], which moderates the film's claims considerably. Do your homework before you start tossing good food out of your diet. You know what really cheesed me off? They put a picture of a salmon steak in their 'evil-meat montage' precisely when they said, ""even foods you think are good for you.""

He had stint surgery and lost a ton of weight.  Clinton was on a plant based diet. (to see the video search the terms: Esselstyn blitzer clinton cnn.)  I immediately ordered Dr Esselstyn's book, along with the China Study and others.  Then, as I was preparing to go on this plant based diet, I had a transient aneurysm, which is your body giving you a ""warning shot across the bow.""

Many of us have tried various diets.  For me it was counting calories or even Atkins.  I wasn't grossly overweight, but I did acquire Type II diabetes.  Dr. Esselstyn's work (along with others) have been life changing for me.  I am off all but one medicine.  We can reverse heart disease and Type II diabetes.  What I love about the plant based diet is you don't count calories.  Eat the amount your body needs.  Two years ago my doctor said I should at least eat fish and some cheese for calcium.  He too has changed.  He now recommends ALL of his Type II diabetic patients adopt a plant based diet.  We may not live in Iran, but there is still much propaganda in the United States; especially from the USDA.  Look at their board members.  See how Monsanto and their genetically modified organisms (GMO) are almost above the law.  Search these keywords: Monsanto, FDA, USDA

The more knowledge you get, the better you can control your diet.  For example, eating a hearty pumpernickel is soooooooo much better than white or wheat bread.  The more complex the carbohydrate, the less sugar and more fiber.  Fiber passes through us.  Sugar gets absorbed.  I encourage you to read books and research on this subject.  Your life depends on it.",1356739200,4,3702,6.823027718550106

4555775,3,B0053ZHZI2,"I consider myself an independent thinker so I enjoyed this documentary very much.  First the bad:  I don't think the breast cancer survivor was necessarily a good example (although I am thrilled for her success) and the reason is this:  there are different kinds of breast cancer and there are different protocols for different types. Now, only recently, have oncologists begun to admit that they are treating many breast cancers over-aggressively and that some types of breast cancer may benefit from mastectomy or lumpectomy without additional radiation and/or chemo.  So it may not have been her plant-based diet that healed her.  Also, she was in great shape before the cancer, and continued to be physically fit afterwards, all of which gave her a recovery advantage over someone who didn't mind their weight or exercise at time of diagnosis and subsequently.  So I don't think she was a good example and in fact it may be dangerous to use her as an example.

Recent studies have indicated that obesity is so dangerous to our health, that it's better to eat crap and be thin then to eat healthfully and be fat!  Obviously a person who eats healthfully AND is thin is optimal!

No mention is made of the necessity for supplements on an all-vegan diet.  Your body will be deficient in vitamin B12 if you go on a strictly vegan diet.  And no mention is made of D3, either.  Also, they say ""no oil"" but olive oil is beneficial to one's health - - they need to distinguish that there are ""good"" fats and ""bad"" fats versus NO fats!  And now there is much thought that eating soy-based products may not be so great either due to high estrogen, not to mention GMOs.  So where does it all end?

Another point:  eating an all-vegan diet is extremely time-consuming.  It takes a lot of time to prepare appetizing vegetable dishes - lots of washing, peeling, dicing, chopping, etc.  There are few shortcuts realistically speaking.  So people who live a harried lifestyle are going to have to find at least 1 - 2 hours extra in their day for meal preparation if you want a lot of variety in a vegan diet and visual/ taste appeal.

Finally, there is no question that everyone, and I mean everyone, has biases, no matter what side of the fence you are on and no matter what scientific studies report, because the reports are always skewed.  In China, there is no question that a more Western diet has changed things, but there are so many other factors affecting health in China today such as appalling work conditions in factories, people who once lived in the country now living in cities and exerting themselves less physically, and the huge amount of industrial and environmental pollution in China today, along with utter disregard for workplace and environmental hazards.  Also, people living in remote areas of China are far less likely to have access to advanced care for serious maladies and terminal diseases, and are less likely to be diagnosed promptly, or even have the disease reported accurately.  So I even question the accuracy of the atlas of disease as published.

That said . . . I think it is time for Americans to eat more healthfully and lose weight and get off their computers and get outside.  Unfortunately eating organic is today an elitist activity because the cost is much higher.  Compare the cost of a family of 5 eating at McDonalds vs. the cost of eating an all-organic vegan meal, plus the time necessary to prepare it, and you will understand why families eat ""fast food"", no matter how reprehensible.

There is no doubt that Type II diabetes is reversible (although it will probably reoccur when someone becomes elderly) with diet and exercise, but while we can fight against cancer with diet, any oncologist will tell you that at the end of the day, it is simply unclear why some people who are diagnosed survive this disease and others succumb.  There are just too many factors in terms of what causes cancer, who gets it, and why, and who survives and who dies, to say it is strictly based on diet.  But it cannot hurt to eat mindfully, consciously and conscientiously and healthfully, and that means not eating crap, processed foods, chemically enhanced foods, etc. and reducing portion size.

I do recommend the Forks Over Knives cookbook. Even if you cannot commit to veganism, the recipes offer some truly delicious additions to your diet.",1356652800,4,4372,4.744708994708994

4555799,3,B0053ZHZI2,"The film is OK but frankly it is not so much as what they are trying to say but how they are saying it. They often use misleading information and leave out significant information that could help their arguments.

Make no mistake there are compelling reasons to at the very least consume less processed foods, especially processed low quality meats. However, the film makes too many assumptions that would otherwise be taken out if this was presented in a academic fashion. For example the claim on carbon emissions neglects the fact that not everyone lives near areas of ample food production, especially when you factor winters in. Avocados were seen in the film. They do not grow these in the northeast so am I or anyone in the region not to buy them? They are confusing a vegetarian diet with a localvore diet. There are countless plants and veggies shipped to all the corners of the earth and to suggest this does not have some environmental impact is a huge and serious logical flaw. On the other side they could have added that the wastes of food could better be composted with a fruit/vegetable diet over that of one with meats as compost is not supposed to have any animal byproducts.

With regards to the China study there are several factors that frankly were not recognized rendering some of it questionable. First and foremost is that the maps that were shown indicating the rates of heart diseases and cancers were in higher populated areas so of course they would have a higher rate. The coastal areas (Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) are very large cities.  Why does this matter? Well because the urbanization has led to some significant pollution. I know this because I have been there. Granted they are gradually creating more standards. Food is just ONE part of health. Exercise and environment also play significant roles. You could eat a perfect diet but if you don't exercise and live next to a coal plant or have a job as a waiter in a cigar bar chances are you will not be as healthy as you think. Speaking of which cigarette use is still significantly high in asia to the point where it is like going back in time to the 1970s! I have personally seen cigarettes on dinner menus there! Secondly is that of course they would not have that much in the way of consumption of meats. Governmental policies dramatically limited food production leading the starvation of 30 MILLION people (some say as many as 76 million) just search about the famine for yourself. Third dairy consumption in much of the planet outside the western world runs into the fact that being lactose in tolerate is a factor (in Asian countries this can be as high as 90%). Who would eat something if they knew it would make them sick? That would be like using native american tribes on a study about alcohol consumption!

They could have used a much better example of diet by looking at American Samoa and influences of the Latter Day Saints (Mormons). A vast majority in American Samoa are obese. The major reasons being is that western diets in particular with processed meats (cough*spam*cough) and white bread significantly contributed to this. With Mormons a 24 year UCLA study illustrated that the refraining of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine contributed to a nearly 10 year difference in life spans (white men).

Can it be possible that those in the film lowered their cholesterol and weight? Possibly but that's not a real scientific claim enough to validate it. The other major issue with the film is that frankly it does not fully address some of the other issues. The most basic being is that should a market be established to create meat substitutes? To go directly from meat eater to non meat eater might be more acceptable if there was a taste AND texture similar(ex Morningstar Grillers Prime Burgers). If the answer to this is yes then frankly the cost structure is way too high in some areas. Soy/Almond milk costs nearly 3-4 times ounce for ounce what a gallon of dairy milk would cost. Like it or not much of the ""western diet"" is based on subsidized food which is quite cheap. For many to go from a regular supermarket to whole foods or trader joes might not really work financially.

The second main issue is that frankly it makes the assumption that all meats are ""western"". This is assumed to be beef, chicken and pork (where's fish?!?). Yet other meats like rabbit, venison, mutton, alligator, buffalo, ostridge, camel are not really within the same class and frankly were not mentioned. So frankly the concept of ""western"" vs non western does not exactly fit well.

Lastly should crops themselves change to accommodate this shift? In asia they produce rise year round while in the USA and Canada corn is preferred (also due to the HFCS and ethanol (which also was left out of the film). Corn has to be rotated as it takes massive amounts of nitrogen out of soil. In asia they do not really have to do that. So with that in mind how can the market really work on this if everyone switched? There are also other animal products not mentioned like leather. An ethical dilemma could be ascertained in that if one replaces an animal product with a energy product (oil/plastics) that it simply trading one for the other.

Again a basic argument can be made in that going to a plant based diet can be better for you. But to go on some of these tangents that the film has is like watching a summer movie preview during the superbowl. It doesn't really fit and frankly served no purpose. It is one thing to suggest that changing a diet would change weight (possible but also needs exercise) but making anti heart disease and cancer claims is going a bit far. In order for this to be truly reliable and valid there would have to be significant amounts of people already with heart disease to go on these diets for years on end rather than just a few dozens (say tens of thousands).",1354924800,,5898,4.64272030651341

4555822,4,B0053ZHZI2,"This movie was very informative. I would tend to agree that eating ""whole"" foods is paramount to ones health. My one question regarding their ""high animal product diet = cancer"" is this. What explains the EXTREMELY negligible cancer rates in indigenous populations that eat almost ENTIRELY animal based products, such as the eskimos, and other northern dwelling peoples?

I tend to think that it is HOW we are raising our meat, GMO's, antibiotics, disgusting slaughterhouse practices and the proliferation of processed foods that is truly the culprit-not animal products themselves. If they cannot explain these populations with such low cancer rates while eating almost entirely animals, it completely negates their hypothesis.",1353974400,8,728,5.558558558558558

Even if we slowly change over to vegetable diet, its better then none.  With all the cancer and diabetics going on, you have to be stupid to not give it a try. Save yourself from all those medical bills and try it.

One thing they forgot to mention is that chickens are full of steroids now-a-days. And steroids had known to cause suicide and depression. I know this cause I saw it on a video of how chicken are raised, they inject them with so much steroids that the chicken couldn't even walk themselves to the their food bowl to eat.

The movie is a great addition to the book in the sense that it approaches the topic from a wider perspective and includes studies and evidence by other scientists and medical practitioners. This is a great ""casual"" primer for people who might be interested in the solid scientific evidence behind a plant based diet. I highly recommend this video and often invite friends over for a conversation provoking ""movie night"" with this DVD as the main attraction.

PS: prior to reading Campbell's book 2 years ago I was ""sold"" on the false belief that in order to be healthy on NEEDED to consume large quantities of animal based protein.  2 years later I have eliminated 80-90% of animal product from my diet and feel just as strong and healthy as I did when was more carnivorous. The biggest difference I have noticed is energy levels that are more consistent throughout the day and a slight loss of bodyfat (from 185# / 12% bodyfat to same weight but 10% bodyfat). However, it's the long term health effects that I maded the change for (reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease rates among whole food practitioners).",1353283200,,1184,4.799019607843137

This book makes it clear that our food industry, in bed with the FDA and government has catered to its own interests, not that of the health of Americans. The food pyramid we were taught in elementery and high school showed our protein needs satisfied only by a thick juicy steak, whole chickens and dairy products. That is completely backward. ""Forks Over Knives"" clearly proves that ALL of our nutrient needs are satisfied with a high nutrient, low calorie diet, composed mostly of green leafy vegetables, fruits, beans, and legumes. America is almost half obese now, and getting worse. People cannot lose weight because of the false information we were taught early on and continues today.

4555888,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I am 23 years old, and became a vegan during my freshman year of college at the age of 19. I have spent the past 4 1/2 years researching the vegan lifestyle, with many ups and downs. I am so happy that Forks Over Knives came out. In just 1.5 hours, this documentary provides an outstanding, convincing health-centered argument for a plant-based diet. I feel more secure than ever in my decision to be a low fat vegan, and now I have a wonderful resource to share with my friends and family. My 22 year old brother has given me grief about my lifestyle for years. I almost cried when he called to tell me that he watched the FOK documentary, and that he wanted to eat the way that I do. The CEO of my boyfriend's robotics engineering company became a vegan because of this documentary, and currently my copy of the DVD is circulating my boyfriend's office. I believe that this documentary vindicates everything that I have attempted to do, rather blindly I might add, for the past 4 years, and I believe that it marks a tipping point in food culture in the United States. This documentary changes people's lives every day, and I am proud to help spread the word.

* What we eat will effect our health
* A) America is eating too much protein, B) There are other protein options outside of Animal protein
* Cow dairy is the opposite of healthy
* The idea that disease is genetic is tested, the film notes that prevention and reversal is possible by moving to a plant based diet.

At first you get left with, so what is left for me to eat?  Today in most markets across the US you now have so many great options that are avail.

When it arrived, I showed my husband and suggested we sit down together to watch since he's always feeling uncomfortable with his weight and in his clothes and really wants to make a change.  Also I'm concerned about his very high cholesterol.  However after explaining a little bit about it, he quickly rejected it and argued it was most likely made by the ""PETA people"" or those ""crazy people at the Vegetarian Society"".  After becoming aggravated with him and saying ""I give up""...I sat down to watch it with my sister.  We thought it was great and certainly made a lot of sense to us.  She already eats a plant-based diet so it just confirmed the health benefits for her.  I've been concentrating on it a little by myself, and for the past two weeks I've tried to get him to watch it but he continued to argue that he'll never give up meat and that the human body needs meat for protein, especially since he is a weight lifter, and that people who don't eat meat are skinny and scrawny and look sickly.  I said, how can you give an opinion on something when you haven't even watched it!?  Finally today, after taking a nice walk at a park, and being relaxed because he has the week off from work, he agreed to sit down and watch it.  Well after the first 15 minutes I heard him say, ""Hmmm""...I knew he was getting it.  When it was over he said, OK then, lets give it a try!  I think a couple of areas really hit home with him, and he was able to relate very closely to one of the stories.  Somehow after watching it the thought of not eating meat isn't as scary to him anymore..he was so impressed by it he agreed its worth a try, starting out slowly (not giving it up completely..yet).  Tomorrow we are going through the cookbook that I also purchased, and picking out some recipes to make together.

4555914,5,B0053ZHZI2,"My doctor prescribed this to me after I suffered a TIA that left me temporarily unable to speak. I watched the movie, bought the book, The Engine 2 diet, and the Happy Herbivore. After two months my cholesterol dropped from 215 to 92, LDL 50. Over the course of 9 months I lost 50+ lbs, and saw my problems with sleep and concentration go away. I feel years younger.

The most important lesson from this is that I am now in control of my food, not at the mercy of it.

Making the recommended changes is not hard, but it will take some effort. I was a cheese-aholic. After about 2 weeks of no dairy, meat or oil, my cravings for fatty foods went away.

- Learn to read labels: I put more food back on the shelf than in my basket.
- Learn to cook: Between the books, there are lots of recipes. I'm getting better at not burning things.
- Experiment with new foods: I never knew what kale and quina was, now they a central part of my diet.
- Realize that menus are just ingredient lists: Don't be afraid to ask for what you want when eating out.
- I record my weight, blood pressure and heart rate every morning: This keeps me focused. Accept that you'll hit plateaus in weight loss. Watch the trend.
- Don't worry about what others say about your food choices: Some people will be hostile. Ignore them, even if they are family.
- Don't worry about portion size: Eat until you are full. Salads, grains, and legumes can be very filling.

All and all, this movie is a great jumping off point for learning how to eat healthy. I highly recommend it.

We have lost as a family or four 100 pounds. We feel great we have clarity in our minds. The kids are even doing much better.

4555922,2,B0053ZHZI2,"Forks Over Knives, I suspect, will strike viewers in a polarizing way.  Meaning, Vegans and vegetarians will probably see this movie as touting gospel, while Southern-style Beef lovers, will see it as complete garbage.

For me, I found the movie one-sided...It provided evidence that it wanted to share, in order to prove its point, while leaving out critical information and unanswered questions.  For example:

PALEO MOVEMENT:  Many folks from the paleo movement, would point out, that approximately 2 million years ago, human beings began walking upright, and lived, almost entirely on eating the beasts that they killed.  They were hunters/gatherers, and lived this way, largely free of cancer, heart disease, and modern day degenerative conditions (known through anthropological records), up until about 10,000 years ago, at which point, man discovered agriculture, began growing its own food, relying on grains, and from that point forward, we then begin to see anthropological records showing modern degenerative diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and through the industrial revolution, and on in to modern day, this has only gotten worse.  In other words, our ancestors ate meat, and they were significantly healthier than we are.  I don't think Dr. Campbells' research or conclusions ties its conclusions to anthropology in any way.  In fact, the film completely ignores the issue entirely.

PROTEIN:  If I am understanding Dr. Campbells' solution, he is saying, completely disregard the need for protein beyond a vegan diet...Don't worry about it, just eat veggies and fruit, because protein is plenty in  whole foods and plant-based foods, right?  Well, I'm going out on a limb here, but I think that means about 10% to 12% of this diet, is protein.  The rest, is basically complex carbs.  12%?  That is incredibly low.  That means, if an average diet is around 2000 calories (and that's being generous on a plant based diet), only about 200 calories would be protein.  one gram of protein is 4 calories, so, we all, equally (atheletes and couch-potatoes alike), can live a vibrant life, on only 40 grams of protein.  So, all our amino acids, all our building blocks, for all our muscles, no matter what condition, no matter what activity level, can be had from 40 grams of protein.  Did you see any studies rendering this conclusion, in the documentary?  Nothing beyond opinions from a handful of PH.D.'s, who happen to be vegans themselves.  I find this a very hard pill to swallow, and in fact, somewhat dangerous.  See, I heard what the film said, that protein is a big scam, but, what I did not hear, was evidence supporting that conclusion.

NUTRITION:  What about Omega-3s and FISH?  The film completely disregarded the volumes of modern scientific evidence, including population studies, demonstrating that enormous health benefits of cold water fish, and the fatty acids contained in said fish, such as Salmon and Tuna, can have enormous benefits to us human beings.

Furthermore, I'm a little disturbed by the physical make-up of many of these folks in this film, claiming to have the perfect diet.  Aside from the champion MMA guy, did you see anyone in this film, that had a healthy physique, with lots of healthy muscle, good bone structure, and just glow of overall health?  I didn't.  I saw some folks just coming down from high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and some elderly folks who, frankly, are happy to be alive, and I'm happy for them, but come no where close to setting the kind of examples that folks like Jack LaLane set.  I'm not being cruel here...I'm sure they are healthier now, then they were before, but the film sets them up as having these vibrant, active lives, and I don't see it.  I've seen healthier folks, healthier seniors, many of whom do not subscribe to an all vegan diet in order to thrive.

SCIENCE:  We run into a problem, when we have a doctor, that examines a few studies, and forms a conclusion, and then that conclusion becomes said doctors dogma moving forward.  Even though Dr. Campbell is bucking the system, anti-establishment, not following everyone elses' dogma, doesn't mean he is not suffering from his own.  Sorry, but where are the double-blind studies, over a period of 10-20 years, demonstrating, that a vegan diet, is the best diet?  They may be out there, but this film, really only shows one small study, Dr. Campbells own study, of 18 patients, and that's it.  Well, that is not enough.  There have been other doctors like this in the past:  Dr. Atkins, and Dr. Pritikin, both come to mind.  We can take golden nuggets from the research of these kinds of men, but should not make it a foregone conclusion that their dogma, is any better, than anybody elses.

VARIABLES:  I don't have a problem with the chinese population study, or even the clinical studies, or even the Norway study.  Information is information.  But, what I do have a problem with, is the fact that there are so many variables, how can Dr. Campbell come to the foregone conclusion, that these studies all relate to meat?  What about the viability of the studies themselves?  Norway, for example...How do we know that the lack of disease, could have simply been a lack of adequate documentation, in a time of turmoil, during world war II?  How reliable was that study, in other words?  What about the China study...How do we know that other variables, besides meat, was at play there, such as environmental, pollutants, toxins, and/or, the same issue as the Norway study...People are simply interviewing other people, with armchair training, from China in 1970's, no less, and we should conclude that it is absolutely viable data?

So, in conclusion, I think this film did a good job selling a point of view, but in the end, it only provides one side of data, and is therefore, nothing more than a parlor trick.

And by the way, I don't eat meat or chicken, and I don't eat any processed sugar or processed foods.  My diet is largely vegetarian, but I do eat eggs, yogurt, and fish.  I'm just sharing this, in hopes that this review will hold a little more weight.

It's easy to do when you're veganizing comfort foods or simply replacing meat and dairy with vegan analogs in the American standard diet. What a great reminder to get back to the basics - fresh cooked grains and beans, and mountains of veggies and fruits.

4555941,2,B0053ZHZI2,"As I a cardiologist, I believe there is value in a vegan diet, but it is not for everyone. I do think there is scientific evidence, mostly from Dean Ornish, MD, that  strict adherence to this with almost no fat can reverse coronary artery disease, or hardening of the arteries. However the scientific evidence presented in this movie is limited at best and at worst defies common sense and logic. If consuming moderate to high amounts of dairy protein caused liver cancer, as the movie maintains, then this form of malignancy would be more common than lung, breast, and prostate cancer combined world wide. Furthermore the Maasi Indians in Kenya eat a diet rich in meat and dairy and have almost no heart disease.
However, by far the worst omission of this film is to toss fish into the same purported deleterious effects of meat proteins. This is so far from the truth as to be almost laughable. Study after study affirms the benefits of fish in a well rounded diet world-wide. In fact in Japan, which has one of the highest per capita fish consumptions in the world, coronary artery disease is unusual.

Finally, little practical advice is given to a Vegan should they travel, dine out, or eat at a friends' home.

Again, I am all for less processed foods, fats, salt and sugar in our diets. But this movie is  more of a vegan zealot expose than an intelligent discourse on a very important subject.",1347580800,18,1401,4.637096774193548
4555942,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This movie was a catalyst for change in my life and my husbands life. If you are open to change, it can make your life better too:

Life Before October 2011 (Before watching FOK):

My husband and I ate a ""healthy"" diet by American Standards.  The typical day included cereal with milk and orange juice for breakfast, deli meat and cheese on wheat bread for lunch, and chicken or fish for dinner with veggies and a glass of milk for dinner. This was the way we were raised and we were carrying on these food traditions. In addition, we have a very active dog that demands a long brisk walk twice a day, so exercise was not foreign to us either. Despite this seemingly healthy lifestyle that would be considered by some as striking a balance, disease was rampant in both of our families. I (27 years old) was suffering from chronic GI upset, acne, and was overweight.  My husband (28 years old) was also overweight and had high blood pressure.

After watching the movie and some discussion, my husband and I committed to following the principles of Dr. Esselstyn's ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"" for 2 months. It was hard at first. We suffered from withdrawal symptoms in the first week. After that, things started to get easier and we were excited by the positive changes we were seeing in ourselves and each other. The 2 months came and went and we never discussed discontinuing our new lifestyle. The changes were so profound, the subject of discontinuing did not merit the time or the effort.

Life Today September 2012 (1 year after watching FOK):

My husband has lost 30 lbs and has normal blood pressure. He is more energetic and still has energy when he comes home from a long day at work.  He is more active because he is feeling better.  I have lost 25 lbs, have not had GI upset since switching to a Whole Foods Plant Based diet, and my skin is completely clear. In addition, I had a complete blood work-up two months ago because we are planning to start a family soon. My doctor says all of my numbers are perfect (including cholesterol well under 150). The positive consequences of the change in our lifestyle prompted my parents at 58 years of age to make the change as well. We live without fear now, empowered that by our diet choices we can increase our chances of avoiding serious disease that inflicted our grand-parents, aunts, uncles and parents.

If you want to make the change, learning to cook differently can be a challenge.  I would recommend the recipes in the Engine 2 book, the Happy Herbivore series, and the many great healthy food blogs out there (my favorite is ohsheglows.com--be sure to adapt the recipes to get rid of the oil though!). Support can also be found on the discussion forum on the McDougall website.",1347580800,4,2750,4.591836734693878

We as a nation simply cannot continue to afford to pay for all the medicines, procedures, and surgeries that are necessary to keep people alive who continue to eat an animal based diet. If we were, as a nation, to switch to a plant based diet our medical costs would be halved or even less. Eating animal based foods is just as bad or worse on one's health as smoking two or three packs of cigarettes a day.

4555961,5,B0053ZHZI2,"After watching this documentary a year ago, I thought I'd have a go at giving up meat and dairy. I work at a school and we are always having people in our district or their family members on a prayer list each week for heart disease, stroke, and mostly cancer. I watched this on Netflix after making the comment to someone offhandedly that I figured I'd end up with diabetes withing 10 years. Ridiculous! I thought I would see if I had enough will power to do it for just a week. The only meat I missed was a hamburger, which was crazy because I was very near carnivorous at the time. But I decided to press on for one more week and then 6 pounds dropped...so I had to keep going to see how much I would lose, right? A year later, I've lost 50 pounds, have energy (I actually want to exercise - crazy!), and am ready to see what else I can give up - I'm thinking caffeine and sugar.
Whenever I need motivation, I watch this documentary again. It's information you can't ignore. I'm sure some people will comment that the information is wrong or something, just because no one wants to hear the foundation of our diet is what's killing us. However, the information is not another pill or radical surgery or giving your money to someone's cause. It's to make healthy food choices.
If you watch it and get inspired (which you will) but you are worried about things like protein, calcium, B12... I know I'm only one person, but I have been without meat or dairy for a year and got my yearly check up blood results today. I made sure to ask for B12, protein, and anything else that vegans are supposed to ""worry"" about.
My protein was 7.2! My meat-eating buddy fished out his results to compare and he was a 7.4.  So, I don't worry about protein.
Calcium was 9.5.  By the way, the information in this documentary about calcium will make your jaw drop!
B12 was 382. (I probably will eventually take a supplement for this).

I have been trying (and failing) at being vegetarian most of my life. I have never really liked meat but I have also been trained to be addicted to it. This documentary was my tipping point. I have been 3 months now, since watching Forks Over Knives, without meat in my life.

4555975,3,B0053ZHZI2,"I saw this documentary tonight, and the scientific parts were very interesting, although as another review pointed out, some of the ""supposed facts"" (like nations that do not drink milk have lower osteoporosis) are disputable (as said nations have very low lifespan and a lard-labor lifestyle, both of which are negatively correlated with osteoporosis.)

My main complaint is that the last 20 mins of the movie set of alarm bells in my head, and in my wife's head, ""This is an infomercial for SOMETHING, WHAT THING?""  After these red flags, I will be very careful about jumping into a diet of this type.  BUT WHAT TYPE??

Another major flaw in the movie is that it's hinted in several places that the diet they are *selling* is not a vegan or standard vegetarian diet, but something else.  Well, either this is an infomercial (and you should send $10.95 in a self-addressed stamped envelope for their book and all of life's secrets will be revealed!), or this is a documentary (and the answers will be revealed at the end of the documentary.  Since there were no answers at the end, about the difference between their recommendations and a standard vegan/vegetarian diet, I must sadly conclude that this was an infomercial.

Incidentally, I am 50 years old, I get about 10-20% of my calories from meat, and my cholesterol stats are similar to those of the documentary narrator (after the narrator followed this diet), so the results were not terribly impressive.  I drink a TON of nonfat milk and have done so all my life, and have pursued various diets such as Joel Fuhrman's fasting method and weight watchers, and do cardio 3 times a week.

Doctor-supported is a slippery slope as I only remember one practice in the show, and I know healthcare providers who disagree completely.  Also, there are many anecdotal proofs of how inaccurate the whole ""plant-based"" assumption is.  There are many societies, both modern and aboriginal that have virtually no health issues but get most of their calories from animal-based sources.  Inuit people consume about 4 times the animal fat of even the most glutinous American, yet heart disease is almost zero.  Okinawans have a life expectancy far greater than western counterparts, but have animal-based foods in their diets (though admittedly far less than westerners).

As for this documentary I think it was well done as I love the whole before/after thing. As in before switching to a plant based diet many of these people were encroaching on deaths door.

Duh!

As I continued to watch the documentary it seemed that the information presented was incomplete. I think a good documentary challenges how we understand our world. This documentary did not do that, nor did it mention studies of groups of people from different parts of the world who have diet mostly based on animal fat that have no traces of CAD; due to their genetics.

4556068,3,B0053ZHZI2,"I really enjoyed this movie and I agree with a lot of it - but I had several problems.

First off, and Dr. Campbell will be the first to say this, the China Study is not definitive (he says so in the prologue) and it is not peer-reviewed research!

Secondly, I would like to see that graphic about 500 calories of oil not making you feel full. I have never seen hunger associated with how densely your stomach is packed, and our understanding of insulin response seems to go in the opposite direction of what the movie says.

What I do agree with - we need to move to a whole foods plant based diet (though I don't think we need to exclude animal products) and the USDA's recommendations are largely bunk.

The testimonials in the movie are great, but pretty much identical to other movies/books/websites in which people move to a whole foods diet that still includes animal products.

Another major problem was this - One of Dr. Esselstyn's patients said she went from eating all the ""chocolate and donuts"" she could and then went to a whole foods diet - no duh! None of his patients were eating pastured butter and pastured eggs and plenty of vegetables at the outset. I'm certain these people would be just as healthy.

So basically this movie is worth watching, but a McDonald's burger is not the same as a grass-fed beef burger. I also can't fully endorse any movie that gives a universal blessing to ""whole grains"" when a number of scientists are touting the positive effects of eliminating gluten from the diet. (See Novak Djokovic).

Another reviewer noted that different things work for different people, I totally agree with that. The term ""whole foods"" applies both to plant and animal products and the movie totally ignores that not all animal products are created equal - the same way that corn syrup and trans-fat are plant products but not ""whole foods"".

So, worth watching but not definitive by any means.",1342051200,15,1922,4.648967551622419

Many of the key statistics used in the first 20-30 minutes appear to be based on the incorrect assumption that correlation equals causation.  This is NOT to say that the claims are false, but most of these ""shocking numbers"" could be misleading depending on sample size, poor control groups, etc.

For example, the statistics regarding prostate cancer deaths being much lower in Japan than the US may be misleading.  The claim that this is due to diet could be true, but the wide gap in the numbers could also be explained by other factors - i.e. differences in detection procedures, effects of other diseases/illnesses that may mask/superceded prostate cancer, etc.  Similarly, the impact of Nazis taking away livestock may be misleading.  The death rate per 100k would be skewed lower if a much higher number of people were dying from other causes (WWII).

Count me among the believers since, practically immediately after viewing this film, I changed my diet and, within 72 hours, felt not only more energetic and clear-headed (at my age - 58 - a big plus) but - Warning: revealing candor alert - the symptoms of my 3-year battle with urinary incontinence were DRAMATICALLY improved.  It's been 2 months and the dietary adjustments I made after watching ""Forks Over Knives"" have proven to be beneficial in other ways.

My fear was that the film might include footage of animal cruelty and mis-treatment during the farming and slaughtering process much like that of ""Meat, Inc.""; but this film approaches the global health benefit from a wellness perspective and leaves much of the humane issues of our food ""culture"" for others to cover.

4556088,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Watched the DVD back in mid-March.  Decided we'd make the leap, and give it a try.  Purchased the E2 cookbook because I figured if a bunch of fire fighters were eating this stuff, it was probably pretty good.  Excellent book, great recipies, and really helped us start learning a new way of life.  Also purchased 2 other Vegan cookbooks to give ourselves other points of view, and more recipies.

We're still not convinced that 100% meat free is good, or what we really want, so we still eat some type of meat once, or maybe twice a week.  We're not having red meat, not that we'd say ""no"" to it, we just haven't.  Trying to eat only hormone/antibiotic/corn fed free poultry, and occasionally some type of wild caught fish.  Once in a while, local free range eggs.

There's a discussion about B-12 that I think is important to look into.  I certainly don't pretend to understand all the complexities of the issue, but it seems important enough, that for now, we'll continue to eat meat once in a while.

We did completely stop all dairy.  No milk, cheese, or butter.  Tried a bunch of the different non-milk, milks, like Almond Milk, Rice Milk, etc.  Found we like the Flax Milk the best, and it's only 25 calories for the unsweetened version.  Has as much calcium as a glass of milk.

We're seeing a very slight and slow drop in weight.  We already ate very healthy (by ""normal"" standards) so the ""Forks...."" plan isn't really a huge dramatic step.

We're also paying attention to the Paleo Diet, and the idea that grains, including wheat, are similarly bad, just like corn.  Since cutting back on the amount of wheat and brown rice we eat on the ""Forks......"" plan, we've noticed more progression in losing weight.  The term ""Wheat Belly"" is real.

One huge benefit I've seen is that my severe seasonal allergies to pollens are completely gone.  I've suffered with allergies for something like 38 years, and even took the shots when I was a kid.  When I lived in northern coastal CA, the allergies were year round.  After moving to coastal SoCal, they were only present in the last week of April, and through the entire month of May, and sometimes the first week of June.  We have some crazy tree and grass pollens here during that 6 week period, and there are times when our skies look like there's heavy air pollution, and our cars look like we live on dirt roads.  This equates to 6 weeks of pure hell for me.  No sleep, living on bendryl because nothing else will touch it, and having a HEPA filter running full throttle in the living room the entire time. Heck, sometimes I'll put on a paint spraying resperator, just to get some relief for a few hours at home.  Well, allergie season hit this year and was one of the worst on record......or so they tell me!  I had a total of 4 sudafed allergy pills back in the last week of April and first week of May, and that was it.  While everyone was just dying around me, I barely had an itchy nose, if that.  The HEPA filter never came down from the Attic, I didn't miss a night of sleep, and as May became June, I lost all symptoms.  I can even jump on a lawn tractor and go mow deep weeds, driving around in a cloud of dust and pollen, and nothing, not one symptom.  Not even itchy eyes!!

It had to be the dairy, because other than taking spirulina pills, it's the only thing that I've changed 100% since watching ""Forks....."" back in March.

If I get no other benefit from the plan, other than getting 6 weeks of my life back each year, that'll be satisfaction enough.

Oh, one other benefit that I've forgotten about.  For about the last 3 years I've had a dry, peeling area on my nose, and on my forehead just between my eyebrows.  The area on my forehead was slowly spreading, and was usually pink/red enough that people would ask what I'd done to myself.

And what these ""doctors"" said about amino acids is all wrong.  With meat you get all the amino acids...getting them from fruits and grains requires a lot of planning and balance because they only have subsets of the 20 needed acids.

I questioned the causality in their data...such as in the Norway data...they explained the decrease in heart disease from 1940 to 45 because they had their meat taken away, but then why did it rise from 1927 to 1939 in the first place?

4556097,5,B0053ZHZI2,"4 years ago at age of 38, after close to 10 years of work at desk, I ballooned from 150LB to 195LB. I was about 6 Feet. My LDL is above normal and my liver index (AST,ALT) is off the chart high indicating my liver is overworked digesting all the junks I am shoveling over my throat. -:)

After seeing the movie Food Inc, I decided to make major changes in my life style

(1)daily exercise (2)switch to organic meat/dairy product

I still was consumeing a lot of dairy (Yogurt, Milk, Eggs) believing that I need protein for my work-out.

I did lose a lot of weight and built up quiet some muscle. My weight dropped to 160LB and body fat around 10%. But for some reason, my LDL though back to normal range, still pretty high just below the high end and my liver fat index is still above normal. I just kind of accept it thinking maybe it is just in my genes and I already are much healthier than 4 years ago so what is the worry.

Then watching ""FORKS OVER KNIVES"" (I have free streaming due to Prime Membership) totally blew me away. In my opinion, Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr shall one day get Nobel Prize for what they did! As Rip Esselstyn said in the movie, the truth is so simple and it is just criminal not to let the public know.

Even  though I consider myself very healthy/fit, three weeks into the diet recommended in the movie (I still eat some fish and use Olive Oil though but I totally get rid of meat/dairy/shell fish in my diet, also no processed food including the normal culprits - pasta, juice, soda, desert... anything so called empty calories doing nothing but spiking up the blood sugar level), I noticed the following

(1)no more allergy symptom
(2)no stomach bloating (with 8 hour desk job)
(3)more stamina, fast recovery for my work-out
(4)my already high energy level is kicked up to another higher notch
(5)improved eyesight
(6)more peaceful mind, better anger control
(7)need less sleep, maybe because my body now spends less energy without working on these dairy product
(8)my mind is more focused and sharper. Yes, I feel smarter! This extra mental edge by doing vegan is a pretty good surprise for me!

I am off any vitamin supplement, sinus or allergy medicine now. Actually I do not take medicine of any kind right now.

With this eating plan (sorry, I hate to use the word - diet implying portion control), the concept of portion control is out of window for me. It appears that more I eat, more energy level I have.

Yes, I do drink enough organic soymilk every day to get well over 100% daily value of B12 to be on the safe side.

I think it will be only get better since my body is still in the detox process because of my previous consumption of all these animal-based protein products.

My 5 year old son used to drink a lot of  cow milk. I used to think it is good for his bones and growth since we buy expensive organic/skim milk for him. After watching the movie, we switched him completely to soy milk. Before that change, he used to have terrible unexplainable fits of cough especially at night. It was just painful to watch. The pediatrician never asked about his dairy intake even once during his regular checkups. What a surprise! -:)

Now only two weeks later, I can't even remember he has such cough ONCE! He slept much better at night......

I will have my blood test done in 2 months and I am pretty sure my LDL and Liver Fat index will take a major hit this time. It is just that simple - if you eliminate cholesterol in the stuff you put in the mouth, then why on earth you need to take cholesterol medication???

Ask yourself a question if you still insist that eating meat is important: Is it really for the protein or the pleasure of eating? If former, than get off meat immediately. Kale is the NEW beef! -:)  If latter, than do some research on the health impact on your life and decide if you need to change......

Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

---Update 8/12/12---

2.5 months into the diet change, I noticed more postive changes.

I do weights and running daily and often I have pain and discomfort in different running / moving parts - knee, calf, shoulder and I have one particular persistent issue with my left calf for more than 4 months. It did not really bother me but still annoying at flare-up time. Now it is completely gone. I have to give some credit to the anti-inflammation benefit for plant foods - sunflower seeds, garlic, strawberry.....

Also, I used to have trouble completing rotating my left shoulder. It is mostly all back to normal now.

I am turning 42 next week and I am 100% sure my physical condition right now is better than when I am 21!

As the movie said, if you have eaten yourselves into your current health problems, you can also eat your way out of it without side effects of drugs / medical procedure!

(2)No allergy, no sinus issue,
(3)Energy-level sometime so high it is scary
(4)Mind still telling me I need to eat meat but after first bite I just can't eat more meat stuff
(5)Exercisewise, I feel like I can keep running for ever. Planning to try 10K if I get time, For short sprint for quick energy-level boost I can run 1 plus mile at above 9MPH without issue!

4556107,2,B0053ZHZI2,"I'm not going to talk much at all (if at all) about the information presented in the movie and whether it's valid or not. Hundreds of people have already done so in other reviews and comments on Amazon alone. I'm going to talk about how it was presented. And I have three main problems with the presentation:

1) Far too short. I've read ""The China Study"", and it's like reading a college textbook. It even has a huge reference section at the end. It seemed to me like what the people behind this movie were trying to do was to combine all of that with information from other sources (mainly Dr. Esselstyn; I think I spelled that right?) and some experiences and statements from other nutritionists and people trying the way of eating advocated in the movie. One and a half hours isn't even close to enough to cover all of that. It really could have been (and really should have been) much, much longer. It is a documentary after all. Even something like 5 hours would fall far short of the amount of time needed to properly cover all of that. In the movie, it's stated (by Dr. Campbell, I believe) that he wants to provide all this information for the good of the public. So, make a thorough documentary then! You could say that the movie is meant to be an introduction of sorts to the book and other information, but this runs counter to Dr. Campbell's statement. The information presented lacks thoroughness and completeness.

2) Incomplete personal stories. I'm always skeptical when personal stories are presented as evidence. How do you know if they're being honest? If you believe they're being honest, do you have the whole picture? Seeing as personal testimony wasn't the only method used to convey information in this movie, and seeing as I get a sense from Dr. Campbell's book, this movie, and a bit of what I've read between him and Denise Minger that he has scientific integrity, I was able to more easily step back from my initial skepticism. But the big problem is still there: not enough information. What were these people's diets like before? What were their lifestyles like before? We don't know, other than a brief mention at the beginning of the movie by the narrator about the soda and energy drinks he had on the way to his meeting with the nutritionist.

3) Possibly nothing new. I say ""possibly"" because, if you've already read ""The China Study"", this doesn't present anything new. Seeing as that's the main reason I bought the DVD, I was very disappointed. And they could have done it. A big hole in the research is that it doesn't compare enough different lifestyles and diets. For example, you could compare various types of diets that are considered to be healthy or unhealthy for different reasons, only within the U.S., only outside the U.S. within a single country or between multiple outside countries, between the U.S. and a single outside country or multiple ones, etc. And that, in and of itself, could offer a vast wealth of information. I'm sure they couldn't have done all of that, but I think they could have done some. I would be very interested to see that done (preferably documented in a follow-up book). I was going to say I'd also like to see more longitudinal studies, but then I realized that I don't recall what research methods were used how often.

You may have noticed that I called the movie a movie more often than a documentary. And therein lies the problem. For this kind of thing, where you're presenting huge amounts of information in what is essentially intended to be a visual textbook, you NEED a documentary. This tries to be one, but fails miserably. So, if you haven't already, please heed my review title and go read ""The China Study"".

4556112,2,B0053ZHZI2,"This documentary is filled with junk science and statistical trickery. When it is at its best, this documentary shows a mere correlation between the consumption of animal food products and health problems (forget evidence of actual causal links; the film doesn't draw any distinction between correlation and causation). But a lot of the time, it doesn't even show an actually factual correlation.

For example, the film claims, without any evidence, that the ""scarcity of animal foods"" is the reason that heart disease drops in German occupied Norway in the '40s; they have no actual numbers on animal product consumption to draw a correlation, its just a guess. They don't even suggest the possibility that a war might have effected the rate at which heart disease was reported. They may as well have claimed that ""physical proximity to Nazis reduces instances of heart disease"", as that is no less supported by the evidence that they present.

Likewise, the film relies heavily on anecdotes. We hear about people who are healthy because they've ""changed their health destiny"" (as one anecdote describes it). Even when most of the anecdotes clearly involve exercise and a generally improved diet, the improvement is always treated as being a result of ""low-fat plant based foods"" exclusively.

And as mentioned before, the film doesn't care about causation. The documentarian accepts practically magical assessments of how diseases are caused. We are presented with the (unsubstantiated) claim that cancer is a ""switch"" that is caused by the percentage of protein we ingest; there is no discussion of how this ""switch"" actually operates, just that there is a correlation, and that correlation is adequate to conclude thusly. The film ignores that the general cause of cancer is pretty well understood, insofar as how it is a result of damaged DNA. But their ignorance of any mechanism that could actually cause cancer is treated like a STRENGTH; the film is leading us to believe that it is a STRENGTH for their position that they don't know how animal protein causes cancer.

The fact that this documentary has such a high rating demonstrates how poorly educated we all are about science. The documentary draws conclusions from a mere handful of studies, many from decades ago, and even uses them and a couple of anecdotes to demonize real science and medicine. The film is a veiled attack on modern medicine, as hints are dropped left and right about how bad modern medicine is, and how diseases can be ""reversed"" if you just eat differently. The documentarian repeats that the number of doctors who espouse their theories about health is ""small, but growing."" The important point is that converts in medicine to an exclusive diet of ""plant based foods"" is small.

That said, they don't get everything wrong, but the things they get right about super-stimulants like fast food are so polluted by their junk science, I can't recommend anything other than skipping this film. Just eat better and exercise more. Yes, fatty foods and a diet with a ton of meat is bad, but that doesn't mean any amount of meat will kill you, or that a whole foods plant based diet will cure you of all your ills.",1338508800,18,3193,4.960747663551402
4556113,1,B0053ZHZI2,"I watched the movie recently as it was highly recommended by a friend and came highly reviewed. It goes to show however that just because somebody writes an editorial or a review, it doesn't mean they are able to scrutinized the information presented. This movie is full of unscientific bias and needless to say I wasn't impressed. It's littered with misinformation, unsubstantiated claims and conclusions. If you decide to watch the movie or already have, I would like you to consider the following:

The movie immediately started out demonizing animal products without any facts, erroneously linking dietary cholesterol to atherosclerosis. It has been proven that it's caused by chronic inflammation (and calcium). This leads to the question of what causes the chronic inflammation, blood cholesterol certainly has nothing to do with it.

Processed food kept getting lumped together with animal foods and what does casein have to do with meat, it's a protein found in milk? Furthermore sausage is not meat, it's a processed food and there are many different grades of quality available.

How does organic raw dairy food (live food) compare to pasteurized dairy food (dead food) from sick cows. How does a McDonald's hamburger compare to organic grass fed beef? No distinctions were made.

The before diet of an individual was never revealed, only the new diet. If someone ate Donuts and McDonald's before and then switched to quality home cooked vegetables ...... of course they will feel better, but what does that have to do with eliminating quality animal products.

How does starting to exercise while at the same time an individual stops eating meat, implicate the lack of meat for feeling better? That's biased and purely just nonsense.

I noted that most anybody slim was really just skinny fat, no muscle at all, which is no surprise to me. In order to build quality muscle, mostly quality fat and some complete protein sources are required. Consider that steroid hormones are made from cholesterol.

There are a lot of conclusions with little detail of the research ...... correlation isn't necessarily causation.

Also watched The Engine 2 Diet video and next on my reading list is Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease. The more I read, the more I am driven to share this information with others. Going from vegetarian to a nutrient-dense, whole foods, plant-based diet was easy. When I think I might stray, I think about increasing my risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. I want to be healthy and watching this movie was the catalyst.

I had heard about this film quite some time ago, but never bothered to spend the $4 to watch it. I've seen so many documentaries on food (many of which I've enjoyed) that I felt like I had ""seen it all"" when it came to commentaries about the Standard American Diet and eating a whole foods plant based diet. I didn't feel like being ""preached at"" on the topic and consider myself knowledgable about nutrition already.

So I was completely surprised to find this film so remarkable. It is truly well done. By that, I mean everything from how it's been produced (the graphics, the voiceovers, the editing- all best in class & very engaging) to how the story is told. It is the most scientifically-based documentary I've seen on the topic of food and health, but more than that- it is inspiring and powerful to learn from these two pioneers of science (both in their 70's and accomplished physicians, researchers, & human beings- they absolutely live what they're talking about).

There is valuable information about the benefits of a plant-based diet filled with whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables, and about the dangers of relying too much on meat, dairy products and processed foods that contain large amounts of various sugars, but in the end they become unnecessarily polemical. I read this as part of a journey toward healthier eating that led me to shed 75 pounds, lower cholesterol, and improve overall blood chemistry, but while finding it interesting and informative, was a bit turned off by the stridency of the argument for veganism.

Do not listen to the loud voices you heard via the media about how great meat and dairy are. Don't fall for the fast food ads. They are all from industries out to make money and that is all. Sadly, God's ""Do unto others...."" doctrine is ignored because many in these industries would choose to even poison their own family members if it meant making money. Do you all remember when years ago - was it a couple of decades ago? that it was found that a company was selling tainted baby food! Raw fruits and veggies contain living enzymes REQUIRED by us to live! Read The Enzyme Factor. Dr. Shinya does think some meat is okay, and I am not sure about that, but he explains enzymes well from a scientific point of view. If you need guidance in how to go about going vegan, check out Hallelujah Acres and Rev. Malkmus in Shelby, NC. He cured himself of cancer in 1976 by going vegan and juicing and has helped thousands around the world, including many doctors, nurses and ministers.

4556141,5,B0053ZHZI2,"FORKS OVER KNIVES is a fascinating examination of how diet affects our health. We ARE literally what we eat. The food we eat gets converted into our cells. It just doesn't enter our cells, ultimately, in the process of cell replacement, it becomes the fabric of our bodies.

I have read the less laudatory reviews, and I've come away with the impression that some people, with a very human ""all or nothing"" mentality, take extreme umbrage at this film and it's science, which has in fact been proven.

I'm not sure exactly what they are advocating. I find it hard to believe that anyone in their right mind believes that we should subsist on a constant diet of coffee, candy bars, dollar menu hamburgers, drivethrough-window doughnuts, soda, french fries, pizza, cookies, and wilted lettuce. Sounds bad, doesn't it? Take a good close look at what many Americans eat, and you'll be horrified.

The fact that 30% of Americans are obese is the tell. The fact is that much of the food we buy is genetically engineered, loaded with hormones, and shot through with chemicals in processing, including toxins like ammonia. It's simply not healthy food. Aspartame, found in most diet sodas, contains phenylalanine, an amino acid the overpresence of which causes brain damage and mental retardation. Autism rates have skyrocketed. Cancer is too common. It makes sense to look at what we eat. Over time it is causing us great harm.

Japan, whose citizens, before fast food, maintained a healthy and balanced diet of vegetables, carbs (mostly rice), legumes, and some meat, had far lower cancer and other disease rates than their American contemporaries.

They were not pure vegans (neither are the Chinese, Indians, Tibetans, Thais, and others). They ate SOME meat. A Mr. Yen who appears in the film made the point that the amount of meat one American eats at one meal could traditionally feed an entire Chinese family. Likewise, data on casein shows that a reduction in this dairy-based protein lowers cancer rates. It makes sense. Most human adults are naturally allergic to milk products (though we eat them regardless); and the dairy we eat is derived from other animals and is not meant for us to ingest anyway.

The facts shown in the film indicate that a REDUCTION of animal-based proteins reduces cancer risk and the risk of other issues. It certainly can't hurt us to eat in a healthier way. Will some people, like Rip Esselstyn advocate total meatlessness? Sure they will, and bully for them! If it works for them, it works for them. Completely abjuring meat is not for everyone.

It's your choice. This film is meant to educate and enlighten. It's a film about eating a healthier diet, not joining a cult. The film is FORKS OVER KNIVES not FORKS NO KNIVES.",1336521600,2,2756,4.851063829787234

4556150,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Being a doctor I had long heard the cry from the distant corners of my field, those poor lonely souls that live in the shadows because their opinions (despite having very strong science behind them)are chalked up to tree hugging, hippy B.S.

Then I had a revelation.

During an annual physical I was told that I was at an extremely high risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer, diabetes and a variety of cardio diseases. I thought to myself, how is this possible? I am 31 years old, I am in pretty good shape, I am never sick, I feel pretty good (I thought I did, I didn't know any better) and I have a pretty healthy diet (The occasional pizza and hotwings not withstanding)

I received a prescription for 5 different medications to bring down blood pressure, fight off cholesterol and keep me alive. I went to the pharmacy, picked up these pills and brought them home. Setting them on my kitchen counter I stared at them, I knew what they were, I knew patients on them, hell, I had prescribed them to many of those patients... I also knew that they were not a cure, they were barely a stop gap, and I was going to be taking these for the rest of my life... I was not at all okay with this.

So I started doing some research, and then a friend of mine recommended that I watch ""Forks over Knives"". The statements made in this documentary were 100% in line with my own research, and I became a convert. I eliminated all animal products and all processed foods from my diet and made no other changes. 45 days later my blood work is that of an athlete, no warning signs of any kind are visible. I lost thirty pounds (I can see abs again). And I feel better, have more energy and look younger than I did in high school.

After 2 weeks I started prescribing this diet to my patients and many of them accepted it for the chance to get off some of their pills. Those that took the challenge have all reported identical or similar results. I highly recommend not only this product but this lifestyle, it WILL save your life.",1335744000,11,2014,4.3315649867374
4556151,1,B0053ZHZI2,"I'm a biology teacher, so I teach my students what is good science and what is bad science.  This documentary has a lot of bad science, reminiscent of whenever I watch videos that support ""intelligent design"" over evolution.

Here are a several things that bothered me about this documentary:

*The use of ""vegan"" or ""vegetarian"" is barely ever used.  Instead they use ""plant-based diet"" which seems sneaky to me.

*Casein protein is dairy protein, so the rat study in the film doesn't apply to all animal proteins.

*The makers of the film failed to include that the rats on the high protein diet actually lasted longer than the rats on the low protein diet, whose lifespan was cut in half.  Look up ""Denisse Minger Forks Over Knives"" for an in-depth review on this documentary.

*You simply can't compare Americans and their health/diseases to the Chinese, Norwegians, Kenyans, and Filipinos.  Think of the different lifestyles, environment, and the food available to them.  It would be wrong to single out animal protein as the main reason why American's are inflicted with a higher rate of heart disease since there are so many other variables to consider.

*Why not show a study comparing two groups of Americans, both eating a healthy diet with vegetables, but one of the groups has the addition of animal protein?  Instead they compare ""unhealthy American"" to ""vegetarian American"" and then place the blame on meat rather than on their other choices in diet (like fried foods, energy drinks, coffee, chocolate, gravy, etc).

*Correlation doesn't prove causation.  The doctors in the documentary make a lot of observations, but those are only observations, like the one they make in which the well-fed Filipinos on an animal-based diet had cancer.  I can make the same observation that being rich means you get cancer.  But that's only an observation.  What is done after one makes an observation is come up with a hypothesis, perform a controlled study, and then analyze the results.  That's the one thing that's missing in this documentary which are controlled studies.  The only controlled study that I saw was the rats on the casein protein, but even then, the makers of this film seemed to only cherry pick the information from that study to support their point.

*They mention how bad eating meat is for the environment since land for cattle is attained through deforestation, but they leave out how crops use land as well; so in essence, you do not eliminate deforestation whether you're vegetarian or not.

Overall, this documentary is very one-sided.  It felt like, the filmmakers were thinking ""What can I show in this film to make someone go vegetarian?  Let's throw in a couple doctors, some graphs, sciencey terms, report the results of some studies while leaving out the results of others.""

I felt like I was being tricked and I feel sorry for the person who doesn't have a discerning eye and will easily be fooled.",1335571200,98,2936,4.9087221095334685

4556161,5,B0053ZHZI2,"My review is based on how this diet has affected my health.

Twelve weeks ago, I watched this DVD and decided to give the diet a try.  I have now just had my annual physical and these are my results:

My total cholesterol was approximately 200 and is now 132.
My LDL (bad cholesterol) was 111 and is now only 70.
Weight loss: 22 pounds in 12 weeks (diet only, no exercise)

My doctor had never heard of this diet, but he has completely taken me off my blood pressure medicine. I have been taking blood pressure medicine for 16 years, and now I don't need it. I am 6 feet tall and still need to lose 32 pounds to get down to a good weight of 178. 12 weeks ago I was obese and now I am simply overweight. It is amazing how a small adjustment in one's life can make a huge difference in one's health.

If you watch this documentary, pay attention to the case studies that it portrays and then decide whether you want these same results. If you are brave and bold enough to try this, you will find that staying on this diet is not difficult. Early on, I was surprised to find that I have more energy on this plant based diet. I loved rare steaks, bacon, and cheese, but now I do not really miss them. Now I love vegan pizza with shiitake mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and Vidalia onions.(Amy's provides these in the frozen food section of your grocery store.) I love having only one chin. It would be embarrassing to describe how this diet helps me in other parts of my life.

Update:
1 1/2 years later, I am still on a plant based diet and I have lost further weight.  The biggest surprise for me was that after 12 weeks on the diet, it was very easy to stay on it.  When I eat out, I just say that I have to watch my cholesterol and people usually accommodate me. If my wife drags me to a burger place like Red Robin, I get them to make me something with no meat or cheese - then I coax them into loading it up with every type of vegetable and fruit that they have on hand.

Months before going on this diet, my eye doctor alerted me that although my blood pressure medicine may be able to lower my blood pressure, it was not effective in stoping the narrowing of the arteries in my eyes due to cholesterol  build up and that this put me at much higher risk for blindness.  Specifically, he told me that my A/V (artery to vein - retinal arteriole-to-ven-ule diameter) ratio was bad: 1/2. He told me that I needed to lower my cholesterol through diet and exercise.  However, when I went for my next annual eye exam 11 months after converting to a plant based diet, he was pleased to find that my A/V had improved to 2/3 and he was no longer concerned.

The disadvantages of a plant based diet:  the first few weeks on the diet are hard because your body is not used to so much fiber.

Additionally, if you are taking blood pressure medicine, your medicine may become too strong for you and make you light headed in a few weeks.  A doctor  explained to me that this diet causes a double whammy against your cholesterol.  First your blood cholesterol goes down because you are no longer consuming cholesterol. Second, you are eating huge amounts of soluble fiber (found only in plants), and your liver bile (which is 70% cholesterol) binds to the soluble fiber and exits your body along with the fiber.  This forces your liver to frequently manufacture new bile, and to create this bile, it has to rob the cholesterol from your blood.  This is a good thing, and the solution to the light headedness is to visit your doctor, have him/her check your blood pressure, and lower your medication. I realize that this sounds obvious, but the benefits of this diet in terms of reduced cholesterol and reduced blood pressure may begin to occur much faster than you or your doctor anticipate.  I have a friend on this diet who was stage two diabetic, and he had a similar issue in how rapidly his need for insulin declined.",1334448000,21,3907,4.317373461012312

Crispy Cremes, chocolate, cheddar cheese. Never met a carb or fat I didn't like-except beans. Since watching FOK (and re-watching it every other week) I have lost 12 pounds (in 6 weeks) and eat whatever and as much as I want. FOK changed what I want to eat. I'm loving green salads, beans and lentils with brown rice, soy burgers on whole wheat bread for lunch. Fruit, almond milk in my morning coffee. Other foods as well, but all plant based. I have energy, sleep well at night, and am the most positive emotionally in years. I've never been so regular in my life. I may occasionally still eat a little meat (like the chinese do), a smidgeon of goat cheese , or a free range egg here and there. But I no longer purchase them.

This movie is an eye opener to eating habits verses the governments priorities. Sort of sad really.,1333929600,,255,4.688888888888889
4556166,2,B0053ZHZI2,"Let's start with the positive.  The film starts out seemingly focused on health only.  It does a good job of highlighting several studies of the relationship between diets high in animal products (and other processed food) and heart disease and certain types of cancer which are at epidemic levels in the US and other Western nations.  The correlation is made very obvious in this film.  The film gives powerful illustrations of this using health statistics from other countries such as Japan and China and a particularly powerful example from Nazi occupied Norway.

While interesting, this information is by no means surprising or ground breaking.  It is very much in line with lots of other material on the subject and health messaging that is already out there in the public space.  It is also plainly obvious to most of us - eat large quantities of animal fat and processed sugar and your going to have health problems that will eventually kill you unless you change your ways.""  Nothing at all new here - a fact highlighted even in the film by a quote from Hippocrates (very long time ago), ""Let food by thy medicine.""

The film only gets ""ambitious"" and I would say quirky in the last 10 - 15 minutes when it begins to reveal the philosophical framework behind a large part of modern veganism and the propaganda volume gets turned way up.  This seems to be the real motivation of the film.  Moving away from a strict focus on science-based health, we are then told the reason why we are facing such a health epidemic in the US by an evolutionary biologist.  Without offering any evidence for this, he boldly tells us that our health crisis is not at all based on overindulgence and laziness, but on our evolved biological systems which greedy corporations (with government collusion) prey upon in order to trick us into eating lots of junk food.  The film goes on to mention just in passing how this is keeping us from being able to feed the world's poor on cheaply produced grain and of course it is all at expense of ""innocent"" animals.  So now we've made the journey from ""eat less animals and sugar cause it's healthier"" to a full on liberal materialistic worldview based on bad economics and even worse philosophy.  As a Christian, I cannot accept these arguments and I felt a bit led on by this film.  I don't endorse it, but my family and I ARE going to eat more veggies for the next 2 weeks to see if it helps us feel better (the people in the final scene just looked so happy and healthy).",1333756800,4,2504,4.5807174887892375
4556167,5,B0053ZHZI2,"If implemented properly, this way of eating can become life changing for most people. I have always been in decent health and exercise regularly being that I am in the military. I feel that the options for eating this way have helped ensure that I am around to see my grand kids grow up.  After 45 days of this diet i have went from 200 lbs down to 187, my weight after completing boot camp. Also my bp has dropped from in the upper 130's over mid 80's to 122/77. I am currently waiting for my cholesterol results to come back. I notice that my blood sugar does not rise and fall as much now. I also feel full longer after meals. The engine 2 diet book makes this so simple. We are now a new family eating to live, not living to eat. However with all these positive comments said, I am not 100% sold on every aspect of the diet, for example, one is allowed to eat olives but not use olive oil because of the fat content. This does not make sense to me. I have used this diet to modify the items I buy when shopping. I feel that I am making healthier choices than before. I think that everyone could find some positive aspects to apply to their life to help improve their health. I still eat fish on occasion and feel great after I eat it. What it has boiled down to for me is to make healthier choices on a daily basis and if I want to have a burger every now and then it is not going to kill me.",1333584000,4,1396,4.0215827338129495

4556169,4,B0053ZHZI2,"This documentary is a proof that when it comes to any issue, we need to be responsible for our actions. The same goes for food consumption. Obviously the USDA would protect the interest of its donors not the general public or the school lunch program. Obviously Cornel will go against a doctor who is speaking not favorably to a certain industry since Cornel survives by grants. Citizens should not expect their government to tell them to get into sports or have a healthy diet or what a healthy diet is. It is the function of every citizen to care for themselves since staying healthy means being able to move, hike, bike, see places, go places, surf and swim in the ocean instead of being a couch potato... Even the director did not know his own health condition just like millions of people who do not get a blood test but yet dump vitamins and supplements into their body without knowing if they are low in the supplement that they are using or not and that is considering if it is a safe product or supplement at all. Every serious cancer patient knows that they can not consume meat since it requires too much energy and difficult on the body and infact if they happen to be a real serious cancer patient they can not even consume plant base food either since even the fiber is hard on the body and they have to get a juicer so the nutrients would go directly to the blood stream without their body doing the actual work of separating the fiber in the plants that they are consuming. I consume fish and yogurt on a daily basis and stay away from processed foods, eating out, salt, sugar and fat although I get my fat from my organic whole yogurt. Sports should be a joy not a duty and the same goes for ingredients that we consume. I did not learn much from this documentary but regardless, the packaging and the format of this documentary is a good one which hopefully can spread the reality which is pay attention to ingredients that you consume and treat your body like a machine by getting a blood test with all details so you can see what is what...

Director's blood test showing HDL level of 40 (which they did not elaborate at all) is on the borderline if not low after 13 weeks of plant base food. Got to get it above 60 and triglyceride of 169 (which they did not elaborate at all) was high as well. Hopefully he will watch his documentary and do better not only by diet but by being active just like the landscaping contractor. The biggest change was in the landscaping contractor. He looked sick at the beginning and at the end of the documentary he was glowing, in a good shape, with a big smile on his face.

4556172,1,B0053ZHZI2,"Where does one start with a film that is a mish-mash of nonsense, pseuodo-science and common sense? To be fair, ""Forks over Knives"" does show that reducing fat consumption and increasing activity levels helps to attain and keep one's overall health. (I look forward to Mr. Fulkerson's next documentary demonstrating that fire is hot and water is wet).
  But on to the nonsense, quite often in the movie a graph is shown comparing meat consumption with cancer and  heart disease for various nations. But look carefully at which countries are used, in one they compare cancer rates in Kenya and Uganda to the U.S. rate. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending how you look at it), cancer rates go up as a population ages (especially for those over 65). Kenya has a life expectancy of 59, Uganda 53, U.S.A. 78 (data is from indexmundi). Does any one see a problem here? I shouldn't be shocked with the method of comparing apples and oranges, (since the movie does go on about plants and all), but I prefer some honesty in a documentary.
  Lets look at the Norway segment (where meat consumption goes down along with coronary disease in WWII). But they choose not to mention that fish consumption rose by 200% (and there seems to be evidence that the Omega-3 fat in fish leads to better heart health), nor is it mentioned that the average weight of the Norwegian population decreased over this time period (and guess what, reductions in obesity rates are linked to reductions in coronary diseases).

  Later in the zeal to demonize all dairy products (even the non-fat kind), Dr. Campbell states that milk products cause a condition called ""metabolic acidosis"", which draws calcium out of the skeletal system, causing osteoporosis. One problem with this factoid, it is absolutely false. According to researchers at the University of Calgary, dairy products do not produce acid upon metabolism nor produce metabolic acidosis and diet has no influence on systemic pH,(see October 2011 edition of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, PMID 22081694).",1333238400,97,2056,4.991228070175438

4556179,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This movie is a documentary showing how animal meats and by products such as dairy can cause chronic diseases.  And how having a whole food vegetarian diets can reverse chronic diseases and cancer.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who want to live a healthy live, as this movie will motivate you to do so.

And this movie help makes sense of something I observed many years ago.  As many decades ago I knew of a Vietnamese woman who like to go to eat at the Vietnamese Restaurants.  She would leaves her children at home to be taken care of by the house keeper.  The house keeper would cook traditional Vietnamese food that is mostly vegetables with a very small amount of meat added as flavoring.  While the mother would go to the Vietnamese Restaurant and order the Vietnamese noodle soup call Pho, which is full of Beef meat, tendons and other beef parts including the fat that is in the beef broth.  If you ever ate a Vietnamese Pho, try putting a cube of ice in the broth and you can see the fat in the broth solidified into lards around the ice cube.

She later was diagnose with cancer.  She went to the western doctors and they tell her the typical western stuffs.  She then went to an oriental medical doctor and he tells her not to eat meat.  I heard about it through a secondary source and not directly from the doctor so I only got the meats part, but I suspect that he recommend the whole food vegetarian diet portrait in this video.  Of course she listen to the western doctor and ignored the oriental medical doctor advice.  She died two years later after living two torturous years in agony.

And now I see these Vietnamese Pho Restaurants are popping up every where.  And I suspect more people will died a torturous death from being stupid and eat the Pho with all the animal meats, fats, mostly beef products, and other animal parts.

So take little effort and watch this video.  The little time spend watching this video can help change your attitude.  I have read about the hazardous of meats and animal products at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-American-Diet/dp/B002BX1SQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North American Diet</a>&nbsp;but it did not stay with me in my brain.  You just forget about it and go back to your old way.  But this video will really hit you hard about the important of your diet. They say a picture, real picture not Photoshop picture , is worth a thousand words.  Thus what you see in this video will be worth a trillions trillions words.

Comment:  The Pho that you see at these Vietnamese Restaurants are not really Vietnamese Food.  It is created by the Chinese immigrants in Vietnam for the Vietmese.  As it is common for immigrants coming to a new country to open a Restaurants, since they don't have a trade, as normally the trades are carry on by the locals passing down from family.  Thus when the Chinese Immigrants came to Vietnam, they open Restaurants and created Pho.  Who care if it kills these Vietnamese as long as it taste good and get these Vietnamese to folk out the moneys.  As time goes by, the Vietnamese get use to it and the Pho became part of their cuisine culture. Now you know the true history of Vietnamese Pho Noodle Soup.

Update 5/5/5013

There is a Consumer Report magazine article on the December 2012 issue that shows that Rice has a high concentration of Arsenic.  That means that every time you eat at these ethnic restaurants that serve rice & rice products, such as the Vietnamese Pho noodle soup with Rice noodle in it, you are poisoning yourself with Arsenic.  And all those health conscious people who were eating rice cakes & rice waffles, thinking that they are eating healthy, are poisoning themselves with Arsenic also.

But you said that Asians have been eating rice for along time and they had no problem with it.  This video mentioned about the China study that shows that when the Asians stop being a vegetarian and start eating the western diet of meat and other animal products, they start to have all kind of diseases.  Maybe it is not the eating of meat but the Arsenic in the rice that is causing all these diseases.  As they no longer have the protection against Arsenic from a vegetarian diet, since fibers helps to remove heavy metals, or per one study by UC Davis about dietary fiber stated ""they are able to chelate heavy metals"". And phytochemical in vegetable has some protective property.

Therefore this shows that a vegetarian diet is good for you in many other ways, including protection against Arsenic poisoning from your diet.

For more information about Arsenic in your rice, do a search on Youtube or Google for 'arsenic in rice'.  Or you can stop by your local library in the magazine section and look up the December 2012 issue of Consumer Report magazine.  It should still be available on the shelf since it is only 6 months old at this moment in time.

The strengths of this video include the testimonials as well as the science presented in clear layman's terms.  I'm glad I own this DVD because it is definitely one to watch multiple times, and each time I get a little more out of it.  I would strongly recommend the companion book, as well.",1331337600,,552,4.525252525252525
4556194,5,B0053ZHZI2,"First let me state:  I have been vegan well before watching this documentary.  I made the switch to a vegetarian diet after watching Food Inc and then doing some research.  I then had a vegan cleanse program and couldn't believe how much better I felt after cutting out dairy.  I decided to stick with the vegan diet from then on.  I am very active and run 3-4 times per week at least 5 miles per run and practice yoga 3-5 times per week.  I have noticed higher energy since switching my diet.  But here is the advice I have to give: I have two siblings that both went vegan but got very unhealthy and were ill and tired a lot.  They had to switch back to a pescatarian (sp?) diet (vegetarian with seafood basically).  But they had to switch because you can't have a proper vegan diet on just beans, daiya, and french fries...  I take a vegan vitamin every day, and regularly have various greens, fruit, other vegetables, beans, grain (mostly rice) while avoiding wheat when I can, though not to the detriment of my health.

What this documentary shows is that a proper, well rounded, vegan diet can be healthy.  It never really says a diet light on meat and dairy is bad.  It never states that a vegetarian diet with some dairy is unhealthy.  It merely points out some facts from various studies performed around the world and during different time periods.

Of course anyone can find data to back up what they state.  It's why all of these super-diets and diet pills have these ads claiming so.  They have 100 different programs with dozens of participants each and pick out the few groups with the results they like and publish those.

Most of the data in this documentary is from the China Study, which is an interesting book.  It's worth a quick read.  But again, this is information regarding people of one country, race, and lifestyle.  Some of the other facts are interesting, but really don't make a huge case.

The only reason I advocate this documentary is because everything they recommended for people worked for me, even before I saw this.  But I won't say this diet will work for everyone; look at my siblings, they couldn't make it work.  It's all about approaching the switch responsibly.

But more studies show that with a diet high in sugar, dairy, and fats is unhealthy.  There is not one study that shows that fast food is better for you than a wholesome cooked meal.  I think the main lesson from this documentary should be:

Eat less meat.  Eat less fat.  Eat less sugar.  Live longer.

Although I don't really mind if everyone takes this advice.  If we all started eating healthier, we'd be in a situation like Japan.  Too many long lived old folks and not enough young working folks to support their aging elderly.  And the Japanese are the longest lived people of any large country (I think there are a couple of countries less than 2 million people that live longer).  But looking at the Japanese diet:  occasional fast food, mostly rice, soybean, miso, vegetables, and seafood.  Less meat and more vegetables.

So watch the documentary and decide for yourself.  Sure they studies are skewed, but there is no way that eating a plant based diet is not better for your health than a diet with tons of meat and fast food.

But the better documentary by far is :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Food-Inc/dp/B0027BOL4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Food, Inc.</a>

My cholesterol is high, and I'm afraid to have it checked. I feel old and tired, and I'm afraid of all the diseases and health conditions that are surely in my future. I eat canned veggies pretty often, but I am not adventurous at all. So this is going to be a gradual process of trying new things and phasing old things out.

I have now read dozens of testimonials from people just like me, on the web, who've tried this system and have had their lives turned around. I want what they have very badly. The studies are great, and this documentary covers all of my questions and concerns about the science of eating less meat and dairy. Like I said though... It will take a while for me to phase out my finickiness of vegetables. My wife is the same way, so I'm not remotely sure she'll be on board. Worst case scenario? We find a few more veggies we like...

4556199,1,B0053ZHZI2,"I was really excited when I got e-mails regarding this documentary's release last year.  Alas, it wasn't showing at a theater close to me so I had to wait for Netflix.  So last night, I started watching this movie.  At 13 minutes in, the good doctor was talking about cholesterol and they were showing him pulling a string of cholesterol out of someone's coronary artery.  Gross (the cholesterol, not the surgery).  Anyways, the next words out of his mouth were that all animals produce cholesterol (true) and it's important in your cells' walls.  Really?  A doctor says that...in his out-loud voice.  Now, I teach college-level Anatomy & Physiology so I asked my 17 year old junior in high school what was wrong with that.  Without missing a beat, he replies that animal cells don't have cell walls (true); this is scary because he's had one semester of high school biology......two years ago.

Now I'm REALLY paying attention.  The narrator goes on to talk about a trip to India in which he finds an article in an obscure medical journal (they pan to the article).  They describe the experiment in which rats (they pan to a ""researcher"" putting ""rats"" -coincidentally, the size of mice) into a box.  The next thing, he is talking about some rats getting a diet of 20% casein while the other group got a diet of 5% casein.  The former group got cancer while the second group didn't.  Ummm, and the control group?  Well, we don't actually know if there was a control group because it was not mentioned.  (I tried to find the article or author and was not successful although I didn't spend a lot of time on it.)  Incidentally, you know there was a study back in the 1970s that showed saccharine to be carcinogenic, right?  Of course that was all they reported.  It turns out that saccharine is carcinogenic if you drink something silly like 250-300 cans of diet soda every day.....for something silly like 10 years.

Anyways, after 17 minutes of misinformation and bad science I was pretty much done wasting my life.  Are there actually parts of this that are worthwhile?

4556204,3,B0053ZHZI2,"First off: I agree with the topic wholeheartedly.  The majority of Americans have a LOT to learn about eating well and could easily improve their health through diet.

There are some interesting claims and some evidence to investigate in this movie, but it didn't really prove the link between animal consumption and heart disease and cancer.  I'm going to read The China Study to learn more about that.

However, take everything in this movie with a grain of salt - take it in, but let yourself question it.  For example at one point they say that one of the doctors noticed that breast cancer rates in Kenya in 1978 were much (they don't say how much) lower than in the US, which lead him to investigate and think that meat was the reason.  EXCEPT:

1) 66% of breast cancer cases in the US occur in women over the age of 55
2) In 1978 the average lifespan of a woman in Kenya was 56, so it's no surprise that the rate was lower.
3) Kenya is well known for food shortages, and it's a fact that reduced calorie diets reduce the occurrence of cancer.  (It doesn't mean they're fun diets to be on)
4) I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the rate of breast cancer screening was lower in Kenya than in the US.  I've got not evidence, but I'm pretty sure it's right.

That's just one example of a 30 second part of the movie that can easily be picked apart with ease.  I'm not saying that there isn't anything good about this movie, but don't just accept it all as fact.",1330300800,42,1472,4.258992805755396

4556207,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Given the enormous political agenda of so many books and documentaries about diet, I approached this with some hesitation. There are many bold claims made throughout together with some personal stories that border on miracles. The basic proposition is that by eliminating animal-based foods from your diet, you will control not just your weight but a whole spectrum of health problem from diabetes to heart disease. In some cases, by eliminating casein from the diet, life-threatening cancers have even been driven back.

The only way I felt I could prove or disprove this to myself was to try what the film is advocating. My wife, my parents and I all jumped onto what is essentially a vegan diet for 30 days. In the case of my parents, they had blood tests prior to starting to provide a benchmark. The results could not have been clearer in the first month.

- My father lost 20 pounds and reversed a 20-year reliance on beta blockers and other blood pressure medications. His blood pressure dropped from a stage 2 hypertension level to normal. A very high LDL reading in the blood work reduced to normal along with 5 other indicators that were flagged. He also felt like he had more energy, stopped snoring and found the floaters in his eyes disappeared.
- My mother lost 15 pounds and found great improvement in her arthritic knees. 4 indicator in her blood work also returned to normal levels.
- My wife lost 10 pounds and reported feeling generally more energetic and awake.
- I lost 15 pounds, felt an energy boost and general improvements all over.

After 30 days, we continued on this diet to see what else might change and have been eating this way for nearly six months now. My father has lost nearly 50 pounds in total and has stabilized at a body weight that I've never seen him at before. I have found a dramatic improvement in my eyesight, requiring new glasses for a 1.5 improvement in both eyes. All four of us have passed medical checkups with flying colors. While my experience with this diet cannot speak to curing heart disease or cancers, my eyesight improvement is something that I thought would never happen, having had a pretty bad but stable prescription for 25 years.

So it's no small claim to say that this documentary changed my life. Eating out has become more of a challenge and a couple of times when I veered off the diet to have a steak or piece of fish, I really haven't enjoyed the meal. Walking around supermarkets, I started to realize that most of what we used to buy was just junk full of with high fructose corn syrup and unnatural fillers. But the real joy is that I can really taste the food I eat now, without the need for all the additional salt, sugar, butter and oil that's buried in almost everything we buy. Since starting all this, I read The China Study which is referenced in the film and bought the Engine2 Diet, which has some great recipes. It's taken a while to learn how to cook again but have actually managed to develop a good menu that we all enjoy.

If you're skeptical of the film's claims, I'd recommend trying it out for yourself. While I was initially hesitant to take its promises on face value, I certainly have no trouble believing them now.",1330041600,21,3211,4.5773913043478265

4556215,1,B0053ZHZI2,"""Forks Over Knives"" can make quite an impression. Despite the occasionally slow documentary style, the film, which compares seemingly rock-solid scientific data with impressive anecdotal examples of four individuals who benefit greatly from ""whole-foods plant-based diets,"" seems to make an incontrovertible case for veganism.

The trouble is, the science is far from incontrovertible, the examples are cherry picked and over-simplified, and the whole charade is shamelessly agenda-driven.

The whole film is predicated on a series of purposefully misleading assertions, made to portray the highly questionable ""science"" discussed as unquestionably certain. ""The China Study"" - Dr. Campbell's huge epidemiological study of Chinese diets, which is referred to repeatedly in the film as indisputable scientific gospel - is anything but.

I am often distrustful of reviewers who refer to external authorities, but there are groundbreaking critiques of the study, and any prospective viewer willing to give $15 and 2 hours to watching this film would do well to dedicate an hour to double checking the highly dubious science. Denise Minger's brilliant dissection of the studies is a great place to start: [Just Google ""Denise Minger China Study""; she has a special section on this film].

The use of the China study isn't the only instance of misleading in the film. When discussing an asserted relationship between ""meat protein"" and cancer, for example, they neglect to make clear that this relationship was only shown in rats (not generally milk-drinkers) fed abnormally high levels of not meat but the isolated milk protein casein. No such relationship was shown between actual MEAT consumption and cancer rates (or, for that matter, the other main milk protein, whey, and cancer) - although the filmmakers are happy to bulldoze this fact by fabricating a false positive (that Minger dissects) from the China Study.

Moreover, the success stories in the film are truly inspirational, but they hardly merit the simple explanations the agenda-driven doctors give them. When a former junk-food addict who had never tried a serious diet is made to drop all refined and processed foods and sugars, exercise regularly, consult regularly with a personal dietician, and eat significantly smaller meals, it's hardly certain that their weight-loss and health successes are due exclusively (or at all) to the elimination of meat from their diet.

This misdirection (always blaming meat, never with any evidence) makes sense only once you realize that this film is hardly concerned with the accurate science, because its goal - making veganism appear to be the only healthy option - is at odds with the actual nutritional evidence.

""Forks Over Knives"" is in interesting film, and one that could certainly make an impact on your life. By all means, watch it - but I'd strongly caution fellow viewers against taking it as gospel, and I'd certainly encourage them to give the counter-evidence a reasonable shot.",1329436800,59,2997,5.363829787234042

4556218,5,B0053ZHZI2,"In the United States and other industrialized nations, there is an epidemic of metabolic disorders, vascular diseases, and cancer. This video presents some of the intriguing studies from nutritional epidemiology and translates the information into some simple rules to eat by. The maxim of ""you are what you eat"" means that if your diet is heavy on meat and processed foods, there is a very good chance you will be overweight and at high risk for the big killer diseases (heart disease, cancer, stroke).

Here are some key points from the documentary:

1. A diet heavy on animal protein will increase your risk of cancer and vascular diseases. The lab studies in animals show that a diet where 20% of the calories come from animal protein is associated with substantially increased risk of disease relative to a diet where only 5% of the calories come from animal protein. Laboratory and observational studies in humans find similar effects. Since animal proteins seem to have a similar impact whether from dairy, meat, or eggs, it means that meat is not your friend. Add in the hormone and antibiotic slop given to factory-farmed animals and you have a recipe for disaster.

2. The calorie, salt, fat, and sugar density of many processed foods will blow out your waistline, clog your arteries, and increase your risk for cancers of the digestive system. That means that ""snack"" foods are as bad for you as smoking. Ditto for what you find on most fast food menus.

3. The healthiest choices are for a diet dominated by fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Doing so will give all the nutrients, protein, fiber, and calories you need.

The documentary focuses on some of the pioneers of nutritional epidemiology. Two or three decades ago, their ideas were truly revolutionary. Now, mainstream medicine has gradually embraced these ideas to the point where organizations like the Cancer Project, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, and even the stodgy old American Medical Association make similar recommendations.

From an entertainment standpoint, ""Forks Over Knives"" is far less provocative and evocative than something like Morgan Spurlock's ""Supersize Me"" documentary. It is designed more to make you think rather than squirm.

The choice boils down to whether you want to have a diet that helps prevent you from getting sick or be forced to pop pills for too many ills as the cost from eating what Madison Avenue wants you to buy.

The only quibble I would raise is that the documentary focuses only on the potential savings from reducing health care costs for our society. However, the reality is that eating a diet heavy on fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, legumes, and whole grains will be more expensive and time-consuming than what is typically found in the shopping carts of most Americans.

Coupled with the book The China Study, and a few other informative videos (like Food, Inc.) you will get a picture of how nutrition and health are inexorably linked.
Unfortunately, we are manipulated by a culture of excess and marketing that has far less than our best interests at heart.  Prepared foods, restaurant foods, cooking shows all contribute to a diet saturated with fats, sodium, preservatives and scary chemistry that wreaks slow havoc with our fragile systems.  The word ""natural"" has become a euphemism.
The four case studies followed in the film, though somewhat anecdotal, do present proof that is repeated daily in the offices of health professionals across the globe.  The sad news is that physicians, by their own admission, are taught little, if any, nutrition while in school.  With the insidious influence of the drug industry, their curricula is more devoted to medication and treatment, not prevention.  Surgery and drugs play an important role, to be sure, in getting people to a healthy state, but it is high time that prevention got its fair billing in media, medicine and government sponsored programs.  The inestimable benefits of preventive care would have a most profound effect on the ever escalating cost of health care in our country.  Not a palatable prospect for industries that only make money when we get sick.

Finally, a Clue to Explain Why You Should Avoid Red Meat

November 9, 2008

Several years ago, Professor Ajit Varki of the University of California, San Diego discovered a molecule called Neu5Gc that appears in the tissues of every mammal except humans (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, September 29, 2003). Now he has put together the pieces of a puzzle that may explain why humans evolved with large brains and why, if we want to live into old age, we should probably avoid eating meat from any other mammals (Science, October 31, 2008).

His theory depends on evolution. Living creatures on earth started as one-celled organisms, progressed to 2 cells, and eventually to fish and birds. A mutation occurred in progressing to mammals, who developed the gene to make Neu5Gc. Mammals progressed to apes and Neanderthals, and as humans evolved, Neu5Gc added a single oxygen atom to become a different molecule called Neu5Ac. So Neu5Gc is found in all mammals and their milks except humans. It is not in fish or birds. Interestingly, the Neu5Ac molecule explains why humans are the only mammal to suffer from malaria. The malaria parasite cannot enter a cell until it grabs onto the Neu5Ac on the surface of human cells.

Many epidemiological studies show that people who eat red meat are at increased risk for heart attacks, strokes, at least 17 different cancers, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, arthritis and asthma. Scientists have blamed saturated fats or burnt fats, but this does not explain why red meat is linked to all of these diseases while poultry, fish or saturated fats from plants are not.

Dr. Varki proposes another theory. When humans ingest the flesh or milk of any mammal, they absorb Neu5Gc and treat it the same way as an invading germ, so they make antibodies against it. This turns on their immunity and keeps it active so it eventually attacks the host itself, the human body. This is called chronic inflammation, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, cancers and so forth.

Since humans cannot make Neu5Gc, any amount found in human cells come from the mammals that they have eaten. Neu5Gc is found in high levels in tumors, with the highest levels in metastasizing tumors. In our food supply, Dr. Varki found very high levels of Neu5Gc in beef, pork, lamb and goat, and moderately high amounts in milk and cheese. Low levels are found in turkey, duck, chicken and eggs; and negligible amounts occur in plants and seafood.

I stopped eating meat many years ago, and this report makes me even more convinced that it should be avoided. I eat lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and nuts, as well as fish and shellfish. Eggs, long thought to be a harmful high- cholesterol food, now appear to be a healthful dietary staple. While poultry appears to be a healthful food according to Dr. Varki's theory, I still do not eat it. I do not drink milk and now plan to limit cheese as well.",1327795200,4,3169,4.789377289377289
4556243,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Most documentaries seem to be pushing an agenda...people either love the movie or hate it based on their own political beliefs. This movie is much different, because the two people it focuses on are scientists who are widely respected for their work. The facts these scientists talk about - the effects of a plant-based diet on human health - are hard to argue with. Sure, you can quibble over the details here and there, but health benefits they discuss are well-documented.

Professionally, I am a scientist (not in the area of health); personally, I am a skeptic (and a meat-eater for most of my life). I take a conservative, skeptical approach to everything, both in my work and in my personal life. That said, this film is quite convincing, without becoming to preachy. It is also a good introduction to this subject. If you want to do your own research on the effects of a plant-based diet, then this film is a good starting point. I stopped eating meat and dairy shortly before I saw this because of other health reasons - not heart disease or diabetes or weight-related issues.

4556245,5,B0053ZHZI2,"My daughter introduced me to this documentary and it has changed my life.
I am a type II Diabetic diagnosed in 1996.  I was taking 20 units three times a day of Novolog and 60 units of Lantus before bed, as well as Metformin 500mg 2 morning one noon and three evening and Glipizide 5 mg four times a day.  Additionally I am taking Linsinoprol 40mg in evening and Metroprolol 50mg in the morning for high blood pressure. I have Diabetic nueropathy in my fingers and from my calf through my feet, I am primarily numb not experiencing nueropathic pain.  i have had nueropathy symptoms for at least eleven years.  Forks over knives.
I read a book a few months ago called the thirty day miracle diabetes cure.  I had also seen a study done with a small group of diabetics in England where they went on a six hundred calorie a day diet and saw their need for insulin and medications eliminated in most cases.  The diet was primarily fruit and veggies in both cases.  So on November first of this year I decided to take the plunge and go vegetarian.  I was able over the course of the first three weeks eliminate the need to take Insulin injections completely.  Then on  Thanksgiving at my Daughters, she introduced me to the Forks over Knives video which I then purchased.  Over the last two weeks I have gone from Vegetarian to vegan and am trying to eliminate oil and fats as much as possible.  I am finally down to the 10-12 grams a day range for fat consumption and consuming at least 40 grams a day of fiber.  In the last week I have been able to reduce my Diabetes and Blood pressure medications by 50%.  I look forward to the day when I can eliminate them completely.

I became interested in taking control of my health over the last couple of years after an episode in Sept of 2009.  I went into renal failure and was hospitalized.  Somehow during that time they found a blood clot in my lower left leg.  It turned out that two of the three arteries feeding my foot were over 90% blocked.  An angioplasty was performed but in the time it took to diagnose and treat the clot, I had a small blood blister on the bottom of my foot go south to the point where my two smallest toes were black.  We tried to save them but to no avail.  In October I had the two toes and a portion of my foot below them amputated.  I also experienced three hospitalizations with anti biotic resistant infections.  After the amputation I still had some Osteomylitus in the next toe and foot bones below the site.  I went through 75 hyperbaric dives along with Wound vac treatment and was able to eliminate the bone infection.  I have also been using infrared light therapy to increase circulation through vasodilation and the production of nitric oxide and also promoting long term angiogenesis.

In the video I was most intrigued by the segment on endothelial cells and nitric oxide.  I have been selling infrared light therapy devices to physical therapists, Podiatrists and Endocrinologists for over ten years used primarily in the treatment of nueropathies and wound healing.  This treatment produces changes on a localized basis over the area treated similar to the systemic changes described in the video as a result of a Vegan Diet.

 The good news already is that in the last fifty days I have lost over twenty pounds.  Bringing my total loss since this summer to 49 ponds of the 100 I hope to eventually lose in getting back to my college weight(33 years ago).",1327708800,2,3446,4.500805152979066
4556246,4,B0053ZHZI2,"I feel compelled to say right away, that this documentary does get a bit bland and boring during some segments, and although the information presented is worth its cost, there are other DVD's out there that do a much more entertaining job in informing its viewers about the benefits of a plant based diet (entertaining, not better I want to stress).

The reason why I bought this DVD, was simply because of Dr Colin Campbell, who has made it his life work to challenge our conventional wisdom about dietary excellence and what it actually constitutes. His magnum opus if you will, is his book 'The China Study' which he coauthored with his son, one of the most important studies ever done about how diet and diseases are linked.

First and foremost, to the uniformed, the idea of a plant-based diet, devoid of any or having very little animal products (eg meat and dairy) can be a pretty challenging and scary thought. The first instinct is to criticize this premise. But perhaps the best retort to people who object, is to ask, whether or not our current eating patterns as a nation deserve to be called 'healthy'?

I live in Australia, and currently it is the most over-weight nation on earth (the U.S.A. is the most morbidly obese) and everywhere I walk, I see more than my fair share of over-weight people. Obviously something has gone wrong, you can blame the government, fast-food corporations, the 'Americanisation' of the worlds food supply or whatever, the fact doesn't change though that the current eating patterns of most developed, English speaking countries is horrendous. So if what we did, was simply dramatically increased our consumptions of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, eliminated or reduce animal products and stayed away from processed foods, the result would be a healthier and slimmer YOU!

It seems like commonsense, but sometimes commonsense is very uncommon.

The current low carb craze spreading like wildfire is a new phenomenon. But if you watch this DVD, it explores nations in Asia, whose main source of calories is rice, a carbohydrate! People in Asia eating a traditional high carbohydrate diet, are trim don't usually don't suffer from the health afflictions plaguing the West. Why is that so, is it a genetic predisposition towards wellness that people in Asia have? Well that can't be it, because it's well documented that the more acculturated people from Asia become to the Western diet, their risk of heart disease and cancer sky rockets like everyone else's in the West. So that can't be it?

This DVD explores the research of Dr Colin Campbell and Dr Caldwell Esseltyn, and how they found the answer to questions like this, and many more, whilst butchering a few sacred cows in the process (speaking metaphorically of course).",1327708800,3,2775,4.9314775160599575

Small or even large amounts of animal products could have yielded the same, better, or worse results - we have no idea.

The China Study itself leaps to some interesting conclusion. They didn't study vegans in China. So it's a reasonable guess that if eating less meat improved health eating no meat must be better - BUT THAT IS A GUESS. Good science doesn't rely on guessing.

Anyone who moves from a diet of processed foods to a diet of whole plant foods is going to see some positive results.  However, I had to give this film a low rating because the idea that a plant based diet is optimal for everyone is simply not accurate.  As always, I learned this the hard way.  Let me explain....

Two years ago, in August of '09, I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, incurable cancer of the bone marrow. I declined conventional medicine and did the Gerson Therapy for two years. It involves 12 vegetable juices a day, coffee enemas and a fruit/vegetable vegan diet; no salt, limited spices, very strict. After two years on the therapy, my disease was stable (it worsened the first few months and then held stable) and I was exhausted. I couldn't figure out why I was so tired. I had encouraged my friends to drink green juice and some of them experienced incredible energy highs; yet, I drank four green juices a day for two years and was exhausted.

Since I didn't feel well and I hadn't improved, I switched to the Gonzalez protocol, another alternative cancer therapy that I read about in Suzanne Somers' Knockout book. Dr. Gonzalez told me to eat red meat 4-5 times per week plus butter, eggs and dairy; all organic, all whole foods, of course. He prescribes a different diet for everyone based on genetics; some patients are on plant based, raw diets and others eat red meat three times a day. I happen to be in the middle of the vegetarian/carnivore spectrum so I eat a variety of plant and animal foods. Once I moved from a plant based diet to a diet that includes a lot of red meat and other animal products, my cancer began melting away and my energy returned. It is amazing and I am thrilled!

Given that Dr. Gonzalez is the only doctor I know who is successfully (he has a 70-80% success rate with his ""incurable"" cancer patients) reversing all types of late stage cancers without the use of conventional treatment, I'm inclined to believe he is right.  Unfortunately, I don't believe any of the experts associated with this film are accomplishing anything comparable to Dr. Gonzalez.

Sure, there is the woman whose breast cancer was reversed by a plant based diet.  That makes sense because, according to Dr. Gonzalez, people with solid tumors of the breast, lungs, stomach, pancreas, colon, liver, prostate, uterus and ovaries need a vegetarian based diet.  It makes sense that the plant based diet worked for her.  However, for the 30-40% of us who need red meat, that diet could have been a disaster.

The point here is that a plant based diet works for some but certainly not for everyone. Anyone with a blood disease such as leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma needs red meat, sometimes in very large quantities. If a plant based diet makes you feel great, then that's what you should consume. But it doesn't work for everyone and it didn't work for me.

We all need to tune into our bodies and be honest with ourselves about how certain foods make us feel.  Listen to your body, not the academic ""experts"", to tell you the truth.",1325980800,606,3258,4.589655172413793

4556267,4,B0053ZHZI2,"I found this very interesting and informative.  It certainly has made me think about incorporating more plant based foods into my diet, not that I don't eat veggies and fruits now.  But not much was stressed about exercise and the role that would play in balancing an animal based diet along with plant based foods.  Also there was no mention of fish or seafood.  Though these are animals (or amphibians?) there was no negative evidence or discussions about having these foods in your diet.  And lastly, I think there needs to be a healthy and realistic balance to any diet.  I think this documentary would have been more effective to show that you can still have a piece of birthday cake or a low-fat dessert once in awhile.  Not sure I agree that one's diet has to be an all or nothing proposition.  Perhaps initially if you're suffering from heart disease or are very overweight I could see trying an all plant based diet but surely there's nothing wrong with adding a little chicken or seafood to one's diet--along with the veggies, fruit and salads.  I certainly agree with cutting out certain things such as the fast food junk, especially all the fried stuff and gluttonnish desserts.  But please everyone needs a realistic balance.

Farms that raise plants contribute huge amounts of polution in the form of pesicides and nitrates to our water systems. Animals can be raised on land unsuitable for cultivation, in humane and healthy ways.  However, the premise that eating animal proteins causes most of our modern diseases is reason enough to try some of the very interesting recipes in this book. For the most part, the recipes seem to be simple to prepare, without too many exotic ingredients, and very healthy. The recipe for making a substitute for cheese to use in Quesadillas, without using tofu, is worth the price of the book. Soybean products like tofu are contributing a lot to global warming ( rain forests are being cut down to plant soy beans), and pollution (almost all soybeans are GMO ,genetically modified, and grown in a chemical bath). They also contain hormone like substances that could contribute to the growth of cancer. This book contains lots of recipes without tofu, so is to be recommended.",1325116800,3,1127,4.83419689119171

4556278,2,B0053ZHZI2,"When viewing movies involving subjects which have such power to affect our lives in either a negative or positive way, we need to be very discerning. Studies can be manipulated and propaganda is rife. In all areas....not just with this movie...we desperately need to learn the tacitcs and methods of persuasion and manipulation if we want to maintain our freedoms.

The very title of this film...Forks Over Knives....  is telling us to eliminate a whole food group from our diet. To avoid disinformation, we need to look at history and anthropological works on nutrition. Modern day research in the medical field and in the nutrition field often has more to do with corporate interests and control rather than health and well-being. I respect people who are vegetarians and vegans when they are doing so for religious or what they feel are moral reasons....but if they are following these types of diets for health reasons then they really need to read works such as the classic anthropological study by Weston Price....Nutrition and Physical Degeneration. Other helpful books are Deep Nutrition, The Vegetarian Myth and Vitamin K2 and The Calcium Paradox.

The movie, Forks Over Knives does have some good points. It is obvious to most of us why we need to shun processed foods. This is  excellent advice. However,having done some research in the art of propaganda, I have learned that we need to closely evaluate all information we are exposed to. Often partial truths are used...in books, on the news, on the internet and in film....to persuade and to promote certain goals or agendas. Partial truths are often used ...even by ""supposed"" alternative media...to draw us in. When it is made to appear that the producers or authors are against the corporations or establishment and seem to be on our side...then we tend to take the rest of their information in with less scrutiny. Don't get me wrong...there is nothing wrong with vegetables (except perhaps pesticide residues and less nutrition due to poor soil). We need vegetables and berries and some fruits for a well balanced diet. Forks Over Knives advocates little or no animal fat in the diet,and no meat or animal products. If people are basing their nutrition ideas on The China Study...then again...one needs to read Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by Weston Price and some of the articles which rebutt The China Study.

One of the main issues the movie should have focused on concerns the way animals are raised in modern factory farms and the food the animals are fed. When ruminants are fed corn instead of grass this practice changes their whole fat ratio. In addition when animals are raised inside they no longer have access to the sun and the animal fat can no longer be relied upon to provide us with substances such as K2, Vit D...etc. You may find this hard to believe but pastured pork fat (lard) was considered to be very nourishing and was used often in cooking. The fat on meat helps us to digest the meat. We also need fat to aid the body in absorbing the fat soluble vitamins and also the minerals. An all plant diet may be good for a short period of time for the purpose of detoxification but if this diet is followed for life, one is apt to suffer deficiencies which only show up later in life. Fat is needed for reproduction and especially for the growth and healthy bone structure of the fetus and growing child. Our brains are largely composed of cholesterol. It is not cholesterol that causes heart disease....it's the sugar and processed foods that negatively influence how our bodies handle and store the cholesterol.

Weston Price(author of Nutrition and Physical Degeneration [...] ) was hoping to find cultures that were totally vegetarian or what we now term vegan. He did find some groups who ate less animal food but he did not discover ANY cultures that were totally vegan. He discovered that those who ate the more starchy diets, were less robust and were easily overtaken by other groups or societies. If one is thinking of eating no meat or animal products,don't just listen to modern propaganda but go to the older books and try to find research that substantiates that there are cultures who have been able to reproduce through generations on a total plant diet.

I was also disappointed that the movie did not address the serious issue of plant anti-nutrients and toxins.....or the extreme importance of fermenting our foods in order to provide the good bacteria which is a vital part of our immune system. Grains, such as oatmeal, wheat, rice, quinoa...etc...need to be soaked before cooking to remove the protective plant substances which when present in the food, keeps us from assimilating and or absorbing certain vital nutrients. I am continually amazed at how our ancestors knew to do these things...without formal studies and chemistry labs. Additionally we should not eat certain vegetables raw for the same reason.

The movie also did not address the vital issue of fermentation. Fermentation was used by our ancestors to store food but this process also rendered certain anti-nutrients as harmless and even increased the nutrient values of food. Beneficial bacteria from fermented foods is another absolute must for anyone who wants to maintain robust health and avoid infectious disease. Instead of getting a flu shot...buy yourself a fermentation crock..

The movie, Forks Over Knives also fails to mention the fact that historically people ate meat and meat products and thrived without heart attacks. The Native American Indians ate alot of guts and grease and had magnificient bone structure and respect for nature. They preferred the older animals as they had a better accumulation of fat. We need fat and we can thrive on meat and animal products....BUT these animals must be treated humanely and raised on pasture, eating their natural food. When the animals are healthy, they pass on their health to us. This is also very obvious in the animal kingdom.

So...if you haven't yet watched this movie.....please do so with a discerning eye and take the time to research what our ancestors really ate and just as importantly....how they prepared their foods before cooking.",1325030400,11,6190,4.948989412897016

2. The format fot he book does not make sense.  Biographies are randomly interjected throughout the text.  Imagine trying to read a 20 page essay, but having read a biography between each page.  This is the format for the book.

3. The information presented in the book lightly touches on nutrition.  It is a compilation of biographies and recipes.  I could have put this book together myself.

4556283,5,B0053ZHZI2,"It's a movie everyone should watch and consider how they eat and how it affects their health. I'm a scientist by profession and have been following the authors for a while now. They skim over the details as to why  animal proteins up-regulate cell growth, including cancer cells, but other researchers have known this for the past 30 years or so. The computer generated graphics are a great tool for giving a tangible, visualization of what is happening inside the body when you eat animal products. The movie does a good job at ""connecting the dots"" between the various etiologies of the major modern diseases converging on animal products, but they could easily write a sequel explaining how other diseases/conditions like diverticulitis, gout, kidney stones and various auto-immune disorders are tied to animal products.

There will be some criticism over the simplicity in which complex phenomena are explained, but I give them credit for making the complexity ""digestible"" to the lay person. You can always follow up with your own personal research on the topics presented in the movie. Some folks will try to discredit this movie in anyway they can, b/c of their cultural bias toward meat eating.

I would burn 5,000-10,000Cal/day on my riding days, all fueled only by plants. I haven't been sick, not even colds in those 6 years. I wish I had grown up eating like this.

4556297,1,B0053ZHZI2,"I just watched ""Forks Over Knives,"" and, in my opinion, I found it to be full of half-truths, over-simplifications, falsehoods, and bad science. Without going into details, they lump meat in with junk food, and then take four fat, sedentary human train wrecks who for years have subsisted on fast food and Red Bull, and replace their diets with fresh fruits and vegetables and get them exercising and, viola! their health has improved dramatically. No surprise there. Contrary to what the movie claims, meat and proteins in general having nothing to do with diabetes, which any health professional will tell you is related to sugar intake, and sugar is a carbohydrate. Also, one of the ""nutrition experts"" asserts that genetics plays no role in disease. That is, quite frankly, nonsense. We know that some people are predisposed to certain diseases based on their genetic make up. That's not myth, it's proven science and medicine.

If you believe in Darwin, evolution, and the concept that organisms evolve to adapt to their environment to survive, then you know we are supposed to eat meat. Homo sapiens have evolved over the last 4 million years as hunters and gatherers, eating a protein-based diet of meat and fish along with fruits, vegetables, and nuts limited to what was available locally and in season. Farming is a practice that's only been around for the last 20,000 years, and 20,000 years is a drop in the bucket in terms of 4 million years of evolution. Want more proof? Open your mouth and look at your teeth. Those four pointy ones in the front corners are called cuspids and are designed for biting into and tearing flesh. Now, look at animals in nature. The ones that naturally eat meat and fish--lions, tigers, bears, wolves, dogs--have them. Animals that eat only plants--rabbits, horses, cows, bison, sheep, squirrels--don't have them. (Also, the former don't watch bad movies that tell them they're eating the wrong stuff.) BTW, Inuits are people indigenous to the Arctic Circle and eat a traditional diet high in protein and fat and zero plants and yet have a low incidence of heart disease. Go figure.

Finally, of all the things in this movie that I take issue with is the stupid, dangerous, and irresponsible message that you can cure yourself of cancer by merely by changing your diet to a plant-based one. I'd be willing to bet it was the reason why Cornell University ""marginalized"" that doctor in this movie. He should have been fired, but he was probably tenured, so that was impossible. Case in point, Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is, in most cases, a virtual death sentence. Mr. Jobs, however, had a rare, operable form of the cancer that has a high cure rate. Mr. Jobs, unfortunately, decided to go with a holistic, whole-foods approach to a cure.

There are worse things that can happen to you than death. Just take that sentence and think about it for a minute. I will say it again: there are worse things that can happen to you than death. By far the worst thing that can happen to you is not a heart attack that kills you...that is merciful. It's having a heart attack and surviving...but not very well. Kept alive on a ventilator, with multiple organ failure, bloated and septic....effectively a living corpse. If you saw how awful an existence it is, you would watch this movie and instantly switch to a plant based diet. This movie is the most profound piece of research to have ever been done, and this is straight from the pen of a learned, 20 year veteran of health care. If you want to buy something meaningful for your loved one this Christmas, or you want to buy yourself something as part of a New Year's resolution, then order this DVD now. It could...no...WILL...save your life. My father died of a heart attack. My mother has diabetes and heart disease. My uncle is currently in hospital awaiting a heart transplant from severe failure.

This movie is without doubt the most impressive testimonial to true, NATURAL health and healing and the benefits of a plant based diet I have ever -- EVER -- seen!!  and I keep track of this kind of material for my clients and family as resources.  This is SO well presented, SO well put together, SO well BALANCED, and SO INFORMATIVE -- using real life examples (before and after), showing the progressive research , interviewing both the researchers and the clients, AND appropriately revealing the misinformation and propaganda that the American public has been conditioned with over the last several decades -- in medicine and the educational system  --  that I consider it a MASTER PIECE of educational information -- to say nothing of constructive entertainment !!  And the food you see prepared in this film is to LIVE for !!

I am a Wholistic Natural Therapist with 30 years of professional experience in whole food nutrition and herbology.  I have been providing nutritional counsel for 30 years, and more importantly consider myself an example of what I teach.  I lift weights, hike, consider myself a young, active 56 years of age, have NO serious health challenges except high levels of self imposed stress.  I hardly eat ANY commercially processed ""JUNK"" foods today and absolutely NO red meat.  I gave up drinking milk  (raw, natural milk -- back when you could still get it)  in 1979  (my nose ran copious amounts of clear mucus for three weeks as I cleaned out ).  I went from a vegetarian diet with some cheese back to eating fish and poultry (mainly turkey) sporadically  (one or two meals every two or three months)  on the advice of a naturopathic doctor / friend after a sudden major illness set me back substantially in 1996.  I added natural organic eggs when I began weight training because I got caught up in that protein myth mentioned in the film -- and I KNEW BETTER !  YET as pristine as my diet may appear to most, I recognize after seeing this film I have slacked off  --  have work to do and improvements to make.  I can use the increased energy, stamina and vitality demonstrated in this movie and the lives documented here.  By the end of the film I was so moved and inspired by the message I was almost in tears.  This film has convinced me to change -- AND IMPROVE -- MY nutritional regime -- RIGHT NOW!  This movie and its scientifically validated material make SO MUCH SENSE it is impossible to deny.  I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE that cannot benefit from this information -- myself included !!  I plan to share this with everybody !!

Doctors Campbell and Esselstyn, Jr. -- the primary researchers in this film -- both men now in their 70's -- are new heroes for me.  They remind me (and the rest of us) of how healthy people USE TO look when I was a youngster growing up.  People were thin, vital, strong, and active.  C'mon, America!!  Brothers, Sisters!!  YOU OWE IT TO YOUR SELF if not your families!!  Buy this film !!  WATCH this film together !!  Talk about this material with family and those you care about.  If it doesn't wake you up to how you are CHOOSING to be sick AND more importantly, how YOU CAN NOW CHOOSE TO BE HEALTHY -- I don't know what will.  If the health benefits don't win you over maybe the idea of NOT spending so much of your hard earned money for unnecessary and ineffective drugs, medical attention, and hospitalization will.  And if you are even half as turned on as I am by all this -- GET THE BOOK of the same title that supports the program documented in the film to show you what to do.  I JUST DID !!

Forgive me for being SO passionate, but this film and material really inspires and excites me.  This information should be hailed from the roof tops and ESPECIALLY shown to Congress and the people setting our dietary agendas!  Honestly, my friends, this is one film that could very well change / SAVE your life!  Don't believe me -- prove it for yourself by getting this DVD -- ESPECIALLY NOW that we are all dealing with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) hidden -- UNLABELED -- in the commercial food supply!!  The only thing you have to loose is your illness, excess weight, over abundance of prescriptions, fatigue, anxiety over disease, and apathy about life!!  CHOOSE TO THRIVE !!

4556323,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I am a Registered Nurse with good working knowledge of diseases and nutrition. Even though I knew and did everything the traditional medical community did and was doing 'all the right things', I was unhealthy, overweight, and at extreme high risk for death! The scientific research taking place over several decades (The China Study) mentioned in the documentary is well documented and makes complete sense. This documentary was a real ""wake up call"" for me. My view of food, the entire food industry, and in particular views on my own health have changed forever. I thought my health problems were ""genetic"" and inevitable, and pretty much expected to get cancer or die of a heart attack and there was little I could do to prevent it, that I was doing all that I could, never imagining that I could take control of my health! I am now empowered with solid knowledge of how to be healthy, to reverse my heart disease and type II Diabetes, to avoid most diseases including cancer, and feel happier and healthier than ever before. The movie follows the life and health of people who have had heart disease as well as some who do not, showing the dramatic improvement in health that a plant based, whole food diet can make. All of my life I loved meat and dairy, but the overwhelming evidence presented in this documentary make me not ever want to put them in my body again. Since I have been vegan, I have lost substantial amount of weight, my doctor has taken me off medication for high blood pressure, Type II Diabetes, migraines, GERD, chronic joint/muscle pain, and high cholesterol. Ino longer have Metabolic Syndrome (key indicator for impending heart attack) and am no longer in the ""high risk"" group for heart disease, in fact my last cardio-checkup and my stress-test were so good, the doctor made me repeat the test because he couldn't believe the improvement, and I have never felt better in my life! Since I have seen the documentary ""Forks Over Knives"", I read The China Study, which dramatically cemented in my head the animal protein effects on the body. We all know cholesterol is bad for us, right? Did you know that ALL bad cholesterol (LDL) comes from animals?

Eat animals = high LDL = heart disease, period!!!  And then there's all the garbage pumped into animals raised for food and all of their stress hormones (from inhumane treatment NOT protected by animal cruelty law because they aren't ""pets""!) released into their bodies you take in when you eat them.

I was like most people, not thinking about where my food came from, or what it was invisibly doing to my body. I was letting animal agriculture lobbyists dictate to the government what I can and cannot know about the food I was eating, and believing the ""whitewash"" propaganda. I was a victim of the country's healthcare system that wants us to be sick, taking expensive medications and getting expensive treatments and surgeries, and I blindly expected my doctor to tell me whatever is best for me; and I was getting sicker each year. I had my first heart attack in 1998 at the age of 39, and immediately began eating exactly as the American Heart Association told me to: no fried foods, only lean cuts of meat, cutting out most red meats and sweets, eating more fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise. I continued to develop plaque in my arteries, and developed angina. In 2009 I had another heart attack, and had a stint placed. I was counseled by a Dietician who felt I was already on a very heart-healthy diet and exercise program and told to 'keep doing what you are doing' 2 months later I had another heart attack, and was put on statin meds (along with other prescriptions I was already taking for Diabetes, GERD, hypertension, chronic pain, frequent migraines, and angina) and told by the cardiologist I should ""get my affairs in order"", there was nothing more ""they"" could do and pretty much gave me a death sentence. So I lived thinking I was dying. Until I decided to do something on my own, acquire knowledge, and I found this life-changing information presented in this movie.

Three months into a diet based entirely on plants with no dairy, eggs, processed food, and little oil, I had lost 35 pounds and my blood sugars were normal, and my GERD was gone and I was able to get off those prescriptions. After 5 months on the diet, I was able to get off my blood pressure medicine and the NSAIDs for chronic pain, and had lost another 20 pounds. I had not had an episode of angina nor have I had a migraine since my starting on a plant-based diet, so I don't need my Nitro or pain meds for migraine anymore. My arterial blockages which were at 70 and 85% are cleared completely. I have effectively reversed my heart disease and type II Diabetes, cured my GERD, migraines, and angina. I am heart attack proof and will not get most types of cancer, all thanks to the research of Drs Esslestyn (Forks Over Knives) and Campbell (The China Study) and being able to commit to a whole foods, plant based diet.

I have now been able to eliminate oil from my diet as well. I always enjoyed my food before, and sure, I miss some aspects of the normal, American diet, but I do NOT miss what it was doing to me; it was killing me! I really love all of the colorful and nutritious food I eat nw on a vegan diet, and so does my husband and son, who also eat a strong plant based diet after learning from The China Study and Forks Over Knives. I am 52 years old now, and have the energy and health of a 25 year old. I have so much energy! I can't believe after feeling ""old"" tired, and sick every day for 20 plus years, that I am feeling this good and not taking ANY prescriptions! To tell you the truth, I am very worried about our country's new healthcare plan that goes into effect next year, and was pretty sure with my health issues, I would be passed over for care, and probably not be able to get the medicines I was prescribed to keep me alive. Now I do not have that worry, I simply don't have health issues anymore!

I hope you will not wait until you are at the point I was to feed your body a truly healthful diet instead of a death diet. Sure, I had nothing else to lose by trying it, but IT WORKED, and anyone who eats a whole food (no processed stuff) plant based diet will become their healthiest self. I am healthy now, and even if you don't have health problems, wouldn't you want only the best for your body?

The antibiotics were said to have weakened the teeth by multiple dentists. Now, from chewing raw, hard, unprocessed, fibrous foods, I was able to help remineralize my teeth from at the point of ""you need a root canal"" to being pain-free, with straighter teeth, because the teeth are getting the exercise they need.

4556335,5,B0053ZHZI2,"For years, I've been 'experimenting' with diets. I'm not overweight, but I never felt healthy and something told me a lot of it was food related.  I've had problems with my stomach, muscle and joint pain, anxiety,  depression, and exhaustion. Back in 1990 I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I was glad. Somebody had given it a name.  For 2 decades I experimented with natural alternatives and conventional health remedies. I would feel better for a little while and just when I thought the problem was solved something else would happen. I was diagnosed with a mild case of diverticulosis and later a hiatal hernia. I'd read where people who had FM improved when they went on a gluten-free diet. I tried it and felt better, but I noticed there were times that I still had flare ups that left me sick and exhausted. I had decided after all this years that I needed to accept that this is the way life would be for me. In other words, I'd basically given up.

Then one night I watched ""Fork Over Knives"". The evidence was compelling. I wasn't sure if I could go totally vegan, but I was pretty sure I could be a vegetarian. I bought an expensive blender (Vitamixer) began making green smoothies, homemade humus, black bean spreads, and soups. I gave up meat ""cold turkey""-pun intended. In about a week, I was sleeping the night. My muscles and joints quit aching. I didn't have acid reflux. My energy level was through the roof. Most of all I felt calm, relaxed, and happy.

It's a very informative movie to the point that I definitely will watch it 2 or 3 more times in order to make notes. There's no way people can memorize all this.

In comparison with Joe Cross' ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" I give ""Forks over Knives"" only 4 stars as it is a bit confusing with the many stories starting, then getting interrupted by some old health documentary clips or very short interviews with the two doctors and then all off a sudden the story of the patient continues.
I know this is typical for the way they make movies (and write books) nowadays. Maybe movie directors think that all people have a short attention span and that something new has to get introduced every few minutes, before the original story can get finished?
That is my only complaint.

I wish they had told the entire story of the African American woman, then the entire story of the man, then the story of the female runner etc and THEN the complete interviews with the doctors. It would have been easier to follow.

But today stories have to be split into a puzzle and (hopefully) by the end of the film or book everything falls into place.

It may be hard for some conventional thinkers to swallow (pardon the pun), but my independent reading of studies since the early 1900s strongly support the conclusions.

4556363,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This is a movie with massive evidence for the common sense prevention of and relief from disease. The two scientists at the center of the film, an elite physician who also happens to be an Olympic gold medalist (rowing; 1956),  and an equally elite Cornell University nutrition scientist, make their points professionally, without bombast or vitriol.  I have listed the movie's overwhelming assets and a few liabilities, as follows.

ASSETS

Having come into the natural foods movement circa 1977 with macrobiotics, I'm aware that Georges Ohsawa, the hereditary Samurai and extraordinary Japanese philosopher of food said everything Drs. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn have documented and in my judgement something more. Ohsawa and his followers had significant influence in the alternative movement but almost always on the margins of the mainstream, with the exception of some spectacular success with high profile cancer patients like Dr. Anthony Satillaro of Methodist Hospital, Philadelphia. But the hard-core science wasn't there -- yet. It's been a long journey from 1977, and Campbell and Esselstyn and their colleagues provide the science, and ""Forks and Knives"" does a fine job of presenting it. For anyone with an open mind this movie will change lives. How much it will change the huge investment corporate America has in the mass marketing and industrialization of dairy foods and meat remains to be seen. Even on the leafy ivy league campus of Cornell University, Dr. Campbell was persecuted by his own department and had his class schedule reduced, because of his findings.

LIBABILITIES

There aren't many, otherwise I would not have awarded five stars. I will concentrate on three issues. First, the nutrition study ordered by Zhou Enlai (pronounced: ""Joe N Lie"") toward the end of his life, is presented in this film with high praise, without mentioning that Zhou was a brutal Chinese communist dictator. Whitewashing Zhou was a moral failing and a blunder.

Second, the film should have stuck to nutrition: its brief segment on global warming was dogma. Earth is undergoing climate change alright: it's getting colder in some areas and hotter in others. ""Global warming"" as a general description of our planet's climate is a canard. It should not have been endorsed in this film.

Finally, the movie misses some insights that macrobiotic localism could offer. For example, if you're in good health and happy with your weight and overall physical condition and you are primarily of European genetic background, it is not going to harm you to have some good quality organic goat cheese or organic turkey now and then; more as a condiment than a main food, and on occasion as the main course. Genetics does play a part in our relationship to our food. This was missed by ""Forks and Knives."" Moreover, a diet of conventional fruits, vegetables and grains, loaded with pesticides, herbicides and in the case of corn and soy, genetic modification, is undoubtedly a contributor to poor health in some people. The movie makes no distinctions between conventional and organic foods.

SUMMARY

If you are now afflicted with, or wish to prevent, heart disease, stroke, cancer or diabetes, among other ailments, this is the motivational science movie for you. I wish ""Forks and Knives"" could be broadcast on PBS nationwide and distributed on DVD to every teenager in America, along with a follow-up network of foodies who could help get people started and weaned off large quantities of meat, diary, high fructose syrup and heavily processed food. We are spending needless billions on health care for preventable diseases. Twice a year, breast cancer awareness campaigns sweep the nation with demands for funding for a cure. I have seen what the pink-shirted workers involved in these campaigns consume while they are volunteering. They don't have a clue about the diet connection to breast cancer. This ignorance must stop. The cure for breast and other cancers is before our eyes and ""Knives over Forks"" makes the connection explicit, in a powerful way. Bottom line: you dig your grave with your teeth.

I wish they taught this (proper nutrition) in our U.S. school systems.  Our country would be much better off than it is now, health-wise.",1318204800,,329,4.360655737704918
4556366,4,B0053ZHZI2,"""Forks and Knives"" is in many ways a film adaptation of the groundbreaking book, ""The China Study"" (2006).

While the movie echoes the findings of the book, it also introduces some additional characters to those that appeared in the book (i.e. Dr. Esselstyn and his son, the Director Lee Fulkerson, and others).

In addition to these new characters, the medium of film also offers (readers and non-readers of the book alike) experiences the book cannot offer: images that impact viewers in a unique and powerful way.

For example, seeing how darn young, vibrant, and healthy both Dr. Esselstyn (78) and Dr. Campbell (77) look is as powerful an endorsement for the health findings they espouse as any. So to is the utterly complete health transformation that Fulkerson undergoes, while adapting the lifestyle Dr.'s Campbell and Esselstyn champion, across the filming of the documentary. These images are unique to the film, and impossible to ignore.

Also, for an introduction to the life's work and nutritional findings of Dr. Colin T. Campbell, the film at only ninety-six minutes long may offer a more digestible and efficient way for readers to familiarize themselves with his findings.

""Forks and Knives"", like ""The China Study"" espouses a whole food, plant-based lifestyle. Naming is important here. A ""whole food, plant-based lifestyle"" is different than a ""Vegan diet"". ""Vegan"" is a powerfully charged word that denotes certain spiritual and moral-responsibility components, which serve to turn a conversation about health into so much more.

Lee Fulkerson in ""Forks and Knives"" consciously refers to to the findings of Dr. Campbell's not as Vegan, but only as evidence in support for eating only plant-based and whole foods.

Dr. Campbell and Lee Fulkerson are no ideologues. The tone of this film is not fiery and finger-pointy. Dr.'s Campbell and Esselstyn practice the lifestyle they encourage (which is also on a separate note the lifestyle President Clinton adopted after his bypass surgery).

This documentary cooly presents an overwhelming set of facts and findings about the concurrent rise in the consumption of animal-based foods and the preponderance of ""Diseases of Affluence"", namely cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

The film demonstrates many nutritional myths that survive in modern society (for example, high-performing athletes cannot excel exclusively on plant-based, whole foods).

The film demonstrates how one can get all the nutrition that the body needs in a whole food, plant-based lifestyle, while also avoiding all the bad cholesterol and high saturated fats (which are leading causes of the world's most deadly diseases) present in animal foods.

This film answers many of the most common, gut instinct responses people often have to the findings of Dr. Campbell: if the nutritional way forward is so simple, why have I not heard this message before? How can I get all the calcium I need with this diet? ""Diseases of Affluence"" are so genetically determined, why does it even matter whether I eat animal-based foods?

The science behind this film is thorough (something the book ""Skinny Bitch"" was criticized for not being) and compelling. Simply stated- it is hard to watch this film and not have it impact your life in some way.",1318118400,8,3279,5.2247619047619045

If you can't commit to reading all the books with all the data, this move is for you. If you can at least spare 90 minutes to watch this movie, it may save your life! I myself have slowly switched to a largely plant-based diet and have lost nearly 15 lbs, my cholesterol is 90-100, and my blood pressure has dropped. I DO NOT starve myself. I eat until I'm full. And I don't feel disgusting, just full. The protein obsession in this country is ridiculous. If professional (and very muscular) boxers, tri-athletes, and marathon runners can be vegan, then it seems pretty obvious that animal protein is unnecessary.
I have a Ph. D. in cell and molecular biology and have been doing basic science research for 15 years in developmental biology, genetics, and now cancer biology. It never occurred to me until recently, that yes, of course! Plants are made of protein! Ubiquitin! Ribosomes! Microtubules! Histones! Oh my! All plants have complete proteins! That means every single amino acid. Some are just RICHER in specific amino acids. Don't worry about protein. Protein deficiency is nearly impossible. If you want extra proteins, eat more legumes, quinoa, amaranth, etc. There are a lot more options than you think. Did you know that spinach has fat and protein! Wow!
I also don't fear getting sick anymore. You can prevent cancer, heart disease, alzheimer's, and diabetes. Now, we just need to convince the medical establishment and our government to switch our nutrition priorities. We can start by ending corn subsidies! What a waste of money! We're also spending 17% of our GDP on health care, and we aren't getting healthier. We're fat, depressed, stressed-out, cancer ridden, diabetic, and senile from neuro-degenerative disease.

4556371,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Ok the hoopla was tremendous on this DVD so I went ahead and purchased it.  First and foremost there is a lot of detail in the video.  I was very skeptical about this whole idea. But I have to admit... The DVD program doesn't have you doing anything crazy like some diets I won't mention. Kuddo points go to the facts on meats, and dairy.  I suppose one could say that no meat, or less than half of the meat you are use to putting on your plate will not hurt you.  The dairy elimination... Gosh I love my cheese, better than I do milk. But i would not miss either because I don't eat that much.  The only thing that bothers me about the whole deal over dairy, and meats is that vegetarians don't eat meat, and many don't eat dairy. So how do they fair in studies conducted?

The Japanese have enjoyed meals for centuries that did not make meat the staple of their diet.  They eat a lot of veggies, and fruits.  They live longer than anyone on the planet.  When the western food started becoming many of their choices at the dinner table - they noticed a change in health, and many of the ones that had to eat at the mickeyDs their health went completely south. Their weight suffered, heart, stomach, etc.  Just like the Chinese, they suffered.  many dropped the western diet all together, and went back to their old way of eating. This movie did not mention this.  But it did mention China. For which both the Chinese, and Japanese share a lot of the same culture when it comes to food.

What I really wonder about is if anyone has put their child, or themselves on this type of diet because of stomach ailments, ADHD, Autism, etc? I ask because many say it all could be diet related.

When I purchased this DVD I also purchased the book ""The China Study"". Get both. The book goes into more detail, and outlines more on the case study over the decades.

I have to say that since beginning this eating program, I have not only never felt better in my life, but have begun to drop some of the much not needed weight; but moreover, I can positively say that food has never tasted better, and have discovered that such a wonderful variety of fruits and vegetables are so easy to prepare and enjoy.  There are endless possibilities for creativity in recipes and the cravings that I was anticipating for the dairy and sweets have not only never occurred but the cravings have now changed to delightful snacks whenever wanted of the best fruit and tasty vegetables I did not even consider before.

4556381,1,B0053ZHZI2,"Although this movie appears to give a convincing argument that we should not eat any animal products, we should beware that it plays fast and loose with the science.  Drs. Campbell and Esselstyn are sincere in their belief of the plant only diet, and so is the movie, but we must take a critical look at the science.

The first obvious problem is that it conflates ""Western diet"" with eating a lot of meat.  The Western diet also contains a lot of sugar, coffee, chocolate, white flour, and other refined foods.  The movie acknowledges this, but then when it focuses on disease, it talks specifically of animal protein.  We are shown statistics of how modern diseases correlate with the Western diet, and examples of people improving their health following Esselstyn's diet.  But never is ""animal protein"" separated from the other factors as an independent variable.

The movie also acts as if traditional cultures ate very little to no animal foods.  This is patently false.  There is a wide variety of diets in healthy, traditional, non-westernized cultures.  Some consume only a little animal foods, some consume quite a lot, but almost all consume at least some.

The second obvious problem is that it conflates ""casein"" with ""animal protein"" and from their to all animal foods including fish.  The movie (and Campbell) gets the science very mixed up on this.  The reason that Campbell's low-protein rats did not develop liver cancer on the high aflotoxin diet is because there wasn't enough protein to rebuild and maintain their bodies period.  The cancer doesn't stand a chance when everything else is dying around it as well.  Only 12 rats on the low-protein diet, as opposed to 30 on the high-protein diet, survived more than 1 year.  Pause the movie at 16:37 and read this for yourself.  I have Denise Minger to thank for doing the research and pointing all this out.

Next we are given Norway as an example where the reduction in animal foods lead to a clear drop in heart disease.  Indeed the graphs do show a strong correlation, but again, I have Denise Minger to thank for doing the research on this.  It would seem that the drop began before serious livestock restriction began, but after restriction of sugar, coffee, chocolate, flour, etc.  Oops.  Not only that, but it correlates with a heavy increase in fish consumption.  So it would seem you're just as well off, or even better off, to ditch the refined foods and increase fish consumption.  It's too bad the movie doesn't look at fish separately from other animal foods.  It's something of a double standard to say Norwegians got healthy ditching animal foods and say nothing of their heavy increase in fish consumption, then later show UFC champion Mac Danzig as an example that we should remove fish from our diet.

One final thing I want to point out is this movie implies we will have a lower ecological impact eating less meat, or possibly no meat.  As far as conventionally, factory farmed meat is concerned, that is true, but small sustainable farms need animals to complete the ecological cycle.  We do our best to support the long-term ecological sustainability of the planet by both animal and plant products from such farms.  As Denise Minger, Chris Masterjohn, Stephen Guyenet, and others have repeatedly pointed out, there is no evidence animal foods from such sources contribute to any of the modern diseases.

Anyone seriously interested in critically analyzing the science behind this movie should take the time and read Denise Minger's review:

4556385,4,B0053ZHZI2,"There are three quite simple reasons to pursue veggie protein over animal and they are:
(1.) Healthier which few would disagree with.
(2.) Ethically superior because even though we're capable of doing something doesn't mean we have to do it. In this case should an animal other than ourselves also have the right to live - to experience what we do within their limited niche of life.
(3.) Environmentally as we all know it takes a lot of petroleum products to produce, process and transport plant food for animal consumption and in turn it takes a lot of plant protein to make a little animal protein which is wasteful and in the process there is a lot of toxic chemical byproducts. Finally animal waste in large quantities is toxic to soil and surface/aquifer water.

4556391,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I've been on this diet for 10 months.  I was vegetarian for 25 years before but continued to eat eggs, cheese, cook with olive oil, ate some veggies but nothing like I eat now.  I have a 15 oz. green smoothie (kale, chard, collards, dark lettuce and the peels from carrots and yams) every day--at least 6 cups of veggies in a broth which I make from discarded ends, stalks, etc. of other veggies.  I also eat at least one salad a day.

I am almost 70.  I fast-walk/jog for 45 minutes 5x/week.  I have lost 45 pounds - piece of cake, er piece of marinated tofu.  My cholesterol has gone from 213 to 145; my LDL from 112 to 68.  I sleep well and need only 7 hours without a mid-day nap.  My BP has always been good.

I wish I had started this way of eating 25 years ago.

I have speed-read thru the comments and I am thrilled with the numbers people report after being on this diet--and diet does not mean counting calories, weighing food, counting carbs, etc.  Diet of whole food plant based means way of life.

You lose the cravings.  Cheese was the hardest for me.  Without exception, EVERY TIME I have slipped over the last 10 months--and it has only happened 3-4 times--I paid the price.  My stomach, my digestion, my bathroom experience -- I paid the price.  So why would 10 seconds of eating be worth the price of feeling bad for the next 12-24 hours?

When I quit smoking 23 years ago I had cravings for awhile.  Took me 9 years to finally quit but quit I did.  I learned how to get through the cravings for a cigarette without smoking.  Same with cravings for a muffin or a chunk of cheddar.  Eat an organic honey crisp apple and savor the flavor, eat it slowly.  And in time, a few weeks perhaps, the cravings go away.

4556392,2,B0053ZHZI2,"Just saw this and found it overall disappointing. It was clear from the first few minutes that this was to be a pro-vegetarian driven agenda. One of the most overwhelmingly glaring errors of this video is that they spend most of the time talking about heart disease and diet. Somehow, they managed to avoid a discussion about the most dangerous dietary ingredient that has caused our current heart disease epidemic, which is trans fats. Trans fats have been implicated in heart disease and cancer with actual science, not just correlation which seems to be the primary source of ""proof"" for the vegetarian driven agenda in this film. Trans fats have been around since the 1890's, and their usage increased over the years since then. I've noticed that vegetarian activists are like the drivers in hit and run accidents when it comes to trans fats and vegetable oils as they once touted them as replacements for animal fats and butter, with the AMA actually providing literature to doctors instructing them to have patients use margarine in place of butter as it was lower in cholesterol (but full of trans fats). The CSPI (run by vegetarian activists) was the primary driver in forcing fast food restaurants to get rid of animal fats such as beef tallow and to instead switch to vegetable oils that contained trans fats back in the 70's. The fact that this film went out of its way to ignore the overwhelming evidence that exists today regarding trans fats and heart disease is rather telling about how much more interested they are in pursuing a vegetarian activist agenda vs. telling the whole story.

I think it is rather disappointing that a ""documentary"" with doctors that are supposed to be experts in their field fail to even break down the difference between HDL, LDL, and vLDL and the fact that vLDL is the main culprit when it comes to heart disease and that vLDL is not naturally present in animal fats. They also try to forward the false idea that the only reason people should eat meat is for protein by saying that is what people have been told, then interviewing a few people randomly on the street who answer ""protein"" when asked why people should eat meat, then stating that you can get all the protein you need from plants. Basically they presented a false maze of circular logic to check off another reason not to eat meat while ignoring the fact that beef is high in b vitamins, selenium, and zinc. The film also tries to tie higher liver cancer rates in the Phillipines to eating animal products when it is 100% clear that the studies they are showing as ""proof"" of this hypothesis are based on feeding mice high levels of CASEIN, which is a protein found in MILK, not beef, not chicken, not pork, and not fish. But the doctor chooses to forward the premise that all animal proteins are the same as casein because he distinctly avoids discussing the difference between casein protein found in milk vs other sources of animal proteins, making his assertion pure disinformation.

The things I would agree with is that in America, the USDA is corrupt and promotes falsehoods and a bad dietary recommendation plan that they change every 10 years or so. The biggest problem in America is high carbohydrate (thanks to cheap high fructose corn syrup), low nutrient dense foods dominate diets. High fructose corn syrup is in almost everything mostly because it is dirt cheap due to govt subsidies for corn farmers growing genetically modified corn that is used to produce HFCS and also a low grade grain source of cheap calories that is used to fatten up cows for greater yields of beef.

I've been eating a ""whole food"" plant and animal based diet for over a year now. It revolves around eliminating grains and legumes completely, eating way more green and leafy vegetables, some colorful veggies like carrots, squash, sweet potatoes,  moderate amounts of fruits, almonds, walnuts, avocados, coconut, and regular servings of eggs, beef, pork, fish, and chicken. All the meats and eggs come from organic farms that feed their animals their natural diets instead of crappy grain products and also provide room to roam for the animals rather than caging them up in piles of their own fecal matter like the corporate factory farms do.

I've never felt better. I have been a dedicated exercise enthusiast for 15 years now and for the first time in my life I have visible abs AND obliques after dropping 15 pounds of excess bodyfat that I had not been able to lose following a low fat diet that had a high carbohydrate content due to the heavy servings of grains and fruit. I still eat fruit, only I limit it to 2-3  servings per day as that is plenty of carbs once my other veggies are considered. My fat intake is much higher now, yet my blood work profile has improved dramatically. My doctor told me she wished all of her patients could have blood work as good as mine. I don't count calories and I don't track my food intake. I just eat foods that are nutrient dense and satisfying.

All that being said, I have no grudges against anyone who wants to go all out vegetarian. If that is what makes you feel good and you are happy with it, go for it. The most important thing that I think can be agreed on by almost everyone who cares is that a diet loaded with sugar and highly processed foods is terrible for your health. Getting back to foods that are minimally processed and haven't been stuffed full of additives, preservatives, sodium, sugars, horomones and pesticides is the key to dealing with the health issues that are associated with an American diet.",1316822400,31,5571,4.690184049079755

At 18, he got into body-building and, recently at college discovered the ""unlimited meal plan"". In almost all body-building books, claims are made by the experts that the only way for an ectomorph (or any other morph) to build muscle is by way of large consumption of animal flesh. He's young, he's experimenting, and, of course, mom and dad are ""wrong"". I tried to find this DVD at Blockbuster. It is not even due IN at most Blockbuster video rental locations. For a split-second, I was surprised. Then I realized; the masses of asses are not likely to rent this DVD. Not a money-maker. The point: after reading The China Study and then watching this DVD, I literally put down my very ""healthy"" bean and cheese (all organic!) burrito covered in homemade salsa! This DVD drove me right back to the mindset I had at 18----that meat is murder, that the only babies meant to drink cow milk are, well, calves, and that the human body does not need protein every day or in the amounts that the ""man"" tells us it does. I realized, during my viewing of this marvelous DVD, that all of my physicians (yes, I have a TEAM) are obese. I am not. I will be, if I keep ingesting dairy products.

My other minor criticism is that when discussing disease rates in countries and between countries, they needed to emphasize (instead of neglect to mention) that the disease comparisons of numbers and rates took into account age adjusted and population adjusted numbers.  Instead, you have to take their word for it that the data was analyzed correctly (which it was, per review of supporting materials).

4556410,4,B0053ZHZI2,"'Forks over Knives' is a literal must-see film. It is a documentary as revolutionary as Morgan Spurlock's 'Super Size Me', but unfortunately, not presented as well.

The film documents the life work of two extraordinary physicians, Drs. Caldwell Esselstyn and T. Colin Campbell. They have both traveled the world in order to pin down why Americans are so ill with such a rising increase in the incidences of preventable disease. Their results led them to believe that a plant-based, raw food diet is the key to optimal health and wellness.

Now, whether or not you agree with their claims is moot. The fact is that even the USDA as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services both agreed that veganism is associated with far lower rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and loads of other maladies (I can't post the link here, so Google it if you don't believe me). My star comes off because as another viewer pointed out, it was a very dull documentary.

'Super Size Me' was a hit because it was presented so incredibly well (and yes, the subject material was intriguing). This documentary had a few people involved as well as the two doctors and all interviews were very bland. The highlight of the film for me (BESIDES the excellent information) was UFC Champ Mac Danzig and the always fabulous Dr. Neal Barnard.

In order to get peoples' attention, your subject material must grip people! This documentary is supposed to speak to people how to change their lives and avoid disease. I think it needs to be a little more interesting to people who are a little lazy in this area.

This was just reported recently here: [...] There are NO indigeneous vegan cultures anywhere in the world. The only time a culture consumes an entirely plant-based diet is when they do not have access to animal sourced protein. This rarely ever happens as insects are often used in place of larger animals or fish. It's truly sad that the veganistas keep trying to force their pseudo-science, cherry-picked data and misrepresented facts as T. Collin Campbell has in this and the China Study...which incidently has been thoroughly refuted. Food is NOT a religion; it's information for your cells!",1315440000,41,706,4.9411764705882355
4556412,4,B0053ZHZI2,"Some documentaries pose a dilemma. The subject matter is terrific, but the film itself may be just average. I review films. I can state in the review that the importance of the subject matter is second to none! The film is adequate for conveying information, but not unique or inventive in any way. Certainly, viewers will watch average films occasionally and I hope this is one of them. The subject matter is enlightening and may even be life changing.
  Enough of talking around the subject. A while back, I had been on a vegetarian diet for a period seven years. I was not perfect, but I would say less than five percent of animal product got into my diet. Most violations occurred when there were animal products in sauces and cheese sprinkled in salads when I was eating out. In order to adhere to my regimen, I ate most meals at home. For a single man in America in my thirties, vegetarianism required conscious effort. But I did discover that there was a social life in a vegetarian world also. Why would I do it? I had a health issue. Did it seem to help? Yes. Much increased endurance and better sleep were obvious benefits. In fact I never slept better than when I was on this vegetarian diet.
  I have a basis for understanding this documentary. I do agree that there are too many variables that were not controlled in some of the studies mentioned, but not all. The film shows that Dr. Esselstyn treated heart patients with low-fat vegetarian diets with success. The armed services have adopted a low fat diet--another supporting factor. Of course, most sources of fat in our diet are animal. The Norwegian study which reflects the decrease in disease during the NAZI occupation is good corroboration. I first read about this study in the '60's and I am glad to see it referenced here. This is particularly supportive because the NAZI's took all the meat they could find for themselves. Other wartime studies merely showed the benefits of under-eating.
  There is a common belief that eating meat increases strength and aggression -- even today. The endorsement by the sports fighter shows that this is most probably a myth. With the help of blood tests and a doctor's guidance, you can avoid the pitfalls of switching to vegetarianism. You have to balance your nutrition without meat and diary and you may have to be monitored for a while. I have found that the craving for meat is sometimes just a craving for salt. Some people add eggs to their diet for convenience and a quick solution. Cultivating an interest in spices will certainly be rewarding.

4556413,5,B0053ZHZI2,"If you Google the phrase ""More Doctors Smoke Camels Than Any Other Cigarette"" you will find a TV ad from 1949 promoting Camel cigarettes. 1949 was not so long ago and everyone thought cigarettes were ok. My Grandmother smoked until she found out later in life they were unhealthy. Unfortunately she was not privileged to the information in this excellent documentary. She had a quadruple bypass surgery and suffered a stroke during the operation. She was never the same after and she died several years later of another stroke. I never met my Grandfather - he died when he was 48 years old from a heart attack. According to this documentary 1 in 4 heart problems end in sudden death. My Grandparents were the type of people that would have happily change their eating habits if they knew it would benefit them.

Every minute someone dies of heat disease. It is so sad to think of all the families permanently scared from these tragedies. The worst part is this disease is completely preventable as many other degenerative diseases are.

We are now living through that interim stage when not everyone knows that eating unhealthy literally kills you. Nobody debates that cigarettes kill. Many people do not smoke today because it's so clear that cigarettes kill. It is awful reality that so many people today do not realize they are slowly killing themselves with diet.

My motivation for changing my diet was the boost in energy I received. It was refreshing to hear that so many others experienced this similar boost in energy. I'm also happy to know that I will be heart attack proofing myself as well. Just because I have heart disease in my family doesn't mean I'm doomed to get it. In fact the only reason it runs in my family is because my family ate the same foods.

Dr. Campbell co-wrote the fanstastic book, ""The China Study,"" which is part autobiography and part summary of scientific research.

Former President Bill Clinton has indicated that both Campbell and Esselstyn influenced him as he attempts to reverse his heart disease with plant based nutrition.

4556417,4,B0053ZHZI2,"Firstly I applaud Lee Fulkerson for bringing to the screen the works of Drs Caldwell, Esselstyn and others.  I have been following Dr Esselstyn's approach for a while now, as set out in his book Prevent & Reverse Heart Disease. I have seen some fantastic results: weight loss, significantly reduced cholesterol levels and so on. I went on to read The China Study (Dr Campbell), and have also read the works of Dr Dean Ornish - another giant in this field, and others. I believe there is powerful information in all of these works, and, based on my personal results and circumstances, believe that plant-based nutrition is the way to go. I am enjoying a healthy lifestyle and hope that family and friends soon come to see this as the healthier alternative.

So I am happy that at last the life work of these eminent doctors has been made more accessible and available through the medium of film, but on the other hand I feel the movie was a missed opportunity. By that I mean the movie might have been better tailored to suit more mainstream audiences - the narrative made punchier, the key points called out and illuminated more, and the overall message made more powerful through the use of film  as the medium. There were times when some staggering information was presented in a very understated way, perhaps intentionally so as not to appear overly biased or evangelistic.  But in being understated I feel some impact will be lost on mainstream audiences, and I think the proceedings could have, on the whole, been more compelling.

I am perhaps being a little harsh. On the positive side, it was great to see footage of Drs Esselstyn, Campbell, McDougall, Barnard and others - including Rip Esselstyn, Dr Caldwell Esselstyn's son and author of the Engine 2 diet. (As a sidebar, I am not sure why Dr Ornish wasn't included in the film).

Of course, there will also be the comparisons and comments about the documentary's style of influencing by editing or selective information gathering. Certain others will call the science or the research findings quackery.

Okay. It's a documentary. It has a bent. Almost every scientific study can be questioned based on the goal and mindset of the researchers. But when I watch a documentary I try to keep in mind that I'm not necessarily watching pure truth, but interpretation of truth.

Here is something else to consider. How much of our time is spent filtering through marketing propaganda? We know that color influences hunger. Hence the yellows, reds, oranges and browns in many restaurants and chains. We also have experienced sudden and intense hunger when seeing photographs or television commercials for food. (And we also know that there is an industry that creates food art for those fabulous pictures out of products that we would not put in our mouths.)

Within the last decade or so, ads for medications to ""manage"" our diseases have flooded our media.

Pick your propaganda...and pick your poison.

Here is why I'm recommending that you watch this film if you have any qualms about your health. If you want to know the truth, if you want to be healthy, if you are concerned about the health of your family, watch this film so that the propaganda you hear and see and smell everyday can at least have a counterpoint to consider.

This documentary shares several stories that are almost jaw-dropping amazing. Men and women who stop disease, reverse horrible lab work results and add life to their lives by simply giving up animal products. The reason that these people make the decision to follow this radical path is based on research and the results of others.

Here is my series of reasons that I believe and embrace what I saw in this film.

I work in the medical field. I see people everyday who routinely take ten to twenty different medications to keep on top of their diseases. Each medication has side-effects and many of those need additional medication to keep symptoms under control.

Often, our healthiest patients are the upper eighty-year-olds and even ninety-somethings who grew up on farms and still eat from their homegrown gardens. The middle age folks, the ones who work hard, run to and fro, and often rely on fast food, restaurants and convenience food at home, well, some of them appear to be some of the sickest folks we see. Of course, this is my unofficial and unscientific observation. But, honestly, there are some alarming new studies that confirm my concerns.

On a personal note. My husband has rheumatoid arthritis. Four years ago, based on the progression of his disease to the need for injectibles, we made big changes from the traditional current American diet to organic and whole food as much as possible. Immediately we saw results. He was able to hold off the progression of his disease and even drop a medication for break through pain. In April of this year we took that mindset to a new level. We went Vegan (Whole-food, plant-based). My husband's knuckles look normal. He doesn't have flare-ups of pain like he did four years ago. I have energy I haven't felt in years. My skin glows, I feel healthier than I did at thirty. I've lost a total of 45 lbs in four years.

In March I mourned that I would have to give up cheese, eggs and cream in my coffee. In September I'm saying I don't even miss any of those.

There is a difference between Vegan and whole-food, plant-based eating. And it can be an ethical choice verses a nutritional one. Vegan can include highly processed food that is not recommended by any health professional. Whole-food, plant-based is eating like most healthcare providers suggest. More leafy greens, reds, purples, yellows and oranges to join the green, avoidance of animal high fat products like cheeses. This advice doesn't go much beyond the usual medical advice to eat a healthy diet.

The propaganda you embrace will come with choices and consequences.",1314835200,58,4148,4.840395480225989
4556421,2,B0053ZHZI2,"I saw this movie because I am interested in leading a healthier lifestyle.

The film posits several scientific studies/examples which purport to show that veganism is the correct diet/lifestyle choice.

One example intrigued me.  Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, one of the main subjects of the film, furnished a graph depicting a dramatic decrease in deaths from heart-related diseases in Norway during World War II.  On the graph, the drop-off during the war was astounding.  Before the war, the rate of circulatory-based deaths was increasing.  During the war, it dropped sharply.  After the war, it went back up again.  Clearly, it seemed, some factor was at work during the war.

The narrator of the movie posits that this is attributable to Nazi confiscation of domesticated animals during the occupation of Norway:

""In World War II the Germans occupied Norway.  Among the first things they did was confiscate all the livestock and farm animals to provide supplies for their own troops.  So the Norwegians were forced to eat mainly plant-based foods.""

After some commentary, Dr. Esselstyn subsequently states:

""With the cessation of hostilities in 1945, back comes the meat, back comes the dairy, back comes the strokes and heart attacks.  Such an absolute powerful lesson, but, we didn't get it.""

I thought this was amazing and decided to research it.

Unfortunately, however, I came to find that this historical depiction is not accurate.

The graph used in the movie was reproduced from an article in the ""Lancet"" medical journal.  ""Mortality from Circulatory Diseases in Norway 1940-1945.""  By Dr. Axel Strom and Dr. R. Adelsten Jensen, published in 1951.  This is not a scientific study--its contents are not open to varying interpretations.  It is a 4-page historical survey of diet during the war years in Norway.  The article cites a more detailed study published by Dr. Strom in 1948:  ""Examination Into the Diet of Norwegian Families During the War-Years 1942-45.""  It is in a supplement of ""Acta Medica Scandinavia.""

While red meat consumption decreased (due to rationing--I personally could not find evidence of Nazi confiscation, although, I did not research this heavily)--the consumption of fish increased significantly during the war.

Long story short, fish consumption nearly tripled among Norwegians during the war (Norwegian sardines are famous--and fish cannot be confiscated).

Consumption of herring, mackerel, and small, oily fish increased from an average of 99 to 292g per day.  ""The highest value ever found by any dietary investigation in Norway,"" Strom notes.

At the same time, the fat intake among working families decreased from an average of 159 to 71g per day.  Daily caloric intake was also reduced from 3,470 calories per man in 1937-38 to 2,850 calories 1942-45.

Strom's 1948 study goes on to state, ""Consumption of milk of all sorts averaged 404 grs. per man value per day.""  And subsequently, ""The average daily consumption of butcher's meal was 32.3 grs. per man value.""

Clearly, Norwegians had access to ample fish, rationed quantities of red meat, and moderate supplies of milk.  None of these facts are congruent with how this historical situation was articulated in the film.

I am not a scientist, I just want to lead a healthier lifestyle.  Many of the examples adduced in the movie as proofs for veganism I am unable to vet for myself.  However, I am able to understand this example.  The use of this example in the movie is either based upon intentional falsehood, or simplistic oversight.  Simply, Norwegians weren't eating ""mainly plant-based foods.""

Moreover, the journal articles are not very robust, they are not scientific studies.  I am not sure they can inform us at all about healthy eating--perhaps during WWII Norwegians walked more and smoked less.  The articles are historically interesting, but they're not really on-par with today's scientific studies.

Because of this, I feel I am unable to trust other things in this movie (the studies I am unable to evaluate), and from other research, have decided to not be a vegan.  If such a simple, straight-forward journal article could be misunderstood, misconstrued, or obfuscated, it would be much easier to misrepresent the other examples in the movie which rely on a firmer understanding of science.  The use of this Norwegian example demonstrates either extreme deficiency in research ability (it is a straight-forward, 4-page article, after all), or intentional falsehood.  Neither of which are factors which engender credibility in any research field, which requires intellectual rigor and honesty.

However, I am happy to have gone through this process of studying nutrition.  ""Forks Over Knives"" spurred me to do that.  It also taught me a lot about truth, honesty, and the nature of humanity.  Because of the lessons learned in the course of my research, I have come to more fully respect and value the truth.  I endeavor to always be intellectually honest, admit when I do not know something or where there are nuances in what the truth is, and never compromise in communicating just the truth.  I do not want to waste my life by lying--against myself, against the truth, and especially to others, when their health, well-being, and conception of the truth is at stake.

I hope this benefits others.",1314835200,116,5322,5.141025641025641

Many of our friends and family thought our action too extreme. That's their call.

These eminent researchers, one a heralded clinician, the other an internationally acclaimed nutritional expert, have long reviewed the history of how the American diet which is heavily animal food based has caused skyrocketing rates of various disease including heart, breast cancer, et.  They have observed first hand how those who favor animal dominated diets compare to those people who mainly consumre plant based foods. The facts prove that the latter can not only lower the risk of disease, but actually retard such diseases as heart, prostate, liver, etc.

If ever you should see a film, this is the one.

Our temptation is to buy multiple copies of this eye opening film and send them to friends and family. However, our experience in trying to tell people of this work has lead us to believe that most people are too engrained in the long standing American diet mythology to be willing to change.

This American overconsumption of meat, poultry,  eggs, and, yes, suger is actively  purveyed by the commercial animal food producers, fast food chains, MDs with their expensive invasive specialties, and the big Pharmas with their drugs which sell in the billions.  For example, the drug companies spend over $50 billion a year to tell you about how drugs can help various conditions, which can be greatly avoided by proper plant based diets.

Moreover, our Federal government through the Dept of Agriculture and even the National Academy of Sciences often powerfully abets these myths, saying that good health requires the present diet, one which results in 600,000 Americans dying of heart disease every year.

The science presented in this film is overwhelmingly clear, but the producer's use of individual patients' dramatically improved health case histories make viewing even more compelling.

He found the film compelling, but wasn't ""ready"" to take the steps for a couple of months.  Well, he started a 28-day challenge on August 1 and so far has lost 23 lbs!  He now calls himself a vegan and has started a website/blog called jonnyogoesvegan.com to document his journey.  I keep pinching myself that he is so committed but he feels so great, he doesn't want to stop!  Thank you Forks Over Knives for saving my husband's life!",1314748800,4,586,4.37962962962963
4556431,5,B0053ZHZI2,"Received my DVD and watched it last night. I had already read the books by Drs. Campbell and Essylstein BUT it was nothing like the impact of the movie seeing the facts and figures on the screen. My husband said ""seal the deal, I'm in""....he had been almost there, but felt a little bit of cheese or milk once in a while was ok, or a little bit of processed snack couldn't hurt! No turning back...he's in!
A little history, after having what was termed digestive disorder, ct scan ruled out worse possibilities, I considered gluten might be a problem, in January eliminated it from my diet. Much better, but not 100%.  We had eliminated a lot of meat, my husband has gout, so red meat in particular was verboten....but we still weren't there.
Preordered the DVD, which arrived yesterday, on release date (THANK YOU Amazon, you are wonderful).  But just prior to that I had downloaded Fat, Sick...Nearly Dead....so I elected to do the juicing, supplemented with green smoothies, no meat.  Husband liked the juices/smoothies, but still had his once in a while sips of milk, bits of cheese, and his favorite snack, highly processed crackers, think Ritz.
Then we watched the movie FOK.  That was it! No more trying to explain what I had read in the China Study, nor the Reversing Heart Disease.  In just 90 minutes of movie, my husband finally grasped what I had been trying to tell him since the first of the year!
Thanks you Doctors, Amazon and the many researchers and individuals without whom this information would never have been brought to the public's attention!",1314748800,7,1566,4.721611721611722
4556432,5,B0053ZHZI2,"This movie contains information that could save your life. In October 2009, at age 52, while running a mile around my neighborhood as I did every morning, I staggered a couple of steps and hit the ground unconscious in full cardiac arrest. Heart disease is the leading killer in this country (needlessly as this movie shows) and the most common type of heart attack is the one like mine that comes with no warning. Survival for cardiac arrest outside the hospital is about 3%. I was extremely lucky - you might not be.

After my heart attack, my doctors said nothing to me about diet. In fact, later after learning about the work of Campbell and Esselstyn (featured in this movie), I asked my doctor how much time they spent in medical school learning the relationship between nutrition and health. His answer - none! If you see this movie, you will know more about the affect of nutrition on health than my doctor, and perhaps more than your doctor too. See this movie.

I applaud everyone involved in making this movie. It is based on scientific research, yet made understandable to all of us, with personal stories included that make it easy to relate. I saw this movie in the theater. I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can give copies to all my family, friends, and all the others in my life that I don't want to suddenly die needlessly.

By the way, after a year and a half of adhering to the advice of Esslestyn, Campbell, McDougall, and others, I've eliminated my heart medications including the damaging statins, while still reducing my total cholesterol level to 160. I've lost weight, my blood sugar is down, my blood pressure is good, and I'm able to run two miles every day. My only remaining health issue is the stents that the doctors put in my cardiac arteries under the belief that they would lengthen my life. Unfortunately, stents, which cannot be removed, have a significant ongoing death rate associated with them that cannot be fixed through nutrition. So I urge you to see this movie, and clean up your eating habits BEFORE a major blow puts you on a pathway to death that you cannot alter.",1314576000,471,2120,4.573684210526316
4556433,5,B0053ZHZI2,"As soon as I was aware of this DVD,  I ordered it and have already watched it twice.  It was so well-done and informative. I have read The China Study and books by Drs. Esselstyn, Ornish, MacDougle and others.

  Anyway, this morning I went to my food co-op for the first time since May (because we were out of the country for the summer).  In just a matter of 4 months, the food co-op had grown so much!  The parking lot was full of cars and people.  Instead of a van delivering the organic, local produce, there was a big truck and trailer.  This is just a small sign that this whole foods, plant based diet is rapidly growing.

I just read that Whole Foods is starting a Wellness Club that teaches members how to shop and cook using a whole foods, plant based diet.  About a year ago, Bill Clinton adopted this diet and his interviews touting the benefits are all over You Tube.  I have never trusted the meat and dairy industries, nor the USDA and their bogus pyramids.  This is the real deal and it's not just for kooks anymore.",1314403200,21,1033,4.290155440414508
4556434,5,B0053ZHZI2,"I have been writing about diets and eating habits a lot lately.  I did a low vegetarian diet, and vegan diet for years, but, the amount of misinformation, stupidity, and poor judgment on my part, caused me to lose more muscle than I would've liked, and less fat, even though I lost a total of eighty pounds.  I am down to the weight that I was in High School right now, the problem is that I was massively obese in High School as well, and still have about 70 to 80 pounds to go.  I stopped believing in diets years ago and began believing in proper eating habits and the past few years has been my research into what works and what doesn't.

Before I praise this film, which took me forever to track down when I heard about it, but eventually found a showing of, and enjoyed greatly, I will give my criticism.  Meat is not bad for you, there is enough science and research out there that a high protein/high fat diet, can have wonderful health benefits, the problem is that especially in America most of the meat is bad. All my research into high fat/high protein diets have shown that there is little evidence to support the attacks on meat and dairy.  There are several villages in Africa and Asia with diets that subsist on solely fat and dairy and live long and healthy lives... though, with the Masai being the constantly referenced tribe, it should be recognized that such groups have probably built and endurance, and drinking raw cow blood for several generations would probably lead to a different metabolism.

Now, the praise.  The larger majority of healthy people are eating whole food plant based diets.  For all the High Protein, High Fat information, the majority of people who live long, healthy lives, do so with a High Nutrient based diet of plant based foods.  Utilizing plant protein--for which many in the High fat, high protein have criticized, with only minor evidence to such accusations, and none that have gone through any big research--is just as effective as animal protein, and in fact, goes to the muscles and body.

This film illustrates that what you eat is a lot more important than what pills the doctors come up with next.  On my journey to health, I've met people like Dick Gregory who swear by a vegan diet, and cured his cancer wit it, for which the doctor gave him six months if he was lucky.  I've met people who have been told that they will be dead in months or years, and have been alive for more than a decade.  These results have not come from a high fat, high protein diet but from a plant based diet, all the time.  And this documentary beautifully details people whose lives have been changed by doing just that type of diet.

The documentary is entertaining, insightful, wonderful, and superbly illustrating one of the best ways to have wonderful energy, great health, and a longer life.

America is stuck in a world of its own, where it believes they can die tomorrow, never asking the real question.  ""What if you live?""  The fact is that most people aren't going to die tomorrow, and the fatalism of religion, for which people believe that God will take them when it's time, is creating a society of people who don't want to do anything, don't want to take care of themselve , and it's scary.

What's sad is that this film will most likely just talk to the converted.  And what might be even worse is that it will talk to the pompous and the arrogant, those vegans who believe they're holier than thou, and that animals are people to.  This message needs to be carried by the level headed, because it's a level headed message.  It's not about animal rights.  It's about people's health, this film shows that, and makes that point wonderfully.  It's not about being one with earth.  It's about listening to one's body, of what it needs to be healthy and function.  This film illustrated why a whole food plant based diet is the way the body does that.

I worry that people will ruin the message, as so many vegan and vegetarian extremist do, preaching from what can only be shere ignorance.  Things like, protein is not necessary--a message that ruined my muscles--when in fact, they should be talking up Spirulina, nuts, beans, and more as a form of natural protein that the body processes quickly and utilizes just as effectively as animal protein.

This documentary is wonderful.  It is clear, succinct, and to the point, and just shows the wonderful power of the food of the earth.

I also recommend, Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead.  It's a wonderful film.  Absolutely brilliant.

I've been promoting a fat based diet, and have had good results with it.  But, I still feel that a whole food plant based diet may be best.",1314144000,4,4672,4.566626650660264
4556435,1,B0053ZHZI2,"Watched a half-hour preview of this documentary today. The presentation style is outdated and the whole thing just felt slow and like something out of the 70s. Then I was jolted by the bad science presented when the narrator announced that cholesterol is bad for you as it lines up your arteries and clogs them. This is oversimplification at best...there is a lot more to it than that, especially after you've seen the Fat Head documentary by Tom Naughton and read ""Why we get fat and what to do about it"" by Gary Taubes as I have..
And then it struck me..well of COURSE they have to lay the blame on cholesterol since only animal products have cholesterol and this documentary is basically about propogating plant nutriton!! I have nothing against eating healthy vegetables,it just  upsets me when people have to blame animal products for harmful effects. It should be about avoiding processed food whether sourced from plants or animals.

4556438,5,B0053ZHZI2,"There has been a plant-based diet movement for sometime now, and though I have read a number of books relating to that (Like Omnivore's Dilemma and Eating Animals) I was truly surprised that i had missed the China Study (which this film is based on). I had the opportunity to catch a screening with a friend late last spring and was truly blown away by the depth of true research that Campbell and the rest of the team had done. His work is on a level that is revolutionary, but at the same time it's not really radical when you think about it.
Eat what nature had intended us to, period.
I love the fact that this is not a fad diet, nor something that you have to buy the author's own brand of food, etc. And it's not about how you cook. It's simply avoiding eating things that are known to be harmful to you. And it's presented in a marvelous way.
What I'm about to present will never happen - but I wish it would: Make this required viewing for every high school student in the US. Our healthcare system would be dramatically less burdened inside one generation and people would be living more happily and less worried about their health.
I cannot praise this movie enough. I hope that it clicks with all of those people out there who wanted to read The China Study and chose not to, it could do them and all of us so much good.",1312070400,13,1331,4.264822134387352

I have now decided to change the way I eat for the rest of my life and when and if I have kids I hope to raise them with this same mindset.  EAT TO LIVE!!!  Forks Over Knives is an amazing movie that really explains why we need to cut out our SAD (standard American diet)diet! I hope this changes lives like it did mine.

What is every meal based around? Meat. I'm 27 now, growing up that's just the way it was, drink your Milk with every meal and most every meal was centralized around some meat.

This film helped to change my thinking. Now I didn't go out and become a vegan after watching it but realized that it's all about the percentages. They mentioned the 20% compared to 5% animal based proteins and how that affected lab mice. I think some meat is alright, as well as some dairy but too much is a recipe for bad health. Life is all about finding that balance.

If you take nothing else from watching this film know that:
1) if your not trying to actively eat healthy your eating unhealthy

Our whole culture has contributed to the impending health care crisis addressed by this film, and I'm convinced that we're being offered the only viable way out.
