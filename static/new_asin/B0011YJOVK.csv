The production is not my favorite (I prefer classical production) but the singers are good.",1377475200,3,165,5.64
8242933,5,B0011YJOVK,"First of all, i like the operas mostly with the ambiance they were created,after all the composer and librettist are the owners of this art. But I know that there are operas that allow to be adapted and are very good or excellent,as in this case. The change at the 1900s, do not distract the real thing:the drama,because it is well done,something austere ,but in good taste. Then we have the performing,that in my opinion is very good to excellent, with the soprano Darina Takova being a revelation to me,it remind me at first of Renata Scotto Met DVD 1979 Luisa Miller, but Takova has a sweeter tone to my ears,while Scotto is more dramatic,but to the end is the same thing:both perform marvelously,Giuseppe Sabattini, Alexander Vinogradov and Ursula Ferri very good from the beginning. The bass Koutchunian and the baritone Salerno take a little time to warm their voice,above all Salerno,but when the opera advances get better. At first, I liked more vocally and visually, the Scotto,Milnes,Domingo of 1979,the standard in my opinion of this jewel,but seeing this version a second time i found that even today with the depleted states of singers,there are excellent versions,even when the stage director changes the scenery and time period. This way you have to do adaptations,PRESERVING THE IMPORTANCE IN WHAT IT HAS TO BE:THE DRAMA.My hat off to Teatro La Fenice,and to Maestro Benini for his conducting. At good last an adaptation that can be proud when compared with the original. I am not saying that it is the only one,only it is the first one i have seen. Bravo",1306713600,8,1571,4.865671641791045
8242934,4,B0011YJOVK,"Memorable stuff. The theme is grim, the composer has it exactly right; just the sort of family circumstances that soaps try to show but do little to make credible.  Poor Luisa, she is doomed and Verdi leads us nicely to its terrible denuemment.  The music and italian poetry is magical in combination. Bullying father dominating in every way the community he dominates, only realizing his own sullen destruction shock horror, after his son and betrothed die in front of him!",1301616000,2,474,4.9125
