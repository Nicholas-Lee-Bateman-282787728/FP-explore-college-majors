1981356,4,B000199JKC,"When I first heard of this DVD coming out I was really excited because the greatest era of modern wrestling was going to be relived.  I was pleased with the way it was presented, the documentary-style production presented both sides of the story in a very fair way.  But many unforgettable moments were either left off of or shown briefly, and for hardcore fans like me it left something missing.
About the extras, I have to agree with one review I read, stating that of all the great matches on Raw, they chose a tag match, but was very pleased with the inclusion of the Flair & Horsemen comeback at Nitro, which to this day still gives me goosebumps.
I recommend the DVD to anyone new to wrestling because that era layed the groundwork for what wrestling is today, however for us old fans it revives a lot of memories, but leaves some of the best ones out.
Hopefully WWE will produce separate documentary-stylye DVD's chronicalling the evolution of both RAW and NITRO.",1076630400,,970,4.601156069364162
1981357,5,B000199JKC,"This is a great DVD. It offers a complete different view at the shows you possibly watched and loved for years. The fights that went on in the back, what really made the progrms go tick and the reality behind the business. When you finish watching this DVD you will look at wrestling programs in a whole new perspective. And if the actual movie doesn't satisfy you can always go to the EXTRAS options and watch famous clips from both WCW NITRO and WWF or WWE RAW.",1076630400,,463,4.333333333333333
1981358,3,B000199JKC,"I must say i am very dissapointed after watching this dvd. this dvd doesn't go in-depth into the wwf and wcw. almost half of the dvd is comments made by Bischoff, Mcmahon and a few other superstars like Mick Foley,Jericho, Benoit etc. The 4 extra matches were really dissapointing. The other half of the dvd features Austin. Jim Ross mentions the Undertaker for only about a minute and he is never  mentioned any more after that. Which is really sad because the Undertaker basically is the WWE.Another bad thing is that the matches don't have the entrance music. I have been watching WWE for about 15 years so I know a good WWE dvd when I see one and this isn't it.
If you really want your money's worth and also want to relive precious memories of the WWF/WCW days then I suggest You buy ""NWO: Back in Black"". IT is quite possibly the best dvd the WWE came up with.",1076544000,,866,4.37888198757764
1981359,4,B000199JKC,"The Monday Night War is probably one of the best DVDs to come from the video vaults of WWE.  A good documentary coupled with good extras makes this a DVD worth owning.  The documentary, which is surpringly even-handed, tells of the phoenix-like rise of WCW from a second-rate promotion that was just a ratings booster for TBS to a juggernaut that almost put WWE out of business.  Interviews with Eric Bischoff, Ric Flair, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio and other former WCW performers chronicle the attiude and handling of the company at the time, while Vince Mcmahon shares his reactions to the tactics used by WCW at the time. The documentary is lacking in some areas--I would have liked to see more on the background and origins for both companies--it would have been nice for fans who are just getting interested in pro wrestling.  Another annoying gripe--while most interviewees are candid and impartial, Gerald Brisco comes across like a whiny suck-up to Vince Mcmahon.
The extras are probably the most lacking part of the DVD--the matches have the wrestler intros cut off,which probably takes away any backstory that may have been filled in by the announcers and the matches--especially the Goldberg/Hogan match --cut away after the pinfall,which again takes away from the matches and the stories they tell.
Despite these misgivings, this DVD is well worth it for new fans and those who want to relive the NWO, Rick Rude appearing on Raw and Nitro on the same night, and the glory days of D-Generation X and the night they ""invaded"" WCW",1076544000,2,1540,4.888888888888889
1981360,5,B000199JKC,"I was actually dreading watching this DVD because I imagined that it was going to become a complete anti-WCW disc.  However, I was gladly proven wrong.  Eric Bischoff and Gene Okerlund do an excellent job defending WCW and are more so honest than not.  The extras are fun to watch and I really think that this is the best DVD that the WWE has ever released.  It would have been better if they would have included comments from more of the stars and maybe had an additional disc that was full of extras, but oh well, it's a very good DVD and if you were a fan of WCW or WWF during the Monday Night Wars than you definitely need to see this DVD.",1076544000,,643,4.161290322580645
1981361,5,B000199JKC,"I did not start watching wrestling until 1999, which was when the WWF was taking a ratings lead that they would never give up.  THis video gave me a great history lesson on what i missed.  This video shows how Nitro and Raw came about.  Then shows how Bischoff brought the WCW out of the south.  It show how WCW took the lead (Buying old WWF superstar+Bash at the Beach 96+the great cruiserweights).  Slowly the WWF came back by making new stars that started to bloom in 1997-98 (HHH, Rock, Austin).  This opposite lead to the downfall of the WCW.  No one could get past Hogan, Nash, Hall.  They also state how the WCW only devolped one wrestler, Goldberg.  The part about Ric Flair really touched me.  How could such a great person be treated like that.  Anyway, i will not give it all away, but  it is one of the top 5 WWE/F home videos i have ever seen.  My list goes like this
1-From the Vault-Shawn Michaels
2-Mick Foley-Greats Hits and Misses
3-Monday Night War
4-Ultimate Ric Flair
5-TLC
The WWE has released great videos lately.  Buy this now.
PS-The clips sprinkled through out the movie are spot on.
PSS-The extras are not great, but they are good enough.  I would have still payed for the DVD even if there were not extras.",1076544000,,1234,4.4222222222222225
1981362,3,B000199JKC,"This is a good highlight DVD for the Monday Night War.
However, like the previous reviewer, I agree that the matches should not have been cut like they were.  If you want a GREAT supplement to this video, order the nWo video, that is a classic one and will give even more detailed history of the Monday Night War.  The only part of this video that I did not really like was Jim Ross' mouth being attached to Vince MacMahon's [behind] the entire time he is giving information.  If you can cut Ross' comments, this would give this a four star review.  But it does lose two stars for those commments and the fact that it seems like it was RUSHED into production, perhaps why they cut out intros and reactions in the 'complete matches' of the EXTRAS.
Overall, a good documentary.",1076457600,,775,4.436619718309859

1981395,3,B000199JKC,"When you win the war you get to write the history............
It seems to me that the former WWF dropped the ball on what Could've been an amazing look at what brought pro wrestling back to the masses I'm talking about the Monday Night War.
A lot of key elements were overlooked/ complete erased  At times it feels like a shoot other times it's very scripted Vince doesn't seem to say much and what he does say seems very off-center. The WWE was the WWF at that time why couldn't everyone just call it the WWF when RAW was brought up??? But, paying to use the WWF copyright isn't in the best interest of the WWE

What they should've done to please all the fans

Release this as a box set The Monday Night War The 1st Year (1994-1995) have the 1st year of both Raw & Nitro on as many dvd's they needed. They don't have to put the whole 2hr/1hr show just the amazing and sometimes crazy events that happened in and around both companies with before and after interviews (shoots) & segments talking about each show
That would've been a very smart marketing device for the WWE
But, as always, Vince and his yes men  can't give the fans what they really want..

My biggest problem with this dvd is nothings is said about the following things:

1. The Brian Pillman/Steve Austin gun angle (This was so crazy and seemed so real why not talk about this) Stuff like this were the building blocks to what would become the attitude era
R.I.P. Brian Pillman
2. Using the ECW to try to lure fans away from Nitro I'm talking about ECW Is Raw the night ECW came to the aid of The WWF and showcased a Number of ECW Stars (Tommy Dreamer, The Dudelyz, Big Stevie Cool, Raven and Many More) Hearing the Chants of ""ECW"" ECW"" on RAW with a lot of the crowd being legit  ECW fans is a site to see and here They plugged their 1st PPV But, in the end ECW was burned in the process!
Around this time Vince already owned a huge portion of ECW (why else would he allow a indie company that was beneath him get spotlighted on his program?)
3. Introducing RVD as Mr. Monday Night (while he was still with ECW)
4. The NWA Angle where a few of the wrestlers from NWA were introduced and wrestled on Raw  good idea to bad they gave up on it
5. Bret Hart turning heal and reforming The new hart foundation
6. Cactus Jack &  Terry Funk being introduced into the WWE,
7.. Tammy ""Sunny"" Sytch Being the 1st true modern  WWF diva!
8. The sad and very unnecessary Raw after the death of Owen Hart
(The fact that not one word is said about the memory of Owen Hart on this dvd is so heartbreaking and in poor taste)
9. Jeff Jarrett working a WWE PPV  dropping the IC belt to Chyna  the next night showing up on Nitro!
10.  Raven joined WCW
11. Todd Gordon trying to bring the whole ECW roster to Nitro! (This should've been brought up it's a rumor that's been around almost 20 years)
12. WCW creating a hardcore title (trying to mimic ECW)
13. WWF creating a hardcore title (trying to mimic ECW)
14. The British Bulldog Being the 1st Person to win and Hold The WWF European Title (R.I.P. Davey Boy Smith)
15. Turning Sting into a ""Crow"" type character,
16. The Nitro Girls (Maybe not a massive deal now but, they were big enough to get there own PPV and spread in Penthouse Magazine) Sorry it was a tame none nude Sports Illustrated style pics
17. Tylene Buck being Introduced as a WCW valet (Prior to her WCW gig she was doing late night tv adds for Backyard Wrestling)
18. Bret Hart's 1st  shoot style interview in WCW! (After the infamous  screw job) Way to go Vince!
19. Both WWE & WCW signing a number of former ECW stars,
20. ICP making appearances on both RAW & Nitro
21. WWF bringing in the fake Diesel and Razor Ramon
22. The Death of so many of the stars in both promotions

These are just some of the things this dvd left out along with a laundry list of things

There are some cool things on this dvd that happened during this incredible  fight for the top spot in pro wrestling
But when everything is said and done you feel like you missed a lot of the great things that were etched in every fans mind during this time are sadly left out!

Shame on the WWE trying to pass this off as the true story about what was going on behind the scenes in both the WCW and WWE
This is just a biest point of view from the company that won the war but, lost a huge amount of the viewers in the process
It goes to show you without real competition the WWE has just sucked  7.5/10",1451865600,,4437,4.209905660377358

1981399,5,B000199JKC,"In the video, Vince McMahon is complaining that WCW almost put them out of business and Jerry Brisco, said that their jobs were at stake. Funny how they never mention that they did the same exact thing to the AWA, put them out of business and I'm sure Vince didn't lose any sleep over it. In my opinion, Vince took a look at the AWA, and said ""I want that"" and he got it. Vince actually had Hulk Hogan before the AWA did and he got rid of him because he didn't know what to do with him. Verne Gagne made him a huge star and then Vince decided he wanted him back and then all the big names from the AWA followed in Hogan's footsteps.",1438560000,,632,4.023809523809524

1981404,2,B000199JKC,"For 2004 and a time where WWE's DVD's still didn't go too far in breaking kayfabe and going far into detail, this is an ok dvd with an absolute WATERED DOWN story as to what took place during the greatest era in pro wrestling history (95-01).  The reality is though, looking back now especially, this was just another way for Vince and WWE to brag about their victory and showcase what was so good about their own product.  The documentary gets comical at some points, basically stopping at some point in 1997 for WCW and then legit showing full segments of things that took place in WWE in 98 and on.  They mention Goldberg for about 12 seconds and then before you know it they talk about how WCW fell apart and that was that.  Want an in depth story of almost EVERYTHING about the ""Monday Night War""?  Check out the 20 episode WWE Network series.

1981471,5,B000199JKC,"Relive all the action on this kinda short but very exciting movie from  wwe home videos. I was contemplating this purchase for several months but luckily I decided to get it from here on Amazon. I paid right around 6 bucks including shipping and that's decent, but a few months earlier Walmart had it n the 5 buck box. Always, the movie is full of great superstars that fought their way through an era that brought millions of Americans together each and every Monday night. Either it being a live Monday nitro where Eric Bischoff would give away the results of the mostly taped Raw is War, or the fake macho man and Hulk Hogan being idiots on Raw, it was a heated battle all the way to the end of an era n 2001.
Raw premiered in 93 as a weekly taped show on USA network on Monday nights showcasing there best athletes from Shawn Michaels to Undertaker. It instantly grew a crowd of followers enough so that in under two years WCW's chairman Eric Bischoff decided to follow suit and start his very own show on the same night @the same time. What ended up happening was a War of epic proportions, The Monday night War.
  Some instant classic memory's that this DVD showcases includes Lex Luger fighting in a Championship match @WrestleMania 10, then a few days later the lex express shows up on The very 1st episode of WCW's Monday Nitro live from Mall America on the superstation TBS. This had many fans jumping ship from Raw to Nitro over night, thus starting the war to-be.
  Probably the meanest tactics ever used on TV, WCW did what ever possible to beat out McMahons WWE, including having WWE's Womens Champion show up on their telecast with the title in hand & throwing it into the garbage like a piece of trash. But the main thing that escalated this dual began one Monday night when another WWE wrestler by the ring name Razor Ramon showed up in the crowd of Nitro and began talking about the end of WCW & telling all the viewer's that ""they were coming"". By doing this he had everyone thinking WWE was taking over. That never happened, but what did happen was the infamous formation of the NWO, which started a long winning steak in the ratings for WCW.
  As the 90s came to an end WWE finally regained  lead in the ratings war with 2 men by the names of Stone Cold Steve Austin and the Rock. They were so much into their characters that most wrestling fans believed that what these wrestlers were doing was real, thus drawing a thin line between reality and fantasy, which ultlmitly Drew more fans to the WWE, making this business very rich and widely popular.
  With this 3 hour movie you will go on a joy ride down history lane.

1981474,4,B000199JKC,"I had heard of this DVD for years but never really took interest in it until recently, partially thanks to WWE's move to PG! LOL!

This is a 90 minute documentary on one of the best periods of pro wrestling. You will hear from Eric Bischoff, Vince McMahon, Gerald Brisco, Mick Foley, ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio and many others about that period in time. You will see the rise of WCW, how Nitro revolutionized wrestling on TV and how it pushed Vince and Co. to improve their product. You will see the birth of the nWo and how it both put WCW on the map but also how it helped to ruin WCW as well. The stories of mis-management in WCW and its reluctance to push new stars and more!

Regardless of what you think of Eric Bischoff, I would say that without his WCW challenging Vince and the then-WWF, you wouldn't have seen the emergence of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, The Rock, Mick Foley and Triple H! You wouldn't have seen the edginess that became known as ""The Attitude Era."" I would also say that without WCW's mismanagement and insistance on pushing only the nWo and Goldberg, you wouldn't have ever seen the exodus of the backbone of that company, which (in my view) was Flair, Arn Anderson, Benoit, Guerrero, Jericho, Malenko, Perry Saturn, Mysterio and a host of others. You might not have seen any of these guys go to WWE if they would've gotten the proper push. A certain wrestling company named TNA might want to take heed of this DVD! For that matter, WWE might want to take a look back too! LOL!

Back to this subject, it also has a ton of extras. Highlights include Shawn Michaels & HHH Vs. The Legion Of Doom (prior to them becoming DX), Chris Benoit Vs. Booker T. from Nitro, Goldberg Vs. Hulk Hogan from Nitro, Austin stunning Vince McMahon for the first time and more!

Yes he was instrumental in helping the WWF during that time but to shift the focus away from what was really happening is pretty lame.

Interestingly enough, of all the promos and clips they show...one thing they do NOT show are the promos that say the WWF has gone to the US government to look into why WCW was running their show on the same night as RAW and making wrestling fans choose a side to be on. I remember seeing those promos and thinking...Vince...you are whining like a baby.

1981480,3,B000199JKC,"Ah, the Monday Night War.  I'm a child of this era, a wrestling fan who grew up on the head-to-head programs of WCW Nitro and WWF (now WWE) Raw.  Make no mistake about it: this was truly THE best time to be a wrestling fan.  Both companies were pushed to dish out the best they could offer and put on the best damn wrestling shows they could come up with to entertain their fans and stand alone and triumphant in the wrestling business.  The tale of the Ted Turner-owned WCW's spectacular rise and equally jaw-dropping fall in particular remains one of the most talked-about elements of wrestling history.  Therefore, I was really looking forward to a DVD that would allow me to both relive this era and explain the workings behind the crucial events within it.  Was it successful?  Did I learn anything?

Well, I did learn one thing for sure.  And that's the truth behind a quote from Sir Winston Churchill: ""History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.""

Basically, it's the tale of the history of WCW vs. the WWE, written in hindsight by the WWE.  Granted, Eric Bischoff is given a good amount of interview time to discuss his rise to power in WCW and the incredible innovations he made that nearly did the impossible and drove Vince McMahon out of business.  A lot of his segments were quite informative about how things were working on WCW's end during the era.  Of course, that could be because he's pretty much the only guy in the DVD who's defending WCW, but hey.

But mainly, the documantary's bias shines through, as expected.  With a few exceptions in which the WWE's mistakes along the way are, in fact, acknowledged (the Billionare Ted skits come to mind), a lot of it is devoted to painting WCW in a negative light both when they were on top (basically talking about how horrible Bischoff was for trying to put them out of business) and when they were struggling (highlighting just how big of incompetent doofs they were.  Although, to be fair, there's really no defending the outright idiocy of 1999-2001 era WCW, so this part is pretty much true and acceptable).  Some of it is understandable; guys like Big Show, Chris Jericho, the late Eddie Guerrerro, and Rey Mysterio, for example, all give justifiably negative comments, given how they all struggled under the weight of WCW's political machine.

But some of the bias is just re-freakin'-diculous.  I'm thinking here of Gerald ""The biggest lesson of the Monday Night Wars was 'don't mess with Vince McMahon!'"" Briscoe.  His relentless towing of the company line was the funny kind of ridiculous: I couldn't help but laugh every time he came up in the DVD and shamelessly buried his nose further down McMahon's kiester.

But some of the ridiculousness is just infuriating.  Here, I'm thinking of a comment by Vince himself during the section about Bischoff's going head to head with the WWF on Monday night: ""My philosophy of business is 'help yourself, don't hurt the other guy.'  And I daresay that Ted...has a different philosophy.  I think his philosophy is 'win any way you can.  If you can hurt the other guy, great.  That's good.'""

""Help yourself, not hurt the other guy,"" Vince?  Just like you ""didn't hurt"" all the territorial NWA promotors by signing away all their talent and stealing away their TV time?  Or Jim Crockett, when you drove him out of business when the WWE was already the top mainstream promotion?  Or Paul Heyman, when both you and WCW raided the roster of ECW and ripped off of Heyman's creative innovations?  Don't get me wrong: there's a good reason why Vince is the most successful promotor in history, due to his effective and downright ruthless business decisions.  But for him to cry and moan when somebody else pulls the same tricks on him, and claim himself to be some benevolent, non-competitive saint is a new low in hypocracy.  At least Gerald Briscoe made me laugh: this sort of B.S. makes my blood boil.

The pro-WWE bias aside, there's also problems with omission of certain events.  Most of the big turning points in the war, like the formation of the nWo, the Montreal Screwjob, and the start of Austin/McMahon, are present.  But some other things either aren't addressed in much depth (Vince Russo's reign of terror.  God, no words can describe how terrible that was), or aren't even addressed altogether (ex: The Fingerpoke of Doom.  I watched that incident live, and the sheer anger and scorn that it provoked among fans, as well as its representation of everything wrong with WCW's backstage structure, cannot be underscored).  For the most part, it's an okay overview of the era, but it's incomplete.

Yet for some reason, I still enjoyed this DVD, in the end.  It's a decent overview of some of the key events of that era.  And there's some pretty decent extras.  My favorites are two of WCW's biggest (and last) true mark-out moments: Goldberg's title win, and Ric Flair's return in Greenville.  And there's also a good 1997 Raw tag match featuring Stone Cold and HBK vs. the British Bulldog and Owen Hart, that really reminded me just what a great talent Owen was and made me miss him all over again.  However, the extras still aren't as rich as in other WWE DVD's.

I'm giving this DVD half-a-star off for Gerald Briscoe's shameless cheerleading, one full star off for Vince having the gall to play the victim when it comes to ruthless business practices, and another half off for its omissions in both the presentation and extras.  It's not too bad a DVD, but there are better.  It's definitely a nice, basic walk through memory lane of a classic era in pro wrestling.  But if you're looking for a more definitive examination of the historic events of wrestling from 1995-2001, particularly from WCW's side, I'd recommend Bryan Alvarez and R.D. Reynolds's excellent book ""The Death of WCW.""",1212192000,6,5823,4.723488602576809

The Monday Night War
WCW Monday Nitro VS WWF Raw, the greatest battle of all time wasn't fought in the ring but between those two franchises over ratings. This DVD shows the history of The Monday Night War accurately, yet somewhat it is somewhat biased considering WWE made it. WCW was a company that got over by using controversy and shock to steal the audience away from the long-standing empire known as WWF, now known as WWE. This DVD tells about the History of WWE and WCW before fighting on Monday Nights. They go into how WCW stole talent from WWF like Lex Luger, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and so on. It tells the roots of the nWo idea and how it put WCW in the lead. The Mexican and Japanese stars coming to America to work for WCW is explained. The struggles of WWF to stay alive, and how they used Austin, Jerry Springer-like segments, and new stars to elevate them back to the top. Various superstars tell all that went on during this amazing time. Chris Jericho, Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Big Show, Gerald Brisco, and many others tell this incredible story. In the end, WCW lost this war, but the fans won.

This DVD is an hour long and is one of WWE's best works. It's one of the DVDs you have to own if you are a wrestling fan. It may be bias, but it was fairly accurate. It isn't 5 stars because of the bias and it doesn't go too deep on the details. I still suggest this to anyone.

1981482,2,B000199JKC,"This could have been a semi-decent synopsis of the Monday Night Wars, but unfortunately objectivity is thrown by the wayside.  But then again, how else would you expect a WWE video from McMahon to be?  History is written by the victors...
What I really find insulting is the snippets from Brisco, Cornet and McMahon himself - they want to portray the WWF as this magnanimous company and WCW as some robber barons.  Anyone with knowledge of Vince and how he raided talent from the territories and put many out of business himself will find this an affront to one's sensibilities.  On numerous occaisions, it's lamented how McMahon had uncontracted talent leave because ""he took them at face value"" (poor, naive Vince trusted these sleazy guys too much you see).  Well, if they were worth so much to you, why the heck didn't you sign them?  How would you feel working for someone that won't sign you to a contract, that means no guarantees, no benefits, no pension, no insurance, any day could be your last if you get injured - I can't blame someone in that position for jumping ship for greener pastures.  WCW enabled a lot of wrestlers to make much better money, and in turn forced WWF to take better care of it's talent.  That's a bad thing?  Only if you're Vince I guess.

The most ironic thing about this movie is the admission that competition was the best thing ever to happen to wrestling and took it too it's high water mark during the Monday Night Wars - it was a fan's dream come true.  So now WWF without stout competition can go back to being fat and happy - oh joy.",1201392000,2,1577,4.4982456140350875

I was always a Raw fan, even when WCW winning the ratings war. This dvd is a 90 minute, half told story. I rather hear an unscripted story then this polished turd. I highly enjoy the book Death of WCW and those writers don't hold back. Its a great book and probably the closet will ever get to the real truth. The problems I had were Brisco's comments were just plain stupid and I love how Cornette gets all excited about the war. Maybe he'll be in a WWE VS TNA dvd one of these days but don't hold your breath. I found the end where WCW was going under very rushed, like no one wanted to talk about what really went on.

1981494,4,B000199JKC,"Good story that covers the Monday Night wars. I had two major problems with the DVD.

First, all of Ted Turner's properties had been merged with Time Warner/AOL. Turner did not have an active role or voice in the company. WCW, Atlanta Hawks, Atlanta Thrashers were among some of the ""Non Core Assets"" that Time Warner wanted to unload. The DVD did not mention this. It makes the war between Vince and Ted. In the end Ted was did not have a voice in the company that he built.

Second, Vinnie Mac acts like he is Lilly white and that he always took the high road. I think there was a lot of underhanded stuff from both camps. Vince was not pure as the wind driven snow and that is what he would have you believe.

 Also, Turner fought for wrestling when he was in charge. In the end he was not. It was a victory for Vinnie Mac but a hollow one.  Ted Turner was raising buffalo in the west and had not power to influence the properties he once held",1189987200,,946,4.175824175824176
1981495,4,B000199JKC,"This DVD is very interesting and after reading the reviews it is much better than most people say it is. It is much more UNBIASED than people say it is.

Many people believe it is biased when people on the DVD bash WCW. Many say that the wrestlers were forced to say bad things about WCW and not about WWE when in fact it is guys like Chris Benoit, The Ice Man, Eddy, Jericho, Ric Flair, Mic Foley, Jim Cornet, and especially Eric Bischoff; guys who have never been afraid to face the wrath of Vince McMahon (especially Foley, Flair, Cornet, and Bischoff).

Also people believe it is biased because Vince says in the DVD that he never believed in trying to destroy the competition. How this is biased I am not sure, especially when Vince never attacked WCW until they started using back door negotiations and revealing results of WWE RAW before it happened. Even to this day Vince is showing he isn't about trying to destroy the competition as he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of TNA when it blatantly attacks WWE on their program.

So don't let rumors of bias turn you away from this product as it is very interesting and not biased at all. Those who say it is are nothing more than die hard WCW fans who just cant let go.

The one thing I would complain about is the fact that it is more focused on major angles that everyone (even those who aren't hardcore wrestling fans) recognize and not individual angles that defined the era. It would have been nice for them to talk about the Austin v Hart Foundation, the wwe gang wars, the NWO wolfpack, and the wolfpack vs NWO vs WCW vs 4 Horsemen. But I guess it isn't really that big of a deal, but it would have been nice.

Monday Night Wars does a barely satisfying job covering the main points and highlights of the Monday Night Wars, with lots of focus on Eric Bischoff's involvement in WCW, including the nWo and the harsh competition between WWF and WCW.

But aside from that, there's little detail.  It's not as comprehensive as ""Rise and Fall of ECW"" was, and suffers as a result.  There's no mention of the infamous Fingerpoke of Doom and its implications for WCW, no mention of the David Arquette as WCW champion incident, Gillberg and the spoofing (aside from brief mention of a spoof of Jim Ross which was very poorly received by fans), etc.

On the plus hand, it does a satisfactory job of telling some of the backstage issues at WCW including Hogan and the nWo refusing to let others go over, and Vince Russo's ""reign of terror"" of sorts at WCW.

The bonus features are mostly WWF matches and some WCW matches, along with some random features like the WCW reformation of the Four Horsemen, and Rick Rude showing up on WWF Raw is War and WCW Nitro on the same night (and very little is elaborated on it, except that McMahon and Ross didn't realize he had left until they saw him live on TV).

A very poor production, all in all.  I don't know what held the WWE back in producing this DVD, or if they just wanted to chuck it out there for money, hoping to do as well with it as they had the Rise and Fall of ECW DVD.",1178323200,,1537,4.387323943661972

1981501,5,B000199JKC,"The Monday Night War was a period in sports entertainment that will never be repeated or forgotten. Both WCW and the WWF (now WWE) brought out the best in one another and in doing so, gave the fans some great moments and matches. Now the story can be told on DVD and video for the first time.

The Monday Night War began in September 95' when WCW's Senior Vice President, Eric Bischoff devised Monday Nitro. Deliberately going head-to-head with WWF Monday Night Raw, many fans and insiders predicted Bischoff to fail with his plan of Monday night domination. But he didn't. In fact, he actually beat the WWF in the ratings for an 18-month period, before the WWF bounced back in 98' and eventually became the true kings of Monday night wrestling (WCW went out of business in March 2001).

As this is a WWE production, there is obviously a large amount of WWE bias to it (for example, Vince McMahon is still convinced that he was battling Ted Turner's chequebook and nothing else). But there is still a surprising amount of credit given to the opposition from certain Superstars and WWE staff.

Eric Bischoff (who ran WCW during the ups and the downs) gives some very honest thoughts about the tactics he used to try and get viewers to switch of Raw. As this DVD will tell you, it was Bischoff who started the personal rivalry between the companies, by giving away pre-taped Raw results live on the air. Every other cheap shot is also included here (such as Madusa returning to WCW and binning the WWE Women's Title), as well as the WWE's (childish) reactions (i.e. the Billionaire Ted skits).

The birth of The NWO (which led to WCW's near 2-year dominace) is also featured as well as the birth of the Cruiserweight Division. Of course, WWE take great pride in describing how they came back (on the back of Austin VS McMahon) and maintained the lead for nearly 3 years.

That's one of the main problems with this DVD. WWE just can't wait to sing their own praises and put the boot to WCW in the process. There are also some shocking and hypocritical comments from Ric Flair to put up with, as well as some total garbage from Eddie Guerrero (and Gerald Briscoe's closing line is unbelievably stupid) Also most of the key moments of The War included can be seen elsewhere (e.g. DX invading WCW, Austin/McMahon etc).

The extras are pretty good. There's the Vince McMahon post-Montreal Double-Cross interview, DX VS LOD, British Bulldog and Owen Hart VS Stone Cold and Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit VS Booker T (although that's a bit short), Goldberg VS Hollywood Hogan and more.

Overall, this isn't the unbiased, truthful account that it should be. If it was produced independently (like Beyond The Mat, or Wrestling With Shadows) then it may have turned out differently. But it's still a nice trip down memory lane for fans and rounds up the Monday Night War quite well. Worth buying for historical significance more than anything.",1149984000,4,2929,4.69785575048733

The documentary covers from all the way back to the early days of both federations, the start of Nitro and all the dirty tricks played (giving away RAW results, Billionaire Ted skits, WWE stars showing up on Nitro only weeks after being on WWE TV), the rise of Mr. McMahon & Stone Cold & The Rock & Triple H, the innovation of the luchadors & ""real"" wrestlers into WCW, the backstage problems between Bischoff & Ric Flair, younger stars leaving WCW for WWE because they were held down by veterans & politics, Russo's time in WCW, and everything up to the final Nitro.

Austin & Michaels couldn't get along but both hated the Hart Foundation so they were forced to team up and delievered a great main event as all four men are great workers.
""RAW"" May '97
(Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin)

Legion Of Doom vs. D-Generation X - This marked the first time that Shawn Michaels & Triple H would team together under the name of ""D-Generation X.""  This was a good match for what it was with the L.O.D. using their power while DX countered by keeping the legal member of L.O.D. in their corner & Shawn using his speed.  The bigger issue here was what happened when the New Age Outlaws got involved and played a game of ""can you top this?"" with DX.
""RAW"" Dec. '97

Chris Benoit vs. Booker T - This was a match from their ""best of seven"" series they had in WCW to become the top contendor for the WCW Television Championship, which was held by Finlay who was watching at ringside.  Benoit as usual used his intense offense while Booker T (down 2 to 1 in the series at that time) took a more slower & grounded ""wear down"" offense with headlocks & armbars.  Again, the match was pretty short but it was good for what it was.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" June '98

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg - This was more about putting Goldberg over as WCW's ""superhero"" & top star more than anything else as Hogan threw everything he could at Goldberg by either wrestling him & resorting to cheating only for Goldberg to not be effected by it & keep coming back dominating his way to the WCW Championship.  With cameos from Dallas Page, Karl Malone, and Curt Hennig...this wasn't much as far as a ""match"" goes but this was all about making Goldberg the top superstar in WCW.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" July '98
(History Of The World Championship)

Other DVD extras featured infamous RAW & Nitro moments such as when Stone Cold stunned McMahon for the first time, Jim Cornette's controversial comments about ""icons in wrestling"", the ""Bret Screwed Bret"" interview with J.R. & Vince, Bischoff challenging McMahon to a fight, Ric Flair's return to WCW in Sept. of '99, and the story behind Rick Rude's appearance on RAW & Nitro on the same night. There are also 2 Confidential stories in here regarding the last WCW Nitro & when DX invaded WCW Nitro (same one on Best Of Confidential).

Bottom line is that if your fan of the Attitude/nWo era of wrestling as a majority of people are, I would suggest this just to see the matches & archival footage but not for the story because eventhough ""history is written by the winners"", the fans who saw it aren't stupid & knows that this isn't the real complete truth & history of the ""Monday Night War.""",1148688000,,4006,4.526970954356846
1981513,4,B000199JKC,"The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews.  I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD.  They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW.  I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info.  Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection.  I just wish they added more matches and interviews.  TNA better watch themselves.",1145491200,,856,4.285714285714286
1981514,4,B000199JKC,"-This DVD shows some, but definitely not all of the moments that made this war between the two companies so good. A few highlights include how WCW got older talent from WWF to help push Nitro into the ratings lead, such as Hogan, Savage, Luger, Hall and Nash, Eric Bischoff seems very honest in his comments about how he ran WCW and brought talent in, The NWO angle being born was a great segment as Hogan turned on the fans and joined the NWO, which made for great television, until the NWO grew so big, it got boring and repetitve, according some superstars.

-Other highlights include Stone Cold Steve Austin being created, loved Jim Cornette's comments on Austin's evolution, The Rock coming out of his shell, the Bret Hart screwjob angle (which was heavily glossed over) and the influx of the Attitude Era (which ECW obviously heavily influenced). A lot of stuff is left out here, too much to get into, but hopefully some day they'll do a Rise and Fall of WCW DVD. I liked how guys like Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit and others talk about how WWE was run way better than WCW, great comments.

-To sum up the documentary it's good, a nice time capsule, but it glosses over too many things, not shocking though since the running time is just about 95 minutes, not nearly long enough to give a good detailed bio of both companies. Again I thought Bischoff seemed very honest and truthful about his way of running WCW and other things he did, including dirty tricks he used to get viewers from WWE, like giving away results of Raw during the Nitro broadcast. I also enjoyed his comments on Lex Luger coming back to WCW in '95, very honest stuff and also when Medusa (Alundra Blaze) dropped the WWE women's title into the trash live on Nitro. In contrast Vince doesn't seem very honest at times.

-The extras include four matches, other backstage and in-ring footage:

-Stone Cold Steve Austin & Shawn Michaels vs. The British Bulldog & Owen Hart: Good match from Raw in '97, where Austin and Michaels end Bulldog and Hart's long title reign, despite how much they depised each other, during and after their win.

-Stone Cold Steve Austin stuns Vince McMahon: A segment that really helped launch the Austin/McMahon rivarly as Austin stuns Vince after the boss tells him he needs to go home and rest his neck.

-Jim Cornette Commentary: A great Jim Cornette promo, where he goes on a tirade like on James E. can.

-Vince McMahon Interview ""Bret Screwed Bret"": This is a great interview done shortly after the Montreal Screw Job, very heartfelt comments by Vince.

-Shawn Michaels & Triple H vs. The Legion of Doom: Good tag match, shortly after the DX storyline began. Chyna hits a low blow on Animal to cause a DQ, then the New Age Outlaws shave Hawk's hair and powerbomb Animal through the announcer's table.

-D-X invades WCW: D-X gets an old army jeep and goes to WCW headquarters then to the arena where Nitro is being held. Once there they get a lot of WCW fans to chants ""D-X"" and ""Nitro sucks"". Good segment.

-The Last Nitro: Confidential piece about the last nitro and how the WCW stars reacted to when Vince bought the company. I liked the superstar and Bischoff's comments on what happened and how they felt about WCW closing. Great overall segment.

-NWO in the Production Truck: When Scott Hall and Kevin Nash invaded the backstage production truck, funny and cool stuff. Pretty groundbreaking stuff actually.

-Eric Bischoff Challenges Vince McMahon: Bischoff's challenging Vince to a fight, good promo actually.

-Chris Benoit vs. Booker T: Great match between two great wrestlers. Lots of counter moves by both men and eventually Benoit gets Booker in the crossface and he taps out in about 8 minutes.

-Goldberg vs. Hulk Hogan: This match saw the mega launch of Goldberg as he beat Hogan for the WCW World Title with the spear and jackhammer. Major, major league pop for the finish, though the re-dubbing of the music with Goldberg's WWE music is pretty annoying.

-Ric Flair Returns to WCW: Great emotional segment that saw the return of Ric Flair. Nice promo by Arn Anderson and great promo by Flair. There was a major, major, major pop for Flair when he came out to the ring.

-Rick Rude Appears on Raw and Nitro in the same night: Cool segment that shows how the ravishing one jumped to WCW right after being on Raw. Comments from Jim Ross and a nice promo from Rick on Nitro are included in this segment.

-The extras are good, but there are a few too many that were already highlighted in the documentary, more features and matches on a second disc would have been nice too.

-Overall, this is a good purchase for anyone who watched either or both companies during this era, as it should bring back some memories, just don't look for an incredibly in-depth look.",1143504000,3,4783,4.6469194312796205
1981515,2,B000199JKC,For something that spanned so many years to sum it up in 90 minutes is just rediculous. There wasn't enough commentary by enough wrestlers and there wasn't enough clips of good moments from both sides.,1140393600,6,201,4.771428571428571
1981516,5,B000199JKC,"I'm not much into wrestling now. I'll watch a Raw episode if nothing is on T.V. but it just dosen't feel the same as it use to be. Why? Because there isn't that competition WWE use to have. If you weren't a WWE fan your a WCW fan, but if you weren't a WCW fan you were either WWE or ECW. Watching this dvd brought back alot of memories. WCW vs. WWE, man I remember that. I tune in to Raw see what they do and change the channel to see what Nitro was like. Pretty interesting stuff on here like how WCW got started, to their rise to the top,WCW stealing WWE stars like Disel,the begining of NWO, beating WWE in the ratings, to WWE coming back to take over, and WCW's fall. You get interviews from Vince McMahon and Eric Bishof, plus WWE superstars like HBK, Ric Flair, and Former WWE superstar Mick Foley. But is this a one sided story, well yes it is but you can't blame Mr. McMahon. Come on do you really think Vince is going to make the WWE look bad. Hell no, he's going to make WCW look bad and make him look innocent. It's his DVD now, not WCW.  But overall great video.

1981518,5,B000199JKC,"Between September of 1995 and March of 2001, I spent most of my Monday nights with my thumb on the ""return"" button on my remote.  When I first heard that WCW was going to put a show on Monday nights opposite the old WWF I thought wow, nice try WCW.  I thought they were commiting suicide.  But by July 1996 with the arrival of the New World Order, my mind changed.  I was a huge mark for the nWo.  I still have the t-shirt, the hat and even a coffee mug.  But as this DVD shows, WCW set itself up for destruction.  Things from bad writing to weak ideas to even stealing WWF's storylines all caused an early demise.  And speaking of the nWo, that angle went on for 4 years!  At the beginning our reaction was, ""Wow! I can't wait to see what the nWo is going to do next"" to ""Oh, the nWo . . . are they still here?""  It got really boring to see the belt on either Hogan, Nash, Page or the luckiest quasi-celebrity ever, Goldberg.  WCW had nothing in their bag of tricks to keep up with the WWF.  They learned the hard way the single most important rule in the industry: DON'T CROSS VINCE McMAHON.  I hope TNA is taking notes.",1134604800,,1122,4.091743119266055
1981519,5,B000199JKC,"Being a fan before and after (not as much quality sucks now) the Monday Night Wars I can appreciate the look back. It chronicals a time where you didn't know what to expect or who was going to work where. This DVD shows all parts except a few missing pieces. I can though appreciate how much better things got when it was a two car race when WCW really picked up their pace and The Duengeon of Doom was no longer in their main events. Regardless, ECW was the better company as far as work,heart and talent but that is another story. This DVD is especially important now because the quality of WWE programming is pretty weak. The best thing WWE puts out are these classic DVD releases and not their current stuff. So if you like the past better than the present check this release out and reflect on the good ol days before the monopoly ruined wrestling.",1130371200,,853,4.371069182389937
1981520,4,B000199JKC,"The telling of the story was well done.  The insights of the people involved were intriguing.  For those who weren't fans during the monday night war it's an interesting tale of the highest point in wrestling's history.  For those who were fans it's a nice trip down memory lane.  A few things to note.  It could have done without Gerald Brisco who's obviously in love with Vince Mcmahon.  It's also funny to listen to the hypocrisy of Vince who cried foul at WCW's tactics when he did the same things to put other wrestling companies out of business when he was building his own company.  It also dodges the issue that Eric Bishoff was as much responsible for the decline of WCW as he was it's rise.  Instead pinning most of the blame on other people.

All in all it's an excellent DVD and a must have for diehard wrestling fans.  Really the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there are only four matches on it.  With all the great matches on RAW and Nitro during that time I was disapointed that they gave such a small sample.",1126224000,2,1053,4.376288659793815
1981531,3,B000199JKC,"For those of us who were loyal WCW fans during the raging Monday Night War, this is an excellent DVD for both WCW footage and the extra matches. As far as telling the true story of the War, however, this documentary is a textbook example of WWE bias. For the most part, the documentary portrays the WCW and its president, Eric Bischoff, as being a bunch of irascible tyrants who cynically delcare a war of survival on McMahon's WWF. As was to be expected of the WWE, the documentary does not interview many of the key WCW superstars who were at the center of the conflict such as Hogan, Nash, and Hall. McMahon presents himself as the innocent bystander in the whole ordeal with Foley and Brisco sucking up and kissing his ass thoughout the entire documentary. He also uses the documentary to boast of his victory and aquisition of WCW. Meanwhile, Eric Bischoff, the ambitious man who took Ted Turner's WCW (which was little more than a joke at the time) and turned it into a competitive superpower and the only wrestling company to ever out do McMahon's empire, is portrayed as an ""unethical"" bully who's only purpose was to destroy lives, or as Foley puts it on the DVD, comparing Bischoff's business style to that of the Godfather, ""We'll kill your kid but it's nothing personal."" If I were just rating the extra matches on the DVD I'd give it 5 stars no questions asked. The extras alone are worth buying the DVD. I'm a loyal WWE fan today, and I think regardless of how bias this documentary is, it cannot hide the fact that had Bischoff and WCW not challenged McMahon in the bold way that they did, sports entertainment might very well have been nothing more than a joke today. Also, McMahon can say or think whatever he wants, but he and everyone else in the WWE knows that it was Bischoff's competitive challenge that got them where they are today. I truly believe the DVD makes that clear, regardless. Overall, I recommend this DVD if for nothing more than the great WCW footage, the extra matches, and at least getting to hear Bischoff tell it the way it really went down. If you're looking for the truth about the whole Monday Night War, don't waste your money.",1125878400,8,2172,4.543367346938775
1981532,4,B000199JKC,"I think one thing we were expecting was everything revealed, which this DVD does not do. I loved the first half of the DVD, which seems the more honest side, but towards the end, they never really show WCW's final year, they never talked about Hogan sewing WCW, or WCW losing attendance numbers, and those were big discussions back in 2000 and 2001 with PWI magazines and underground sites, and this DVD doesn't bring that up. I believe everything that all the former WCW superstars said, Mick Foley is kind of hard to believe because he smiles through out his whole interview and makes it less convincing. Vince Mcmahon, i hardly believe him when he says he wasn't really paying attention to what WCW was really doing, anyone who saw Hit-man Hart: Wrestling With Shadows, knows that is completely false. Also, he says his way of business is help yourself but not hurt the other guy, i believe the part help yourself, but i don't believe don't hurt the other guy. Eric Bischoff, is believable, because when he is bashing WWE on WWE's DVD, you have to know he is being honest. Ric Flair sounded bitter in his interviews, especially in his comments about Eric Bischoff.

When all added up, half is being honest, and half isn't and that half is mostly Vince Mcmahon or other staff in WWE. I would of like interviews with Triple H, he was in WCW for a short time, Steve Austin, how about some former Staff of WCW. All they really have to do interviews for WCW's side, are 3 or 4 former WCW stars and Eric Bischoff, Hulk Hogan didn't even do an interview.

Overall, if you want to add to your wrestling tapes and DVD's, go ahead, or if you want to be entertained for 2 or 3 hours, this is a good choice. But if you are looking for the complete story, no. Quite frankly, i think they should of done more with this.",1125619200,2,1808,4.426426426426427

In the short of it, the WWE won. Like they say that the victors of war alter history in their favor, this collection is no different. The WWE plays itself as a victim of sorts against the ""rogue WCW"".

While it ultimately makes the Documentary more entertaining, you can't help but wonder if it tells the ""whole truth"".

It's awsome to see some of the moments that were great contributions to the Monday Night wars and hear vince and Bischoff's take of them.  They definatly did the best they could

 Granted it is biased and leaves out a bunch, and rewrites a little bit of history....  but as I said its the best they could do considering they couldn't get rock, hogan, austin, nash, hall, bret hart, or any of those guys to interview,some of the stuff that was really cool but didn't have a major impact (I.E-Fake Diesel & Ramon, Warrior & Piper return, Details on the Radicals debut, Russo's reign and fireing of Hulk Hogan, & more stuff on Bret Hart and dyeing Days of WCW) would have been sweet & they definatly would have added to the DVD but them not being there doesn't hurt the DVD.

ALl that aside, still a great DVD, it seems like it was a little rushed and thats why they did with what they had.  Should have done a three hour DVD like The Rise and Fall of ECW, maybe now that they've seen the success of that DVD they might put out something to go with this featuring a lot of the things that are mentioned in the other reviewers reviews.

A nice trip down memory lane nonetheless. Gerry Brisco is such an ass kissing yes-man. Those segments alone made me want to Ebay this DVD.

WWE's starting to look like the WCW of 1999-2001 now... They could sure use some competition again. They might start producing better shows...",1107043200,6,611,4.554545454545455
1981536,3,B000199JKC,"For someone who didn't realy tune into Pro-wrestling until late 2000, by which point the wars were basically over, ""the Monday Night Wars"" does a decent job of presenting a brief synopsis of what was missed.  Think of the blurbs that preceeded episodes of dramatic television shows to let you know what has happened and where you are in the story.  If you don't know what the Monday Night Wars were or what happened, this DVD would be a good buy, as it gives you the gist fairly well.  Once you become a bit more interested in the topic, however, you'll wish that there was a lot more to this DVD.  As always, the WWE chooses to interview only the people who they have employed when they make the DVD, and even makes some strange choices among their own employees.  This gives the account of what happened a very one sided feel, and creates some doubt in the viewer as to whether they are getting the whole story.  It is also frustrating to spend so much time hearing from people like Gerald Briscoe who, while I'm sure he witnessed a lot and was very involved with the Wars, is not exactly the type of personality to excite wrestling fans across the globe.  It becomes even more puzzling when one views the special features and realizes that the WWE had plenty of people who would have known a lot about what was going on, who they chose not to talk to.  Scott Steiner, Booker T, Rey Mysterio, all of these people should have been heard from more in the main feature of the DVD rather than just the special features.  The ultimate example of this is Kevin Nash.  One would be hard pressed to find a single person who represented the Monday night Wars more than Kevin Nash, aside from possibly Scott Hall.  While Hall's absence is understandable, the WWE had Nash under contract at the time, and yet did not use any of his interviews anywhere but in the special features.  It would also have been nice to have heard from Stone Cold, who is never too far away from being under WWE contract.  In light of the Rise & Fall of ECW DVD, the length of the ""Monday Night Wars"" is a bit disappointing, and the special features leave something to be desired.  At least one match involving Sting (a mainstay of WCW who to this day has never set foot in a WWE ring) would have been nice, as well as some stuff with the Outsiders and the Rock.  This DVD is decent as an ""abridged version"" of what happened, but don't come here looking to learn more about specific details.",1105833600,7,2459,4.397350993377484
1981537,4,B000199JKC,"Don't be confused with all the great WWE comps. that are coming out lately. This is essentially just a documentary with a few matches thrown in for fun. However it's pretty good (although a bit biased :-). It chronicles WCW coming out of nowhere and eventually destroying WWF in the ratings until suddenly, miraclously, poor Vince comes back from bankruptcy to again reign supreme, eventually buying WCW and ""winning the war"". Seriously, some of the things (especially said by Vince) is pretty hypocritical and it's like a Michael Moore production, always showing what he wants the public to see and leaving out anything positive from the other side. Still that's the bad stuff, there's a lot of great moments such as the birth of the NWO, Austin 3:16 and DX. The return of Ric Flair and his speech about Bischoff is awesome! Also it includes lots of the McMahon/Austin feud which really turned WWF over the top. Plus anything by Jim Cornette is worth hearing once as well. Still they missed out a lot like Hogan/Sting and the great crusierweight division that built a strong fan base for WCW. And what about that 10-man tag team match with Austin's team Vs. Hart's team? Now 4 the matches:

1) Owen Hart/Davey Boy Smith Vs. Steve Austin/Shawn Michaels - WWF Tag-Team title - Austin was feuding with Team Canada and  accepted help from HBK. Awesome RAW match. ****1/2

2) The Road Warriors Vs. HBK/HHH - Not a great match, I guess it's here to show how powerful DX was, much like the NWO was in WCW. **

3) Booker T Vs. Chris Benoit - Pretty good match. This was #4 of the best of 7 matches. ***

4) Hollywood Hogan Vs. Goldberg - After defeating Scott Hall, Goldberg got the chance to defeat Hogan in front of like a million fans. Much like Hogan/Warrior or Hogan/Rock this match is great because of the fact the fans were SCREAMING to see Hogan get beat. ****

But do you know what they REALLY needed? A 2nd disk labeled ""Raw Vs. Nitro Wrestlecrap"" including all the stuff that the Monday Night war caused like Hogan Vs. Ultimate Warrior 2, celeb wrestlers including Leno, Rodman, Malone and WCW Hvwyweight champ Arquette. What about the fingerpoke of doom and fake Razor/Diesel? Oklahoma? And how about a 2hr documentry about Vince Russo, the man who basically destroyed WCW. The ""war"" created some real crap.

1981540,4,B000199JKC,"The Monday Night Wars is a time in Wrestling History that will never happen again.  This documentary covers this time like none other starting from Eric Bischoffs humble beginings as the Executive Vice President of WCW all the way through the troublesome turmoil of variouse reigns by men like Vince Russo.

However there was once a time when WCW was supreme.  this is clearly shown by such story line angles as the NWO, Bill Goldbergs rise to Superstardom, and the return of the 4 horsemen.  Meanwhile this also shows how Vince McMahon was essentially forced to go into the Attitude Era or else face the end of his creation.

Overall the documentary itself is very well done (not as good as Rise and Fall of ECW but still good).  The problem with this is the total lack of big matches or good matches for that matter on the DVD.  In fact the only big match on here is the title match between Hogan and Goldberg.  Also like I mentioned in the Rise and Fall of ECW it would of been nice to have heard from some other key players who were not with the company.  For example it would of been great to hear from the founding members of the NWO, Stone Cold Steve Austin, the Rock, Bill Goldberg and so on.  The people who we do hear from is great, but from a historical standpoint I would of also like to of heard from some of these key players, just so once again, the full story.  However you can only take what is given and this is a great DVD.  Would I of liked to have seen more, yes, but this is still recomended.",1102723200,,1514,4.273684210526316
1981551,5,B000199JKC,"Let me just say this is the #1 DVD on my list of 130.  This is possible the greatest DVD ever released.  Take my word for it.

WCW had a much better business then RAW because they ran on air for 83-straight weeks.

Goldberg vs. Hulk Hogan was possibly one of the best matches ever and the crowd goes crazy when Goldberg lifts Hogan up for the Jackhammer.

There are also great extras with all differnt comments from superstars on RAW and Nitro which I found really cool.

This is a must have DVD you must pick it up.",1102118400,,516,4.161616161616162
1981552,5,B000199JKC,"Great DVD, especially for those of us who used to follow Wrestling post 1995. Brings back a lot of memories. The Hogan-Goldberg Match was truly something special. The documentary, simply outstanding. If you were truly into WCW wrestling, you'd get a bit sentimental at the end of the documentary and you'd wish WCW was still around. Whatever people say doesnt really matter - Eric Bischoff is truly one amazing guy and so is Vince. Still watch the WWE faithfully. Miss the old timers though. The new DVD - Rise and Fall of ECW is something to add to your collection, just in case you've bought this Raw vs Nitro DVD.

1981553,4,B000199JKC,"I was looking forward to this DVD, and overall I was not disappointed. Although the winners always write history, the facts were there for the most part.

 The ratings war between WCW and the WWF created the most entertaining era in professional wrestling, in my opinion. This DVD covers the story starting with the creation of Monday night RAW, and then almost 3 years later..the creation of WCW Monday Nitro, and how the two shows pulled out all the stops to defeat eachother. It would have been nice to hear from more than a handful of the participants in the Monday night wars, though. The story is presented clearly to those who don't know about it, and the fact that Turner and Bischoff wanted to put Vince out of business is shoved down our throats, with McMahon himself even complaining about WCW's ruthless tactics...talk about being a hypocrite. The most laughable part was when Shawn Michaels commented that the WWF didn't care about ratings at first, which is just a bold faced lie.

 The best part of the DVD is the extra matches which are taken from 1997 & 1998. 1997 produced some of the most creative and exciting matches and storylines, and we get 2 matches from that era from WWF RAW is WAR. Michaels/Austin vs. Owen/Bulldog is highly recommended, and the crowd, commentary, and atmosphere are just amazing. Michaels/Helmsley vs. LOD is another classic from RAW, and is a good representation of the time period.

WCW offers us 2 matches from 1998, which took place after WWF had already beaten WCW's rating streak. Goldberg vs. Hogan from July 1998 is THE highlight of WCW in '98, and was probably the last glimmer of hope from the company, as they bet the barn on Goldberg. Check out the reaction from the crowd when Goldberg lifts Hogan up for the Jackhammer. Benoit vs. Booker T is another quality match, and shows us that yes...Booker was actually a good worker at one point.

 There are few other good extras on this DVD, but you'll have to buy it to see them. I recommend this DVD for any wrestling fan. Check it out!",1094947200,3,2041,4.637119113573407
1981554,4,B000199JKC,"By far, the greatest DVD WWE has ever released. Now you can re- live all the classic moments from WCW's first show, to the shocking announcement that Shane McMahon had bought WCW. This DVD will change your perspective on how you look at the ratings war that lasted for a few years.",1093651200,,281,4.423076923076923
1981575,4,B000199JKC,"The good:  This disc covers the major highlights of the Monday Night War in addition to providing some background on the 2 companies involved before the war got started.  This was some of the better footage with seeing the old Manhattan Center and comparing it to 1996 and then to today.  Some WWE personnel were also able to vent their feeling on what was wrong with WWF and well as WCW with Jim Cornette and Mick Foley being the best interviewed.  The ""extra"" moments were all very good.
The not so good:  There were still too many guys who weren't able to speak about this whole issue (Nash, Hall Hogan, Bret).  The bonus matches which are often the highlight of WWE DVD were a total dud.  I can understand not having any PPV matches but none of the best matches from Raw or Nitro were there with the possible exception of Goldberg vs Hogan on Nitro.  The Raw matches were adequate but I can think of several just off the top of my head that were higher quality by far.
Bottom Line:  Despite the unusually substandard extras package the main feature is put together about as good as possible this close to the war being over.  It does an excellent job of taking fans who followed the Monday Night War closely and giving some insight and a lot of memories on what was a wonderful time for professional wrestling.  There's a distinct ""they started it and we finished"" flavour from the WWE but it rings true and does a better job than I expected of giving WCW its props for putting up the best fight Vince and the WWE ever had.

1981577,2,B000199JKC,"Wrestling fans could give you a better description of what happend between 1995-2001, than the WWE. Think Vince was going to tell it from both sides, never.
So before wasting money on this, here's my take. After signing Hulk Hogan and some other WWE Talent, Bischoff foolishly decided to challenge the WWE on Monday Nights, and guess what, it was a decision that worked. WCW was kicking Vince's [back] and all he did was whine and moan, while Bisch was happily giving away results to Raw and signing away more WWE cast offs. Bischoff hit paydirt with the nWo angles, along with the transformation of Sting, which was forgotten, and Kick-[butt] cruiserweight action. Meanwhile, the WWE was doing the same ol' big man, GI Joe vs. Cobra crap, that fans cared little about. Then it hit the fan for Vince, at the Survivor Series 97, with Bret Hart, he was so doomed.
 But then a sleazy writer named Vince Russo, who was trahsed and not given credit for anything and for good reason, decided to go for broke with Austin and DX plus Vinny Mac's going all out and creating the Mr. McMahon as of a results to the Survivor Series is what  turned the tide for the WWE. WCW, as always was marred with politics, and with the addition of Time Warner peeing all over the product, the ship began to sink. On Raw, Austin and McMahon feud skyrocketed the ratings, sibling rivalry between taker and Kane, a feud between DX and the Nation, who's leaders were budding superstars The Rock and Triple H, tilted it back in the favor of the WWE, where it stayed.
What did WCW do in response, they followed the politicians lead and kept all the storylines on the nWo, split them up, and bored people to tears. Old, talentless men got pushes, legends got shafted. Rising stars like Jericho, Benoit, The Guerrero's, Raven, Booker T, and others were stuck mediocrity thanks to backstage politics. Only star to be made was Goldberg, and the political machine even froze that. They signed Bret Hart and did absolutely nothing with him, to note, and I mean nothing. In the end, a mass exodus beginning with Paul Wight (The Big Show) began and didn't end, until 2001, leaving WCW with a bunch of old guys and stars who were to green to carry a carnival. Guys like Booker, Kidman, Storm and others tried hard, Sting and Flair carred the banner till the end, but by then the ship was too far in the water.
Meanwhile, WWE was raiding ECW out of business and blending them in with fresh talent like Angle, The Hardyz, Edge, and Christian.
WCW runaways like Wight, Jericho, and Benoit immediately made an impact. WCW only managed to sign away Jeff Jarrett, who uh what's the word yeah sucks, from the WWE, under not one but two Russo reigns that looked to be a mixture of barnyard politics and mental retardation. WWE had the Raidcals, Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Saturn and Malenko, WCW would have the Misfits In Action, Hugh Morrus (Bill DeMott), the Wall, and Chavo Guerrero, Jr- who was miused along with Morrus. And they wondered why no one was watching Nitro. While Rock and Triple H were tearing down the house with classic WWE Title Matches, WCW
offered us the epic Sid Vicious-Tank Abbott or The Wall or the Jeff Jarrett saga. Booker T was one of the last promising stars they had, and instead of grooming him, he parades around as GI Bro, meanwhile Kurt Angle is being carefully groomed to be the star he is today in the WWE.
This is from someone who watched both shows. Vince didn't beat WCW all by himself and in no way as portrayed in this DVD. Time Warner wasn't all the blame here either. Stupidity always dominated WCW from the era of Jim Heard's Ding-Dong's-PN News-Johnny B. Badd's, to Bill Watts No Top Rope non sense, Bisch's and Vinny Ru's Politics and BS'n. It finally caught up with them, Time Warner had no patience to put up with their stupidity and sold them to Vinny Mac for cheap, after cancelling all thier shows. WCW was the cause of WCW's downfall. This is just my take on it after renting the DVD and laughing at all of this tomfoolery!
DVD is just Vince gloating and claiming victory, don't blame him, but you're better off asking fans who witnessed the Monday Night Wars and watched both Raw and Nitro, before picking this up.",1089072000,10,4218,4.563324538258575
1981578,5,B000199JKC,"I had long anticipated this DVD, and it didn't disappoint. It exceeded my expecations, as I was afraid it would be a one-sided perspective, which it was not. I have been a wrestling fan since I was 7 years old (I am 19 now) and was a major fan of WCW as well as WWF/E. Bottom line: Eric Bischoff is a genius, and he cannot be knocked. Without his wit and quick tounge, there is no way Nitro would have set the ratings records that it did. However, Bischoff made the mistake of putting some of the washed-up old timers over to the point of which younger stars, such as Jericho, Benoit, etc. became almost obscure. However, what the dvde forgets is that this is not what dealt WCW the most damage; the dvd fails to put an emphasis on Bischoff's spending habits, as well as the influx of celebrities into WCW. True, WWF had the Michaels-Austin-=Tyson escapade, but that was one time. During the Summer of 1998, I watched as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone became involved in both matches and storylines, and by 1999, musicians such as the Misfits, KISS, and even Master P(!) are involved. This, in my mind, dealt even more damage to WCW than their failure to push non-veteren superstars (Other than Goldberg, of course). Meanwhile, the WWF was not only pushing new talents, but by Late 1999-early 2000 actually put more of an emphasis on athletics (which WCW had done in 1996-97 with Malenko, Mysterio, Benoit, etc.) with an incredible feud between Mick Foley and HHH, as well as Kurt Angle, the Hardys, the Dudleyz, and the superstars that had left WCW about that time (such as the Radicalz). I am probably one of the few fans that LIKES Bischoff; he adds flavor to RAW in 2004 (which, thanks to Chris Benoit, Kane's new character, and Edge's return; not to mention this now two year  feud between shawn michaels and HHH that just never gets old), but the fact remains that he DID piss away everybody's $$$$ (If you don't already know, read ""sex, lies, and headlocks"" to find out how!). Nevertheless, getting rid of Bischoff was a mistake (He MADE Nitro), and by this point (late summer-early fall of 1999), the war was pretty much over, although it didn't ""officially"" end until March 26, 2001. Until seeing this DVD, I hardly knew anything about what was going on in WCW after January of '99, because I had simply lost interest, but was stunned by what I saw. At the time, J.R. was suffering from Bell's palsy, which led to one of his eyes becoming smaller than the other, and Ed Ferrara made fun of him in an attempt to boost ratings (""Pinata, Pinata""), which by the way, failed miserably. The fact that Ferrara would do theat is simply despicable. Jim Ross has given everything he has to the business since the 1970s and does not deserve anything but the respect of his peers; Ross and Mike Tenay are the greatest commentators that ever lived. I think Vince Russo (who I do not like AT ALL) also bid himself up beyond his capabilities and truly made a fool of himself at Bash at the Beach 2000 (you should look up a synopsis of this PPV on line to see the entirety of this tirade; it's pretty shocking; in the tirade he also says that Booker T had been in WCW for 14 years!!!!!...I don't even know if Booker was wrestling in 1986!)  By 2000, you barely heard mention of WCW anymore (and the nWo was a pop culture phenomenom from '96-'98!!), whereas the WWF was, quite literally, everywhere (The Rock, Stone Cold and Mick Foley had become so popular that they were actually mainstream celebrities; Mick Foley became a New York times best seller two times over). Nevertheless, WCW had talents every bit as great as those in WWF, but most of these were lost to Vince during this period of time:
Eddie Guerrero
Chris Benoit
Dean Malenko
Chris Jericho
Big Show
Perry Saturn
There were also those who made it to WWE later or never did:
Rey Mysterio
Booker T
Juventud Guerrero
Scott Steiner
Diamond Dallas Page (who I actually met on a flight from New York to Orlando in December of 1999; he's a helluva nice guy, and he told me just how REAL wrestling really is)
NOT ONE OF THESE TALENTS EVER GOT A MAJOR PUSH UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE (Booker T won the title 5 times between late '99 and '01 and was the last WCW champion and Steiner practically owned WCW in '00-'01). However, there is one more reason for the downfall of WCW which IS mentioned very briefly by Gene Okerlund in this dvd: WCW wrestlers could mess television tapings whenever they wanted; they could call in sick at any time. It is well documented that Goldberg, Hogan, Hall, Savage, and others took advantage of the provision at various times. Great DVD, but for more in depth coverage of the Raw-Nitro wars, and the wrestling business in general, read ""Sex Lies and Headlocks"". Nevertheless, the ""Monday Night War"" is a sure fire ""do not miss"".",1086652800,,4803,4.532258064516129
1981579,5,B000199JKC,"Well, since I did not have access to cable TV during the start of the Monday Night War, this DVD is very informative on what Bischoff and McMahon had to do in order to beat each other in the ratings.  It shows the most important storylines that created a new surge in popularity, the NWO for WCW and Stone Cold, as well as DX for the WWE.  I thought it was even-handed and both Bischoff and McMahon stated that they played dirty in order to get the upper hand.  Maybe there were some unknown tactics left out but I thought it explained a lot.  By the end of the feature, it was clear that many WCW stars wanted out and that the WWE was willing to push new stars and that's why WWE won the war.  Basically, this is a good look at the stuff that goes on behind the scenes and it also shows the most creative period in wrestling for both companies.",1085443200,,845,4.128048780487805
1981580,2,B000199JKC,Sadly this is just another promo for Vince McMahon and the WWE the site of Vince McMahon playing the victim in this DVD is a joke Vince McMahon is the guy who put Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association out of business by stealing every single peice of decent talent that the company had. Until it finally went out of business there are several things that the DVD fails to mention. One being the number of lawsuits that were launched as a result of the Monday Night Wars most of those by the WWE. If your pro WWE this is a good DVD if your interested in the truth it's not. If you want truth in wrestling DVDs save your money and pick up Wrestling With Shadows the story of the Bret Hart screw job. Or Beyond The Mat these are much better DVDS because they are out of the control of McMahon and the WWE. Although they did try and gain control of those too and failed each time. Bottom line is that this DVD is enjoyable for what it is and it is well produced though the highlight has to be Jim Cornettes rant. And that's my opinion,1082678400,8,1037,4.21608040201005

1981583,5,B000199JKC,"Although there is a lot of stuff that the WWE could not elaborate on in more detail because of time constraints, the Monday Night War is a great documentary on the fierce rivalry between WCW and the than WWF.  It has a lot of good info and suprisingly is not changed to make the WWE look better, although a few of Vince Mcmahon's comments aren't exactly truthful, but nevertheless on the whole, it is an accurate depiction of the monday night wars.  The extras are great with two matches from wcw and two wwf matches.  My only gripe with these matches is that they skip the entrances and post-match celebrations and they dubbed Goldberg's current WWE music over his old one!  Other extra's include Austin's first stunner on Mcmahon, Rick Rude appears on both Raw and Nitro in the same night, Cornette's commentaries, the Last Nitro, and more!
These are selling fast so I'm sure a Vol. 2 is in the works.  I highly recommend this dvd",1080691200,,932,4.5568862275449105
1981584,4,B000199JKC,"While I don't really pay attention to wrestling like I did in the past, I started getting into WWE (back then known as the WWF) right when the Monday Night Wars were at their most intense peak.  This was when Stone Cold was the most popular WWE superstar and his rivalry with Vince McMahon was getting out of control each week.  This was also when The Rock was a heel that quickly grew on you, as the crowd would always repeat all of his sayings when he'd try to talk.  Bash the crowd, he would, but that wouldn't stop the crowd from ""singing along"" with him.  I admit that I didn't really pay attention to the WCW, but I knew of the battle between the two corporations.
""The Monday Night War"" finally reveals to you the complete (or as complete as it's going to get) story about the rivalry between the two giants, the WWE and the WCW.  Here, you get all of the dirt and the low-down tricks that were implemented by each group.  In one corner there's Vince McMahon, who takes his Monday night programming to new and subtle heights.  In the other corner is Eric Bishoff, who manages Ted Turner's WCW company.  Determined to bring new blood and a new flavor to the game, Bishoff takes it up a notch by offering unpredictable wrestling programming that would endanger Vince's empire.  The changes would force Vince to change the face of wrestling entertainment as we now know it.  The fight between the two was brutal, vicious, and threatened the careers of hundreds upon hundreds of wrestlers on both sides.
This DVD was really interesting to watch, as I had no idea how close the WWE was to going out of business, and I had no idea of the impact that Bischoff had on the WWE.  Now that the two corporations are joined into one, both are able to reveal their stories and candid commentary without restraint.  You hear comments from McMahon, Bishoff, wrestlers, and other former employees of the two giants.  The program proves to be very honest and straight to business.  And, as intense as the battle was between the two, no matter how vicious or brutal it was, it definitely had a positive impact on Vince's corporation.  In a way, I wished the two were still going at it today as opposed to being all lumped into one organization.  If that were the case, maybe I'd still be intrigued to watch today.
The DVD has some cool things to offer, other than the original program that runs about over an hour and a half.  Extras include about 86 minutes of bonus footage that includes matches, events, and other benchmarks that intensified that Monday Night Wars between the two organizations.  It would've been cool to have some more extra footage, as there were TONS of things that could be included in the wars between the two giants, but 3 hours of programming isn't too shabby.
""The Monday Night War"" is a thought-provoking and energized look into the wrestling industry like never before.  Learn about the betrayals, the back stabbings, the fear of losing jobs, and much more on this very entertaining DVD.  Former and recent wrestling fans will want to include this in their collection.

The DVD goes beyond wrestling and into a war of two huge companies. The media giant Ted Turner VS Vince Mchahon. The extras on the DVD were great to like Goldbeg Vs Hulk Hogan. My favorite extra is DX invading WCW like DX sending a small amoured tank with guns was just so funny.

They show anything and everything and hold nothing back. I personally liked WWF much much more then WCW but I guess I never really realized just how bad WWF was being smashed by WCW. Don't get me wrong WCW had awesome talent but as I look back to 95 and through the years of the battle I thought WCW didn't know how to use the talent in which they had. I thought the story lines were stupid WWF had better storylines better matches, Better Pay Per Views and so on...WCW did slaughter WWF for 83 consective weeks but like i said in my opinion I still felt WWF was the better program due to the way they used their talent, better matches, and better pay per view events

1981593,3,B000199JKC,"For the first half-hour or so, I was enjoying this look at the WWE/WCW rivalry that made Monday nights so interesting just a few short years ago. Then, something happened...the remainder of the documentary, for the most part, dwelled on only one half of the Monday Night participants--the WWE half. The stories/matches that made WCW so good/so compelling to watch during 1996/97 were pushed into the background, and the documentary plunged into a ""What WWE Did to Fight Back"" mode.
Why should I have expected anything different? This was, after all, produced by Vince McMahon's company. But come on, guys. Your DVD title DID imply a look at both sides. And I was hoping for a fair and balanced look...no such luck. Vince McMahon is portrayed as the knight in shining armor who rescued his company from upstarts Ted Turner and Eric Bischoff.
I'm not totally unhappy with the DVD--and fans of WWE will love it in spite of my complaints, because there is a wealth of vintage footage featuring superstars such as Stone Cold Steve Austin. If nothing else for WCW fans, there is pristine footage taken from classic Nitros and WCW Saturday Night programs, and bonus matches as extras. Having these preserved in the durable DVD format was worth the price of the disc.
However, as a documentary, it fell woefully short...for those of us who have fond memories of WCW during that time, at least.",1078099200,6,1385,4.823529411764706
1981594,5,B000199JKC,"Up until 1995, WCW had always been thought of as small time compared to the WWE. The WWE was the only company with an established Monday night show called RAW. However, in 1995 an ambitious man named Eric Bischoff was put in charge by Ted Turner. Bischoff created a live WCW show on Monday nights called Nitro. From there Bischoff would acquire big time WWE stars like Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall which lead to the greatest faction in wrestling history called the NWO. From that moment on, the WCW defeated the WWE 86 straight weeks in the ratings. This DVD will take you step by step through the whole entire Monday night war and show how the WWE eventually managed to overcome the WCW, and put them out of business.
I absolutely loved this DVD. WCW and the WWE going to war with each other featured the absolute best time in profressional wrestling. The reason this DVD is so great, is because you get to hear from both Eric Bischoff and Vince McManon on their different strategies, as well as their feelings towards each other. Thrown in, is a lot of great footage from both RAW and Nitro, which includes tons of NWO footage, DX footage, the Vince/Austin feud, and much more. This DVD manages to cover the Monday Night war each step of the way to tell the complete story.
If you are a fan of professional wrestling, you need to buy this DVD. This is best wrestling documentary I have seen since ""Beyond the Mat"". The DVD is worth owning just for the extras themselves. There is 86 minutes of matches and events that were major to both WCW and the WWE.
A solid 5 stars...",1078012800,2,1584,4.446735395189004
1981595,4,B000199JKC,"Cause this is the one people.  The story about the MONDAY NIGHT WARS.  The trueth.  Every thing you wanted to know about the wars.  Youll hear few comments from wwe super stars like mick foley,big show and more.  The dvd was pretty good.  Its esspecially good for a wwe fan if you watch it back in the old days with hogan.  I really enjoyed and so should you.  Its not the greates but it is one of the best dvds of wwe out there.
The matches they showed in the extras was pretty good.
I wish they had shown the entrance for hogan and
Goldberg though.  But still it is well worth watching.
I didn't seem to like mcmahan saying crap about wcw on the
second half of the DVD though.  Whats up with that.  There were some twist and turns like when shane shocked the world about him and wcw.  It is a must own for any wcw fan.  Get and
now you can be there to witness THE MONDAY NIGHT WARS.
I give it a B+.  Good dvd to put in your collection.",1078012800,,937,3.9945945945945946
1981596,3,B000199JKC,I was disappointed.  The dvd was so hyped that it wasn't as good as they said it was.  The first half of it was good but when it came to the second half it just sucked.  The second half was pretty much Vince and his stooge Brisco say that WCW sucked and the WWF is 1000 times better and thats why they died.  The extras aren't that great either they could have been much better.  If you buy this don't have high expectations like I did.  Personally I thought that the NWO DVD was better.,1077926400,4,487,4.073684210526316
1981617,5,B000199JKC,"Thank god they are starting to actually use the WCW library.  Now while I agree with the rest by saying it should have been a 2/3 disc edition...but I'm not really going to complain.  This is an extremely interesting documentary about the WCW/WWE monday night wars from 96-2001.  I thought I knew everything there was to know about the monday night wars but after watching this there are things that I didn't even know.  I highly reccomend this, even if you think you know everything there is to know because it's extremely entertaining and you'll walk away with a different outlook at the whole situation.  After all the things Bischoff did, you can actually feel the fear in the voice of the announcers of the last Nitro.  A great DVD about a great period in sports entertainment!",1077840000,3,782,4.671532846715328
1981618,4,B000199JKC,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this DVD could have easily spanned two or even three discs.  I would have liked to see the entire final Nito prograsm as one of the ""extras.""  However, this disc brought back so many memories of the war.
I rememeber sitting in my easy chair on Monday nights flipping back and forth between Nitro and RAW.  I've watched the entire disc three times in the last two days, and pick up something new each time I view it.
I'd recommend this video to anyone.....those who lived through the war and those newer fans who've heard rumors about it.  The facts are now public record.
MARK",1077580800,2,614,4.455357142857143
1981619,3,B000199JKC,"I fondly remember the glory days of both WCW and the WWF, back when the ratings wars were going on. I was a hardcore WCW fan, but once Stone Cold stole the spotlight and became the icon of the ""sport"", I converted. However, in its day, WCW killed the WWF in ratings, and it was due in large part to STING. Yeah there are a few references here and there, but none in the time period from '96 to the end of '97 when WCW battled the NWO. All the credit for the WCW's success is giving directly to the NWO, when that is only half correct.
However, this DVD did feature the best Nitro match ever, in Goldberg vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan, and part of the best RAW match ever, in The Rock vs. Mankind. The two WWF full matches that were shown were somewhat lackluster, but the Benoit-Booker T match was part of a 4 out of 7 classic.
Overall, this DVD is good for the basic fan who never saw the war, but it tended to show a LOT more WWF than WCW, which could be understandable (all things considering). The Sting/NWO battle was the cream of the crop in WCW's heyday, and it was sadly omitted.",1077235200,13,1082,4.1571428571428575
1981620,5,B000199JKC,"Done documentary style, through interview clips with Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, and other wrestlers and backstage personnel, the saga of WWF/WWE vs. WCW is told.  The main documentary is worth it, as it goes in depth into the storylines that were used (Lugar showing up at the first NITRO, the ""Outsiders"" invasion of WCW and the creation of the nWo, D-X, the sketches with ""Nacho Man"", ""Billionaire Ted"" & ""The Huckster"", among others) to get the high ratings that the shows received.  The two things that I noticed which I didn't like were the references to ""WWE"" during the timeframes when it was ""WWF"" and the ""blurries"" over the ""F"" in the scratch logo era.
What's missing, and important in my opinion, was the ""return/invasion of the NWA"", which brought back the Midnight Express and LOD, and more of Jim Cornette's commentaries, of which only one is included in the extras.
It would have been nice to see more of the sketches in their entirety (unless they've got them as easter eggs), and more matches than just the ones listed.  A second disc of the full final WCW show and corresponding WWF show would have been a proper conclusion to this ""Monday Night War"".",1077148800,,1196,4.740384615384615
1981621,5,B000199JKC,"I was looking forward to buying this DVD from the moment it was announced to be released. And believe me, it didn't disappoint!!! The DVD reveals pretty much everything that happened during those exciting times. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the things that they recaptured, for example, when Vince McMahon was stunned those first few times by Austin, or when Shawn Michaels started the DX gimmick. Also, everyone who is interviewed in this presentation does not hesitate to tell exactly what they felt or went through. From the early days, to the NWO, to the Bret Hart ""screwjob,"" to the Attitude era, to the later days, and finally to the abrupt ending, this DVD covers it all. And the extras make this DVD all the more worth it. One of the best extras is the story of how DX went to Nitro on that little tank. That is priceless!!! Plus, there are four matches (2 from Raw and 2 from Nitro), Jim Cornette commentary, the story of how Rick Rude was on both shows the same night, the last Nitro, and much more!! If your deciding on what wrestling DVD to get next, it should be this one. I guarantee you will replay it over and over again!!!!",1077062400,,1149,4.476190476190476
1981622,3,B000199JKC,"Well, what can you say about this DVD? Everything, with the omittance of some things, that you ever wanted to know about the Monday Night Wars between the WWE and WCW is on this DVD. The story alone gives the DVD 3 1/2 stars. But the extras is what makes this DVD disappointing. ONE match in the extras section stands out and that's the Austin/HBK vs. Owen/Bulldog match. It's an excellent match and well worth your time seeing. The others, Goldberg vs. Hogan, Benoit vs. Booker T, and L.O.D. vs. HBK/HHH (???) or ok, but they are NOT classic material. This DVD SHOULD'VE been a 2-disc set, with the story (and a few extras within the chapters) being on disc 1 and the best matches in the history of Raw and Nitro being the second disc. Looking at the HUGE WWE video library, this DVD could've been so much better with the addtion of more extras. RAW and Nitro, during the course of the war, had many memorable moments. Too bad that most of them were left out. Overall, the story of the Monday Night War and the awesome tag team match from Raw make this DVD worthwhile. Otherwise, don't bother picking this up. If you desperately want to buy this, rent it or borrow it from a friend BEFORE you make your purchase.",1077062400,4,1213,4.419642857142857
1981623,5,B000199JKC,"I bought this dvd not knowing what i was in for. I have been watching wresting for ten years now and until i bought this dvd i was just in to this for the action,but what was behind the scenes is far more interesting.
This dvd all begins with the cold truth,mr. mcmahon was once a turner ally, having a wresting show on TBS. I am not going to spill all the facts beacuse every chapter takes twists and turns in everyway imaginable. It shows storylines heating up the rivalry
INCLUDING:
DX invading Nitro
Rick Rude on Raw AND Nitro the same Broadcasting Day
The END of Nitro
Bischoff calling out McMahon
AND so much more
With Raw and Nitro matches,including...
Raw:HBK and Stone cold vs. owen hart and british bulldog,D-X VS. Legion of doom
Nitro:Benoit vs. booker t, goldberg vs. hogan
This is a not-to-miss dvd. the fate of wresting was in the hands of these to companies and now the dvd to show it. PICK UP THE MONDAY NIGHT WAR",1076976000,,929,4.406976744186046

1981625,5,B000199JKC,"Before buying this dvd I heard mixed reviews of it.  Being the wrestling fan that I am I had to have it anyway.  It is truly an awesome disc.  You get a brief back story on each company's  origins but the meat of the meal is the coverage of the competition. You hear from the people who were there in front & behind the scenes in a very impartial & honest ""shoot"" about all the events from the beginning to the end.  Headlined by Vince McMahon & Eric Bischoff you hear all the tactics & low blows that made you want to watch.  You hear about the defections & talent raids.  You hear about all the real grudges & hard feelings from the people who were there.  Ric Flair, Jericho, Eddie, Rey, Big Show, etc all tell of the ups & downs of the greatest time in pro wrestling history.  Footage of some the greatest angle are included. The NWO, DX, Austin vs McMahon, etc All lend to the chronicles of the war.  If you are a wrestling fan who love to know it all, this is the dvd for you.  The extra's aren't much to speak of, but thats not what you're buying this for anyway. You want the dirt, the highs, the lows, & the stories.  Buy this dvd. You will now be dissapointed.
