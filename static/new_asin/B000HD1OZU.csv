8469961,2,B000HD1OZU,"I was able to borrow this video and the companion ""advanced"" video from my library.  Neither video is particularly well done, and there are only a couple of interesting drills in the advanced video.  Many of the people demonstrating the drills in the video are beginners and I found watching them make mistakes to be a bit distracting.  This video might be good for someone who has never played and just wants some very basic drills to try.  For those who are more serious I'd look into one of the Wiel Coerver videos.",1183161600,,518,4.537634408602151
