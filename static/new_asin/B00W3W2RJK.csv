7120065,5,B00W3W2RJK,Great movie. Frank Stone is such a unique character. The film takes a turn that you would not expect and you get drawn into his character and persona. Tom Sizemore's rambling is great and I loved the Artie Lange stuff as well. Great film!,1430006400,4,238,4.431818181818182
7120076,4,B00W3W2RJK,"Frank Stone (William Forsythe) recalls being abused growing up in an orphanage. He is socially awkward, quiet, and serious. He works for mobster Tough Tony (Victor Colicchio) as a second story man. He has no trouble killing anyone who gets in his way. Frank assumes an identify and takes a class in creative writing in order to meet Jackie  (Bianca Hunter) another troubled soul.

Frank lives in the 50's. His possessions are old but well kept. He even has his own 50's style crime theme music. The film takes off in a different direction after Frank has his strange epiphany. This is a different kind of crime thriller. It combines the old with the new through a disturbed mind. An interesting film.",1433635200,3,700,4.729508196721311

7120078,5,B00W3W2RJK,Loved this movie.  It was a dark comedy.  I liked the way William Forsythe's character progressed through the film. He's a great actor and he did a great job in this film with his transformation of the character.  The light comedy in it balanced the film very well.  Arte Lang at the end was great.,1433116800,5,298,4.363636363636363

7120080,5,B00W3W2RJK,"William Forsythe is an amazing actor, radiating charisma in every scene. The only comparisons I can think of are Brando in Streetcar and Waterfront. His malevolence is up there with the darkest Widmark and Palance. A must see film!",1432857600,4,231,4.948717948717949

7120085,3,B00W3W2RJK,Surprised at the acting the actors were a little off their marks an it was very surprising,1430611200,2,90,4.352941176470588
8712041,5,B00W3W2RJK,"Excellent movie about a man who is damaged from childhood and grows up to be a lonely hoodlum/killer working for the local mobster. He encounters a woman who is also very damaged and they strike up an unlikely relationship. The mobster kingpin eventually takes revenge on the hoodlum who he thinks is revealing his operations. But the hoodlum then goes for the payback. I don't want to give away any more of the plot. the acting is excellent from the leads to the smallest roles.
I watched the movie because I totally respect William Forsythe as an actor. That said, ALL of the roles were beautifully played.
Absolutely worth the cost of purchase.",1501632000,,647,4.734513274336283

8712045,3,B00W3W2RJK,I purchased this movie because I am facinated with Mob movies. The movie was good but could have been better.,1444867200,,109,4.5
8712046,4,B00W3W2RJK,"Good movie! It is kind of made into a time period 70's movie and William Forsythe ,(American Me) does not disappoint as the psychopathic sociopath Frank Stone who you do not want to mess around with even if your the organized crime people he works for. Tom Sizemore plays a creepy child molester who molds Frank Stone into what he is by his mistreatment he receives from Sizemore as a child. A whole lot of revenge killings makes this a good crime movie. Forsythe should team up with Javier Bardem and make a sequel to, No Country for Old Men, it would be one of best crime movies ever.",1436400000,,586,4.385321100917431
