5739811,1,B00CTQWK9W,Rarely do I review a bad film and give it a half a star. But this is like so bad... that I want help people. The acting is wooden and almost comes across like joke. The suppossidly special effects are bad even by today's amatuer computer standards. I felt like it was 1978 all over again and I wasn't even alive then. Please just avoid at all cost if you have to pay more than free for this. This is a very flat & lifeless film experence in every way not a enjoyable moment AT ALL. I feel for the people that were envolved I hope they can redeem themselves in the industry. Danny Trejo only had like 15 mins of screen time in the whole thing. Everything just felt like it was pasted in and feathered from a videogame. The director and writer actually appears in this muddled mess which obviously means he felt pretty positive about it. If you can see this for free and want to laugh please be my guest. This is defintley mystery science theater 3000 worthy at best. This should definitely be a lead film school example of what not to do.,1376179200,4,1037,4.242424242424242
5739812,1,B00CTQWK9W,"The film opens with a wonderful upskirt and camel toe we haven't seen since the likes of ""Poltergeist."" Danny Trejo is a priest performing an exorcism, which is not his long suit. Everyone dies, and so does the film. Trejo has a later cameo in a flashback. Another in a long list of film in which Trejo is billed far beyond his role.

Meanwhile young Jason is recruited by ""The Cloth"" because calling the film ""Exorcisms 'R' Us"" wouldn't sell. They are a secret Vatican God Squad who go around performing exorcisms. Lately, business has been picking up as all hell is about to break loose, similar to ""Ghost Busters"" but not as fun. Young girl chasing Jason (Kyler Willett) is the one who can save the world from the evil doers.

The plot isn't half bad, if they had stuck to the grindhouse music and style instead of invoking entertainment killing ""Lifetime"" dialogue. The acting was extremely poor with Lassiter Holmes, Kyler Willett, and Rachele Brooke Smith unable to deliver a line. Eric Roberts is a creepy looking priest. I liked the scene of Jason armed with a squirt gun filled with Holy Water, although they failed to make the rest of the film that entertaining. Think: Super-soaker.

And where do demons from hell go after you kill them? Detroit?

5739841,3,B00CTQWK9W,"I was fortunate enough to receive a review copy of this film to review.  My review may contain spoilers.  Here it is:

The Cloth is not your typical Horror movie with traditional exorcisms being performed throughout.  It provides a different twist as to how good fights against evil with different levels of weapons depending on the level of demon being fought.

Starring Danny Trejo and Eric Roberts, as well as a number of other B-movie actors, The Cloth falls just a bit flat of being an exceptional movie mainly due to the horrible CGI effects within the film; I really wanted to like this movie, but the cheesy graphics throughout the film took my attention away from the actual story line.  At one point, I noticed things completely disappear when they should have still been in the frame.

The Cloth starts out with a traditional exorcism being performed by Father Connley (Danny Trejo) and another priest.  There was a lot of promise for this film at this point because some disturbing images, blood, and gore were included in this part of the film, which was appropriate given the scene of the priests exorcising a demon.  As they have a hard time exorcising this demon, Father Connley dies during this struggle.

Jason (Kyler Willett) isn't really religious at all, so he really doesn't believe in god.  His family had been killed from an accident, so this was the reason why his faith had eventually waned.  Jason is recruited by the exorcists to help them fight against the demons because his father had been one and wanted him to follow in his footsteps.  Jason is reluctant at first, but he finally decides to join them in the fight.

Jason learns from the in-house historian Laurel (Perla Rodriguez) that the 5th Satan appears in human form and his name is Kasdeya (Justin Price).  He seeks people who have turned their back on god.  Once Kasdeya arrives, he has to return to his realm within seven days.  Basically, they don't want Kasdeya to take any lost souls with him.

Jason also learns about the weapons from their weapons specialist, Helix (Cameron White).  All the weapons are made from metals that were found in the Ark of the Covenant.  The level of weapon to be used is dependent upon which demon possesses a person as well.  Despite all of these new weapons, Father Diekmen (Lassiter Holmes) reminds Jason that the essential weapons are still holy water and crosses.

Jason finally goes out with Father Diekmen to fight some demons that are possessing people.  After a couple days of fighting, Jason decides to give up because he is sick of what he sees and being pushed around.  Laurel, the historian, eventually goes to Jason's place to convince him to come back, which Jason, eventually, agrees to.  Jason actually finds out later that Laurel was possessed at one point in her past and his father was the one who was able to save her.

The seventh and final night, Jason and Father Diekmen go out to find Kasdeya to kill him.  Kasdeya finally shows up and they have an exchange of words and a battle ensues; however, after all of this is done, there is a twist at the end of the film that I shall not reveal.

Despite the horrible graphics at times, there were actually some pretty promising graphics as well, but it just wasn't consistent enough throughout the whole movie to appreciate.  The music throughout the movie was actually very good and I was able to appreciate that, but I was a bit disappointed in the story line and how they killed the demons.  As the demons had been possessing people, it appears to defeat the demons; they are actually killing the people, or vessels, that the demons have taken over.  That was a hole in the story that I didn't really get, nor was it really explained in the film either.

Overall, The Cloth is not the worst movie I've seen, but it still needs a bit of help in order to get a higher rating from me.  It really seems like one of those cheesy SyFy Original movies that you see on TV.  With that being said, the film wasn't a waste of time either as there were some entertaining elements in it as well.  Overall, I give this film an average 3/5 star rating.  It's worth at least one look.

Overall rating:  3/5 stars

5739845,2,B00CTQWK9W,"I love a good religious horror or demon possession film. My background as a Christian gives me a certain appreciation for what many critics call hokey sensationalist cinema and B-movie trash. I've seen the good ones (""The Exorcist,"" ""Devil"") and I've seen the bad ones (""The Exorcist Tapes,"" ""The Last Exorcism Part II""). Unfortunately, Uncork'd Entertainment's ""The Cloth"" falls well below the threshold of bad and plunges into the abyss of laughably unwatchable.

Cases of demonic possessions are on the rise across the country. A faithless young man (Kyler Willett) is recruited by the Catholic Church into a secret organization of demon hunters. He teams up with a priest (Lassiter Holmes) as they track down the forces of evil and strive to put an end to Satan's stronghold on humankind.
I can only describe ""The Cloth"" as a horribly made Christian film clumsily fashioned together by mainstream independent movie producers devoid of any real religious slant who own an HD camera and iMovie program. Imagine graduates of Roman Polanski or William Friedkin's school of filmmaking being to blame for those ""Tribulation"" disasters and you get where I'm going with this. Its sexual content makes it pretty clear a Christian audience was not in mind while making the film.

Imagine an Asylum film completely devoid of the self-aware humor and wit we've come to expect from films like ""Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus"" or the more recent ""Sharknado."" ""The Cloth"" takes itself seriously all the way to the closing credits. This makes scenes of a priest shooting possessed people with a demon-killing gun as they explode into digitally animated pieces even harder to sit through. As hard as it is to believe, the CGI is worse than anything you've seen in any Asylum movie or SyFy Channel original movie.

The one character in the film that I found humorous and likable was the guy who provided the holy weapons to the two lead characters. If the movie was focused on him, it would've been a lot more enjoyable. His British accent and punk rock look and sensibilities added a level of fun to his scenes that the rest of the movie is sorely lacking. The guy wears t-shirts with slogans like ""Exorcise Regularly."" Need I go into any more explanation?

I will say that the scenes of demonic possession which aren't cluttered with bad CGI look good. Whoever did the makeup and practical effects deserve some applause for the most part. The exorcism scene at the beginning showed promise that the rest of the film couldn't deliver.

Danny Trejo is featured on the cover of ""The Cloth"" DVD as if he appears in the entire film. Be aware this is not the case. He is in what amounts to about 5 minutes of the 89-minute running time. Eric Roberts is also named as one of the main actors. He plays a priest and figures into maybe 5 minutes of screen time as well.

""The Cloth"" includes a few extra features. I'm not sure anyone will care after watching it. There are two featurettes entitled ""Making of 'The Cloth'"" and ""Weapons of 'The Cloth.'"" Deleted and alternate scenes are also found. We're blessed with a music video for the song ""Hell and Back"" as well.

As much as I hate saying this about any movie, ""The Cloth"" has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's a haphazard attempt at combining the elements of much better films like ""Constantine"" and ""End of Days."" I hope Danny Trejo and Eric Roberts were paid well enough to justify them wasting their time and talents on this drivel.",1377561600,,3473,4.778333333333333
8586159,1,B00CTQWK9W,"really bad. The acting is beyond bad, even for a horror b-movie",1527292800,,63,4.333333333333333
8586160,1,B00CTQWK9W,Horrible film.,1500854400,,14,6.5
8586161,1,B00CTQWK9W,"I like how the Cloth tells its story by naming religious people/demons and talks about characters we've never heard of and yet, continues telling the story like we're supposed to know who these demons and people are!  This is mainly because the character of Laurel is in her own little religious-obsessed world reading up on the demons that have invaded this church, and while in this little world, her explanation for the evil that lurks the church and city never makes sense.

To make the story even more confusing, the film relies heavily on special effects.  We see these special effects often between scenes, and it adds to the confusion instead of adding to the story. To make the Cloth even worse (which is hard to believe that's possible) the killings happen in a way that makes everything look Matrix-like and exaggerated.  The Cloth is action mixed with horror, which is a deadly combination.  The way guns and knives are used is hilariously exaggerated, as are the characters who at first all seem like regular people obsessed with learning about the demonic activity going on, but later reveal they have amazing fighting skills when confronted by demons.  These skills are treated as normal.  All this adds up to an unintentional comedy.

Just for fun let's try to make sense of this shall we?

In church, a character named Laurel and this preacher guy (who's actually an experienced fighter) mention to the character of Jason that the Cloth's main objective is to seek and destroy those who'd do harm to the balance of good and evil from within.  Once a person becomes possessed their soul no longer exists in this realm.  Once Castia arrives (whoever that is) the possessed person has seven days until he returns to his realm.  It is very important he doesn't take any lost souls with him.

Jason is the star of this movie.  He's a teenager, as is Laurel.  He says to Laurel ""What's the point of all this saving the world stuff if you can't feel alive in it.  Everyone dies but not everyone lives!""  Jason is like me- we grow tired of Laurel's religious talk.  A man in the church basement shoots a guy (or something else) and says the bullet burst into projectile form.  He continues that the combustion chamber consists of holy water and fusion equipment manufactured underneath the church.  Holy water and crosses are still the most important essentials.  Well I'm lost!  Shortly after we see a half female/half man beast walking around in the church basement.  Maybe something good's going to happen now?  Nah!

Now the story gets a whole lot more confusing.  Read on!

We see a black dude crawling in bed with women who like each other.  When he crawls under the covers he suddenly turns into a vampire.  After this the preacher guy reveals he's tough and can handle his weapons.  It's not actually said he has enhanced powers- more like we're supposed to go along with it and be able to follow along to his confusing character.  This adds to the humor in a big way!  Anyway he says ""Something isn't right here"" while he and Jason head into a warehouse.  Jason and the preacher throw grenades at enemies. When a demon appears at the front gate it makes the preacher cough up blood, then blows Jason's back against the wall.  The monster approaches Jason with a giant eel thing sticking out of his mouth.  The preacher blows him away.

The one scary moment of the movie comes up soon after.  The preacher and Jason have a conversation with an old man outside his home when suddenly the man blows backwards.  Jason and the preacher walk inside and see a man with a worm or eel crawling out of his mouth and the daughter zooming out of bed and climbing the walls in a demonic voice.  The way the daughter moves around is definitely scary- the only scary moment of this otherwise unintentional comedy.  This scene makes no sense though.  I wouldn't expect it any other way!

The characters speak to each other again.  Jason's father did everything he could to protect Jason and his family.  If they don't stop the demon now everything they fought for will be lost.  In the confessional a black man says he has eliminated the cloth.  The priest says it's a violation of the pact.  A moment later the priest has a nose bleed and coughs up coins.  Just then the confessional explodes as the black man walks away.  Hey wait, don't leave.  I'd like to be made of money too!

We now see a woman scrubbing a floor while Jason brushes his teeth.  She walks up to him and spits toothpaste fluid at his forehead.  In a demonic voice she says she will show Jason true desire and that darkness will conceal her.  She grabs Jason by the throat before Jason throws holy water at her body.  She falls over and shatters like ice.  Jason shows off his muscled chest as he lets Laurel into his home.  Bad idea.  She's probably going to religious talk you to death Jason!  She looks at the marking on his back wall and says that Castia is only one piece of the puzzle and that Beezlebub is trying to bring his hell with them.  Laurel asks Jason to talk about the accident.  What accident?  Jason mentions someone he knew lost control of the wheel.  She says the only church that exists lies within and that hell is coming to earth while Jason's too busy living in his own to realize it.  Jason can't forgive Eddie because he was the one driving the truck in that accident.

Jason drops by Eddie's house and sees his eyes glowing.  This frightens him.  A priest says Jason's father saw the good in everyone, even Laurel, and didn't want to terminate somebody's child.  Whose child?  The battle of good and evil will be won and the only battle that ever raged was within.  This is a touching moment between Laurel and Jason.  Huh, pardon me for not being touched as well.  Jason picks up a gun and travels to a bar.  A bouncer explodes while punching a window.  Jason takes a cross attached to a chain and swings it through someone's throat.  Meanwhile his partner (that preacher with amazing skills!) snaps a bad guy's neck after grabbing the side of his head.  Jason fights a woman who has a black eel in her mouth.  Jason shoots her but it's too late- something happens to the preacher and he's lying in blood.  Before dying the preacher says ""Jason, this is more important than you know.  You must protect her"".  Protect who?

Afterwards someone walks into the room clapping his hands.  Jason utters religious words in a different language but the monster says it's too late for that.  The monster thanks Jason for providing the very thing he needed all along.  Too bad he doesn't say what that thing is so we'll just assume it's peanut butter.  He wants to taste sweet Laurel.  The monster says to Jason ""How does it feel to know everyone you know will be serving me in hell?""  Luckily Jason jumps up shooting at the monster with more religious words (and reading some reviews apparently all the religious talk going on throughout the movie is completely fake- nice job writers for making the Cloth even worse!).  The monster says he will fail.  While in a cave or the church basement Laurel encounters a helium voiced female monster.  I think it's the same half female/half male monster we see in the basement early on.  It grabs Laurel and says she'll soon be free to leave this realm... but you'll never be free to leave this poor movie, har har har!

Jason talks to a young man who says Laurel has been taken by someone named Nievis.  Nievis is planning a crossover and wants to use Laurel as the final gateway.  Jason mentions they killed Castia so this can't be possible, but the young man says Castia was just a distraction.  Jason and this man discuss a plan.  As he thinks Jason's going to do something to harm him, just then Jason tosses mist and makes the young man pass out on the floor.  I never could figure out who this young man was.  If he's a priest, he's the most unbelievable priest ever.  Anyway Jason visits Eddie.  Jason brings a squirt gun filled with holy water.  He shoots the gun at Eddie and says he has some good news- he's not going to kill Eddie.  Another priest tells Jason that he has to take control of his life.

Jason disappears as the young man/priest (whoever he is) that Jason threw mist at earlier fights that bouncer who broke the glass window back at the bar.  The young man does a Mortal Kombat spin attack and destroys the bouncer to pieces.  Jason wakes up in a dark cave with monsters flashing their teeth at him.  He's surrounded by this mysterious evil.  A priest down here wakes up and says the crossover is complete.  The priest says something important about this church's existence, but all I can understand is that this church is where people practice their faith.  The more important message is mumbled.

Laurel is down here in the basement.  She wakes up asking Jason if he misses her.  Her eyes aren't normal so she's demonic.  Maybe now she'll stop talking all that religious mumbo jumbo.  Oh no, even as a demon she won't stop talking.  Laurel says Jason is a pathetic soul and says she will have her revenge.  Jason says ""Let Laurel go!"" in the quietest way ever.  The demon inside Laurel says ""Your girlfriend is in good hands"".  She makes the ceiling shake as a second demon takes advantage of the opportunity by attacking Jason.  Jason quickly shoots it down.  Jason grabs Laurel's forehead but she's stronger and strangles him.  He says religious stuff to the demon inside Laurel while the priest speaks and makes himself explode.  Nice skeleton!  Laurel's back to normal and asks Jason if it's over.  He says ""I think so"".

It's not over yet.  Somebody fires a bullet at a rock on the ground.  The man says Jason's never had a big boy weapon before.  He mentions the X mark, which is a symbol of the cloth.  Oh, this man isn't a demon.  He's just a regular man arguing with Jason as the three of them walk up the stairs and leave the church basement.  As they walk away we continue to see the basement.  A cloth floats up to the camera with a message that says ""I am the way you are this way"".  The message nicely sums up the whole movie- it's confusing.  The end.

Nothing at all makes sense about the Cloth.  Nothing.  At least the closing credits has a good theme song.  It's the same song we hear early on and it's still terrific.  It's a hard rock guitar riff with chanting.  I like this, and only this.  The rest of the movie is poor in every single way.",1500422400,,10423,4.5195920558239395

8586163,1,B00CTQWK9W,"This was complete garbage.  But hey I made it 25 minutes.  That 25 minutes was full of horrible graphics (think laggy powerpoint transitions), mono-tone and echoing dialect.  Its like they filmed it, played it for themselves, filmed the playing of it, and said ok this works.  There's a female in it that is well on her way to becoming the latino Kirsten Stewart (Kristen Stewart... who cares she cant act anyway)  They did have the horror basics and cohesion though.
Takes place in TX, shows actual texas plates, and registration stickers.  El Paso sign, all that jazz.  Keep in mind i only lasted 25 minutes.
Horror basics, alcohol, sexual advances, and atractive actors/actress' that you just know are going to get hurt and or die.
Not for kids.  Theres two sex scenes and a killing scene within the first 25.",1493769600,2,812,4.75
8586164,1,B00CTQWK9W,Worse acting and dialogue I have ever seen.  I can only imagine it was self paid by the writer as no producer would want his name placed on this garbage.  Don't waste your time!!!  it's really that bad!!!,1490832000,,204,4.315789473684211
8586165,1,B00CTQWK9W,less than I expected. I was looking for an excorcist type movie. They chose an unusual angle to the plot and didn't pull it off that well. probable Ok to watch as a second movie for the night.,1486166400,,192,4.078947368421052
8586166,1,B00CTQWK9W,This is a really awful movie.  Don't bother,1485820800,,43,4.375
8586167,2,B00CTQWK9W,"This was a silly movie. The whole story line was silly and not believable. The biblical references were gibberish and untrue. One character eating a host and drinking wine like it was a snack was sacrilegious and stupid.  The portrayal of the priests was over the top and stereotypical. The main character ""Jason"" was a horrible actor for the part as a demon killer. He looked totally lost in his role and his actions were comical at best. I did find the women demonic possessions okay with good special effects. Eric Roberts and Danny Trejo as priests were comical and a waste. There were action sequences but they were poorly done. The camera work was shaky and you can see editing was done because it seemed like some scenes were cut out as the picture faded at times throughout the film. This made the movie appear choppy without an even flow to the action. I would not recommend this movie.",1483747200,3,895,4.59375
