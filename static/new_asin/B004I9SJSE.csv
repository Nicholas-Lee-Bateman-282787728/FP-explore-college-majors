8430469,5,B004I9SJSE,"I loved this collection. FINALLY I can get all the long LOST episodes of the Incredible Hulk from my childhood. I remember when it aired on NBC every Saturday morning. I would get up and watch this show which was paired with Spider-Man. Then Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends. 1980's GOODNESS right here.

But let's get specific. THIS release is one of a kind. It will NEVER be released in USA and they did a great job of transferring the original master recordings into HD DVD format. This looks BETTER than it did when it aired. Because in 1980's we all had antennas for reception so good luck getting a clear picture back then. But now it looks fantastic. And you can't find this anywhere else, I've LOOKED. The youtube clips of this show are inferior quality. There is NO bootlegs of this either, maybe some inferior quality ripped from a tv show, but nothing like THIS. This set of 2 discs is the real deal. Official Marvel release and IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES! It's crazy how many languages it has on it. Not just English but Ukrainian,Spanish,dutch,french,german,portugese it's all there in either subtitle or audio form or both. This came in handy for our house we have two bilingual adopted children that watch this is both English,Spanish,and Ukrainian.

There are a total of 13 episodes. 13 episodes is the standard length of 1 season of any animated series. That's all that was ever produced for this show and it was so successful even off the re-runs that they never had to produce any more.

The Fact that this DVD is region 2 was NOT a problem at all. I never use a DVD player anymore. I just use my PC and a little free program called VLC media player, it just plays ANY DVD I put in there. I have a 32"" LED HD TV  connected through HDMI to my PC and I watch this in 16:9 Format every SATURDAY! I hope to add more classic toons to my collection.
The price is a bit hefty because it's an import but I was lucky enough to snag one up used.
If you see one like that and your a Hulk fan, or 80's Fan, or Super Hero fan, I'd grab it. Esp. since this series is Out of Print, so they won't be producing any more of these discs.

My final thought is I wish they extras, like interviews, or art gallery, or scripts, but really I can't complain because what more can you ask for then a superb HD quality restoration of a classic show like this?",1412121600,6,2348,4.351598173515982

8430471,5,B004I9SJSE,ok!!!,1405209600,3,5,5.0
8430472,4,B004I9SJSE,I give this set a four out of five because it is not on DVD in the United States and Canada.  When it is released on Region one DVDs then I will give this set a five out of five.  Please hurry and put out a region one set of The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Animated Collection.
