8281178,5,B001B1873Y,I enjoy these old school horror flicks. This did not disappoint!,1435968000,2,64,4.909090909090909

8281180,3,B001B1873Y,"I thought that getting three movies for the price of one was a good deal, but two of the movies aren't worth watching.  ""Alien"" of course is the best of the lot.  Sigourney Weaver can't be beat in that one.  I had originally planned to order it, but thought I'd get more bang for my buck by getting three.  I was wrong.",1412985600,,319,4.096774193548387
8281181,5,B001B1873Y,"I know nothing about aspect ratios or formatting, nor do I care.  I was looking for Lifeforce on DVD and found this one with the bonus of two more movies!  Looks just fine on my T.V.",1403308800,4,182,4.027777777777778
8281182,4,B001B1873Y,"This is not a high-def suite of films, mainly because the originals pre-date that technology. The collection is of good quality and was shipped very rapidly by the vendor.",1380412800,,171,4.931034482758621
8281183,3,B001B1873Y,to the guy complaining about the black bars on Alien. the original aspect ratio for Alien IS 2.20 : 1 WHICH MEANS YOU WILL HAVE BLACK BARS ON THE TOP A BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN EVEN IF YOU HAVE A WIDE SCREEN TV.,1349222400,3,208,3.86046511627907
8281184,1,B001B1873Y,"Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers are anamorphic in format.  That's good.  They have the same aspect ratio as the theatrical releases and they ""expand"" to fill as much of the screen of your TV as possible while maintaining that ratio.  But, Lifeforce, listed as ""Widescreen"" is in letterbox format.  You won't notice this on the old style TV, but if you have a widescreen TV, the image will be pretty small with MOST of the screen black.  Indeed, black on all four sides.  I bought this set to replace a prior copy of Lifeforce in the same letterbox format.  This seems to be a repackaging of that old release.  Shame on you MGM.  I avoid buying your products for this very reason.",1344297600,9,688,4.483870967741935
8281185,3,B001B1873Y,"Well, I thought I had finally found Alien in the 185:1 aspect ration, in which this DVD is advertised.  However that only applies to the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  The other two movies are in aspect ration 235:1.  I know it shouldn't but those black lines bother me, when I have a 16X9 high def flat screen TV.  Seems to me wide screen should be wide screen without those irritating black lines, when you have a wide screen TV.  But that's just my pet peeve.  Bottom line, the information provided here is incorrect for 2 of the 3 movies in this set.",1233187200,7,556,4.349514563106796
