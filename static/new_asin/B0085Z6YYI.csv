5133954,5,B0085Z6YYI,We were absolutely thrilled to watch these old Carol Burnett shows.  Having a copy on a disc now means we can enjoy them again and again.,1355184000,,137,4.269230769230769
5133955,3,B0085Z6YYI,Product had a few glitches but the main thing is it did not have closed caption for people with hearing difficulties.,1355097600,,117,4.619047619047619
5133956,5,B0085Z6YYI,"Lots of fun and very enjoyable for anyone who enjoyed the Carol Burnett Show!  And if you didn't watch the show, now's your chance.",1354406400,7,131,4.458333333333333
5133957,5,B0085Z6YYI,What can you say about Carol. You just love her and her show. Never missed one on TV. Her cast was the best. Can't wait to get family together and have some good laughs,1354320000,,168,3.9705882352941178
5133958,5,B0085Z6YYI,"I bought 2 sets of these DVDs.  One for my dad and one for my brother.  We grew up with the Carol Burnett show, and she is hysterical.  These make excellent gifts for all Carol Burnett fans.",1353974400,3,190,4.081081081081081
5133959,5,B0085Z6YYI,This is a great dvd. If you like Carol Burnette it is a must. Very funny. She is such a great actor.,1353801600,,100,3.590909090909091
5133960,2,B0085Z6YYI,"This does not contain the truly memorable sketches that I thought it would.  If you are an ""original"" Carol Burnett fan and viewer of her variety shows, go for the 6 DVD set it has the most cherished and most-oft shown classic comedy shows you remember with reverance.

If you just want to experience a much shorter collection to see if you want to view more, then this 2 set may be OK for you.  Just take care to read the reviews very carefully!",1352764800,87,446,4.285714285714286
5133961,5,B0085Z6YYI,This DVD was given to my 76 y/o father and his 85 y/o girlfriend. We laughed so hard that I thought they would both have a heart attack! I almost forgot what real comedy was. This DVD was a refreshing relief from the usual profanity-laced comedy of today.,1352764800,23,255,4.333333333333333
5133962,5,B0085Z6YYI,Still funny all these years later. Timeless. What a troupe of players led by Carol. Will watch again and again.,1351728000,3,111,4.6
5133963,5,B0085Z6YYI,"Awesome DVD set!  We watched during our Thanksgiving ""after Dinner"" activity.  We sat, watched and reminisced about the good old days when we used to watch the show as kids.  Great add to any family get together!!!!!!",1351123200,3,217,4.8108108108108105

5133975,4,B0085Z6YYI,"Three excellent shows broadcast during the Christmas season. However, the shows are not all Christmas oriented. Only a few skits/sketches during each show are Christmas involved with the rest being excellent Carol Burnett presentations. If you are looking for an all Christmas tribute you will be in for a disappointment. However, if you are true Carol Burnett fan you will love it.",1513814400,,382,5.17741935483871
5133976,4,B0085Z6YYI,"I see amazon has for some reason lumped together reviews for several different DVDs under the reviews for this new DVD ""Carol's Lost Christmas"". This DVD was released in October 2017 so any review dated prior to then is not about this specific DVD.

Great to see these shows. I like the 1969 Christmas show the best of the three, with Carol's old ""boss"" Garry Moore and co-star Durwood Kirby, a good performance by the Mitchell Boys choir, and a fun segment of Harvey Kormann impersonating/singing as Tom Jones. The ""Carol and Sis"" segment is also fun. I liked the 1970 show the least of the three, which began with a production number by the singers and dancers all dressed as Santa Claus. The ""Goldman's Boy"" movie spoof to me was boring, runs long and has nothing to do with Christmas.

I am very glad that these shows are finally available. Or, most of the shows, anyway.

A couple complaints, one of which is that considering these shows are being promoted as ""uncut"", at least one show is definitely cut. There must have been a Dickens or Scrooge segment closing out the 1970 show, which has been removed. The ""Goldman's Boy"" segment ends and then suddenly the whole cast appears in full Dickens-era costumes for the closing of the show, with background scenery to match. A segment of the show (which included songs from the ""new"" musical movie, ""Scrooge"") was cut out.

Another complaint is that the volume is extremely loud. I put this in after watching some other TV programs and DVDs, and was startled by the high volume and grabbed for the remote as fast as I could.

I feel cheated by the Dickens segment being removed, but overall I am glad that these shows are available as I enjoyed them a lot.",1509580800,3,1709,4.590163934426229
5133977,5,B0085Z6YYI,"The Carol Burnett Show: Carols Lost Christmas contains three episodes from the first four seasons of The Carol Burnett Show, which ran from 1967 to 1978. The variety show featured sketch comedy, song and dance, and an assortment of funny characters. Carols ensemble cast consisted of Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence and Lyle Waggoner, and later Tim Conway. Each year, Carol and company would present a Christmas show.

In this collection, Jonathan Winters appears as Santa Claus with an odd collection of dolls. There are dancing Santas, Christmas carols, yuletide poetry and a visit to a tipsy Kris Kringle at the North Pole in Carols very first Christmas show. Carol and Vicki join the Bob Mitchell Singing Boys for a performance of Do You Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown? And there are the classic sketches The Old Folks, Carol and Sis,  V.I.P., and The Charwoman.

A highlight in the collection is the Mrs. Peter Piper courtroom sketch with Garry Moore and Durward Kirby, written by Neil Simon and first performed on The Garry Moore Show.

The shows are presented in their entirety, unlike TV re-runs, which were broken up into half-hour segments for syndication. The three shows on this DVD are shown exactly as aired originally. The comedy holds up remarkably well after all these years, but along with genuine wit and sharp writing, theres the nostalgia of reliving many a Saturday night watching The Carol Burnett Show, including her always amusing trademark opening chat with the audience. With variety shows virtually absent from TV screens these days, its pleasant to see these shows again. The skits, movie parodies, guest stars, and music contributed to a great hour of entertainment.",1508889600,2,1698,5.053571428571429
5133978,4,B0085Z6YYI,"I would have given this a 5 star review, one of the 3 episodes has a whole segment edited out.

5133979,2,B0085Z6YYI,"I was pretty disappointed with this. I did not expect to have inserts of discussions about the shows. The episodes they picked weren't the best. On the positive side, it does have the ""Went with the Wind"" skit (famous for Carol coming down the stairs). It does show the beginning of the show where Carol talks to the audience -- my favorite -- but I have seen much better ones than the ones included here. Someone mentioned Tim Conway. I love him too. You can find the famous skit of Tim Conway as the old fireman on You Tube. For the cost, I believe I should have gotten an entire season. I would much rather buy that than this. It is not favorites but two shows start to finish. Good to have the entire show, but as I said I should have gotten the whole season.",1501718400,,763,4.232876712328767

5134038,4,B0085Z6YYI,It's interesting to notice how our response of trigger to humor has changed over the years.  The Carol Burnett Show was indeed a rib tickler from earlier days.  Good clean humor without potty humor or sexual innuendo.  Broadway level entertainment for those who could not afford luxurious or box office seats.  Well balanced comedy that was culturally sensitive and appealing to the whole family.  Highly recommended for those 25 and older or for families.,1438300800,3,456,5.108108108108108

What I really dislike about this set is this disk is part of the ""This Time Together"" collection. There are so many of these one or two disk sets out there and all of them are marketed with the same wording on the package. It appears that all of them are part of one of the 7 or 8 disk sets, but I bought one of these single disks recently and it was not. It is just too confusing to figure out. You won't know if it is part of one of the larger 7 or 8 disk sets until you open it and look for the disk number. The disk number should be listed on the outside packaging. So I wasted 20+ dollars on this disk when I already have it. I bought it because it said ""bonus episodes"". The content and quality are fine. Love Carol and the crew. I rated it based on content, not my feelings about the poor labeling.",1420675200,,916,3.877659574468085

From the days of endless variety shows, The Carol Burnett Show stood out from the rest. She set the benchmark every season then raised the bar too. Some of the best variety and sketch writing, along with ensemble performances can be found here. I purchased this as a gift and found myself laughing out loud, reliving those early years when variety was king...or queen, rather. This show has stood the test of time and many of the sketches are just as fresh as they were when first performed back in the early 70's. These are full length episodes, not best of. You see the good and the bad as they were originally presented. Some sketches are way too long, but that's okay, and other sketches are simply ridiculous, and that's okay too.

It brought about a weak smile a couple of times but that is all. It was not funny, seemed long a drawn out.  I have put it away...won't be watching it again.  No good episodes here.",1400976000,,314,3.9206349206349205

5134096,5,B0085Z6YYI,"Carol Burnett is amazing, as well as timeless. She generously surrounds herself with top-notch talent who play off each other magically. From the very beginning, I found myself anticipating the moment they would break each other up. Priceless entertainment.",1399161600,,257,5.615384615384615

5134098,1,B0085Z6YYI,I thought this would be the best of the Carol Burnett Show - a favorite of ours growing up - but it was dumb and boring. We turned it off halfway through and haven't touched it since. Very disappointed.,1395014400,,202,4.205128205128205
5134099,1,B0085Z6YYI,"I loved the Carol Burnett Show when I was a kid and wanted to buy some of her shows on DVD.  It was never very clear how many shows were on this DVD but I ordered it anyway.  I foolishly thought that it may have a season or most of a season or at least a dozen shows but no, it only has three shows on one DVD disc.  They are about 40 minutes each so that is not a very good return on my ""investment.""  There are a couple of interviews with the performers that were interesting but still, not much.  There was no ""blooper reel"" or any other extra.  Bottom line, forget this.  I would buy a DVD that has a season of shows on it but not another one like this.  By the way, the title is ""Carol's Favorites"" but I kind of doubt that - these were pretty mundane shows, none of the three were the kind of show that people remembered from the old days, certainly nothing to ""write home about.""",1394582400,16,886,3.9943181818181817

I searched for episode info to prevent getting duplicate episodes, there was no such info available. Upon receiving the bundle I learned that the 2 extra set were ALL same shows as in yellow set. When I returned blue and pink sets, I got less than 50% refund...$6 for one and $4 for the other. If amazon and sellers offer DVD bundles they should at least make darn sure there are no duplicate episodes.
