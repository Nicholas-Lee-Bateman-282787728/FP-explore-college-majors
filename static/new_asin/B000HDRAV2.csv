Remember when Theo Huxtable thought he could listen to an LP of ""MacBeth"" rather than reading Shakespeare's work on ""The Cosby Show""?  It didn't work because he couldn't understand the 17th-century English being spoken.  However, I think this documentary could help high school students who are about to be tested on this period in English history.

This was not an easily divisible schism where Yoda and the Emperor are diametric opposites.  This work spoke of divisions between Protestants and Catholics, but it was really a division between Catholics, Anglicans, and Puritans.  It was the Continent vs. England vs. Scotland.  It reminded me that absolute monarchy did not exist in Britain as it may have in France.  For people who have become fascinated by Marie Antoinette due to S. Coppola's film, they may enjoy this work as it shows what happens when royalty loses the support of its people.  It shows how powerful people can be incredibly naive.  (Why hadn't King Charles read Machiavelli's ""The Prince""?)

Just as Marie Antoinette was a flawed figure, so was this King.  The work emphasizes that not only did he make huge mistakes, but he also suffered from being indecisive.  Then it goes further and explains how he was a liar.  He bargained with Parliament, but would write letters to his wife admitting that he had no intention of working jointly with them.  We do have rampant identity theft now, but it was hard to watch this and not think any person who hand a letter to a carrier for someone else in another country sure is stupid if he thinks no one can read the letter or intercept it.

There are paintings here, but otherwise this is entirely done from reenactments.  I've noticed that many creative anachronism groups on American college campus only dress in clothes from the Renaissance and Medieval times.  People like that may love this documentary as it is filled with gigantic hats, puffy pants, and long, curly hair for days.  Still, the actor playing King Charles has the phoniest mustache and goatee ever recorded.  In the same way that the Simpsons family always wears the same outfit, the actor here never changes outfits.  Yes, it would be difficult for documentary makers to find the budget to give actors more than one outfit.  Still, I'm quite sure that royalty had all kinds of clothes in their wardrobe.  The monotony of this king's dress did stand out.  Also, they show his executor making a chop, the narrator said it just took one blow to kill him, and yet there was no fake blood on the ax.

I hate to be Americo-centric, but this left me with unanswered questions.  Admittedly, this was a British production meant for a British audience.  But as an American viewer, I kept wondering, ""And how did these facts influence America?""  Americans wouldn't fight with Britain until more than a century later.  This work shows Britain having a civil war centuries before the US had one.  It was implied that Puritans were the most dissatisfied denomination, so maybe that's why US history books say they were willing to travel to North America.  Still, ""the New World"" is never brought up and as an American I found that conspicuous.",1210982400,,3206,4.827522935779816
8138957,4,B000HDRAV2,"Overall, this is a fair look at an extremely controversial monarch. Though it is a little harsh at times in my opinion, sometimes the truth does hurt. It tells about King Charles I, the second British sovereign of the House of Stuart from his early youth as a weak and sickly prince living in the shadow of his older brother Henry to his execution by the rebelling forces of parliament. He is both a kind man, devoted father & husband, and a despotic absolute monarch. This film covers both the good and bad aspects of his character which ultimately ended in civil war and gave him the distinction of being the only British monarch to be formally executed for fighting his own people.",991612800,,684,4.569105691056911
