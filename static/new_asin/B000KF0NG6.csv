8156158,5,B000KF0NG6,"I saw the movie, Station Jim, and thought it was such a great movie that I had to have a copy of it.  The price I payed for it at Amazon.com was great and the delivery time was fantastic.  Thanks.",1235865600,,196,3.875
8156159,5,B000KF0NG6,"After seeing this movie on television, I ordered copies for my grandchildren.  It is so delightful.",1211846400,4,99,5.1875
8156160,4,B000KF0NG6,"This was a sweet movie but it wasn't about Station Jim, the dog!  It was really about Bob, a train station employee and his inner struggles to be who he wanted to be, have the courage he wanted to have and get the girl he wanted to get.  There's nothing wrong with that and it was nicely filmed but it wasn't about the dog!",1193270400,9,323,4.03125
8156161,3,B000KF0NG6,"As a Jack Russell owner I would have enjoyed a lot more time with the dog...  The movie begins with the plucky little dog being threatened by his drunken, rifle wielding owner.  Not a great beginning for smaller children but not as bad as when the woman who runs the orphanage (also drunk) sets it on fire and ends up terribly burned (later to die from her injuries).  While all bad guys get their comeuppance and all good guys get the girl,the stationmaster's position, or whatever their appropriate reward as is fitting in a Victorian melodrama, it still wasn't that engaging.",1185408000,4,578,4.702970297029703
8156162,5,B000KF0NG6,"This is another charming British BBC film in the same genre as 'Goodnight Mr. Tom' and 'An Angel for May' that is certainly suitable for ALL ages.

With a cast of notable British character actors, including George Cole, Prunella Scales (as Queen Victoria), Timothy West and Frank Finlay, one can't help but be mesmerised by the simple, yet exciting story of a small dog who is found abandoned and then adopted by a village railway porter in the Victorian age of Great Britain.  There's drama too, with an orphanage fire and an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria, but needless to say the dog saves the day.

Lots of terrific train shots for steam train enthusiasts to drool over.  The anamorphic 16x9 transfer (not even mentioned on the DVD cover) is exceptional.

As the cover liner notes say, "" . . . a heart-warming adventure of determination, hope, love and loyalty."" (Something we could all embrace in today's dysfunctional world).  Add this to you DVD library if you want 90 minutes of real entertainment!",1176336000,17,1015,4.838150289017341
