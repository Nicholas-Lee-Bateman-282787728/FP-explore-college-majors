7911095,3,B00000INDI,"I saw this movie in 1972 at the local AMC Theater's Summer Morning Movie program for children. For CHILDREN! This movie scared the heck out of me. I was 12 and I had nightmares for a month thanks to this movie.

It is a space race between the US and Russia on who can land on Mars first. Darren McGavin is the commander on the US Ship. I mostly remember a Russian Cosmonaut floating in space, and the US crew recovering him. I remember they land on Mars and there is this large glowing orb that talks and entices people to come to it. Once there it opens up, sucks the person in and spit out a charred body. I ran out of the theater I was so frightened by this. To this day I can't watch the full movie and I have never forgotten it. My reasons for nightmares may have gotten more grown up, but this one still makes me squeamish.",1450224000,,829,4.085889570552148
