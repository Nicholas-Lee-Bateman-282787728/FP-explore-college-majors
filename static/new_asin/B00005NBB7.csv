8372857,5,B00005NBB7,"a very good dubbed tape one of the best out especially for new fans This tape is where the fight begins and krillin fights bacterian(the only contestant who has never bathed in his life and rght before krillin passes out goku points out that... well I can't tell you though most of you know but some of bacterians attacks are hilarious and somewhat sick(hehe you guys know the attack im talking about, well if ure a japanese fan you do) I would reccomend this tape and both others although the side box art is lame goku has his hands on his stomach and is stuffed. so if you are a dragonball fan get this tape! and if you are a trunks fan pre-order the box set! and beware I wouldn't buy the first 6 tapes if I were you there untolerable. well cya",996278400,,747,4.230769230769231
