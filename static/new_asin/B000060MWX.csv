7957604,1,B000060MWX,"A REFORMED GANG MEMBER [CHYNA] SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST HIS FORMER GANG, WHO BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE AND KILLED HIS SISTER AND HIS MOTHER. WHAT A WASTE. CHYNA [NOT THE FORMER WWE WRESTLER] IS SIMPLY BORING TO WATCH. KIND OF LIKE ''COMMANDO'', JUST WITHOUT THE EXCITEMENT. MACK 10 IS A VERY GOOD RAPPER, BUT HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ACT. THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A POORLY MADE HOOD MOVIE. DON'T PICK THIS MOVIE UP. IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY.",1070323200,,456,4.440476190476191
7957605,4,B000060MWX,"With rather inexperienced lead actors like  Chyna (Fishburne's stunt double in the matrix and Rapper Mack 10, I was a bit skeptical. A pleasant surprise was the plot which revolves around a tough gangster trying to get out of his gang The Platinum Playaz"" Chyna provides the renegade force, a bit of Rambo, Robocop, and Terminator (although not a cyborg). The characters are fairly well though out and the action is tight, although could have benefited from longer fight scenes as opposed to the fast cuts between fights. The movie was well choreographed and the fighting looked fairly cool.
Mack 10 is a cool mellow customer with a quiet intensity, but a bit of underlying humor. He was in command as the chief bad guy especially when he had his henchmen (em Henchwomen) tune up an unlucky thug. Yeah he traveled heavy not with, two ugly muscle-bound guys, (thank god) but two very cute but very deadly fatale femmes Li and Sammy Ho, played capably by Grayce Wey and Chona Jason. These girls added a bit of spice to the already entertaining film. Both had a nice command of film fighting techniques and are believable as tough girls.
Yeah there is gunfights, fist fights, kicking etc. Not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. As a side comment there is a twelve-minute behind the scenes feature and it is broken up into 25 chapters nice for a low budget film. York entertainment should pat them selves on the back. A commentary would have been nice, but the behind the scenes look was a nice glimpse into the film. This film is worth a purchase, or at least a rental if you are into fight action.",1022112000,2,1591,4.582456140350877
