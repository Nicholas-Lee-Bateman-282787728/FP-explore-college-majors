7275732,3,B00ZBC5C7I,"I purchased ANGST after reading many positive reviews online and in magazines. I finally had my copy arrive from Amazon, and watched it.

Sadly, whilst it's a reasonably competent film, it's also extremely underwhelming!

Firstly, this is nothing like HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. It's got none of that film's ferocity or controversy to help it. The film follow a killer, released from a lengthy sentence, only to still have the desire to go out and kill again. He finds a family, kills them, then... Well, I won't spoil the ending, but like I say, it's all very average, and it's all extremely mediocre.

As a film, it's reasonably entertaining, but other than some surreal camera-work, and a good performance from the lead actor, the film never rises above competent. There's one fairly graphic murder, but that cannot and does not salvage the film. You don't get any real reason for why the killer is the way he is, other than he's a bit mad. Well, so what? And the film offers no reason for us to hate (or be interested in) the killer. He's not very dastardly, nor smart, nor particularly brutal. He's just an average man, undertaking an average killing.

The synth score is okay, but doesn't work for me. It's certainly not as good as Goblin's work for noted Italian Giallo director Dario Argento, and feels a little dated, if I'm honest. Like the film, the music doesn't ever reach any kind of ""wow"" moments. It's just extremely average.

The extras are good, but for this film, it ultimately renders them worthless, when the movie itself is just so average and pedestrian. With over an hour's worth of interviews with cast and crew, it's a shame the film itself doesn't really warrant their inclusion.

Lastly, Cult Epics have restored the film pretty well. However, it has flaws, namely immense vertical juddering in the Prologue and occasional judder in some other scenes. Whether these are a fault in the original negative, I don't know, but even if they are, they could and should have been stabilised.

Ultimately, an average film, with good extras and a good print, but I wouldn't recommend this to horror or thriller fans, purely on the basis it's just not that great. In 1983, this may well have been groundbreaking cinema. By 2015 standards, it's positively pedestrian. A real shame!",1443916800,4,2306,4.793450881612091
7275733,5,B00ZBC5C7I,"Brilliant movie not only for horror film fans. The mise en scene, especially the  cinematograph, is exceptional and complex. This is an edgy, sometimes brutal movie, but also an elegant auteur film that was way ahead of its time.",1443744000,4,229,4.871794871794871

7275736,4,B00ZBC5C7I,"If you are a fan of Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" or John McNaughton's ""Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer"" do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as possible. I had been trying to get a copy since the release of ""Bad Blood"", an excellent source for true horrors that have been translated to the screen. That book is available from Creation Books and is equally recommended. This film takes place virtually in real time and follows the main character's descent in to bloody madness immediately from being released from prison for stabbing his mother. Based upon the real crimes of Werner Kniesek, ""Angst"" follows the events of the day very closely to what is known as the facts of the case. Little to no dialogue but a running narrative from the main character (as in ""I Stand Alone"") will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. Even if you know the facts of this case you'll be constantly wondering what this maniac will do from one minute to the next. The frantic yet excellent photography captures and adds to the  lunacy and left an icy blue imprint on my brain cells. Easily ranks next to ""The Honeymoon Killers"", ""In Cold Blood"", ""The Sadist"" and other top notch true crime classics.",1441670400,8,1184,4.611374407582939

7275738,5,B00ZBC5C7I,This film is  seamless. The only downside I would say is the music is a little out dated they should of made it silent. But wow the acting is  phenomenal. It truly make you feel like your in the characters head. The nervousness he shows feels real. Watching this film makes you feel uncomfortable is a good way.

7275741,4,B00ZBC5C7I,"Setting aside all the praise about the direction and the cinematography, I feel the success of this intense and difficult film all comes down to Edwin Leder's performance. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is often quite good and at times it is perfectly in synch with Leder's acting, which lends the film an organic quality that helped keep me gripped most of the time. I will say that, while the dizzying first person cam effect was new when this was made, it has since been used more often, and it also looks like contemporary go-pro filmmaking. I prefer the crane shot scenes where Leder is seen from above and the marvelous scenes where the camera zooms across a room an instant before Leder does- the best of these being a desperate lunge for a scattered pile of objects in the foreground. the quieter music and calm narration during the murder scenes works incredibly well. and what the director chooses to follow the more brutal scenes with is perfect and considers the viewer, instead of bludgeoning the viewer with non-stop raw ugliness. (the use of an extended shot of the dog serves this purpose incredibly well). I appreciate the Leder's character has a distorted view of just how organized he actually is, because his actions are a mess, and they leave him a mess. There's a very- dare I say it- Hitchcockian approach to murder- it is not easy. Dead weight or resisting weight is NOT easy to drag around, and THAT is another way the film excels. The odd, accidental choreography the camera captures from above the violence can be strangely mesmerizing. There's a nice, strong sense of place with the house as well. There are a few jarring oversights which distracted me- such as two instances where an actor glances right into the camera, and a few awkward, jumpy bits of editing between location shots. Otherwise it's fluid without being showy. And NONE of the violence is in any way made sensual or titillating. It's what it is; TERRIBLE and DISTURBING. The showcase sequence in the tunnel is superbly horrific. And the intensity and placement of this sequence are incredibly well-chosen. I also admire the anti-climactic nature of the real action versus the killer's inner monologue. (the car accident scene is outstanding for this). This film would make an interesting double feature with MAN BITES DOG or HENRY; PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. My one gripe? The cover of the dvd. Incredibly misleading. It's a frame from a sequence where a character's hair seems to suddenly change color for no reason. Leder has such an interesting face I feel it should've been used instead. Or maybe the dachshund? :)",1473724800,2,2624,4.82039911308204

7275743,5,B00ZBC5C7I,"I had yet to discover such a provocative and complex portrayal of a serial killer since Shohei Immamura's 70s brilliant film, Vengence is Mine. Yet when I finally got a chance to view Angst on the screen of a local art house theatre my mind was blown! This Amazingly shocking underground masterpiece explores the German serial killer complex in an unapologetic fashion--leaving no stone unturned in the grisly details of the forensic report. The director chose First POV action rendering the hunter and hunted as surreal objectified animals--bereft of melodrama or sympathy when detailing  the true life murderous rampage. The director creates a masterpiece of discomfort and tensions--jarring close-ups, scene-by-scene depictions of the notorious serial murders and soaring synths by Klaus Schulz (the mastermind behind Tangerine Dream). A must-watch for those who love great films and can have the stomach for this subject matter.",1470700800,8,932,5.472222222222222

7275747,3,B00ZBC5C7I,"I was glad to finally see this notorious film, which combines dazzling camerawork with a kind of bleakly disinterested tone that must have seemed truly radical in the early 80s. Despite the clear ambitions of writer-director Gerald Kargl, however, the crucial home invasion sequence is awkwardly staged and fails to match the disorienting realism that brackets it. I'm tempted to make excuses -- and I suspect I would have convinced myself with available excuses had I seen the Angst when I was younger -- but the flaws are too much to overlook. At the same time, this is a quietly influential film, deserving of critical attention. Three and a half stars.",1459123200,,656,4.918918918918919

7275756,5,B00ZBC5C7I,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I have to confess I had never heard of ANGST prior to getting its press release.  But the plot synopsis grabbed my attention and commanded an interest.  While waiting for the screener copy to arrive, I did some research on the film.  Curiously, ANGST is the only movie director Gerald Kargl has listed on his IMDB pagebut hes worked on over 120 commercials, promotional films, and documentaries since its 1983 release.  Regardless, I am happy to report ANGST is a heck of a film, and horror fans will want to snatch it up immediately.

I think the biggest draw of this film is the realism.  Actor Erwin Leder does an amazing job as the killer, and his performance is downright bone-chilling.  What he does to his victims, and the calm way he describes his mindset via the narration, both lend a major dose of credibility to this epic movie.

ANGST is filmed very well, and the cinematic style is a major part of what makes this film so terrifying.  Many of the shots involve the camera rotating around Leder as he goes about his business, but this does not appear to be achieved in the traditional way; the camera seems to be mounted on a rig that is attached to Leder himself.  This unique perspective amplifies the tension in the film, and makes for a more thrilling experience.

As mentioned, the acting is top notch, with Leder in the main role.  Interestingly, none of his supporting cast last long enough to become developed.  More time is spent on Leder himself, which helps cast a darker shadow on the tone of the film.

ANGST is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The in-depth glimpse the film gives into the mind of a serial killer is staggeringly realistic, and you will remember this film for a long time after the credits roll.",1444003200,9,1826,4.521341463414634
8719763,3,B00ZBC5C7I,"Interestingly filmed but overall lacking in decent characters. With the murderer I felt like I was watching a 14 yr old boy spastically carry the whole thing out. I didn't feel much for the family. The most haunting part was the final murder but overall it felt silly at parts and hollow in others. I usually like a slow burn, meticulous thriller but this just didn't really deliver.",1533772800,,383,4.647058823529412
8719764,5,B00ZBC5C7I,This is a disturbing classic. I saw this on Gaspar Noes favorite film list. I watched it and really agreed with his opinion on how awesome the cinematography was. Really good stuff.,1531440000,,181,4.6875
8719765,1,B00ZBC5C7I,"ANGST is what I felt watching this! I have NEVER seen such a ridiculous movie in my life. The killer was a bumbling idiot who could not even walk without tripping all over himself. Watching this ""menacing killer"" fumbling, bumbling, and literally stumbling around was like watching an old Mr. Bean or Jerry Lewis as ""the idiot""! lol. I am NOT exaggerating. I became so annoyed watching this spastic fool (worst acting ever!!) I had to fast forward because I couldn't stand the long drawn out scenes of him hunching over while walking and tripping over his own feet. I was seriously in disbelief that this was supposed to be serious. The guy was so inept it really was funny to watch this actor try to seem ""disturbed""....I was embarrassed for him. I have never had a reaction like this to a movie...I can usually find SOMETHING good in it, but not here. It was THAT bad. I am really angry I paid to watch what I thought would be a scary creepy movie, and got a low budget COMEDY instead.

8719767,4,B00ZBC5C7I,"The reaction to any film is subjective; every one of them is in the eye of the beholder. That proviso  which should be unnecessary  must be kept very much in mind for my comments on this German film that purports to be based on true events. Whether that  or the undeniable artistry involved  will excuse what is a deeply unpleasant viewing experience depends very much on the viewer. On the basis of a single viewing (and no desire to repeat that) I am undecided if this is a stylish examination of a psychotic individual or an excuse for style with no true substance. A deranged man, identified only as K (Erwin Leder)  a nod to Kafka?  is released from prison after serving a 10 year term. He had previously been incarcerated for four years for stabbing his mother (she survived) and is now finished with a second stay for stabbing an elderly woman (she didnt). He has spent more than half his life behind bars. We learn of his history  and that he is already scouting for his next victims immediately on release  from voice-over narration (Robert Hunger-Buhler).
 He locates an isolated mansion and breaks in, assuming the place is empty. There is, however, a wheelchair-bound man inside and his mother and sister soon return from shopping. K begins his killing and necrophilic spree by drowning the man in a bathtub. The film is violent (emphasized by dazzling camerawork from Zbigniew Rybczynski) and unrelenting  subduing, binding and killing his victims is portrayed as awkward and laborious. That things get quite bloody (but not gross-out gory) will tip you off if this is a film for you. I give kudos to Leder for a terrific performance and what must have been an exhausting one as he trots all over the large house and estate, often lugging victims and later their corpses. Gerald Kargis film has visual panache to burn, with camera moves I wouldnt have thought possible at the time. Yes, the movie is based on a famous Austrian serial killer and the voice-over quotes several notorious murderers, such as Peter Kurten. But is the film truly an exploration of a disturbed mind (as its director contends) or an excuse for gratuitous violence? Im just not prepared to say. It is decidedly very strong stuff.
