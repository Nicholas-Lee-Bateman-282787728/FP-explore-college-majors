2663976,1,B000IU3XRY,"In her day, Phyllis Diller was entertaining, hilarious, and a trailblazer for women in comedy. Unfortunately, humor, like clothing, changes with the times. Diller's fast-paced, vaudevillian gags worked well back in the sixties, and even the seventies. But the wisecracking, quick-response stand-up is no longer funny.  These performances have great value in the history of humor: but they are just not funny anymore.",1254873600,,416,5.603174603174603
2663977,4,B000IU3XRY,Great laughs here and there. Not quite as funny as I'd thought it would be.,1241654400,,75,4.066666666666666
2663978,2,B000IU3XRY,I was very disappointed in this DVD.  It definitely was not what I expected.,1231718400,,76,4.428571428571429
2663979,5,B000IU3XRY,"Since Phyllis was rather popular when i was younger (late 60's), I cannot imagine any female comic not saying 'thank you' to Phyllis for opening doors. Here is a delightful dvd that includes a few of her tv  specials. I don't remember these when they were first shown on tv, I guess I was in bed early or something.
Her outrageous outfits, perfect timing, clean jokes, and special guests makes this dvd a good evening for those who would like to experience her wit, and happy go lucky attitude.",1212192000,6,494,4.550561797752809

2663982,4,B000IU3XRY,"It took me a while but I finally found out this was from a variety show called THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE that ran from '64 to '70 and it was guest hosted weekly on Saturday nights by people like Sammy Davis Jr., Don Adams, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and other child beaters.  This DVD runs about an hour and is just clips of Diller's monologues along with some skits with Don Rickles and others.  The best ones were with her, Rickles and Terry-Thomas (from 1969) who kept flubbing his lines and laughing hysterically.  The canned laughter is is an assault on the ears but that's what you got with TV comedy for decades and there's no avoiding that.

Whoever put this brief compilation together didn't pay close enough attention.  Diller's monologues repeat jokes.  It's bad enough that it happened at all but at least you had a few weeks, months or years between hearing them as they originally aired.  You've got to be Leonard from MEMENTO (2000) to not notice it while watching this DVD.  I really dig Diller but she laughs a lot during her monologues and you get more than you can handle when they're strung together for long stretches at a time and it's interrupted by that annoying canned laughter.  You could say she's the female Bob Hope with a mix of Rodney Dangerfield.  She's very much a self-deprecating comic.  Her best joke on this release is when she's talking about being old, ""My G-string is clear on down to D flat.""  Now THAT'S funny!  The MPI DVD has a couple of extras, a soap commercial with Diller and a 7-minute segment from a 1963 episode of WHAT'S MY LINE? that has as panelists Shelley Berman, Arlene Francis, Dorothy Kilgallen, Bennett Cerf, host John Daly and announcer Johnny Olson.  That was fun.",1405123200,,1735,4.627450980392157
2663983,4,B000IU3XRY,"This collection gives a good overview of the type of humor that Ms. Diller was noted for.  She was a performer that delivered a joke every 30 seconds in vaudeville style.  The CD has material that is substantially dated; however, it is a good example of the style of jokes and delivery that made Ms. Diller a pioneer and leader in her profession.",1404086400,2,346,4.476190476190476
2663984,2,B000IU3XRY,"Not really what we expected, but, we'll keep it for our collection????
We thought it was one of her funny movies.",1404086400,,113,4.428571428571429
2663985,5,B000IU3XRY,"We came across her on a documentary we were watching, and saw a few clips that were really funny. We looked her up and came across this dvd on Amazon. She had different material, and was so funny. She apparently was the first house wife to do stand up. She was awesome!",1400716800,,269,4.1923076923076925
2663986,3,B000IU3XRY,"Phyllis Diller was a great comedienne whose act revolved around her looks. She was a guest on several TV programs in the 1960s and 1970s and even had her own show for a while (as mentioned in one of the skits). She could be extremely funny.

While this DVD IS funny I don't think the material used really do her justice as an entertainer. Not even Don Rickles could pull the fat out of the fire on this one. I would have rather seen either a larger collection of her material or at least a collection which was more carefully selected.",1382918400,,535,4.297029702970297
2663987,5,B000IU3XRY,"She's the funniest woman ever!  Her material, her delivery, I've never laughed so hard! Glad for the dvds cause she will be sorely missed.",1358121600,,138,4.75
2663988,4,B000IU3XRY,"It's Phyllis.  Good ol' self-effacing Phyllis (my favorite sort of humor).

Trouble is it repeats a lot, showing her doing the same jokes in different settings and at different appearances.  If you can get past the repetition, you should be able to enjoy this blast from the past.

It's vintage Phyllis  :-))",1351987200,2,308,4.846153846153846
2663989,4,B000IU3XRY,"This is a really fun DVD for Phyllis Diller fans, with many of her best comedy clips from ""The Hollywood Palace"" and ""The Beautiful Phyllis Diller"" TV shows heavily featured.  From Fang's mother, make-up and housekeeping tips, ""The Phyllis Diller Charm & Finishing School"", and a slew of celebrity guest-stars, this DVD takes you on an hilarious trip back in time to Phyllis Diller's heydey as the reigning comedy queen of television.

Highlights:  Don Rickles, Terry-Thomas and Diller in the ""hijacked aeroplane"" skit; Diller in beach gear singing ""Music to Watch Girls By"" with Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello and Phil Harris; and the King Sisters joining Diller in fright wigs and blue chiffon for graduation day at ""Phyllis Diller's Charm & Finishing School"".

The signature stand-up comedy monologues with Diller have lost some of their bite with the passing years; yet Diller's keen sense of oddball humour and self-deprecating wit, in itself, remains as timeless as ever.  A great addition to your collection of classic TV shows.",1273795200,2,1038,5.191616766467066

8147568,5,B000IU3XRY,"I have watched this twice and love it. Phyllis Diller was such a brilliant and funny woman and this DVD captures an era of our history that I miss as well as great clean humor that is tough to find anymore. My favorite housekeeping hint, ""If your children write their name in the dust, tell them not to include the year."" (I may not have worded it exactly as she said it but so funny. Lots of her stand up acts in the DVD, a few lines are repeated but overall so worth it. My 25 year old son enjoyed this also!",1419206400,2,510,4.009803921568627
