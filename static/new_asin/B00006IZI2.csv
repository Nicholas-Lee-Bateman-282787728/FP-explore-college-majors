7969846,5,B00006IZI2,This is an excellent way to learn what goes on at Marine boot camp. Our son was in San Diego at MCRD when we watched it and it gave us an idea of what he was doing. I would recommend everyone watch it even if you don't have a recruit at boot camp.,1522022400,,247,3.6792452830188678

7969848,5,B00006IZI2,"This move is getting to be a few years old and it shows in the picture, which is a little grainier than today.  But the substance and authenticity is still there.  Even my kids were interested and watched the entire thing with us, asking questions the entire time.  Very real and humbling.",1476662400,,289,4.519230769230769

7969851,3,B00006IZI2,"This documentary is an OK ""sanitized for the public"" type DVD about Marine Corps boot camp.
 Watching this video I can see that todays Marine Corps recruits train every bit as hard as we did in the 70's but one thing is missing....the very *creative* use of curse words that D.I's are capable of. Think along the lines of R.Lee Ermey's portrayal of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman in the movie Full Metal Jacket THAT is the way I remember Drill Instructors as being!",1196467200,,455,4.548780487804878
7969852,5,B00006IZI2,"I love this Documentary, it was actually filmed at MCRD San Diego A few months before I went to boot camp there, So I can Completely relate to this filming, it actually brings tears to my eyes every time.  I recomend this film to everyone, especially former, Current and planning to be Marines.  Semper Fi.",1167955200,3,306,4.545454545454546
7969853,5,B00006IZI2,"I love this video.  Probably because my husband is in it!  Now I can see exactly what he went through and why he changed so much before and after boot camp.  It really puts all Marines I meet in a different light, since I will never join the Marines I can still experience what they went through to become who they are today.  It will really help you make up your mind if you're ready to be one of ""The Few and The Proud""",1055721600,4,421,3.9761904761904763

USMC is awesome !!!",1027382400,7,136,3.4193548387096775
