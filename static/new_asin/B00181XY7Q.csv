3176793,3,B00181XY7Q,"So...basically, this is the comedy alternate universe version of ""Ashes of Time"", made with most of the same people (and at the same time!), but with the roles swapped around to different actors (and they're all pretty big name stars, obviously having fun hamming it up!). Once again, we have an unofficial prequel to the wuxia classic ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"", a sort of ""what were the Five Greats like when they were young?"" Very silly, apparently! They make fun of tons of wuxia genre conventions (people feeding each other poisons... in this case giant centipedes! to control each other, the cross-dressing, the ridiculous ""hidden (thrown) weapons"" ... in this case a flying boot!, lovey-dovey couple's swordplay, monsters in caves, secret martial arts manuals, super-powered fighting moves...which Brigitte Lin's character hadn't quite mastered yet, romantic musical numbers, etc.) It's very hit and miss. Many of the scenes drag on for too long. Some I didn't find funny at all.

Worth seeing if you like this kind of silly Hong Kong comedy. However, yes, the subtitles are terrible. The songs don't have English subtitles at all. And note that the movie was made for the Chinese New Year, which is why it has all that ""Happy New Year!"" stuff at the end. Not to be confused with the ten zillion ""serious"" versions of the ""Condor/Eagle Heroes"" out there.",1274054400,2,1364,4.982456140350878
3176794,5,B00181XY7Q,"Right on the heels of the oh-so-serious Ashes of Time, virtually the entire cast appeared in this wacky Chinese New Year's comedy.  Basically, it is a spoof of the same swordplay source material that inspired Ashes of Time, but with unbridled laughter, not deep philosophical contemplation, as the aim.  Some of Hong Kong's best A-List actors from the early 90s are on hand and everything in this movie is aimed at extracting maximum laughs.  Typical of these types of comedies, there is silliness galore--cross-dressing, thwarted romance, comic fight scenes, preposterous plot twists and just the right amount of overacting and scenery chewing to keep the laughs coming (and plenty of inside jokes and plays on words that would have Hong Kong audiences rolling in the aisles).  Oh, and did I mention over-the-top musical numbers?  The sets are clearly cardboard and threaten to collapse at the slightest touch.  The special effects are hardly special, the costumes are all slightly tacky and the plot, such as it is, is convoluted and slightly chaotic.  But there is fun to be had in every scene--if Hong Kong wacky New Year's comedies are your cup of tea.  If you are a fan of pre-Shaolin Soccer Stephen Chow, this movie will be a delight.  But be forewarned, if you aren't a fan of that type of HK comedy, you may just be scratching your head and wondering why I thought this was such a great movie.  For non-Chinese audiences, HK comedies either tickle your funny bone, or they don't.  If they do, this one is an absolute gem.",1266278400,8,1530,4.801526717557252

A hilarious parody on the main characters from the classic Chinese story  and Hong Kong TV series ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"". Its very humorous, comical, witty entertaining hour of laugh. Its WITTY written (double meaning in the actor's lines)
Spoof on the characters of the younger heroes and villians done by the BEST of Hong Kong A-lister movie/singers of the 90's and perhaps all times. There will never able to have a wonderful cast like this again.
Joey Wang (Ghost Story), Maggie Cheung (Mission Impossible III), and Carina Lau (Detective Dee), and Kenny Bee all have retired and LESLIE (Ashes Of Time Redux) who considered to be a great Actor and Singer all times died tragically young.
Tony Chiu Wai Leung (RED CLIFF), Tony Leung (The Lover) and Jacky Cheung (singer/actor) are still acting.

8268283,3,B00181XY7Q,Could use more action and less humor. I was surprised how few fight scenes there are in this and most of them are more special effects and wire work than actual martial arts. Downright silly in some places especially towards the end.,1454976000,,233,4.571428571428571
8268284,5,B00181XY7Q,"If you're looking for a cohesive plot, then this is the wrong movie for you.  The film maker is set out to create a hilarious mindless fun movie and succeeds in this over the top, kung fu movie spoof",1454544000,,199,4.102564102564102
8268285,5,B00181XY7Q,"So it's already been said that this is the funny version of Wong Kar Wai's Ashes of time, that being said, both movies were based on the famous novel written by Jin Yong -- The legend of the condor heroes.
In the novel, there are total five most famous kung fu champions in different part of China.
They are
A doctor of traditional Chinese medicine from the East  - Huang Yao shi;
A master of poison  ( also a bad people )  from the West - Ou Yang Feng;
A king from the South - Duan Yu;
A king of beggars ( the leader of all beggars ) from the North - Hong qi
And a a priest in Taoism from the central - Wong Chong yang.
They will meet on top of Hua Mountain every year to fight and find out who is the best among them- Who will be the king of Kung Fu.
Ledeng has it the top Kung Fu was written in a missing book called 9 Yin Ching,
So they are trying to find the book to excise and become the Kung Fu King.
Knowing these, I hope you will have a more clearer picture watching this movie.
***********something I want to say because the novel is one of my all time favorite but maybe it has nothing about this film***********
The story happened during the period of Jin-Song war,the storyline is not about fight to become the king of Kung Fu, but more about a boy(not mentioned in this movie) who is not so brilliant but has a kind heart became the king of Kung Fu and wins all of the above champions which are all elder and skillful than him and uses his Kung Fu to help army to resist invasion, protect his country.
Moron of the novel is, in my opinion: Kindness and forgiveness wins over all skills and talents. The king of Kung Fu ( true hero ) is not about fighting or wining - that way you only became a fighter or a killer,no,it's all about peace keeping, protect others and stop people from hurting others or stop the war.
The song - <who is the true hero> was written by Huang Zhan, I think he has the same understanding, the lyric also mentioned that "" A true hero is brave and stop people from fighting, he doesn't care about fame and title.""",1454284800,2,2051,4.084367245657568

Produced during WangJiawei's another condor hero movie.
Very funny.
Most chinese people under 50s have saw it more than one time.",1452816000,,204,4.694444444444445
8268287,2,B00181XY7Q,I wish they would find all the Kung Fu movies in ENGLISH! A LOT OF THEM LISTED I HAVE SEEN IN ENGLISH!!!#,1448150400,,105,3.8181818181818183
8268288,5,B00181XY7Q,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is so over the top that it redefines over the top. It makes fun of practically every Chinese movie genre. The colorful costumes, the ridiculous names for Martial Arts styles and moves, the dancing and singing. The English language dialog is hilarious and I wonder how much funnier the Cantonese is. This movie is like a combination of the Three Stooges and the Keystone Kops doing Shakespeare's A Midsummers Night's Dream. If you are a fan of Chinese Cinema and enjoy a good comedy this is one to watch. This movie should win an award for Best Use of the William Tell Overture (with lyrics)",1446681600,3,646,4.52991452991453
