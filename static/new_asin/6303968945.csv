741846,5,6303968945,"I have been waiting for the release of this movie on DVD for years and finally my dream came true. It is a very enjoyable movie talking about love, money and greed. Andy Garcia is a wonderful actor and it is a double pleasure to see him acting as twin brothers. Own this DVD and you won't be disappointed.",1088208000,2,305,4.186440677966102
741847,5,6303968945,"From the man who brought us ""The Fugitive"" and ""Under Siege"" (the good one), comes an original comedic tale of two brothers fighting over the same inheritance.

Starring Andy Garcia... and Andy Garcia, ""Steal Big, Steal Little"" succeeds in every way that ""Multiplicity"", ""Dead Ringers"" and a few of the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movies have failed.  The twin brothers, both played BRILLIANTLY by Garcia, couldn't be more dissimilar (one is good and one is bad).  So when their adoptive mother leaves her fortune and estate to only one of the brothers -- the fun begins!

Clever camera tricks and a fast-paced script make ""Steal Big, Steal Little"" the perfect movie for anyone who has ever been caught in the middle of a battle for family inheritance.

Andy Garcia's finest work.",1051833600,4,779,4.916030534351145
741848,4,6303968945,"One of Andrew ""The Fugitive"" Davis' few non-suspense movies, this comedy recieved terrible reviews and zero box office upon its theatrical release--but it would be well worth seeing for many.  Full of terrific character actors and sporting a jumbled chronology, the film tells the story of identical twin brothers (Andy Garcia, once again a naturally joyful presence) at war with each other over their adoptive mother's bountiful estate.  The more selfish of the two siblings may have a lot of politicans in his pocket, but his generous opponent has a few tricks up his sleeve as well.  Though essentially a ""dramedy"" in tone, there are occasional detours into slapstick that treaten to tip the balance.  On the whole, however, this is the kind of fresh and highly moral piece of entertainment that comes out of Hollywood pretty rarely.  It's so much more popular, it seems, to be smug and ironic.  ""Steal Big, Steal Little"" doesn't go that route and leaves me feeling positive and optomistic.",973555200,2,993,4.987878787878788
741915,5,6303968945,"I've loved this film for years and finally own the DVD. I'm an Andy Garcia fan any way and this is a great "" good triumphs"" movie.",1356998400,,130,3.8518518518518516
741916,1,6303968945,This movie was my first exposure to Andy Garcia and the only good thing about that was I learned I didn't want to see any more. I agreed with the Amazon reviewer completely and am stunned at the icky declarations of love for Andy and this movie that stole two hours of my life. To each his own!,1324252800,,294,4.086206896551724
741917,5,6303968945,"This is a great movie. Amazon's review is misleading; they should remove that poor review. This movie celebrates live; it is about human love for those less fortunate fellows who still believe in the American dream like our ancestors. This is one of the best gifts from Andy Garcia, a great Latino actor, for humanity which sadly is not appreciated in these days. I wish there was a new release of this fabulous movie at a more reasonable price.",1291766400,,445,4.6455696202531644
741918,5,6303968945,"I saw this movie in the late 90's, actually many times after seeing it on HBO.  Bought it on VHS.  Watched it over and over.  The cast ensemble is beautifully put together.  The storyline as other reviewer have pointed out has wonderful twists and turns.  It is nice to watch a movie that doesn't have blood and guts and goar every 15 seconds.  Or some little teenager prancing about nude.  I love Andy Garcia.  He is quite versitle and doesn't do alot of movies.  In an interview once, he was asked why he never did love scenes and said because he didn't want to disrespect his wife.  Wonderful actor and fine man.",1245801600,3,615,4.410714285714286
741919,5,6303968945,"This film is one of the greats. Andy Garcia is just terrific. It has all the sensibilitys that more films need.. The cast is superb and Alan Arkin especially shines as is right on in his role of Lou.
God Bless you Andy!

741920,4,6303968945,"Andy Garcia put on a great performance, I am not a big fan but he captured my attention in this film with a interesting story. It was a very intriging film believe it or not but then again Ally Walker was in it and I am a huge fan!!",1126483200,,232,3.7551020408163267
741921,5,6303968945,All though the back of the package shows this film to be in the 4.3 fitted tv format  you will be surprised to find that it is letterboxed and widescreen in the full theater format preserving its theatrical screen format version. Widescreen lovers enjoy.,1120176000,,254,4.7727272727272725
741922,4,6303968945,"As I was browsing through the HBO offerings last Friday night I saw the unusual pairing of Alan Arkin and Andy Garcia. I missed the crucial first fifteen minutes, and was a bit confused, but that's not really a bad thing in this movie. After the plot sort of began to make sense to me, Joey Pants showed up as Ruben's (the good, kind, warm hearted brother) attorney. That clinched it. Even though a new storyline or plot twist was thrown in every few minutes like adding more chils for salsa, with Andy Garcia, (who is much, much more than a man with a love for hats)* Alan Arkin, Andy Garcia, Joe Pantoliano and David Ogden Stiers, I was laughing (or crying) every moment.

There are definite hold your breath moments about what's going to happen next; and the scenery is pretty darn good, too.

It reminded me at first of a James Cagney movie, 'Never Steal Anything Small', which has a similar title, but other than the leads being lovable and charming, the movies are not really the same.

This is also a long movie, the running time is 2 hours and 15 minutes, but it never dragged, and was never boring. It was kind of like if Billy Jack and Caine from Kung Fu were really identical twins and Billy Jack decided he wanted more money and power and to sell all their land.

As another reviewer said, it is acted lovingly by everyone in the cast, which makes it even more endearing.

It gets a four star from Casablanca, and only misses five because of some of the things at the big party.

Watch it, watch it twice...make some guacamole, buy something good to drink, and just enjoy it.",1119139200,9,1587,4.417808219178082
741923,4,6303968945,"This is not your typical evil twin movie, although on the surface it might seem so. Twin brothers are raised by a rich woman who adopts them. When she dies, the evil twin wants to make money off the land, while the good twin wants to share the land and all the wealth with everybody. It's not the funniest movie but I did enjoy the lightheartedness of it. The few scenes where the twins are shown together are some of the most convincing digitized twin scenes I've ever seen.

Flaws: It was a little unfocused and longer than it needed to be, but I liked the loving spirit that most of the people in this movie had. And who doesn't love a movie with a happy ending?

From what I've read about Andy Garcia, the good twin is very similar in his generous, caring nature but Andy is probably better in his money management skills. This is not Andy's best work (although his acting was superb) but nonetheless a ""must have"" in your Andy Garcia collection. Alan Arkin was lovable as the Andy's friend who tries to steer him in the right direction. Rachel Ticotin also does a respectable job as the wife who at first is reluctant to get back together with her husband.",1114214400,6,1161,4.395348837209302
741924,5,6303968945,"Wow, the Amazon review is both mean-spirited and dead wrong (as anyone who has seen his brilliant performance in 'When A Man Loves a Woman' knows). I am not what you would call an Andy Garcia ""fan"" but give the man his due -- this is a very good movie, funny ensemble cast (especially Alan Arkin and Joe Pantoliano), and lovely location. So lighten up.",1098489600,15,352,4.430769230769231
