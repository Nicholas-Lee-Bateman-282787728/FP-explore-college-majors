7540751,5,B0185X21XM,Love it.,1464825600,,8,3.5
7540752,5,B0185X21XM,The shipping was unbelievably fast (arrived almost a full week before scheduled!). The DVD quality so far (just watched the first episode) is fantastic and the memories from watching them again are very worthwhile! Hope this helps those on the edge...but most of us interested in this show already know what it's worth!,1464825600,,319,5.037735849056604
7540753,5,B0185X21XM,"My set arrived yesterday in the mail and it is awesome!  This show is entertaining and so much fun.  Very good image quality for DVD.  Audio is good, too.  So glad I ordered this when I did as it appears to be ""currently unavailable"" again  a hard to find item, both at Amazon and in Walmart stores (it is supposedly a Walmart exclusive only at this time).  Already watched the first of three discs and the episodes are really good.  In fact, I like these episodes better than some of the first season episodes (probably partly because I remember watching these second season episodes as a kid more than the earlier season).  The packaging is nice, although companies do seem to be using cheaper and cheaper DVD cases all the time for releases.  The material is so thin and feels like it will break even if you hold it too tight.  That quibble aside this is a nice set and Shout Factory has done a great job of bringing us the final season of Baa Baa Black Sheep.  Here's hoping they'll either re-release the first season (previously released by Universal) or give us a complete series package.  Highly recommended!",1464134400,,1115,4.547738693467337
7540754,5,B0185X21XM,"Finally, the rest of the series.",1463529600,,32,4.5
7540755,5,B0185X21XM,"I've been waiting for many years for the last episodes and they arrived today in the mail! I've only watched one episode, but if you're a true Baa Baa Black Sheep fan go place an order for these as soon as they're listed as in stock. I had to keep checking on it daily to get mine. The transfer is fantastic and I'm picky about the quality of what I watch!

In the late 1970s we used to drive through Paris, Texas on the way to my aunt's house and always stopped to eat at the little restaurant on the highway near the airport where Junior Burchinal kept many of his airplanes, including one of the Corsairs used in the making of this TV series. I still recall taking a polaroid of it sitting in a hangar. At age 13 the Corsair was a huge airplane and now, at age 50, it's still big!

Be sure to catch Robert Conrad's radio show on Thursday afternoons on CRN's Talk Radio from 3:00pm PST. I discovered it last summer and it's really fun to hear him talk about Black Sheep Squadron, Wild Wild West, and Hawaiian Eye along with other current events in his life.",1463356800,10,1059,4.211822660098522
7540756,5,B0185X21XM,I agree with the other posts in that the colors seem better than the previous seasons and the picture quality is even better. These discs are better packaged and better labeled than those older seasons. The final 13 shows have been greatly missed and is well worth the money for fans of this old show.,1462579200,6,301,4.490909090909091
7540757,5,B0185X21XM,"After all these years, the final season has arrived (13 episodes on 3 DVDs). I cant be sure but it seems like its been enhanced. The picture looks great  on my older Panasonic 55 in flat screen TV. The video itself (at least the one I've watched so far) is plenty bright and the colors pop. Although none of this would really matter anyway for those of us who waited all these years, the fact that this is a quality product is a very welcome and pleasant surprise! If you are a fan, buy it!!",1462492800,11,491,4.168421052631579
7540758,5,B0185X21XM,"These missing episodes were long overdue. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of this set. Picture was bright and clear, sound was crystal clear. All missing 13 episodes are here and now the entire series is finally available. I was expecting bootleg quality but instead, this set was professionally produced. To be honest, this final release is much better quality all around than the previous two. This is the missing piece we were waiting for all these years and I highly recommend all Black Sheep Squadron fans to jump in and purchase this set, you won't be disappointed.",1462320000,12,586,4.87

7540829,5,B0185X21XM,"Baa Baa Black Sheep was a good show that had an unfortunate problem with timeslots.  Produced by Stephen J. Cannell, the producer of Rockford Files and many good series and starring the great Robert Conrad in his best role since James T. West on The Wild Wild West, the show premiered in the Bicentennial year of 1976.  Unfortunately, it was scheduled Tuesday nights against Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley, the number one and two highest rated shows on tv.  The show was cancelled after one year.
But Robert Conrad wouldn't let it die and started lobbying NBC's affiliates for another chance.  He was successful and NBC picked up the series as a mid-season replacement with a change in title to Black Sheep Squadron.  But NBC continued to show its stupidity by putting it against Charlies Angels, the then-third highest rated shows on TV.  It was cancelled again after 13 episodes (along with most of NBC's schedule.)
Since they knew they were going against Charlies Angels, they added four cute nurses to the cast (including Conrad's daughter Nancy,) that were nick-named ""Pappy's Lambs.""  It really didn't help.
I watched the series and enjoyed it.  My only problem was the fact that they really couldn't show very realistic wartime violence since the show was originally scheduled in the ""family hour.""  I remember one episode where the Japanese are attacking Pappy's island on the ground and are being strafed by Pappy's corsair machine guns, you never see anyone get hit or fall down, the violence was on a level with McHales Navy.  But this was just a small problem, the series was still well-one and enjoyable.

7540862,5,B0185X21XM,"I have been waiting to purchase the last episodes of Baa Baa Black Sheep since 2007 and I thought I would be waiting for ever!! I am very happy to finally be able to purchase this DVD and I have started to watch the entire TV Show from the beginning. I have briefly checked these DVD's and the quality is very good, better then Vol1 & 2 of Baa Baa Black Sheep, but the art work for this DVD title is different to what is on the Amazon website.

The story line and antics of the Black Sheep may be hard to believe sometimes, but it's excellent entertainment and flying scenes are fantastic!! I was also happy to receive this DVD Title here in Australia within 8 days of ordering it.",1466553600,9,681,4.198473282442748

7540864,5,B0185X21XM,"Finally, the last 13 episodes of Baa Baa Black Sheep. This was a really fantastic show from the 70's. And it had the two things that make a tv show great, airplanes, and WWII airplanes. The video transfer looks as good as you are going to get from dvd quality which in this case is very good. Robert Conrad was perfectly cast as the dashing, unconventional Greg ""Pappy"" Boyington of WWII fame. It was pretty much ""Hollywooded up"" so it made the war look like a minor inconvenience for the men of the Black Sheep squadron. But the stories are great and the flying sequences are fantastic. They even intersperse some actual footage from the war. Climb on board and see the last 13 episodes of a really great show that died much, much too soon. You won't regret it.",1466208000,,762,4.45
7540865,5,B0185X21XM,"FINELY!!! I now have the whole Black Sheep on DVD!!! Great show and these DVDs are very high quality. I watched some of them last evening and really enjoyed the show. They were delivered quickly and no damage to package or DVD container or DVDs
Great service and thanks.",1465948800,2,270,4.530612244897959
7540866,5,B0185X21XM,"""Five Aces"" to ""Shout Factory"" for releasing this final season of this great series!!!  Squadrons of Black Sheep fans have waited years to watch these last 13 episodes!!!  Shame on you Universal Studios for not releasing this final season years ago!!!""  Apathy and neglect of VMF 214 fans are grounds for a court martial!!!  If you enjoyed Baa Baa Black Sheep volumes 1 & 2 you will enjoy  Black Sheep Squadron, the final season.  It is equal in quality and entertainment except I missed Gutterman. This final season was harder to find and obtain then it should have been.  If you are a fan order it quickly because I suspect that it will be a small limited release. Thank You again Shout Factory I salute you and you deserve a squadron of ""victory rolls""  from all us fans.  Semper Fi!!!",1465776000,30,788,4.571428571428571

8741530,5,B0185X21XM,"I am not a big fan of war movies. This show is most excellent. A lot can be said about the production of the show, but overall the entertainment value is awesome. Watching the same plane go down in a dozen or more episodes was not entertaining. Robert Conrad and the other members of a star-filled cast were great. Seeing Pappy Boyington in a couple of cameo appearances added to the realism. He was there although liberties were taken in making the show. It would have been great to be a part of that generation. Men were men, women were women and people fought, lived, died and drank with great excess. It looked like fun. I think they would feel as I do as a veteran and would be greatly disappointed in how this country is doing these days.",1530316800,,744,4.359712230215828
