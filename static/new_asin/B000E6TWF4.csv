8106799,1,B000E6TWF4,Another pathetic movie I wasted time watching (half of it anyway).  It will either end up in my garbage or at a trade-in store.  Don't waste your time or money on it.,1448323200,,166,4.15625
8106800,1,B000E6TWF4,This movie should not have been made. Whoever thought these actors were talented needs to be examined. The movie sucked,1394409600,,119,5.0
8106801,1,B000E6TWF4,"Okay first off all, I am a fan of cheezy movies or ID movies.  However this is the worst film I ever watched. There isn't anything in the movie to say anything positive about. The editing is the worst, the lighting is always wrong, the acting is so bad, the plot has so many WTF moments. If I had to say something positive about the movie, the audio was okay. Nothing popped or was blown out.

I'm almost tempted to email the editing company and ask them what the hell man!?! I am guessing that they didn't have enough good shots or B roll, so they had to cut the main camera in the middle of the conversations, leading to jumps that makes no sense.

Usually the blood is good in low budget movies,  there was almost none when people got killed. The script supervisor didn't do their job. The gas station guy was ""missing"" a tooth in the beginning.  Then he has perfect teeth later on.

There were many shots that you would question why did I just need to watch that.

Over all, I wouldn't watch this if I was paid.

Please tell me this is their first movie. If not, they need to find a new profession.",1319932800,,1102,4.214285714285714
8106802,4,B000E6TWF4,"Yes, this is another ghost story/slasher flick with some nosy kids, but it does have it's own unique elements and a surprise or two with a storyline.  We have some decent young actors and not bad cinematography.",1204675200,,211,4.702702702702703
8106803,1,B000E6TWF4,"Ok, some guys and gals go camping in a desserted town called blood creek and disturb a legendary spirit.  Blah blah blah...Well, where the hell is the action?  There is barely none.  No blood, no gore, poor editing, poor make-up and sound effects.  This one is a snoozer, if you're looking for a similar kind of movie/plot, go with Dead Mary, I think you'll be more pleased.",1201478400,3,374,4.537313432835821
8106804,4,B000E6TWF4,"Blood Creek turned out the way I thought it would, almost.  The woman they call the dark lady, could've been a little creepier.  All she did was wear some white face paint with black spread under her eyes.  Also the film, every 5 to 10 seconds would stop and start 1 second ahead, like I was watching the movie through a strobe light.  I got used to it after about a half hour.  But all in all the movie was very good for what they had to work with.  The ending, all though a little confusing at first gave me chills.  Lots of cool partying scenes and camping scenes.  The farmer with the pitch fork is pretty creepy as well.  So if you like a good slasher / ghost movie pick this up for Halloween.  Maybe pick up a six pack to.",1191974400,8,728,4.063380281690141
