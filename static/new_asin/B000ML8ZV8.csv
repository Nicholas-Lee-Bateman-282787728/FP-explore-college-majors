Plot (If there really was one all): A young woman has family problems with her mother and brother, who is a macho high testosterone loose cannon type set about to deal with his internal frustrations.  Her friend tries to cheer her up as they embark together in High School life.  A small town where this dysfunctional family lives has a dark sinister secret, where an evil hidden Satanic witch cult of doom has set about a scheme to execute a series of very violent crimes against targets of opportunity (including the girl's boyfriend, a town official, and a naked attractive teenage 80's hair cut era girl).  Victims are impaled with pitchforks, and hacked to death with machetes in order to fulfill the desires of the cult master, who believes that Lucifer has sent him on a mission of rampage.  Other sexy young women are stripped nude and offered for human sacrifice, to further satisfy Lucifer's desires for fresh victims with virgin bloodshed, as per directed by the head warlock (who might also be a vampire since he enjoys drinking blood).

A ""Halloween- Friday the 13th Jason"" like killer hides in the shadows and waits in people's houses after breaking in, to hunt down and viciously murder people who are unfortunate enough to come home to the same house he's in.  Halloween comes to town, and thus a final act of initiation and proof of loyalty must be carried out by the young out of control 20 something stud to carry out his unholy witch destiny.

 This is a slightly different, bizarre, interwoven plot that any 9 year old can figure out fairly quickly, but different enough to stand out way above 90% pf the other trash films in this past 80's variety.  Acting is really bad, so don't look for Academy Award material here by any means.

What I liked about this movie was that it wasn't just another ""Halloween Michael"" invincible killer guy who lurks in the shadows and attacks naughty teenagers movie, this plot involves a dark cult of lunatics who are on a mission to terrorize the town's folks, but we are never really given an explanation at all if they have influences of a mystical magic super power, or if they are all just completely insane.

 The movie does sort of work, so I will give this B level trash film a grade of a mild thumbs up, and B-, maybe recommended for ages 15 to adult (only if one is a fan of bad horror flicks).  Very weird and very 80's dated kind of slasher film.  Not a good movie at all, but better than it's peers at that time which were not that much higher above the level of subterranean toxic waste.",1447459200,2,2684,4.546777546777546
