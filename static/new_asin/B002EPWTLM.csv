8368154,5,B002EPWTLM,"I love all of Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra's concerts that I've watched.  I am disappointed that I can no longer get the 2016 Maastricht concert.  That was the one that hooked me and I set out to spread the word to friends and family members.  I have tickets for the Tampa, Florida, November 1, 2017 concert but still have a hotel reservation problem.",1500076800,,366,4.515151515151516

8368157,5,B002EPWTLM,"Excellent collection of performances from a few of the ""Live At"" DVDs. Well put together and very enjoyable. Only complaint is that the cover text on the back is in German instead of English. Most of the performances were from the Royal Albert Hall and Berlin concerts. My favorite tracks were Bolero, Hava Nagila, Zorba's Dance, Kalinka and Amazing Grace.",1274832000,6,356,4.95
