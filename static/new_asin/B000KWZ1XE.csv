8159512,5,B000KWZ1XE,"Kodocha really is worth it. It can be called silly, because it is but it's not only that. Kodocha is a show that contains really serious subjects and just covers it with a layer of childish-ness so it's both fun and memorable. I've read the manga and watched most of the entire show (including subs from the second season that hasn't been dubbed in english) and it's the perfect thing to make you happy and see how things are from a different perspective.

I can honestly say (and am proud of it, too) that Kodocha has changed my life for the better.",1261526400,3,550,4.392156862745098

8159514,4,B000KWZ1XE,"I absolutely love this show.  This set takes you through where Sana meets her real mother (an absolutely touching story arc).  I bought this as a gift for a young relative and only learned recently that the first disk would not play the beginning of the first episode, so don't wait around to check your shipment.  The disk looks perfect, it just won't play at the start through the first 5 minutes.  I still highly recommend the show, and don't let this stop you from buying this set.",1220745600,2,485,4.4772727272727275
8159515,5,B000KWZ1XE,"That's odd that I only see one review so far,  besides myself.
I had purchaged this set because it looked like it would be cute.
It's a silly,  anime.  Not the best of art.. but a funny series that can brighten anyones day.
I am sure kids would be more into this than adults, considering Sana tends to break into songs on occasion. hah
Rene` did hate it though,  and tell me to watch it when he was at work or not around or playing his video games...  Either way.  Cute anime.. worth watching, in my opinion",1209427200,3,507,4.175257731958763
8159516,4,B000KWZ1XE,"I don't watch this series too much, because the main character, Sana, can tend to be too hyper at times. However, this is a fun series that can get me out of any funk.
Kodocha follows a 6th grader girl named Sana, who wants to keep the boys from mistreating the teacher. Most importantly, she has to find a way to force the leader, Akito, to stop the group. Sana truly is the spotlight of the series. She dances like an Egyptian at times. On her TV show, she yells at how horrible Akito is. She also involves Akito in a bungee-jump contest. Yet, in her battle against Akito, she learns how difficult his family is. Somehow, she begins to like Akito more and more.
I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this series, because it is almost too hyper at times when it needs to settle down. However, the characters are very lovable. Sana learns how to care for her friends, even when they go through tough times. This series is surprisingly warm and fun.",1190764800,5,944,4.46242774566474
