8302761,5,B001FVK5XU,"I purchased all 3 seasons of Jonathan Bird's Blue World for my 5 year old grandson.  He is so enamored with sharks and all things that live in the oceans.  I gave these to him while on a whole family vacation to the beach.  The entire family enjoyed watching these informative DVDs.  Mr. Bird is an engaging person who never speaks down to his audience (which is primarily children), but offers them a great wealth of knowledge.  If you have a child who loves the ocean and all its creatures, this is the series for them.",1404172800,2,521,4.385416666666667

8302763,4,B001FVK5XU,"Very interesting show! Bird is engaging and does a good job of conveying information without being didactic. My 5-year-old loves this, and the short segments and relatively laid-back mood make this perfect entertainment for times when he needs to chill out briefly or his parents need to get something done.",1388448000,,307,5.16
8302764,5,B001FVK5XU,"Jonathan Bird is slightly quirky, funny and incredibly educational. He loves the ocean and projects that enthusiasm in his work.

I stumbled upon Jonathan Bird online when I was studying the ocean with my then-3 yr old. On Jonathan's website, he has mini webisodes (I had never seen him on PBS). Within one 8 minute episode, my 3 yr old was hooked! We watched only 3 mini episodes that day but for the next week, he told everyone we met 'Did you know the Goliath Grouper is as big as a refrigerator?' He also would tell people all about Jonathan Bird and how much he loves the ocean. As a special treat, we've been watching a couple of the mini episodes each week (the webisode on Antartica is fantastic!). I just bought Season 1 for my son's 4th birthday, and really wish I had bought it before. We watched 2 full length episodes as a very special treat (we're restrictive on tv usage) and he has been regaling me for the last two days with all the details he's learned.

The first season has 5 episodes, about 27 minutes each.
Episode 1:
Blue Shark Adventure
Ginnie Spring Cavern Exploration
Giants of the Depths

Episode 2:
Swimming With Jaws
The Bandana Game
The Shark and the Whale

The Shark with the Tall Tail

Episode 4:

Episode 5:

In the next week or so, I will be buying Jonathan Bird's 2nd and 3rd season, we're that thrilled.",1377475200,,1514,4.523809523809524
8302765,5,B001FVK5XU,Great short videos! My 3 year old would rather watch this than cartoons! Jonathan Bird is wonderful in explaining the blue world. Beautiful photography.,1376524800,,152,5.375
8302766,5,B001FVK5XU,Jonathan Birds Blue world is a fantastic creation. It's entertaining and educational. My son now 4 years old is addicted to the series. His new favorite is Sully from season 3. As a parent I like that he is learning in an enjoyable way. How often can you get a 2 year old and a 4 year old to sit still for 20 minutes? Thank you Jonathan!!!!,1322611200,3,340,4.08955223880597
