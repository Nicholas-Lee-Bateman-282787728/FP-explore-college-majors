8464935,3,B005C7SY4A,"After launching a brilliant viral marketing campaign, the social networking Slasher VLOG finally hits DVD this October! Webcam sensation Brooke Marks broadcasts her life to millions of people online through her video journal 'Brooke Marks the Spot,' but her newfound celebrity attracts a murderous fan with a vlog of their own: 'How to Erase People From the Face of the Earth.' Brooke Marks is great to look at as she prances in front of the camera in various stages of undress, but listening to her prattle on about relationships and trivial nonsense is murder in itself. Perhaps Perez Hilton fans will find this entertaining, but the average Horror fan will grow tired of it quickly. Patience finally pays off, however, as director Joshua Butler tosses in a few crazy murders as well as a killer with a wicked sense of humor that are well worth waiting for. Butler uses the same simple editing techniques found in most amateur video clips to give the film heightened sense of reality. VLOG is not the 'groundbreaking extreme-horror' that it claims to be, but it does splatter the screen with enough partial nudity and gore to satisfy most Slasher fans.

Our obsession with blogs and vlogs and etc. however does not always translate into entertainment.  I was so bored I must admit I didn't even finish it.  I think I'll stick to real movies.",1330732800,2,284,4.62
