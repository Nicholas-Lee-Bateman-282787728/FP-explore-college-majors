2895180,3,B000T9D6W6,"This is a very-well produced video on stretching and the music is excellent. Most of the moves are not difficult, but the main routines are continuous flow from one position to another. Despite an introduction to each routine where Smith shows each of the moves she will be making, when she gets into the actual program she moves rapidly to the music and the positions are hard to follow. One can't watch the video and do the positions, as a lot of them require looking somewhere else to execute properly. I've done this program about 10 times so far, as it is a good balanced workout for posture, flexibility and building core strength, but I still am not in synch with her movements.",1263686400,37,685,4.5772357723577235
2895181,5,B000T9D6W6,"Finally, an exercise DVD that respects our intelligence!  As a previous dancer in my youth, but long out of shape, I enjoyed Ann Smith's dance methods as the basis for the exercise stretching, stregthening, breathing, flexibility moves, and relaxation routines.  This is a must-have exercise DVD for seniors that are ready to be respected by the exercise instructor and her methods.  Please know that being out of shape does not make these routines impossible - Ms. Smith is truely supportive in having you do just what you are able to do and she regularly urges you to listen to your body as it will let you know what it is able to handle.  To top it off, the music is soothing and yet invigorating. A great find in the plethora of condensending ""saccharin sunshine smile"" exercise instructors on the usual senior workout program DVDs.",1225411200,55,836,4.784722222222222
2895182,4,B000T9D6W6,"Ann Smith speaks to the Baby Boomer generation or those of us who may have neglected our body over the years or even pushed too hard. Not wishing for any more jumping aerobic videos, I choose the Ann Smith one and am delighted with the music as well as the gentle stretches she demonstrates. Is it the best on the market? Perhaps not the best but a nice, gentle addition to keep me moving and exercising.",1107475200,13,404,4.328947368421052
2895183,4,B000T9D6W6,"I read with dismay some of the other more negative reviews of this video and understand if you are used to moving mindlessly to fast, aerobic-inducing music, this may not be for you.  But, in defense of Mrs. Smith's unique exercise video, this one time professional ballet dancer, now teacher of over 30 years, found that this video was gentle, yet thorough on the body, resulting with intelligent movement based on many years experience in the field.  The accompanying music  was wonderful, appropriate, and classic like the movement.  I would say that is perfect for the aging baby boom generation, or younger people who need a gentle introduction to exercise.  Whatever the buyer profile, I found it a welcome addition to my 20 some exercise videos.",1050192000,26,752,4.936507936507937
2895184,5,B000T9D6W6,"I had the pleasure of participating in a 40 minute workshop with Mrs. Smith at a YMCA in Nashville this weekend. Her peace, elegance, and confidence inspired our entire class! The stretches she led us in felt wonderful and were very relaxing. We even used movement across the floor, like ballerinas, to stretch our bodies and create energy throughout our bodies. I give Ann Smith an A+++ for inspiration, thorough stretching and a peace generator!",1045958400,18,447,4.973333333333334
2895185,1,B000T9D6W6,"If you are thinking about buying this video, DON'T! The video quality is extremely poor and there is more talking than exercising. This set was so disappointing that if I could return it, I would! The above rating should be 0 star.",1032480000,13,231,4.523809523809524
2895186,1,B000T9D6W6,There is so more talking than actual stretching. In addition the content was extremely disappointing. I would not recommend this.,1406678400,2,129,5.5
2895187,5,B000T9D6W6,This was a good choice. I have bad knees and the exercises in this DVD are not harmful to them. You can take it nice and easy at your own pace. I would and have recommended this to friends.,1401148800,10,189,3.871794871794872
2895188,5,B000T9D6W6,I loved how fast the DVD came and it sure seems brand new.  It will make exercising more fun. Thanks.,1399852800,,101,4.05
2895189,5,B000T9D6W6,Easy to follow and fun to exercise.  Much better for older participants with some limitations to have a good workout routine to keep you mobile.,1378684800,6,144,4.76
2895190,2,B000T9D6W6,Very slow and not very instructive.  Any yoga DVD is probably much better.  Watched this only once and not satisfied.,1373587200,,117,4.8
2895191,3,B000T9D6W6,I found it just to slow for me to get involved. I do think she is an extraordinary person with much to offer but just not for me.,1355011200,2,129,3.642857142857143
2895192,1,B000T9D6W6,Will give it a one star because the dvd still hasn't arrived yet and it was orderd 6 weeks ago! not impressed so far!,1346889600,,117,3.9166666666666665
2895193,3,B000T9D6W6,Fine Ann Smith CD.  Not as good as the original Stretching For Seniors in my opinion.  However still a good one.,1306195200,,112,4.285714285714286
2895194,3,B000T9D6W6,"Not terriby interesting or professionally produced. I only tried it twice and just couldn't get all the way thru it... although I could certainly do the stretches, it was just so boring.

It might be better for older people (60's, 70's, or 80's) or for people who are rehabilitating from some injuries.",1296604800,,302,4.8076923076923075
2895195,1,B000T9D6W6,"I was very disappointed in this and will be selling it at my next garage sale. The music is great (Mozart!) but the moves are very difficult to get up to speed on. Although she goes over each move separately before doing the routine in one continuous flow, she didn't spend enough time on each one for me to be able to pick it up, at least not without constantly pausing and restarting the DVD. I'm not familiar enough with dance to be able to pick up a move that is only demonstrated once, and very quickly at that. I suspect that people with dance training will have an easier time of it. The routine is very graceful - just wish the learning curve wasn't so steep.",1270425600,7,667,4.25984251968504
8208267,5,B000T9D6W6,"I had purchased this video in VHS format several years ago and wanted to get back into the routine so ordered the DVD. After a couple of weeks of exercising with the video, I can now do the routine on my own with classical recordings. I can already see and feel a difference in my 68 year-old body. I'll never be a ballerina, but I can pretend!",1493769600,2,344,4.149253731343284

8208270,3,B000T9D6W6,I tried it one night and it was just too complicated for me.  More for someone with some ballet or yoga experience.,1463529600,,115,4.2272727272727275
8208271,1,B000T9D6W6,The worst!  I expected a regular stretching video with Mozart music playing. Instead I had to sit and listen to a lot of instruction with no workout and when it finally got to doing some of the movements she talked even more through it..horrible. I shut it off with never finishing it. Felt ripped off.,1458518400,4,302,4.490909090909091
8208272,1,B000T9D6W6,I deleted this CD because I found the one I was looking for  Anna Smiths Inhale exhale  but once I look at an item  I cant delete it  YOU SEND IT ANYWAY  LIKE 2  Killer Pancakes  this costs way way to much in YOUR mistakes  why would anyone order 2 of the same book?????,1457654400,,270,3.8703703703703702
8208273,5,B000T9D6W6,I am a senior and this is very good and fun to do.  Love the music and exercises she shares.,1452556800,2,92,3.6
8208274,2,B000T9D6W6,Too slow - boring,1430006400,,17,3.5
8208275,1,B000T9D6W6,"ANN  SMITH  IS  MORE  INTERESTED  IN  SHOWING  WHAT  SHE  CAN  DO ,  THAN  SHE  IS  IN TEACHING  SOMEONE  THE  EXERCISES  . NO  VOICE DIRECTIONS  SHE  FACES  YOU .  IT  WOULD  BE  MUCH  EASIER  TO  FOLLOW  IF  SHE  FACED  AWAY  AND  GAVE  VOICE  INSTRUCTIONS !  IF  YOU WANT  A  GOOD  EXERCISE  PROGRAM.......  GET  A TI  CHI  DVD  YOU WILL FEEL BETTER.
