7892222,4,6305598266,"I found this movie on the ""Hotter Than Hell"" boxed set in a video store back in the late 90's.  If you want this movie, get that boxed set.  It is supposedly better quality than the single-DVD version.

What sold me on the boxed set was this description of Sore Losers:

""They wanted meat, so they ate the flower children!  Hot rod juvenile delinquents and amazons from outer space have come to Memphis to kill hippies!  As if it were drained directly from the big throbbing vein of super 60's sexploitation movies, Sore Losers is an acid flashback thrill ride!  Move over Quentin Tarantino, they don't make 'em like this anymore!""

I don't know what their beef is with hippies, but have no fear, only 1 ""hippie"" gets killed, and it's done in a humourously satirical way.  The main character has died in the past, and has been given a directive by aliens to come back to earth and kill 10 hippies.  He must kill exactly 10, no more and no less, and if he fails this, he will never get back to his current afterlife.  When the movie starts, he has already killed 7, and so only has a few left.  He enlists the help of an overweight and overbearing redhead (Kerine Elkins), who despite that description is actually an enjoyable and humourous character in the movie.  She's hoping to help him out by offering to kill her parents, who I suppose are aged hippies, but really just look and act like rednecks.  Naturally, he goes over his allotment of 10, and bad things start to happen.

I had never heard of any of the ""underground"" actors in this movie, who are apparently musicians in real life, but I will say that their acting is perfectly fine for a movie of this calibre.  If you are used to watching campy B (or worse) horror movies, you will have no problem with the acting and plot here.

This movie is a gem of a find, and I'm so glad I found that box set for $10 back in the early days of DVD in the late 90s.  You can pick it up cheaper now!  Because this movie is so rare and unknown among horror fans, I classify this as a must-see.  If you are a fan of shlocky cult cinema, you will not be disappointed!  This is not a slasher film at all.  It is a surreal cult classic along the lines of Repo Man and Doom Generation, although much less offensive than the latter.

I really wish there was a proper release of this movie that would do it justice.  Having a remastered version on Blu-Ray would be awesome (as if that even needed to be said).",1364083200,,2450,4.299126637554585
