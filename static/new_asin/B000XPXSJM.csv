8229150,1,B000XPXSJM,"I finally was able to get this movie (thankfully for only $5.00) after not succeeding on eBay (I was one of 6 people in a row that they choose to not send the movie to, yet kept listing it for sale. In the ad, director Chris Penney (who wrote a positive review here(""this is really scary!"") for his own film!)states ""Support indie filmmakers & buy this film!"" do yourself a favor & actually send it to someone who purchased it.

Some students & helpers are making a bigfoot documentary in Michigan, after some recent sightings. One student is doing her master thesis on the subject. The hire a guide named Colt and follow him into the woods. They run into 2 pot growers, think they find a footprint, Colt drinks beer, more asinine conversations, eye witnesses (one features  Jay & Silent Bob clones in the background), Colt drinks beer & smokes cigarettes. Smash cut to them lost in the woods at night. Suddenly some canned howls & groans come in earshot and they start screaming. They complain about a horrid smell (I would assume since the student is doing a master thesis on the subject she would have had some experience reading about bigfoot sightings and the smell that is sometime associated with them. It seems to come out of left field here.)

Blair Witch style cinematography (jiggly camera) is seen often in the night shots with screams. It ends as one girl is never found again and a sorrowfully sound narrator tells us such. The end.

The acting is above par than other similar low budget productions and the post-production is decent as well. Story, dialogue is incredibly lame. My biggest pet peeve is that you never see the creature at all. Ever. Nada. As mentioned in the title of this review, decent buildup with zero reward.
